             Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR) , the operator of
filling stations outside about 1,000 Wal-Mart stores, is in
discussions with regulators about which permits may be needed for
the possible expansion of its refinery in Superior,  Wisconsin .  
 Murphy, based in El Dorado,  Arkansas , is talking to the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, according to
spokesman Dory Stiles.  
 The refiner is looking for a partner to expand the plant's
daily capacity of about 35,000 barrels by 200,000 barrels for an
estimated cost of $6 billion. Talks with potential partners are
``an ongoing process,'' Stiles said.  
 The discussions with regulators ``are just preliminary steps
we are taking to keep things moving along as much as we can
without having a deal secured,'' Stiles said in a telephone
interview today. The company plans to apply for regulatory
approval after agreeing on a partnership, he said.  
 Murphy plans to process more Canadian crude at Superior.
Canada's tar sands may contain the most oil after Saudi Arabia,
the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has said. As much
as C$125 billion ($121 billion) may be spent by 2015 to almost
triple oil-sands output to about 3 million barrels a day,
according to Canada's national energy agency.  
 Murphy also owns a 125,000-barrel refinery in Meraux,
 Louisiana , and last month agreed to buy out the 70 percent stake
of its partner, Total SA, in the Milford Haven,  Wales , plant for
$250 million. Milford Haven can process 108,000 barrels a day.  
 Murphy shares rose 72 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $64.54 in
composite trading on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  
 The talks between Murphy and the regulators were reported
earlier by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
