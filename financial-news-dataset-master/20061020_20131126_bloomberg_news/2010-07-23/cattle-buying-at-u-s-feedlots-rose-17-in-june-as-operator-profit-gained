             U.S. feedlots boosted purchases of
young cattle in June by 17 percent from a year earlier, as a
rebound in beef demand brought profits after more than two years
of losses.  
 Feedlots  bought  1.628 million young cattle last month, up
from 1.391 million in June 2009, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a monthly report. The average
expectation of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
19 percent jump. The overall  feedlot herd  totaled 10.07 million,
up 3.3 percent from 9.752 million last year. Analysts expected a
3 percent gain.  
 Feedlots without risk-management plans have made money for
five straight months, after high feed costs and the recession
spurred losses in the previous 32 months, according to  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of Missouri in
Columbia.  Spot-market steer  prices have climbed 12 percent this
year while the cost of  cash corn  has dropped 7.1 percent.  
 “We’re definitely in recovery mode,” said  Daniel Bluntzer , a research director at Frontier Risk Management,
Robstown, Texas. “We’re likely to see profitability for the
rest of the year. I think we’re sitting in a very healthy
situation in the feedlot sector.”  
 Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that weigh
500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn and protein feeds until they weigh
about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  
 Futures Rise  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.325 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 94.725 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The most-active contract has climbed 5.1 percent in
the past year. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose
0.275 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.15175 a pound.  
 The price of wholesale  choice beef , an indicator of demand
for the meat, rallied 12 percent this year through midday, as
the economy recovered from recession. U.S. beef export sales in
the four weeks through July 15 surged 80 percent from the same
period a year earlier, according to USDA data.  
 Feedlots sold  1.997 million head of cattle to meatpackers
in June, little changed from 1.989 million a year earlier, the
USDA said. Analysts expected a 1.5 percent increase, on average.
