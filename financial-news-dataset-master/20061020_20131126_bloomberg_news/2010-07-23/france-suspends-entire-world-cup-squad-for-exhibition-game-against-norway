             The 23 members of the 2010 French
World Cup team will be suspended for an Aug. 11 friendly against
Norway, the French Football Federation said on its  website .  
 The French squad refused to train for a day at the World
Cup to protest striker  Nicolas Anelka  being sent home for
insulting coach  Raymond Domenech . France was eliminated in the
first round after losing two games and drawing one.  
 Laurent Blanc , who took over as national team coach after
the World Cup, will announce Aug. 5 the team to play Norway.  
 The FFF today also elected Fernand Duchaussoy, head of the
country’s amateur leagues, as interim president, replacing Jean-
Pierre Escalettes, who resigned after the World Cup campaign.  
 In a press conference after his election, Duchaussoy said
he’d meet with Domenech in the coming days to discuss several
incidents at the World Cup, such as the manager’s refusal to
shake the hand of South Africa’s coach after the final match and
his failure to inform authorities of Anelka’s locker-room
outburst at half-time of Mexico’s 2-0 win over France. Anelka’s
insults were published in newspaper L’Equipe a day later.  
 “If he quit, I wouldn’t object,” Duchaussoy said when
asked if he’d expel Domenech from the FFF.
