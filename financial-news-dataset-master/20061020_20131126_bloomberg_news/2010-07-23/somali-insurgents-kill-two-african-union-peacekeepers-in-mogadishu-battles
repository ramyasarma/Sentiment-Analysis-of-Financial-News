             Somali insurgents killed two African
Union peacekeepers during fighting this week in the capital,
Mogadishu, the force’s spokesman said.  
 “Two of our soldiers were killed and around three others
sustained injuries,” Barigye Ba-Hoku, spokesman for the  African
Union Mission in Somalia , said today by phone.  
 Islamic militias including al-Shabaab and Hisb-ul-Islam
have been battling Somalia’s government for three years and
control most of southern and central Somalia, and sections of
Mogadishu. Somalia hasn’t had a functioning government since the
ouster of dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  
 Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin bomb attacks
minutes apart in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on July 11 that
killed 76 people watching the soccer World Cup final at an
Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby club.  
 The group said it targeted Uganda because the country has
troops serving in the peacekeeping force in Mogadishu.
