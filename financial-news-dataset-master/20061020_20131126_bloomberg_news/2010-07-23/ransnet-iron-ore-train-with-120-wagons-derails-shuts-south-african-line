             Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s
biggest iron-ore carrier, said more than 120 wagons derailed on
its Sishen-Saldanha railroad yesterday, closing the line in both
directions.  
 “We’re still clearing up the site,”  Sandile Simelane , a
spokesman for state-owned Transnet’s freight rail unit, said by
mobile phone today, adding that it’s too soon to say when the
line will reopen. “It’s quite a big derailment,” Simelane
said.  
 The 861-kilometer (535-mile) railway is a single line built
to carry iron ore for export mainly from mines near Sishen in
the Northern Cape to the port at Saldanha in the Western Cape.
The line transports about 34 million metric tons a year of the
steel-making ingredient, according to Transnet’s  website .  
 Kumba, the biggest user of the railroad, said it wasn’t
able to confirm whether its shipments were affected by the
closure. The derailed train wasn’t carrying  Kumba  iron ore,
Pretoria-based spokesman  Gert Schoeman  said in an e-mail.
