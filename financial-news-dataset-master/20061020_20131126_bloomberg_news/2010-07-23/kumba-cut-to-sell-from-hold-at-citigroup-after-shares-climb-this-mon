             Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., a unit of Anglo
American Plc, was cut to “sell” from “hold” by Citigroup
Inc. after the share price rose this month.  
 “We believe the good news is now priced in and our target
price offers a total one-year expected return of only 2.4
percent,” Johannesburg-based analyst Johann Pretorius wrote in
a note today. Kumba’s share-price estimate was raised to 360
rand, from 340 rand.
