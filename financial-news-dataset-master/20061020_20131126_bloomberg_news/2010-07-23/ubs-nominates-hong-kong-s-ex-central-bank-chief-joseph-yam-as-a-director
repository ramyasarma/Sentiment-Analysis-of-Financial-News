             UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
nominated  Joseph Yam , founder and former chief executive officer
of the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority , for election to its board
of directors next year.  
 Yam, who was CEO of the authority, Hong Kong’s central
bank, for more than 16 years until retiring last September, is
set to join the board at the bank’s annual general meeting on
April 28, Zurich-based UBS said today in an e-mailed statement.
Pending regulatory approval, Yam was earlier this year elected
to the board of China Construction Bank Corp., the world’s
second-largest lender by market value, UBS said.  
 “Joseph’s presence will significantly expand the
geographic diversity of the board, and provide powerful
additional impetus to the growth of our already market leading
investment bank and wealth management businesses in Asia
Pacific,” UBS Chairman  Kaspar Villiger  said in the statement.  
 UBS plans to increase headcount in the Asia-Pacific region
to 9,500 in three years from 7,300. The bank is competing with
Swiss rivals such as Credit Suisse Group AG to hire so-called
relationship managers in Asia as heightened scrutiny of
individuals’ tax affairs in Europe drives them to seek rich
customers living in the world’s fastest-growing economies.
