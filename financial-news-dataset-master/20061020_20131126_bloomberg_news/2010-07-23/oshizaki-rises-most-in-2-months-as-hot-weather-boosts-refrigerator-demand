             Hoshizaki Electric Co.  gained the
most in more than two months as high temperatures in Japan spur
demand for the company’s refrigerators and ice-making machines.  
 Hoshizaki rose 6.4 percent to 1,564 yen as of 11 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest increase since May 12. It
has risen 18 percent this year, compared with an 11 drop in the
benchmark  Nikkei 225  Average.  
 “The market is looking for beneficiaries of hot weather --
air-conditioners, drinks, beer,” said  Mariko Watanabe , a Tokyo-
based analyst at Credit Suisse AG who has an “outperform”
rating on the Aichi-Prefecture based company.  
 “Under the hot weather, corporate clients will replace old
refrigerators for new ones,” Watanabe said. Refrigerator and
drink dispenser manufacturers’ “profit is concentrated around
June, July and August, and as long as we have hot weather, it’s
their peak time,” she said.  
 Nagoya, the capital of Aichi Prefecture and Japan’s third
largest industrial center after Tokyo and Osaka, yesterday saw
temperatures reach 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit),
according to the  Japan Meteorological Agency . Tajimi, a city
near Nagoya, hit a record high for July of 39.4 degrees.
