             A Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority investigation of abuses in mortgage-linked investments
has focused on the activities of  Morgan Stanley , Barclays PLC
and  Credit Suisse Group AG , a person with direct knowledge of
the matter said.  
 The brokerage regulator has sought information on so-called
synthetic collateralized debt obligations the firms created,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the inquiry is confidential. Finra has concentrated on whether
the banks became mired in a conflict of interest by betting that
their own CDOs, tied to home loans, would lose value.  
 The probe has also focused on the firms’ sales practices
and on how they picked the mortgage bonds that underpinned the
investments, the person said.  
 Finra, based in Washington, hasn’t accused Morgan Stanley,
Credit Suisse or  Barclays  of wrongdoing in connection with their
CDOs.  
 The inquiry mirrors efforts by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to crack down on investment banks and collateral
managers for their roles in selling and managing complex
products that fueled losses during the financial crisis. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. last week said it made a “mistake” and agreed
to pay a record $550 million to settle SEC claims that it
defrauded investors by not disclosing the role played by hedge
fund Paulson & Co. in devising and betting against a mortgage-
linked CDO known as Abacus.  
 ‘Powerful Player’  
 “Once the SEC took on the most powerful player on Wall
Street, Goldman Sachs, it follows that” both the SEC and Finra
“would seek to take similar positions in similar cases,”  John Coffee , a securities law professor at Columbia University in New
York, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  
 Barclays Capital spokesman  Brandon Ashcraft  said the firm
doesn’t comment on its communication with regulators. Credit
Suisse spokesman  Duncan King  and Morgan Stanley spokesman  Mark Lake  declined to comment. Two telephone calls and an e-mail to
Finra spokeswoman  Nancy Condon  weren’t returned.  
 Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said
in a Feb. 26 filing with the SEC that it is responding to
subpoenas and requests for information from regulators
concerning mortgage-linked products including CDOs.  
 Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, is Switzerland’s second-
largest bank. Barclays, based in London, is the U.K.’s third-
biggest lender.  
 Deutsche Bank  
 Finra, the industry-funded brokerage regulator, fined
Deutsche Bank AG’s investment-bank unit $7.5 million this week,
saying the Frankfurt-based bank misled investors by understating
delinquency rates on subprime mortgage-backed securities it sold
in 2006. Several firms are being investigated for similar
violations,  James Shorris , Finra’s acting enforcement chief,
said in an interview on July 21, declining to provide details of
specific probes.  
 Bloomberg News reported in May that New York-based Morgan
Stanley bet against a cluster of CDOs known as Baldwin, which
were structured to keep wagering on mortgage bonds as the
underlying loans were paid down rather than reducing their bets.
That left investors facing losses on a modest rise in U.S.
housing defaults, while Morgan Stanley was positioned to gain.
The SEC has been investigating for more than a year whether
banks misled investors in CDOs tied to home loans.  
 Morgan Stanley also designed other similar products,
including one called ABSpoke and two groups of deals named after
U.S. presidents. Credit Suisse and Barclays have also created
synthetic CDOs linked to subprime loans, under series called
Arlo and Magnolia, respectively.  
 ICP Suit  
 The SEC, which is examining a range of firms and structured
products, sued ICP Asset Management last month for its role
overseeing CDOs known as Triaxx. The firm favored itself and
certain clients by directing more than $1 billion of trades at
artificially high prices on behalf of the CDOs.  
 That lawsuit emerged from a sweep of more than 50
investment advisers that manage structured financial products,
probing the firms’ possible conflicts of interest and whether
they appropriately priced assets during times of market stress.  
 CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. Finra’s
probe focuses on synthetic CDOs, which are only linked to the
performance of certain assets rather than actually owning them.
