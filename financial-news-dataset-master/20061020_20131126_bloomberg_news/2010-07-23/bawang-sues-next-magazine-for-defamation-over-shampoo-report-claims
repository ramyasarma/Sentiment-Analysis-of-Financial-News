             BaWang International (Group)
Holding Ltd. , China’s largest herbal shampoo maker, filed a
complaint against Next Magazine Publishing Ltd. over a report
that said two of its products contain a substance that may
cause cancer.  
 BaWang is seeking unspecified damages from the weekly for
“defamation” and “malicious falsehood,” according to the
complaint filed in Hong Kong’s High Court July 21. It’s also
claiming compensation for loss of sales, it said.  
 Next Magazine Editor-in-Chief Lee Chi-ho wasn’t available
for comment.  
 BaWang , which uses movie star  Jackie Chan  and Chinese pop
singer  Faye Wong  to promote its products, slumped 23 percent
from July 14 to July 16 after the report said two of the
company’s products contain a substance that may cause cancer.
The company’s market capitalization declined by HK$3.9 billion
in those three trading days.  
 The herbal shampoo products don’t threaten consumers’
health, China’s State Food and Drug Administration said on July
16.  
 BaWang  rose 0.2 percent to HK$4.90 at 11:43 a.m. in Hong
Kong trading.
