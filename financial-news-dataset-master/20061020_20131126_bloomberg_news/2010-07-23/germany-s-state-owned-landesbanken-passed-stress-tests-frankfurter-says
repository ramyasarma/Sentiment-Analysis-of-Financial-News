             All of Germany’s Landesbanken have
passed a European regulatory stress test on banks, Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 Some banks received results of the Committee of European
Banking Supervisors’s test yesterday afternoon, the German
newspaper said.
