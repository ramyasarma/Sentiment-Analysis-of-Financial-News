             Schlumberger Ltd. , the world’s
largest oilfield-services provider, said second-quarter profit
climbed 33 percent as gains in crude prices spurred increased
exploration and production spending by customers.  
 Net income rose to $818 million, or 68 cents a share, from
$613 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier,  Schlumberger , based
in Houston and Paris, said today in a statement. Profit matched
the average of 30 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Revenue advanced 7.4 percent to $5.94 billion as increasing
work on  U.S. onshore  and Latin American projects made up for a
moratorium on deep-water Gulf of Mexico drilling permits. The
company expects a “continued slow build” in services demand
around the world in this year’s second half, Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Gould  said in the statement.  
 “Their outlook remains positive but measured,” said  Dan Pickering , an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. in Houston
whose firm has a “buy” rating on Schlumberger shares. “In
other words, business isn’t exploding to the upside but kind of
grinding higher.”  
 Schlumberger’s French shares rose 0.3 percent to 47.25
euros at 12:50 p.m. in Paris. The company’s U.S.  stock  has
dropped 9.7 percent since the April 20 rig explosion that led to
the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 Spending Seen Rising  
 Exploration and production spending by oil companies will
rise 12 percent this year, even as the permit ban triggered by
BP Plc’s record U.S. oil spill slows drilling in the Gulf,
Barclays Capital estimated last month.  
 Oil futures in New York averaged $78.05 a barrel in the
second quarter, 31 percent higher than a year earlier.  
 Halliburton Co. , the world’s second-largest oilfield
contractor, said July 19 that its second-quarter profit surged
83 percent as gains in onshore drilling more than made up for
the business slowdown in the Gulf.  
 Schlumberger agreed in February to buy Houston-based  Smith
International Inc. , which is a partner with the company in the
M-I Swaco drilling-fluids joint venture. The companies certified
this month that they are in “substantial compliance” with a
second request for information on the deal from the U.S.
government.
