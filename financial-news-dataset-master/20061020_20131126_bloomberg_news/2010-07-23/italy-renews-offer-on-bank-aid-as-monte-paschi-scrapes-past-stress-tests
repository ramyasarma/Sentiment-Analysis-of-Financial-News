             Italy renewed an offer to buy bonds
from lenders that need to raise capital after Monte dei Paschi
di Siena SpA passed a stress test with a capital buffer of less
than 235 million euros ($303 million).  
 Five Italian banks -- Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA,
UniCredit SpA, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Monte Paschi and Banco
Popolare SC -- passed the region-wide tests of 91 European
banks. The exams assessed whether the lenders had enough capital
to withstand a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, with a Tier
1 capital ratio of 6 percent as a threshold.  
 European Central Bank Governing Council member  Ewald Nowotny  today suggested that more banks might have failed the
tests if they hadn’t received financial help during the crisis,
Austria Press Agency reported. Italy’s Finance Ministry said
today in a statement that it would lend to banks if necessary.  
 Intesa, Italy’s second-biggest lender, had the biggest
capital ratio. Its tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, dropped to 8.2 percent in the test’s worst-case
scenarios. That contrasts with Monte Paschi’s tier 1 capital
ratio of 6.2 percent and Popolare’s 7 percent. Both those
lenders received state aid last year.  
 Capital Buffers  
 While Intesa’s capital buffer was 8.5 billion euros, Monte
Paschi’s was only 235 million euros. Siena-based Monte Paschi
said today in a statement that it “will not weaken” its pledge
on “capital strengthening.” It forecast the planned sale of 72
branches and reorganization of its asset-management unit and
real-estate business will boost capital ratios.  
 Banco Popolare SC in June 2009 became the first Italian
bank to get financial help after it secured government backing
for a 1.45 billion-euro convertible bond.  Monte Paschi  secured
1.9 billion euros last year in state aid to boost its capital.
Two smaller Italian banks that weren’t stress-tested also got
state aid last year.  
 The Bank of Italy defended the stress-test criteria as
“rigorous and severe.” Italian lenders are “solid and ready
to face the future,” banking lobby ABI said in a statement.  
 “We are confident that this will put an end to the rumors
and uncertainty that have formed in the market, and create a
climate of confidence,” Bank of Italy Deputy General Director
 Anna Maria Tarantola  told reporters in Rome.
