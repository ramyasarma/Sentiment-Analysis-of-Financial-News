             Mark Cavendish  won his fourth stage
at this year’s Tour de France as  Alberto Contador  kept an eight-
second lead with two days left.  
 Cavendish sprinted ahead at the end of the flat 18th stage
between Salies-de-Bearn and Bordeaux and had time to look over
his shoulder before crossing the finishing line.  
 Defending champion Contador leads  Andy Schleck  in the
overall standings. There is a time trial tomorrow before the
race ends July 25 in Paris.  
 Spain’s Contador is a time-trial specialist who beat
Schleck of Luxembourg by 1 minute, 45 seconds in the discipline
over 25 miles last year.  
 Leading riders stayed bunched together and didn’t compete
for places in the 123-mile stage that followed yesterday’s final
mountain stage in the Pyrenees.  
 “It was a calm stage but you had to be careful because of
the wind,” Contador said.  
 The Spaniard pulled on the yellow jersey in a ceremony
after the stage with actor  Tom Cruise  and actress  Cameron Diaz 
standing alongside him.  
 Spain’s  Samuel Sanchez  is third overall, 3 minutes, 32
seconds behind Contador.  Denis Menchov  of Russia is 21 second
further back.  
 Thor Hushovd  lost the green jersey that sprinters compete
for to  Alessandro Petacchi  after finishing 14th today. Cavendish
is behind them in third.  
 “The green jersey is finished for me,” Hushovd told
French television. “It’s disappointing but that’s life.”
