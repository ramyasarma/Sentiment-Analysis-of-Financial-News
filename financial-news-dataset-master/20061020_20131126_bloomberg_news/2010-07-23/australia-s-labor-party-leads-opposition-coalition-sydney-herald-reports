             Australia’s ruling Labor Party is
leading the opposition coalition in voter support, buoyed by a
surge of women coming out in favor of Prime Minister Julia
Gillard, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, citing a
Herald/Nielsen poll. Labor leads the Coalition 54 percent to 46
percent on a two-party preferred basis, according to a survey of
1,400 voters taken from July 20 to 22. Some 56 percent of voters
approve of Gillard’s performance, compared with 43 percent who
are happy with opposition leader Tony Abbott.
