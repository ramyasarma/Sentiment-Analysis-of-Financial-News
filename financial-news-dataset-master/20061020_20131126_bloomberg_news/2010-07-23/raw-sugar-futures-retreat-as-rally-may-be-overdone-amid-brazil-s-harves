             Sugar futures fell in New York on
speculation that a rally to a four-month high was overdone amid
a bumper crop in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer.  
 Output in Brazil will total 37.5 million metric tons in the
year that began on April 1, up 14 percent from a year earlier,
Datagro Ltd. said today in a report. Dry weather will allow
growers to speed up harvesting and finish as early as December,
the Sao-Paulo based researcher said. Sugar surged 4.8 percent
yesterday, the most this month.  
 “What we’re seeing is a natural setback,” said  Jeff Bauml , a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a
broker in New York. “There’s some profit-taking in long
positions. Nothing has changed in fundamentals.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.03 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 18.27 cents a pound at 11:55 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 18.66 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since March 22, and
fell as much as 1.1 percent.  
 Sugar will trade in a range of 17 cents to 19 cents, Bauml
said.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined sugar for October
delivery dropped $5.70, or 1 percent, to $554 a ton, after
touching $571, the highest level since March 9.
