             San Miguel Corp. , the biggest food
and drinks maker in the Philippines, said there are two
remaining bidders for a minority stake in its poultry and hot
dog unit, down from as many as five.  
 “The two bidders will proceed to further due diligence
prior to final negotiations,” President  Ramon Ang  said today,
without naming them. San Miguel earlier this year valued the
unit,  San Miguel Pure Foods Co. , at $1.8 billion  
 The Carylye Group was among the bidders for a stake in
 Pure Foods , the biggest hot-dog maker in the Philippines, Ang
had said July 20. The Washington-based private equity firm
company was vying against the Gokongwei, Aboitiz and Campos
families, he said at the time.  
 A sale would help replenish the acquisition funds of  San
Miguel , which is  expanding  into industries including railways,
energy, telecommunications and mining that it says have a
return on equity that’s triple that of its “traditional” food
and beverage businesses.  San Miguel  had 121.07 billion pesos
($2.6 billion) in cash and near-cash assets as of March 31,
compared with 209.4 billion pesos three months before then.  
 San Miguel’s  A shares , which are reserved for Filipinos,
rose 0.75 percent to close at 67.50 pesos in Manila trading.,
paring their decline this year to 1.5 percent. The company’s  B
shares , which don’t have ownership restrictions, were unchanged
at 68 pesos.  
 Pure Foods Earnings  
 Pure Foods’ profit  will probably rise 10 percent to 15
percent this year and sales may grow about 10 percent to 83
billion pesos, President  Francisco Alejo  said May 14.  
 The company, which also raises poultry, had record
earnings of 2.6 billion pesos in 2009 on 75.04 billion pesos
sales. It posted 77.19 million pesos net income in 2008 on
71.08 billion pesos of sales.  
 First-quarter profit at  Pure Foods , which has 44 percent
of the Philippine poultry market and 63 percent of its hotdog
sales, rose to 872 million pesos from 143 million pesos. Sales
rose 2 percent to 18.2 billion pesos.  
 Ang has said he plans to raise $1 billion more by selling
assets and plans to spend $2 billion this year on acquisitions.
 San Miguel , which began as a brewer in 1890, has raised about
$3 billion from asset sales since 2008 as it seeks to diversify
in a process Chairman  Eduardo Cojuangco  said will “secure”
the company’s future.
