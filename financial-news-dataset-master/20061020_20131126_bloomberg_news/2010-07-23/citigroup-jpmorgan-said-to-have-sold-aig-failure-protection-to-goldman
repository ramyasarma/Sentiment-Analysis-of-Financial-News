             Citigroup Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. are among the banks that sold  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
protection against a failure of insurer  American International
Group Inc. , said two people with knowledge of the transactions.  
 Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley
are also among banks that helped Goldman Sachs hedge against the
risk of an AIG collapse, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the contracts were private.  
 Goldman Sachs has turned over a list of counterparties to
the  Congressional Oversight Panel  and Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, which are reviewing the use of taxpayer funds in
financial bailouts, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. Had AIG been allowed to fail in 2008, instead of
receiving a government rescue that swelled to $182.3 billion,
the banks may have had to make payments to Goldman Sachs.  
 “AIG didn’t go down, and these banks didn’t have to pay
out to Goldman for the protection they sold,” said  Ed Grebeck ,
chief executive officer of Stamford, Connecticut-based debt-
consulting firm Tempus Advisors and an instructor at New York
University on derivatives.  
 Lucas van Praag , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment.  Renee Calabro  of Deutsche Bank,
Credit Suisse’s  Duncan King , Morgan Stanley’s  Mark Lake ,
JPMorgan’s  Brian Marchiony  and Citigroup’s  Danielle Romero- Apsilos  had no comment.  
 Mortgage-Linked Securities  
 AIG’s rescue was designed to prevent a wider financial
collapse. Banks including Goldman Sachs bought $62.1 billion in
insurance on mortgage-linked securities from AIG. To protect
itself against the possibility AIG would be unable to honor its
obligations, Goldman Sachs bought credit-default  swaps  that
would’ve paid out in the event of an AIG bankruptcy, Goldman
Sachs Chief Financial Officer  David Viniar  has said.  
 When asked in March 2009 which firms sold Goldman Sachs the
protection, Viniar said it was “really all of the large
financial institutions” in and outside the U.S.  
 “That would be who you’d get protection from,” Grebeck
said. “You’d go to big, highly rated counterparties like
that.”  
 Goldman Sachs got $12.9 billion after AIG’s rescue as
bailout funds helped the insurer honor its contracts with Wall
Street firms. The bank’s hedges against AIG were a reason
Goldman Sachs wouldn’t accept anything less than full payment on
the guarantees it purchased from the insurer, Viniar said last
year, without indentifying the firms.  
 “We want to know the identity of those parties, partly
just to know where American taxpayer dollars went, but partly to
assess Goldman’s claim,” said  Elizabeth Warren , chairman of the
Congressional Oversight Panel, in a Senate hearing this week.
“We cannot evaluate the credibility of their claim that they
had nothing at stake one way or the other in the AIG bailout.”
