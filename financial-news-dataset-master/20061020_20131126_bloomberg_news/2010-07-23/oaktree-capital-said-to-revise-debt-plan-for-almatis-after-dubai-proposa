             Oaktree Capital Management LLC , an
asset manager battling Dubai International Capital LLC for
control of Almatis, plans to revise its debt-restructuring plan
for the German alumina-products maker, a person familiar with
the situation said.  
 Oaktree plans to offer junior lenders of Frankfurt-based
Almatis some immediate recovery of their debt, compared with its
existing proposal where recovery can only be achieved if Almatis
is sold for more than $325 million, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information is private.  
 Oaktree, the largest senior lender to Almatis, plans to
file the revised plan to the U.S. bankruptcy court next week,
the person said.  
 The Los Angeles-based private-equity firm is amending the
restructuring proposal as  Dubai International  got $535 million
of underwritten debt financing that would help fully repay
Almatis senior lenders including Oaktree.  
 A London-based spokeswoman for Oaktree declined to comment.  
 Dubai International paid about $1.2 billion for Almatis in
2007, according to a court filing. The deal was financed with
$970 million of loans underwritten by banks including UBS AG and
Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp., Bloomberg data show.
