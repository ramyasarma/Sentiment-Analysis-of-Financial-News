             Apple Inc.  delayed the release of
the white iPhone 4 for the second time, saying the model is
still harder to manufacture than expected.  
 The white model will be available later this year, the
Cupertino, California-based company said today in a statement.
The black models are not affected, it said.  
 Apple sold 1.7 million of the black model iPhone 4, which
features video calling, in the first three days after its June
debut. That month, the company postponed releasing the white
model until the second half of July, citing unexpected
manufacturing challenges.  
 Apple has been contending with criticism over the design of
the iPhone 4 antenna, which results in diminished signal
strength. After the phone’s introduction, users complained of
lost reception when they held it in a way that covers the
bottom-left corner. Consumer Reports opted not to recommend the
device, the first time the group hasn’t given its imprimatur to
an iPhone.  
 Apple is giving every iPhone 4 buyer a free rubberized case
called a Bumper, which lessens the problem. People who already
bought a $29 Bumper can get a refund.  
 The iPhone has become Apple’s top-selling product since its
2007 debut, accounting for 34 percent of the company’s  sales 
last quarter.  
 Apple fell $1.60 to $257.42 at 9:55 a.m. New York time
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares had climbed 23 percent
this year before today.
