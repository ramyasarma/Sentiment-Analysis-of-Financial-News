             Bertelsmann AG ’s  RTL Group SA  agreed
to sell its U.K. television station Channel 5 to  Richard Desmond , owner of the Daily Express newspaper and Television X
adult channel, for 125 million euros ($161 million) in cash.  
 Channel 5, which broadcasts shows such as crime series
“CSI” and “Law & Order,” will be sold to Desmond’s Northern
& Shell holding company with “immediate effect,” RTL said in a
statement today.  
 “The disposal is in line with RTL Group’s strategy of
being number one or two in each of our markets,” said RTL Chief
Executive Officer  Gerhard Zeiler . “With a significant recovery
of the U.K. TV advertising market and Five performing well in
the first half of 2010, we saw a window of opportunity.”  
 RTL,  Europe’s biggest broadcaster  with 45 TV channels and
31 radio stations in 11 countries, repeatedly has said that the
U.K. TV market is overcrowded. RTL, based in Luxembourg, last
year called for a merger of Channel 5 with Channel Four
Television Corp., a publicly owned and commercially funded
broadcaster.  
 Desmond owns OK! magazine as well as adult television
subscription channels through his Northern & Shell holding
company. Desmond, who formerly published Penthouse magazine in
the U.K., sold his adult magazine titles in 2004.  
 RTL’s Five Group, which runs Channel 5, posted  an operating
loss  of 10 million euros for 2009 as sales dropped 30 percent to
303 million euros. Its share of the television advertising
market dropped to 8.4 percent from 9.6 percent.  
 RTL is a unit of closely-held Bertelsmann AG, Europe’s
biggest media company. Bertelsmann owns 91 percent of RTL. RTL
said it was advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co on the Channel 5
sale.
