             Senegal should almost double
investment in public works projects to improve transport times
and power supplies, enabling private industry to realize its
“enormous” growth potential, said Clemencia de Mastle, a World
Bank official.  
 The West African country needs to invest 20 percent of its
gross domestic product in transport and energy projects, the
bank’s coordinator for infrastructure diagnosis told a
conference in the capital, Dakar, today.  
 Poor infrastructure costs Senegal per capita GDP growth of
1.3 percentage points each year, with average transport speeds
of less than 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) an hour, de Mastle said,
citing an Africa-wide investigation of public services.  
 “This has an immense impact on Senegal’s
competitiveness,” she said. “The energy situation is
catastrophic.”  
 Senegal needs to add generating capacity of at least 258
megawatts, with consumers currently relying on private
generators for 25 percent of their power needs, up from 7
percent at the beginning of the decade, the study found.  
 The country is currently investing $911 million in public
works projects a year, including power plants and a system of
highways around the capital, an amount that is just 55 percent
of the World Bank’s suggested infrastructure spending, according
to the report.
