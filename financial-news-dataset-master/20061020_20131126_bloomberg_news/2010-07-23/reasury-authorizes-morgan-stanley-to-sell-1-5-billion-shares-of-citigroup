             The U.S. government is resuming
sales of its stock in  Citigroup Inc.  after suspending them at
the end of June for a “blackout period” preceding a July 16
report on the U.S. bank’s second-quarter earnings.  
 The Treasury Department, which currently owns 5.1 billion
Citigroup shares, or an 18 percent stake, said in an e-mailed
statement today it has granted discretion to broker Morgan
Stanley to sell another 1.5 billion shares. The Treasury, which
began selling down its stake in April, has said it wants to
liquidate the rest by the end of the year.  
 The bank’s stock price climbed 8.8 percent from June 30
through yesterday’s closing price of $4.09 in New York trading.
Since the sales began in April, Treasury has received $10.5
billion of gross proceeds for 2.6 billion shares, or an average
of $4.04 each.  
 The government got its stock in Citigroup, the third-
biggest U.S. bank, last year after agreeing to convert $25
billion of bailout funds into common shares at a price of $3.25
each, for a total of 7.7 billion shares and a 27 percent stake.
The New York-based bank received a $45 billion rescue in 2008
and repaid $20 billion in December.
