             Toys “R” Us Inc. , the retailer
acquired by KKR & Co., Bain Capital Partners LLC and Vornado
Realty Trust in 2005 for $7.5 billion, is said to seek a $1.8
billion revolving line of credit, people familiar with the
matter said.  
 The largest U.S. toy-store will use the revolver to
refinance a $1.61 billion credit line that matures in May 2012,
the people said, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The financing will be secured by the company’s
receivables and inventory.  
 Toys “R” Us is seeking to extend the maturity on its
credit line as the Wayne, New Jersey-based company tries to
improve its credit profile since the 2005 leveraged buyout added
debt to its balance sheet. The company, which had long-term debt
of $4.9 billion as of May 1, plans to raise as much as $800
million in an initial public offering.  
 Bank of America Corp. is arranging the financing, one of
the people said.  
 Kathleen Waugh , a Toys “R” Us spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  
 The company’s existing credit line is part of a $2.12
billion loan that was arranged by Bank of America in July 2005.
Toys “R” Us also has a $804 million term loan of which $798
million is outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The interest on the loan is 4.25 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. Libor is the
rate banks charge to lend to each other.  
 Moody’s Investors Service put the retailer’s B2 rating on
review for possible upgrade after Toys “R” Us said it would use
the proceeds to retire debt.
