             General Electric Co. , emerging from
the global recession with a hoard of cash, raised its quarterly
dividend by 20 percent and will resume stock buybacks sooner
than it had predicted. The shares rose.  
 GE said in a statement it raised the per-share payout to 12
cents a quarter from 10 cents. The company extended stock
repurchases through 2013 from the end of this year, and plans to
begin buying shares this quarter.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is scaling back some
of the cash-saving steps he adopted in 2008 as the financial
crisis deepened. GE said July 16 that it expects to have $25
billion in cash at the parent company level by year-end.  
 “We are able to restore the GE dividend at a historical
payout level for 2010 earlier than previously anticipated and to
extend our share buyback program because of continued strong
cash generation, recovery at GE Capital, and solid underlying
 performance  in our industrial businesses through the first half
of 2010,” Immelt said in the statement.  
 GE, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, cut its  dividend  in
February 2009 to 10 cents a share from 31 cents, the first
reduction since the Great Depression, as the company worked to
bolster the finance unit. Immelt said in May he planned to raise
the dividend and increase buybacks by 2011.  
 At the time, Bloomberg  estimates  showed a payout of 12
cents a share, up from 10 cents.  
 GE rose 31 cents, or 2 percent, to $15.52 at 1:08 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
