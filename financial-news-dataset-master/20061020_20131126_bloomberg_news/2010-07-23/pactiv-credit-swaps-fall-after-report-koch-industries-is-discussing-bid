             The cost to protect  Pactiv Corp. 
bonds against losses fell close to a four-week low after a
report that Koch Industries Inc. is in talks to buy the maker of
Hefty trash bags. Pactiv shares rose to the highest since
October 2007.  
 Credit-default swaps on Pactiv debt lost 9.5 basis points
to 273.1 basis points, the lowest level since June 28, according
to data provider CMA. Earlier, the contracts fell 30 basis
points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The New York
Post reported Koch may make a bid for the Lake Forest, Illinois-
based company early next month, citing unidentified people close
to the matter.  
 Pactiv credit swaps soared 162 basis points to 300 basis
points on May 17 after reports that it was in talks to be bought
by Apollo Global Management LLC, the private-equity firm founded
by  Leon Black . Credit swaps on targets of private-equity
purchases typically rise because the firms historically have
borrowed two-thirds or more of the acquisition prices.  
 Pactiv rose $1.20, or 4.1 percent, to $30.85 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain since June 8.
The shares have gained  28 percent  this year.  
 Koch didn’t respond to calls seeking comment. Pactiv
declined to comment.  
 Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying security if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point, 0.01
percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.
