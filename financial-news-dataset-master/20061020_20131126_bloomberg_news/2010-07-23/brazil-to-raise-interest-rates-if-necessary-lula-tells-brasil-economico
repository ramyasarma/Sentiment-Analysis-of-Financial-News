             Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva said the country’s election campaign won’t deter the
central bank from raising interest rates to keep inflation in
check,  Brasil Economico  reported.  
 Lula said that an inflation rate of as much as 5 percent is
still “acceptable,” according to the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper. The president said he won’t neglect the fight against
inflation, Brasil Economico said.
