             India’s central bank must raise
borrowing costs to cool inflation, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh’s  top economic adviser said, four days before the next
monetary policy announcement.  
 “Given the persistent high inflation, we recommend
tightening of the monetary policy,”  Chakravarthy Rangarajan ,
chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said
at a press conference in New Delhi today.  
 Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  is under pressure to raise
interest rates on July 27 to tame prices in India, where three
in four people live on less than $2 a day. The benchmark
wholesale-price inflation rate has remained over 10 percent for
five straight months.  
 Subbarao has increased rates three times since mid-March by
a quarter-point each. The benchmark  reverse repurchase rate  is 4
percent and the repurchase rate is 5.5 percent.  
 India’s wholesale-price  inflation rate  rose 10.55 percent
in June after climbing to a 19-month high of 11.23 percent in
April.  
 Ten-year government bond yields were little changed at 7.67
percent at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai after climbing earlier today to
7.69 percent, their highest level in more than a month. The
Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index rose 0.1 percent.
