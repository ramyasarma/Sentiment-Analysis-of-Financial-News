             The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
rally to its June intra-day high of 1,131 once the gauge breaks
out of a so-called downtrend channel, according to technical
analysis by BGC Partners Inc.  
 The measure climbed 2.3 percent to 1,093.67 yesterday after
companies from AT&T Inc. to United Parcel Service Inc. increased
profit forecasts. “The market is inching closer to breaking out
of the much-revered downtrend channel, which would mark a shift
in positioning for U.S. equities to a more neutral stance,”
 Jamie Coutts , a technical analyst and sales manager at BGC in
Singapore, wrote in a note to clients today.  
 The  S&P 500 Index  has declined 10 percent from this year’s
closing high of 1,217.28 set on April 23 as Europe’s debt crisis
and faltering home sales and manufacturing in the U.S. added to
signs global economic growth is slowing down. Since reaching the
April high, the gauge has risen and fallen at least five times,
with each rally establishing a lower peak, according to
Bloomberg data. The decline in the past three months helped form
the current downtrend channel.  
 While the market is rallying on low trading volumes, Coutts
said the gauge may continue its advance if the immediate
resistance at 1,100 points is broken. “If the 1,100 point level
is broken then we could easily race another 3 percent to the
1,131 resistance level, which was the June high.”  
 Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. They
use trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
