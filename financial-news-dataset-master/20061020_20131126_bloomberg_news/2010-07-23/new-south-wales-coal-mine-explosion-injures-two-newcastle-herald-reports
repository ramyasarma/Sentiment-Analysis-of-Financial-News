             Emergency services were called to the
Drayton coal mine near Muswellbrook in Australia’s New South
Wales state after an explosion, the Newcastle Herald reported.
  Police said two workers suffered abdominal injuries, according
to the newspaper. Paramedics and a rescue helicopter were called
to the scene.
  The mine is operated by Anglo American Plc, whose Brisbane-
based spokesman Aldo Pennini couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.
 The mine produces about 5.5 million metric tons of power
station coal a year and employs about 300 workers, according to
Anglo American’s website.
