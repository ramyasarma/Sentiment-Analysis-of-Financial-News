             The British pound pared its advance
against the dollar and extended gains against the euro after the
European Central Bank said banks being stress tested were only
examined on European sovereign-debt losses for the bonds they
trade, rather than those held to maturity.  
 The pound traded 0.8 percent higher at $1.5379 at 2:25 p.m.
in London after advancing as much as 1.3 percent earlier.
Sterling strengthened 1.4 percent to 83.31 pence per euro.  
 “The haircuts are applied to the trading book portfolios
only, as no default assumption was considered,” according to a
confidential ECB draft document dated July 22 and titled “EU
Stress Test Exercise: Key Messages on Methodological Issues.”
