             America Movil SAB , Latin America’s
largest wireless carrier, said second-quarter profit fell 18
percent on foreign-exchange losses. Sales rose as client growth
accelerated for the second straight quarter.  
 Net income dropped to 18.7 billion pesos ($1.47 billion),
or 58 centavos a share, from 22.8 billion pesos, or 69 centavos,
a year earlier, Mexico City-based America Movil said yesterday
in a statement. Revenue climbed 12 percent to 101 billion pesos.  
 America Movil is adding text-messaging and Internet access
plans in Mexico, its largest and most profitable market, to lure
more subscribers. A million of the company’s 4.9 million new
customers in the quarter came from Mexico, outpaced only by
Brazil’s 1.3 million.  
 “Hats off to them,” said  Christopher King , an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore. “They’re managing costs
effectively there and continuing to grow subscribers.”  
 America Movil rose 1.10 pesos, or 3.5 percent, to 32.59
pesos yesterday in Mexico City trading before results were
announced. The shares have climbed 5.9 percent this  year .  
 Mexican data revenue grew 25 percent from a year earlier,
America Movil said, without disclosing the figure.  
 America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ,
recorded a foreign-exchange loss of 709 million pesos for the
quarter, compared with a gain of 5.39 billion pesos a year
earlier.  
 Subscriber Growth  
 Total mobile-phone subscribers rose to 211 million, up 11
percent from a year earlier. That compares with 10.6 percent
growth in the previous quarter and a 10 percent jump in the
fourth quarter. The 4.9 million new subscribers in the quarter
beat King’s estimate for 4.05 million. He advises buying the
shares.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or  Ebitda , were 42 billion pesos, up 9.4 percent
from a year earlier. That includes 21.3 billion pesos from the
Mexican unit, which had an Ebitda profit margin, or the
proportion of revenue left after manufacturing costs, of 59
percent. America Movil’s wireless market share in Mexico is
about 71 percent.  
 In Brazil, where America Movil and three competitors each
account for more than 20 percent of subscribers, the company’s
Ebitda margin was 26.3 percent. Brazil is America Movil’s
second-largest market with 25 percent of the country’s mobile-
phone customers.
