             Angola plans to improve its rules on
oil exploration and drilling in the waters off its coast in
light of the biggest oil spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of
Mexico, Angolan Oil Minister Jose Maria de Vasconcelos said.  
 “We don’t have any other choice,” he said in an interview
in Luanda today. “As an oil producting nation, we have to
continue making our security measures more and more refined.”  
 Angola vies with Nigeria as Africa’s largest oil producer.
