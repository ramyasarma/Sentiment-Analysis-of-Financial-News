             Gold futures fell for the first time
in four days after European regulators said seven of 91 banks
failed a financial stress test, eroding the value of the euro
against the dollar.  
 The European Union said the seven banks can’t survive
potential losses on sovereign-bond holdings. The euro dropped as
much as 0.8 percent against the greenback, reducing demand for
gold as an alternative to the U.S. currency. Gold has fallen 6.2
percent from a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “Gold is tentatively re-establishing its relationship to
the dollar,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “Gold is trying to track the
euro.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery dropped $7.80, or 0.7
percent, to $1,187.80 on the Comex in New York. The metal has
climbed 8.4 percent this year.  
 Gold traditionally has moved in tandem with the euro as an
alternative to the dollar. This year, some investors sold euros
and purchased dollars and gold amid Europe’s fiscal woes.  
 “Some of the risk premium has come out of the market, and
gold continues to struggle with the $1,200 level,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.  
 Silver futures for September delivery fell 1.9 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $18.101 an ounce. This week, silver gained 1.8
percent while gold was little changed.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $13.40, or 0.9
percent, to $1,542.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, up 2 percent this week.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $9.85, or
2.2 percent, to $466.75 an ounce, up 4 percent this week.
