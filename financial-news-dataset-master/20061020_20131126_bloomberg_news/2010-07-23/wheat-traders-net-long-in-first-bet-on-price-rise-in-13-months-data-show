             Wheat speculators and hedge funds
last week held  net-long positions , or bets prices will rise, for
the first time in more than a year on the Chicago Board of
Trade,  
 Long positions outnumbered wagers on falling prices by
2,335 contracts in the week ended July 20, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed today. Prices have jumped 24
percent this month as adverse weather threatened crops in Russia
and Canada, two of the world’s four biggest producers.  
 “The fundamentals changed weather-wise,” said  Jason Britt , president at Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas
City, Missouri. “The perception is that things are tightening
up.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.25 cent to
$5.9625 a bushel today on the CBOT. Yesterday, the price reached
$6.10, the highest level for a most-active contract since June
16, 2009.  
 The last time net-longs exceeded shorts was in June 2009.
