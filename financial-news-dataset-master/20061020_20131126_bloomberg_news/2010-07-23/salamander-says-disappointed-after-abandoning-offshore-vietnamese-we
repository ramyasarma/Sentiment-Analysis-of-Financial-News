             Salamander Energy Plc  abandoned a
well it drilled offshore southern Vietnam, terming the dry hole
a disappointment.  
 The well in Vietnam’s block 31 was plugged after being
drilled to a vertical depth of 2,103 meters “without
encountering significant hydrocarbons,” Salamander said in a
statement today to the London Stock Exchange.  
 Salamander has stakes in exploration areas in Vietnam’s
southern Mekong Delta and off the country’s southern and
northern coastlines. London-based Salamander, also operates in
Indonesia, Laos and Thailand.  
 “We expect some dry holes,” said Salamander Chief
Executive  James Menzies , in a statement. “Nevertheless, we are
disappointed that drilling in this frontier basin has not
offered more encouragement.”  
 Vietnam was Southeast Asia’s third-biggest  oil producer 
last year after Indonesia and Malaysia, producing about 345,000
barrels a day, according to BP Plc. All of Vietnam’s output
comes from areas off the country’s southern coast. Salamander
said in May that it plans to begin drilling next year in
northern Vietnam, hoping to open a new region to production.  
 Salamander  shares  yesterday gained 0.5 percent to 224
pence. For the year the company’s stock has declined 25 percent.
