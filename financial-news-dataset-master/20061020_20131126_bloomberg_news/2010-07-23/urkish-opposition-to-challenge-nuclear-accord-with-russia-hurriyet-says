             Turkey’s main opposition party will
ask the constitutional court to annul an agreement with Russia
on the construction of the country’s first nuclear power plant,
Hurriyet newspaper reported.  
 The Republican People’s Party will argue that the government
avoided a transparent tender process by concluding the deal in
the form of an international agreement between the two
countries, the Istanbul-based newspaper reported, citing
lawmaker Akif Hamzacebi.
