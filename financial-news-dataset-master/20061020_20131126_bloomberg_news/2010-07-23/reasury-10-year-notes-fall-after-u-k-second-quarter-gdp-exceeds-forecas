             U.S. Treasury 10-year notes fell
after a report showed the U.K. economy grew almost twice as much
as analysts forecast in the second quarter in the fastest
expansion in four years.  
 The yield on the note rose four basis points to 2.98
percent as of 9:35 a.m. in London.  
 U.K. gross domestic product rose 1.1 percent in the three
months through June after increasing 0.3 percent in the previous
quarter, the Office for National Statistics said in London
today. Economists forecast a 0.6 percent gain, according to the
median of 32 predictions in a Bloomberg survey.
