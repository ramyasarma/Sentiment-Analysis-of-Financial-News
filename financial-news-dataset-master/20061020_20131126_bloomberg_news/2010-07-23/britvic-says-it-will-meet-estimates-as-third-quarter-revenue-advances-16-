             Britvic Plc , the maker of Tango soda
and Robinson’s fruit drinks, said it’s “confident” of meeting
full-year analysts’ estimates after reporting increased fiscal
third-quarter sales.  
 Revenue climbed 16 percent to 289.5 million pounds ($442
million), the Chelmsford, England-based company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today. Sales for the year to
date rose 8.5 percent to 794.8 million pounds.  
 “We continue to remain cautious about consumer sentiment
in our trading territories, but as a result of our strong
performance in the quarter and in the year to date, the board
remains confident of meeting current market expectations for the
full 2010 financial year,” Chief Executive Officer  Paul Moody 
said in the statement.  
 Britvic acquired Fruité Entreprises SA, an independent
French soft drinks company, in May for 237 million euros ($306
million). It contributed revenue of 23.2 million pounds in June,
the company said today.
