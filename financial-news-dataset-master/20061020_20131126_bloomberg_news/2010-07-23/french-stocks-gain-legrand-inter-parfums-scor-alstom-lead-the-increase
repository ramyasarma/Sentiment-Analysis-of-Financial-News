             France’s CAC 40 Index climbed 0.2
percent to 3,607.05 at the 17:30 p.m. close in Paris, gaining 3
percent this week. The broader SBF 120 Index rose 0.2 percent to
2,679.24.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
French equity market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses
after company names.  
 Alstom SA  (ALO FP), the world’s third-largest power-
equipment maker, surged 3.7 percent to 38.55 euros. Alstom won
two contracts worth 450 million euros ($582.5 million) to
design, build, and maintain two combined-cycle gas units for an
Indian company.  
 European Aerospace Defence & Space Co.  (EAD FP) climbed
3.8 percent to 18.02 euros, rising for a third day. The
company’s Airbus SAS unit will probably return to profit this
year if it reaches an agreement with buyers of its A400M
military transport plane on compensation for higher-than-
expected development costs, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Enders.   
 Enders expects to sell at least 170 of the aircraft to
their seven customer governments, which will put the project on
an “acceptable economic footing,” the newspaper reported.  
 Legrand SA  (LR FP) climbed 1.9 percent to 25.69 euros, its
highest price since June 23. The French maker of electrical
switches and plugs made an offer to buy Indo Asian Fusegear
Ltd.’s switchgear division. The companies didn’t disclose the
size of the offer.  
 Scor SE  (SCR FP) surged 4.2 percent to 16.27 euros, rising
for the first time in more than a week. The French reinsurer
said premiums from property, casualty, and specialty treaty
renewals at the end of June grew 19 percent, before currency
changes.  
 Pernod-Richard SA  (RI FP) fell 2.3 percent to 62.61 euros,
erasing yesterday’s increase, as sales excluding revenue from
acquisitions advanced “close to 3 percent” in the fiscal
fourth quarter. That missed the average prediction of a 4.2
percent gain in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts. The shares
fell even as the maker of Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal whiskey
raised its full-year profit forecast for the second time this
year.  
 Sanofi Aventis SA  (SAN FP), France’s largest drugmaker fell
4.3 percent to 45.51 euros, its lowest price in almost a year.
U.S. regulators approved the first generic version of the
Lovenox anti-clotting drug, giving clearance to Novartis AG’s
copy.  
 STMicroelectronics NV  (STM FP), Europe’s largest
semiconductor maker, fell 3.6 percent to 6.50 euros, the second-
worst performer on the CAC 40 index. Shares fell as analysts
were disappointed by results at its wireless joint venture ST-
Ericsson, which posted a second-quarter net loss of $139 million
compared with a net loss of $213 million a year earlier.
 Alcatel-Lucent SA  (ALU FP), France’s largest telecommunications
equipment maker, fell 2.2 percent to 2.08 euros, paring
yesterday’s gain.  
 Societe Television Francaise  (TFI FP) surged 6.4 percent to
12.45 euros, its highest level in over a month. The owner of
France’s most-watched television channel said first-half profit
rose by 51 percent and increased its full-year revenue guidance
as advertising sales rose.
