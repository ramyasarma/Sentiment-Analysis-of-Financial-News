Empreendimentos e Participacoes , Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by
revenue, rose to the highest price in five months in Sao Paulo
trading after reporting a 77 percent gain in sales.  
 Shares advanced 2.4 percent to 23.10 reais, the highest
level since Feb. 24.  
 Cyrela said in a regulatory filing last night that second-
quarter preliminary contracted sales reached 1.5 billion reais
($851.7 million). The company’s exclusive stake of the sales was
1.1 billion reais, 77 percent higher than the same period last
year, the filing said.  
 “The numbers reported today were slightly better than
estimated,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts  Adrian E. Huerta  and
 Marcelo Motta  wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday.
“Sales were strong.”
