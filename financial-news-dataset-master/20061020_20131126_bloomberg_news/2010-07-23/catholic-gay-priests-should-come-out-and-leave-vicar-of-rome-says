             The Vicar of Rome today called on
homosexual clergymen in the Catholic Church to “come out” and
leave the priesthood.  
 The Vicar of Rome, one of the most important positions in
the Vatican, was responding to a report today in Panorama
Magazine that said Catholic priests were conducting a double
life, citing secret video footage.  
 “No one is forcing them to stay in the priesthood to
exploit the benefits,” the Diocese of Rome said in a statement
posted on its Web Site. “If they are coherent, they should come
out into the open.”
