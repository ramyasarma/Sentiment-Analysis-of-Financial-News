             Anglo American Plc, which operates
six coal mines in Australia, stopped operations at Drayton in
New South Wales for a “short period” after an accident
hospitalized four workers.  
 Mining was stopped “in order to brief employees on the
incident,” which occurred at 8:15 a.m. local time, Brisbane-
based spokesman  Aldo Pennini  said in an e-mailed response to
questions. Operations have since resumed.  
 Drayton, 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the export port of
Newcastle, produces about 5.5 million metric tons of power-
station coal a year and employs about 300 workers, according to
Anglo American’s website. Five employees were affected by an
incident during blasting, the company said in a separate
statement.  
 Of the four treated at hospital, one has been discharged
and the fifth employee has returned to work, Anglo American said.
The company is treating the incident “very seriously” and
cooperating with all relevant authorities.
