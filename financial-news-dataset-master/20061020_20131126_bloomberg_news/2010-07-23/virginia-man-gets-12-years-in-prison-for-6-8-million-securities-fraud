             A Virginia man was sentenced to 12
years and 7 months in prison for operating a scheme that
defrauded $6.8 million from clients who gave him money to invest
in blue chip stocks, prosecutors said.  
 Gregory Vincent Cronin, who operated Innovative Investment
Advisors Inc., was also ordered to pay $6.9 million in
restitution. He pleaded guilty to mail fraud and securities
fraud.  
 “He lied to his victims, and now everything they had is
gone,”  Neil MacBride , the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern
District of Virginia, said in a statement. “The financial and
emotional devastation left in his wake will be extremely
difficult to rebuild, all because of one man’s greed.”  
 Cronin, 49, told his clients their investments in blue chip
stocks were doing well, while actually depositing money into an
account be used to buy and sell stock index options, losing
money. When clients sought to have money returned, he would use
a later investor’s money to make the repayment.  
 The case is U.S. v. Cronin, 10cr154, U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).
