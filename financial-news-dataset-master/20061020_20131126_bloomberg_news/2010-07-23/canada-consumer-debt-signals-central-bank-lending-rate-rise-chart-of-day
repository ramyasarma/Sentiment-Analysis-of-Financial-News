             Canadians are getting deeper into
debt, fueling spending and increasing pressure on the Bank of
Canada to raise interest rates even as growth slows.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the ratio of household debt
to disposable income in Canada is nearing U.S. levels, according
to data from Statistics Canada, the Federal Reserve and the
Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Canadian ratio rose to 1.46 in
the first quarter from 1.09 in 2000. In the U.S., the ratio fell
to 1.53 from a peak of 1.66 in 2008.  
 “That has to be a concern to a central banker when you see
that kind of debt growth,” said  Derek Holt , a Toronto-based
economist at  Bank of Nova Scotia’s  Scotia Capital unit. “Those
who are assuming the bank can’t possibly get a sizeable jump on
the Fed I think are ignoring the fact that the monetary policy
cycles in both countries are fundamentally different.”  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney , who raised his key
interest rate for a second month to 0.75 percent on July 20,
yesterday said the levels of indebtedness in the two countries
are starting to “cross over” and he urged Canadians to
consider their capacity to service debts as interest rates rise.  
 “Debt can’t grow to the sky,” Carney said. “Rates are
extraordinarily low. That won’t always be the case, and people
and financial institutions should manage their affairs such that
individuals can carry debt at more normal costs of interest.”  
 The central bank on July 20 trimmed its Canada growth
forecast for this year to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent.
