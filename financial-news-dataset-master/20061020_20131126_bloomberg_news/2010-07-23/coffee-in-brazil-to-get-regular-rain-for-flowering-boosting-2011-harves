             Coffee crops in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, are expected to get regular rainfall in the
September flowering period, helping diminish a cyclical decline
in production next year, a government forecaster said.  
 Showers in the Center West and Southeast regions are
forecast to start in the second half of September, the best time
for rain to stimulate the flowering of coffee trees, said
Expedito Rebello, head of research at the government’s
Meteorology Institute, known as Inmet.  
 “Coffee beans may improve flowering as rains tend to be
more regular,” Rebello said yesterday in a telephone interview
from Brasilia. “The weather is very favorable for coffee.”  
 Excess rainfall last year prompted trees to flower at
different times, before or after the adequate period, Rebello
said. La Nina, as the cyclical cooling of the equatorial Pacific
waters is known, will reduce rain in Brazil’s largest coffee
producing regions and allow better flowering this year, Rebello
said.  
 Output will rise this year, even after the irregular
flowering, because trees entered the better-yielding half of a
two-year cycle. Brazil will harvest 47 million 60-kilogram (132-
pound) coffee bags this year, up from 39.5 million bags last
year, the Agriculture Ministry said on May 6.  
 The ministry will release its first estimate for next
year’s April-September harvest on Jan. 6.  
 Less rainfall than last year in the South of Brazil, the
country’s second-biggest soybean-producing region, will also
help planting of the oilseed starting in October, Rebello said.
