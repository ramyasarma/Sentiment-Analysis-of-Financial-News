             Sugar rose to a four-month high in
New York and London, as a report on potential purchases by
Pakistan signaled demand remains robust in a deficit market.  
 The South Asian nation may need to import as much as
700,000 metric tons of white sugar by September, according to an
industry trade group. Pakistanis consume 350,000 tons of sugar
each month, climbing by 30,000 tons during the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan, which starts around August.  
 “The government will have to urgently import before stocks
run out,” Iskander Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Sugar Mills
Association, said by phone from Islamabad. Current inventories
of 800,000 tons will last only until September, he said.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery advanced as much as 2
percent to 18.66 cents a pound, the highest intraday price since
March 22, on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The contract was at
18.58 cents at 8 a.m. local time.  
 White, or refined, sugar for October delivery added as much
as $11.30, or 2 percent, to $571 a ton, the highest price since
March 9, on the Liffe exchange in London. The contract recently
traded at $566, up 8.8 percent this week and headed for a fourth
straight weekly gain, the longest run since the week ended Jan.
11, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  
 The October contract is at a premium of more than $50 to
December-delivery sugar, a so-called backwardation that may
signal limited supplies.  
 Brazilian Ports  
 Prices have also gained this week on delays at ports in
Brazil, the world’s biggest sugar producer and exporter. The
number of ships waiting at ports rose to 113,  Naim Beydoun  of
Rolle, Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar Brokers said today in an e-
mailed note.  
 “There is demand for sugar, and there is a big impact from
the port bottlenecks in Brazil,” he said by phone.  
 A surplus in the year starting Oct. 1 is “unlikely to be
sufficient to rebuild supply pipelines,” Czarnikow Group Ltd.
said in a report last month. Two years of shortfalls reduced
stockpiles by 27 million tons, the broker said.  
 On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, September-delivery cocoa
rose $6, or 0.2 percent, to $2,922 a ton. Cocoa for September
delivery slid 13 pounds, or 0.6 percent, to 2,260 pounds
($3,483) a ton on Liffe. The drop was the fifth in a row, the
longest run of declines since April.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery traded on ICE
Futures rose 0.2 percent to $1.62 a pound. Robusta coffee for
September delivery gained $12, or 0.7 percent, to $1,703 a ton.
