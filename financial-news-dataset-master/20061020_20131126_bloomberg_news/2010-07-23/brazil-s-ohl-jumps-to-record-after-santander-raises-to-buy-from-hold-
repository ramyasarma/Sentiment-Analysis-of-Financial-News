             Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA , a
Brazilian toll-road operator, rose to a record in Sao Paulo
trading after Banco Santander SA recommended buying the stock.  
 OHL gained 3.4 percent, the most in two months, to 45.20
reais as Brazil’s benchmark equity index climbed 0.9 percent.  
 Brazil’s growing industrial production “is a key driver of
traffic volume on the highways under OHL concession,” boosting
earnings, analyst  Caio Dias  wrote in a note to clients today.
Santander raised its rating from “hold” and forecast the
shares to reach 58 reais at end-2011. The stock is cheap
compared with local and international peers, Santander said.  
 OHL trades at 13.6 times reported earnings compared with
the Bovespa index’s ratio of 14.6, according to Bloomberg data.
