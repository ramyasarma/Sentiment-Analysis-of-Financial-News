             Horsehead Holding Corp. , a U.S. zinc
producer, has suffered an explosion at a smelter in western
Pennsylvania that killed two workers and injured one, Associated
Press reported, citing authorities.  
 The explosion, which occurred around 4:30 p.m. yesterday
local time, involved a refinery column that produces zinc oxide,
Horsehead spokesman  Ali Alavi  was quoted as saying. It didn’t
say how production at the smelter had been affected.  
 After-hours calls to Horsehead’s Pittsburgh headquarters by
Bloomberg News were unanswered today.  
 The facility in Monaca, 30 miles north of Pittsburgh, has
about 600 employees, Alavi was quoted as saying. Investigations
are under way to determine the cause of the explosion, he said,
adding his understanding was that there was no fire.  
 Horsehead’s shares  closed 42 cents, or 5.5 percent, higher
at $8.09 yesterday, valuing the company at $351 million.  
 The Monaca plant operates as the country’s largest zinc
smelter, producing primarily metal and oxide, according to its
 website . The facility is recognized as the world’s largest user
of recycled zinc-bearing materials, it said.  
 The company was formed in 2003 from New Jersey Zinc Co. and
St. Joe Resources Co., the website said.
