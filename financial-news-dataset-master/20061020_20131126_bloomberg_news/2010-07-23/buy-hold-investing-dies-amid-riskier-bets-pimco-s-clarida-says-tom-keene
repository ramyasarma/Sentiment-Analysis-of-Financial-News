             Making money while investing
requires riskier bets as the days of buy and hold disappear,
according to  Richard Clarida , a global strategic adviser at
Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 “In the new normal environment, you have to be nimble and
tactical,” Clarida said today in a radio interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Surveillance.  
 Successful strategies will center on investors’ ability to
anticipate extreme outcomes after the end of the “great
moderation,” a period of stability, Clarida wrote in a July 21
article on the  Web site  of Newport Beach, California-based
Pimco, which manages $1.1 trillion.  
 The great moderation, an era from 1987 to 2007 of
“predictable policy, low inflation, and modest business
cycles,” allowed investors to make money using debt to magnify
profits on bets that actual outcomes would match the average of
a range of possibilities, Clarida wrote.  
 Following the financial crisis and its aftermath,
historical correlations are probably irrelevant or misleading,
Clarida said. Investors have less confidence the distribution of
events they anticipate is correct.  
 With more returns or losses tied to “tails,” or extreme
events, and less on the average, money managers will probably
adjust their portfolios more often, creating “risk-on” and
“risk-off” trading days, he said.  
 “You don’t want to get married to your investment thesis
or get married to your positions,” Clarida said.  
 By being “very tactical and flexible” about the way it
allocated assets across the global economy, Clarida said, Pimco
achieved high returns this year.  
 Pimco’s $234 billion Total Return Fund, the world’s largest
mutual fund, handed investors a 13 percent gain in the past
year, beating 63 percent of its competitors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
