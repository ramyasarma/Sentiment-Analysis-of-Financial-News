             ERG SpA , Italy’s second-largest oil
refiner, had a fire at its Priolo South  refinery  yesterday
afternoon because of a fuel gas leak in a secondary pipeline.  
 Production at the plant was unaffected, a refinery official
said today by phone, declining to be identified in line with
company policy. There were no injuries and ERG was able to
maintain output using its primary pipeline, he said.  
 The refinery in Sicily has the capacity to process 238,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Eni SpA is Italy’s largest refiner.
