             European Union carbon permits
advanced to a three-day high as natural gas prices increased,
stimulating demand for pollution allowances.  
 EU permits for December rose as much as 0.5 percent to
14.32 euros ($18.42) a metric ton, the highest level since July
20. They were at 14.27 euros at 8:42 a.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange, a gain of 0.1 percent this week.  
 The EU emissions trading system, started in 2005 to help
fight climate change, is the world’s largest cap-and-trade
program, covering about 12,000 installations.  
 U.K. natural gas for delivery next month gained as much as
3.1 percent to 43 pence a therm. Higher gas prices may prompt
some power utilities to burn more coal, which requires about
twice as many carbon permits to use.
