             Safaricom Ltd.  Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Joseph  said he will act as a “strategic
advisor” after his Nov. 1 retirement.  
 Joseph, 64, yesterday announced that he will be replaced by
 Bob Collymore , 52, at the helm of East Africa’s biggest company
by market value. He will remain on the board of directors of the
Nairobi-based company to advise the new CEO and to help expand
the company’s mobile cash transfer business, known as MPESA.  
 “My mandate for the next two years is, one, to be
strategic advisor to Bob in particular,” he said. “Another
part of my mandate is to expand MPESA internationally”.  
 Joseph has run the company since it was founded in 2000. It
is 40 percent owned by Vodafone Group.  He will also act as an
adviser to Johannesburg-based Vodacom Group Ltd., which is
controlled by Vodafone, with respect to its businesses in
Mozambique, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Lesotho, he said.  
 Safaricom shares fell 5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 5.65
shillings as of 9:56 a.m. Nairobi time, giving the company a
market value of 226 billion shillings ($2.8 billion).
