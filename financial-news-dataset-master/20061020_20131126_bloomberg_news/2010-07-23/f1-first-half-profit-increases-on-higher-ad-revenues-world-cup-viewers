             Societe Television Francaise 1 , the
owner of France’s most-watched TV channel, said first-half
profit rose by 51 percent and the company increased its full-
year revenue guidance as advertising sales rose.  
 Net income climbed to 74 million euros ($95 million) from
49 million euros a year earlier, TF1 said in an e-mailed
statement. Sales rose 14 percent to 1.29 billion euros from
1.13 billion euros a year earlier. The company raised its full-
year revenue forecast, saying sales would rise 7 percent to
2.53 billion euros.  
 TF1 is looking to guard market share and build its online
presence as French consumers watch more television on computers
and mobile devices. In June the company extended its
Eurosportbet online gambling service to France, taking
advantage of new laws permitting Internet betting under certain
conditions.  
 “The TF1 channel retained its unrivalled position,” the
company said in the statement. TF1 also attracted its highest
audience since the start of the year as 15.2 million people
tuned in for a June 17 France-Mexico soccer match, the company
said.  
 Still, TF1’s 20 percent target ratio of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is “no longer
viable given changes in economic conditions,” the company
said.
