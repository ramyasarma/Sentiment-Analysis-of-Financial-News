             German banks proved to be robust and
resilient in Europe-wide stress tests, Bundesbank and the
country’s financial regulator BaFin said.  
 “The German banking system has shown itself to be robust
and proved its resilience even under very pessimistic
assumptions,” the Frankfurt-based central bank and BaFin said
in a joint press release. German banks’ solvency is “assured”
even in a scenario of a “sharp decline in growth and shifts in
the yield curve.”  
 The stress tests assume a cumulative economic slowdown in
the euro area of 3.0 percentage points for 2010 and 2011, with
German output to drop by as much as 3.3 percentage points this
year and next compared to the benchmark scenario, Bundesbank and
BaFin said.   
 Hypo Real Estate Holding AG is the only one of 14 German
bank to fail the test, the report said.  
 “The stress test figures are profound, they are reliable,
one shouldn’t again speak badly of them,” BaFin President
Jochen Sanio said at a press conference in Frankfurt today.  
 “I’m full of confidence that trust in the markets will
increase due to the stress test,” Bundesbank President Franz-
Christoph Zeitler said. “We see some improvement on money and
capital markets and also a recovery in peripheral countries.”
