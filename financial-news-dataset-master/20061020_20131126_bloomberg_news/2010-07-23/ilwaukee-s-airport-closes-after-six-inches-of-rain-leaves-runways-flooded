             Milwaukee’s  General Mitchell
International Airport  is closed until at least noon local time
today because of flooding after  almost 6 inches of rain  fell
overnight.  
 The airport has been closed since 9:30 p.m. yesterday, when
 portions of the runways  began to flood, said Ryan McAdams, a
spokesman for the airport. As much as 4 more inches of rain are
forecast today, he said.  
 Milwaukee has about 235 departures a day, and its biggest
carriers are  Republic Airways Holdings Inc. ’s Frontier unit,
 AirTran Holdings Inc.  and  Delta Air Lines Inc. , McAdams said.  
 AirTran canceled all 39 of its scheduled departures at
Milwaukee today and diverted 8 flights to nearby airports last
night, said  Christopher White , a spokesman for the carrier.  
 “It’s been raining pretty much constantly since last
night, and the ground was already saturated so all this water is
just sitting there and can’t absorb,” McAdams said.  
 The airport’s drainage system is working and the water is
starting to recede in some areas, he said. Once the flooding
dissipates, crews will need to clear branches and grass
clippings and other debris, and inspect lights and electrical
systems before flights can resume.  
 Milwaukee is the 49th-busiest airport in North America,
with 7.9 million passengers last year, according to the Airports
Council International trade group.
