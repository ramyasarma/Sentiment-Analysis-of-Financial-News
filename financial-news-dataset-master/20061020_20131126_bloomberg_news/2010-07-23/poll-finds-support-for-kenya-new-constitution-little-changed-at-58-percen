             Support for Kenya’s draft
constitution is almost unchanged from about two months ago, with
58 percent of registered voters saying they will vote in favor,
according to a poll by market research company  Synovate .  
 The company surveyed 6,005 people from July 11 to July 17,
Tom Wolf, head of research for Synovate, told reporters in the
capital, Nairobi, today. About 22 percent said they will reject
the constitution, while the rest are undecided or won’t vote, he
said. The margin of error was 1.6 percentage points.  
 Kenyans will vote on Aug. 4 on the new constitution that
aims to limit presidential powers and narrow ethnic divisions
that were at the heart of post-election violence in 2008. The
results of Synovate’s poll are almost unchanged from its
previous survey, published on June 4, which showed 57 percent
favored the proposed charter, while 20 percent were opposed.  
 The new charter is the centerpiece of the power-sharing
accord that ended clashes in which an estimated 1,500 people
died following disputed elections in December 2007.
