             General Electric Co.  raised a
dividend sooner than it had predicted and restarted a stock
buyback program, signaling that its finance and industrial units
are generating cash to reward investors. The shares climbed.  
 GE increased the quarterly payout 20 percent to 12 cents a
share from 10 cents, according to a statement today. The
dividend will be paid Oct. 25 to shareholders of record on Sept.
20. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company also plans to begin
repurchasing shares this quarter and extend the program through
2013 from the end of this year.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  and his board are
tapping into cash stockpiles they began building in 2008 as the
financial crisis deepened. Immelt said today’s move doesn’t
preclude other uses for funds, including acquisitions, as he
seeks to bolster profit growth next year.  
 “This may be the most capitally-efficient way for GE to
enhance its share price during a period of extensive market
uncertainty,” said  Nick Heymann , a Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.
analyst in New York with a “neutral” rating on the stock.  
 GE said July 16 that it expects to have $25 billion in cash
at the parent company level by year-end.  
 Shares Rally  
 GE rose 50 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $15.71 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the steepest gain
since July 7. The shares have advanced 3.8 percent this year,
bringing GE’s market value to $167.7 billion.  
 The company can buy back $11.6 billion of shares under the
existing repurchase plan. It had 10.7 billion shares outstanding
as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 GE’s industrial divisions include the world’s biggest
makers of jet engines, locomotives, power-plant turbines and
medical imaging and information technology equipment.  
 Total equipment orders rose 17 percent in the second
quarter while the backlog held steady at $172 billion, GE said
last week. The company is also shrinking its finance division to
account for 30 percent of profit, down from about half in 2007,
lessening the impact of market turbulence.  
 “We are able to restore the GE dividend at a historical
payout level for 2010 earlier than previously anticipated and to
extend our share buyback program because of continued strong
cash generation, recovery at GE Capital, and solid underlying
 performance  in our industrial businesses through the first half
of 2010,” Immelt said in today’s statement.  
 The company cut its dividend in February 2009 to 10 cents a
share from 31 cents, the first reduction since the Great
Depression. Immelt said in May he planned to raise the dividend
and increase buybacks by 2011.  
 At the time, Bloomberg  estimates  showed a payout of 12
cents a share, up from 10 cents.
