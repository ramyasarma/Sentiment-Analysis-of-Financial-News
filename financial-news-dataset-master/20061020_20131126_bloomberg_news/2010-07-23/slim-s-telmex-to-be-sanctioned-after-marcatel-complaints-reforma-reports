             Telefonos de Mexico SAB  will be
sanctioned by Mexico’s Ministry of Communications and
Transportation for causing cuts, interruptions and interferences
to Marcatel SA, Reforma reported, citing a statement from
Marcatel.  
 Marcatel, a closely held Mexican telecommunications
company, has lodged complaints with regulators and judicial
authorities about Telmex, its employees and owner Carlos Slim,
for almost two years, the Mexico City-based daily newspaper
said.   
 Telmex officials in Mexico City weren’t immediately
reachable outside regular working hours when Bloomberg News
called for comment.
