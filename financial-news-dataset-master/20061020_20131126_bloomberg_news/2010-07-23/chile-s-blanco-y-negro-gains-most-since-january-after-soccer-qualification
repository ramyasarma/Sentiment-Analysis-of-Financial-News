             Blanco y Negro SA , the owner of
Chile’s most popular soccer team, rose the most in six months
after qualifying for two Latin American club tournaments.  
 Blanco y Negro climbed 4 percent to 210 pesos at 11:59 a.m.
New York time, the steepest intraday advance since Jan. 15.
Chile’s  IPSA index  gained 0.2 percent.  
 Blanco y Negro’s Colo-Colo club secured a place in the
 Libertadores Cup  after Universidad de Chile’s draw yesterday
left Colo-Colo leading the domestic competition with a game in
hand, Agence France-Press reported. The result also gave Colo-
Colo a spot in the Sudamericana Cup that starts next month.  
 Azul Azul SA , the owner of Universidad de Chile’s soccer
club, was unchanged at 475 pesos.
