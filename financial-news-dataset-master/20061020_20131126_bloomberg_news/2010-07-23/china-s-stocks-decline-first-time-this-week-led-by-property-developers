             China’s stocks fell for the first
time this week on concern the slump in the property market may
worsen as the economy slows.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.4 percent to
2,553.34 at 1:42 p.m. local time. A gauge of developers slid 0.7
percent.  
 China’s property prices may drop as much as 30 percent and
economic growth will slow below 8 percent following government
measures to cool the real-estate market, according to Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc.  
 Gemdale Corp. lost 2.5 percent to 6.68 yuan.
