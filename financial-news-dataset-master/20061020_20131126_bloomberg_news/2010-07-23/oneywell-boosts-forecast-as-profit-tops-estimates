             Honeywell International Inc. , the
maker of car turbochargers and gas detectors, boosted its full-
year profit forecast after second-quarter earnings topped
analysts’ estimates.  
 Profit  will be  as much as $2.50 a share this year, the
Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement. Honeywell’s previous projection was at most $2.45.
Analysts had predicted $2.48 in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The increase in  earnings  was the first in six quarters as
demand for turbochargers rose. Chief Executive Officer  David Cote  said in the statement he remains cautious on the near-term
outlook because of ongoing economic uncertainties.  
 “We believe the recovery is happening,” Cote said on a
conference call with analysts and investors. “Our early-cycle
businesses are seeing the biggest improvement year over year,
such as turbo, sensing and control, scanning and mobility, field
instruments, gas detection and safety products.”  
 Honeywell rose 58 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $43.24 at 10:04
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares
had gained 8.8 percent this year before today.  
 Net income climbed 4 percent to $468 million, or 60 cents a
share, from $450 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Analysts, on average,  estimated  57 cents a share.
Sales increased 7.9 percent to $8.16 billion.  
 Honeywell also boosted its 2010 revenue forecast to $32.4
billion to $32.9 billion, from an April outlook of $31.5 billion
to $32.3 billion.
