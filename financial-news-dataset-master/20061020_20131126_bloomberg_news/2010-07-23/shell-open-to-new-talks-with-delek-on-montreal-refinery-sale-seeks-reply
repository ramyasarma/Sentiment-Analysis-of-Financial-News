             Royal Dutch Shell Plc  said it has
asked  Delek U.S. Holdings Inc.  to restart negotiations on the
sale of a Montreal refinery that Europe’s biggest oil company
had planned to convert to a fuel depot.  
 Shell has given Delek, the U.S. affiliate of Tel Aviv-based
Delek Group Ltd., 48 hours to respond to its offer of renewed
negotiations. The offer was made yesterday afternoon, Shell said
in an e-mailed statement.  
 A Quebec judge ordered Shell to stop conversion of the
refinery to a fuel terminal July 7, after the company said last
month it failed to find a buyer. It had been trying to sell the
asset for a year.  
 The company is now willing to sell the refinery at Delek’s
purchase price if the deal can be closed quickly enough to keep
the refinery running, Shell Vice President Richard Oblath told a
Canadian government committee.  
 Delek spokesman  Noel Ryan  declined comment on the proposal.
A company official told the Canadian government July 20 the
company is still interested in the refinery.  
 The plant can process about 130,000 barrels a day.  Delek
U.S. , based in Brentwood, Tennessee, runs a refinery in Texas
with a capacity of 60,000 barrels a day and about 400 gas
stations, according to its website.
