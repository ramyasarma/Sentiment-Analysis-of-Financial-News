             Kosovo prosecutors arrested central
bank Governor  Hashim Rexhepi  after raids on his office and home
in a corruption investigation.  
 Police officers from the Special Prosecutor Office’s anti-
corruption unit searched the residences of four suspects,
including Rexhepi, central bank offices and a private company in
Pristina, the European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo, also
known as EULEX, said today in a statement.  
 “Central bank Governor Hashim Rexhepi was arrested today
in the capital, Pristina, on suspicion of corruption and other
charges,” Euxlex spokeswoman Karin Limdal said by phone.  
 Rexhepi was appointed to a five-year term in March 2008.
The central bank’s management and governing board met today to
review the situation and “undertook all necessary steps” to
ensure continuity of operations, the bank said in a statement.  
 The searches were part of a “corruption and financial
investigation into suspicion of abusing official position or
authority, accepting bribes, tax evasion, trading in influence
and money laundering,” according to the statement.  
 The raids came one day after the International Court of
Justice, the United Nations’ highest court, said Kosovo’s 2008
declaration of independence from Serbia was legal.  
 Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian, unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia
almost nine years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
drove out the Serb army under leader  Slobodan Milosevic .
