             McDonald’s Corp. , the world’s
largest restaurant chain, posted a 12 percent gain in second-
quarter profit after attracting more customers with its frappes
and smoothies.  
 Net income rose to $1.23 billion, or $1.13 a share, Oak
Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said today in a statement. That
compared with the $1.12 average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Sales increased 5.3 percent to $5.95 billion, bolstered by
sales of frozen drinks in the three months ended in June, the
hottest on record, according to U.S. government data. The
restaurant chain, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jim Skinner ,
has added smoothies and other products to lure consumers into
its locations outside regular meal times.  
 “There’s not a ton of competition out there for
McDonald’s,” Janney Montgomery Scott LLC analyst  Mark Kalinowski  said in a telephone interview before the results came
out. “None of the other burger chains have the beverage
platform that McDonald’s does.”  
 McDonald’s may introduce new Angus snack wraps, hot oatmeal
and frozen lemonade in the next year, the New York-based analyst
said. He  recommends  that investors buy the shares.  
 McDonald’s dropped 39 cents to $71.01 at 9:37 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Before today, the  shares 
had climbed 14 percent this year, compared with a 1.9 percent
decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 In Line  
 “The report itself is in line with expectations,”  Matt DiFrisco , an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said in
an interview. “But the stock was hitting up against a 52-week
 high . I don’t see anything in this release that raises its
outlook dramatically.”  
 The chain’s sales at stores open more than 13 months
increased 4.8 percent globally. They rose 3.7 percent in the
U.S., 5.2 percent in Europe and 4.6 percent in Asia, the Middle
East and Africa.  
 The company said foreign currency fluctuations didn’t have
a net impact on profit in the quarter. The weakening euro cut 5
percentage points from  operating income  in McDonald’s European
business. Strengthening currencies in the chain’s Asia, Middle
East, and Africa markets countered that, boosting McDonald’s
earnings 10 percentage points.
