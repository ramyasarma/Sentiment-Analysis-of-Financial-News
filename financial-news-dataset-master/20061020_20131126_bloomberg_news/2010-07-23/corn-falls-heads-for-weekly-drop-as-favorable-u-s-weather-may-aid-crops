             Corn fell, capping the first weekly
drop this month, on speculation that rain and mild temperatures
in the next two weeks will improve crop development in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter.  
 Precipitation in parts of the eastern Midwest and South
will relieve dry areas, said  Allen Motew , a meteorologist at QT
Weather in Chicago. The National Weather Service’s 30-day
outlook for next month does not show any sustained hot, dry
conditions, Motew said.  
 “The forecasts look very favorable for big crops this
year,” said  Alan Kluis , the president of Northland Commodities
LLC in Minneapolis. “The market appears to have made a pre-
harvest top this week.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.845 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Most-
active contract fell 5.6 percent this week, snapping a three-
week rally of 13 percent.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
