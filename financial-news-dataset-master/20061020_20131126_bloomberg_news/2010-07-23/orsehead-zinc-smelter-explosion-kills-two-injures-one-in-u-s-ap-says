             Horsehead Holding Corp. , a U.S. zinc
producer, had an explosion at a smelter in western Pennsylvania
that killed two workers and injured at least one, Associated
Press reported, citing authorities.  
 The explosion, which occurred around 4:30 p.m. yesterday
local time, involved a refinery column that produces zinc oxide,
Horsehead spokesman  Ali Alavi  was quoted as saying. The report
didn’t say how production at the smelter had been affected.  
 After-hours calls to the switchboard of Horsehead’s
Pittsburgh headquarters by Bloomberg News were unanswered today.
Messages left on the phone of Alavi weren’t returned.  
 Horsehead’s zinc production in the three months to March 31
climbed 29 percent to 30,791 tons from the year before, with net
sales increasing 144 percent to $97 million, according to its
website. Second-quarter figures will be announced Aug. 9.  
 The facility in Monaca, 30 miles north of Pittsburgh, has
about 600 employees, Alavi was quoted as saying. Investigations
are under way to determine the cause of the blast, he said,
adding his understanding was that there was no fire.  
 Horsehead’s shares  closed 42 cents, or 5.5 percent, higher
at $8.09 yesterday, valuing the company at $351 million.  
 The Monaca plant operates as the country’s largest zinc
smelter, producing primarily metal and oxide, according to its
 website . The facility is recognized as the world’s biggest user
of recycled zinc-bearing materials, it said.  
 The company was formed in 2003 from New Jersey Zinc Co. and
St. Joe Resources Co., the website said.
