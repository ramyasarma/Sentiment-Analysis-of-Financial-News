             Moody’s Investors Service said it
placed Hungary’s credit rating on review for a possible
downgrade after the government was unable to reach agreement
with international donors on fiscal targets.  
 Moody’s placed Hungary’s Baa1 local and foreign currency
government bond ratings on review for possible downgrade, it
said in a statement today.  
 “Moody’s decision to initiate this review was prompted by
the increased uncertainty regarding Hungary’s fiscal outlook and
economic prospects,” it said in the statement. “This
uncertainty is the result of the recent breakdown of Hungary’s
talks with the IMF and EU.”
