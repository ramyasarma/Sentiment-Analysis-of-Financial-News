             German stocks climbed for a third
day ahead of the results of stress tests on European banks,
while net income from  Adidas AG  beat estimates and a survey
showed business confidence unexpectedly surged.  
 Adidas  rose 2.1 percent after reporting a gain in profit
that exceeded estimates on soccer’s World Cup.  BASF SE  and  Linde
AG  advanced after Akzo Nobel NV’s second-quarter profit beat
analysts’ forecasts.  
 The benchmark  DAX Index  increased 0.3 percent to 6,161.2 at
4:57 p.m. in Frankfurt, bringing its rally this week to 2
percent. The measure has fallen 2.7 percent from this year’s
high on April 26 amid concern the global economic recovery is
losing steam as indebted European governments slash spending and
China takes steps to cool its economy. The broader  HDAX  Index
rose 0.3 percent to 3,117.05.  
 “Stress tests are better than no stress tests,”  Torsten Martens , senior portfolio manager at MEAG Munich Ergo Asset
Management, said on Bloomberg Television this morning. “I hope
we will get more detail this evening, but I’m not sure about
it.”  
 The tests will establish whether European banks have enough
capital, defined as a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6
percent, to withstand a recession and a sovereign-debt crisis,
according to a document from the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors. Lenders that fail the tests will have to raise
additional capital. CEBS and national regulators will publish
the results from 6 p.m. Brussels time today.  
 Business Climate  
 The  Ifo institute  said its  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, jumped to 106.2, its highest level
since July 2007, from 101.8 in June. That’s the biggest monthly
increase since records for a reunified Germany began in 1990.
Economists expected a decline to 101.5, according to the median
of 41 analysts’ forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Adidas, the world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker,
jumped 2.1 percent to 42.54 euros after saying net income
increased to 126 million euros ($161.5 million), compared with 9
million euros a year earlier. That beat the 70.9 million-euro
average estimate of four analysts. Revenue rose 19 percent to
2.9 billion euros.  
 Deutsche Lufthansa A G, Europe’s second-largest airline,
advanced 2.3 percent to 12.46 euros, its highest price in a
week, ahead of next week’s earnings announcement.  
 BASF, the world’s biggest chemical company, gained 1.5
percent to 46.66 euros. Akzo Nobel, the biggest paint maker,
said second-quarter net income attributable to shareholders rose
to 273 million euros from 155 million euros a year earlier,
beating the average estimate of 190 million euros from 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Linde , the Munich-based gases company, climbed 1.2 percent
to 89.87 euros. European chemicals shares in the Stoxx 600 Index
rallied 0.9 percent.
