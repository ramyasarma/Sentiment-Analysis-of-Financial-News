             European Union regulators found Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d., Slovenia’s largest financial services
company, has sufficient capital to withstand a recession and a
sovereign crisis.  
 The lender’s tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, would drop to 6.3 percent by the end of 2011 in a
simulated sovereign debt crisis, surpassing the 6 percent
minimum required, the bank said in an emailed statement today in
Ljubljana. NLB said earlier this week the measure of its tier 1
capital strength stood at 7.2 percent.  
 ““Even though the results of the test aren’t below the 6
percent threshold, they show the bank needs a capital boost,”
the Ljubljana-based lender said in the email.  
 Nova Ljubljanska needs to raise up to 600 million euros
($769 million) to cover its liabilities in the next three years.
The lender’s supervisory board announced on July 21 that it will
ask  shareholders  in September to approve a 400 million-euro
capital boost. NLB’s largest owners are the  Slovenian government 
and Belgium’s  KBC Groep NV , both of whom have a third of the
bank.  
 NLB, which holds about a third of Slovenia’s banking
industry and focuses its business in the Balkans, continued to
lose money in the first half as bad loans mounted. Slovenia’s
economy slumped the most in almost two decade last year as
demand for its exports in the European Union disappeared.
