             Gold rose for a fourth day in New
York, climbing above $1,200 an ounce on speculation that
investors will increase purchases of the precious metal as a
means of protecting wealth.  
 The euro rebounded against the dollar before stress-test
results today that may reveal loan losses at European banks.
Gold, trading at the highest price in a week, is set for its
biggest weekly increase since the five days ended June 18.  
 “The dip-buying interest seen in gold over the past few
days is an encouraging indicator and suggests ongoing
diversification from fiat currencies by investors looking for
more tangible assets,” said  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London. “We could see a volatile close
tonight” as the stress-test results are released, he said.  
 Gold futures for August delivery added $4.60, or 0.4
percent, to $1,200.20 an ounce at 8:28 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are up 1 percent this week. Gold for immediate
delivery in London was 0.5 percent higher at $1,201.  
 Bullion fell to $1,198.75 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,199.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The
dollar slid as much as 0.6 percent.  
 Gold futures are up 9.1 percent this year and set a record
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21 as investors sought to protect
their wealth against the European debt crisis and on concern
that the global economy may slow. Results from the European
Union’s bank stress tests may be published starting at 6 p.m.
Brussels time today as regulators determine whether lenders can
survive possible losses on sovereign-debt holdings.  
 SPDR Assets  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, fell 6.08 metric tons to 1,302.05 tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs declined 7.1 tons to 2,064.6 tons
yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 “Gold has currently lost the support which helped drive
prices to a record,”  Wang Huijia , an economist at China
Merchants Futures Co., said from Guangzhou. “The Europe debt
crisis seems to have calmed down; however, gold’s declines will
be limited, as a resolution is far from over.”  
 The euro gained against the dollar after Ifo institute data
showed German business confidence unexpectedly surged to a
three-year high in July after exports boomed and economic growth
accelerated. The U.K. economy expanded almost twice as much as
economists forecast in the second quarter, the Office for
National Statistics said today.  
 Gold Outlook  
 Twelve of 27 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 44 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Seven forecast lower prices and eight were neutral. Gold will
average $1,205 this year, up from a previous estimate of $1,129,
according to UBS AG. It has averaged $1,159.70 so far.  
 “We believe the spotlight will return to focus on
sovereign-debt burdens in Europe and beyond,” UBS analysts
including  Edel Tully  said in a report dated yesterday. “The
fear of further debasement of fiat currencies follows closely.
In turn, we expect the fear trade” will increase in the second
half and into next year, the analysts said.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York rose 0.6 percent
to $18.23 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery gained 1
percent to $1,544.80 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
was 0.9 percent higher at $461 an ounce.
