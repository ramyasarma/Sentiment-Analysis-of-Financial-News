             Wheat futures rose in Chicago,
reversing an earlier loss, on renewed concern that drought in
Russia may global cut supplies. Corn and soybeans also gained.  
 September-delivery wheat advanced as much as 0.8 percent to
$6.0125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, reversing a 0.5
percent loss. The contract traded at $5.99 a bushel at 4:17 p.m.
in Singapore, taking the fourth weekly gain to 2 percent.  
 About 20 percent, or 10 million hectares (24.7 million
acres) of Russia’s grain plantings were ruined by the worst
drought in at least a decade, Ekho Moskvy reported, citing
Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik. Russia was world’s third-
largest wheat producer in the 2009-2010 season, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 “Adverse weather conditions in major growing regions
around the world can be a bullish factor,” CWA Global Markets
Pty said in a report e-mailed today. Dry weather will hurt yield
prospects, it said.  
 Japan is seeking to buy 153,326 metric tons of milling
wheat from the U.S., Canada and Australia in a regular tender on
July 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
said today. The Asian nation was  forecast  by the USDA on July 9
to import 5.2 million tons in the 2010-2011 season, making it
the world’s fourth-largest buyer.  
 December-delivery corn advanced 0.5 percent to $3.925 a
bushel at 4:17 p.m. Singapore time, erasing an earlier loss of
as much as 0.6 percent. The contract is set for a 3.6 percent
decline this week, the first loss this month.  
 Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.3 percent to $9.825 a
bushel, reversing a loss of 0.3 percent. The contract is headed
for a 0.3 percent loss this week, the first in the past three
weeks.
