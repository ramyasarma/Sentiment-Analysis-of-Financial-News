             Barilla Holding SpA , the world’s
biggest pasta maker, plans to invest 400 million euros ($517
million) to develop new types of pasta and boost sales in North
America.  
 “We’re working on product innovation to make different
kinds of pasta that will be a very good source of energy,” Vice
Chairman  Paolo Barilla  said in an interview recorded with
Bloomberg TV.  
 The investments, to be spread out over the next three
years, will help boost the company’s position in the U.S. and
Canadian markets, Barilla said. The Italian company’s U.S. pasta
sales rose by almost 12 percent to $500 million last year, when
Barilla had a 28 percent market share.  
 Barilla currently has no plans to enter the Chinese market,
the chairman said.  
 The family-owned pasta maker, which said in May that it was
evaluating offers for its Kamps GmbH network of bakery shops,
wants to remain in the bakery business, as it fits with
Barilla’s other operations, the chairman said. In addition to
Germany, Barilla has bakery operations in countries including
Italy and France.  
 Earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 19 percent last year to 527 million euros
after businesses in the U.S. started to generate a profit. Sales
slipped almost 7 percent to 4.2 billion euros after the sale of
the Spanish La Bella Easo baked-goods unit.  
 Barilla said he wants the company to remain a family
business.
