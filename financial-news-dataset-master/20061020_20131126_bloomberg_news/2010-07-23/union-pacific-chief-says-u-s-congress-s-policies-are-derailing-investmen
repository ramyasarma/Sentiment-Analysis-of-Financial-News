             Union Pacific Corp. ’s chief
executive officer said U.S. lawmakers are discouraging needed
investment even as federal transit authorities call for $77.7
billion in rail- and bus-system improvements.  
 Congressional legislation now in committee would increase
government oversight of mergers and allow shippers to challenge
rates. The measures are making it hard for rail companies to
plan, Chief Executive Officer  Jim Young  said yesterday in a
telephone interview.  
 “I’m having a hard time seeing how those policies
encourage new investment,” Young said. In addition, he said the
government’s push for high-speed passenger rail service
distracts from the more pressing concerns for freight.  
 Rail and bus systems nationwide need billions of dollars
in improvements to reach good condition, the Federal Transit
Administration said July 21 in a report.  
 Union Pacific, the largest U.S. railroad by 2009 revenue,
said yesterday second-quarter  net income  jumped 53 percent to
$711 million, or $1.40 a share, from $465 million, or 92 cents,
a year earlier. The average  estimate  of 25  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg was a profit of $1.21 a share.  
 The company’s shares rose $1.11 to $73.51 at 1:10 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , after gaining 4.8
percent yesterday. Union Pacific gained 13 percent this year
before today.  
 The company will invest $2.6 billion in its rail
infrastructure this year, $2 billion of which will go toward
maintaining facilities, track and equipment, Young said.  
 High-Speed Rail  
 Union Pacific, based in Omaha, Nebraska, agreed July 20 to
move forward on a high-speed rail line from Chicago to St. Louis
after settling with the government on minimum terms, including
recovery of its initial investment. Work is scheduled to begin
in September.  
 “If I had a choice, I wouldn’t be doing this investment,”
he said. “We need to focus on freight for our good and for the
good of the country.”  
 Union Pacific committed to the plan when it acquired
Southern Pacific Railroad -- and the Illinois line -- in 1996,
Young said.  
 The company was among the U.S. freight railroads that
objected to May guidance from the Federal Railroad
Administration that spelled out relationships between them and
operators of high-speed passenger service on their tracks.  
 The Chicago-St. Louis route received $1.1 billion from last
year’s $787 billion economic-stimulus package. Passenger trains
will travel 110 miles an hour on the new line, Young said.  
 Campaign Contributions  
 President  Barack Obama  has promoted high-speed rail since
taking office in 2009. Young has  contributed  more than $70,000
to the Republican Party and its candidates since 2003, according
to the website Opensecrets.org, which tracks campaign
contributions. Democrats are the majority of sponsors on the
regulatory bills Young criticized.  
 Union Pacific’s sales rose 27 percent to $4.18 billion in
the second quarter, led by a doubling of revenue from hauling
automobiles. The increase in volume was expected because the
auto industry was “for all practical purposes shut down” last
year, Young said.
