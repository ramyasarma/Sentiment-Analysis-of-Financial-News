             Air New Zealand Ltd.  said Auckland
International Airport Ltd.’s proposal to buy a stake in
Queenstown’s airport may push up fares, and it says a group of
airlines would be a better investor.  
 Air New Zealand would be willing to lead a consortium to
take a cornerstone stake, the Auckland-based carrier said in an
e-mailed statement. Alternatively, it would be prepared to
consider proposals to underwrite the development of the airfield
at the South Island resort town so the community retains full
ownership, it said.  
 Auckland Airport, the nation’s busiest, said on July 8 it
agreed to invest NZ$27.7 million ($20 million) in Queenstown in
exchange for a 25 percent stake, with the option of raising its
holding to 35 percent in the future. In cooperation with
majority shareholder, the Queenstown Lakes District Council, the
funds would be used to increase capacity to meet rising
passenger volumes, it said.  
 Auckland Airport “is an expert at squeezing every last
penny from the travelling public,” Bruce Patton, Air New
Zealand group general manager for Australasia said in the
statement. “It would be naive to think it’s not aiming to
increase airline and airport charges which will ultimately
increase the cost of travel into and out of Queenstown.”  
 The companies have been in dispute about landing charges at
Auckland airport, the nation’s busiest.
