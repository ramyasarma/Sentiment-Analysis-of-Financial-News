             Soybeans rose for the fourth
straight day on signs of increased demand in China for supplies
from the U.S., the world’s largest grower.  
 Exporters in the U.S. sold 175,500 metric tons to China for
delivery after Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. An additional 175,000 tons of the oilseed was sold to
unknown destinations, the USDA said. China is the world’s
largest consumer and importer. Soybeans on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange are trading at a premium to Chicago futures.  
 “China is buying U.S. soybeans and the unknown buyer may
be from China,” said  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst for North
America Risk Management Services Inc. in Chicago. “Rising
prices have not slowed Chinese demand” because U.S. shipments
still are cheaper than domestic supply, Gidel said.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 5.25 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $9.8475 a bushel at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Prices are little changed for the week.  
 Soybean exports from Brazil, the world’s second-biggest
producer, may rise 5 percent to a record 30 million tons this
year as China-led demand increases, Sergio Mendes, a director at
the Brazilian Association of Grain Exporters, said July 21.  
 “The Chinese appetite is increasing, and Brazil is ready
to supply what is needed,” Mendes said.  
 China will import a record 48 million tons in the year
ending Sept. 30 and 50 million in the following 12 months,
according to a USDA report this month.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion in 2009, government figures show. Corn is the biggest at
$48.6 billion.
