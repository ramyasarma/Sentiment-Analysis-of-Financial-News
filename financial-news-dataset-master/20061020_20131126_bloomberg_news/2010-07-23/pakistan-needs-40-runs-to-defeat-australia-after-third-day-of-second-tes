             Pakistan needs 40 runs to defeat
Australia at the end of the third day of their second cricket
Test at Headingley in Leeds.  
 Pakistan reached 140-3 in its second innings after starting
the session needing 180 runs to win. Australia’s Doug Bollinger
got Imran Farhat (67) and Umar Amin (0) to increase the pressure
on Pakistan late in the day.  
 Australia was all out for 349 after getting 77 runs from
both Michael Clarke and Steven Smith after starting the day
trailing by 34. The pair helped settle the batting attack after
Pakistan’s Mohammad Ammer took the wickets of captain Ricky
Ponting (66), Michael Hussey (8) and Marcus North (0) in the
morning.  
 Australia was all out for 88 runs in its first innings,
while Pakistan reached 258. Australia had won the toss and
decided to bat, having taken the series’ first match by 150
runs.  
 The series is being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
