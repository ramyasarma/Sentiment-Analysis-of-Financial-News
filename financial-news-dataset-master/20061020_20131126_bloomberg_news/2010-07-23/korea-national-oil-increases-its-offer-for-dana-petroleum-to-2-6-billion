             Korea National Oil Corp.  sweetened
its offer for  Dana Petroleum Plc  to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6
billion) as part of a plan to more than double output by 2012.  
 KNOC, as Korea’s state explorer is known, raised an
indicative takeover proposal for the Aberdeen, Scotland-based
company by 6 percent to 1,800 pence a share, according to a
statement today.  
 “KNOC has not yet received a satisfactory response from
Dana Petroleum to enable both parties to move forward on the
basis of this revised proposal,” it said in a statement today.  
 The Korean producer plans to spend about $6 billion on
acquisitions and projects this year to boost production.  Dana 
holds more than 100 interests in exploration and production
licenses in nine countries.  
 The offer is subject to KNOC being granted access to carry
out due diligence, as well as the unanimous recommendation of
Dana’s board of directors, the statement said.  
 In a statement, Dana urged investors not to take any
action, saying KNOC has failed to meet with its senior
management to discuss the offer.  
 Dana said it will only be prepared to consider granting
exclusivity and access to due diligence to KNOC when it has
received “comfort on financing and other execution risks.”  
 Dana  jumped  13 percent to close at 1,706 pence in London,
the highest price since July 2008. The stock is up 45 percent
since the initial takeover approach on July 2.  
 In June, Dana agreed to buy Suncor Energy Inc.’s Dutch
North Sea assets for 328 million euros ($421 million) in cash in
its biggest purchase to date.
