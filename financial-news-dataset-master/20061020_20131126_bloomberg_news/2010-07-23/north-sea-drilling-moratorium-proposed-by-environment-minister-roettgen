             German Environment Minister  Norbert Roettgen  called for a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the
North Sea to ensure that technological standards are sufficient
to protect the environment.  
 Germany should take the lead in examining whether current
drilling practices pose a risk, Roettgen said on  broadcaster
ZDF . Other countries with North Sea drilling rights probably
wouldn’t go along with such a step, he said.  
 The German minister cited BP Plc’s Gulf of Mexico well
disaster, the worst oil spill in U.S. history. While the
technological standards and the depth of the drilling in the
North Sea aren’t comparable, tests should guarantee that nothing
similar happens off Germany’s northern shores, he said.  
 “We have to examine whether we’re taking on too many risks
-- whether we have to change systems, whether we have to
improve,” Roettgen said in the interview broadcast late
yesterday.
