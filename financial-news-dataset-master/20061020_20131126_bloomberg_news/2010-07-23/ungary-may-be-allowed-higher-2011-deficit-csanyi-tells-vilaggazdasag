             Hungary may reach an agreement with
international lenders for a wider budget  deficit  in 2011 than
the current target of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product,
 Vilaggazdasag  reported, citing  Sandor Csanyi , chairman of  OTP
Bank  Nyrt.  
 The compromise might be for a deficit target bigger than
2.8 percent but smaller than this year’s 3.8 percent, the
newspaper said.  
 It would be justified for the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union to treat the 2011 deficit target with
more flexibility, Csanyi also told the newspaper.  
 He added that he saw no reason for worry over the collapse
of talks between the International Monetary Fund and the
government and that there was time to reach an agreement until
October, Vilaggazdasag reported.
