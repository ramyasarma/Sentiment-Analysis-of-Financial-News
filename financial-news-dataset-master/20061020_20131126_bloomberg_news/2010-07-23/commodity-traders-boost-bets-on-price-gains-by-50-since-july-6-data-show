             Commodity traders increased bets on
price gains for raw materials by 50 percent in the past two
weeks at futures exchanges in New York and Chicago.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators held net-
long position in gold, copper, crude oil and 17 other
commodities totaling 782,247 contracts in the week ended July
20, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 520,530
contracts in the week ended July 6. The 50 percent gain was the
biggest two-week jump since May 2009.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials rallied
1.7 percent this week, the third straight gain, as rising
corporate earnings signaled resilient economic growth and robust
demand for energy, metals and grains.  Open interest  in futures
tracked by the CRB increased 1.2 percent this week, the most
since April 9.
