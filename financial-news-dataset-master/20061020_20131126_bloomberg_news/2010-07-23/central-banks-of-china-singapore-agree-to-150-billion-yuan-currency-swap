             China agreed to a three-year
currency swap with Singapore valued at 150 billion yuan ($22
billion), or S$30 billion, the People’s Bank of China  announced 
on its website today.  
 The swap, which may be extended, aims to facilitate trade
and investment between the two nations, the statement said.  
 China, which had the world’s largest currency reserves of
$2.5 trillion as of June, is seeking to expand the use of yuan
as a global currency and reduce reliance on the dollar. The
central bank has signed at least 650 billion yuan of swap
agreements with Argentina, Indonesia, Belarus, Malaysia, Hong
Kong and Korea since December 2008.
