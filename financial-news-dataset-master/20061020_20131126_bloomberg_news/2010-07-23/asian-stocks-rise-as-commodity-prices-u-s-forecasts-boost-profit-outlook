             Asian  stocks  rose, driving up the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index by the most in more than two weeks,
after Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-estimated earnings
and commodity prices gained.  
 Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world’s largest
electronics contract manufacturer, advanced 5 percent in Taipei
as Microsoft posted record fourth-quarter revenue.  BHP Billiton
Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto Group , the world’s biggest and third-biggest
mining companies, jumped more than 2 percent in Sydney. Komatsu
Ltd., the world’s No. 2 construction-equipment maker, climbed
4.3 percent on speculation it will raise its profit forecast.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 1.7 percent to 117.47 as
of 7:10 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest increase since July 6. The
gauge has slumped 9 percent from this year’s high on April 15 on
concern global growth will slow. Speculation the U.S. economy
will contract intensified as reports in the past month pointed
to a retreat in manufacturing and home sales.  
 “Microsoft’s earnings reiterated that demand for
electronics in the second half is still positive,” said  Monika Yang , who helps oversee $2 billion at Hamon Asset Management Ltd.
in Hong Kong. “This is a boost to Asian stock sentiment as it
stops the earlier noises about possible weak demand.”  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 2.3 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 1.9 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.3 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex index advanced
1.2 percent.  
 Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  climbed 1.1 percent, paced by
developers. China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4 percent,
capping the gauge’s best week in seven months.  
 Microsoft Sales  
 Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased
0.3 percent. The gauge jumped 2.3 percent yesterday, the most in
two weeks, following profit forecasts from companies including
AT&T Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc.  
 After U.S. markets closed yesterday, Microsoft, the world’s
largest software maker, reported a 48 percent climb in fourth-
quarter net income, exceeding the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales advanced 22 percent. About  85 percent  of
S&P 500 companies that have reported results since July 12 beat
analysts’ per-share earnings forecasts, Bloomberg data show.  
 In Taipei, Hon Hai Precision Industry advanced 5 percent to
NT$125.  Asustek Computer Inc. , a maker of low-cost personal
computers, gained 2.1 percent to NT$240. In Tokyo, Fujitsu Ltd.,
Japan’s biggest computer-services provider, rose 3.3 percent to
594 yen.  
 “Company earnings aren’t bad in the U.S.,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Investors will focus on the favorable fundamentals and buy
shares as they have been too pessimistic.”  
 Advantest, Hitachi  
 Advantest Corp. , the world’s biggest maker of chip-testing
equipment, climbed 1.3 percent to 1,902 yen. The company may
turn to a first-quarter profit on recovering overseas demand,
Nikkei English News reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 Hitachi Ltd., which makes electronic equipment, gained 4
percent to 340 yen after Reuters said the company’s first-
quarter earnings were likely better than expected, citing
Hitachi Chairman  Takashi Kawamura .  
 Gauges of industrial, raw-material and information-
technology companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced at
least 1.9 percent today, the most of 10 industry groups. The
MSCI gauge has climbed 1.1 percent this week. The measure’s
third consecutive weekly  advance  narrows its drop this year to
2.5 percent.  
 Companies in the gauge are valued at an average 14.2 times
 estimated earnings , near the lowest level since December 2008.
That compares with 13.3 times for the  S&P 500 Index  and 11.8
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 U.S. Concerns  
 This month’s U.S. economic data fueled concerns recovery in
the world’s biggest economy was slowing. Sales at  U.S. retailers 
declined in June for a second month, the Commerce Department
reported on July 14, while home-builder confidence dropped this
month to the lowest level since April 2009, National Association
of Home Builders/Wells Fargo data on July 19 showed.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index ’s measure of material companies
advanced 1.9 percent after crude oil rallied 3.6 percent in New
York yesterday, while the London Metal Exchange Index, a  measure 
of six metals including copper and zinc, rose 2.3 percent.  
 BHP rose 2.1 percent to A$39.68, the biggest contributor to
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s gain today. Rio Tinto advanced 2.4
percent to A$69.86.  Mitsubishi Corp. , which gets at least 40
percent of its revenue from commodities, increased 3.8 percent
to 1,893 yen in Tokyo.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s biggest
producer, climbed 2.8 percent to HK$16.84 in Hong Kong.  
 Komatsu Forecast  
 JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s second-largest steel producer,
jumped 5 percent to 2,698 yen. The company plans to invest $1
billion in India’s JSW Steel Ltd., according to a person with
direct knowledge of the deal.  
 In Hong Kong,  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. , which develops
real estate projects in China, advanced 2.6 percent to HK$15.10
after its mainland-listed unit,  Shanghai Shimao Co. , said its
first-half net income may rise 700 percent. Shanghai Shimao rose
1 percent to 13.76 yuan.  
 Komatsu  jumped 4.3 percent to 1,796 yen. Chairman  Masahiro Sakane  said the company may further raise its earnings forecast
for this fiscal year “so long as China doesn’t collapse.”  
 Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. gained 4 percent to
1,776 yen. Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots, rose 5.6
percent to 10,320 yen.  
 Economic growth in emerging markets including China will
counter any slowdown in the U.S. and Europe, helping to boost
Asian equities, according to  Graham Muirhead , Singapore-based
head of investment for the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan at
Nomura Asset Management Co.  
 “We’re predicting growth to slow this year but not a
double dip,” Muirhead said in a July 21 interview. “The
markets will probably go higher than people expect.”
