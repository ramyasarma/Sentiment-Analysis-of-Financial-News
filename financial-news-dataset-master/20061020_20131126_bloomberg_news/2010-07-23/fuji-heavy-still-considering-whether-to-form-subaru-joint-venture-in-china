             Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.  said it
hasn’t decided on whether to form a production venture in China
following a Chinese media report that the Japanese maker of
Subaru-brand cars had begun talks on such a proposal.  
 “We are exploring various possibilities in China,
including whether or not to enter the market,” spokesman  Kenta Matsumoto  said by phone from Tokyo. He declined to confirm or
deny a report by China’s Economic Observer newspaper that the
company is in talks with Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.
and Power Diversity Automobile Trade Co. about forming a
production venture.  
 President  Ikuo Mori  said in December he aims to find a
partner to produce cars in China within a year as the company’s
sales increase in the world’s biggest auto market.  
 Fuji Heavy is also talking to two other Chinese automakers
about forming a venture, according to the report, which didn’t
name the companies.  
 Beijing Auto also has partnerships with Hyundai Motor Co.
and Daimler AG in China. Power Diversity, an auto dealer, sells
vehicles including Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Subaru models.  
 Fuji Heavy shares gained 4.9 percent, the biggest gain in
seven weeks, to 476 yen as of 1:14 p.m. in Tokyo.
