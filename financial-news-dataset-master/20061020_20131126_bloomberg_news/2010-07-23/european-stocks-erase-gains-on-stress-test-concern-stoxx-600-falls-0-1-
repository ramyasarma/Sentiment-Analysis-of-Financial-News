             European stocks erased earlier gains
on concern stress tests of the region’s lenders won’t prove
they’re strong enough to withstand a sovereign default.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.1 percent to
254.08 at 2:35 p.m. in London, after earlier rising as much as
0.6 percent.  
 The 91 banks being stress-tested were examined on European
sovereign debt losses for the bonds they trade, rather than
those they hold to maturity, according to a draft European
Central Bank document.  
 The tests will assume a loss of 23.1 percent on Greek debt,
14 percent of Portuguese bonds, 12.3 percent on Spanish debt,
and 4.7 percent on German state debt, according to the document
obtained by Bloomberg News. U.K. government bonds will be
subject to a 10 percent haircut, and France 5.9 percent.
