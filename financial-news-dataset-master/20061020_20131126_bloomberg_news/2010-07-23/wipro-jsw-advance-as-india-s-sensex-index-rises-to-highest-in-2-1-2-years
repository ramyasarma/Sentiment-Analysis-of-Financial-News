             India’s stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index higher for a third week, amid optimism companies
will benefit from increasing demand.  
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. , the nation’s largest mobile-phone
operator, climbed 3.9 percent, driving its weekly advance to 5.1
percent, after saying it’s in the process of buying a 22 percent
stake in Zain’s operations in Zambia.  Bharat Heavy Electricals
Ltd. , the biggest power-equipment maker, rose for a second day
as it reported better-than-estimated earnings.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
climbed 1 percent this week, and advanced 17.83, or 0.1 percent,
to 18,130.98 today, when it swung between gains and losses at
least 15 times. Governments in Europe are due to publish a
report on the region’s banks today as they seek to end concerns
about the health of the banking system.  
 “The overall trend is positive,” said  D.K. Aggarwal , who
manages about $100 million as chairman of SMC Wealth Management
Services Ltd. in New Delhi. “The result of the European banks
stress test is being keenly watched. That will determine the
course of the market.”  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.1 percent to 5,449.10. The  BSE 200 Index  fell 0.1 percent to
2,304.98.  
 Bharti surged to 313.8 rupees. Bharat Heavy climbed 1.8
percent to 2,460.2 rupees, taking its advance this week to 0.9
percent. Net income rose to 6.68 billion rupees ($142 million),
exceeding the 6.3 billion rupee average of 24 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Funds Into India  
 HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the third-biggest lender, declined 0.9
percent to 2,038.6 rupees. European governments’ efforts to trim
budget deficits may damp economic growth across the 16-nation
euro area, and investors are concerned that the results of bank
stress tests, due to be published today, will weigh on market
sentiment.  
 Investors poured money into equity funds focused on India
and China in the week ended July 21 as concerns about economic
growth spurred withdrawals from developed-market stocks, EPFR
Global said in a statement today.  
 India funds received a net $187 million, the most in 51
weeks, while China money managers took in $137 million, EPFR
said.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  3.19 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 22, raising total investments in the stocks
this year to 410.2 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active stocks on the
exchange:  
 Indo Asian Fusegear Ltd.  (INAF IN) jumped 5.4 percent to
108.75 rupees. Legrand SA, a French maker of electrical switches
and plugs, has offered to buy Indo Asian Fusegear’s switchgear
division, the companies said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Riddhi Siddhi Gluco Biols Ltd. (RDSD IN) surged 20 percent
to 338.75 rupees, a record close. The starch maker posted a six-
fold increase in first-quarter profit, according to its
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday.  
 Sutlej Textiles & Industries Ltd.  (SUTJ IN) rose 14 percent
to 185.5 rupees. The textile company’s first-quarter net income
more than tripled to 155.4 million rupees.
