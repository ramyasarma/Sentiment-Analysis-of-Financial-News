             China and Iran are in talks to
settle contracts for oil in the yuan in the face of sanctions
from the United States and Europe, Reuters reported, citing
unidentified industry sources.  
 Iran would open a yuan-denominated account in China to
receive payment for crude oil that the Middle Eastern country
could use for purchases of fuel and equipment and to pay for
projects.  
 China National Petroleum Corp. first made the proposal with
Iran several months ago, the report said.
