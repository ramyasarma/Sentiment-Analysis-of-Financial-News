             BP Plc , battling to contain the
worst oil spill in U.S. history, may revive talks to sell some
of its Alaskan assets after it failed to reach a deal with
 Apache Corp.  this week, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  
 BP has the assets under review, including half its stake in
the  Prudhoe Bay  oil field, said the people who declined to be
identified as the details are private. The London-listed company
may also move to sell other assets, including fields in Vietnam
and Colombia, in coming weeks as bids from potential buyers
exceed the company’s expectations, one of the people said.  
 “They can get a good price,” said  Peter Hitchens , an
analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co. in London. “National oil
companies are always looking to buy. Asset prices are firm.”  
 BP, Europe’s largest oil producer by volume, this week
agreed to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S., Canada and Egypt
to Houston-based Apache for $7 billion, raising cash to meet the
costs of the Gulf of Mexico spill. BP said last month it would
suspend paying dividends, trim capital spending and sell $10
billion of assets to raise cash for the $20 billion fund
demanded by President  Barack Obama  to compensate victims of the
oil spill.  
 A BP spokesman declined to comment today on the prospect
for further asset sales.  
 First Refusal  
 BP had been discussing the sale of Alaskan assets to
Apache. The fields weren’t included in the deal because of the
right of first refusal held by BP’s partners in the assets and
by a lack of agreement over who would operate them, three people
familiar with knowledge of the matter said last week.  
 BP currently owns a 26 percent stake in Prudhoe Bay. Exxon
Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips each have a 36 percent stake,
with Chevron Corp. holding a 2 percent interest, according to
the BP website.  
 “One of the existing partners would be an obvious choice
for a buyer,” said  Iain Armstrong , an analyst at Brewin Dolphin
Ltd. in London. “Prudhoe Bay is in terminal decline, and BP
will be under pressure to go for growth in the next few years.”  
 BP reports second-quarter results on July 27.
