             Colombia’s peso fell for the first
time this week on speculation the central bank will buy dollars
in the foreign-exchange market to ease gains in the currency.  
 Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  told reporters today
after the bank’s monetary policy meeting that Banco de la
Republica “has never ruled out intervening in the market
again.” Banco de la Republica purchased $20 million a day
between March 3 and June 30 to curb a rally policy makers said
left the peso “misaligned.” Uribe’s announcement came after
markets closed.  
 The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1,868.25 per U.S. dollar at 4
p.m. New York time, from 1,862.40 yesterday. The currency has
jumped 9.4 percent this year versus the dollar. It gained 0.5
percent this week.  
 “The peso will continue with its strengthening trend,
unless the central bank intervenes,” said  Carlos Torres , head
analyst at Medellin-based brokerage Asesores en Valores SA.
“Some were expecting an announcement in today’s meeting.”  
 Banco de la Republica left the overnight lending rate at a
record low of 3 percent, matching the forecasts of all 27
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank raised its economic
growth forecast for the year by 1.5 percentage points to a range
of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, today to
7.66 percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price dropped 0.839 centavo to 122.802 centavos per peso.
