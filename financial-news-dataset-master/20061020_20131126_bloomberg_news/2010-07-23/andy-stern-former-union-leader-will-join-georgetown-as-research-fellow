             Andy Stern , former president of the
Service Employees International Union, is joining Georgetown
University’s public policy school as a research fellow.  
 Stern, 59, retired in May after building his union into one
of the largest in the labor movement and increasing his own
influence with President  Barack Obama  and Democratic lawmakers.  
 Stern will coordinate research at Washington-based
Georgetown on wage reform, labor policy and retirement security,
according to an announcement on the school’s website.  
 The new dean of Georgetown’s public policy school is  Ed Montgomery , who is leaving his job as the head of the White
House’s effort to help cities and communities deal with the
decline of the U.S. auto industry.  
 Stern headed the SEIU for 14 years. Some local unions in
his organization complained he focused too much on national
politics rather than wage and workplace issues. He also led
seven unions in bolting from AFL-CIO umbrella labor federation.  
 His replacement,  Mary Kay Henry , has promised to heal rifts
within the SEIU, which represents health-care workers and
janitors, and with other unions.  
 Stern is also a member of Obama’s deficit commission.
