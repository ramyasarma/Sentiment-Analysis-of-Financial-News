             Italian consumer confidence
unexpectedly rose for the first time in three months in July as
households grew more optimistic about the economic outlook.  
 The Isae Institute’s consumer confidence index increased to
105.6 from a revised 104.5 in June, the Rome-based research
center said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists forecast
a reading of 104, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Opinions about the current and future economic situation
in Italy were particularly positive,” Isae said. Consumers were
nonetheless cautious about possible purchases of durable goods,
with their views on the car and real-estate markets worsening,
Isae said.  
 The research center conducted its survey between July 1 and
July 16. The June figure was revised from an originally reported
104.4.
