             Kosmos Energy LLC denied allegations
by the state-owned oil company that it had broken the terms of
its contract to explore for oil off Ghana’s coast.  
 The claims that it had supplied information on its
exploration activities to potential buyers, contravening an
accord with state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corp., were
“totally unsubstantiated,” it said in a statement released in
the capital, Accra, today.  
 Kosmos operates the West Cape Three Points block with a
30.9 percent stake and has an 18 percent stake in the adjacent
Deepwater Tano block, both of which are in the Jubilee field.
The company wants to sell the stakes to ExxonMobil Corp. in a
move opposed by GNPC, which says Kosmos should have sought their
consent before putting the assets up for sale.  
 Kosmos made GNPC data available to more than 20 potential
bidders, including ExxonMobil, without complying with
appropriate safeguards, the state oil company has said.
