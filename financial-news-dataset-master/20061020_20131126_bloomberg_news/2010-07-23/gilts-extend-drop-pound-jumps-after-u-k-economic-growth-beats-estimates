             U.K. bonds extended their declines
and the pound jumped after a report showed the economy grew
almost twice as much as economists forecast in the second
quarter.  
 The drop pushed the yield on the 10-year gilt up five basis
points to 3.41 percent at 9:32 a.m. in London. The pound
strengthened 0.8 percent to $1.5378.
