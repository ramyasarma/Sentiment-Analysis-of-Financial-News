             New York Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo  reopened his probe of former  American International Group
Inc.  executive  Joseph Cassano  after federal authorities closed
theirs, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Cuomo’s office held meetings with Cassano’s lawyers and AIG
earlier this month, and are expected to meet again, the person
said. Cassano, head of AIG’s Financial Products unit until March
2008, made derivative bets on subprime loans that forced AIG
into a U.S. bailout.  
 Cuomo shelved a 2008 investigation of Cassano after federal
authorities began probes. Now he wants to make an independent
assessment of whether Cassano bears any civil liability for his
AIG conduct, the person said.  
 The Wall Street Journal reported today that Cuomo had a
“renewed interest” in Cassano, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.  
 The focus of the U.S. investigations was whether Cassano
misrepresented the value of AIG’s portfolio of “super senior”
credit-default swaps, which insured bond losses tied to the U.S.
housing market. AIG, once the world’s largest insurer, received
a $182.3 billion bailout after these bets went bad.  
 In May, a person familiar with the Justice Department
investigation said after a two-year probe, there was
insufficient evidence to charge Cassano. In June, Cassano’s
lawyers said the SEC also closed its Cassano investigation.  
 “We think they realized that our client acted in good
faith, kept his superiors informed, and was honest with
investors,” Cassano’s lawyers, F.  Joseph Warin  and  Jim Walden ,
of the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP said in a June 16
statement.  
 Warin had no immediate comment on the renewed Cuomo
investigation.  Mark Herr , a spokesman for AIG, declined to
comment, as did  Richard Bamberger , a spokesman for Cuomo.  
 On June 30, Cassano defended the credit-default swaps
blamed for the firm’s losses, according to remarks submitted to
the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
