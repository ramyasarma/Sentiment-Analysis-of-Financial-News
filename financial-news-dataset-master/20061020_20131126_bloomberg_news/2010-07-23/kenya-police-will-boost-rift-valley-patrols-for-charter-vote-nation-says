             Kenya, in planning for a
constitutional referendum on Aug. 4, will deploy as many as
15,000 security personnel to the Rift Valley where some of the
worst fighting happened during post-election violence in 2008,
the  Daily Nation  said, citing police spokesman  Eric Kiraithe .  
 Thousands more officers from the police, army, prison
service and wildlife agency will patrol areas of likely trouble
around next month’s vote to try to prevent violence, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said today, citing Kiraithe.
