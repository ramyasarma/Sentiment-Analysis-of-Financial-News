             The equilibrium level of U.S.
 joblessness  has climbed as a result of the surge in long-term
unemployment caused by the recession, according to Barclays
Capital Inc.  
 The so-called NAIRU, or jobless rate that is consistent
with stable inflation, is now around 7 percent, up from about 5
percent before the economic slump began in December 2007,  Peter Newland , an economist at Barclays Capital in New York, said in a
July 22 note to clients.  
 “Higher unemployment is here to stay,” Newland wrote.  
 An ageing workforce, the loss of jobs in industries like
manufacturing and construction and a decrease in worker mobility
have contributed in pushing up the stasis point, said Newland.
It will be crucial for Federal Reserve policy makers to realize
the rate has shifted in order for central bankers to prevent
prices from climbing once the labor market begins to recover.  
 Older workers, once unemployed, tend to remain jobless
longer than their younger counterparts, according to Barclays
research. So as the labor force ages, unemployment too will tend
to climb, Newland said.  
 Factories  and construction firms, which accounted for 4
million of the 8.4 million jobs lost in the two years ended in
December, are historically slow to rehire workers once the
economy picks up, said Newland. Additionally, workers in these
fields may find it difficult to switch to other industries
because they are relatively well paid and have specific skills
that are not easily transferred, he said.  
 Less Mobility  
 Finally, the residential real-estate slump reduces the odds
jobless workers will be able to sell their houses and relocate
to parts of the country where more jobs may be available,
Newland said.  
 “Several” members of the Fed’s policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee, including  Janet Yellen , are in the camp that
believes the jump in employment is a short-term reaction to the
recession rather than a more permanent shift, said Newland. They
believe that joblessness eventually therefore will fall back to
pre-recession levels, he said. Yellen is President  Barack Obama ’s choice to be the Fed’s next vice chairman.  
 “Were this view to persist when the time comes to tighten,
it could lead to policy staying too loose for too long,”
Newland wrote.
