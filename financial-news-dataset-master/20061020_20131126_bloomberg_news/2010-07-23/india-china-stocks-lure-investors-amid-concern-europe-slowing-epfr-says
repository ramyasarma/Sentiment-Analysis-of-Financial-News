             Investors poured money into equity
funds focused on India and China in the week ended July 21 as
concerns about economic growth spurred withdrawals from
developed-market stocks, EPFR Global said in a statement.  
 India funds received a net $187 million, the most in 51
weeks, while China money managers took in $137 million, EPFR
said. Overall, Asia ex-Japan equity funds got more than $800
million for the second week in a row, and global emerging-market
stock funds received $796 million. Investors pulled $428 million
from Japan equity funds and withdrew money from stocks in
developed Europe for the eighth week in 10.
