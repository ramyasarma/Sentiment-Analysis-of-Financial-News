             The euro reversed losses, Treasuries
retreated and U.S. stocks advanced as European bank stress tests
showed that 84 of 91 lenders passed the examination, easing
concern about the health of the region’s financial system.  
 The euro was little changed at $1.2855 at 12:27 p.m. in New
York after slumping as much as 0.8 percent versus the dollar.
The 10-year Treasury yield increased two basis points to 2.96
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1 percent
to 1,094.38 as financial shares reversed losses.  
 Seven banks failed the region’s stress tests, the Committee
of European Banking Supervisors said today, and had a total
capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion). Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG, the commercial-property lender rescued by the
German government, was the nation’s only bank to fail. A merger
led by Caixa Catalunya failed, according to information
published by the Spanish savings bank association.  
 “No real surprises on the results so far, except for the
Caixa Catalunya merger failing the test,”  Kevin Shacknofsky , who
manages $2.5 billion for Alpine Mutual Funds in Purchase, New
York. “The critical thing remains how these tests were put
together which we’re still learning.”
