             German 10-year government bonds
erased their advance after a report showed that business
confidence in Europe’s largest economy enexpectedly rose in
July.  
 The yield on the 10-year bund was little changed at 2.67
percent as of 9:04 a.m. in London. The two-year yield rose two
basis points to 0.72 percent.  
 The Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, jumped to 106.2, the highest since
July 2007, from 101.8 in June. Economists expected a decline to
101.5, according to the median of 41 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey.
