             T. Rowe Price Group Inc . shares
declined after the Baltimore-based fund manager reported second-
quarter earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  
 Net income  climbed to $158.5 million, or 59 cents a share,
from $100 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Analysts expected earnings of 61 cents,
according to the average of 18  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.
T. Rowe Price  fell  3.2 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  
 T. Rowe Price’s assets fell 6.7 percent in the quarter to
$391.1 billion as the MSCI AC World Index tumbled 13 percent in
May and June because of the European debt crisis and concerns
about slowing global economic growth. Individual investors
started pulling back after markets became more volatile in May,
 James Kennedy , the company’s chief executive officer, said today
in an interview.  
 “Retail investors are still shocked by what has happened
in the past two years,” Kennedy said. “The retail flows backed
off as we got into the second half of the quarter.”  
 T. Rowe Price declined $1.59 to $47.85 at 4:30 p.m. New
York time, after earlier falling as much as 5.2 percent, the
biggest slide since May 20. T. Rowe has slumped 10 percent this
year, compared with the 8.3 percent decline in the Standard &
Poor’s  index  of 15 asset managers and custody banks.  
 Fund Deposits  
 Investors deposited $5.1 billion into T. Rowe Price’s funds
in the quarter, including $1.6 billion into retirement funds
that account for about 12 percent of the firm’s assets.
BlackRock Inc., based in New York, this week reported net
outflows of $30.4 billion as investors removed money from cash
and quantitative funds, while Denver-based Janus Capital Group
Inc. had $1.3 billion in net withdrawals in the three months
ended June 30.  
 “T. Rowe’s business is more skewed to the retirement
channel and is holding up better than most of their peers,”
 Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in
New York, said in an interview before the results were
announced. He expected T. Rowe Price to earn 61 cents a share.  
 T. Rowe Price’s net revenue rose 31 percent to $577.4
million, driven by a 36 percent increase in average assets under
management from a year earlier. Operating expenses rose 13
percent, driven by a 47 percent increase in advertising costs
and higher compensation.
