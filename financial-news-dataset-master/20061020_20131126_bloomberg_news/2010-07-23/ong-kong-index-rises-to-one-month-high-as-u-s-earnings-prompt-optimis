             Hong Kong stocks  rose, lifting the
benchmark index to a one-month high, after U.S. companies lifted
profit forecasts, and Microsoft Corp. posted better-than-
estimated earnings, fueling optimism of a global economic
recovery.  
 Esprit Holdings Ltd., a global fashion retailer, advanced
4.1 percent. Cosco Pacific Ltd., Asia’s third-biggest container-
terminal operator, climbed 2.5 percent.  New World Development
Co. , which got 26 percent of its fiscal 2009 revenue from China,
climbed 3.5 percent after Shanghai Shimao Co., a mainland
developer, said its first-half net income may rise 700 percent.  
 “The earnings forecasts lifted investor sentiment,” said
 Yoji Takeda , head of the Asian equity management team at RBC
Investment (Asia) Ltd., which oversees $1.1 billion. “Whether
the market rally can be sustained depends on earnings due to be
released later.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  gained 1.1 percent to 20,814.60 at the

and extending its advance this week to 2.8 percent. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese
companies climbed 1.4 percent to 11,915.52.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 4.8 percent this year as

crises dented confidence in a global economic recovery. Stocks

data show, down from 17.2 times at the beginning of the year.

percent increase in fourth-quarter net income, exceeding the

posted its biggest sales gain in 2 1/2 years.
