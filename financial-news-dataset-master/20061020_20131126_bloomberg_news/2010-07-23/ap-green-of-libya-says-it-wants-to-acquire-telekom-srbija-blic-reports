             LAP Green Networks, a Libyan phone
operator, wants to acquire a majority stake in Serbia’s state-
owned Telekom Srbija,  Blic  reported, citing a company statement.  
 Abdulbasset Elazzabi, the head of LAP Green, recently met
with Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic , the newspaper said.  
 LAP Green, fully owned by Libyan-African Investment
Portfolio, has made several international acquisitions, though
Telekom Srbija would be its first venture outside of Africa,
Blic said.
