             Mexican authorities discovered at
least 15 bodies in a garbage ditch outside of the city of
Monterrey, said David Perales, spokesman for the Nuevo Leon
state investigation agency.  
 The agency suspects the dead were killed by drug cartels,
Perales said, speaking in a telephone interview from Monterrey,
which is 280 miles south of San Antonio, Texas. Officials are
investigating whether there were more victims, he said.  
 Separately, investigators in the southern town of Taxco
uncovered at least 77 bodies in an abandoned mine last month.
