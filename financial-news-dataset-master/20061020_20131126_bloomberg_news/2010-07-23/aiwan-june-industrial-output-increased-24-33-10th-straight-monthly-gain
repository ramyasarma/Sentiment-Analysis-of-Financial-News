             Taiwan’s industrial production rose
for a 10th straight month in June on increased orders for
computers, mobile phones and television screens.  
 Output  climbed 24.33 percent from a year earlier, after
rising a revised 30.99 percent in May, the  Ministry of Economic
Affairs  said in Taipei today. The median of 15 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 22 percent gain.  
 The global recovery has spurred exports and factory
production, sending Taiwan’s jobless rate to its lowest level in
18 months. The government-backed Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research last week raised its 2010 economic growth
forecast to 6.94 percent from an April estimate of 4.99 percent.  
 “Strong export orders suggest the manufacturing sector is
doing well,”  Icy Hsu , an economist at Bank SinoPac in Taipei,
said before the release. “Going forward, industrial output will
likely continue to be boosted by overseas demand.”  
 Export orders, an indication of shipments in the next one
to three months, increased 22.48 percent in June from a year
earlier, faster than economists expected. The value of orders
may rise to a record $400 billion this year, Huang Ji-Shih, head
of the economic ministry’s statistics division, said this week.  
 Production at manufacturers rose 26.22 percent from a year
earlier, after climbing a revised 33.34 percent in May, today’s
report showed. Output in the mining and quarrying industries
advanced 4.55 percent, and fell 15.38 percent in the
construction sector.  
 Taiwan’s  jobless rate  dropped to 5.2 percent in June, the
island’s statistics bureau said yesterday.
