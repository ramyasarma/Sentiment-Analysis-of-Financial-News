             E*Trade Financial Corp.  surged the
most in eight months after the online brokerage unexpectedly
reported its first quarterly profit in almost three years.  
 The  shares  jumped 7.6 percent to $14.36 at 4 p.m. New York
time, the most since Dec. 18. They have fallen 18 percent in
2010, compared with the 9 percent decline in the NYSE Arca
Securities Broker/Dealer Index.  
 E*Trade reported second-quarter  profit  excluding some items
of 12 cents a share yesterday after setting aside less for
future defaults at its retail banking unit. Analysts estimated a
loss of 11 cents a share, according to the average of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The brokerage had posted a loss
every quarter  since September 2007  because of mortgage defaults
at its E*Trade Bank.  
 “Improving credit quality drove the return to
profitability after three years of outsized credit losses,”
 Daniel Harris , a New York-based analyst with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., wrote in a note to clients today. “We expect that more
favorable credit dynamics will translate into double-digit
declines in loan loss provision expense over the next several
quarters, driving the return to a more normalized earnings
environment by 2012.”  
 Estimates Raised  
 Harris boosted his earnings  estimate  for 2010 to 7 cents a
share from a loss of 35 cents, according to the note. He also
raised 2011 and 2012 projections and reiterated a recommendation
to buy the shares.  
 The company set aside $166 million for future loan defaults
during the second quarter, 38 percent less than during the
three-month period that ended in March.  
 With the return to profitability, E*Trade has the leeway to
invest more in technology, and the company plans to increase
spending on marketing and advertising by about 15 percent to 20
percent in 2010 from last year, Chief Executive Officer  Steven Freiberg  said in a telephone interview yesterday.  
 E*Trade added about 18,000 net new brokerage accounts
during the second quarter, according to the statement. That
compares with 2,000 in the first quarter.  
 Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, gained the most in more than two months after the
San Francisco-based company posted earnings that beat estimates
on July 16.  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp . of Omaha, Nebraska,
reported on July 20 fiscal third-quarter profit and revenue that
beat the average analyst projections as customers traded more
and added assets to their accounts.
