             T. Rowe Price Group Inc ., the asset
manager that posted a profit every quarter since going public in
1986, said second-quarter earnings rose 59 percent, helped by
the highest new client deposits among money managers that have
announced results for the period.  
 Net income  climbed to $158.5 million, or 59 cents a share,
from $100 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts expected
earnings of 61 cents, according to the average of 18  estimates 
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Investors deposited $5.1 billion into T. Rowe Price’s funds
in the quarter, including $1.6 billion into retirement funds
that account for about 12 percent of the firm’s assets.
BlackRock Inc. this week reported net outflows of $30.4 billion
as investors removed money from cash and quantitative funds,
while Denver-based Janus Capital Group Inc. had $1.3 billion in
net withdrawals in the three months ended June 30.  
 “T. Rowe’s business is more skewed to the retirement
channel and is holding up better than most of their peers,”
 Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in
New York, said in an interview before the results were
announced. He expected T. Rowe Price to earn 61 cents a share.  
 T. Rowe Price benefited from a 9.5 percent gain in the  MSCI
AC World Index  of global stock markets in the year ended June
30, spurring an increase in the value of fee-generating assets
to $391 billion. BlackRock, based in New York, and Janus Capital
Group also benefited from the increase in market values.  
 Revenue Increase  
 T. Rowe Price’s net revenue rose 31 percent to $577.4
million, driven by a 36 percent increase in average assets under
management from a year earlier. Operating expenses rose 13
percent, driven by a 47 percent increase in advertising costs
and higher compensation.  
 Results were announced before the start of regular U.S.
trading. T. Rowe has declined 7.2 percent this year, compared
with the 8.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s 15-member
 index  of asset managers and custody banks.
