             Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
fell 90.18, or 0.4 percent, to 20,604.08 at the 17:30 p.m. close
in Milan, trimming this week’s gain to 2.2 percent.  
 The following stocks are among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Italian banks declined before European regulators begin
publishing results of stress tests at 6 p.m. Brussels time
today.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl  (PMI IM) fell 1.9 percent
to 3.82 euros, paring yesterday’s gain.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM)
declined 0.5 percent to 2.04 euros.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM)
retreated 1 percent to 2.4 euros.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) lost 1.5 percent to 96.2 cents. Banco
Popolare SC (BP IM) declined 1.4 percent to 4.6 euros.  Unione di
Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM) declined 1.2 percent to 8 euros.  
 Risanamento SpA  (RN IM) rallied 3.5 percent to 32.7 cents,
rising for the first time in a week. The real-estate company is
due to apply to the Tribunale di Milano for a review of the
sequestration order of the Santa Giulia area, L’Ansa reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  
 STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM) fell 4.6 percent to 6.44
euros even as Europe’s largest semiconductor maker reported
second-quarter net income of $356 million. Analysts were
disappointed by results from its joint venture ST-Ericsson,
which posted a loss of $139 million.
