             Russian billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov 
wants to sell his stake in property developer  PIK Group  for $1
billion,  Kommersant  reported, citing an unidentified person
close to Kerimov’s investment company Nafta Moskva.  
 Kerimov owns 35 percent to 45 percent of the developer, a
holding he acquired in 2009 in exchange for helping the company
renegotiate its debt, the newspaper said.
