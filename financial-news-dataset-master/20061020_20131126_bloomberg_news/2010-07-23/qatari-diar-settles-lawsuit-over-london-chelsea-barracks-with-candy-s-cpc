 The real-estate investment arm of
Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund settled a lawsuit with U.K.
developer  CPC Group Ltd.  over a failed deal to redevelop
London’s landmark Chelsea Barracks site.  
 CPC, controlled by entrepreneur  Christian Candy , accused
Qatari Diar of wrongfully backing out of the deal to avoid
upsetting  Prince Charles , who had complained about the plan’s
design. Under the settlement, Candy dissolved his interest in
the deal and apologized for “any offense” caused by bringing
the Prince of Wales into the case, the companies said today.  
 CPC “will no longer have any interest in, or involvement
with, the former Chelsea Barracks site,” the companies said in
the statement. The site “is owned entirely by Qatari Diar.”
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  
 A joint venture of CPC and Qatari Diar paid 959 million
pounds ($1.47 billion) for  Chelsea Barracks  in January 2008. In
November of that year, Qatari Diar bought out CPC’s stake for an
initial payment of about 38 million pounds and agreed to make 81
million pounds in deferred payments, CPC said.  
 Judge  Geoffrey  Vos ruled on June 25 that Qatari Diar had
wrongfully backed out of the deal and said the parties’
suspicions of each other were “exaggerated.”  
 Candy also apologized to Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh
 Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani , and Qatari Diar Managing
Director  Ghanim bin Saad Al Saad  for “any offense” caused by
the lawsuit, according to the statement.
