             German government bonds may rise
should European Union stress tests for banks only take into
account losses on government bonds the institutions trade and
not those they hold to maturity, UniCredit SpA said.  
 “This basically could create some disappointment in the
market, as not stressing the banking book gives a partial
picture,”  Chiara Cremonesi , a strategist at UniCredit in
London, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  “If the
market remains disappointed, then we could expect a slight
resurfacing of risk aversion with bunds ultimately benefiting.”  
 The haircuts will be applied to the trading book portfolios
only, according to a draft European Central Bank document
obtained by Bloomberg News.
