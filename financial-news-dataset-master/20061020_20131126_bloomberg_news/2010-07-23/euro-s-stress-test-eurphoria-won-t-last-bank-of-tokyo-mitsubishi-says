             Any gain for the euro against the
dollar after European officials release the results of stress
tests designed to examine banks’ resilience today may prove
short lived, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  
 “The lifting of the uncertainty may well prompt a period
of euro buying, especially given the fundamental backdrop of
strong data from Europe,”  Derek Halpenny , European head of
global currency research in London, wrote in a report today.
“But the finer details are unlikely to be as positive and we
maintain that euro-dollar levels above $1.30 will be difficult
to sustain. Creeping disappointment would likely help support
the yen.”  
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.2959 as of 9:38 a.m. in
London.
