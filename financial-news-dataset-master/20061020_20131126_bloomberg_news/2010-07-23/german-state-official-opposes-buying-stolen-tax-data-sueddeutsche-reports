             Wolfgang Kubicki , the parliamentary
leader of the Free Democrats in the northern German state of
Schleswig-Holstein, opposes the state’s purchase of a CD
containing stolen bank data,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  
 A purchase of the data could offer indirect assistance to
organized crime, Kubicki told the newspaper in an interview.
Kubicki’s FDP is in a coalition government with the Christian
Democratic Union in Germany’s most northerly state.  
 The newspaper reported yesterday that Schleswig-Holstein is
in talks with an unidentified source to buy the CD containing
details of “hundreds” of people with money hidden at
 Liechtensteinische Landesbank . The state government declined to
comment on the report, “neither to confirm nor deny it,”
Torsten Borchers, a spokesman for the state’s Finance Ministry.
