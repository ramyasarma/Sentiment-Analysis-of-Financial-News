             British Airways PLC  asked a U.K.
court to add  Air France-KLM Group ,  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. 
and 30 other carriers as defendants in a lawsuit over a price-
fixing cartel for air-freight services.  
 British Airways made the request in the High Court in
London to protect itself against payments it may be ordered to
make in the case, according to a statement today from  Hausfeld &
Co. LLP , the law firm for two flower importers who sued the
airline. The importers are seeking a class-action status.  
 “We hope that this will be a positive move in that it will
encourage airlines to recognize their European liability to
shippers and to start the process of making sensible commercial
settlements,”  Anthony Maton  of Hausfeld said in the statement.  
 British Airways in 2007 pleaded guilty to conspiring to set
extra charges on passenger and cargo flights and was fined $300
million in the U.S. Dozens of carriers have been investigated by
antitrust regulators worldwide since 2006, when the U.S. and the
European Union started probing the industry.  
 “We will continue to contest any class actions brought by
cargo customers,” spokeswoman  Cathy West  said today in an
interview. She declined to comment on the carrier’s request.  
 Air France spokeswoman  Brigitte Barrand  declined to
comment. Elin Wong, a Cathay Pacific spokeswoman didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment, outside of
regular office hours.
