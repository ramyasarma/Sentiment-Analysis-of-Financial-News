             Cocoa futures in New York rose the
most in a week as reports showed improvement in the German and
U.K. economies, boosting demand prospects for the chocolate
ingredient. Coffee also gained.  
 German business  confidence  unexpectedly surged to a three-
year high in July, and the U.K. economy  grew  in the second
quarter by almost twice as much as economists forecast. Europe
accounts for half of global cocoa consumption. The commodity
declined 7.9 percent in the previous four sessions, the longest
slump since March.  
 “Cocoa is up on a technical bounce,” said  Boyd Cruel , a
senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago. Positive
economic news is “giving it some underlying support,” he said.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $50, or 1.7
percent, to $2,966 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since July 14.
Yesterday, the commodity touched $2,902, the lowest level since
June 1.  
 Cocoa may trade from $2,900 to $3,200 for a few weeks
without “surprising news,” Cruel said. Ivory Coast, the
world’s largest producer, begins harvesting in October. This
year, prices are up 9.8 percent.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 4.3
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $1.66 a pound in New York, narrowing
this week’s loss to 0.6 percent.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for September
delivery gained 24 pounds, or 1.1 percent, to 2,297 pounds
($3,540) a ton. Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery
climbed $39, or 2.3 percent, to $1,730 a ton.
