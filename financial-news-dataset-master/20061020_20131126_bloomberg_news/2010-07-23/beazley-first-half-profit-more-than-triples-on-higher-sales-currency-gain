             Beazley Plc , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, said first-half profit more than tripled on higher
sales and a foreign-exchange gain.  
 Net income climbed to $97.9 million in the six months to
June 30, from $31.2 million a year earlier, the Dublin-based
insurer said today in a statement. That beat the $43.1 million
median estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “Beazley delivered a strong result for the first half of
the year -- a period marked by a series of catastrophe losses
and continued intense competition in many lines of business,”
Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Horton  said in the statement.  
 Lloyd’s of London insurers were hurt by record claims in
the first half. Insurers’ losses from natural catastrophes
including February’s earthquake in Chile and European windstorm
Xynthia totaled $22 billion, more than double the average for
the period since 2000, according to Munich Re. Lloyd’s insurers
including Beazley are also liable for as much as $600 million in
claims related to BP Plc’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Revenue in the six-month period climbed 16 percent to
$701.6 million. Beazley, reporting its results in U.S. dollars
for the first time, posted a one-off foreign-exchange gain of
$33.7 million.
