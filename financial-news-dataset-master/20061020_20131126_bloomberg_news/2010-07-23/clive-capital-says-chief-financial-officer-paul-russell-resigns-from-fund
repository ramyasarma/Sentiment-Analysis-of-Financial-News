             Clive Capital LLP said Chief
Financial Officer  Paul Russell  resigned from the commodity hedge
fund firm, which manages about $3.9 billion.  
 Russell left last month, the company said in an e-mailed
reply to questions from Bloomberg News. Russell, 43, started at
Clive in May 2007 and was a partner, according to records at the
U.K.’s  Financial Services Authority .  
 Chief Executive Officer Chris Levett, a former trader at
Moore Capital Management LLC, founded Clive Capital in 2007.
Russell was a partner at Global Advisors Ltd., now a Jersey-
based fund manager, before joining Clive, according to the FSA
records.  
 Hedge funds are private, largely unregulated pools of
capital whose managers can buy or sell any assets and
participate substantially in profits from money invested.
