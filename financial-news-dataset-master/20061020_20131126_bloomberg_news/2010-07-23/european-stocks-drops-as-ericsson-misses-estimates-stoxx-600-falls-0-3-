             European stocks declined, following
the biggest one-day rally for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index in
almost three weeks, as earnings from Ericsson AB missed
analysts’ estimates and investors await the results of stress
tests on the region’s banks.  
 The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.3 percent to 253.64 at 8:05
a.m. in London as Ericsson plunged 6.1 percent to 83.40 kronor
in Stockholm. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in September dropped less than 0.1 percent.
