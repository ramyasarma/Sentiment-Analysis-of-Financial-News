             German bonds declined after reports
showed business confidence in the nation unexpectedly climbed to
a three-year high in July and the U.K. economy expanded more
than forecast.  
 Two-year  yields  rose from near a one-week low after the Ifo
institute said its business climate index jumped to 106.2, the
highest level since July 2007, from 101.8 in June. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a drop. The securities pared
their declines after a draft European Central Bank document
obtained by Bloomberg News said the 91 banks undergoing stress
tests were only examined on European sovereign debt losses for
the bonds they trade, rather than those they hold to maturity.  
 “Ifo surprised to the upside, and that’s hurting bunds,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at
RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and investors.  
 The yield on the German two-year note advanced six basis
points to 0.76 percent as of 4:24 p.m. in London. The 0.5
percent security due June 2012 fell 0.11 or 1.1 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,283) face amount, to 99.525. Ten-year yields rose four
basis points to 2.71 percent.  
 Two-year yields fell almost two basis points this week,
while 10-year yields gained 12 basis points.  
 The stress tests will be published by the Committee of
European Banking Supervisors at 6 p.m. in Brussels.  
 Stress Tests  
 Bunds extended their slide after a report showed Britain
posted its strongest  economic growth  in four years. Gross
domestic product increased 1.1 percent in the three months
through June, from a 0.3 percent gain in the previous quarter,
data from the Office for National Statistics in London showed
today. That was almost twice as much as economists forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 German bonds returned 6.5 percent this year, compared with
6.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 5.8 percent for U.K. gilts,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit.  
 Regulators are scrutinizing banks to assess if they have
enough capital, defined as a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6
percent, to withstand a recession and sovereign-debt crisis,
according to a document from the  CEBS. Lenders  that fail the
trials will be made to raise additional capital.  
 The tests will assume a loss of 23.1 percent on Greek debt,
14 percent on Portuguese bonds, 12.3 percent on Spanish debt,
and 4.7 percent on German state debt, according to the ECB
document. U.K. government bonds will be subject to a 10 percent
haircut, and France 5.9 percent.  
 ‘Haircuts Applied’  
 “The haircuts are applied to the trading book portfolios
only, as no default assumption was considered,” according to a
confidential document dated July 22 and titled, “EU Stress Test
Exercise: Key Messages on Methodological Issues.”  
 Greek 10-year bonds rose, with the yield falling eight
basis points to 10.44 percent. The yield on the similar-maturity
Portuguese security slipped was little changed at 5.59 percent,
with Spanish yields unchanged at 4.38 percent. The French 10-
year bond yield was one basis point higher at 3 percent.  
 U.S. regulators published the metrics they used to test
their banks before they released their results last year. U.S.
bank stocks rallied 36 percent in the seven months following the
trials.
