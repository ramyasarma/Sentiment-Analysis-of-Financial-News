             Amtrak, the U.S. long-distance
passenger railroad, said it will spend $298.1 million to buy 130
rail cars as part of a plan to replace its aging fleet.  
 Amtrak will buy the cars, to be built in Elmira, New York,
from the U.S. unit of Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles
SA, a Spanish train maker. The Washington-based railroad
announced the purchase today in an e-mailed statement.
