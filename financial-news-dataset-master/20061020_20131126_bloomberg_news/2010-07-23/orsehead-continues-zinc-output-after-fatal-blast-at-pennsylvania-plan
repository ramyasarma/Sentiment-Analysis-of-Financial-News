             Horsehead Holding Corp. , the largest
U.S. zinc producer, said it will continue to produce the metal
at a plant in Pennsylvania while investigating an explosion that
killed two workers and injured two others.  
 The blast at the zinc refinery of the Monaca factory
occurred at about 4:30 p.m. local time yesterday, Pittsburgh-
based Horsehead said today in a statement. Zinc metal production
continues at the smelting operations while refining is suspended
pending an accident investigation, Horsehead said.  
 Monaca can refine 90,000 tons of zinc oxide a year and is
the country’s largest zinc smelter, with the capacity to
annually produce 88,000 tons of prime western zinc metal and
15,000 tons of “special special” high-grade zinc metal,
according to the company’s  annual report .  
 Horsehead fell 36 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $7.73 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 39
percent this year.  
 The explosion involved a refinery column that makes zinc
oxide,  Ali Alavi , a Horsehead spokesman, told the Associated
Press yesterday. He didn’t return a call today from Bloomberg
News seeking comment.  
 Horsehead said it’s working with customers to minimize
supply disruptions.  
 Zinc for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped $42.50, or 2.2 percent, to $1,906 a metric ton
as of 9:08 p.m. U.K. time.  
 Horsehead declined to release the names of the employees
who were killed or the injured workers who were released from
local hospitals yesterday.
