             Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said today Fiat SpA should be free to shift
production where it wants, though he “hoped” the carmaker’s
decision would not hurt Italian manufacturing.  
 Fiat will start making a new family car, currently labeled
the N zero, at its plant in Serbia, Belgrade-based newspaper
Blic reported yesterday.  
 Berlusconi, during a news conference in Milan, was asked to
respond to Fiat’s plans to move some auto production to Serbia.
