             Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
denounced North Korean aggression and urged Myanmar to make its
first elections in two decades more democratic.  
 “Here in Asia, an isolated and belligerent North Korea has
embarked on a campaign of provocative, dangerous behavior,”
Clinton told the 27-member Asean Security Forum in Hanoi today.
“Peaceful resolution of the issues on the Korean Peninsula will
be possible only if North Korea fundamentally changes its
behavior.”  
 The remarks, made in the presence of North Korean Foreign
Minister  Pak Ui Chun , came two days after Clinton announced new
U.S. sanctions against the regime for sinking a South Korean
warship in March.  North Korea  yesterday attacked her actions and
maintained that it didn’t torpedo the corvette Cheonan.  
 Clinton also used her speech to put pressure on Myanmar, an
Asean member that she referred to by its former name of Burma.  
 “The United States also remains deeply concerned about the
oppression taking place in Burma, including restrictive
electoral laws that further stifle the lives of the Burmese and
make the possibility of free and fair elections this year
unlikely,” she said, according to a State Department transcript.
“We urge Burma to put in place the necessary conditions for
credible elections, including releasing all political prisoners,
respecting basic human rights, and ceasing attacks against
ethnic minorities.”
