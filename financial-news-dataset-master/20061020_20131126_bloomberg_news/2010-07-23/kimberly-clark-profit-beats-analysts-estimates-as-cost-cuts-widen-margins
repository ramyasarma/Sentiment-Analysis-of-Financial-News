             Kimberly-Clark Corp. , the maker of
Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, posted a second-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates as operating margins
widened on cost cutting.  
 Net income rose 24 percent to $498 million, or $1.20 a
share, from $403 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier, the
Dallas-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
projected $1.13, the average of 13  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 2.8 percent to $4.86 billion.  
 Kimberly-Clark has cut spending and expanded its health-
care and professional units in an effort to depend less on
paper-intensive products. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer  Tom Falk , said in April it expects commodity costs to
rise this year. Last year, Kimberly-Clark cut about 1,600 jobs,
or 3 percent of its workforce.  
 The company forecast organic sales to grow 2 percent to 4
percent this year, compared to a previous projection of 3
percent to 4 percent.  
 Kimberly-Clark  rose  47 cents to $63.43 at 10:07 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had fallen 1.2
percent this year before today.
