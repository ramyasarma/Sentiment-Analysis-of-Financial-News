             Siemens AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  has called on Britain to improve its port
infrastructure to accommodate wind turbine blades as part of its
investment in offshore wind power, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview with Loescher.  
 The previous U.K. government’s 60 million-pound ($91.7
million) commitment to overhaul some U.K. ports may be
abandoned, the newspaper said, without saying where it obtained
the information.
