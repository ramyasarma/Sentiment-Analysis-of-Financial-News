             Porsche SE ’s supervisory board is
set to approve the production of its 918 Spyder hybrid sports
car at a meeting next week, according to two people with direct
knowledge of the matter.  
 Porsche plans to develop the vehicle at a research facility
in Weissach near Stuttgart, Germany, and build it at the main
plant in Zuffenhausen, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The July 28
board meeting may also discuss Porsche’s  financial performance 
for the year ending July 31, they said.  
 The 918 Spyder, one of three hybrid models Porsche
presented at the Geneva auto show in March, has attracted at
least 2,000 non-binding submissions of interest, people familiar
with the matter said on July 12. Porsche needs at least 1,000
sales pledges to sign off on building the car, development chief
 Wolfgang Duerheimer  said in April.  
 “The Spyder will pay off for Porsche even though it may
only come in limited numbers,” said Tim Schuldt, an analyst at
Equinet AG in Frankfurt who recommends buying the stock. The
vehicle may be introduced in about three years, Schuldt said.  
 The supercar, which soars to 100 kilometers an hour in 3.2
seconds, may be priced at about 500,000 euros ($640,000),
topping the Carrera GT as Porsche’s costliest model, people
familiar with the matter said July 12. No more than 1,500 units
of the Carrera GT were produced.  
 Workers’ Accord  
 Albrecht Bamler , a Porsche spokesman, declined to confirm
the board meeting.  
 The two-seater car accelerates to a top speed of 320
kilometers (199 miles) per hour, relying on a 500-horsepower V8
engine and electric drive-systems allowing the vehicle to run up
to 25 kilometers on electric power.  
 Stuttgart-based Porsche agreed with worker representations
this week on measures to preserve jobs and improve productivity
through 2015. The accord includes a pledge to build the 918
Spyder if the car draws sufficient interest, people familiar
with the matter said today.  
 Porsche plans to add models with a goal of doubling annual
sales to as many as 150,000 vehicles over the medium term, and
benefit from savings from a merger with  Volkswagen AG .  
 Shares of Porsche  rose  1.66 euros, or 4.4 percent, to 39.13
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt. The stock
has dropped 11 percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 6.9
billion euros.
