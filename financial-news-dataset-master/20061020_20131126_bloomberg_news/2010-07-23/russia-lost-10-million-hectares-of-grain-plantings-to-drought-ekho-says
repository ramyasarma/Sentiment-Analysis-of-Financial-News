             About 20 percent, or 10 million
hectares (24.7 million acres) of Russia’s grain plantings were
ruined by the worst drought in at least a decade, Ekho Moskvy
reported, citing Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik .  
 Emergencies have been declared in 23 regions, Skrynnik told
the Moscow-based radio station in an  interview  late yesterday,
adding that there are no reasons for increases in bread prices
because of government support measures.  
 About 9.6 million hectares of plantings were ruined as of
July 15, according to the Agriculture Ministry.
