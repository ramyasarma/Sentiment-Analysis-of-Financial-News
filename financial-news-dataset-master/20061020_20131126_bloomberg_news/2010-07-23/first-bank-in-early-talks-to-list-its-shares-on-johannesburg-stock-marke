             First Bank of Nigeria Plc is in
talks with South African officials to list its shares on
Johannesburg’s stock exchange, Oluyemisi Lanre-Philips, head of
investor relations, said on a conference call today.   
 The listing will be aimed at increasing liquidity for
investors, not to raise capital, Lanre-Philips said.
Negotiations with South African officials are still ongoing and
are at a preliminary stage, she said.
