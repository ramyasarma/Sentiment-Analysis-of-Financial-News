             Japan’s copper wire and cable
shipments climbed 5 percent in June from a year earlier, gaining
for the sixth-straight month, as the country’s export-led
economy grew.  
 Shipments, including exports and domestic business,
increased to 56,100 metric tons last month, from 53,452 tons a
year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’
Association  said today in an e-mailed statement.
