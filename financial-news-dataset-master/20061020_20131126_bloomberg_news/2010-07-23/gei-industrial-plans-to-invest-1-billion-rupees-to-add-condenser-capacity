             GEI Industrial Systems Ltd. , an
Indian supplier to power plants, plans to spend 1 billion
rupees ($21.3 million) by September 2011 to add capacity to
make air-cooled steam condensers as demand increases.  
 The company, based in Bhopal, India plans to make
condensers for 600 megawatt power plants, compared with its
present capacity to supply 300-megawatt generators, Chairman  C. E. Fernandes  said.  
 “Power generators prefer air-cooled systems because of
the efficiency and also because of uncertainties involved with
water system,” Fernandes said in an interview in Mumbai.
“That is we are confident of a significant increase in
business.”  
 GEI Industrial expects to secure orders valued at 6
billion rupees for its condensers this year. India needs to
spend $1 trillion on power plants, ports, road projects in the
five years ending 2017 to accelerate economic growth, according
to the nation’s Planning Commission  
 GEI  shares  rose 0.9 percent to 149.1 rupees at 2:59 p.m.
in Mumbai. The shares have more than doubled this year while
the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index  has risen
3.7 percent.  
 Asia’s third-largest economy has installed power
generation capacity of  162,367  megawatts, according to the
 Central Electricity Authority . The government aims to expand
that to 286,756 megawatts by the end of the financial year
ending March 2017, according to the  Planning Commission .
