             Gold fell in New York for the first
time in four days as traders reduced risk before the results of
stress tests on 91 banks in Europe, where a financial crisis
sparked a surge in bullion prices last month.  
 European Union regulators are examining the strength of
banks to determine if they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-bond holdings. Gold reached a record $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21, and last month rallied to all-time highs in
euro, sterling and Swiss francs.  
 “There’s just caution on the part of traders,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “People
aren’t sure how the markets are going to react, so rather than
have a large position in gold, they’re paring back.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery dropped $2.80, or 0.2
percent, to $1,192.80 an ounce at 11:34 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Before today, gold rallied 9.1 percent this year.  
 Results of the bank stress test will be released at 6 p.m.
in Brussels.  
 Gold’s losses may accelerate should equities decline after
the announcement, because investors are likely to sell the metal
to cover losses, Lesh said. Investors may also buy the metal as
a haven, he said.  
 “If things turn out much worse than expected and the euro
has a sharp decline, I’d go into gold,” Lesh said.  
 Silver futures for September delivery gained 9 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $18.21 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $20.20, or 1.3
percent, to $1,549.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium futures for September delivery advanced
$7.50, or 1.6 percent, to $464.40 an ounce.
