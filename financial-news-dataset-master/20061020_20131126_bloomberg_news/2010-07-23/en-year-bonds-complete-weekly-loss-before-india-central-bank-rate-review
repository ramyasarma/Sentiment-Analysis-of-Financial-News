             India’s benchmark  bonds  completed a
weekly loss on speculation the central bank will increase
interest rates for a second time this month to slow inflation
that has exceeded 10 percent in the past five months.  
 Yields on 10-year securities rose today to near their
highest in a more than a month, after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh’s  top economic adviser said the central bank must raise
borrowing costs to cool increase in prices. The  reverse-
repurchase rate  will be raised by a quarter of a percentage
point to 4.25 percent, according to all 20 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before the July 27 policy review.  
 “Investors seem to be averse to taking any positions
ahead of the crucial meeting,” said  Roy Paul , a deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Some tightening is
expected to curb inflation.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 rose
four basis points this week, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.68
percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate touched 7.69 percent on
July 21, the highest rate since June 14. The price fell 0.05,
or 5 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.75.  
 All except one of the 20 economists surveyed predict a
quarter of a percentage increase in the repurchase rate to 5.75
percent.  
 Wholesale prices  climbed 10.6 percent from a year earlier
in June, following a 10.2 percent gain in May. An increase of
11.2 percent in April was the biggest since September 2008. The
central bank raised interest rates for a third time this year
on July 2.  
 “Given the persistent high inflation, we recommend
tightening of the monetary policy,”  Chakravarthy Rangarajan ,
chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council,
said. Inflation rate may decline to about 7 percent to 8
percent by December, he said.  
 Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said he
met Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  today to review the
economic situation.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps, derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, increased this
week. The fixed payment made to receive a floating rate rose 11
basis point to 5.89 percent.
