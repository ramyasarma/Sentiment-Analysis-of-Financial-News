             South Africa’s Mineral Royalty and
Petroleum Resources Act, implemented from March, taxes “some of
the super-profits that the resource sector generates,” Finance
Minister Pravin Gordhan said.  
 Gordhan was responding to a question from a lawmaker on
whether South Africa will impose a mining tax similar to that
proposed by Australia. South Africa only announces tax proposals
at the time of the budget, Gordhan said in a written reply to
the question, which was e-mailed by Parliament today.
