             The rate that banks say they charge
for three-month loans in euros in London rose to an 11-month
high, the British Bankers’ Association said.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
rose to 0.821 percent from 0.816 percent yesterday, the BBA
said. The rate was at 0.825 percent on Aug. 21, 2009.  
 Libor for three-month dollars fell to 0.493 percent from
0.498 percent, widening the spread with euro Libor to a four-
month high of 33 basis points.
