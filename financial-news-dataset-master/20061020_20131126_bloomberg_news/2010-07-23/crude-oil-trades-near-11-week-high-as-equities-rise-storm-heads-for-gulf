             Crude oil headed for a weekly gain,
trading near the highest in 11 weeks, as rising equity markets
signaled improved prospects for an economic recovery in the U.S.
and Tropical Storm Bonnie headed for the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Oil has risen 4.6 percent this week as global stock markets
rallied on growing optimism about the world’s economy. Bonnie is
forecast to move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it’s already
delaying efforts by BP Plc to permanently plug its wrecked
Macondo well, according the  National Hurricane Center .  
 “Oil prices are currently driven up by financial markets,
including benign stock markets and a weaker U.S. dollar, and
supply risks related to the tropical storm,” said  Carsten Fritsch , a Commerzbank AG analyst in Frankfurt. “Fundamentals
still look pretty poor and don’t justify prices close to $80.”  
 Crude for September delivery traded at $79.51 a barrel, up
21 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 9:18 a.m. in London. Yesterday, the contract rose as
high as $79.42, the highest price since May 5.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange traded at $78, up 18 cents.
Yesterday, the contract jumped $2.45, or 3.3 percent, to $77.82,
the highest settlement since June 25.  
 European stocks advanced, led by basic-resources shares and
Vodafone Plc. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.5
percent to 255.55 as of 9:19 a.m. in London. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent.  
 Tropical Storm  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie hit the Bahamas and was on a track to
take it across or near southern Florida and into the Gulf of
Mexico, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  
 The Gulf accounts for about 31 percent of U.S. oil output
and 10 percent of its natural-gas production, according to the
Energy Department. The coast along Louisiana and Texas is home
to 42 percent of U.S. refining capacity.  
 The U.S. Energy Department said on July 21 U.S. crude
stockpiles grew by 360,000 barrels last week. Gasoline
inventories climbed 1.12 million barrels to 222.2 million
barrels, the highest level since April.  
 Crude oil may fall next week on speculation that U.S.
inventories will climb as imports increase, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  
 Thirteen of 34 analysts, or 38 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 30. Eleven respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and 10 saw an
increase. Last week 39 percent of analysts forecast a drop.
