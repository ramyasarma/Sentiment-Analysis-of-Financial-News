             The U.K.’s  Office of Fair Trading 
said it completed a review of companies buying gold from
customers through the mail and will provide an update in early
August.  
 The authority had requested gold buying companies to
provide details on business practices and explain claims made in
advertising. OFT had said it wanted to consider whether the
companies were complying with consumer protection legislation,
such as whether customers’ rights to reject an offer for their
gold and receive the metal back were being honored in all cases.  
 OFT previously said that no assumption should be made that
any company had breached consumer protection legislation.
Today’s announcement was posted on its website. Pritie
Billimoria, a London-based spokeswoman, declined to give further
details.  
 OFT is the U.K.’s consumer and competition authority and
aims to ensure markets work well for consumers.  
 Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,189.10 an ounce at
5:03 p.m. in London. The metal reached a record $1,265.30 on
June 21 and is up 8.4 percent this year.
