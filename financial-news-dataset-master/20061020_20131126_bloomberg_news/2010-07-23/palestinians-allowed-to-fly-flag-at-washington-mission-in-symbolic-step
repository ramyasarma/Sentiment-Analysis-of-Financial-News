             The Palestine Liberation
Organization’s mission in Washington can now fly its red, white,
black and green flag, and the Palestinians can call their post a
general delegation, the U.S. State Department said today.  
 The change doesn’t grant the Palestinians diplomatic status
or immunity, State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  told
reporters in Washington.  
 “These steps have symbolic value,” Crowley said. “They
reflect improved relations between the United States and
Palestinians, but they have no meaning under the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations.”  
 The Obama administration is trying to make headway toward
direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians on issues that
stand in the way of a Palestinian state, including how Israel’s
security would be assured.  
 The Jerusalem Post, citing state-owned Israel Radio, said
that, according to senior officials in his office, Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  was aware of the decision in advance
and that the move was apparently intended to strengthen
Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas . The authority is
the internationally recognized representative of the
Palestinians in talks with Israel.  
 Abbas’s Fatah faction of the PLO is engaged in indirect
talks with Israel under the guidance of U.S. diplomat  George Mitchell .
