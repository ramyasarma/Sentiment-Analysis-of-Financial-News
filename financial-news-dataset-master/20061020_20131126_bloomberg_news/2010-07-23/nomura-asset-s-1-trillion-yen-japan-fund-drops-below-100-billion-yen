             Nomura Asset Management Co. ’s once-
dubbed “1-Trillion-Yen Fund” fell yesterday to its lowest
level since being introduced in 2000 at the height of a bubble
in information-technology stocks.  
 The “Nomura Japan Stock Strategy Fund” saw its net asset
value fall to 99.7 billion yen ($1.15 billion) as of July 22 as
individual investors shifted their cash into foreign equities,
said  Chiho Shimada , chief editor of Toshi Shintaku Jijo, an
investment magazine. Dividend yields for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index and  Euro STOXX 50 Index  are more than 4 percent compared
with about 1.7 percent for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The
 Nikkei  has declined 10.6 percent this year.  
 “The poor performance of Japan’s stocks is one of the
reasons for the unpopularity of the fund,” said Shimada.
“Another is that Japanese stocks have low distribution rates
because of low dividend yields. People are investing for monthly
returns.”  
 The fund started in February 2000, just before the
information technology bubble burst. It attracted 792.4 billion
yen from investors before it began operation.  
 Sales of Japanese stocks funds have been falling, according
to the  Investment Trust Association, Japan . Domestic equity
funds at open-end investment trusts posted 13 consecutive months
of net asset outflow as of June as redemptions and cancellations
exceeded sales, the association’s data show.
