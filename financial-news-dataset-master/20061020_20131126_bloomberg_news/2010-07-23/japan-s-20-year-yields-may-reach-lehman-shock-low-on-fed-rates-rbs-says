             Japan’s 20-year bond  yields  may drop
to levels unseen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September 2008 as the Federal Reserve keeps interest
rates near zero, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. said.  
 Long-term yields in Japan and the U.S. will decline as
investors demand higher returns, said  Akito Fukunaga , Tokyo-
based chief rates strategist at RBS. Japan’s 20-year yields will
likely stay below 2 percent for a “long time,” he said.  
 “The levels below 1.7 percent reached in December 2008
after the Lehman shock will be on the horizon,” Fukunaga said.  
 Japan’s 20-year yields dropped 3.5 basis points to 1.77
percent yesterday, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. They touched 1.735
percent on July 2, the lowest level since January 2009. The
securities have not traded yet today.  
 Thirty-year Treasury yields fell as much as 12 basis points
to 3.86 percent on July 21 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic outlook is “unusually uncertain”
and policy makers are prepared “to take further policy
actions.” Two-year U.S.  yields  dropped two basis points to a
record low of 0.552 percent after Bernanke spoke.  
 Just like what happened with Treasuries, investors stayed
away from lower-yielding shorter-term Japanese debt and opted
for longer-maturity securities, according to  Kazuya Ito , a fund
manager in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd.  
 Japan’s 10-year and 20-year yields yesterday declined 3
basis points and 3.5 basis points, respectively, while five-year
yields fell half a basis point.
