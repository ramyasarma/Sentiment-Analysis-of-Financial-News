             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose 150.14, or 0.5 percent, to 28,424.17 at the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg, bringing the gain this week to 3.3
percent, a third week of increases.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  
 Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the mining company that makes
up about 10 percent of the benchmark index, gained for a third
day, rising 4.87 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 288.37 rand. De Beers,
the world’s largest diamond producer in which Anglo holds a 45
percent stake, said sales surged 84 percent in the first half.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest gold
producer, retreated 4.99 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 297 rand,
bringing its drop this week to 4.1 percent.  Harmony Gold Mining
Co. Ltd. , Africa’s third-largest producer of the metal, lost 1
rand, or 1.3 percent, to 74.40 rand. Gold fell in New York for
the first time in four days as traders reduced risk before the
results of stress tests on 91 banks in Europe, where a financial
crisis sparked a surge in bullion prices last month.  
 Freeworld Coatings Ltd.  (FWD SJ) fell 30 cents, or 3
percent, to 9.70 rand, the biggest slide in a month. The paint
producer said talks with a company it didn’t identify over a
rival bid to Saphirefield Investments’ takeover proposal failed
to result in an offer.  
 Iliad Africa Ltd.  (ILA SJ), the building-materials
distributor, declined for a second day, losing 18 cents, or 2.3
percent, to 7.79 rand after saying first-half earnings per share
may decline as much as 32 percent.  
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP SJ), the second-largest
producer of the metal, rose 3.99 rand, or 2 percent, to 203.50
rand, a fourth day of gains. Platinum for immediate delivery
climbed as much 1.5 percent to $1,548.75 an ounce.  
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ) dropped 7 rand, or 1.9
percent, to 368 rand, snapping six days of advances. Citigroup
Inc. cut its recommendation on the largest African producer of
the steelmaking ingredient to “sell” from “hold.”  
 Lonmin Plc  (LON SJ), a producer of platinum, advanced 4.15
rand, or 2.4 percent, to 175.15 rand, a second day of gains.
Sanford C. Bernstein said a takeover of the company by Xstrata
Plc is more likely now that the price of Lonmin’s stock has
fallen 30 percent from an April peak.
