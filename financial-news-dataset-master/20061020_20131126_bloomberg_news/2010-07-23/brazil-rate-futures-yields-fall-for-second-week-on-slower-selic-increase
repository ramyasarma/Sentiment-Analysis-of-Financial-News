             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts headed for a second straight weekly decline
after policy makers unexpectedly slowed the pace of interest-
rate  increases  in response to decreasing inflationary risks.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, fell 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to
10.9 percent this week. It declined 26 basis points last week.
It last fell for two straight weeks in the period ended Feb. 5.
The yield rose two basis points today at 9 a.m. New York time.  
 Brazil’s central bank increased the benchmark Selic rate by
a half-point to 10.75 percent on July 21. The move, which was
anticipated by traders in the interest-rate futures market,
surprised 48 of 51 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. They
predicted another 0.75-percentage-point increase, the same as at
the bank’s two previous meetings.  
 Policy makers said in a statement accompanying the decision
that inflation risks have eased since their June meeting due to
“the recent evolution of domestic and external factors.”  
 “Brazil has had softer-than-expected core inflation, and
also a soft patch of activity data,” said  Roberto Melzi , a
strategist at Barclays Plc in New York. “That led the central
bank to not hike rates by 75 basis points as analysts had
expected, and the market to price this in.”  
 The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7611 per dollar from
1.7581 yesterday. The currency gained 1.2 percent this week.
