             European stocks rebounded, as
better-than-forecast U.K economic growth, German business
confidence and earnings from Adidas AG to Akzo Nobel NV
offset concern about stress tests on the region’s banks.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index gained 0.4 percent to
255.32 at 2:46 p.m. in London. Stocks briefly erased gains as a
draft European Central bank document showed the 91 banks being
stress-tested were examined on European sovereign debt losses
for the bonds they trade, rather than those they hold to
maturity.
