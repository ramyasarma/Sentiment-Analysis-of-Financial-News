                  July 23 (Bloomberg) --  AES Gener SA  climbed the most this
year in Santiago trading after El Mercurio reported that the
Chilean unit of Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp. won a legal
battle over a hydroelectric project in central Chile.  
 Gener  advanced  3.5 percent to 279 pesos at 9:42 a.m. New
York time and rose as much as 3.9 percent, the steepest intraday
gain since Dec. 10.  
 Opponents of the 530-megawatt Alto Maipo project won’t take
the case to the Supreme Court after an appeals court dismissed
an injunction filed against the environmental impact study, the
Santiago-based newspaper reported, citing Gener Chief Executive
Officer  Felipe Ceron .  
 Gener, along with rival electricity generators Empresa
Nacional de Electricidad SA and Colbun SA, were reiterated
“buy” at Banco Santander SA, which cited prospects of rising
demand and higher prices in a note today.
