             The U.S. beef-cow herd on July 1 was
the smallest in at least 37 years as farmers remained wary of
beef demand during the economic recovery after losing money in
the past two years.  
 The beef-breeding herd totaled 31.7 million head as the
month began, down 1.6 percent from 32.2 million a year earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a semiannual
report. That marked the fewest cows for the date since at least
1973, said  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the University of
Missouri in Columbia. Six analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected a 1.4 percent drop, on average.  
 Cattle producers may make about $51.53 per cow this year,
after losses in 2009 and 2008 because of high feed costs and
declining beef demand, said  Erica Rosa , an economist at the
Livestock Marketing Information Center in Denver. Uncertainty
about economic recovery may be keeping ranchers from expanding
herds, she said.  
 “Overall, cow-calf producers continue to reduce herd
numbers, rather than expand by retaining heifers,” Rosa said by
e-mail. “Although calf and feeder-cattle prices are higher than
2009, input/production costs still remain high and there is
still quite a bit of uncertainty currently and about the
future.”  
 The overall U.S. beef and dairy herd totaled 100.8 million
head at the start of July, down 1.2 percent from a year earlier,
according to today’s USDA report. That also marked the smallest
size for July since at least 1973, Missouri’s Plain said. The
USDA’s estimate matched analysts’ expectations before the
report.  
 ‘Steady’ Decline  
 “It’s a steady, continuing decline,” Plain said after the
report. Farmers “lost money, and that’s why they started
cutting back. As to why they keep cutting, there’s just a lot of
uncertainty. I wonder how many cattlemen were short on money for
a variety of reasons like the tough economy, and now they’re
selling off a few cows to generate cash.”  
 An additional 4.4 million beef heifers were being kept back
for breeding in the next year, down 2.2 percent from July 2009.
Analysts expected a 2.1 percent decline. Dairy farmers were
holding 4.05 million replacement heifers back for breeding, 2.5
percent more than a year earlier and more than the 0.07 percent
increase expected by analysts.  
 “The dairy guys have had a tough time of it and lost a lot
of money, but they don’t seem to be able to resist the
temptation to save a lot of heifers,” Plain said. “The dairy
guys are probably going to still struggle with too large herds
and too much milk.”  
 Calf Crop Falls  
 The 2010 calf crop fell 1.2 percent to 35.4 million head,
compared with a 1.1 percent decline estimated by analysts.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.325 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 94.725 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The most-active contract has climbed 5.1 percent in
the past year. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose
0.275 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.15175 a pound.  
 The price of wholesale  choice beef , an indicator of demand
for the meat, rallied 12 percent this year through midday,
according to USDA data. The price was down 5.2 percent last
month, the second straight decline.
