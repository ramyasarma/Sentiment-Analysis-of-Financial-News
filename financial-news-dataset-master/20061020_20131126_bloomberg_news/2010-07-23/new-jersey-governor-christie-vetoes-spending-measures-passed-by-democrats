             New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
vetoed $132.1 million in supplemental spending on health care
and homebuyer tax credits that the Democratic-led Legislature
approved during deliberations on his $29.4 billion budget.  
 Christie vetoed three bills providing for $100 million in
homebuyer credits, $7.5 million in funding for women’s health-
care programs and $24.6 million for the  FamilyCare  insurance
program. The first-term Republican lowered spending by $10
billion in his first budget, which took effect July 1.  
 “State spending has been reset to levels the taxpayers can
afford, and supplemental spending that would return to the
unchecked spending and out-of-control budget shortfalls of the
past will not make it past the governor’s desk,” Christie said
today in his veto message to lawmakers.  
 Christie, a 47-year-old Republican who took office in
January, skipped a $3 billion pension payment and lowered aid to
schools and towns by $1.3 billion in his budget. The plan also
suspended property-tax rebates until next year, when the state
will owe $2.1 billion, according to an estimate by legislative
forecasters.  
 Democrats in the Senate and Assembly said they plan to push
for override attempts. They would need two-thirds of the votes
in the 80-member Assembly and 40-member Senate to override the
governor’s veto.  
 The homebuyer credit passed the Assembly 67-8 and the
Senate unanimously. The FamilyCare bill cleared the Senate 23-17
and the Assembly by 45-32 in votes that fell along party lines.
The women’s health measure passed the two houses 30-10 and 42-
22.  
 “This is a philosophical debate,” said Assemblyman  Louis Greenwald , a Democrat from Cherry Hill who sponsored the credits
and FamilyCare bills. “No one person in New Jersey should be
driving the agenda.”
