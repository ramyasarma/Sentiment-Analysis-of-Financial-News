             The pound extended advances versus
the dollar and the euro after data showed the economy grew
almost twice as much as economists forecast in the second
quarter.  
 The pound was 0.8 percent stronger at $1.5375 as of 9:31
a.m. in London and appreciated 0.4 percent to 84.18 pence.  
 Gross domestic product rose 1.1 percent in the three months
through June after increasing 0.3 percent in the previous
quarter, the Office for National Statistics said today.
Economists forecast a 0.6 percent gain, according to the median
of 32 predictions in a Bloomberg news survey.
