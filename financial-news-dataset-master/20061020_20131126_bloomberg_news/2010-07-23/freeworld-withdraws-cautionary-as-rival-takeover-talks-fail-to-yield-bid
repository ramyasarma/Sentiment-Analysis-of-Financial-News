             Freeworld Coatings Ltd. said it is
withdrawing a cautionary announcement after talks with an
unidentified company about a rival takeover bid failed to yield
an offer.  
 Freeworld is of the view that the interest from the
unidentified company is tentative, it said. Freeworld is not in
possession of any “material price sensitive information”
regarding the competing bid to Saphirefield Investments’ offer,
it said.
