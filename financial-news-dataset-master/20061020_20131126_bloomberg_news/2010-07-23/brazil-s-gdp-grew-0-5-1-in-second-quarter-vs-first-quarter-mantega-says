             Brazil’s economy will grow 0.5
percent to 1 percent in the second quarter from the first three
months of the year, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said in an
interview.  
 Mantega, in an interview in Sao Paulo, said gross domestic
product expanded 7 percent in the second quarter from the year
ago period. Growth in Latin America’s biggest economy will slow
to an annual 5.5 percent pace by the fourth quarter, a level
“that doesn’t produce inflation,” he said.
