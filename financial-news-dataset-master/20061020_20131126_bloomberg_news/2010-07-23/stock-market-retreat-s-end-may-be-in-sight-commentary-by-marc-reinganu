             Fear has been on the rise in equity
markets, reflecting concerns over sovereign debt, the
sustainability of the euro, slowing growth in China and
persistent high unemployment in the U.S.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has declined 10 percent
from this year’s high back on April 23. The  VIX , an index of
stock volatility that reflects investor fear, shot up to a level
of 45.79 on May 20 from just 15.58 on April 12. The depth of
this recession and the slow recovery, set against memories of
the breathtaking stock market declines in 2008 and 2009, raise
concerns that a rollercoaster-like double dip is next.  
 The good news is that the current market pullback needs to
be viewed as part of a normal correction in the broader context
of strong recoveries, not as the start of a new, deep plunge.
Since December 1925, I’ve identified six episodes when the U.S.
stock market experienced large declines.  
 In June 1932, the U.S. market had its most severe plunge,
losing more than 83 percent of its value from the peak during
the previous five years. The magnitude and length of time of
this decline have fortunately been unmatched since then.  
 But the market lows of 2009 come in second place in terms
of severity and length. The market fell by more than 51 percent
from its previous five-year peak, exceeding the 44 percent
decline after the tech bubble crash that started in March 2000
and the 46 percent decline in September 1974.  
 Market Recoveries  
 What happens after the market reaches these extreme,
multiyear market lows? In the first 12 months the stock market
rebounds by 64 percent on average, a number somewhat skewed by
the 156 percent surge from the June 1932 market low. Even the
smallest one-year rebound of 27 percent, following the September
2002 post-tech bubble bust, well exceeds the typical 12-month
return of the stock market. Clearly, strong one-year market
returns characterized stock markets following extreme plunges.  
 The story is similar five years after a major plunge, with
the stock market advancing by an average of 161 percent. Thus,
while the most dramatic stock market recoveries occur within the
first year, the next four years still produce very solid market
performance, and in none of these instances have investors come
out behind.  
 Against the backdrop of very positive market performance
over one- and five-year periods following market stumbles, the
stock market has always experienced pullbacks or corrections
during the first two years after a plunge.  
 Surrendering Gains  
 For example, in 1932 the market rallied by 102 percent in
just 61 days from its closing low; over the next 173 days, the
market then retreated 36 percent. While severe, this correction
didn’t surrender all the gains from the initial rally.  
 In  1974 , the market bottomed and rallied by 61 percent over
the next 285 calendar days. It then entered a correction stage
that lasted 78 days and declined by 14 percent.  
 In each of the five extreme stock market low episodes prior
to 2009, stocks backed off at least 10 percent from the initial
rally within the first two years. On average, the stock market
decline was 17 percent and occurred over 140 days.  
 So what might one expect in the current market environment?
On March 3, 2009, the U.S. stock market reached the lowest level
since September 1996. In the following 11 months the market rose
80 percent, making it one of the strongest and longest rallies
since 1925. The market peaked on April 23 before falling to its
latest low on July 1, a 16 percent fall.  
 While stocks have risen during the past three weeks, it’s
worth asking whether this market-correction phase is finished?  
 Predicting a Bottom  
 Perhaps not. After all, the shortest correction period
prior to this was 78 days. Still, the correction phase probably
will end sometime this summer based on past experiences.  
 Furthermore, the magnitude of potential stock market losses
in the future is likely to be much more limited than those that
occurred between April 23 and July 1.  
 Predicting an exact market bottom is always a tenuous
exercise, but past experience suggests that this type of dip,
common after extreme market lows, will not turn into another
plunge like that in 2008 and 2009.  
 For patient investors who have waited on the sidelines, the
coming few months may represent a very good opportunity to
increase holdings of equities as the outlook for the next
several years is solidly positive based on 85 years of market
history.
