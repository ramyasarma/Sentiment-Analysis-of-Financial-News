             Vodafone Group Plc , the world’s
biggest mobile-phone company, agreed to pay 1.25 billion pounds
($1.93 billion) to the U.K. to settle a lawsuit over taxation of
its European units based outside of Britain.  
 The deal with  U.K. Revenue & Customs  calls for 800 million
pounds to be paid in the current financial year with the rest to
be paid in installments over the next five years, Vodafone said
today in a statement about its first-quarter earnings.  
 Vodafone set aside 2.2 billion pounds to cover tax payments
and interest in the case, the company said last year after it
lost a Court of Appeal ruling. The dispute involved Vodafone’s
Luxembourg unit and Britain’s so-called Controlled Foreign
Companies laws relating to U.K. corporations that have units in
European Union countries with lower tax rates.  
 “No further U.K. CFC tax liabilities will arise in the
near future under current legislation,” Newbury, England-based
Vodafone said in the statement. “Longer term, no CFC
liabilities are expected to arise as a consequence of the likely
reforms of the U.K. CFC regime.”  
 HMRC spokesman Patrick O’Brien didn’t immediately return a
call for comment.
