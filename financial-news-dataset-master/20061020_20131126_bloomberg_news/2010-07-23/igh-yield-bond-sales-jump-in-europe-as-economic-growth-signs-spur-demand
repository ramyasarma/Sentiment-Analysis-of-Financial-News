             Cegedim SA , the French health-care
data provider, and can-maker Crown Holdings Inc. helped drive a
resurgence of high-yield bond sales as signs of economic
recovery spurred investor demand for the riskiest debt.  
 Companies issued $2.3 billion of speculative-grade notes
this week, almost half the $5.5 billion total for all borrowers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The tally takes junk-
bond sales this month to $7.3 billion, the most for the period
since companies raised $11.4 billion in November.  
 Junk-bond sales rose as data showed the  U.K. economy
expanded  by the most in four years and German business
confidence unexpectedly surged to a three-year high, easing
investor concern that the economic recovery may be faltering.
High-yield bond funds worldwide attracted inflows of $948
million in the week to July 21, according to EPFR Global, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm.  
 “It’s a good time for high-yield companies to take
advantage of investor appetite for new deals, buoyed by the
inflows into junk bond funds and improving economic
fundamentals,” said  Felix Freund , a Frankfurt-based portfolio
manager at Union Investment GmbH, which oversees 160 billion
euros ($207 billion) of assets.  
 Investor demand for riskier assets drove junk-bond yields
relative to government debt to the tightest since May, while the
cost of insuring high-yield company debt against default fell to
the lowest in two months.  
 High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 Spreads Narrow  
 The extra yield on junk-rated debt narrowed 16 basis points
this week to 725 basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings
dropped as much as 13 basis points to 500, the lowest since May
13, according to Markit Group Ltd. prices in London.  
 Cegedim  raised 300 million euros from its first bond issue,
selling five-year notes yielding 7.25 percent, Bloomberg data
show. The securities have risen in secondary market trading,
bringing the yield down to 6.94 percent, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc prices on Bloomberg. The Boulogne, France-based
company is rated BB+ at S&P, one step below investment-grade.  
 Crown European Holdings SA , a unit of the biggest U.S.
metal-can manufacturer, issued 500 million euros of eight-year
bonds yielding 7.125 percent, Bloomberg data show. The size was
boosted from 350 million euros, according to bankers involved in
the deal. The notes may be rated BB by S&P, two steps below
investment-grade, and an equivalent Ba2 at Moody’s.  
 DSG, DFS  
 DFS Furniture Co. Ltd. , the U.K. sofa maker bought by
private equity company Advent International Corp. earlier this
year, raised 240 million pounds ($370 million) from seven-year
notes. Meantime,  DSG International Plc , Britain’s biggest
electronics retailer, sold 150 million pounds of five-year high-
yield bonds at a yield of 9 percent.  
 Investment-grade companies issued 2.5 billion euros of debt
this week, a 56 percent drop from a week earlier, Bloomberg data
show. High-grade bond yield spreads narrowed 5 basis points this
week to 188, the tightest since May 19, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show.  
 Temasek Holdings Pte , Singapore’s state investment company,
led investment-grade sales, raising 700 million pounds from its
first benchmark issue in the U.K. currency.
