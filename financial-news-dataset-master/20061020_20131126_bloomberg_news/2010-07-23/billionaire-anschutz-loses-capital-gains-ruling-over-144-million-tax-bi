             Denver billionaire  Philip Anschutz 
lost a fight with the Internal Revenue Service over a $143.8
million personal and company tax bill for 2000 and 2001.  
 The  U.S. Tax Court  in Washington yesterday found that
Anschutz Co. was required to recognize built-in gains upon
entering into an agreement to sell shares to an investment bank,
while also lending the same shares to the bank.  
 Anschutz filed a petition after the IRS challenged his use
of 13 transactions that he claimed deferred capital gains taxes
related to his company’s merger of  Union Pacific Corp.  and
 Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  in 2000. The transactions being
challenged occurred from May 2000 to April 2001.  
 Anschutz Co. will appeal the court decision, the company
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  
 The company, acting on legal advice, determined the capital
gains taxes didn’t need to be paid until the agreements matured
and the transactions settled 10 to 11 years from the time they
were put in place, Anschutz Co. said.  
 The case tested a 2003 IRS ruling that pledging shares as
collateral for a so-called variable prepaid forward  contract 
doesn’t amount to a sale of assets for tax purposes.  
 A prepaid forward contract gives an investor an upfront
payment in exchange for delivery of an asset in the future. The
contracts have grown in popularity among corporate executives
looking to lock in stock gains while delaying tax.
