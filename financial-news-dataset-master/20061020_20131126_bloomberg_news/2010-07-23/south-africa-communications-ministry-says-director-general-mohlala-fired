             South Africa’s Communications
Ministry said the contract of Director-General Mamodupi Mohlala
was terminated today after “trust” between Minister Siphiwe
Nyanda and Mohlala had “broken down irretrievably.”  
 The department had faced “a number of challenges recently
relating to internal processes and procedure,” it said in an e-
mailed statement today. Harold Wesso has been appointed as
acting director general, the ministry said.
