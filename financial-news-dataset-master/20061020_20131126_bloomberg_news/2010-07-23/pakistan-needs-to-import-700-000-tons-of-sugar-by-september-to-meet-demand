             Pakistan  may need to import as much
as 700,000 metric tons of white sugar by September to help meet
demand and reduce domestic prices, according to an industry
trade group.  
 Existing stocks of 800,000 tons will only last till
September, Iskander Khan, Chairman of the  Pakistan Sugar Mills
Association  said in a telephone interview from Islamabad. “The
government will have to urgently import before stocks run out.”  
 Pakistan’s government may have to import sugar directly
from global exporters after the state-run Trading Corp. missed
its target to buy a total of 1.2 million tons by July because
suppliers delayed deliveries. Trading Corp. will complete the
procurement of 575,000 tons of sugar by November.  
 Finance Minister  Abdul Hafeez Shaikh  formed a panel on July
20 to determine how sugar can be procured without waiting for
Trading Corp. to invite bids and award contracts. Trading
Corp.’s import procedure takes 120 days because of government
rules aimed at ensuring rules are followed.  
 Domestic prices, which have risen over 50 percent to 66
rupees (77 cents) a kilogram in the past year, may climb further
as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches when demand is
higher, said  Fareed Qureshi , chairman of the Karachi Retail
Markets Association.  
 Pakistanis consume 350,000 tons of sugar a month and demand
rises by 30,000 tons in Ramadan which begins in August.
