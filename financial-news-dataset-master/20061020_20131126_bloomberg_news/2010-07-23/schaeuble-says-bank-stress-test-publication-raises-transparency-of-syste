             German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said banks’ broad participation in stress tests and
the publication of their results is an “important step” toward
raising confidence in financial markets.  
 “Transparency regarding the resilience of European banks
has clearly increased,” Schaeuble said today in an e-mailed
statement. “It’s a positive signal that all participating
German banks meet the regulatory requirements even in the
unlikely event of a severe slump in economic growth.”  
 Even under the most pessimistic assumptions, no German bank
would fall below the legal capital ratio of 4 percent, the
Finance Ministry said in a separate document. All German banks
apart from the “exceptional case” of  Hypo Real Estate Holding
AG  would have a capital ratio of more than 6 percent, it said.  
 The stress tests on Hypo Real Estate, the commercial-
property lender rescued by the government following the
financial crisis, don’t take into account the restructuring that
has already been implemented, which foresees the shifting of
assets to a wind-down unit and a “strengthening” of capital,
it said.
