             Magna International Inc., Canada’s
largest auto-parts maker, will eliminate its dual-class
structure and end founder  Frank Stronach ’s control of the
company after shareholders approved a reorganization plan.  
 Shareholders accepted the plan with about 93 percent of the
votes cast at a special meeting in Toronto, Magna said today.
The Aurora, Ontario-based company said about 75 percent of Class
A shares voted were in support. The plan is subject to court
approval at a hearing Aug. 12 and 13.  
 The deal gives the Stronach Trust, controlled by Stronach,
$970 million in cash and shares based on today closing price on
the New York Stock Exchange in return for ceding control of the
company he founded in 1969. Stronach, 77, did not attend the
meeting.  
 A majority of shareholders voted that this is “a good
deal,”  Mike Harris , a board member and chairman of the meeting,
told reporters as he left the venue. He declined to stay after
the meeting and answer questions.  
 Magna rose 79 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $74.45 at 4:04 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
jumped 47 percent this year.  
 While it was opposed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, which said the payout is excessive, Magna Chief Financial
Officer  Vince Galifi  said getting rid of the dual-class system
will eliminate the discount at which companies with multiple-
share structures trade.  
 Those Opposed  
 The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan cast its vote against
the deal and said today in a statement it will join other
shareholders to oppose it at the Ontario Superior Court of
Justice hearing next month. The pension fund holds one Magna
share.  
 “The proposed arrangement is excessive, unprecedented and
unfair to shareholders,” the fund said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The proposal was developed by a committee of independent
directors. It calls for the Stronach Trust to get 9 million new
Class A shares, or a 7.4 percent stake, for the Class B stock
that now gives it about 66 percent of voting rights. The trust
would also receive about $300 million in cash.  
 All Class B shareholders were represented at the meeting
and all voted for approval at 300 votes per share. About 80
percent of Class A shareholders were represented.  
 Magna will establish a joint venture with the trust to
develop electric vehicles and end a consulting arrangement with
Stronach.
