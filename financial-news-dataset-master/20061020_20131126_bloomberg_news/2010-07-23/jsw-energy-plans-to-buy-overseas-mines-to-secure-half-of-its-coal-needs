             JSW Energy Ltd. , an affiliate of
India’s third-largest steelmaker, plans to buy stakes in mines
overseas or negotiate long-term contracts to secure half of its
annual coal requirement.  
 The company based in Mumbai is seeking to purchase 3
million tons of coal a year to reduce the more expensive spot
purchases, Vice Chairman N.K. Jain told reporters in Mumbai
today.  
 JSW Energy, an affiliate of JSW Steel Ltd., plans to boost
its generation capacity more than ten-fold to 11,390 megawatts
by 2015, according to its  website.  The company acquired one
South African coal mine and has long-term contracts with
Indonesian mines that together supply the company the balance 3
million tons of coal it needs every year, Chief Financial
Officer  Pramod Menon  told reporters.  
 The company paid about $90 a ton for spot purchases of
coal before shipment costs from South Africa’s  Richards Bay 
during the quarter ended June 30, Jain said. JSW Energy has
2,790 megawatts of capacity expansion under construction, 90
percent of which will be coal-fired.  
 JSW Energy’s  shares , which have risen 29 percent this year,
gained 0.2 percent to 129.1 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai.  
 The company’s single biggest project is a 1,200-megawatt
coal-fired plant in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra state that should be
commissioned by the end of 2010, Jain said. The company is
considering using natural gas to supply a further 3,200-
megawatt expansion of the Ratnagiri plant, he said.  
 “We are examining the fuel security for this 3,200-
megawatt expansion,” Jain said. “We are looking if gas is
available.”
