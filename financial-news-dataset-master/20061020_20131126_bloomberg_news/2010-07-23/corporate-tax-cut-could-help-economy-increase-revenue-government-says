             Japan’s government said a decline in
corporate tax rates doesn’t necessarily reduce tax  revenue , as
Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s administration examines reducing the
levy to spur  economic growth .  
 Countries with an effective corporate tax burden between 20
percent and 30 percent have a higher revenue to  gross domestic
product  ratio than nations who charge more than 40 percent, the
Cabinet Office said in an annual report released today, citing
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data.  
 The government pledged in its medium-term economic plan
released last month to bring the corporate tax rate down to a
level “commensurate” with other leading nations to spur growth.
At around 40 percent, Japan’s corporate tax rate is among the
highest in the OECD.  
 Countries with lower tax rates may enjoy a higher share of
revenue because a smaller levy stimulated economic growth or
they broadened the tax base, the report said, citing research.  
 Companies in Tokyo pay a levy, including local taxes, of
40.7 percent. The burden is higher than China’s 25 percent,
Seoul’s 24.2 percent and France’s 33.3 percent, Finance Ministry
data show. The OECD’s average is around 26 percent.
