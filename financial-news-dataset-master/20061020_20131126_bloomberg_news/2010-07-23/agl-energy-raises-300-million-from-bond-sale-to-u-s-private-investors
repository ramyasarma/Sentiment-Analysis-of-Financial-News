             AGL Energy Ltd. , Australia’s largest
electricity retailer, said it raised $300 million from its first
sale of bonds to U.S. private investors.  
 The Sydney-based company sold $165 million of 12-year notes
that it will swap back to Australian-dollar debt paying a margin
of 259 basis points more the bank bill swap rate, according to a
regulatory filing.  
 It also sold $135 million of 15-year bonds, paying a spread
of 254 basis points once the proceeds are exchanged for
Australian dollars, the filing said. AGL will use the funds to
repay bank loans, it said.
