             Chile’s peso completed the biggest
weekly gain since May, outperforming other Latin American
currencies, on higher prices of copper, the country’s biggest
export, and expectations of rising  interest rates .  
 Chile’s currency gained 1.9 percent this week, touching an
11-week high of 517 per U.S. dollar. It fell 0.2 percent to
520.28 today from 519.2 yesterday.  
 The Chilean peso outperformed the other six regional
currencies tracked by Bloomberg this week as copper climbed 8.8
percent and traders priced in higher borrowing costs as
transport, energy and food prices rose. Chile will sell $1
billion of bonds in dollars after meetings with investors in the
U.S. next week, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said yesterday.  
 “The news in general has been supportive of the Chilean
peso,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. “You had the debt
news and copper outperformed.”  
 The one-year interest-rate swap rate was unchanged today
after rising for nine straight days to 3.54 percent, the highest
since February 2009. One-year breakeven inflation was unchanged
at 4.3 percent, up from 3.69 percent at the end of June.  
 The peso weakened today as the euro slid as much as 0.8
percent after the European Union’s bank stress tests failed to
ease concern about the region’s lenders.  
 “It didn’t break the 517 technical level yesterday and
there was a decline in the euro today,” said  Luis Morales , a
currency trader at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in Santiago.
