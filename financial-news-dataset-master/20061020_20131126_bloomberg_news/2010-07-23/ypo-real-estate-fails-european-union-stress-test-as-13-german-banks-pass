             Hypo Real Estate Holding AG , the
commercial-property lender rescued by the government following
the financial crisis, was the only one among 14 German banks to
fail a European Union-wide stress test.  
 Hypo Real Estate’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, dropped to 4.7 percent in a test scenario
that simulated a sovereign-debt crisis and economic recession,
below the 6 percent minimum required, the Bundesbank and
Germany’s financial regulator, BaFin, said in a joint statement.
The bank would only have to raise capital “if the hypothetical
stress scenario actually did materialize,” they said.  
 EU regulators have carried out the region’s first
orchestrated stress tests as they seek to reassure investors
about the firms’ resilience to potential losses amid a crisis
that has pummeled the bonds of countries such as Greece, Spain
and Portugal. The tests, coordinated by the  Committee of
European Banking Supervisors , assessed 91 of Europe’s biggest
banks. Seven of the lenders didn’t pass, CEBS said today.  
 “Had Hypo Real Estate not failed the test, this would have
meant the stress tests would have been a real joke,” said  Dirk Becker , a Frankfurt-based analyst at Kepler Capital Markets.
“The bank is under reconstruction anyway and will be
recapitalized by the German government, so this doesn’t really
matter for the market.”  
 Would Have Passed  
 Hypo Real Estate would have passed the test if it had
received all the capital it requested from Germany’s Soffin
bank-rescue fund, the Munich-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement following the publication of the results.  
 “Given full recapitalization, Hypo Real Estate would
exceed the 6 percent Tier 1 ratio for all scenarios used in the
current stress test,” the company said. The bank said it has
applied for a 10 billion-euro ($12.8 billion) recapitalization,
of which 7.87 billion euros have been approved.  
 Deutsche Bank AG ,  Commerzbank AG  and Deutsche Postbank AG,
Germany’s biggest publicly traded banks, all passed the test.
Deutsche Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio dropped to 9.7 percent in
the most severe scenario, while Commerzbank’s and Postbank’s
fell to 9.1 percent and 6.6 percent respectively.  
 “Over the last two years, the German banks have undertaken
considerable efforts to clean up their balance sheet and to
obtain capital injections from owners and government bodies,”
BaFin and Bundesbank said today. The average Tier 1 capital
ratio under the sovereign-shock scenario was 8.2 percent.  
 Banking Association  
 Germany’s BdB banking association, which represents more
than 220 private lenders such as Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank,
said the publication of the stress tests will help calm markets
and boost trust.  
 Germany’s state-owned lenders, or Landesbanken, all passed.
Bayerische Landesbank and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg had Tier
1 capital ratios of 8.8 percent and 8.1 percent. Norddeutsche
Landesbank, which hasn’t received state aid during the financial
crisis, had the second-lowest ratio among the tested German
lenders with 6.2 percent in the most severe case.  
 Landesbank Berlin Holding AG , which also didn’t need any
government help during the financial crisis, had the best ratio
of all 14 tested German lenders with 11.2 percent.  
 HSH Nordbank AG’s and  WestLB AG ’s ratios were 9.7 percent
and 7.1 percent. Both needed state aid to stem losses and dump
toxic assets during the financial crisis. Stuttgart-based LBBW,
the country’s biggest state-owned lender, also received 5
billion euros ($6.4 billion) of capital. BayernLB in Munich
needed 10 billion euros in fresh funds.  
 ‘Not Transparent’  
 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn 
said yesterday the union has the means to fix any problems that
may be found in the tests. Ailing lenders should first seek
funding from their shareholders and the markets before seeking
help from national rescue funds, Rehn said.  
 The 54-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index has dropped 3.9 percent this year amid the debt crisis.  
 “This stress test is not transparent and it will rather
add to uncertainty in the market because of its various
adjustments and the way the banks that were tested have been
selected,” said  Klaus Fleischer , professor for banking and
finance at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich.
“Therefore, the test results are not very credible.”  
 The following table shows the results of all German banks
that were tested, as published by BaFin and the Bundesbank.
