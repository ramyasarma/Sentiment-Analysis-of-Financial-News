             U.S. stocks rose, extending a weekly
gain, as better-than-estimated earnings at companies from Ford
Motor Co. to Verizon Communications Inc. overshadowed concern
about Chinese loan losses and European bank stress tests.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1 percent to
1,094.79 at 10:40 a.m. in New York after slumping as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 23.5
points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,345.8.
