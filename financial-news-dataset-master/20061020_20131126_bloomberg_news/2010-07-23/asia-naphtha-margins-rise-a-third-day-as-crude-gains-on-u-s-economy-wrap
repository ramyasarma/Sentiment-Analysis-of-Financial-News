             The refining margins from making
naphtha in Asia rose for a third day after crude oil surged to
the highest close in 11 weeks on optimism that the U.S. economy
is recovering.  
 Naphtha’s discount  to Dubai crude narrowed to $4.28 a
barrel at 10:05 a.m. Singapore time from $5 a barrel yesterday,
according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates. August swap
contracts for  naphtha  gained the most among oil products, rising
$3.06 to $71.42 a barrel.  
 Oil jumped 3.6 percent yesterday as stocks rallied after
EBay Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. earnings beat estimates and
growth accelerated in European manufacturing and services.  
 Gasoil processing profits  gained 46 cents to $12.45 a
barrel against Dubai crude after  gasoil  swaps increased $2.80 to
$88.15 a barrel.  
 Refining losses from making  fuel oil  widened 61 cents to a
discount of $4.82 a barrel against the Middle Eastern crude
grade.  Fuel oil  swaps rose $11.25 to $460.75 a metric ton,
making it the product that gained the least, on concern that
global stockpiles are relatively high.  
 Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co. shut its naphtha cracker
at Daesan complex in South Korea after a thunderstorm disrupted
power supply, a company official said. The 850,000 metric ton-a-
year plant was shut around 10 a.m. local time today and may
resume operation in about one or two days.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the first
half of September were bid at $656.50 a ton against offers at
$659.50 at 9:36 a.m., according to data from Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte.  
 Naphtha  for delivery in September closed at $644 a ton
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
