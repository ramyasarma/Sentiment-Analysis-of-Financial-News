             Australia is leading Pakistan by 45
runs at lunch on the third day of the second Test as Michael
Clarke’s 76 helped steady the batsmen at Headingley in Leeds.  
 Australia will start the afternoon session on 215-5. It
started the day trailing by 34 runs, and lost the wickets of
captain Ricky Ponting (66), Michael Hussey (8) and Marcus North
(0). Mohammad Aamer took all three.  
 Australia was all out for 88 runs in its first innings,
while Pakistan reached 258.  
 Australia had won the toss and decided to bat, having taken
the first match in the two-game series by 150 runs.  
 The series is being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
