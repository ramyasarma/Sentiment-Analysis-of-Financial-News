             Canada’s annual  inflation rate 
slowed in June as gasoline prices fell for the first time since
October 2009 while the costs of home upkeep and car insurance
advanced.  
 The  consumer price index  rose 1 percent, the slowest in
seven months, after a 1.4 percent gain in May, Statistics Canada
said today. The core rate that  excludes eight volatile items 
slowed to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent. Economists forecast the
inflation rate would be 1 percent and the core rate 1.9 percent,
according to the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  
 Overall and core inflation will advance at about a 2
percent pace through 2012 as the economy returns to full
capacity after last year’s recession, Bank of Canada Governor
 Mark Carney  said yesterday. The bank’s forecast anticipates a
“gradual” rise in interest rates to keep inflation at that
pace, Carney said.  
 “There is spare capacity still to be absorbed in the
Canadian economy,” and that’s holding down inflation, said
 Jonathan Basile , a Credit Suisse economist in New York.  
 The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to C$1.0393 per
U.S. dollar at 7:48 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0371
yesterday. One dollar buys 96.22 U.S. cents.  
 Clothing Prices  
 Retail gasoline prices fell 2.9 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with a 6.9 percent increase the previous
month, Statistics Canada said. Clothing and footwear prices fell
1.8 percent. Automobile insurance premiums rose 5.3 percent, and
car prices rose 2.8 percent.  
 Homeowner replacement costs rose 5.2 percent in June, the
report said. Food prices rose 0.7 percent from a year ago, the
least since March 2008. Restaurant food rose 1.8 percent and
food purchased at stores rose 0.1 percent.  
 The Bank of Canada said yesterday that “harmonized” sales
taxes in Ontario and British Columbia that took effect July 1
will boost inflation by 0.6 percentage point from July to June
2011. The bank said this week that inflation would average 1.4
percent in the second quarter and 2.1 percent in the third
quarter.  
 Loblaw Cos. Ltd., Canada’s biggest grocery chain, will
focus on increasing sales volume because prices have been
declining and it’s “difficult to predict when inflation will
return to the market,” President  Allan Leighton  said on an
earnings call yesterday.  
 Breakeven Rates  
 Investors are demanding less of a premium against the risk
of rising consumer prices, with the so-called  breakeven  rate on
10-year bonds at 2 percent yesterday. The measure of what
investors predict for consumer price inflation over that period
fell to 1.85 basis points July 6, the lowest since at least July
2009 according to Bloomberg data.  
 The economy will return to full output at the end of next
year, Carney said yesterday. The bank on July 20 raised its key
rate for a second month to 0.75 percent, and trimmed its Canada
growth forecast for this year to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent.
The economy will grow 2.9 percent in 2011 and 2.2 percent in
2012, the bank said.  
 On a monthly basis, both overall and core consumer prices
fell 0.1 percent in June. Both those measures had advanced by
0.3 percent in the previous two months. Economists predicted
that monthly prices would be little changed in June, and the
core rate would be 0.1 percent.
