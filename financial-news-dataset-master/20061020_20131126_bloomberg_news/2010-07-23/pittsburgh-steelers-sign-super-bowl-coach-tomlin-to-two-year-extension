             The Pittsburgh Steelers signed
coach  Mike Tomlin  to a two-year extension through the 2012
season, according to the team’s  website .  
 The deal also includes a team option for the 2013
season. Financial details weren’t disclosed.  
 Tomlin, 38, led the Steelers to the Super Bowl
championship after the 2008 season, his second year in
charge of the National Football League team. He has a
career regular-season coaching record of 31-17.  
 The Steelers failed to make the postseason last year,
and will be without quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  for the
first six games of this season. Roethlisberger was
suspended by the league after a series of off-the-field
legal problems.
