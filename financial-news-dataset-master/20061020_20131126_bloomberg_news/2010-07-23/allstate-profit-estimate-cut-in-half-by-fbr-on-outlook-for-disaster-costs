             Allstate Corp. , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, had its second-quarter profit
estimate cut by more than half by FBR Capital Markets on
catastrophe costs from storms in the U.S. Midwest.  
 The estimate for Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate was
reduced to 61 cents a share from $1.26, FBR said today in a
 report  posted on its website. The insurer’s catastrophe losses
for the period may be $550 million to $1.1 billion, FBR said.  
 Travelers Cos. and  Chubb Corp. , both property and casualty
insurers, posted profit declines yesterday on costs from the
storms. An Oklahoma hailstorm cost the industry about $800
million, FBR said in the report. Allstate, which reports
earnings on Aug. 4, may say  profit  was 89 cents a share, the
average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “Catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable and will
undoubtedly mask the company’s true earnings power” in the
second quarter, FBR analysts  Bijan Moazami  and  Daniel Lee  wrote
about Allstate in the report.  
 Allstate rose  22 cents to $28.28 at 4:30 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, and has declined 5.9 percent
this year.  
 Maryellen Thielen , an Allstate spokeswoman, declined to
comment.
