             New York  Governor  David Paterson 
said he will call an extraordinary session of the state
Legislature for July 28 to consider measures to complete the
spending plan for the fiscal year that began April 1.  
 “The state budget is 15 weeks late, we have yet to close
our $9.2 billion current-year deficit or reduce our out-year
gaps,” said  Morgan Hook , Paterson’s spokesman, in an e-mailed
news release. “New Yorkers cannot afford to wait any longer.”  
 The Senate’s Democratic majority accepted the governor’s
action, said spokesman  Austin Shafran , who described it as a
“positive indicator that he is willing to negotiate a fair and
responsible budget with the legislative leaders.”  
 With its Legislature adjourned, the nation’s third-biggest
state by population lacks a completed budget. Lawmakers and the
governor have enacted a $135 billion spending plan without
enough revenue to fill the $9.2 billion gap. The imbalance may
worsen if Congress rejects extra Medicaid funding that would
send about $1 billion to New York this year, Hook said.  
 Without a revenue bill to pay for the spending plans, a
projected cash squeeze in September would become worse, the
governor has said.  
 The governor and Legislature must resolve their difference
over a “contingency plan” in the event Congress denies the
increased Medicaid reimbursement, Shafran said. Paterson and
members of the Legislature also differ on the size of tuition
increases they’d allow for state universities and on whether to
grant homeowners property tax relief, he said.  
 “The Speaker has repeatedly stated that if there was work
to be done, we would come back,” said Sisa Moyo, spokeswoman for
Assembly Speaker  Sheldon Silver , a Manhattan Democrat.  
 “We’ll be here and we think it’s important to get the
budget done,” said Scott Reif, a spokesman for Senate Minority
Leader  Dean Skelos , a Republican from Rockville Centre. “We
think the Democrats should have come back here on their own.”
