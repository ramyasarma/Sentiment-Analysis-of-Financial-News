             Crude oil dropped after approaching
an 11-week high, on speculation that rising U.S. inventories
will signal that prices have risen too fast.  
 Oil has gained 3.7 percent this week as global stock
markets rallied on growing optimism about the world’s economy.
Prices may fall next week on speculation that U.S. inventories
will climb as imports increase, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Tropical Storm Bonnie is forecast to move into the Gulf of
Mexico, according the  National Hurricane Center .  
 “We are now at the upper end of the trading range and
should come off, unless something unexpected happens,” said
 Carsten Fritsch , a Commerzbank AG analyst in Frankfurt.
“Fundamentals still look pretty poor and don’t justify prices
close to $80.”  
 Crude for September delivery dropped as much as 51 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $78.79 a barrel, in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $78.85 at 1:04 p.m. in
London. Yesterday, the contract rose as high as $79.42, the
highest price since May 5, as stock markets advanced.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange traded at $77.39, down 43 cents.
Yesterday, the contract jumped $2.45, or 3.3 percent, to $77.82,
the highest settlement since June 25.  
 The U.S. Energy Department said on July 21 U.S. crude
 stockpiles  grew by 360,000 barrels last week. Gasoline
inventories climbed 1.12 million barrels to 222.2 million
barrels, the highest level since April.  
 Thirteen of 34 analysts, or 38 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 30. Eleven respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and 10 saw an
increase. Last week 39 percent of analysts forecast a drop.  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie hit the Bahamas and was on a track to
take it across or near southern Florida and into the Gulf of
Mexico, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  
 The Gulf accounts for about 31 percent of U.S. oil output
and 10 percent of its natural-gas production, according to the
Energy Department. The coast along Louisiana and Texas is home
to 42 percent of U.S. refining capacity.  
 “The tropical storm should keep oil prices bubbling today
if it continues to strengthen and remain on track,”  David Hufton , managing director of London’s PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
said in a note. “The stock markets are a different matter. They
will certainly bubble but there may be some evaporation as the
day progresses.”  
 European stocks rallied for a fourth day and U.S. futures
gained as economic reports showed improvement in Britain and
Germany. The  Stoxx Europe 600  Index gained 0.4 percent as of
1:06 p.m. in London. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures rose
0.4 percent.
