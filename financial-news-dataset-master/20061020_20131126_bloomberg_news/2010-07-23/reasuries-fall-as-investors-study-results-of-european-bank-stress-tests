             Treasuries  fell, pushing up two-year
yields from a record low, as stocks rose after Genzyme Corp.
received a takeover approach and the euro gained after 84 of 91
European banks passed stress tests, fueling risk appetite.  
 U.S. bonds earlier erased losses on speculation the stress
tests may not prove that European lenders are strong enough to
weather a government default. The U.S. prepared to sell $104
billion in bonds next week.  
 “We’ve been trading with stocks,” said  Richard Bryant ,
senior vice president in fixed income at MF Global Inc. in New
York, a broker of exchange-traded futures. “We’re through the
stress tests, and now we have supply next week.”  
 The two-year  note  yield rose 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.58 percent at 4:25 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. It earlier dropped to a
record 0.5516 percent. The 0.625 percent security due in June
2012 fell 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 3/32.  
 The 10-year note  yield  rose 6 basis points to 2.99 percent.
It touched 2.85 percent on July 21, the lowest since April 2009.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,102.66 at 4 p.m. in New York, its first gain above 1,100 since
June 22. The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2915.  
 Treasuries reversed earlier losses after a draft document
showed Europe’s stress tests were set to ignore the majority of
banks’ holdings of sovereign debt after regulators decided
against testing securities held in their banking books. Banks
were only examined on European sovereign-debt losses for the
bonds they trade, it showed.  
 Trading Book Only  
 “The haircuts are applied to the trading book portfolios
only, as no default assumption was considered,” the European
Central Bank said in a confidential document July 22 titled “EU
Stress Test Exercise: Key Messages on Methodological Issues.”  
 Lenders hold about 90 percent of their Greek government
bonds in their banking book and 10 percent in their trading
book, according to a survey by Morgan Stanley analysts led by
 Huw van Steenis .  
 “It should have been completely across the full book, given
how intertwined the banking system in Europe is,”  George Goncalves , New York-based head of interest-rate strategy at
primary dealer Nomura Holdings Inc., said. The firm is one of 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “The fact
that the assumptions were different for the held-to-maturity
portfolio along with low capital raise needs is why the U.S.
bond market is being skeptical.”  
 The Committee of European Banking Supervisors said the
seven banks that failed the tests had a combined capital
shortfall of 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion). The seven were
Germany’s Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of
Greece SA and five Spanish savings banks.  
 ‘Hard to Determine’  
 “It’s hard to determine what exactly the stress tests mean
and how good of a gauge they are in telling you the health of
the European banking sector,” said MF Global’s Bryant.  
 Treasuries fell earlier today after U.K. GDP rose 1.1
percent in the three months through June following a 0.3 percent
increase in the previous quarter, the Office for National
Statistics said. Economists forecast a 0.6 percent gain,
according to the median in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The Ifo institute said its German business climate index
jumped to 106.2, the highest since July 2007, from 101.8 in
June, the biggest monthly increase since records for a reunified
Germany began in 1990.  
 While U.S. economic reports over the past month were weaker
than some analysts projected, 10-year notes were still poised
for a weekly loss amid optimism corporate earnings and a law
extending payments to the unemployed would maintain growth.
Technical considerations also point to Treasury declines,
according to primary dealer Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 ‘Coming to an End’  
 “There are growing signs in the technicals that the
honeymoon in Treasuries is coming to an end for the near-term,”
 William O’Donnell , managing director at RBS Securities in
Stamford, Connecticut, wrote in a note to clients. “I see signs
of brewing bearish divergence in the charts of all benchmark
Treasury securities -- save for the 30-year bond.”  
 The 10-year yield will climb to 3.30 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest
weightings.  
 Ten-year yields rose 6 basis points yesterday, the most in
more than a week.  Microsoft Corp.  posted its biggest sales gain
in 2 1/2 years, and AT&T Inc., United Parcel Service Inc. and
EBay Inc. also beat earnings estimates.  
 President  Barack Obama  signed an extension for jobless
benefits into law yesterday, granting $34 billion of extra
payments to the unemployed.  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed a 33 percent
chance policy makers will boost the  target lending rate  for
overnight bank loans at least a quarter-percentage point by
April, compared with a 55 percent likelihood a month ago.  
 The Treasury will auction $38 billion in two-year notes,
$37 billion of five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year
securities over three days next week starting July 27.
