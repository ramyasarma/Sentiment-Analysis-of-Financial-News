             German stocks advanced, erasing
earlier losses, as shares of Adidas AG climbed.  
 The benchmark DAX Index rose 0.4 percent to 6,164.54 at
9:42 a.m. in Frankfurt after earlier falling as much as 0.5
percent.  
 Adidas advanced 4.1 percent to 43.35 euros after the
world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker reported quarterly
net income that beat analysts estimates.
