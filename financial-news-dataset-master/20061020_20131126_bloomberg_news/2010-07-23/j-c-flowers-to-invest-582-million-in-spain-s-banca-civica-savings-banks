             J.C. Flowers & Co., a U.S. buyout
firm, agreed to purchase 450 million euros ($582 million) of
convertible bonds from Banca Civica, helping the group of
Spanish savings banks to raise capital after a law change.  
 The bonds, convertible into shares, will yield 7.5 percent
interest, less than the 7.75 percent charged for support funds
from the government’s bank rescue fund, Banca Civica said in an
e-mailed statement. J.C. Flowers’ decision to buy the securities
is linked to plans to trade Banca Civica shares on the bourse,
the group said. The buyout firm would be required to convert its
bonds within two years of the shares starting to trade.  
 The agreement is the first reached after Spain earlier this
month approved a change to its law governing savings banks,
allowing them to sell shares with voting rights to give them
more instruments to raise capital, Banca Civica said. The
Committee of European Banking Supervisors and national
regulators will start publishing the results of stress tests on
European banks, including 27 Spanish banks or lender groups,
from 6 p.m. Brussels time today.  
 Banca Civica is a grouping of the Caja Navarra, Caja de
Burgos and CajaCanarias savings banks.  
 J.C. Flowers is in talks with Kent Reliance Building
Society to create a joint company which will seek to acquire
other customer-owned lenders in the U.K., two people with
knowledge of the situation said this month.
