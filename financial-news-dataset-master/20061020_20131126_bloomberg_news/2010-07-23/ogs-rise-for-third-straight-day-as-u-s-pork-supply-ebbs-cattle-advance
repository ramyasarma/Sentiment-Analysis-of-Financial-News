             Hog futures rose for the third
straight day after a government report showed U.S. pork
inventories plunged the most in 14 years. Cattle also gained.  
 Frozen-pork stockpiles fell 29 percent in June from a year
earlier, the government said yesterday after livestock markets
closed. Pork production in the six months ended June 30 was 3.5
percent less than a year earlier as losses in 2008 and 2009
spurred farmers to cut herds.  Wholesale pork , known as the
cutout, climbed to a seven-week high yesterday.  
 “The cold-storage report is what’s helping us out, and
better pork cutouts” boosted futures, said  Paul Beere , a market
adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin. “We’re killing less hogs and we have a lot less pork
supplies, so you can have the price appreciating somewhat.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.625 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 77.025 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. This week, the most-active contract climbed 1.8
percent. The price has gained 37 percent in the past 12 months.  
 The decline in inventories was the biggest since at least
1996, and drops in pork and beef supplies are “positive for the
entire protein sector,”  Ken Goldman , an analyst for JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in New York, said in a report.  
 Beef Supplies  
 Warehouses held 375.3 million pounds of beef in June, down
14 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture report.  
 Rising spot prices for cattle signal beef demand is
improving, Prime Agricultural Consultants’ Beere said.  Steers 
for immediate delivery to slaughterhouses averaged 94.79 cents a
pound in the first four days of this week, up 1.5 percent from
last week, according to the USDA.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.325 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 94.725 cents a pound. The price advanced 1.2 percent
this week, the sixth straight weekly gain. Feeder-cattle futures
for August settlement climbed 0.275 cent, or 0.2 percent, to
$1.15175 a pound.  
 Cattle futures pared gains on speculation that the U.S.
feedlot herd is increasing. Feedlots purchased 1.628 million
young cattle last month, up 17 percent from a year earlier, the
USDA reported after markets closed. Twelve analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey expected a 19 percent jump, on average.
