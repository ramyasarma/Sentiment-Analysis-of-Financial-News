             Germany’s talks with Liechtenstein
will continue to be “full of trust and constructive” even as
state authorities consider purchasing a CD with stolen tax data
that originates in the principality, Finance Ministry spokesman
Michael Offer said.   
 “No additional burden will arise from this case,” Offer
told reporters today in Berlin.
