             Aircraft and aero-engine makers are
finding it tough to reach agreement on standards governing when
it’s safe to fly through volcanic ash clouds, the Wall Street
Journal reported.  
 European and U.S. aerospace companies at Britain’s
Farnborough air show called for further studies yesterday and
urged pilots to avoid “visible ash,” in the absence of
reliable on-board detection systems, the newspaper said.  
 Three months after ash from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull
volcano temporarily shut four fifths of European air space, a
study of two turboprop engines by Honeywell International Inc.
suggests that there may have been a greater hazard to some
engines than previously suspected, the Journal said, citing
industry officials.  
 Honeywell has so far declined to discuss what it found, the
newspaper added.
