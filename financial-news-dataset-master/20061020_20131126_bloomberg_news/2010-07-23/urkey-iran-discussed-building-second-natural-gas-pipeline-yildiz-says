             Turkey and Iran discussed building a
second natural-gas pipeline between the two countries, Turkish
Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said today.  
 The talks took place during a visit to Ankara yesterday by
Iran’s Oil Minister  Masoud Mir-Kazemi , Yildiz told reporters.
Any pipeline would be built by private companies and Turkey
wouldn’t be a partner, he said.  
 A pipeline with annual capacity of 10 billion cubic meters
supplies Turkey with Iranian gas. The link was damaged in a July
21 explosion officials blamed on the separatist Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, or PKK.
