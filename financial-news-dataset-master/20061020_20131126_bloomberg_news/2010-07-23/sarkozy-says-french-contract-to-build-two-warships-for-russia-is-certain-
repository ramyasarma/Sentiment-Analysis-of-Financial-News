             French President Nicolas Sarkozy
said a Russian contract to build two warships at French
shipyards is “certain.”  
 “The contracts are being negotiated but the decision to do
it is certain,” Sarkozy told workers at STX Europe, the
shipbuilder in which the state took a 33 percent stake in 2008,
today.
