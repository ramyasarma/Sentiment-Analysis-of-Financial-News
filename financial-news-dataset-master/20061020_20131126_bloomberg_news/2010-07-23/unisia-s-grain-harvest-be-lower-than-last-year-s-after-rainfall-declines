             Tunisia’s 2010 grain harvest may be
less than last year’s as a result of a decline in rainfall, the
state-run  TAP news agency  said today, citing preliminary data.  
 “Farmers have harvested 480,000 tons of grain so far this
year, compared with 870,000 tons in the same period last year,”
TAP quoted Abdessalam Mansour, minister of agriculture, water
resources and fishing, as saying.  
 Officials in Tunisia’s Agriculture Union had predicted that
this year’s grain crop wouldn’t exceed 1.6 million tons,
compared with 2.5 million tons last year.
