             Societe Generale analysts turned
“short-term bearish” on the forint, according to an e-mailed
note today. SocGen said the Hungarian government seems “to
misunderstand the dynamics between the International Monetary
Fund and the European Union under the IMF program framework.”
Any government view that it can only negotiate with the EU “is
a basic mistake,” SocGen said. Ultimately, the IMF takes the
lead in providing guidelines for fiscal adjustment, SocGen’s
analysts said. In this context, yesterday’s vote for a new tax
on banks “may contribute to further damaging the dialogue with
the IMF and the EU as well as the credibility of government
policies.”
