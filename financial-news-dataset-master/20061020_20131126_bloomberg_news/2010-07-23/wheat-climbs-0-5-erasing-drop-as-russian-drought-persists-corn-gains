             Wheat futures rose as much as 0.5
percent to $5.9975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reversing an earlier loss 0.5 percent, as dry weather persists
in Russia, damaging crops.       
 September-delivery wheat was at $5.995 a bushel at 3:37
p.m. Singapore time, while December-delivery corn gained 0.5
percent to $3.9225 a bushel, erasing a 0.6 percent loss earlier.
Soybeans for November delivery were up 0.3 percent at $9.8225 a
bushel.
