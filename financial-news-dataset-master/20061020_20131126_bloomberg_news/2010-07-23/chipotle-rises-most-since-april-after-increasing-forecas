             Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. , the
burrito chain spun off from McDonald’s Corp. in 2006, climbed
the most in more than three months in New York trading after
raising its comparable-store sales forecast for the year.  
 Sales  at restaurants open at least a year probably will
rise in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range, the
Denver-based company said yesterday in a statement. That
compared with a previous forecast of mid-single-digit growth.  
 The chain, which operates more than 1,000 Mexican-themed
restaurants, has benefited as more customers start eating out
again following the U.S. economic slump. The chain also has
expanded overseas, opening its first location in London last
 quarter  and planning a French one for next year.  
 Profit  for the second quarter rose 31 percent to $46.5
million, or $1.46 a share, from $35.4 million, or $1.10, a year
earlier, the company said yesterday.  
 Chipotle rose $10.83, or 8.1 percent, to $143.99 at 10:36
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The gain is
the largest since April 22.
