             Africa can grow biofuel crops on a
“significant scale” without damaging food production or
natural habitats, researchers said.  
 A study of biofuel production in Senegal, Mali, Tanzania,
Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique found enough land is available to
“significantly” raise cultivation of sugar cane, sorghum and
jatropha for energy production without reducing food output,
the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, or FARA, said in
a  statement  today.  
 In less developed African countries, yields may be tripled
by “improved management practices,” potentially freeing up
land for energy crops, the researchers said. Farmers in Nigeria
produce about 1.8 metric tons of corn a hectare (2.47 acres),
less than half the world average and under a fifth of U.S.
yields, according to  data  from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  
 Biofuel production may prompt investments “that could
help unlock Africa’s latent potential and positively increase
food production,” Rocio Diaz-Chavez, a research fellow at
Imperial College London who led the study, said in the
statement.  
 Locally produced ethanol can be blended with fossil fuels
to reduce African dependence on energy imports, according to
the statement. Biodiesel to power electrical generators is “of
keen interest” in many areas because of challenges to the
power grid, FARA said.  
 FARA was set up by intergovernmental organizations and
national research institutes. The report was produced by FARA,
Imperial College London and CAMCO International Ltd. CAMCO is a
U.K. investor in emission-reduction projects.
