             Harry Winston Diamond Corp.  agreed
to buy back a 9 percent stake in the Diavik diamond mine in
Canada 16 months after selling it to  Kinross Gold Corp.   
 Harry Winston will pay $220 million, comprising $50 million
in cash, about 7.1 million Harry Winston common shares and a $70
million promissory note, Toronto-based Kinross said today in a
statement.  
 In March 2009, Kinross agreed to pay $150 million for the
22.5 percent interest in a Harry Winston joint venture that owns
40 percent of the mine. Diavik is operated by Rio Tinto Group,
which has the other 60 percent stake.  
 Kinross also said today it will sell to its 19.9 percent
equity stake in Harry Winston to third parties. The shares were
also acquired in March 2009.  
 Harry Winston dropped C$1.55, or 11 percent, to C$13 at
4:10 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The decline was the
biggest in percentage terms since April 20, 2009.  Kinross  rose 6
cents to C$17.05.
