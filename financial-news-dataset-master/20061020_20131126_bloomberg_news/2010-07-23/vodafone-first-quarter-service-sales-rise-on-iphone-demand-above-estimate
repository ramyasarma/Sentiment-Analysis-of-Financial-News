             Vodafone Group Plc, the world’s
largest mobile phone company, said today fiscal first-quarter
organic service revenue increased 1.1 percent to 10.6 billion
pounds as the company started offering Apple Inc.’s iPhone
handset in the U.K. and other markets.  
 Analysts had estimated a decline of 0.4 percent after a
drop of 0.2 percent in the prior quarter. Vodafone commented in
an e-mailed statement today.
