             Minnesota Timberwolves General
Manager  David Kahn  was fined $50,000 by the National
Basketball Association for comments about marijuana use by
recently acquired forward  Michael Beasley .  
 The franchise also was fined $50,000, the NBA said
today in a news release.  
 Beasley’s past off-the-court problems included being
kicked out of the NBA’s rookie symposium in 2008 after
security found signs of marijuana use. He was sent to
Minnesota from Miami on July 12 for two second-round draft
picks and cash as the Heat freed salary-cap space to sign
free agents  LeBron James ,  Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh .  
 Kahn said in a radio interview with 1500 ESPN Twin
Cities that Beasley, 21, is a “very young and immature kid
who smoked too much marijuana and has told me that he’s not
smoking anymore,” according to ESPN.com.  
 An e-mail asking NBA spokesman  Tim Frank  whether
Kahn’s comments violated the league’s collective-bargaining
agreement with its players wasn’t immediately returned.
