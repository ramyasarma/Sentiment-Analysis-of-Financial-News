             The  Green Exchange LLC , an
emissions trading platform that operated within  CME Group Inc. ’s
New York Mercantile Exchange and counts  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  among its members, has won the approval
of U.S. regulators to operate independently.  
 The trading platform has been granted designated-contract-
market status, the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  said in
an e-mailed statement today. The exchange will offer “a broad
variety of contracts for environmental risk management that are
currently traded” on the Nymex, the CFTC said.
