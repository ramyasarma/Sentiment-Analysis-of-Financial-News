             The recovery in commodities may be
faltering as trading patterns are “throwing out bearish
signals,” Barclays Capital said.  
 The attached chart shows that the  Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index  of 19 raw materials has lost 9 percent since climbing to
this year’s peak of 293.75 in January. The  index  ended at 266.86
yesterday, below the 200-day average of 270.63, and was still in
the so-called “downtrend channel” described by Barclays.  
 While the index yesterday jumped to the highest closing
level since May 5, breaking the 100-day average, “it doesn’t
materially change our view” about the risk that prices may keep
declining,  Philip Roberts , European chief technical strategist
at Barclays, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg today. “To do that,
the price would have to recover above the 200-day average,” he
said in response to questions.  
 About 10 of the 19 raw materials in the index including
natural gas, aluminum, copper, oil and raw sugar have dropped
this year as economic expansion in China slowed, and investors
became more concerned about the pace of the U.S. recovery and
the resolution of Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “It is somewhat disappointing to see that the recovery,
which began in May, appears to be struggling,” Barclays said in
a July 20 report prepared by analysts including Roberts.  
 Raw sugar led declines among the raw materials in the index,
losing 32 percent, while natural gas fell 17 percent this year.  
 In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns to predict changes in prices.
