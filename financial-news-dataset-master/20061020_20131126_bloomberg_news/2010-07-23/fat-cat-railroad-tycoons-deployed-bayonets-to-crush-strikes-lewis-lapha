             Telling the newspapers his employees
would “cheerfully recognize” the need to reduce costs, John
Garrett, president of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, announced a
10 percent wage cut for workers on July 15, 1877, while also
approving a 10 percent dividend for shareholders. He was wrong.  
 Already suffering on less than half the pay they’d earned
just four years earlier, some rail workers walked off the job.
B&O had the leaders arrested, brought in strikebreakers and
called in the troops.  
 “The whole thing grows out of too much pay and speculation
among the head men,” wrote one paper. “Big salaries, wine
suppers, free passes and presents to Congressmen for their
votes.”  
 In solidarity, canal workers, miners and other laborers
joined the work stoppage, with angry crowds gathering in many
cities across the country. When militia and soldiers were
ordered to bayonet and fire on the demonstrators, killing
civilians, including women and children, this spontaneous labor
action kicked off the first national strike in U.S. history.  
 I spoke with  Michael Bellesiles , author of “ 1877:
America’s Year of Living Violently ” (New Press), on the
following topics:  
 1. The Great Strike  
 2. Crushing Workers  
 3. Terror of the Upper Class  
 4. First Red Scare  
 5. Stealing Elections
