             Yields on Mexico’s long-term peso
bonds fell for a third straight week, touching a record low, on
speculation slower-than-forecast consumer price increases will
keep the central bank from  raising interest rates .  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 6.85
percent, matching the all-time low reached on July 21, according
to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose 0.4
centavo to 128.73 centavos per peso.  
 A government report yesterday showed  consumer prices  rose
0.15 percent in the first half of July, slower than the 0.25
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Mexican
government bonds’ inclusion in Citigroup Inc.’s World Government
Bond Index in October also fueled investors’ demand for the
securities, said  Jimena Zuniga , a Latin America economist at
Barclays Capital in New York.  
 “Incoming data for inflation has been fairly benign,
supporting the idea that the central bank will be on hold for a
while,” said Zuniga. “There’s continued demand on the back of
the entry to the WGBI index. Our valuation models show the bonds
are rich.”  
 Mexico’s central bank last week kept its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 4.5 percent for an 11th straight meeting,
matching the bank’s longest pause, after consumer prices
declined for the past three months.  
 Mexico’s peso gained 1.6 percent this week to 12.7317 per
dollar. The peso has increased 2.6 percent in 2010, the second-
best performer among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
behind Japan’s yen.
