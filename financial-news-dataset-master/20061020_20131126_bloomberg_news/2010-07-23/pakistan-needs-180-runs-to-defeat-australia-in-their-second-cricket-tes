             Pakistan needs 180 runs to defeat
Australia and tie their two Test cricket series after bowling
out the opponents for 349 runs at Headingley in Leeds.  
 Australia got 77 runs from both Michael Clarke and Steven
Smith to build the 179-run lead after starting the day trailing
by 34. The pair helped settle the batting attack after
Pakistan’s Mohammad Ammer took the wickets of captain Ricky
Ponting (66), Michael Hussey (8) and Marcus North (0) in the
morning.  
 Australia was all out for 88 runs in its first innings,
while Pakistan reached 258. Australia had won the toss and
decided to bat, having taken the series’ first match by 150
runs.  
 The series is being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
