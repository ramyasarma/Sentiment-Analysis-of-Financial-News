Copper supplies probably lagged
behind demand by 250,000 metric tons to 300,000 tons so far this
year, against a balanced market in the first nine months last
year, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  “Forecasts for 2011 copper balances across market
participants have definitely shifted from being on average in
small surplus/balance to small-moderate deficit over the past
six months,” Macquarie said in a report dated Oct. 4. An
exchange-traded fund backed by copper metal may help prices to
“remain elevated or move higher,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
