Australia’s central bank will likely
lift interest rates when it meets on Oct. 5, as a mining boom
continues to stoke the nation’s economy, Australian newspaper
columnist  Terry McCrann  said.  The Reserve Bank of Australia “all but announced the rate
rise late yesterday afternoon when it posted its index of
commodity prices” that showed gains in iron ore, power-station
and steelmaking coal, McCrann said in his column published in
the Australian newspaper today. The lending rate is at 4.5
percent.  Manufacturing in China, Australia’s largest trading partner,
expanded at the fastest pace in four months in September. The
nation’s purchasing managers’ index climbed to 53.8 from 51.7 in
August, the logistics federation and statistics bureau said
yesterday. Readings above 50 indicate expansions.  Australia’s index of commodity prices is higher than the
peak it reached in 2008, when the cash rate was at 7.25 percent,
McCrann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
