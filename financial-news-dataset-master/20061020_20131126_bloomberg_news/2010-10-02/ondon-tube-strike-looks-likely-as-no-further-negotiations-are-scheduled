Two unions representing around 10,000
London Underground workers still plan to begin a 24-hour strike
tomorrow and haven’t scheduled formal talks with transportation
authorities, spokesmen for the groups said.  “No talks currently scheduled this weekend,” Geoff
Martin, a spokesman for the  Rail, Maritime and Transport Union ,
said today in an e-mailed reply to questions. “We remain
available, but action definitely on.”  Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association  spokesman Tom
Condon, and Lou Owen, a spokeswoman for ACAS, the U.K.’s state-
funded mediator, also said in phone interviews that no formal
talks are planned. Silka Kennedy-Todd, a  Transport for London 
spokeswoman, said authorities are planning on the basis that the
strike will go ahead.  The 24-hour strike over safety and staffing levels
threatens to disrupt travel for 3.5 million commuters on Monday,
Oct. 4. More than 100 additional buses, capacity for more than
10,000 extra river crossings and controlled taxi centers have
been organized for the strike period, according to  TFL’s
website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
