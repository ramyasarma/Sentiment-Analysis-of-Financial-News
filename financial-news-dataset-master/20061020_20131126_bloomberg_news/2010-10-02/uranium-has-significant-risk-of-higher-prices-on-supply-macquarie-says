Uranium has a “significant risk” of
higher prices if there are any supply disruptions, Macquarie
Group Ltd. said.  “We are increasingly of the view that we
have seen the bottom in prices,” now at about $45 to $48 a
pound, Macquarie said in a report dated Oct. 4. Prices have
started to climb because of producer buying, it said. “We would
expect flat to lower prices in the short term, and suggest this
will present itself in hindsight as a good buying opportunity,”
Macquarie said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
