J.K. Rowling , the world’s richest
author, told talk-show host Oprah Winfrey that she “could
definitely” write more books in the Harry Potter series.  The characters from the books “are still in my head,” she
told Winfrey in an  appearance  broadcast Oct. 1, according to the
show’s website.  “I’m not going to say I won’t,” Rowling said. “I loved
writing it. So I feel I am done, but you never know.”  The seventh and final book in the series,“Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows,” was released in July 2007, 10 years after
the first one. The publisher,  Bloomsbury Publishing Plc , will
release a redesigned series in November to coincide with the
movie, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
