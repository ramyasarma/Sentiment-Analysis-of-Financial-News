One in four hedge fund managers have
moved from London to Switzerland, at an annual cost to the U.K.
government of an estimated 500 million pounds ($791 million) in
tax revenue, the Financial Times reported.  Hedge fund managers are relocating to Switzerland because
of its stable tax system and to avoid “fiscal volatility and
political hostility” in the U.K., the FT said, citing
consultancy Kinetic Partners LLP.  The departures of  Alan Howard , founder of Brevan Howard
Asset Management LLP, Europe’s biggest hedge fund, and  Mike Platt  of BlueCrest Capital Management Ltd. will cost the
treasury 200 million pounds in lost revenue, the newspaper
reported, citing its own analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
