Saudi Arabian shares advanced for the
first time in four days as government and industry reports from
the U.S. and China fueled confidence in a global and Saudi
economic recovery.  The  Tadawul All Share Index   gauge  advanced 0.1 percent to
6,397.16 in Riyadh today. Banque Saudi Fransi, the Saudi lender

manufacturing accelerated in China in September.  “Generally, the Saudi market will react to more aggressive

investment analyst at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh. “It is lacking
much conviction whether to be bearish or bullish. Investors have
been positioning themselves for third-quarter earnings for the
last week or so.”  Banks Gain  U.S. stocks slipped, halting the longest streak of weekly
gains since April, as lingering concerns that Europe’s
government debt crisis may threaten the economic recovery. The
