The New York Yankees regained a half-
game lead in the American League East as their game at Boston
was rained out while the Tampa Bay Rays lost last night in
Kansas City.  The San Diego Padres stayed alive in the National League
West and NL wild-card races with a 6-4 win at San Francisco.
 Adrian Gonzalez  hit a three-run homer for the Padres, who faced
elimination from the playoff chase.  The victory moved the Padres within two games of the Giants
in the NL West and within one game of the Atlanta Braves, who
lost 11-5 at home against Philadelphia, in the wild-card race.
San Francisco and San Diego finish the season with two more
games against each other, while the Braves host the Phillies
today and tomorrow.  The Yankees and Red Sox will play a day-night doubleheader
today in Boston. The start of their game last night was delayed
for 3 hours, 23 minutes before it was postponed.  The Rays were held to two hits in a 7-0 loss to the Royals,
their second straight defeat in Kansas City. Both teams have
clinched playoff spots and are battling for the AL East crown
and home-field advantage in the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
