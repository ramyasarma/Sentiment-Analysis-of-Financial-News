President Dmitry Medvedev may choose
Deputy Prime Minister  Sergei Sobyanin  as the next mayor of
Moscow, Kommersant reported, without citing anyone.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin hosted members of the ruling
United Russia at his home near Moscow yesterday to discuss the
mayorship and Sobyanin was the only potential candidate who was
there, the Moscow-based newspaper said today.  Medvedev fired former Mayor Yury Luzkhov on Sept. 28 after
18 years at the helm of the country’s biggest city, citing
“loss of confidence.” Sobyanin himself is not keen on the idea
of succeeding Luzkhov, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
