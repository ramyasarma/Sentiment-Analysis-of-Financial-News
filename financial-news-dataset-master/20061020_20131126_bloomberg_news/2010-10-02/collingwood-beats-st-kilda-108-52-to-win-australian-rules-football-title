Collingwood beat St. Kilda by 56
points in the Australian Football League grand final replay to
win its first premiership since 1990.  The Magpies won 16.12 (108) to 7.10 (52) in front of a
crowd of 93,853 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Collingwood’s
15th premiership moves them within one of the record 16
Australian rules football championships shared by Carlton and
the Essendon Football Club.  “This is the best feeling I’ve ever had, let’s hope
there’s a few more to come,” Collingwood’s Scott Pendlebury
said in a televised interview with Channel Seven. He was awarded
the Norm Smith Medal for the grand final’s best player after
finishing with 29 possessions.  The Melbourne rivals were forced to return for a replay
seven days after tying 68-68 in the first drawn grand final
since 1977. The only other drawn championship game was in 1948.  St. Kilda, which beat Collingwood by one point in 1966 for
its only premiership win, failed in the final match of the
season for the second straight year following a 12-point defeat
to Geelong 12 months ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
