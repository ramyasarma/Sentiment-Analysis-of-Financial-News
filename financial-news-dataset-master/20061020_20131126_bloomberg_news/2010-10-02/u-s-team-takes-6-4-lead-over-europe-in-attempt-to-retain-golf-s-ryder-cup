The U.S. won three and tied one of
the six foursome matches to extend its lead over Europe to 6-4
after two sessions at golf’s Ryder Cup.  The American teams of Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker, Zach
Johnson and Hunter Mahan, and Stewart Cink and Matt Kuchar were
victorious in the foursome, or alternate shot, matches in
Newport Wales. The pairing of Padraig Harrington and Ross Fisher
and the team of Ian Poulter and Luke Donald had the Europe wins
in the session.  The U.S. won two and tied one of the four opening fourball
matches that were completed this morning following a seven-hour
rain delay yesterday.  The third session of two foursomes and four fourballs will
begin later today and will conclude tomorrow morning, before the
scheduled 12 singles matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
