Wigan got goals from Jordi Gomez and
Hugo Rodallega to defeat Wolves at home to move out of the
relegation zone of England’s top soccer division.  Gomez scored with a free kick in the 65th minute and
Rodallega took advantage of poor defending to grab the second in
85th minute. Wolves captain Karl Henry was dismissed in the
first half for an illegal challenge on Gomez.  The victory gives Wigan 8 points from 7 matches, pushing
the team into 10th place. Wolves drop into the relegation zone
in 18th place, with 5 points from 7 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
