International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  urged Ukraine not to pay cash to
settle a debt to RosUkrEnergo AG, a gas trader controlled by
Russian export monopoly OAO Gazprom and investor  Dmitry Firtash .  Paying cash will make it harder for Ukraine’s government to
keep its budget deficit below 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product next year, a target set by the IMF in a loan agreement,
Strauss-Kahn said today in the Black Sea resort city of Yalta.
RosUkrEnergo is owed about $3 billion, Strauss-Kahn said.  The Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal on June 8 ruled that
Ukraine’s state-run energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy owes
RosUkrEnergo 12 billion cubic meters of gas for fuel that was
wrongly confiscated under the government of  Yulia Tymoshenko ,
including penalties. Ukraine’s government asked the country’s
highest commercial court to overturn the decision and is waiting
for a ruling.  Russia’s government should be involved in settling the debt
if the Ukrainian court upholds the Stockholm body’s decision,
Strauss-Kahn said.  “I will meet with Russian Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin 
later today to discuss” the issue, Strauss-Kahn said, without
elaborating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
