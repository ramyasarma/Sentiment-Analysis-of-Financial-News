The  New York Times Co.  plans to pay
back a $250 million loan from Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim 
three years ahead of schedule, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The newspaper plans to pay back the loan to Slim by January
2012, earlier than the January 2015 maturity date,  Janet Robinson  told the Sunday Telegraph in an interview. The loan is
from Banco Inbursa and Inmobiliaria Carso, two companies
controlled by Slim, the Telegraph said.  Robinson also said the company would like to make digital
acquisitions when debt is lower and declined to give a timetable
for a purchase, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Robinson is traveling through Europe meeting advertisers,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
