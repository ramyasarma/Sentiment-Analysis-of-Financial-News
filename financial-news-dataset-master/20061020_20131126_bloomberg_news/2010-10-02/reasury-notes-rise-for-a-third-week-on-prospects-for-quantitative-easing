Treasuries  rose, pushing two-year
note yields to a record low, as investors speculated a stalled
economic recovery will spur the Federal Reserve to increase
purchases of government debt.  Notes rallied for a third week as a report showed yesterday
that U.S. manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in September
and New York Fed President  William Dudley  said before next
week’s payrolls report that the central bank will probably need
to take action to spur growth and avert deflation.  “Yields are where they are on the expectation that the Fed
will create a new asset-purchase program,” said  Ira Jersey , an
interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG,
one of the 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed.
“We think that additional QE is probably a foregone conclusion.
If the payroll numbers are much better than expected, then
clearly one would have to re-evaluate likely Fed actions.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield dropped 9 basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 2.51 percent this week, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625 percent security
maturing in August 2020 increased 26/32, or $8.13 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 31/32.  The two-year note  yield  fell 3 basis points to 0.41 percent
after touching the record low of 0.4066 percent yesterday. The
30-year bond yield slid 8 basis points to 3.72 percent.  The Treasury auctioned $100 billion in two-, five-, and
seven-year notes this week at record low yields. The $36 billion
sale of two-year notes on Sept. 27 produced a bid-to-cover ratio
of 3.78, reflecting the highest level of demand since August
2007. The government will announce on Oct. 7 the amounts of 3-,
10- and 30-year debt it’s selling this month.  Flatter Yield Curve  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year securities
over 2-year debt narrowed 0.08 percentage point this week to
2.09 percentage points as investors speculated the Fed will step
up quantitative easing. The spread touched a four-week low of
2.03 percentage points on Sept. 28.  Dudley said in a New York speech yesterday that the central
bank has the “tools that can provide additional stimulus at
costs that do not appear to be prohibitive.”  He said that $500 billion of asset purchases, for example,
would add as much stimulus as reducing the Fed’s benchmark rate
0.50 percentage point to 0.75 percentage point, depending on how
long investors expect the Fed to hold the assets. The Federal
Open Market Committee next meets Nov. 2-3.  The central bank completed a program to buy $1.25 trillion
of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of
agency debt in March. The Fed was the biggest buyer of
Treasuries when it purchased $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  Fed ‘Whims’  “The market has tethered itself to the whims of the Fed,”
 James Caron , head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at the primary
dealer Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote in a research note to
clients yesterday.  While other central bank officials voiced a range of views
in speeches this week, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on
Sept. 30 at a Washington forum with teachers that the central
bank has a duty to aid the U.S. economy as the jobless rate
holds near 10 percent.  The Fed said in its statement following its Sept. 21
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation,
over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  Debt Buying  The central bank retained last week its position from its
Aug. 10 meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at
about $2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the
financial system. The central bank has purchased $36.812 billion
since Aug. 17.  “The Fed has communicated its intent to reflate our way
out of the current environment,” said  Richard Bryant , senior
vice president for fixed income in New York at MF Global
Holdings Ltd., a broker of exchange-traded futures. “That has
allowed yields to remain at these historically low levels.”  The two-year note yield touched a record low yesterday
after the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management
reported that its factory index dropped in September to 54.4,
the lowest level since November 2009, from 56.3 in August.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17.  Private payrolls climbed by 77,000 in September after an
increase of 67,000 in the previous month, according to the
median forecast of 38 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
unemployment rate is expected to increase to 9.7 percent from
9.6 percent. The report from the Labor Department is due for
release on Oct. 8.  “The data is telling us the economy is growing, but
growing very weakly,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury
trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. “It’s becoming
clearer every day that QE II is going to be done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
