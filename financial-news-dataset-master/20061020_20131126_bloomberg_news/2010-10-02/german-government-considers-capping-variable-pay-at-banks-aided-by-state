The German government is examining
whether it can legally cap the variable pay of employees at
banks that received state aid, said  Michael Offer , a spokesman
for the Finance Ministry, in an e-mailed statement.  Offer denied that the government wants to impose a salary
cap of 500,000 euros ($689,550) at such banks, as was reported
by Sueddeutsche Zeitung today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Ragnhild Kjetland  in
