Russia, the world’s largest energy
supplier, pumped a post-Soviet record amount of crude last month
as state-run producer OAO Rosneft increased output at a new
field in Siberia.  Output advanced 1 percent from the same month last year to
10.16 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on Energy Ministry data released today. That beat the
previous record of 10.15 million barrels a day in June.  Rosneft led the advance as it boosted output at its Vankor
field 78 percent to 264,000 barrels a day. That pushed Rosneft’s
total output to 2.27 million barrels a day, excluding its share
of the Tomskneft venture with OAO Gazprom Neft. Smaller rival
OAO Lukoil’s output fell 2.7 percent to 1.79 million barrels.  Russian natural-gas production climbed 14 percent to 1.6
billion cubic meters a day, according to preliminary data.
State-run  OAO Gazprom  increased output in September an annual 2
percent to 36.9 billion cubic meters. OAO Novatek’s output rose
10 percent to 2.9 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
