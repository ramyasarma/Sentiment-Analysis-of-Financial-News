Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa 
declared victory over opposition forces he claims tried to kill
him, and the nation’s sovereign bond spread dropped the most in
15 months after a failed uprising by police and armed forces.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Ecuador’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell below pre-protest levels after
the Sept. 30 action against the president, narrowing 2.16
percentage points to 10.1 percentage points at yesterday’s close
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ index.  Ecuador remains under a state of emergency after police
demonstrating against wage cuts took the president hostage to
demand changes to a new public service law. A subsequent
gunfight between the police and security forces loyal to Correa,
as well as related violence across the country, left eight
people dead and 274 injured, according to the Health Ministry.  “This was a great victory for the government,” Correa
said today in a national address from the presidential palace.
“Nothing justifies the extremes of violence we saw. We will
never let something like this happen again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
