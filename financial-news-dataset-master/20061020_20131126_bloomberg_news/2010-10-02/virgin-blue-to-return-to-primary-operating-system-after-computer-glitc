Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd.,
Australia’s second-biggest airline, said it will return to its
primary operating system on Oct. 6 after a computer problem
disrupted travel plans.  “The initial problem with our primary operating system has
been identified and solved,” CEO and Managing Director John
Borghetti said in an e-mailed statement today. “We are now
making plans to revert to this system. We have a thorough action
plan for the system transition which will mean that any
disruption for our guests will be kept to a minimum during the
changeover period.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
