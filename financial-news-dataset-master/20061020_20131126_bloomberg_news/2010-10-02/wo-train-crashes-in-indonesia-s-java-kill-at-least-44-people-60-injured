Two train crashes in Indonesia’s Java
island killed at least 44 people and injured 60 others,
officials said. The death toll probably will rise as rescuers
remove passengers still trapped in the wreckage.  An Argo Bromo executive class train traveling to Surabaya
from Jakarta slammed into the back of a Senja Utama business
class train that was sitting idle on the same track in the
Petarukan station in Pemalang, central Java, at 2:48 a.m. local
time today, Sugeng Priyono, vice president of public relations
at PT Kereta Api Persero, the national railway operator, said in
a phone interview.  At least 43 people were killed and more than 60 others
injured in the collision, and passengers are still trapped
inside the cars, Priyono said.  The company is investigating whether the collision was
caused by human error or faulty signal equipment, Priyono said.
The two trains should have been on different tracks, he said.  At least one person was killed and three others injured in
a separate train collision in Solo, Java, occurred about 4 a.m.
Jakarta time today, Tunjung Inderawan, director general for
trains at Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation, said by phone.
That crash is under investigation, Inderwan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
