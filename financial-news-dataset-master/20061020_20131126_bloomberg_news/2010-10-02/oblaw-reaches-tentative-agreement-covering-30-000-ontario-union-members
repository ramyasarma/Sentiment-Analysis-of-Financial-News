Loblaw Cos. , Canada’s largest
grocery-store chain, has reached a tentative settlement with
local labor unions, avoiding a strike next week, the company and
the UFCW Canada union said today.  The agreement covers 30,000 union members at Loblaws,
Zehrs, Real Canadian Superstores, Great Food and Fortinos stores
in Ontario. Both sides said they wouldn’t release details of the
settlement until voting is concluded on Oct. 6.
Members of UFCW Canada Locals 1977, 1000A, 175 and 633 are
to begin voting on the pact tomorrow, the parties said in a
statement.  Loblaw and UFCW Canada began negotiating in April. Union
members voted to authorize a strike in June, and the union set
an Oct. 8 strike deadline last month.  The previous contract between the parties expired July 1,
according to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, a
federal agency.  Loblaw employs 138,000 workers at more than 1,000 stores
across Canada, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
