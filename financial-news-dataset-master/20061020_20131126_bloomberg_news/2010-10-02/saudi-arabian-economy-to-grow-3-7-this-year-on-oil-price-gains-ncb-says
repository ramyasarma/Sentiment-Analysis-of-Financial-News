Saudi Arabia’s economy will expand by
3.7 percent this year and 4 percent in 2011 as the world’s
largest oil supplier benefits from high crude oil prices and
government spending, National Commercial Bank said today.  “Higher oil prices are expanding the dominant source of
government revenues,” the  Jeddah-based bank , the largest Saudi
lender by assets, said in an e-mailed report today. “Foreign
capital inflows and resumption of private-sector credit continue
to support the non-oil sector.”  Saudi Arabia has spurred economic growth with a $400
billion, five-year investment package announced in late 2008.
Growth slowed to 0.6 percent in 2009 as the kingdom’s average
daily oil output fell 11 percent to 8.2 million barrels a day,
according to the central bank’s annual report.  Oil for November delivery climbed $1.61, or 2 percent, to
settle yesterday at $81.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It touched $81.64, the highest level since Aug. 5. The
weekly gain of 6.7 percent is the largest since Feb. 19.  The Arab world’s biggest economy produced 8.25 million
barrels of oil in September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Based on an average Arab light crude oil price of $75 a
barrel, the kingdom’s fiscal surplus will be 85 billion riyals
($22.7 billion) in 2010, according to the National Commercial
Bank report. Oil revenue this year will rise 38 percent to 619
billion riyals, compared with 2009.  Inflation will average 5.2 percent this year, compared with
5.1 percent last year, the bank said. Saudi Arabian inflation
accelerated for a seventh month to reach 6.1 percent in August
as the costs of food and rent rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
