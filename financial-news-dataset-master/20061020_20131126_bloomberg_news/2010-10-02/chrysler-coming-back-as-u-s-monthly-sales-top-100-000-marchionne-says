Chrysler Group LLC Chief Executive
Officer Sergio Marchionne said “we’re coming back” after the
carmarker reported U.S. sales of more than 100,000 cars for a
second month in September.  “We’ve been working on the number for quite a while,” he
said today in an interview at a conference in Florence, Italy.
“I’m delighted.”  Chrysler’s U.S. sales last month increased 61 percent to
100,077, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in a
statement yesterday. That topped the 48 percent average estimate
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Deliveries of its
namesake brand rose 92 percent to 17,348, helped by the Town &
Country minivan and Sebring sedan.  “It’s an indication of the turnaround in the United
States, and I think with the product lineup that we’ve got,
we’ll do much better going forward,” Marchionne said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
