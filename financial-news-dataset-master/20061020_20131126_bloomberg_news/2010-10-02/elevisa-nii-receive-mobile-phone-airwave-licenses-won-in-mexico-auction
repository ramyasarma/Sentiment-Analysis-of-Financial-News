NII Holdings Inc. and  Grupo Televisa
SA  received the licenses for mobile-phone airwaves they won in a
Mexican government auction, NII spokeswoman  Claudia Restrepo  said
today in an e-mail.  The handover was delayed by a legal battle in which  Grupo
Iusacell SA , Mexico’s third-biggest wireless carrier, sought to
block the process in court, arguing that NII and Televisa were
paying too little for the airwaves.  Televisa and NII, which operates the Nextel brand in Latin
America, agreed to pay 180.3 million pesos ($14.2 million) for
30 megahertz of nationwide spectrum in the 1.7-gigahertz band
during an auction that ended in July.  The airwaves give the companies capacity to offer third-
generation services such as video downloads to attract customers
from America Movil SAB, Mexico’s largest wireless provider which
is controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim .  Gustavo Cantu , NII Mexico vice president, told Bloomberg
News on Sept. 29 that the two companies would promptly prevail
in the legal dispute and be awarded the airwaves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
