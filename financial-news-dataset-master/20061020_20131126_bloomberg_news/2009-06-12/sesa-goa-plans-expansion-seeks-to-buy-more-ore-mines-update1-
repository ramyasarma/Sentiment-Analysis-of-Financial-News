             Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) ,  India ’s biggest  iron-ore  exporter, said it plans to expand existing operations and
acquire additional mines to more than triple production capacity.  
 Sesa Goa, a unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , aims to reach a
capacity of 50 million metric tons a year from 15 million tons,
Managing Director P.K. Mukherjee said today in a telephone
interview, without giving a timeframe. The company, which
announced a 17.5 billion rupee ($368 million) purchase of  Dempo
Group’s  mining assets yesterday, has more than 41 billion rupees
of cash in hand to finance further acquisitions, he said.  
 Dempo will provide Sesa Goa an estimated 70 million tons of
iron ore reserves and resources in Goa. Sesa Goa is seeking to
increase output by 25 percent this year to tap demand in markets
such as China, the largest user of the steelmaking ingredient.  
 “We are on course to achieve our target,” Mukherjee said.  
 Sesa Goa rose as much as 17.6 percent to 225.75 rupees, the
highest since Jan. 9, 1991. The shares, which have more than
doubled this year, traded at 210.3 rupees, up 8.8 percent, as of
12:28 p.m. in Mumbai. The acquisition was announced after the
market closed yesterday.  
 Sesa Goa will spend as much as $700 million to increase
mining capacity to 25 million tons by next year,  Anil Agarwal ,
chairman of India’s largest copper producer Vedanta Resources,
said in September. Sesa Goa sells almost 90 percent of its
annual 15 million ton output to steelmakers in China and  Japan .  
 Annual contract prices for iron ore, down for the first
time in seven years, may gain 10 percent next year on rising
imports by China, according to Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty analysts.  
 The price for benchmark Australian iron ore fines may rise
to $66 a metric ton in the year starting April 1 from $60 a ton
this year, analysts Malcolm Southwood and Paul Gray wrote in a
June 11 report. They had previously forecast unchanged prices.  
 Prices in the immediate delivery market have risen as much
as $6 a ton to $75 a ton on  China  demand, Mukherjee said.
