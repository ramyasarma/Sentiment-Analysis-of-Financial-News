             LionOre Mining International Ltd. (LIM)  said
a C$6.8 billion ($6.27 billion) takeover offer from  OAO GMK
Norilsk Nickel (GMKN)  was superior to a bid last week from  Xstrata (XTA)  Plc.  
 LionOre's board of directors determined that Norilsk's bid
yesterday of C$27.50 a share in cash was ``a superior proposal,''
the Toronto-based company said today in a statement. Xstrata,
which raised its bid to C$25 a share on May 15, is entitled by
prior agreement to match or top the Norilsk offer by June 1,
LionOre said.  
 Xstrata began the contest for LionOre in March, when it
offered C$18.50 a share in an agreement that gave the Zug,
Switzerland-based company the right to respond to competing
offers.  
 Ian Hamilton, a Toronto-based Xstrata spokesman, declined to
comment on the statement. LionOre spokesman Alex Buck wasn't
immediately available to comment.  
 LionOre's statement today was released after the close of
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where its  shares  fell 7
cents, or 0.3 percent, to C$28.30. They have risen 62 percent
since the session before Xstrata's first bid was announced.
