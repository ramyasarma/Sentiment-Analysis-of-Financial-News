             Russian stocks climbed for the first
time in four days, led by OAO Severstal after Citigroup Inc.
boosted its price estimate for the shares. OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel and OAO Rosneft also advanced.  
 The ruble-denominated Micex Index added 1.9 percent to
1734.42, its biggest gain in three weeks, as all but four of the
30 stocks rose. The index advanced 4.1 percent in July. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  climbed 1.7 percent to 1993.96.  
 ``Last week's damage to sentiment will take a while to
heal, but the near-term outlook now seems somewhat more
encouraging,''  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at  Alfa Bank  in
Moscow, wrote in a research report today.  
 Shares of OAO Severstal,  Russia 's biggest steel company,
climbed 6 percent to 447.06. Citigroup raised its price estimate
on the shares 25 percent to $21 (536 rubles), saying the company
would benefit from new production at a planned mini-mill.  
 ``Severstal has announced a new mini-mill project in
Russia, which is a sign of confidence in the domestic demand and
pricing story,'' Citigroup analyst Mikhail Seleznev in Moscow
wrote in a report to investors.  
 The steelmaker is also likely to complete the consolidation
of the SeverCorr mini-mill in  Mississippi  under ``investor-friendly terms,'' according to Seleznev. Severstal stock lost
8.2 percent in the previous three days after a downgrade from
UralSib Financial Corp.  
 OAO Severstal-Avto, a Russian maker of cars and trucks,
added 8 percent to 961.87 rubles. Deutsche Bank AG raised its
share-price estimate 24 percent to $51.50, saying the joint
venture announced yesterday with Isuzu Motors Ltd. may turn out
to be Severstal-Avto's most profitable vehicle assembly project.  
 Nickel Rebounds  
 Norilsk Nickel , Russia's biggest mining company, climbed
1.2 percent to 5,699.01 rubles. Nickel for three-month delivery
rebounded from a six-month low, adding 3.3 percent to $31,200 a
metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange.  
 Norilsk also raised its estimated 2007 nickel production to
between 295,000 and 300,000 tons, from 270,000 to 275,000 tons,
the company said today in a statement.  
 Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, climbed 2.2 percent
to $8.38 in London. Crude oil rose to a one-year high in  New
York  on speculation demand will outpace supply as refiners
increase fuel production in preparation for the winter months.  
 Separately, Rosneft has invited Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP
Plc and Total SA to participate in a tender for about 7 million
tons of crude oil to be shipped at ports in the  Black Sea  and
the Baltic, Reuters reported, citing unidentified traders.  
 Mechel, Chelyabenergo  
 OAO Mechel, a Russian steelmaker, climbed 5.7 percent to
$43.15 in New York. Moscow-based Troika Dialog raised its price
estimate on the shares 22 percent to $54.40, saying the
``correction'' in Russian stocks provides investors with a
buying opportunity. Mechel's American depositary receipts
dropped 8.8 percent last week, compared with a 4.9 percent
decline in the  Micex Index. (INDEXCF)   
 Shares of OAO Chelyabenergo, the electricity generation
company serving the southern Urals region of Chelyabinsk,
rallied 8.2 percent to 2.239 rubles, its biggest gain this year.
The utility's net income in the first half of 2007 climbed to
435 million rubles ($17 million), compared with a loss of 152
million rubles in the year-earlier period, Interfax reported
yesterday.
