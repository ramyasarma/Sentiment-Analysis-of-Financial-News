Italian stock-market regulator
Consob has been monitoring trading in  UniCredit SpA  shares for
several days, Corriere della Sera reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Consob is also having “difficulty” ascertaining the
position of UniCredit’s Libyan investors because Libya “doesn’t
have a supervisory authority,” the newspaper reported, citing
Consob official Vittorio Conti.  Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo  stepped down on
Sept. 21 after relations soured with some of the bank’s largest
shareholders over Libyan investments in the company.  UniCredit may also introduce a general manager position
following requests from its banking foundation investors,
Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
