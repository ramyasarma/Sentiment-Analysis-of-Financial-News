The euro’s gains against the dollar
are unsustainable amid concern that nations on the currency
region’s periphery will default on their debts, according to
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  “The euro’s recent rally has pushed it back into
overvalued territory against the backdrop of still deteriorating
fundamentals,”  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of
Tokyo in London, wrote in an investor note. “This is
remarkable, and signals to us that it will ultimately prove
unsustainable. The euro is metaphorically speaking facing ‘death
by a thousand cuts.’”  The euro’s rebound from its low of 1.1923 on June 7 has
been driven by its role as the “anti-dollar”, Hardman said, as
investors speculated a sluggish recovery will prompt the Federal
Reserve to increase monetary stimulus for the U.S. economy.  The European currency climbed 0.8 percent to 1.3418 per
dollar at 11:47 a.m. in London. It headed for a second week of
gains, rising 2.6 percent this week.  The currency’s “anti-dollar status is no longer
compelling” as Irish and Portuguese bond yields continue to
widen against those of German bunds, increasing the chance the
nations may be forced to seek external funding from the European
Union or International Monetary Fund, Hardman wrote.  “The euro’s recent renaissance is running on borrowed
time, with euro-dollar in the mid to high 1.30’s likely to prove
very attractive medium-term sell levels,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
