Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  said its
$1.45 billion offer for  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc.  is
its “best and final” bid in its takeover fight with  Avis
Budget Group Inc.   “Our agreement with Dollar Thrifty provides its
shareholders with a substantial premium, deal certainty and a
clear path to deal closure by year end,” Hertz Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Frissora  said today in a statement. “We have made
our best and final offer.”  Avis yesterday increased the cash portion of its offer,
boosting the value to about $1.52 billion, or $53.08 a share.
Hertz’s most recent bid is worth $50.70 a share.  Dollar Thrifty agreed to Hertz’s offer and its  shareholders 
are set to vote on the proposal Sept. 30. The Tulsa, Oklahoma-
based owner of the Dollar and Thrifty car-rental brands has said
it wanted Avis to match Hertz’s $44.6 million breakup fee in
case the acquisition doesn’t win regulatory approval.  Hertz, based in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rose 71 cents, or
6.8 percent, to $11.16 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . Parsippany, New Jersey-based Avis rose 56
cents, or 5.3 percent, to $11.14. Dollar Thrifty fell $1.31, or
2.5 percent, to $51.03.  To contact the reporter on this story:
