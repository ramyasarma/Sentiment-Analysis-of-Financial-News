The University of Pennsylvania, the
Ivy League school founded by  Benjamin Franklin , said the fund
that manages most of its endowment gained 13 percent in the past
year, helped by investments in credit and public equities.  The Associated Investments Fund outperformed its benchmark
by 3.6 percentage points in the year ended June 30, the
university, in Philadelphia, said today in an e-mail.  The $5.7 billion endowment benefited from “strong double-
digit returns in credit” within the absolute-return portfolio,
 Kristin Gilbertson , Penn’s chief investment officer, wrote in an
e-mail. Penn is one of the eight private schools in the
northeastern U.S. that make up the Ivy League.  The Ivy League’s Harvard University, the world’s richest
school, said its $27.4 billion fund gained 11 percent last year,
while Columbia University’s $6.5 billion endowment gained 17
percent.  Institutional funds, including public and corporate
pensions, endowments and foundations, returned a median of 13
percent in the past year, according to Wilshire Associates Inc.,
a consulting firm in Santa Monica, California. The firm’s Trust
Universe Comparison Service tracks 1,300 funds and $3 trillion
in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
