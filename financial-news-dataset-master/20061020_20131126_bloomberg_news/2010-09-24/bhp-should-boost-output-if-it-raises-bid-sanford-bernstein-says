BHP Billiton Ltd., bidding $40
billion for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , would need to
plan higher production rates of the crop nutrient to justify
raising its $130-a-share offer, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said.  “We believe this volume expansion will be the key to
achieving acceptable returns on the acquisition, rather than
simply relying on higher prices,”  Paul Galloway , a London-based
analyst at Bernstein, said in a report. “With BHP likely to
have to pay higher than $150 a share, we believe BHP must be
assuming running Potash Corp. at full capacity and continuing to
allocate additional capital” for expansions, he wrote.  Potash Corp., the world’s biggest  producer  of the mineral,
has said it’s in talks with third parties after rejecting BHP’s
offer last month. Melbourne-based  BHP  will likely raise its bid
by 20 percent to $156 a share, Bernstein said.  “BHP will sit and wait for news of an alternate bidder and
look to stare down Potash Corp.’s shareholders,” Galloway said.
The company said yesterday it had approval from antitrust
regulators in the U.S. The bid still faces regulatory reviews in
Canada.  To contact the reporters on this story:
