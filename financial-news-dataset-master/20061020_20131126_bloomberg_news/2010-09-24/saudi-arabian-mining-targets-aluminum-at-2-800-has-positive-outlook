Saudi Arabian Mining Co. , the
state-controlled metals producer known as Ma’aden, is targeting
a 22 percent jump in the price of aluminum as demand recovers.  An “excellent” price would be $2,800 a metric ton, as
seen before the economic crisis, Executive Director for Project
Management and Engineering  Abdullah Abdulgader  said in an
interview in London. While such an increase “will take time,”
Ma’aden is seeing “very positive indications,” he said.  Aluminum slumped 11 percent in the first half on concern
supply would outpace demand. The metal, used in transport,
packaging and construction, has since rallied on speculation
that unprofitable smelters will shut and carmakers predicted
record production this year. Aluminum for three months ahead
closed at $2,292 on the London Metal Exchange yesterday.  Ma’aden, which operates in the gold, phosphate and other
mining industries, is concentrating on its aluminum business,
Abdulgader said yesterday. The Riyadh-based company is building
an aluminum smelter with  Alcoa Inc.  as part of a 40.5 billion-
riyal ($10.8 billion) industrial complex in Saudi Arabia.  Ma’aden’s board in June approved $4.5 billion in financing
for the first phase of the smelter project, scheduled to start
output in early 2013. The company will borrow from local and
foreign banks and government funds, it said.  Ma’aden plans to be the lowest-cost producer of the metal,
which will “give us an edge to have a good place in the
market,” Abdulgader said.  The company reported a second-quarter  profit  of 31.2
million riyals in July, after posting a loss of 6.56 million
riyals a year earlier. Ma’aden sold 50 percent of its shares in
an initial public offering in 2008.  United Co. Rusal , the world’s biggest aluminum producer,
said Sept. 21 it expects prices for the metal to reach $2,400 to
$2,500 a ton next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
