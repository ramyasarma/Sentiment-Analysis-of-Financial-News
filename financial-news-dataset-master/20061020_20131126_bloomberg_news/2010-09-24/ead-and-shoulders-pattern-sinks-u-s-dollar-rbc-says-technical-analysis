The dollar may weaken further
against the currencies of six major trading partners as a gauge
of greenback strength formed a so-called  head-and-shoulders 
trading pattern, according to Royal Bank of Canada.  InterContinentalExchange Inc’s Dollar Index’s  break  below
the 200-day moving average of 81.91 contributed to the pattern.
A head-and-shoulders model occurs when a price forms three
consecutive peaks or valleys, the middle being the biggest.  “The resolution of a head and shoulders pattern for the
Dollar Index paints a very ominous bearish profile for the U.S.
dollar over the next 10 to 12 months,”  George Davis , chief
technical analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  “Based on the setup that is forming in the Dollar Index,
78.41 would serve as an initial downside target,” Davis said in
an e-mail. “Then 76.60 and 74.17 serving as longer-term
targets.”  The Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against
the currencies of Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Britian, Japan
and the euro, fell 0.7 percent touching 79.33, the weakest level
since Feb. 3. The dollar fell against 15 of 16 of the most-
traded currencies today.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
