Zimbabwean Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  raised his economic growth forecast for this year to 8.4
percent from 4.5 percent,  Zimonline  reported, without saying how
it got the information.  Growth will be driven by better-than-expected agricultural
production, the Johannesburg-based news agency said on its
website. The southern African nation produced about 120 million
kilograms (250 million pounds) of tobacco this year, 71 percent
more than the expected, Zimonline said.  Calls to Biti’s office weren’t immediately answered when
Bloomberg sought comment this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
