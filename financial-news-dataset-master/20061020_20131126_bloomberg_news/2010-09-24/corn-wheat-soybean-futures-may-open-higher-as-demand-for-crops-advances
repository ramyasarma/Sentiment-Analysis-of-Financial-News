What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as the dollar’s slide and
signs of U.S. economic growth spur demand for crop-based animal
feed and fuel, said  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst for North
American Risk Management Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on concerns that dry weather will damage crops in
Russia, Australia and Argentina, boosting demand for U.S.
exports, Gidel said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that a slumping dollar will boost
global demand for animal feed and vegetable oil made from U.S.
supplies, Gidel said. Soybean-meal futures may be steady to $1
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open 0.3
cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
