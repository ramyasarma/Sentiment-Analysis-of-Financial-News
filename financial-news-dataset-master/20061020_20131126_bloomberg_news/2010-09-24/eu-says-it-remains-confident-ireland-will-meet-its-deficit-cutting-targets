The European Union said the
contraction in Ireland’s economy in the second quarter shouldn’t
derail the government’s efforts to cut its budget deficit.  “We remain confident that the Irish authorities will take
the necessary measures in order to meet their fiscal
consolidation targets,” Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for EU
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, told
reporters in Brussels today. “That will be reflected in the
budget for next year.”  Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said today that it’s
“too early” to signal a tougher budget for 2011 after data
yesterday showed the economy shrank 1.2 percent in the April-
June quarter from the previous three-month period. Lenihan has
pledged to cut the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic
product by 2013 from 14 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
