Crude oil rose the most in two
weeks as the dollar dropped against the euro, bolstering the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  Oil climbed 1.7 percent after the greenback slipped against
the common currency on a report showing that German business
confidence unexpectedly increased to a three-year high in
September. Futures extended gains after a U.S. report showed
orders for capital equipment rebounded in August.  “Dollar weakness is propelling all of the commodity
markets,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “Commodities
aren’t being purchased for end usage, but as a store of value.”  Crude for November delivery rose $1.31 to $76.49 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement
since Sept. 13. It was the biggest gain since Sept. 10, when the
shutdown of an Enbridge Energy Partners LP pipeline curbed
deliveries of Canadian oil to U.S. Midwest refineries. The
November contract rose 2.1 percent this week.  Brent crude oil for November settlement gained 76 cents, or
1 percent, to end the session at $78.87 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar declined to $1.3485 per euro, down 1.3 percent
from $1.3314 yesterday. The U.S. currency touched $1.3493
against the euro, the lowest level since April.  “Gold, silver and platinum are all surging and the grains
and livestock have been strong,” O’Grady said. “Energy has
been the laggard in the commodity index. At some point before
long we’re going to see it catch up with the metals and
agricultural products.”  Commodity Rally  The greenback’s fall helped send gold to a record and
silver to a 30-year high. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
commodities advanced 1.2 percent to 283.63, the highest level in
eight months.  “Oil is finally following gold and the other commodities,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
Chicago. “Oil was held back earlier this week by the bearish
fundamentals. Demand is weak, inventories are at the highest
level since they began keeping track and the economic news
wasn’t great.”  U.S. consumption  of petroleum products fell 1.8 percent to
19.2 million barrels a day last week, the Energy Department
reported on Sept. 22.  Total petroleum supplies , including crude
oil and fuel, rose 3.3 million barrels to 1.14 billion last
week, the highest level since at least 1990.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its  business climate
index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest level since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  U.S. Capital Goods  Bookings for U.S. goods like computers and communications
gear rose 4.1 percent after a 5.3 percent decline in July that
was smaller than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington. Total orders fell 1.3
percent, depressed by volatile demand for aircraft. Orders
excluding transportation equipment rose more than forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.1 percent to
1,148.67 at 4:15 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed
1.9 percent to 10,860.26.  “Equities are up and the dollar is under pressure, a
combination that usually sends oil higher,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “Oil also rises whenever there are
headlines that point to an improving economy.”  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. boosted its Brent price forecast for
the fourth quarter of this year to $83 a barrel. The European
benchmark, which is used to price two-thirds of global oil, will
average $90 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2011, the company
predicted in a research note today.  Price Forecast  Crude may fall next week on speculation that U.S. supplies
will climb as fuel demand falls, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast crude oil will
decline through Oct. 1. Nine respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted little change, and four estimated prices will rise.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 575,790 contracts as of 3:20
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 616,993
contracts yesterday, 3.3 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.32 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
