The euro advanced against the
dollar after a report showed German business confidence
unexpectedly rose to a three-year high in September.  Europe’s common currency advanced by 0.4 percent to $1.3366
at 9:11 a.m. in London. It also extended its gain versus the
yen, appreciating by 0.6 percent to 113.07.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
