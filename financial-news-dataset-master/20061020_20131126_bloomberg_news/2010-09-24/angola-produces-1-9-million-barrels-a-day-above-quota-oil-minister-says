Angola, which vies with Nigeria as
Africa’s top oil producer, is pumping 1.9 million barrels a day
and is exceeding its OPEC quota, the country’s oil minister
said.  “Angola, with a production of 1.9 million barrels of oil
per day, is the second largest producer in the Gulf of Guinea
region,” oil minister  Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos  said
yesterday at an energy conference in Washington.  Angola says its production quota within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is 1.65 million barrels a day.
OPEC documents obtained by Bloomberg when the quotas were set in
late 2008 put the target at 1.517 million barrels a day. OPEC no
longer publishes individual national quotas on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
