U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after orders for durable goods excluding transportation
equipment rose at twice the pace forecast by economists, easing
concern the economic recovery is slowing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December increased 0.8 percent to 1,129.2 at 8:31 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 82 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 10,688.  Durable goods orders excluding transportation climbed 2
percent in August, the Commerce Department said. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had predicted an increase of 1 percent,
according to the survey median.  The S&P 500 has climbed 7.2 percent in September as
technology bellwethers announced buybacks, dividends and
acquisitions. The benchmark for U.S. equities has declined 7.6
percent from this year’s high in April on concern that American
unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe would derail
global growth.  Commerce Department figures at 10 a.m. Washington time may
show sales of new houses rose last month from a record low in
July.  Earlier gains in futures came after Nike Inc., the largest
athletic-shoe maker, reported higher-than-estimated earnings.  Total orders for athletic shoes and clothes for delivery
between September and January grew 10 percent to $7.1 billion,
the company said in its earnings statement yesterday. Orders for
China surged 25 percent, outpacing all other regions on demand
for basketball-related sportswear, compared with 15 percent in
North America and declines of 7 percent in Western Europe and 8
percent in Japan.  European equities recovered from earlier losses after
German business confidence unexpectedly rose to a three-year
high in September, suggesting companies can weather weaker
demand from abroad as the global economic recovery slows.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
