Japan’s economy may be hurt by
its political dispute with China, Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda  said today, signaling widening concern at the
consequences of tensions with the nation’s biggest trading
partner.  “Given that our growth strategy has been to incorporate
Asian demand into our own demand, the current rare-earth,
rare-metal problem that has been reported in the press is
becoming a very big obstacle,” Kaieda told reporters in
Tokyo today. “I hope for the earliest possible resolution to
this problem.”  Kaieda spoke after a spat erupted this month over
Japan’s detention of a fishing-boat captain. The Chinese
sailor was detained after his vessel collided with two
Japanese Coast Guard vessels.  Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  said separately
that there’s no confirmation of a Chinese embargo on so-
called rare-earth elements. The New York Times reported
yesterday that it put an embargo on exports of the products,
which are used in items including cars and weapons, to Japan.
Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman  Chen Rongkai  said
yesterday that “China does not have a trade embargo on rare
earth exports to Japan.”  A deterioration in the relationship between China and
Japan would be negative for the global economy as a whole,
Japan’s finance minister,  Yoshihiko Noda , told reporters in
Tokyo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
