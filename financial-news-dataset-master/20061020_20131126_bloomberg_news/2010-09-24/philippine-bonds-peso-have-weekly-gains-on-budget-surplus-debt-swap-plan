Philippine bonds and the peso were
headed for weekly gains after the government reported a budget
surplus for August and said it is considering a debt swap that
would alleviate the need to raise funds for maturing notes.  The Philippines may follow up an ongoing $3 billion dollar
bond exchange with a peso debt swap this year, Finance Secretary
 Cesar Purisima  said this week. August’s 1.3 billion pesos ($29.5
million) surplus resulted in a  deficit  for the last eight months
of 228.1 billion pesos, the government reported Sept. 20 The
Bureau of Internal Revenue is likely to meet its 59.9 billion
peso collection target for September, Commissioner  Kim Henares 
said yesterday.  “There’s been a slew of positive news like the budget
surplus and the possible peso bond exchange and both are
indicating that there would be less pressure for the government
to borrow,” said  Malou Liwag , senior vice president for
treasury marketing at Philippine National Bank in Manila.  The yield on the 7 percent January 2016 peso bond fell 29
basis points this week to 5.25 percent as of 10:40 a.m. in
Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services. That would be
the biggest decline in six weeks.  The government is considering a change in the way it
collects cigarette and alcohol levies that would bring in an
extra 50 billion pesos of revenue a year, Purisima said in New
York this week. The Philippines is optimistic it will keep the
budget deficit within the 325 billion peso target this year, the
finance chief said.  The peso gained 0.3 percent this week to 44.06 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It’s strengthened 5.1 percent
this quarter and reached a two-year high of 43.87 on Sept. 22.  Menu of Options  The Philippine central bank has a “menu” of options to
address peso appreciation, which has its limits, Deputy Governor
Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday.  The yield on the 9.375 percent January 2017 dollar bonds,
one of the notes eligible for the bond exchange ending on Sept.
28, fell 25 basis points this week to 3.033 percent.  The government will accept dollar notes due in 2011 to
2017 for at least $500 million of new 10-year bonds, and
securities maturing in 2019 to 2031 or additional 6.375 percent
October 2034 debt it is issuing, it said Sept. 20.  The administration of President Benigno Aquino is seeking
to fix the nation’s finances by tapping new sources of funds and
extending the average maturity of its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
