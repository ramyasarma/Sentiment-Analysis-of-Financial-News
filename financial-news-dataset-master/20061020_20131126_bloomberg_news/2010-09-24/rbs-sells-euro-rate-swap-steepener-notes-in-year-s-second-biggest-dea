Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  is
selling 100 million euros ($133 million) of notes that pay the
difference between longer- and shorter-dated swap rates in the
second-biggest offering of the debt this year.  The seven-year notes, called constant-maturity swap
steepeners, pay a fixed annual coupon of 5 percent in the first
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Holders then get
payments equal to four times the difference between the 10-year
and two-year swap rates.  Demand from investors betting that long-term borrowing
costs will rise faster than short-term rates has spurred sales
of steepener notes in Europe to $3.6 billion this year from $2.8
billion in 2009, while in the U.S. issuance more than tripled
last month, Bloomberg data show.  Morgan Stanley sold this year’s biggest steepener note on
Sept. 22. The $100 million issue pays 10 percent in the first
year, then five times the two-year, 10-year dollar swap spread.  The difference between two-year and 10-year euro swap rates
was 1.26 percentage points at 3:26 p.m. in London. The gap,
which widened to 1.95 percentage points in May, has averaged
1.51 during the past 12 months, Bloomberg data show.  The 10-year swap rate was last below two-year swaps in
September 2008, according to Bloomberg data. Interest-rate swaps
allow borrowers to exchange fixed interest payments for floating
rates.  RBS’s notes were sold to investors in Italy and have a 1
percent bid-offer spread in secondary market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
