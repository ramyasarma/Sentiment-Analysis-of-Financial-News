Latvia’s austerity measures during
the peak of the financial crisis “saved” its Baltic neighbors,
Lithuanian Prime Minister  Andrius Kubilius  said.  “Last year, we were looking with very deep nervousness”
at how Latvia would cope with the crisis, Kubilius told the
Baltic Economic Forum today in Riga, the Latvian capital. Prime
Minister  Valdis Dombrovskis  “not only saved Latvia, but all our
region,” Kubilius said. “He’s the real unsung hero.”  Latvia applied for an international bailout from the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2008 after
its second-biggest bank collapsed. The country resisted calls
from economists including  Nouriel Roubini  and  Paul Krugman  to
abandon its currency peg. Latvia opted for austerity measures
totaling more than 11 percent of gross domestic product in 2009,
an unprecedented adjustment in a single year, according to an
IMF working paper released earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
