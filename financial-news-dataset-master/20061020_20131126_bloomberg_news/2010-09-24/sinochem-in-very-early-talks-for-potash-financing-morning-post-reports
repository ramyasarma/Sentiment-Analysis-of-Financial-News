Sinochem Corp. is in “very early
stage” discussions with banks about financing for a bid for
 Potash Corp . of Saskatchewan, the South China Morning Post said,
citing unidentified senior bankers based in Hong Kong.  Sinochem is entertaining loan proposals from international
and Chinese banks rather than actively searching for cash, the
Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper reported today.
Sinochem hasn’t yet decided whether to proceed with a bid for
Potash, the Post said.  Li Qiang, a spokesman for Sinochem, declined to comment on
the report today when contacted by phone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
