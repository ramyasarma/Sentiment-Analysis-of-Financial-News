Iraq’s crude oil exports through
Turkey “suddenly” dropped by about 20 percent due to a
technical fault on the Iraqi side of the border, according to an
official for the state-run  North Oil Co.   “The flow suddenly dropped from the usual level of 600,000
barrels a day to between 400,000 and 450,000 barrels a day”
yesterday, Imad Baqer, head of the company’s production
department, said today by telephone from Baghdad.  Iraqi technicians were trying to fix the fault and flows in
the pipeline are due to return to their usual level in a few
days, he said.  Supplies from the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, which carries
about a quarter of Iraq’s total crude exports, halted at the end
of August for four days because a technical fault on both sides
of the border.  The link from the northern Kirkuk fields to the Turkish
port of Ceyhan was halted for four days after a bombing on the
Iraqi side of the pipeline on Aug. 20 and stopped briefly in
early July after sabotage by Kurdish rebels on the Turkish side.  The pipeline runs through a region where al-Qaeda and other
armed groups operate. Iraq, which has the world’s fourth-largest
oil reserves, produces about 2.4 million barrels of crude a day,
according to Bloomberg estimates. Insurgents have targeted the
country’s oil installations since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
