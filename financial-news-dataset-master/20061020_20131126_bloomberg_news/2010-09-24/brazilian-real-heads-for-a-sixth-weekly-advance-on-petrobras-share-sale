Brazil’s real rose for a sixth
week, the longest winning streak in 11 months, as Petroleo
Brasileiro SA’s $70 billion share sale attracted foreign
investment.  The real advanced 0.6 percent to 1.7109 per dollar, from
1.7213 on Sept. 17. The currency rallied for seven consecutive
weeks in the period ended Oct. 16, 2009, prompting the
government to impose taxes on foreigners in stocks and bonds.  Petroleo Brasileiro, the state-controlled oil company known
as Petrobras, raised 120.4 billion reais ($70 billion) from the
Brazilian government and other investors in the world’s largest
share sale. The sale amounted to about 18 percent of the value
of all equity offerings completed in 2010, and exceeded by three
times the record initial public offering of $22.1 billion by
Agricultural Bank of China in July, according to Bloomberg data.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 increased nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 11.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
