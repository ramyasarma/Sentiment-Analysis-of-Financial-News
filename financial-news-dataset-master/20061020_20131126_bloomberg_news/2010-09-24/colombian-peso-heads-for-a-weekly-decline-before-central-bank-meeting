Colombia’s peso had its biggest
weekly drop in more than a month on speculation policy makers
may announce further measures to ease the currency’s world-
beating rally.  The peso fell 0.2 percent this week, the biggest decline
since the period ended Aug. 13. It advanced 0.5 percent today to
1,802.20 per dollar at 5:25 p.m. New York time, from 1,811.57
yesterday. The peso has jumped 13.4 percent this year, the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  told reporters in
Bogota today that they will continue to coordinate with the
Finance Ministry to “strengthen their intervention and
sterilization” capacities. Uribe also said the bank may
complement dollar purchases with other measures if needed. The
announcement came after the market closed.  Banco de la Republica “left the door open for more
intervention,” said  Daniel Velandia , head analyst at Bogota-
based brokerage Correval SA.  The central bank said in a Sept. 15 statement it plans to
buy a minimum of $20 million daily for at least four months to
bolster foreign reserves. It has been buying $20 million on
average daily, Uribe said.  Should the peso strengthen beyond 1,780 policy makers will
likely increase the amount of dollars purchased daily and should
it gain beyond 1,750 “we may see capital controls put into
place,” Velandia said.  Policy makers may order Colombian companies and investors
taking overseas loans to deposit a percentage of the funds in
the central bank should they decide to bring the funds into the
country, according to Velandia.  Banco de la Republica left its  overnight lending rate 
unchanged at a record low of 3 percent, matching the forecast of
all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due 2020 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.25 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.099 centavo to 125.699 centavos per peso today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
