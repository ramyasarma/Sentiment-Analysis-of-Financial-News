Morgan Stanley raised its year-end
forecast for the euro against the pound as the U.K.’s efforts to
reduce its budget deficit may crimp growth, while the European
Central Bank focuses on damping inflation expectations.  “The euro’s fundamentals are improving and the U.K. faces
many challenges as it tries to tighten fiscal policy,”  Stephen Hull , London-based head of global currency strategy, wrote in an
investor note dated yesterday. “The euro will likely be one of
the strongest global currencies for the remainder of 2010.”  Morgan Stanley raised its fourth-quarter forecast for the
euro against the pound to 87 pence from 83 pence, according to
the note.  The pound was little changed at 85 pence as of 8:40 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
