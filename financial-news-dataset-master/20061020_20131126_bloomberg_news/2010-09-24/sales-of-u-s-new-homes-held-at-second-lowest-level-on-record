Fewer U.S. new homes than forecast
were sold in August, signaling the housing market remains
depressed even as mortgage rates dropped.  Purchases  were unchanged at a 288,000 annual pace, matching
July as the second-lowest in data going back to 1963, figures
from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington. The
median price fell to the lowest level in more than six years.  A  jobless rate  hovering around 10 percent will probably keep
foreclosures elevated and dissuade some consumers from taking
additional debt to buy houses. The inability of housing to
rebound one year after the economic recovery began is among
reasons Federal Reserve policy makers this week said they are
willing to take additional steps to spur growth.  “There is no upside momentum in housing, period,” said
Eric Green, chief market economist at TD Securities Inc. in New
York who correctly forecast the level of sales. “Unemployment is
so high, consumer confidence is so low, household wealth is
eroded and the psychology remains negative.”  Another Commerce Department report today showed  orders  for
capital equipment rebounded in August, signaling business
investment is holding up better than some economists projected.  Bookings  for goods like computers and communications gear
climbed 4.1 percent after a 5.3 percent decline in July that was
smaller than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington.  Total orders  dropped 1.3
percent, depressed by volatile demand for aircraft, and bookings
excluding transportation equipment rose more than forecast.  Stocks Rally  Stocks held earlier gains spurred by the durable goods
report. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.7 percent to
1,143.36 at 10:15 a.m. in New York. Treasury securities fell,
sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to 2.59
percent from 2.55 percent late yesterday.  Economists forecast new home sales would increase to a
295,000 annual pace, according to the median of 72 survey
projections. Estimates ranged from 270,000 to 325,000. The
government revised the July figure up from a prior estimate of
276,000. The record-low was reached in May at a 282,000 pace.  The median price decreased 1.2 percent from August 2009 to
$204,700, the lowest since December 2003.  Regional Breakdown  Purchases fell in two of four regions. An 11 percent drop in
the South, the biggest region, brought sales down to a record low
148,000, and demand decreased 26 percent in the Midwest. Sales
surged 54 percent in the West and climbed 17 percent in the
Northeast.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate fell to 8.6
months’ worth from 8.7 months in July. There were 206,000 new
houses on the market at the end of August, the fewest since
August 1968.  Reports earlier this week showed the housing market is
hovering at low rates.  Housing starts  increased to an annual rate
of 598,000 and outpaced the gain in building permits, signaling
construction will probably cool.  Sales of  existing homes  increased to a 4.13 million rate in
August, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. The
pace was still the second-lowest on record going back a decade.  Home resales are tabulated when a contract is closed, while
new-home sales are counted at the time an agreement is signed,
making them a leading indicator of demand.  Tax Credit  A government tax credit of up to $8,000 gave housing a
temporary lift late last year and into 2010. Demand for new
houses plunged in May, the month after buyers were originally
required to sign deals in order to get the incentive.  After averaging 9.3 percent in 2009, joblessness this year
will average 9.6 percent and 9.2 percent in 2011, according to
the median forecast  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg this
month. The last time unemployment exceeded 9 percent for three
consecutive years  was from 1939 to 1941.  The lack of jobs is also one reason foreclosures are
climbing as households stop making mortgage payments. Home
 seizures  reached a record in August for the third time in five
months, RealtyTrac Inc. said Sept. 16.  The Obama administration said Aug. 30 it planned to announce
proposals in the next few weeks for an emergency loan program for
the unemployed to avert default, and a government mortgage
refinancing effort to lower monthly mortgage payments to avoid
foreclosures.  Fed’s View  The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate in the
range of zero to 0.25 percent this week, where it’s been since
December 2008, and said the pace of recovery and job growth have
“slowed in recent months.” The central bank said it will
“continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial
developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation
if needed.”  The end of the homebuyer credit, joblessness and sagging
confidence prompted a decline in orders at  Hovnanian Enterprises 
Inc., the largest homebuilder in New Jersey said on Sept 1. The
company said its net orders dropped 37 percent in the quarter
ended July 31 from a year earlier.  “Job creation is the key to a housing recovery, which makes
it difficult to predict how improvements in the economy and
housing market play out,” Chief Executive Officer  Ara Hovnanian 
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
