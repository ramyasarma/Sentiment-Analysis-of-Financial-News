Talbots Inc. rose  the most  since
March amid speculation that investors who sold the shares short
were covering their bearish bets against the clothing retailer.  Talbots gained as much as 13 percent to $12.32, the highest
intraday level since June, as of 1:53 p.m. in New York.  Short
interest  in Talbots has increased to 17 percent of outstanding
shares as of Sept. 22, from 5.1 percent on April 19, according
to Data Explorers, a New York- and London-based research firm
that tracks short sales. Companies in the Russell 2000 Index
have an 8.3 percent average short interest, Bloomberg data show.  The retailer slumped Sept. 8 after reducing its annual
 revenue forecast . sales for the year will climb in the “low
single digits” in percentage terms, less than the 3 percent to
5 percent increase previously projected, Talbots said then.  “When Talbots reported disappointing results, a lot of
traders came in and shorted,” said  Jamie Lissette , founder of
the  Hammerstone Group , a Westport, Connecticut-based operator of
online discussion forums for investors. “The recent surge in
retail and other stocks have a lot of them finally
capitulating.”  Short sellers profit from the decline in share prices by
selling borrowed stock and later replacing it with cheaper
shares.  The Hingham, Massachusetts-based company has rallied 27
percent since falling to a eight-month low in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
