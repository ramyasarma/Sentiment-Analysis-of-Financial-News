Bank of America Corp . sold 130
million euros ($173 million) of 12-year fixed-to-floating rate
structured notes.  The so-called switch notes pay a fixed coupon of 5.1
percent for the first three years, after which investors get
payments equal to the 10-year euro swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The floating rate has a floor of 4
percent and an 8 percent cap.  Bonds linked to swaps allow investors to bet on the
direction of interest rates. The 10-year rate dropped to 2.27
percent on Aug. 30, the lowest since the euro’s start in 1999.
It was at 2.6 percent at 8:45 a.m. London. The notes were issued
at 100 percent of face value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
