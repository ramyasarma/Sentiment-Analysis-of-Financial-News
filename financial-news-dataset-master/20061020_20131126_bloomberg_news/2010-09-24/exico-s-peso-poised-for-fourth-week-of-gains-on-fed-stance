Mexico’s peso rose for a fourth
week, the longest streak since March, as the Federal Reserve
said it was willing to ease monetary policy further to spur
economic growth, fueling demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso rose 2.1 percent to 12.5397 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.7994 on Sept. 17, for the biggest weekly
gain since the week ended July 9. The peso increased 0.9 percent
today, the biggest gain since Sept. 1.  “The bet is now that a second recession can be avoided,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “Mexico has defended itself well abroad.”  The Fed refrained from expanding its holdings of securities
and instead said it’s prepared to “provide additional
accommodation” to bolster the U.S. economy, the biggest buyer
of Mexican exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.454 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.09 centavo to 132.90 centavos per peso.  Mexico’s central bank held the benchmark interest rate at a
record low 4.5 percent today. All 15 economists in a Bloomberg
survey had said the rate would remain unchanged. The central
bank won’t raise the rate until September 2011, according to a
Sept. 21 survey of economists by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.  Traders triggered $138 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $595
million in options have been exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.
The currency has gained 3.4 percent against the dollar this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
