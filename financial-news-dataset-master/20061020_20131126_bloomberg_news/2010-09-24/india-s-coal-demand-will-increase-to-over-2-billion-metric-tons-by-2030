India’s coal demand may more than
triple in the next two decades as Asia’s second-fastest growing
major economy seeks the fuel to generate electricity and run
steel, cement plants.  The nation may consume more than 2 billion metric tons of
coal by 2030, Coal Minister  Sriprakash Jaiswal  said in New Delhi
today. India produces 530 million tons of the fuel a year and
imports about 67 million tons annually. The South Asian country
has coal reserves of about 277 billion tons, he said.  Coal currently fires 53 percent of installed power
generation capacity in India and the government expects the fuel
to remain the most important source of energy for the country.
India and neighbor China may become the dominant importers of
coal during the next 10 years, displacing Western nations,
according to Deutsche Bank AG.  The nation’s coal output is expected to rise to 1 billion
tons a year in the next eight to nine years, according to
Jaiswal. That’s 30 percent of China’s estimated annual
production this year.  State-owned  Coal India Ltd. , the world’s biggest producer
of the fuel, plans to buy mines in Indonesia, Australia, South
Africa and the U.S., Jaiswal said in a statement today.  Coal India mines most of India’s proven reserves of about
110 billion tons and the country’s deposits are expected to last
for more than 100 years, according to Jaiswal.  India’s coal purchases from overseas are expected to grow
to 200 million tons by March 2016 from 80 million tons planned
in the year ending March 2011,  Partha Bhattacharyya , chairman of
Coal India, said at the conference.  Rising demand in India may drive up international coal
prices, said Bhattacharyya. The government plans to sell a 10
percent stake in Coal India in an initial public offer next
month.  Coal is used to fire 87,858 megawatts of India’s installed
capacity of 164,509 megawatts as of Aug. 31, according to the
 Central Electricity Authority .  To contact the reporters on this story:
