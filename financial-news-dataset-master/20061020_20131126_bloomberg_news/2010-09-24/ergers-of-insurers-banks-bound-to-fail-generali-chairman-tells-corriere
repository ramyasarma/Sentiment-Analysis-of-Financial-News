Mergers of insurers and banks are
bound to fail as they do different jobs and the financial crisis
showed too-big-to-fail institutions are a problem,  Assicurazioni
Generali SpA  Chairman  Cesare Geronzi  told Corriere della Sera.  Geronzi said that attempts to merge banks and insurers in
Europe “failed” and that uniting Generali with  Mediobanca SpA ,
its biggest shareholder, “has never been and will never be on
the cards,” he told Corriere an interview published today.  Geronzi also said that relations between Generali and
Mediobanca will not change following the resignation of former
 UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
