Blackstone Group LP, the U.S.
private-equity firm, is in talks to buy a stake in Brazilian
asset management company Patria Investimentos, O Estado de S.
Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  Blackstone has had a strategic alliance with Patria since
2004 and may announce the purchase as soon as next week, the
newspaper said. Patria and Blackstone have been studying
companies in the oil and gas, mining and agribusiness industries
in Brazil this year, Estado said.   The newspaper said Patria declined to comment on the report.  Officials at Blackstone and Patria didn’t immediately return
calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment before regular working
hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
