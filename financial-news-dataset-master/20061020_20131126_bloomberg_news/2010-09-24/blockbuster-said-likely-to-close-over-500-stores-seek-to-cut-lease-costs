Blockbuster Inc., the video
retailer operating in bankruptcy, is likely to close more than
500 stores and will seek ways to reduce lease costs on hundreds
of others, a person with knowledge of the plans said.  The actual number of stores is still being worked out
following the Dallas-based company’s Chapter 11 filing today,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
deliberations are private and subject to court approval.  Patty Sullivan , a spokeswoman for Blockbuster, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment after
normal business hours. The Wall Street Journal reported the
store closings earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
