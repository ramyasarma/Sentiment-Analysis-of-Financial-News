Austria’s economy will expand more
than previously forecast this year and in 2011 because of higher
exports, a government-sponsored research group said.  Gross domestic product may grow 2 percent in 2010 and 1.9
percent next year, Wifo, which compiles government statistics,
said today in an e-mailed statement from Vienna. On July 2, Wifo
predicted GDP would increase 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
