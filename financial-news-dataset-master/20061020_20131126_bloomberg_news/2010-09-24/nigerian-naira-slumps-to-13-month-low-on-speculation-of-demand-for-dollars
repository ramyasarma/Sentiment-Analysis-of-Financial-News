Nigeria’s naira depreciated to its
lowest level in more than a year versus the dollar on
speculation companies stepped up dollar purchases to repatriate
profits and buy imported goods.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
slumped as much as 0.7 percent to 154.8 to the dollar, the
weakest intraday level since Aug. 25, 2009, and traded 0.1
percent lower at 153.905 by 2:31 p.m. in Lagos from a previous
close of 153.72.  Nigeria’s economy “is import-dependent and at this time of
the year demand for foreign currency is normally high as
companies increase importation to prepare for the end-of-the-
year sales,” Kwekwu Brown, an analyst with Lagos-based Source
Capital Nigeria Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.  The Central Bank of Nigeria failed to meet demand for
dollars by lenders for the sixth consecutive session at its
twice-weekly foreign exchange auction on Sept. 22, selling  $400
million  as lenders demanded  $646.2 million .  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer depends on oil exports
for more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange income, the
source of funding for the central bank foreign-currency
auctions. The country’s oil revenue declined as crude oil prices
plunged from record highs reached in July 2008.  “Nigeria’s currency is potentially unstable since the
inflow of foreign exchange depends on oil exports and the value
of the currency would always fall when oil prices drop,” said
Brown.  The country’s foreign reserves currently stand at $36.6
billion on Sept. 13, compared with a high of $58.3 billion in
March 2008. The central bank increased its benchmark interest
rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Sept. 21 to curb a
pickup in inflation after the annual rate accelerated to 13.7
percent in August from 13 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
