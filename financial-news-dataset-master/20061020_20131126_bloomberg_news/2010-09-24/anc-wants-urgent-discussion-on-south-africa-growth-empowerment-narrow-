South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress wants an “urgent” discussion on a “new
growth path” for the country, said Trevor Manuel, the country’s
former finance minister and member of the party’s economic
transformation committee.  The party wants to focus on job creation and is worried
that black economic empowerment has been too narrow, he said in
the eastern port city of Durban today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
