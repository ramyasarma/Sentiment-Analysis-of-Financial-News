Hong Kong stocks  rose for a fourth
week as Nike Inc.’s better-than-estimated profit boosted
supplier Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., while PCCW Ltd.
gained after the Sing Tao Daily said the company plans to seek a
separate listing for a unit.  Yue Yuen, the world’s largest supplier of branded athletic
shoes, advanced 1.6 percent. PCCW, Hong Kong’s No. 1 phone
company, jumped 3.7 percent. Among stocks that debuted today,
 Magic Holdings International Ltd. , which makes cosmetic facial
masks, soared 37 percent in its trading debut.  HSBC Holdings Plc 
slid 0.6 percent after a person briefed on the matter said the
company’s chief executive officer will step down.  “We’re set for an ongoing rally in the fourth quarter with
company earnings as a major support,” said  Francis Lun , general
manager at Fulbright Securities Ltd. For HSBC, “whoever takes
over doesn’t really matter as long as they focus on China.
People are looking at it as if it’s a soap opera.”  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 0.3 percent to close at
22,119.43, extending its gains in a holiday-shortened week to
0.7 percent, its fourth straight weekly advance. Markets were
shut yesterday for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
rose 0.2 percent to 12,218.60.  Shares fell earlier, dragging the main Hang Seng gauge down
by 0.4 percent, following an unexpected increase in U.S. jobless
claims. The Hang Seng Index has surged 17 percent from its low
this year on May 25 amid optimism the U.S. economy will avoid
falling back into a recession and that China will ease monetary
policy to spur growth.  Nike Supplier  Stocks on the Hang Seng trade at an average 14.2 times
estimated profit, compared with 12.5 times on May 25.  Yue Yuen  rose 1.6 percent to HK$28.80. Nike, the world’s
largest maker of athletic shoes, said first-quarter profit rose
8.9 percent to $559 million, or $1.14 a share. That exceeded the
average estimate of $1 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The
company also reported orders for China surged 25 percent.  PCCW  gained 3.7 percent to HK$2.84. The company plans to
seek a separate listing for its Now TV pay-television unit, Sing
Tao Daily reported, citing people it didn’t identify. PCCW has
“no firm plans yet” for the spinoff, Chairman  Richard Li  said
in a mobile-phone message today.  Magic  rallied 37 percent to HK$4.51 on its trading debut.
The company sold 200 million shares at HK$3.30 each, raising net
proceeds of HK$608 million ($78 million), according to a company
statement.  Initial Public Offering  MicroPort Scientific Corp.  jumped 36 percent to HK$8.29 in
its first trading day. The maker of equipment for keyhole
surgery sold 252.7 million shares at HK$6.10 apiece in an
initial public offering, raising net proceeds of HK$1.43 billion.  Changfeng Axle (China) Co. , another debutant, surged 13
percent to HK$4.50, after sliding as much as 3.8 percent.  HSBC , Europe’s biggest bank, lost 0.6 percent to HK$80.60.
 Michael Geoghegan  will step down as chief executive at the end
of the year, and be replaced by investment-banking head  Stuart Gulliver , said a person briefed on the matter, who spoke
anonymously because the changes haven’t been announced.  This week, spokesman  Patrick McGuinness  described as
“nonsense” a Financial Times report that Geoghegan had
threatened to quit if he wasn’t named chairman. The personnel
turnover was triggered by Chairman  Stephen Green ’s Sept. 7
decision to resign and become trade minister for the U.K. He
will be replaced by Finance Director  Douglas Flint , the person
said.  Lenovo Group Ltd. , China’s biggest maker of personal
computers, slipped 1.4 percent to HK$4.74. The company said the
pace of growth in the country’s PC market has seen a
“significant” drop after some strong gains.  Twenty-six stocks climbed while 17 dropped among the 45
members of the Hang Seng Index. Futures on the gauge rose 0.8
percent to 22,211.  To contact the reporter on this story:
