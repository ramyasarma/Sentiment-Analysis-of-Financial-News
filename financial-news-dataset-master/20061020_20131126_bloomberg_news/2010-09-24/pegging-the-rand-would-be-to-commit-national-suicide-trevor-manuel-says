Pegging the value of South Africa’s
rand would be to “commit national suicide,” said Trevor
Manuel, head of the country’s national planning commission and
member of the ruling African National Congress’s economic
transformation committee.  There is “no simple answer” to addressing the strength of
the rand and promoting exports, he told reporters in the eastern
port city of Durban today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
