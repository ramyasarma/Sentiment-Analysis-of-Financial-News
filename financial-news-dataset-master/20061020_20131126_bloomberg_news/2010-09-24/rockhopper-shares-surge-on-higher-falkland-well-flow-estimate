Rockhopper Exploration Plc , a U.K.
company searching for oil and gas off the Falkland Islands, rose
in London trading after doubling its estimate of the flow rate
from the Sea Lion 1 well.  The well could produce at 4,000 barrels a day without the
constraints of the original test, which had a maximum rate of
about 2,000 barrels a day, the company said today in a
statement. The shares are up  1,278 percent  since the first
announcement on the discovery in May.  “With a more optimal well location and horizontal well
completions, significantly higher flow rates could be achieved
from future production wells,” Rockhopper said.  The company has been one of the most successful explorers
in the Falklands, the U.K.-controlled region that Prime Minister
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to defend in 1982. Argentina still
claims sovereignty over the islands and rejected “illegal”
exploration there in May.  Rockhopper climbed 8.5 pence and traded at 510 pence as of
4:30 p.m. in London.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Falklands Oil & Gas Ltd.
and Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc are also exploring the
Falkland Islands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
