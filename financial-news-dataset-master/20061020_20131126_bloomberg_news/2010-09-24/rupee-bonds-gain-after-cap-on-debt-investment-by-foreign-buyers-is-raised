India’s rupee strengthened to the
highest level in more than four months and benchmark  bonds  rose
after policy makers yesterday raised the cap on overseas
investments in government and corporate securities.  The  finance ministry  said it would allow foreigners to
double holdings of government notes to $10 billion and increased
the ceiling on investments in corporate debt by a third to $20
billion. The move will help offset India’s  current-account
deficit , said  Ashutosh Raina , head of foreign-exchange trading
at HDFC Bank Ltd. The shortfall in the account widened to $13
billion in the first quarter from $12.2 billion in the three
months earlier, according to official data.  “The government’s measures should help increase capital
inflows,” said Mumbai-based Raina.  The rupee advanced 0.9 percent to 45.2550 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, the strongest level since May 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 7.8 percent bond due in May 2020 fell two
basis points to 7.87 percent, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price rose 0.16, or 16 paise, per 100 rupee
face amount to 99.51.  Offshore forwards indicated the rupee will trade at 45.91
to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
46.25 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled
in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
