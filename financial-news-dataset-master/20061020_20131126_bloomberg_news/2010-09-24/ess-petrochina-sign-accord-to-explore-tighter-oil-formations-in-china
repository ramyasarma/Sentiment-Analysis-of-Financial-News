Hess Corp. , the fifth-biggest U.S.
oil company, will explore for crude in China in cooperation with
that nation’s largest oil company, PetroChina Co.  Hess and PetroChina will work with dense rock in the Daqing
oil field, a formation that’s similar to the Bakken basin in
North Dakota, where Hess is already exploring,  Jay Wilson , a
Hess spokesman, said by telephone today.  Hess, based in New York, opened an office in Beijing
earlier this year and is looking for additional exploration and
production opportunities in cooperation with Beijing-based
PetroChina and other companies Wilson didn’t name.  “It’s a very fast-growing market for energy,” Wilson
said. “We’re looking to leverage our Bakken experience and
capability to grow our unconventional resource base globally.”  The China field may require horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing, which Hess uses in the U.S., Wilson said.
Fracturing injects water, sand and chemicals into rock to help
release the flow of oil and gas.  Hess produces more than 16,000 barrels of oil a day in the
Bakken formation. The company has similar exploration operations
in tight rocks in a basin near Paris and plans to start drilling
in France in the first quarter of next year, Wilson said.  Hess rose $1.76, or 3.1 percent, to $57.81 as of 4:15 p.m.
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. PetroChina
rose 1.3 percent to HK$8.82 in Hong Kong trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
