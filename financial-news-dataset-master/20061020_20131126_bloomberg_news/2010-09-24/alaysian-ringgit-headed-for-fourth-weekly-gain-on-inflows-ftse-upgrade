Malaysia’s ringgit was headed for a
fourth straight weekly advance on speculation global funds will
pump more money into Asia’s developing nations to profit from
the world’s fastest economic growth.  The currency traded near a 13-year high after FTSE Group, a
global index provider, yesterday upgraded Malaysia to “advanced
emerging market” status and Morgan Stanley on Sept. 20 raised
its assessment of the nation’s stocks to “overweight.” Asia
excluding Japan equity funds took in the most money in more than
15 months during the week ended Sept. 22, according to research
firm EPFR Global.  “We see the FTSE upgrade as one of the key catalysts for
further appreciation of the ringgit,” said  Wai Ho Leong , a
Singapore-based senior regional economist at Barclays Capital
Plc. “While Asia’s superior growth is a given, Malaysia stands
out for investors because of its asset-divestment program.”  The ringgit traded at 3.0985 per dollar as of 10:04 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, from 3.1005 yesterday and 3.1020 at the end of
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
reached 3.0873 yesterday, the strongest level since October 1997.  FTSE’s upgrade may attract as much as $3 billion of new
funds to Malaysian assets, Barclays wrote in a report published
yesterday. State oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. plans to
sell shares in a petrochemical unit that made a 2.6 billion
ringgit ($836 million) profit in the year ended March 31,
according to a prospectus for the sale.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in 2010,
outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in July.  The ringgit has appreciated 10.5 percent this year, the
best performance among Asia’s 10 most-active currencies. It may
appreciate to 2.92 over the next 12 months, Barclays’ Leong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
