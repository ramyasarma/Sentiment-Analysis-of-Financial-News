Belvedere SA said a ruling by a
court in Dijon on Sept. 21 may cause it to revise its asset-sale
calendar as it doesn’t have to pay interest on a floating rate
note maturing in 2013.  The company said it will appeal the court’s ruling to
validate the debt claimed by Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
