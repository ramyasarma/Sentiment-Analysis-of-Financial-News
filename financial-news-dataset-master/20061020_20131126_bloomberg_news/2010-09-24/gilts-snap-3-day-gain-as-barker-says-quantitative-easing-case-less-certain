U.K. 10-year government bonds
snapped a three-day gain after former Bank of England policy
maker  Kate Barker  said the case for more stimulus through asset
purchases is looking “less certain.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt trimmed its biggest weekly
drop in more than a month. “There is still more concern about
inflation staying high,” and the case for more so-called
quantitative easing is an “open question,” Barker said on CNBC
television yesterday. The yield on the 10-year gilt fell the
most in more than a year on Sept. 22 after the U.S. Federal
Reserve signaled it may resume asset purchases and the minutes
of the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting showed some Bank
of England officials said the economy may need more stimulus.  “There is this issue with inflation that is splitting the
MPC, and robust second-quarter growth means QE isn’t imminent,”
said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in London. “However, following the minutes, QE is
seen as more likely than it was a week or so ago.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt was 9 basis points higher at
3.04 percent at 4:24 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security
due March 2020 fell 0.775, or 7.75 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,569) face amount, to 113.91. The yield is down 9 basis
points this week, the most since the 5 days ending Aug. 20.  Two-year yields were 5 basis points higher at 0.69 percent,
and 1 basis point lower in the week.  Quantitative Easing  The Bank of England bought almost 200 billion pounds of
gilts between March 2008 and January this year to help pull the
U.K. out of its worst recession since World War II. While the
economy stopped shrinking in the fourth quarter of 2009 and
growth accelerated to the fastest pace in nine years in this
year’s second quarter, future cuts to government spending may
weigh on gross domestic product.  The British economy will grow slower than previously
forecast next year and the central bank won’t raise rates until
the second quarter, the Confederation of British Industry said
on Sept. 22.  U.K. gilts returned 3.4 percent this quarter, compared with
2.1 percent for German government bonds and 2.4 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America’s
Merrill Lynch unit.  The pound depreciated 0.4 percent to 85.24 pence per euro,
capping a 2 percent drop for the week, the biggest since the
five days ending May 21. Sterling climbed 0.9 percent against
the dollar to $1.5826.  To contact the reporters on this story:
