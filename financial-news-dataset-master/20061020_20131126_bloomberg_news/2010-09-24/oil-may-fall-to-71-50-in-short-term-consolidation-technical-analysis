Crude oil may fall next week on
speculation that U.S. inventories will climb as fuel demand
declines, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through Oct. 1. Nine respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted little change, and four estimated prices will rise.
Last week, 52 percent said crude would decrease.  Crude-oil supplies rose 970,000 barrels to 358.3 million
last week, leaving stockpiles 13 percent above the five-year
average for the period, the Energy Department said Sept. 22.
Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, also increased.  “The market may remain under pressure from this week’s
price-bearish DOE inventory release showing supply increases
across the board,” said  Jason Schenker , the president of
Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant.  Total consumption of petroleum products fell 1.8 percent to
19.2 million barrels a day last week, the department’s report
showed. Gasoline demand dropped 1.9 percent to 8.85 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since March.  Crude oil for November delivery increased 2.1 percent to
$76.49 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices are up 16 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
