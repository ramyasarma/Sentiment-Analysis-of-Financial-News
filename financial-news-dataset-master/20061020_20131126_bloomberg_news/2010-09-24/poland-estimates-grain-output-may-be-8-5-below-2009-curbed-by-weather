Grain output in Poland, the
European Union’s third-largest producer behind France and
Germany, may be 8.5 percent lower this year at 27.3 million
tons, curbed by smaller plantings and poor weather, the Warsaw-
based Central Statistical Office said today.  In its second crop production estimate for this year, the
statistical office estimated rapeseed output at about 2.1
million tons, 16.4 percent lower than in 2009. Sugar beet output
was estimated at 9.7 million tons, 10.7 percent lower than in
2009.  Wheat output may be 3.3 percent lower than last year at 9.5
million tons, the office said. Poland is the EU’s fourth-largest
wheat grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
