Hog futures rose for the first time
in three days as the dollar dropped, boosting prospects for U.S.
pork exports. Cattle declined.  The  greenback fell  to a seven-month low against a basket of
six major currencies. Pork exports this year through July were
5.6 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the most-
recent the U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed to the
highest level since January.  “The dollar can have a positive impact” on meat exports,
said  David Kruse , the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal, Iowa. “There seems to be good support in general in all
commodities.”  Hog futures for December settlement climbed 0.425 cent, or
0.6 percent, to settle at 76.45 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This week, the price gained 0.7
percent, the second straight gain. The most-active contract has
climbed 17 percent this year.  Hogs also rose before a USDA inventory report today showed
shrinking U.S. sow supplies. After markets closed in Chicago,
the USDA reported that producers cut their breeding herds in
August by 1.8 percent, more than the 1.5 percent decline
expected by 12 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Farmers began cutting herds in 2008 after losing money
because of high feed prices and shrinking pork demand during the
recession.  U.S. pork stockpiles plunged 27 percent in August from a
year earlier, the USDA said on Sept. 22.  Wholesale pork  prices
have climbed 34 percent this year.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.125 cent, or
0.1 percent, to 98.125 cents a pound. This week, the price
dropped 3.8 percent, the first decline since late August. The
commodity has climbed 14 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement dropped 0.75
cent, or 0.7 percent, to $1.091 a pound. Rising corn prices may
erode profit at feedlots, discouraging herd expansion, Kruse
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
