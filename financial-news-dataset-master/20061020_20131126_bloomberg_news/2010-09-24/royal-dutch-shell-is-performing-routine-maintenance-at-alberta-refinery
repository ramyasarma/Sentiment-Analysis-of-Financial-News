Royal Dutch Shell Plc  is conducting
routine planned maintenance on a unit at its Scotford refinery
near Edmonton, Alberta, according to a message the company left
on a community hot line.  The refinery may flare intermittently over the next five to
six hours, the company said in the message left at 9 a.m. local
time today. Flares are safety devices that allow the release of
pressure in processing units, preventing the pressure from
building inside the units.  The  refinery  is 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of
Edmonton, Alberta. It has a capacity of 98,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
