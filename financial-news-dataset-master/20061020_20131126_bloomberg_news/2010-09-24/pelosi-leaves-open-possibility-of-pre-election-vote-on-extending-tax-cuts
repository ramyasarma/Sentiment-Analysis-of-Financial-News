U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
left open the possibility that her chamber will vote on
extending the Bush-era tax cuts for middle-class Americans
before leaving to campaign for the Nov. 2 elections.  “We will retain the right to proceed as we choose, we will
take it one day at a time,” Pelosi of California told reporters
in Washington today. Yesterday, the second-ranking Senate
Democrat, Dick Durbin, said the Senate won’t be able to vote
before the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
