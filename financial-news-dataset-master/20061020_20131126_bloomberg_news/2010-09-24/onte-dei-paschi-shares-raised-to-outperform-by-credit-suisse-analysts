Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
SpA , Italy’s third-largest bank, was upgraded to “outperform”
from “neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG, which said that
“although the latest Basel III draft does not remove the risk
of a recapitalization for Monte dei Pasci and  Banco Popolare SC 
(BP IM), it does considerably reduce the size of a possible
capital raising.”  The brokerage kept an “outperform” rating on Banco
Popolare, while lifting its price estimate to 6.2 euros from 6
euros, according to a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
