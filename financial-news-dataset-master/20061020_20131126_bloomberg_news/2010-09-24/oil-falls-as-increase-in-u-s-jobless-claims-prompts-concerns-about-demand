Oil rose, heading for a weekly gain
in New York as a jump in German business confidence and an
increase in U.S. capital goods orders tempered concern that fuel
demand remains constrained by slack economic growth.  Prices may drop next week on speculation that U.S.
inventories will climb as fuel demand declines, a Bloomberg News
survey showed. Yesterday the U.S. Labor Department reported that
jobless claims unexpectedly increased last week. Still, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. sees demand strengthening globally and boosted its
price forecast for next year.  “We’re seeing risk sentiment swing back and forth in the
crude market,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , analyst with VTB
Capital in London. “We expect to see more macro-based trading
as we go ahead.”  The November contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange
rose as much as 93 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $76.11 a barrel and
was at $76.02 at 1:45 p.m. London time. The contract has risen
3.2 percent this week. Brent crude for November settlement
gained 77 cents to $78.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  Oil extended gains after a U.S. government report showed
orders for capital equipment rebounded in August, signaling that
a slowdown in business investment may be less severe than some
economists projected.  Tropical Storm  Seventeen of 30 analysts, or 57 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through Oct. 1. Nine respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted little change, and four estimated prices will rise.
Last week, 52 percent said crude would decrease.  Tropical Storm Matthew may approach hurricane strength
later today before hitting the Nicaragua-Honduras border along
its Caribbean coast and continuing on a course toward Belize and
Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula.  Matthew’s winds increased to 50 miles (85 kilometers) per
hour from 45 mph three hours earlier, the National Hurricane
Center said in a website  advisory  at 6 a.m. Honduras time. A
hurricane warning was in place from Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua
to Limon, Honduras, indicating winds of at least 74 mph are
expected within 36 hours.  JPMorgan boosted its Brent forecast for the fourth quarter
of this year to $83 a barrel, and expects the European
benchmark, which is used to price two-thirds of global oil, to
average $90 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2011, it said in a
research note today.  U.S. Inventories  Total  consumption of petroleum products  averaged 19.2
million barrels a day last week, down 1.8 percent from the seven
days ended Sept. 10, the Energy Department reported Sept. 22.
U.S. oil stockpiles rose 970,000 barrels to 358.3 million last
week. They were forecast to drop 1.75 million barrels, according
to the median of analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Futures may drop as low as $71.50 a barrel in a short-term
consolidation period, according to technical indicators used by
traders to predict price movements.  Oil will fall toward intraday lows of $74.25 a barrel
reached on Sept. 7 and $73.10 on Aug. 31, said  Stephanie Aymes ,
a London-based cross-commodity technical analyst at Societe
Generale SA. The top range of crude’s consolidation is $76.25 a
barrel, which is close to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the contract’s drop from its $83.91 high on Aug. 4 to $71.49
on Aug. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
