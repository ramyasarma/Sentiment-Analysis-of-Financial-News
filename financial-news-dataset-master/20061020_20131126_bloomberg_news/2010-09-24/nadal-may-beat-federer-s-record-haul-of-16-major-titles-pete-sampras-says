Rafael Nadal  may surpass  Roger Federer ’s men’s record haul of 16 major tennis titles,  Pete Sampras  said.  “If he’s smart with his schedule and the fact that he has
so many at such a young age, he could very well do it,” Sampras
told reporters on a conference call.  Nadal earlier this month became the seventh man to win all
four majors with his four-set victory over  Novak Djokovic  at the
U.S. Open final in New York. At 24, Nadal is also the youngest
winner of the career Grand Slam since tennis turned professional
in 1968. The Spaniard, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, has now
won 9 major championships, a mark Federer reached as a 25-year-
old.  The former top-ranked Sampras won 14 major singles titles.
The American’s record was surpassed by Federer last year at
Wimbledon, where the Swiss won his 15th Grand Slam title. Since
extending the men’s record to 16 by winning the Australian Open
at the start of the season, the 29-year-old Federer hasn’t made
it to a major singles final.  “It’s a huge goal, it’s a lot of majors, it’s a lot of
work,” Sampras said about Nadal. “Quite honestly, I don’t
think he really needs to. He’s won all the majors, he’s won the
Olympics, he’s dominated his main rival in Roger.”  Nadal leads Federer 14-7 in career meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
