Cotton futures rose the most in six
weeks on renewed signs that global demand will outpace limited
supplies. Orange juice gained.  The ratio of cotton to stockpiles will drop to 38 percent
in the coming season, the lowest in 15 years, compared with 40
percent a year earlier, Macquarie Group Ltd. said today in a
 report . Global production will increase to 116.97 million bales,
falling short of demand of 119.16 million bales, the bank said.
A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “It’s been a question of very tight supply and very high
demand at this time,” said  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta
Brokerage in New York. Cotton may rise above $1 a pound again,
he said.  Cotton for December delivery rose 2.76 cents, or 2.8
percent, to settle at 99.93 cents at 2:37 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, the biggest gain since Aug. 12. On Sept. 22,
the fiber reached $1.0334, a 15-year high. The commodity has
jumped 54 percent in the past year.  Yesterday, inventories in  warehouses  monitored by ICE rose
1.2 percent, the first increase since June 10. They have tumbled
96 percent this year. The U.S. is the biggest exporter, and
China is the top grower.  India, the world’s second-biggest cotton grower and
shipper, may limit exports to 5.5 million bales in the year
beginning Oct. 1 in a bid to meet domestic demand, Commerce
Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said this month. Global inventories will
drop 3.3 percent to 45.4 million bales in the year ending July
31, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Dollar’s Slump  Futures also climbed as the dollar’s slump bolstered the
appeal of U.S. exports.  Cotton is “also getting some help from the outside
markets,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at First
Capitol Group LLC in Atlanta. “Folks see the dollar down and
think, gosh, that makes cotton cheaper.”  The greenback dropped to the lowest level since February
against a basket of major currencies.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 1.1 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to settle at $1.582 a pound on ICE. The price
has gained 23 percent this year.  A tropical weather system may form in the western Caribbean
next week, boosting the risk of damage to citrus groves in
Florida, the world’s second-largest orange grower, according to
a forecaster at MDA EarthSat Weather Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
