Andrei Kostin, chief executive
officer of VTB Group, Russia’s second largest bank, said he
hopes that a new investment unit in Hong Kong can start by year-
end, Xinhua News Agency said, citing an interview with Kostin.  The stock exchanges of Hong Kong and Shanghai are very
attractive as alternatives to London and New York for Russian
companies seeking to raise capital, Kostin said, as cited by
Xinhua. Russia and China need to speed up reciprocal investment
cooperation as bilateral trade increases, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
