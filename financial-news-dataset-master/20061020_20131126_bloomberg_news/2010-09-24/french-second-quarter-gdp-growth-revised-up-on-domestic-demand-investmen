France’s economy grew faster than
originally estimated in the second quarter, powered by consumer
spending, government investment and exports.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.7 percent in the three months
through June instead of the 0.6 percent originally estimated,
Paris-based statistics office Insee said today. Exports rose 2.8
percent, exceeding the 2.7 percent posted last month. Spending
by government agencies rose 0.4 percent rather than the 0.3
percent estimated Aug. 13.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s tax cut for businesses boosted
companies’ margins at the beginning of the year, helping to fuel
hiring and higher wages in the second quarter. France’s
performance still lagged behind Germany, its biggest trading
partner, which expanded 2.2 percent in the second quarter.  GDP expanded 1.7 percent from a year earlier, unchanged
from the original estimate, Insee said. Gross household income
rose 0.9 percent in the quarter, up from a 0.6 percent increase
in the first, and inflation slowed, improving purchasing power,
Insee said.  “This upturn results in part from an expansion of the
workforce,” Insee said. It also is helped “to a lesser degree,
by a slower increase in taxes on income and assets.”  The euro was little changed at 9:04 a.m. in Paris, trading
at $1.3322.  France’s economy has expanded for five straight quarters
after a yearlong recession that was the worst since World War
II. Total investment by companies and households increased for
the first time in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
