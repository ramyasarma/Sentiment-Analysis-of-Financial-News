Spain will raise taxes on the
highest earners and cut spending in the most austere budget in
at least three decades to slash the euro region’s third-largest
deficit. The government raised its jobless forecast and left its
economic-growth estimate unchanged.  The budget creates two new brackets for taxpayers earning
more than 120,000 euros ($161,120) and 175,000 euros that will
generate as much as 200 million euros, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said in Madrid after the Cabinet approved the plan
today. Spending will fall 3 percent from 2010, she said.  “The amounts that the ministries will have at their
disposal for the spending they need to carry out will be the
equivalent of what they had in 2006,” she told reporters.  Spain’s Socialist government is trying to show it can trim
the  deficit  to 6 percent of gross domestic product next year
from 11.2 percent in 2009 without strangling an economy that’s
emerging from an almost two-year recession. The task has become
more urgent as doubts resurface about high-deficit euro members’
finances. The perceived riskiness of Portuguese and Irish bonds
rose to euro-era records today.  “While the government appears to have made inroads into
its budget deficit this year, there remains a risk that growth
is weaker than the government expects in 2011, potentially
leading it to slip behind target,” said  Ben May , an economist
at Capital Economics in London.  Growth Forecasts  Salgado stuck to forecasts for  GDP  growth of 1.3 percent
next year, more than twice the 0.6 percent forecast by the
International Monetary Fund. The plan also maintains targets for
deficit reduction, while predicting a lower debt than outlined
in February. Unemployment, now the highest in Europe at 20.3
percent, will be 19.3 percent in 2011, more than the previous
forecast of 18.9 percent.  The  central  government shortfall fell by almost half to 2.4
percent in the first seven months of the year, according to
Finance Ministry data. The overall public budget used in
international comparisons includes regional administrations’
shortfalls and the balance of the social security system.  Salgado reduced her forecasts for the debt burden to 62.8
percent of GDP this year and 68.7 percent in 2011. In February
she had forecast debt would amount to 71.9 percent in 2011.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year bonds rather than similar maturity German fell to 181 basis
points from 184 basis points yesterday.  Risk Premium  Portugal’s risk premium with Germany reached a euro-era
record 419 basis points today, more than twice the Spanish
level. Spain’s spread has closed from its record of 232 basis
points on June 17.  The budget will go to parliament on Sept. 30, where the
ruling Socialists lack a majority and are seeking the support of
the Basque Nationalist Party.  The central government, which accounts for half of income
taxes, leaving the other half to regions, will raise its rate on
incomes above 120,000 euros to 22.5 percent from 21.5 percent;
on incomes above 175,000 euros, the rate rises to 23.5 percent.  Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  took measures
in May to knock 10 billion euros off next year’s deficit, in a
policy U-turn agreed to as part of the creation of an almost $1
trillion financial backstop for euro nations hit by contagion
from Greece’s fiscal crisis. Zapatero slashed public wages 5
percent, announced a freeze on all but the lowest pensions in
2011 and scrapped subsidies for new mothers.  As the country aims to cut the deficit by the most since at
least 1980, its coffers will also get a boost next year from a
sales-tax increase that came into effect in July.  The government stuck to its plan to reduce the shortfall to
6 percent next year, 4.4 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013,
in line with the European Union limit. It revised the 2009
deficit down to 11.1 percent from a previous 11.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
