Cegedim SA, a medical information-
services provider, tumbled the most in eight years in Paris
trading after saying it’s “no longer” aiming to improve its
margin for 2010 based on its first-half results.  Cegedim sank 15 percent to 47.88 euros as of 9:17 a.m. in
Paris, its biggest drop since 2002. The Boulogne, France-based
company posted net income for the first half of the year of 19.9
million euros, compared with 17.2 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
