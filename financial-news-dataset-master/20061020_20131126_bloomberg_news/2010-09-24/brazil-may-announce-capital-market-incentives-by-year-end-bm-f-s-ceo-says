Brazil’s government may announce
incentives for the capital markets by year-end in a bid to
reduce costs for companies and investors,  BM&FBovespa SA  Chief
Executive Officer  Edemir Pinto  said.  Brazil’s government imposed a 2 percent tax on overseas
investors’ purchases of equities and bonds in October 2009 to
stem a rally in the real and reduce foreign inflows into the
stock market.  “We want to end the financial tax on foreign investors,”
Pinto, head of the Latin American exchange, told reporters in
Sao Paulo today. “We are in talks with the government and BNDES
on the incentives,” he said, referring to the state development
bank.  Brazil’s benchmark index rose 2 percent from October 19,
when the levy was announced, through the end of 2009. That
compares with an 83 percent gain in the whole of 2009 and a 0.6
percent increase so far this year.  The index, known as Ibovespa, rose 0.4 percent to 69,034
points at 12:14 p.m. New York time, while BM&FBovespa’s shares
fell 3 percent to 14.45 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
