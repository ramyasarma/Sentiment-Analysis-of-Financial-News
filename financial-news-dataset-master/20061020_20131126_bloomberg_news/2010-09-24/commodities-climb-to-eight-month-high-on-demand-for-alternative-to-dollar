Commodities rose to an eight-month
high as the dollar’s slump boosted demand for grains and metals
as alternative investments.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose as
much as 1.3 percent to the highest level since Jan. 15. Gold
futures rose to a record, topping $1,300 an ounce, and silver
futures jumped to a 30-year high. Corn, soybeans, wheat and
cotton rallied.  The greenback fell to the lowest level since February
against a basket of major currencies. Orders for U.S. capital
equipment rebounded and German business confidence improved,
fueling demand for higher-yielding assets. The Federal Reserve
has kept borrowing costs low and may take more steps on monetary
policy to bolster the U.S. economy.  “Investors were sitting on the sidelines just waiting for
the dollar to break, and now people are jumping on the
bandwagon” for commodities, said  Daniel Pavilonis , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  The CRB rose 3.7, or 1.3 percent, to 283.84 at 1:43 p.m.
New York time. Earlier, the gauge reached 283.9.  The dollar’s slide enhanced the allure of precious metals
as alternatives currencies and improved prospects for U.S.
agriculture exports. The CRB has climbed 7.4 percent this month,
and the dollar has dropped 4.6 percent.  “Dollar weakness is propelling all of the commodity
markets,” said  Bill O’Grady , the chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “Commodities
aren’t being purchased for end usage, but as a store of value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
