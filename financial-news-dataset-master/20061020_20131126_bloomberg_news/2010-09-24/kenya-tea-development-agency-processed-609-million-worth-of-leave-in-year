Kenya Tea Development Agency, the
nation’s biggest grower of the leaves, processed 49.4 billion
shillings of the leaves in the year through June, Managing
Director Lerionka Tiampati said.  That compares with 36.4 billion shillings of tea a year
earlier, Tiampati told reporters today in the capital, Nairobi.  The price of processed tea increased to 233 shillings for a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) compared with 185 shillings a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
