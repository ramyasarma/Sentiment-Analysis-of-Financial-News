China will send a chartered flight
to collect the captain of a Chinese fishing boat who was
detained in Japan, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a
statement on its website today.  Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for the ministry, reiterated
China’s view that Japan’s “so-called judicial proceedings” in
the case were illegal and invalid. Japan announced today the
release of the captain, Zhan Qixiong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
