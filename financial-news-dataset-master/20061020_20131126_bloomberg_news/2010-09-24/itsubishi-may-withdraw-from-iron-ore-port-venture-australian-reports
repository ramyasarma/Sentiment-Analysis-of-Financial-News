Mitsubishi Corp. may pull out from
a A$4 billion ($3.8 billion) Oakajee Port & Rail Pty iron ore
port venture with Australia’s Murchison Metals Ltd. because of
doubts on its economic viability, the Australian reported,
without citing anyone. The iron ore has proven to be of lower
quality than expected, making it more expensive to bring into
production, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
