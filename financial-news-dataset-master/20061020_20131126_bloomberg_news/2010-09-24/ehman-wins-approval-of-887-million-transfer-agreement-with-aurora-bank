Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the
bankrupt investment bank, won court approval of a settlement
agreement to transfer $887 million in cash and assets to its
Delaware-based Aurora Bank FSB, according to court documents.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  James Peck  in New York approved the
agreement, which also calls for Lehman to ensure that Aurora
maintains certain capital levels and to buy all the banks non-
cash assets in certain circumstances after an 18-month period,
according to the filing today.  Lehman said in a September filing that agreements with
Aurora Bank and Woodlands Commercial Bank in Salk Lake City were
crucial to preserving the value of its ownership stakes in the
banks, which Lehman has agreed to sell or close. The banks have
depended on Lehman financing to avoid seizure by regulators.  If the banks can’t be sold, they will be dissolved, with
Lehman buying their non-cash assets, according to court papers.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
