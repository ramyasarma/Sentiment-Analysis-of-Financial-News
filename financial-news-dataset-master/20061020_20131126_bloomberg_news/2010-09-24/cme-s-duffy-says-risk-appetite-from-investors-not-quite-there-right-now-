CME Group Inc. , the world’s largest
futures market, said investor appetite for risk is “not quite
there right now” as concern about the global economy increases
demand for Treasuries and haven assets.  “I think a lot of people are still hurting” from the
global financial crisis in 2008, CME Executive Chairman  Terry Duffy  said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Linzie Janis
today. The appetite “is not what it was pre-2008.”  U.S. stocks declined the most in two weeks yesterday as an
unexpected jump in U.S. jobless claims and weaker-than-forecast
growth in Europe’s service and manufacturing industries
overshadowed improvement in American home sales and economic
indicators. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  lost 0.8 percent to
1,124.83 in New York. Gold for immediate delivery advanced to a
record $1,296.30 an ounce on Sept. 22.  “There is no question you see a lot of money is coming out
of U.S. equities going into the government Treasuries and things
of that nature will tell you that the risk appetite is not quite
there,” said Duffy, who is on a tour of Asia.  The Chicago-based company may double its staff in Europe to
250 by 2012 and plans to increase the size of its Singapore
office “significantly” by the first quarter of 2011,  Bob Ray ,
managing director of international products and services at CME,
said in an interview Sept. 8. The exchange’s average daily
volume dropped 20 percent last year even as international
trading rose 20 percent, he said.  Average daily trading volume at CME climbed 31 percent in
the second quarter, led by an 82 percent jump in currency
futures and a 38 percent surge in interest-rate contracts, the
company said July 2.  -- With assistance from  Nandini Sukumar  in London. Editor:  James Poole
