Natural gas futures fell for the
first time in four days on signs that Tropical Storm Matthew
will avoid energy pipelines and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  The storm was about to come onshore near the Nicaragua-
Honduras border with winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour,
the  National Hurricane Center  said in a 2 p.m. advisory. Matthew
has a 10 percent chance of becoming a major threat to Gulf
energy production, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat
Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.  “The storm is staying a lot farther south than people
thought it would,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFG Best in
Chicago. “It’s not a concern for gas traders, who are taking
the hurricane premium out of the market going into the
weekend.”  Natural gas for October delivery settled 13.8 cents lower,
or 3.4 percent, at $3.881 per million British thermal units at
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures dropped 3.6 percent
this week.  Matthew is no longer likely to become a hurricane,
according to the Hurricane Center. The storm may move into
northern Honduras tomorrow, the center said.  About 10 percent of U.S. gas output will come from federal
waters in the Gulf of Mexico this year, down from 17 percent
five years ago, according to Energy Department data.  U.S. Supplies  Gas stockpiles  rose 73 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 17 to 3.34 trillion cubic feet, 6.2 percent above the
five-year average, an Energy Department report yesterday showed.  Inventories will peak at 3.687 trillion cubic feet before
cold-weather demand prompts utilities to pull gas from storage,
the department predicted in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  on Sept. 8. Stockpiles rose to a record 3.837 trillion
cubic feet last November.  U.S. gas  production  in May totaled 1.92 trillion cubic
feet, the highest level since 1974, according to department
data.  Gas traders seem to “be inclined to see a perpetual state
of oversupply, even though storage levels are 5 percent lower
than a year ago,” wrote  Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi
Futures Perspective in New York, in a note to clients.  Temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S. may be mostly
normal from Sept. 30 through Oct. 4, according to WSI Corp., a
forecasting company in Andover, Massachusetts. The high
temperature in New York on Oct. 1 may be 71 degrees Fahrenheit
(22 Celsius), compared with an average high of 69 degrees.  About 53 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Henry Hub  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 11.6 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $3.9647 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
191,924 as of 2:43 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
255,000. Volume was 281,811 yesterday. Open interest was 784,186
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 805,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data on the Intercontinental Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
