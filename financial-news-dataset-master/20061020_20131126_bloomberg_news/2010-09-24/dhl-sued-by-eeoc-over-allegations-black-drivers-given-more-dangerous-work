The U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission sued DHL Express (USA) Inc., alleging it
discriminated against black Chicago-area employees by giving
them worse assignments than their white counterparts.  The EEOC has received more than 20 complaints of
discrimination against the U.S. unit of Bonn-based  Deutsche Post
AG , including the allegation that black drivers were dispatched
to predominantly black neighborhoods, and white drivers to white
neighborhoods, according to a statement issued by the agency
today.  “DHL assigned more difficult and dangerous work to black
employees than white employees,” violating federal civil rights
laws, EEOC regional attorney John Hendrickson said in the
statement.  The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Chicago, seeks
a class-status on behalf of about 150 black DHL workers in the
Chicago area, a court order barring the discriminatory practices
and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  The maximum recovery for any one individual would be
$300,000, Hendrickson said in a phone interview.  Bea Garcia, a DHL Express spokeswoman, , said in an
e-mailed statement that the company doesn’t comment on pending
litigation.  “That said, DHL’s policies provide equal employment
opportunities to all employees and comply with all applicable
federal, state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in
employment,” Garcia said.  The case is Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. DHL
Express (USA) Inc., 10-cv-06139, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
