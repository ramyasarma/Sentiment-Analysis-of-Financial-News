China Medical System Holdings Ltd. ,
which provides pharmaceutical services, raised about HK$1
billion ($129 million) in a Hong Kong initial share sale after
selling stock at the top of a range offered to investors,
according to two people familiar with the sale.  The Shenzhen, southern China-based company sold 200 million
shares at HK$5.06 apiece, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information was private. China Medical
System offered the stock at HK$3.60-HK$5.06 each, according to
its IPO prospectus.  UBS AG  managed the initial sale, the prospectus said. Chris
Cockerill, a UBS spokesman in Hong Kong, declined to comment.  China Medical System  plans to delist from London’s
Alternative Investment Market on Sept. 28 and start trading in
Hong Kong on the same day with the ticker 867 HK, according to
the prospectus. Calls to the company’s head office in Shenzhen
went unanswered today, a public holiday for mainland China.  The stock sold included 170 million new shares and 30
million shares from Lam Kong, chairman and controlling
shareholder of China Medical System, according to the prospectus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
