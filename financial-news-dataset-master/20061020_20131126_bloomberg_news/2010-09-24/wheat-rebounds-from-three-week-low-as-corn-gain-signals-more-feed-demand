Wheat jumped the most in two weeks
on speculation that demand will increase from livestock
producers as the cost of corn-based animal feed rose.  Corn futures gained 4.5 percent today in Chicago, after
touching a 23-month high on Sept. 20, as signs of U.S. economic
growth spur demand for feed and crop-based fuel. Demand for
wheat from the U.S., the world’s  largest exporter , has increased
this year after wet weather in Canada and the worst Russian
drought in 50 years curbed global output. Wheat has rallied 50
percent since the end of June.  “If you get a corn bounce, you get a wheat bounce,” said
 Darrell Holaday , the president of Advanced Market Concepts in
Manhattan, Kansas. “I’m certainly not bearish corn, so I don’t
see how you can get real bearish wheat for a while.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 22.75 cents, or
3.3 percent, to close at $7.20 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain since Sept. 9.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 22.5 cents, or 4.5
percent, to $5.2175 a bushel on the CBOT. On Sept. 20, the price
reached $5.2375, the highest level since Sept. 30, 2008.  A weaker dollar also helped boost grain prices by making
U.S. exports more attractive to overseas buyers, and by boosting
demand for alternative investments. The  dollar  slid as much as
0.9 percent to a seven-month low against a basket of six major
currencies.  “The dollar is supportive,” said  Larry Young , the
president of Covenant Trading LLC in Chicago. “It definitely
makes our exports attractive. Some of this is covering before
the end of month and the end of the quarter. I’d much rather
close the quarter with a nice winning trade.”  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
