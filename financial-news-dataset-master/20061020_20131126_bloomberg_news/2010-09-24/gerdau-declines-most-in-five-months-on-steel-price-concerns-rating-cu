Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, fell the most in five months in Sao Paulo trading
after its rating was lowered at Bank of America Corp., which
cited a “weak” outlook for prices.  Gerdau plunged 4.6 percent, the most since April 27, to
22.61 reais as of the 4 p.m. New York time close. The stock was
cut to “underperform” from “neutral.”  Brazilian steel prices will probably fall in the fourth
quarter as rising imports boost competition,  Felipe Hirai  and
 Thiago Lofiego , analysts at Bank of America in Sao Paulo, wrote
in a note to clients today. Gerdau’s earnings in the second half
“are likely going to disappoint” because of higher raw-
material costs, the analysts wrote.  “Prices are lagging cost increases,” the analysts wrote.
“As demand growth slows down and excessive premium attracts
higher imports, we believe Gerdau is going to be forced to
reduce prices or offer discounts.”  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA , Brazil’s second-
biggest steelmaker, fell the most since Sept. 14, losing 1.8
percent to 44.35 reais. Usiminas, as the company is known, has
suffered rating cuts from at least five banks since July on
concern steelmakers’ profit margins will narrow because of
rising costs and falling prices. Bank of America last month
lowered its recommendation to “neutral” from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
