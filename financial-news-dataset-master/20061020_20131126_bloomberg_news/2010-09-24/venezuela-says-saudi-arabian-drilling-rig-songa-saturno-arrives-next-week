Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, said the $2.5 billion Songa Saturno offshore
platform leased from Petrosaudi Oil Services Ltd. will arrive in
the South American country Sept. 28.  Petrosaudi’s Songa Saturno platform, which will be used to
develop offshore natural-gas resources, joins the Petrosaudi
Discover rig in replacing the Aban Pearl platform that sank near
Trinidad and Tobago in May, Oil and Energy Minister Rafael
Ramirez said, according to a company statement sent by e-mail
late last night.   A PDVSA-Petrosaudi venture, where the Venezuelan company
would have a majority stake, will eventually purchase the two
rigs, the statement said, citing Ramirez. The $2.5 billion
investment for the Songa Saturno rig covers a five-year period,
the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
