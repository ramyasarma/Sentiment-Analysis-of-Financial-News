The cost of protecting corporate
and sovereign bonds from default in Asia and Australia climbed,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 3 basis points to 126 basis points
as of 8:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, Credit Agricole CIB prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to 123
basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to ICAP Plc.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index, which rolled to a new series
this week, was at 100.5 basis points as of 10 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to BNP Paribas SA. Japan was shut yesterday for a
public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
