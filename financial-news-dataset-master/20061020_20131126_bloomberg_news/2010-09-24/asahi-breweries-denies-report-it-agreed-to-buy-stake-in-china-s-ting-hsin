Asahi Breweries Ltd.  denied a media
report it will buy a stake in Chinese foodmaker Ting Hsin
International Group.  The report isn’t true and the company wasn’t the source,
Tokyo-based Asahi, Japan’s second-largest brewer, said in a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  Asahi agreed to pay as much as 100 billion yen ($1.2
billion) for 10 percent of the instant-noodle maker and operator
of FamilyMart convenience stores in China, Nikkei English News
reported today, without saying how it got the information.  Asahi is spending as much as 400 billion yen expanding
overseas to limit the impact of stalling growth in Japan, where
the beer market has contracted 16 percent from its 1994 peak.
The brewer agreed last month to pay A$364 million ($345 million)
for Australia’s P&N Beverages to cement its position as that
nation’s No. 2 soft-drink maker.  Dongwon Group of South Korea has expressed interest in
buying a stake in soft-drink maker Haitai Beverage Co. from
Asahi, the Korea Economic Daily reported today, citing
unidentified industry officials. Asahi owns 58 percent of Seoul-
based Haitai.  Takayuki Tanaka , a Tokyo-based spokesman for Asahi,
declined to comment on the Korea Economic Daily report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
