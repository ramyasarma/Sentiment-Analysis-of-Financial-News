Representative  Dave Camp , the top
Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he will
vote for the China currency legislation the panel is preparing
to act on today.  Camp, of Michigan, said that changes to the measure resolve
concerns about the bill’s legality under World Trade
Organization rules.  The bill would let companies petition for duties on imports
to compensate for what lawmakers say is a weak yuan that gives
Chinese companies an unfair subsidy over their U.S. competitors.
Democratic leaders intend to bring the bill to the House floor
for a vote next week, according to aides who were briefed on the
schedule.  Committee Chairman  Sander Levin , a Michigan Democrat, said
China’s “persistent manipulation” of its currency is a
distortion of global trade and any threat of retaliation by
China would violate WTO rules.  The bill is H.R. 2378.  To contact the reporter on this story:
