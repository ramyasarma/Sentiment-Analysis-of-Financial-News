The yen dropped against most of its
major counterparts after Kyodo News cited an unidentified market
source as saying Japan sold the currency to protect exporters.  The currency slid as much as 1.1 percent against the dollar
in the biggest intraday decline since Japan intervened on Sept.
15 before erasing its drop. The euro advanced against the dollar
after a report showed German business confidence unexpectedly
rose to the highest level in more than three years.  “It seems there was some mild intervention today,” said
 Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at UniCredit SpA
in Milan. “We can imagine that the Bank of Japan will intervene
again in more depth, so traders should be very cautious.”  The yen slid 0.7 percent to 113.14 per euro at 7:03 a.m. in
New York, from 112.35 yesterday. Japan’s currency traded at
84.37 per dollar, compared with 84.38, after sliding to 85.40.
The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.3411, from $1.3314.  To contact the reporters on this story:
