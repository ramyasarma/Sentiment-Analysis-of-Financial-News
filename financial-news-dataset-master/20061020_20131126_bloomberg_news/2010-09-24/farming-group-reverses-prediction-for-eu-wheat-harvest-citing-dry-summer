The European Union wheat harvest
will fall 1.7 percent this year, farming association Copa-Cogeca
said, reversing a prediction for a bigger crop after a dry
summer slashed yields in France and Germany.  Overall wheat production will drop to 134.7 million metric
tons in 2010-11 from 137.1 million tons a year earlier, the
Brussels-based group said in an e-mailed report today. It had
forecast a 2.7 percent increase in June.  Soft-wheat yields fell in France, Germany, the U.K. and
Poland, the EU’s biggest producers, after hot and dry weather
across western Europe in June and July was followed by above-
average rainfall during harvesting in the region’s north.  “Production is much less than originally forecast,” Paul
Temple, chairman of Copa-Cogeca’s cereals working group, said in
the statement. “The bad climatic conditions have also had a
negative impact on cereal quality across the EU.”  The soft-wheat crop in the 27-nation bloc will fall 1.5
percent to 126.4 million tons, while output of the harder durum
variety is expected to drop 4.4 percent to 8.33 million tons,
the group said.  Less Barley  EU farmers will reap 53.8 million tons of barley this year,
down 10 percent from the prior year, Copa-Cogeca said, compared
with the 7.1 percent decline forecast in June. The corn harvest
will retreat 4.5 percent to 54.2 million tons, it said, more
than the previous outlook for a 2.9 percent drop.  The group now expects overall EU grain production to fall 5
percent to 274.1 million tons, more than triple its June
estimate for a reduction of 1.3 percent.  The 2010-11 rapeseed harvest will drop 4 percent to 19.8
million tons on lower yields, according to Copa-Cogeca.
Production of seed from sunflowers, which generally mature after
rapeseed and grains, is forecast to climb 3.5 percent to 7
million tons as yields improve, it said.  Weather may affect production next year, according to the
lobby group, which was formed by a 1962 merger of two
associations representing farmers and national agricultural
cooperatives in what was then the European Economic Community.  “Seed-bed conditions are not ideal in many countries and
could affect next year’s harvest,” the group said. “Copa-
Cogeca expects a drop in the rapeseed area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
