Jamaica may sell bonds this year
after borrowing costs fell to a four month-low, according to
Jamaica Prime Minister  Bruce Golding .  “We’re looking at the market this year,”  Golding , who was
elected in 2007, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York today.  Finance Minister  Audley Shaw  will be travelling to Europe
in October to gauge interest, he said. “We certainly want to
speak with investors before we take that decision,” Golding
said.  The extra  yield  investors demand to own Jamaican government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 494 at 1:15 p.m. New York time. The
difference shrank to 476 points last week, the lowest level
since May 17.  Jamaica plans to tap international credit markets as the
Caribbean country faces $400 million of debt maturing in May,
Golding said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
