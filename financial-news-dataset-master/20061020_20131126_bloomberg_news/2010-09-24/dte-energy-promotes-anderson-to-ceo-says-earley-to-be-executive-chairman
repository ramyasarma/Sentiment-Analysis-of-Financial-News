DTE Energy Co. , Michigan’s largest
utility owner, promoted  Gerard M. Anderson  to chief executive
officer, effective Oct. 1.  Anderson, 52, will replace  Anthony F. Earley Jr. , who will
become executive chairman, Detroit-based DTE said today in a
statement. The new CEO, who is currently president and chief
operating officer, has been with DTE since 1993. Earley, 61, has
been CEO and chairman since 1998.  Anderson will lead DTE amid an economic slump that pushed
Michigan’s unemployment  rate  to as high as 14.5 percent last
year. Three Michigan cities rank among the nation’s top 13 in
rate of population decline, according to Census Bureau
estimates. The state’s jobless rate, at 13.1 percent in August,
ranked behind only Nevada’s, the U.S. Labor Department reported.  Prior to joining  DTE  in 1993, Anderson was a consultant at
McKinsey & Co., specializing in the energy industry and
financial institutions.  DTE rose 37 cents to $45.84 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The  stock  has climbed 5.2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
