Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said excessive borrowing by banks and investment in
real estate leading up to the recession make the U.S. economic
recovery slow and difficult.  “You had this huge growth in leverage in the financial
system, huge overinvestment in real estate in parts of the
country, and those things made the crisis much more acute. But
more relevant for us now, they make the recovery harder,”
Geithner said at a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce conference
in Dallas today. “They make it slower, longer, more uneven, and
that’s the challenge we’re dealing with today.”  Parts of the economy, including exports and private
investment, are “really quite strong” even if “it is a very
tough economy still,” Geithner said.  Orders for U.S. capital equipment rebounded in August,
signaling a slowdown in business investment may be less severe
than some economists projected. Bookings for goods such as
computers and communications gear climbed 4.1 percent after a
5.3 percent decline in July that was smaller than previously
estimated, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington.  Total orders dropped 1.3 percent, depressed by volatile
demand for aircraft, and bookings excluding transportation
equipment rose more than forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
