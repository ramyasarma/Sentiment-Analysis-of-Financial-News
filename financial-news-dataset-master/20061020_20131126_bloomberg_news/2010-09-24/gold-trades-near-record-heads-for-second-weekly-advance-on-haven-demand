Gold climbed to a record in London
and New York as investors sought a protection of wealth and an
alternative to a weakening dollar. Silver rose to the highest
price since 1980 in London.  The dollar headed for a weekly drop against the euro on
concern the Federal Reserve is moving closer to boosting debt
purchases, while European equities declined. The metal, which
usually moves inversely to the greenback, advanced to a record
for the fourth day this week. Silver, also used in industrial
applications, headed for a fifth weekly advance.  “Gold is showing there is no confidence in the dollar,”
said  Bernard Sin , head of currency and metal trading at bullion
refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. Recent “data has been showing
signs of a troubled economy. That’s why we’ve seen this huge
buying for investors as a safe haven.”  Immediate-delivery bullion added as much as $5.90, or 0.5
percent, to $1,298.35 an ounce and traded at $1,296.95 at 9:32
a.m. in London. Gold for December delivery was 0.2 percent
higher after reaching $1,299.70 an ounce on the Comex in New
York.  Silver for immediate delivery in London climbed as much as
1.2 percent to $21.3875 an ounce, the highest price since
October 1980.  Gold, up 18 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak since at
least 1920. Bullion has outperformed global equities, Treasuries
and most industrial metals, prompting record investments in
gold-backed exchange-traded products. The metal rallied as
central banks and governments maintained low borrowing costs and
spent trillions of dollars to stimulate their economies.  ‘Every Opportunity’  The dollar slipped to a five-month low against the euro on
Sept. 22 after the Fed left its benchmark interest-rate target
at a record low and pledged to take more steps to spur growth if
necessary. The greenback fell as much as 0.6 percent today.  Gold “is continuing to appreciate at every opportunity,”
 Darren Heathcote , head of trading at Investec Bank (Australia)
Ltd. in Sydney, said today by phone. “We didn’t manage to break
and test $1,300 but certainly it looks like it is still on the
cards and could happen as soon as today, given the sentiment at
the moment is still one of uncertainty.”  While a report yesterday showed U.S. home sales were
slightly stronger than economists had forecast, the number of
Americans seeking unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose in the
week ended Sept. 18 and Europe’s services and manufacturing
industries slowed this month more than economists forecast.  Gold, Inflation  Global holdings  of gold by ETPs lost 1.41 metric tons to
2,088.32 tons yesterday, after reaching a record 2,089.74 tons
on Sept. 22, according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers. Gold
is also benefiting from central bank buying, World Gold Council
Managing Director  Marcus Grubb  told  Maryam Nemazee  on Bloomberg
Television’s “On the Move.”  Sixteen of 23 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 70 percent, said the metal will increase next
week. Six forecast lower prices for the metal and one was
neutral.  Prices have gained this year even as U.S. inflation slowed.
Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising
consumer prices. Inflation expectations, based on the  10-year 
U.S. Treasury breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.81 percent from
2.25 percent six months ago.  Silver last traded up 1.1 percent at $21.3475 in London.
The metal is up 27 percent this year. Silver futures added as
much as 1 percent to $21.43 on the Comex in New York, the
highest level since March 2008.  Silver ‘Undervalued’  “Silver is very much undervalued,” MKS Finance’s Sin
said. “It’s trading on the back of gold.”  Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust, the biggest ETP
backed by silver, jumped 73.04 tons to a record 9,582.59 tons
yesterday, according to figures on the company’s website. The
metal doubles as a store of value and as a raw material for
industry.  Platinum added 0.2 percent to $1,643.25 an ounce. Prices
reached $1,645.75 yesterday, the highest level since May 19.
Palladium gained 1.5 percent to $559 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
