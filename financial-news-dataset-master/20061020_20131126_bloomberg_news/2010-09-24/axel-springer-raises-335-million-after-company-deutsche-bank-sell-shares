Axel Springer AG , Europe’s largest
newspaper publisher, said it raised about 250 million euros
($335 million) after the company and Deutsche Bank AG sold
shares to investors.  About 5.48 million shares, or 16.6 percent of the share
capital, were sold by Axel Springer and Deutsche Bank at 92
euros apiece, according to a statement today. That brings the
portion of stock that is freely tradable to 41 percent.  Axel Springer “intends to use the proceeds to fund its on-
going digitalization and internationalization strategy,” it
said in today’s statement. The company raised its full-year
forecast in July after generating higher first-half earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 261
million euros.  Deutsche Bank was the sole bookrunner on the sale, while
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley were co-bookrunners,
according to a term sheet of the transaction obtained by
Bloomberg News. Commerzbank AG, ING Groep NV, Banca
IMI SpA, Mediobanca SpA and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg were
co-lead managers.  Axel Springer slipped 2.2 percent to 92.69 euros as of 2:27
p.m. in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of about
3.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
