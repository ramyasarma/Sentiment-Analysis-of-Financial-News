Investors should sell the euro
against the Swiss franc, targeting 1.27, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  The trade should be abandoned if the euro closes above 1.34
francs, strategists led by London-based Thomas Stolper  wrote in
an e-mailed note today.  The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 1.3145 per euro as of
9:57 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
