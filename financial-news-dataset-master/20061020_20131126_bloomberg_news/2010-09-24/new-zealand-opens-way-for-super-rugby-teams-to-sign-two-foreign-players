New Zealand’s five Super Rugby
teams will be able to contract two foreign players for the first
time in next year’s expanded provincial competition.  “This gives some flexibility to franchises in their
recruitment and contracting as the new Super Rugby
competition develops,”  Steve Tew , chief executive officer of
the New Zealand Rugby Union, said in a statement.  In the past, the approval for signing overseas players has
been granted only under exceptional circumstances, such as a
significant lack of depth at a particular position within a
team, the NZRU said.  Safeguards will be put in place to ensure the move doesn’t
hamper the development of local talent, while Pacific island
players won’t be treated as foreigners under the new policy, the
governing body added.  From next year, the southern hemisphere’s elite provincial
rugby tournament will be split into Australian, New Zealand and
South African conferences and feature 31 more games. The
Melbourne Rebels will join the Australian pool as the
competition’s 15th team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
