Canadian stocks  rose to a second-
straight weekly gain after U.S. capital-goods orders rebounded,
boosting commodity prices and shares of financial companies.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third largest
insurer, climbed 3.1 percent as all eight insurance companies in
the main equity index gained. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s
biggest base-metals producer, climbed 3.2 percent as copper
rallied. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s biggest producer, fell
1.6 percent as the metal slipped from a record price.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 103.07
points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,204.86 at 4:16 p.m. in Toronto,
for a 0.3 percent weekly gain.  “The economic data this morning was better than expected
and that’s caused some positive vibes in a fairly thin market,”
said  Greg Taylor , who helps manage about C$4.5 billion ($4.4
billion) at Aurion Capital Management in Toronto. “Canada’s
been buffered by the gold weight and stronger banks. We’re
positive on the market.”  The S&P/TSX has underperformed all except three of 23 other
developed markets’ equity benchmarks this month, due in part to
a 0.9 percent decline in energy stocks. Crude oil futures lost
3.6 percent this year after gaining seven of the previous eight
years.  Orders for products such as computers and communications
gear advanced 4.1 percent in August after slumping 5.3 percent

gains after the metal fell from a record $1,301.60 to $1,298.10.
Goldcorp Inc., the world’s second-biggest producer by market
value, fell declined 0.8 percent to C$44.93. Gold companies make
