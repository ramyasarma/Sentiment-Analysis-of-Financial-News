An investor group led by Pershing
Square Capital Management LP doesn’t have the right to stop a
planned foreclosure of Manhattan’s Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper
Village, lenders to the apartment complex said.  Pershing, led by  William Ackman , and Winthrop Realty Trust
have no right to interfere with the lenders’ foreclosure,
CWCapital Asset Management LLC, the servicer on the $3 billion
senior mortgage on the property, said in documents filed with a
New York state appeals court.  “PSW has no more right to obtain an injunction against the
senior lenders than the Red Sox have to enjoin future free agent
acquisitions by the Yankees,” CWCapital said, referring to the
Pershing-Winthrop venture.  Pershing and Winthrop own $300 million of mezzanine, or
junior, debt on the property. The group this week asked the
appeals court to stay CWCapital’s Oct. 4 foreclosure auction.
Pershing and Winthrop are appealing a lower court ruling
preventing them from conducting their own foreclosure. The
appeals court is scheduled to rule by Sept. 29.  CWCapital said in its court filing that unless the
foreclosure goes forward, the property is on the “threshold of
chaos.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
