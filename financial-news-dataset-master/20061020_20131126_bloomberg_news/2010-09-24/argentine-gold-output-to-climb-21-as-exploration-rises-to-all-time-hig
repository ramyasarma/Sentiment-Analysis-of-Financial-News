Argentina’s gold production will
rise by about 21 percent in 2010 from a year earlier, Mining
Secretary  Jorge Mayoral  said.  Gold output will rise to about 2.05 million ounces this
year from 1.7 million in 2009, Mayoral said yesterday in an
interview in his Buenos Aires office. Exploration and production
are picking up this year following the global economic slowdown
in 2009, he said.  “Drilling recovered after the slowdown in 2009 and there is
an all-time record number of exploration projects in the
nation,” Mayoral said.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. ,  Barrick Gold Corp . and  Xstrata Plc 
are among the miners producing gold in Argentina.  Goldcorp Inc. ,
the second-largest Canadian producer of the precious metal, this
month offered to pay $3.5 billion for Andean Resources Ltd., an
Australian-based gold miner whose primary exploration focused on
the southern Argentine region of Patagonia.  Gold is the metal with best output growth perspectives in
Argentina in the near term, Mayoral said. Silver production will
rise to about 70 million ounces by 2017 from 25 million in 2009
as projects under review now come online, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
