European stocks pared losses after
German business confidence unexpectedly rose to a three-year
high in September.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.2 percent to
260.51 at 9:03 a.m. in London. The gauge, which earlier fell as
much as 0.5 percent, is still on track for a second week of
losses.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
