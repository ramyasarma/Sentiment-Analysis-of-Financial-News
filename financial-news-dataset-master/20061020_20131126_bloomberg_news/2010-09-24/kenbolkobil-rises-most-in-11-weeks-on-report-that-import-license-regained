KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, rose the most in eleven weeks following reports the
company won back a government-issued license to import oil that
had been canceled last month.  The stock surged as much as 9.5 percent, the biggest intra-
day gain since July 8, and was trading at 10.05 shillings at
11:22 a.m. in Nairobi, up 6.4 percent on yesterday’s close.  The government agreed to restore the license after talks
with the company, the Nairobi-based  Business Daily  newspaper
reported today, citing Energy Ministry Permanent Secretary
 Patrick Nyoike .  In July,  Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd.  stopped processing
KenolKobil’s crude oil following a dispute over unpaid fees,
Business Daily said. Last month, Kenya’s  Energy Regulatory
Commission  revoked KenolKobil’s import license on the grounds
the company had violated a rule requiring that 40 percent of
imported fuel products be refined locally, it said. The incident
disrupted fuel supplies in the country, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
