Canada’s budget deficit narrowed in
July because of higher tax revenue and a drop in spending that
reflected fewer jobless benefit payouts and last year’s support
of the automobile industry.  Canada recorded a deficit of C$473 million ($462 million)
in July, down from C$5.82 billion during the same month last
year, according to a statement released today by the finance
department. For the April-July period, the cumulative deficit
narrowed to C$7.7 billion from C$18.3 billion a year ago.  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s government released a
fiscal plan in March that pledged to balance the budget within
five years by controlling spending for defense, international
aid and government operations. Canada had a record deficit that
will surpass C$50 billion in the fiscal year that ended March
31, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said last week.  Total revenue rose 10.5 percent to C$20.4 billion in July,
as corporate tax receipts rose 52 percent and personal income
tax revenue increased 7.6 percent. Revenue rose 5.5 percent in
the four-month period to C$75.1 billion, led by a 34 percent
jump in sales tax revenue, the finance department said.  Program spending fell 16.6 percent in July to C$18.2
billion and 8.6 percent to C$72.6 billion in the April-July
period, reflecting the bailout of carmakers last year that
wasn’t repeated this year. Benefit payments for unemployed
workers fell 10 percent in July to C$1.47 billion. In the April-
July period, they dropped 7.3 percent.  Public debt charges rose 8.5 percent to C$2.67 billion in
July. For the four-month period, they rose 0.7 percent to C$10.2
billion, the report also showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
