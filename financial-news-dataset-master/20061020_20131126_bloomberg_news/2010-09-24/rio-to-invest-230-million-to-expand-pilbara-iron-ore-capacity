Rio Tinto Group , the world’s
second-largest iron ore exporter, will spend $230 million to
expand iron ore export capacity at Dampier Port in Australia to
meet surging demand in Asia.  The work will boost capacity from its mines in the Pilbara
region of Western Australia by 5 million metric tons to 230
million tons a year, Rio said today in a statement. The
expansion, subject to government and other approvals, is
scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2012.  “This investment will demonstrate our ability to bring
incremental capacity on line at very low capital cost and
without disrupting operations or schedules,”  Sam Walsh , the
head of Rio’s iron ore business, said in the statement.  Rio, which aims to boost iron ore output capacity to 330
million tons by 2015, is seeking regulatory approval for an ore
joint venture with  BHP Billiton Ltd.  Iron ore, used to make
steel, was Rio’s biggest earning unit in the first half, driven
by demand from China.  Rio dropped 0.6 percent to A$75.60 at the 4:10 p.m. close
of trade in Sydney on the Australian stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
