CPC Corp. , Taiwan’s state oil
refiner, resumed operations at its No. 5 naphtha cracker in
Kaohsiung yesterday.  The company expects output at the cracker to “return to
normal” today, Vice President  Paul Chen  said in Taipei by
telephone. The plant was shut on Sept. 19 as Typhoon Fanapi
struck the island.  The No. 5 cracker processes naphtha into ethylene, a
material used to make plastics, chemicals and fabrics. CPC
operates three such processing plants with a combined annual
ethylene output capacity of 1.1 million metric tons, including
the No. 5’s 500,000 tons. The first two crackers are no longer
in service.  Typhoon Fanapi swept across Taiwan on Sept. 19, toppling
electric lines, forcing evacuations and closing airports. Two
people were killed, according to the National Fire Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
