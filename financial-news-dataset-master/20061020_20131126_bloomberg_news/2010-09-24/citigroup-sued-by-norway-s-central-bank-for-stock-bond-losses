Norway’s central bank sued
Citigroup Inc. along with Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit 
and Chairman  Richard Parsons  over $835 million in losses in
Citigroup stock and bonds.  Citigroup misrepresented its financial condition and failed
to disclose material information, leading Norges Bank to buy
Citigroup stock and bonds at inflated prices between January
2007 and January 2009, the central bank said in the Sept. 17
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  “Citi’s near-demise had its genesis in the company’s
increasing willingness to take on risk for the sake of profit,
without regard for -- and without disclosing -- the magnitude of
the downside exposure it faced if those risks materialized,”
the bank said in the complaint.  Norges Bank, through its investment arm, is responsible for
investing the assets of Norway’s $459 billion Government Pension
Fund Global, the world’s second-biggest sovereign wealth fund.
The fund posted a record 633 billion kroner ($107.6 billion)
loss in 2008, wiping out gains since the fund started investing
the country’s oil revenue in 1996. The so-called oil fund had a
26 percent return last year.  The central bank’s lawsuit names 20 of Citigroup’s current
and former directors and executives, including former CEO
 Charles “Chuck” Prince .  Vigorous Defense  “We believe the suit has no merit and will defend
ourselves vigorously,” Citigroup spokeswoman  Danielle Romero- Apsilos  said in a statement.  The lawsuit adds to a group of other pending complaints
against Citigroup for losses suffered by investors. The New
York-based bank, today the fourth-largest U.S. bank by deposits,
announced “significant declines” in its $55 billion of
subprime holdings on Nov. 4, 2007, and reported a $9.8 billion
loss for the last quarter of 2007, compared with a $5.1 billion
net profit the previous year. The bank had a net loss of $27.7
billion in 2008 and received a $45 billion bailout from U.S.
taxpayers.  The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Citigroup in a
separate case in July, claiming that the bank, now 18 percent-
owned by U.S. taxpayers, had misled investors by not disclosing
over $40 billion in subprime-related holdings during 2007.
Citigroup agreed to a $75 million fine in a settlement that was
approved by a federal judge today.  Subprime Exposure  Citigroup executives repeatedly stated in conferences calls
in 2007 that the bank had reduced its subprime exposure by 45
percent to $13 billion. The figure omitted “super-senior”
tranches of collateralized debt obligations and financial
guarantees called liquidity puts that added more than $40
billion in subprime exposure, according to the SEC’s complaint.  Gary Crittenden , 57, the bank’s chief financial officer,
agreed to pay $100,000 in a separate settlement with the SEC.
 Arthur Tildesley , former head of Citigroup’s investor relations,
paid $88,000. Crittenden is named as a defendant in Norges
Bank’s lawsuit.  Citigroup’s shares fell 93 percent over the period during
which the Norwegian central bank claimed the bank made its
misleading disclosures, closing at $3.83 on Jan. 15, 2009,
compared with $54.50 two years previously. Citigroup’s 5.85
percent bonds sold in August 2006 and maturing 10 years later
lost 0.8 percent during that period.  Better Served  “Norges Bank’s complaint tracks, in large part, the
complaint filed in the securities class action lawsuit currently
pending against Citigroup, but Norges Bank believes it will be
better served by pursuing its own direct action,”  Bunny Nooryani , a spokeswoman for the central bank in Oslo, said in a
telephone interview. The central bank is also a plaintiff in the
class-action lawsuit, she said.  Nooryani declined to give further details on the amount
sought in compensation or why the bank believes it will be
better served pursuing its own lawsuit.  The case is Norges Bank v. Citigroup, 10-cv-07202, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
