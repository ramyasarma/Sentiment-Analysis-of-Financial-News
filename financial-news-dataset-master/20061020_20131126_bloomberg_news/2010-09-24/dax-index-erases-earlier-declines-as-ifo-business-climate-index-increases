German stocks erased declines as
German business confidence unexpectedly rose to a three-year
high in September. The benchmark DAX Index was little changed at
6,185.18 as of 10:04 a.m. in Frankfurt, after falling as much as
0.5 percent earlier.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8
from 106.7 in August. That’s the highest since June 2007.
Economists had expected a drop to 106.4, according to the median
of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
