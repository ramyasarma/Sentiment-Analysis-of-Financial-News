Japanese government officials
declined to comment on whether Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
administration had intervened in the currency market today after
the yen slid against the dollar in Tokyo trading.  “I won’t comment” on intervention, Finance Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  told reporters in Tokyo. Vice Finance Minister
 Fumihiko Igarashi  earlier said that he hadn’t heard of any
intervention, and a separate government official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, declined to comment to reporters when
asked whether Japan had sold yen.  The yen tumbled 1 percent in about 10 minutes today,
reaching a low of 85.40 per dollar, before trading at 84.81 as
of 2:55 p.m. in Tokyo. The decline was the biggest since Sept.
15, when Japan broke a six-year policy of refraining from
intervention in response to a surge in the currency to the
highest level since 1995.  Nikkei Quick reported that some market sources, whom they
declined to identify, denied that intervention occurred today.
Kyodo News earlier today reported that Japan had likely sold yen
and bought dollars, citing an unidentified market source.  Noda publicly confirmed the Sept. 15 move within minutes of
the start of the yen sales, which are ordered by his ministry
and conducted by the Bank of Japan. Noda earlier today
reiterated the government’s pledge to take “bold” action if
needed.  The Bank of Japan separately said that Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  has no plans to resign, responding to a report citing
speculation that he would step down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
