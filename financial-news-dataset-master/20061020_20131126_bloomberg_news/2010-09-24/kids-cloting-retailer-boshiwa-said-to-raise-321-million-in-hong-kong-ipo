Boshiwa International Holding Ltd. ,
a retailer of children’s clothing, raised HK$2.49 billion

selling stock at the top of the forecast range, said two people
familiar with the sale.  Boshiwa sold 500 million shares at HK$4.98 each, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
was private. The Shanghai-based company initially offered shares
at HK$3.88 to HK$4.98 each, according to its prospectus.  UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and a unit
of Bank of Communications Co. managed the sale, according to the
IPO prospectus.  Boshiwa  plans to start trading on Sept. 29 with the ticker
1698, the prospectus said. The company makes children’s apparel
and other children’s products, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
