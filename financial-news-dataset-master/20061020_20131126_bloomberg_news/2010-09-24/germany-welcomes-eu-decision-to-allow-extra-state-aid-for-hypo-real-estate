The German Finance Ministry
welcomed the European Commission’s decision today to allow the
transfer of about 200 billion euros in toxic assets from state-
owned Hypo Real Estate Holding AG to a so-called bad bank.  “This is a significant step toward the successful
stabilization and restructuring” of the Munich-based bank,
ministry spokesman Michael Offer said in an e-mailed statement.
The ministry also welcomed the Commission’s approval of an extra
capital increase for the lender.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
