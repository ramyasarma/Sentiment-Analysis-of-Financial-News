Research In Motion Ltd.  is poised
to resolve a dispute with the Indian government over whether to
allow monitoring of BlackBerry data, Canadian Trade Minister
 Peter Van Loan  said today.  “We’re pleased that we have been working together -- our
officials with Indian officials -- toward a resolution of the
issue,” Van Loan told reporters today at a press conference
with India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry  Anand Sharma  in
Ottawa. “We believe that RIM can arrive at a resolution.”  RIM last month avoided a ban in the world’s second-largest
mobile-phone market after offering the government a temporary
solution to allow monitoring of BlackBerry data.  India, concerned that terrorists may take advantage of the
encryption in smartphones, has stepped up its scrutiny over the
 telecommunications  industry since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks
that left 166 dead.  Sharma said the issue was discussed. He didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
