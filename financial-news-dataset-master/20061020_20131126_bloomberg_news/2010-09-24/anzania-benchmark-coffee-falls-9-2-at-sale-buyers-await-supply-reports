Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 9.2 percent at an auction yesterday as buyers awaited
reports about global supplies, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The top arabica AA grade sold for an average of $214.28 for
a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $235.98 a week
earlier, the agency said today in an e-mailed report from Moshi,
in northern Tanzania.  Overall prices for washed arabica, known as mild coffee,
fell by an average of $21.15 a bag, while robusta declined by
$1.23 a bag, the board said.  “Buyers were waiting to hear reports about the crop
forecast in Brazil, the leading producer,”  Joseph Njau , the
general manager of the Moshi-based Kilimanjaro Native
Cooperative Union, said by phone. “The market was depressed
because buyers are keen to know the global supply.”  Supplies at the eighth auction of the 2010-11 season fell
24 percent to 24,136 bags, including 1,625 bags carried over
from the previous week, the board said. Sales at the auction
fell 40 percent to 19,010 bags from 31,511 bags, it said.  Tanzania, Africa’s fourth-biggest coffee producer after
Ethiopia, Uganda and Ivory Coast, reaps its crop from April
through August. Arabica accounts for 75 percent of Tanzania’s
output, while robusta accounts for the rest.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
