French pork prices slumped 3.9
percent yesterday, the most in almost two years, after trading
was postponed earlier this week as farmers and slaughterers
failed to agree on a price that would cover rising feed costs.  The price for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pork fell to 1.153
euros ($1.54) from 1.20 euros on Sept. 16, the  Marche du Porc
Breton  in Plerin, France, said on its website. That was the
biggest slide since Oct. 30, 2008,  exchange data  show.  Pigs are normally traded twice a week at France’s only hog
exchange. Trading was postponed on Sept. 20 after it became
clear “quite quickly” there would be no price agreement,
Benoit Monin, the market’s head of sales, said this week.  “In a European context that was strongly downward, the
price quotation on the Marche du Porc Breton was very disrupted
this week,” the exchange said in a statement.  European Union pig producers face a “drastic situation”
because of a “sharp rise” in production costs as well as
costly regulation, farm association  Copa-Cogeca  said in a
statement today, asking the EU to take action.  Plerin pork prices  have slid in the past seven sessions,
the longest streak of declines since October last year. The
price has dropped 7.5 percent from this year’s peak of 1.247
euros a kilogram on Aug. 26.  Feed Expenses  At yesterday’s market, 77,232 pigs for slaughter were
traded, the Marche du Porc Breton said. Pigs are transported
straight from farms to slaughterhouses after the lots are traded
at the exchange.  French pig farmers face higher feed costs after drought
reduced grain production in Russia and Ukraine this year,
pushing up prices. Corn futures have jumped 54 percent this year
on NYSE Liffe in Paris to 208.25 euros ($280.64) a metric ton.  Feed costs have “risen sharply, partly due to speculation
in the international cereals market,” said Pekka Pesonen, Copa-
Cogeca’s secretary general, in a statement. “Pig producers are
consequently facing major difficulties, especially as they have
not had time to recover from the three-year crisis in the EU
pigment sector.”  France is the third-largest EU pig producer, with a hog
population of 14.8 million animals at the end of 2009, behind
Germany and Spain with 26.7 million and 26.3 million pigs
respectively, according to figures from Eurostat, the bloc’s
statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
