Four Japanese held in China for
allegedly videotaping military targets are employees of Fujita
Corp., Kyodo News reported, citing Japan’s foreign ministry.  The employees visited Hebei, China on company business
unrelated to military issues, Yoshiaki Onodera, a spokesman for
the Japanese company, said today by phone in response to an
earlier Xinhua news agency report.  Fujita, a Tokyo-based general contractor acquired by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in April last year, will continue to
gather information through the foreign ministry, Onodera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
