Crude oil in New York may drop as
low as $71.50 a barrel in a short-term consolidation period,
according to technical indicators used by traders to predict
price movements.  Oil for November delivery will fall toward intra-day lows
of $74.25 a barrel reached on Sept. 7 and $73.10 on Aug. 31,
said  Stephanie Aymes , a London-based cross-commodity technical
analyst at Societe Generale SA. The top range of crude’s
consolidation is $76.25, which is close to the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the contract’s drop from its $83.91
high on Aug. 4 to $71.49 on Aug. 25.  “Over the next few sessions crude is due to consolidate
lower,” Aymes said in an interview yesterday. “This is a
range-bound consolidation. This $76.25 is an important level in
the short term but it’s not the resistance of the year.”  The November crude contract has dropped 5.5 percent since
Sept. 14 to an intraday low of $73.58 a barrel yesterday.
Futures fell as much as 0.7 percent to $74.66 today and were at
$75.03 at 11:31 a.m. Singapore time.  New York futures have traded between $70.76 and $78.04 in
the past 30 trading days.  “It’s more like a sideways consolidation then a proper
direction,” Aymes said. “Although there are a bit of more
bearish signals than bullish signals, you can’t call for a very
deep correction at this point.”  The Fibonacci sequence, identified by Italian mathematician
Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century, is used by traders in
financial markets to predict points of support and resistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
