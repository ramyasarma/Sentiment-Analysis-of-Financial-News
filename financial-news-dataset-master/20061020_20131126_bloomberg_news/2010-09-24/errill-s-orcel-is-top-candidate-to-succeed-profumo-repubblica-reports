Andrea Orcel, Bank of America
Corp. Merrill Lynch’s executive chairman of global banking and
markets, is the top candidate to succeed Alessandro Profumo as
UniCredit SpA’s chief executive officer, la Repubblica reported
without saying where it got the information.  Orcel met yesterday in Milan with UniCredit’s Chairman
Dieter Rampl for an “hiring interview,” the Italian daily
said. The banker also met with Deputy Chairman Fabrizio
Palenzona and Fondazione CariVerona Chairman Paolo Biasi,
according to la Repubblica.  Separately MF reported that the bank may prefer an internal
candidate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
