European heavy-truck sales jumped
by 34 percent in August, helped by improving demand from freight
transporters and construction companies in Germany, Spain and
Italy.  Registrations rose to 11,508 trucks weighing 16 metric tons
or more from 8,589 a year earlier, the Brussels-based  European
Automobile Manufacturers’ Association  said in a statement today.
The increase in July was 18 percent.  Gains in the past three months curbed the decline in year-
to-date deliveries to 9.1 percent or 100,787 units, the industry
group said.  Germany, the region’s largest economy, posted a 54 percent
increase to 3,812 units last month. Spain rose 46 percent and
Italy gained 41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
