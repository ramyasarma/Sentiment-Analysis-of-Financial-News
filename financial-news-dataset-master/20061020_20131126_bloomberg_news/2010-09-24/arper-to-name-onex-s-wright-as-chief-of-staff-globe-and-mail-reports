Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  will name a managing director of Onex Corp., the nation’s
biggest buyout firm, as his new chief of staff, the  Globe and
Mail  said, citing Conservative Party President John Walsh.  Nigel Wright  had earlier worked as a policy adviser and
speech writer for former Prime Minister  Brian Mulroney , the
Globe said.  The appointment will help Harper’s government put more
emphasis on the economy, the Globe said, citing Walsh. Andrew
MacDougall, a spokesman for the prime minister, declined to
confirm the appointment when telephoned by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
