U.S. stocks rallied, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to a four-month high, after a
rebound in demand for capital goods and better-than-estimated
earnings at  Nike Inc.  eased concern that the economic recovery
is faltering.  Alcoa Inc ., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, and
 Caterpillar Inc.  helped lead gains among materials producers and
industrial stocks after a government report showed orders for
durable goods excluding transportation equipment rose at twice
the pace forecast by economists. Nike rallied 2.5 percent as
orders surged in China. Hewlett-Packard Co. added 2.1 percent
after an analyst said the world’s largest computer maker may
announce a 2011 earnings forecast that exceeds estimates.  The  S&P 500 Index  surged 2.1 percent to 1,148.67 at 4 p.m.
in New York, the highest since May 13, capping the longest
weekly rally since April and heading for the best September
since 1939. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 197.84
points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,860.26.  “The economy will slowly, slowly get better,” said  Todd M. Morgan , chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC in Los
Angeles, which manages $5 billion. “Stocks are the cheapest
financial assets out there. The amount of cash in individual
hands is enormous, they will get back in.”  September’s Gain  The S&P 500 has climbed 9.5 percent in September as
technology bellwethers announced buybacks,  dividends  and
acquisitions. The benchmark for U.S. equities has declined 5.6
percent from this year’s high in April on concern that American
unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe would derail
global growth.  Stock futures extended gains after  orders  for U.S. capital
equipment rebounded 4.1 percent in August from a 5.3 percent
decline in July, signaling a slowdown in business investment may
be less severe than some economists projected. Durable-goods
orders excluding transportation climbed 2 percent in August, the
Commerce Department said in Washington. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had predicted an increase of 1 percent,
according to the median forecast.  Caterpillar, the world’s  biggest maker  of construction and
mining equipment, advanced 4.6 percent to $79.73 for the biggest
gain in the Dow as industrial stocks jumped 2.8 percent, the
most among 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. Alcoa rallied 3.9
percent to $12.20, helping a gauge of materials producers to a
2.4 percent increase.  The benchmark gauge kept its gains after a report showed
sales of new homes held steady at 288,000 in August, unchanged
from a July figure that was revised higher. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast house sales would rise to 295,000.  ‘Reason to Be Bullish’  “We’ve moved from August’s extreme volatility to a
situation where the market isn’t selling off on the bad news and
rises much more on the good news,” said  Oliver Pursche , co-
manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund and president of Suffern,
New York-based Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which manages
$500 million. “It’s one more reason to be bullish rather than
remain in a defensive stance.”  The S&P 500 should gain an additional 6.6 percent this year
to begin a decade of 8 percent annual returns as concerns of a
return to a recession prove unfounded, BlackRock Inc. Vice
Chairman  Bob Doll  said last night in Toronto.  “The economic recovery is becoming self-sustaining,” said
Doll, whose company oversees $3.4 trillion and is the world’s
largest asset manager. “Given how scared corporations got and
how much they cut costs, that has created an immense opportunity
for earnings.”  German Confidence  European equities climbed as German  business confidence 
unexpectedly rose to a three-year high in September. The Munich-
based Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.8 from 106.7 in
August. Economists had predicted a drop to 106.4, according to
the median of 36 forecasts in Bloomberg News survey.  Nike gained 2.5 percent to $79.57, the highest since the
world’s largest maker of athletic shoes went public in 1980.
Total orders for shoes and clothes for delivery between
September and January grew 10 percent to $7.1 billion, the
company said yesterday. Orders for China surged 25 percent,
outpacing all other regions on demand for basketball-related
sportswear, compared with a 15 percent gain in North America and
declines of 7 percent in Western Europe and 8 percent in Japan.  Hewlett-Packard advanced 2.1 percent to $40.98. The company
will likely provide a 2011 earnings forecast that exceeds the
average estimate of $4.99 a share when it hosts a meeting with
analysts on Sept. 28, according to Barclays Plc.  Oracle, Chipmakers       Oracle Corp.  fell 0.6 percent to $26.96. The world’s
second-largest software maker may buy a chipmaker, Chief
Executive Officer  Larry Ellison  said at the company’s annual
meeting. ARM Holdings Plc, the U.K. designer of chips that power
Apple Inc.’s iPhone, jumped 7.6 percent to $19.79 after
Ellison’s comments.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , the second-
largest maker of microprocessors, added 6.9 percent to $6.84,
while the biggest maker of computer-memory chips, Micron
Technology Inc., rallied 7.9 percent to $7.19 for the second-
largest gain in the S&P 500.  For-profit schools fell, reversing earlier gains, after
U.S. Education Secretary  Arne Duncan  said gainful-employment
legislation will go forward. The department will delay the
release of proposed limits on the colleges’ access to student
grants and loans until early 2011 from Nov. 1, Duncan said.  Education Management Corp.  slid 3.7 percent to $12.23,
 Career Education Corp.  dropped 6.3 percent to $20.38 and
 Corinthian Colleges Inc.  declined 3.1 percent to $6.30.  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  rose 6.8 percent to $11.16 after
the vehicle rental company said its $1.44 billion offer for
Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. is its “best and final”
bid in its takeover fight with Avis Budget Group Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
