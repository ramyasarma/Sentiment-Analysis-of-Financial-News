Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris 
said he’s talking to other potential buyers of stakes in his
telecommunications assets apart from Russian mobile-phone
company  VimpelCom Ltd .  “We’re still in discussions with VimpelCom,” Sawiris
said, while declining to identify the other parties. “The talks
are not finished.”  VimpelCom, which runs Russia’s second-largest cellular
company, has been in talks to merge with some of Sawiris’s
telecoms operators to form a company valued at more than $25
billion, according to two people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
