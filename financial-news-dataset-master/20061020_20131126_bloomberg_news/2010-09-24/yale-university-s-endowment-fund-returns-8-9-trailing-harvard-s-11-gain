Yale University, whose endowment
strategy became a model for schools across the country, said its
investments rose 8.9 percent in the past year, trailing Harvard
University’s 11 percent amid a second straight year of losses on
real estate.  The fund’s value increased 2.5 percent to $16.7 billion in
the year ended June 30, including investment gains of $1.4
billion, $136 million in gifts from donors and $1.1 billion in
distributions to the New Haven, Connecticut, university,
according to a  letter  posted today on its website.  Yale, the second-richest school after Harvard, generated an
average annual return of 8.9 percent in the decade through June,
compared with Harvard’s 7 percent increase and the 3.4 percent
median gain by public and corporate pensions, endowments and
foundations tracked by Wilshire Associates, a consulting firm in
Santa Monica, California. Holdings in real estate, oil and gas,
and timber, which make up 28 percent of the fund, lost 4.5
percent in the past year.  “While real assets provide protection against inflation,
which may prove beneficial in today’s highly uncertain global
economy, in weak economic environments real assets tend to
produce poor returns,” the university said in the statement.  David Swensen , Yale’s chief investment officer, pioneered
an investing style that helped endowments beat market indexes by
relying on assets such as commodities, real estate and private
equity.  Harvard, Penn, Columbia  Private-equity holdings, Yale’s biggest asset class at 33
percent of the fund, returned 18 percent for the year. Yale’s
absolute-return stakes, the endowment’s third-biggest group of
holdings at 19 percent, rose 12 percent. The university’s U.S.
and foreign stocks beat benchmarks, gaining 21 percent and 15
percent.  Harvard’s $27.4 billion fund gained 11 percent last year.
The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia said today its
$5.7 billion fund gained 13 percent, while Columbia University’s
$6.5 billion endowment in New York gained 17 percent. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of stocks rose 12 percent in the
year ended June 30, and fell an average of 1.6 percent a year in
the past decade.  Investments at Yale and Harvard rebounded from record
losses of 25 percent and 27 percent in the year ended June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
