Arsenal Football Club’s property
business generated 156.9 million pounds ($246 million) of
revenue in the year through June, allowing the top-flight
English soccer team to repay all of its real-estate debt.  Built into the former stands of its Highbury Stadium in
north London and bracketing a garden converted from the old
field, the 724-unit Highbury Square development includes
apartments and penthouses. The company sold 362 private homes in
the year through May, up from 208 a year earlier, Arsenal
Holdings Plc said today in a statement.  “The most pleasing aspect of these results is that the
returns generated in the property business during the year,
particularly at Highbury Square,” Chairman  Peter Hill-Wood  said
in the statement. “We now have a debt-free property business
which is accumulating surplus cash as further unit sales are
made at Highbury Square.”  Arsenal, which has won England’s top  league  championship 13
times, played at Highbury from 1913 to 2006 before moving to its
new 60,000-capacity Emirates Stadium nearby. League rules set
for the 1993 season forced teams to convert to all-seated
stadiums, cutting capacity at Highbury to 38,000 from 57,000 and
driving the search for grounds that could generate greater
revenue.  Instead of selling the Highbury site, the team decided to
redevelop the stadium itself and sell apartments. The ground was
first opened as a residential development in September 2009.  Arsenal holds the record for the longest uninterrupted
period in England’s top league, having been there since 1919. In
the final match at Highbury, Arsenal beat Wigan Athletic 4-2,
with club-record goal scorer  Thierry Henry  getting three. Before
moving to Highbury in 1913, Arsenal played in Woolwich, south
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
