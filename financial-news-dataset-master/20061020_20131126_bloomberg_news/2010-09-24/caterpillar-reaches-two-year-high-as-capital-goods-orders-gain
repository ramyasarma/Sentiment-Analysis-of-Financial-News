(Corrects gender of analyst in fifth paragraph in a story
published Sept. 24.)  Caterpillar Inc ., the largest maker
of construction and mining equipment, rose to the highest in
more than two years in New York after U.S. capital-equipment
orders gained more than expected.  Caterpillar , based in Peoria, Illinois, increased $3.47, or
4.6 percent, to $79.73 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares earlier climbed as much as 4.8
percent to $79.93, the highest intraday price since June 23,
2008. Caterpillar dropped 38 percent in  2008  as sales plunged
amid the recession.  Bookings for  capital equipment  excluding defense orders
climbed 4.1 percent in August, the Commerce Department said
today. That beat the median estimate of 72 economists in a
 Bloomberg survey  that forecast a drop of 1 percent.  Credit Suisse AG  analyst   Jamie Cook  today raised targets
for the share price to $95 from $85 and per-share earnings “on
increased sales strength in the U.S. and continued momentum in
emerging markets.”  Caterpillar  will earn $3.95 a share this year, $5.55 in
2011 and $7 in 2012, Cook said in a report. That’s up from her
previous estimates of $3.50 this year, $4.75 next year and $6.25
in 2012, Cook said.  The company in July  forecast  2010 earnings will be $3.15 to
$3.85 a share. The  average estimates  of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg were for per-share profit of $3.73 this year, $5.15
next year and $6.69 in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
