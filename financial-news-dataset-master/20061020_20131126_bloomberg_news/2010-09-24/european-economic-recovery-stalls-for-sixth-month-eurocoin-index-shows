The economic recovery in the euro
region stalled in September for a sixth month as fixed-income
investors became more concerned about the outlook, a  Eurocoin
index  showed.  The monthly index measuring economic expansion in the 16
nations that share the single currency fell to 0.34 percent from
0.37 percent in August, the London-based  Center for Economic
Policy Research  and the Bank of Italy, which co-produce the
index, said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  “This month, modest growth in long-term yields has held
back the indicator,” according to the statement. The index
“has nevertheless been sustained by the favorable trend in
share indexes.”  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production, business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
