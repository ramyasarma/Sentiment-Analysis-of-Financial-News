A U.S. judge questioned whether
 Citigroup Inc. ’s $75 million settlement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission to resolve claims the bank misled
investors by failing to disclose $40 billion in subprime-related
holdings should also include future oversight.  The company made misstatements on earnings calls and in
financial filings about assets tied to subprime loans as the
housing crisis unfolded in 2007, the SEC said July 29 in its
complaint. Some disclosures omitted more than $40 billion in
investments, the SEC said.  U.S. District Judge  Ellen Huvelle  in Washington is hearing
arguments today from SEC and Citigroup attorneys who have been
pushing her for approval, claiming internal policies have been
made to assure these violations couldn’t happen again. Huvelle
suggested the agreement should include language binding
Citigroup to the practices, which might include an independent
auditor to oversee regulatory filings.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Citigroup
Inc., 10-cv-01277, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
