The Bank of Italy sent two letters
to Italian lenders this year asking them to closely scrutinize
transactions involving the Vatican Bank, Corriere della Sera
reported, citing the notes.  The letters, sent in January and on Sept. 9, asked lenders
to inform the Bank of Italy of any failure by the Institute for
Religious Works, or IOR, as the Vatican Bank is called, to
respect “the most basic requirements of money-laundering
rules” in transactions at Italian banks, the  daily  said today.  According to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering
adopted in 2008, Italian lenders must apply stricter standards
to non-European Union banks operating in the country, Corriere
said. The IOR, which is based in sovereign Vatican City, says it
doesn’t operate in Italy while the Bank of Italy claims it does,
the newspaper said.  Italian police this week temporarily seized 23 million
euros ($31 million) from an account at Credito Artigiano SpA
registered to the IOR, as Rome prosecutors probe the IOR’s top
two executives for allegedly omitting information from two wire
transfers in possible violation of money-laundering laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
