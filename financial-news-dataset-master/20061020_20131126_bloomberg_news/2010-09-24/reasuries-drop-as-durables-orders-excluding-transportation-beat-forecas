Treasuries dropped, pushing the 10-
year note yield up for the first time in six days, as a report
showed orders for durable goods excluding transportation items
increased in August more than analysts forecast.  The benchmark 10-year note pared its weekly  advance  as
evidence of an economic recovery discouraged speculation that
the Federal Reserve will boost purchases of U.S. debt. Equities
and crude oil rallied, reducing demand for the relative safety
of government debt.  “The data is a little bit better than people expected
overall,” said Thomas L. di Galoma, head of U.S. rates trading
in New York at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “Bonds have rallied quite a bit over
the last two weeks, so given the stronger data and rising stocks
we are giving some of the gains back.”  The yield on the 10-year note increased 5 basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 4:21 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 fell 15/32, or $4.69
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 5/32.  The 10-year note yield had a weekly drop of 13 basis
points, the biggest decrease since the five days ended Aug. 13,
when it fell 15 basis points. The two-year note yield gained
today 2 basis points to 0.44 percent, compared with the  record
low  of 0.41 percent reached Sept. 22. It fell 2 basis points
this week.  U.S. stocks rose for the first time in four days, pushing
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  up 2.1 percent. Gold advanced to
a record, with futures rising above $1,300 an ounce. Oil for
November delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $75.60 a barrel.  Durable Goods  Bookings for U.S. goods meant to last at least three years
excluding transportation items increased 2 percent last month
after dropping 2.8 percent in July, the Commerce Department
reported today. The median forecast of 48 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 1 percent.  Treasuries briefly pared losses after the Commerce
Department reported that sales of new homes were unchanged at an
annual pace of 288,000 in August, matching the previous month as
the second-lowest in data going back to 1963. The median
forecast of 72 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
advance of 6.9 percent.  The Fed said in its statement on Sept. 21 that it’s
prepared “to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support economic recovery and to return inflation, over time,”
to levels consistent with its mandate.  “This is another indication of the Fed’s desire to push
long rates lower in an effort to stimulate the economy,”  Kevin Giddis , president of fixed-income capital markets in Memphis,
Tennessee, at the brokerage firm Morgan Keegan Inc., wrote in a
note to clients.  Inflation Rate  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17.  The central bank retained its stance from its Aug. 10
meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at about
$2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the financial
system. The  Fed  bought today $3.89 billion of Treasuries
maturing from September 2014 to August 2016, increasing the
amount it has bought since Aug. 17 to $34.062 billion.  The Fed completed in March a program of quantitative easing
to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities
and about $175 billion of agency debt. The central bank was the
biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought $300 billion of U.S.
debt in 2009.  Another round of asset purchases by the Fed may exceed the
amount it bought in 2009, according to Citigroup Inc.  Outlook on Easing  “Should quantitative easing become necessary, we expect
that the sizing will be approximately $100 billion per month in
U.S. Treasuries only, with an initial window of two to three
quarters,”  Brett Rose , a strategist at Citigroup in New York,
wrote in an e-mailed report this week.  The Treasury announced yesterday that it will sell $100
billion in two-, five- and seven-year notes at auction next
week. The government reduced two- and five-year note offerings
by $1 billion to $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively,
while keeping the offering of seven-year securities at $29
billion. The sales amounted to $102 billion the last time the
government sold this combination of securities in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
