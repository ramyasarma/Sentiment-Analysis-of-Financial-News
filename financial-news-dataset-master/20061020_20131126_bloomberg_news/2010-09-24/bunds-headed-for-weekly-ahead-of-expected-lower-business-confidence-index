German government bonds fell for
the first day in four as Portuguese and Irish debt yields
retreated from record highs relative to bunds amid renewed
appetite for securities from the euro area’s periphery.  The declines pared a  weekly advance  after concern flared
this week that political opposition and a slower economic
recovery may dent efforts to rein in the region’s biggest budget
deficits, stoking demand for the safest fixed-income assets. The
Spanish-German yield spread also narrowed after the nation said
it will raise taxes on the highest earners and cut spending.  “We’ve seen some support coming in” for peripheral debt,
said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank AG
in London. “From a fundamental point of view the spread looks
quite attractive” for Ireland, he said.  The bund  yield  rose 5 basis points to 2.33 percent at 4
p.m. in London, paring the weekly drop to 9 basis points. The
2.25 percent bond due in September 2020 fell 0.39, or 3.90 euro
cents per 1,000-euro ($1,347) face amount, to 99.28.  The difference in yield, or  spread , between Portuguese 10-
year bonds and bunds was little changed at 402 basis points
after widening to as much as 420 basis points. The Irish spread
was also little changed, at 417 basis points, after reaching 430
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
