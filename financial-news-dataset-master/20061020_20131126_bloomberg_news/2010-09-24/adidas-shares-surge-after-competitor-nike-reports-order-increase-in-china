Adidas AG , the world’s second-
biggest sporting-goods maker, rose the most in a year in
Frankfurt trading after larger competitor Nike Inc. reported a
25 percent order increase in  China .  The shares advanced 5.4 percent, the most since Sept. 16
last year and the second-biggest gain in Germany’s benchmark  DAX
Index  today. The stock was up 2.36 euros at 45.95 euros as of
the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt.  Adidas Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  said in a
Sept. 20 interview that sales growth resumed in China in the
current quarter and will continue next year. Nike’s order growth
in the country between September and January compared with 15
percent in North America and a 7 percent decline in western
Europe, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said late yesterday.  Nike’s statement is “supporting Adidas’s CEO’s recent
optimistic statements for its Chinese business,”  Thomas Rosenke , an  analyst  at WestLB in Frankfurt, said in a note
today. The analyst said he has put his “reduce” recommendation
on the stock under review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
