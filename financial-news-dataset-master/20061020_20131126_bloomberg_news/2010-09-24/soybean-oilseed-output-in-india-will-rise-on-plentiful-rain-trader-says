India, the biggest buyer of  palm
oil , may produce 13 percent more oilseeds as above-normal rain
in the growing areas lift soybean and peanut yields.  Output may jump to 23.2 million metric tons in the season
starting Nov. 1 from 20.5 million tons this year,  Govindlal G. Patel , managing partner at G.G. Patel & Nikhil Research Co.,
told a conference in Mumbai today. Patel, 71, has been trading
oilseeds for more than four decades.  India may still need to import a record amount of soybean
and palm oils as growing population and incomes drives demand
for fried and processed foods, supporting a rally in prices of
the commodities. Purchases may climb to 9.27 million tons, five
percent more than this year, said Patel.  “While India may produce more oils, rising consumption and
population will lead to more imports,” Dorab Mistry, director
at Godrej International Ltd., told reporters, repeating Patel’s
cooking-fat import forecast. Godrej is one of India’s biggest
buyers of edible oils.  Palm oil has rebounded 18 percent from an eight-month low
on July 7 on speculation that the festival season in Asia will
stoke demand. Soybean oil reached a two-year high in Chicago
yesterday on speculation that China, the biggest buyer of the
oilseed, may increase purchases as freezing weather hurts crops.  December-delivery futures rose 1.1 percent to 2,701 ringgit
($873) a metric ton in Kuala Lumpur, rounding off a fourth week
of gains. November-delivery soybeans added as much as 1 percent
to $11.04 a bushel in Chicago, the highest level since June 2009,
and soybean oil for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to 44.28
cents a pound.  ‘Expensive’  Soybean oil’s  premium  over palm oil widened to $106.33 a
ton yesterday, the most since Aug. 4, Bloomberg data show. The
two commodities are direct substitutes.  “India may import more palm oil next year as soybean oil
becomes more expensive,” said Mistry. “Palm oil has a good
opportunity to capture price-sensitive markets like India.”  India’s vegetable oil demand may increase 4.4 percent to
15.7 million tons next year, Patel said, concurring with  Ashok Sethia , the president of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India, who said Sept. 21 that imports may reach 9.5 million tons.  Palm oil purchases may total 7.2 million tons and soybean
oil 1.5 million tons, Patel said.  India relies on imports to meet half its cooking oil needs
and buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and soybean oil
from Argentina and Brazil. Imports surged 64 percent to a record
1.07 million tons in August from 650,603 tons a year earlier,
the extractors’ association said Sept. 14.  Soybeans, Peanuts  Patel’s production forecast includes 14.1 million tons of
monsoon-planted crops including soybeans and peanuts, and 9.13
million tons of winter harvests. Growers may gather 9.5 million
tons of soybeans, the biggest monsoon oilseed crop, up from 8.2
million tons this year, he said.  The farm ministry yesterday said the monsoon-sown oilseed
production may total 17.27 million tons, including 9.8 million
tons of soybeans. The prediction is more than Patel’s forecast.  Peanut output may jump 21 percent to 5.8 million tons next
year, while production of the oil extracted from the oilseed may
surge 45 percent to 550,000 tons, Patel said. Overall edible oil
output oilseeds may total 6.85 million tons, compared with 6.23
million tons this year, he said.  The monsoon, the main source of irrigation for the nation’s
235 million farmers, has been 104 percent of the 50-year average
this season, exceeding the  weather bureau’s  forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
