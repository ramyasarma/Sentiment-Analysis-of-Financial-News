A Russian Soyuz craft ferrying crew
between the International Space Station and Earth malfunctioned
in space, delaying its return by at least a day, RIA Novosti
reported, citing Anatoly Perminov, head of Russia’s space agency
Roscosmos.  The technical problems are being resolved, Perminov was
cited as saying by the state-run news service. He didn’t
elaborate. The Soyuz, docked at the ISS, is now due to return
three voyagers tomorrow, RIA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
