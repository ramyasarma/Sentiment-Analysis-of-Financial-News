Raw-sugar futures rose to a seven-
month high as dry weather threatens crops in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower. Coffee fell to the lowest price since August,
and cocoa gained.  Brazil’s Center South, the top sugar-growing region, may
produce 560 million metric tons this year, ABN Amro Bank NV and
VM Group said today. That’s less than forecast by Unica, an
industry group. The Amazon River is at its lowest level since
1963 because of drought, the National Water Agency said.  “Dry weather in Brazil is taking its toll,”  James Kirkup ,
the director and the head of the sugar brokerage at ABN Amro,
said in the report.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.78 cent, or 3.3
percent, to settle at 24.4 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the commodity reached 24.47
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
24. This week, the price climbed 4.9 percent, the seventh
straight gain.  In London, refined sugar for December delivery jumped
$14.70, or 2.4 percent, to settle at $633.10 on NYSE Liffe.
Earlier, the price reached $633.70, the highest level since
March 1.  ABN Amro and VM Group lowered their estimate of the global
surplus to 1.2 million tons for the season starting Oct. 1, from
5.64 million forecast in June.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 1.05 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $1.806 a pound in New York. Earlier, the price
touched $1.7825, the lowest level since Aug. 31. This week, the
commodity dropped 4.6 percent, the most since early August.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for November delivery
dropped $10, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $1,727 a ton.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $14, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $2,794 a ton in New York. The price
climbed 1.7 percent this week.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery advanced 4
pounds, or 0.2 percent, to settle at 1,883 pounds ($2,979) a
ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
