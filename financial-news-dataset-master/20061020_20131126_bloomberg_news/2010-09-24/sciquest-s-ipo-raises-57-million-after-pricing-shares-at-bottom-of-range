SciQuest Inc. , the provider of
procurement software to colleges, drugmakers and governments,
surged 29 percent after raising $57 million in the third U.S.
initial public offering of September.  SciQuest climbed  $2.77  to $12.27 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading today. The Cary, North Carolina-based company sold 6
million shares at $9.50 each yesterday after offering them for
as much as $11.50 apiece, a  filing  with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The offering came after Beijing-based  SouFun Holdings Ltd. 
posted this year’s second-biggest first-day rally for a U.S. IPO
on Sept. 17. At least eight more sales are scheduled this month
as more than half the companies that submitted plans for IPOs in
2010 wait to complete them, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The new IPO cycle seems to have started off quite
successfully,” said  Josef Schuster , the Chicago-based founder
of IPOX Capital Management LLC, which oversees $3 billion.
“This should lay a positive groundwork for the IPOs coming up
next week.”  SciQuest , which has more than 165 customers from Yale
University in New Haven, Connecticut, to Roche Holding AG of
Basel, Switzerland, and the State of Georgia, will use proceeds
to redeem preferred stock and for working capital, the filing
said. SciQuest may also use some of the money for acquisitions,
according to the filing.  Relative Value  At the midpoint price of $10.50, SciQuest’s shares would
have been valued at 4.3 times next year’s estimated sales,
according to Independent International Investment Research Plc
in London. That compares with an average of 3.9 times for five
automation software providers from Redmond, Washington-based
 Concur Technologies Inc.  to Ariba Inc. of Sunnyvale, California.  “There is a steeper discount right now that companies have
to take to be active in the new issue market,”  Stephen Wiehe ,
SciQuest’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.
“Frankly, we were very surprised about the very positive and
very energetic reception we had.”  SciQuest was acquired by Trinity Ventures in 2004,
according to Independent International Investment Research. The
Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm owned a 51
percent stake in SciQuest before the sale.  Stifel Financial Corp.  of St. Louis led the offering, while
SciQuest turned to Morris, Manning & Martin LLP in Atlanta for
legal advice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
