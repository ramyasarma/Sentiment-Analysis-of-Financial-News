Olam International Ltd.  is in
initial talks for a possible merger with Louis Dreyfus
Commodities, the world’s largest rice and cotton trader.  The talks are for “a possible business collaboration,
which may take the form of, among others, a merger,” Singapore-
based Olam said today in a statement. “No definitive agreements
in relation to the possible collaboration have been entered
into” and a transaction “may or may not proceed,” it said.  Louis Dreyfus Commodities, a closely held group about 20
percent owned by its employees, has offices in more than 55
countries and had net sales of $34 billion in fiscal 2009,
according to its  website . It may be worth $10 billion to $11
billion, the Financial Times said yesterday, based on estimates
of the ratio of its sales to profit and valuation.  Olam, which said in June it has $1 billion to spend on
acquisitions and investments, had sales of S$10.4 billion ($7.8
billion) last fiscal year. The agricultural commodities trader,
partly owned by Temasek Holdings Pte, is expanding into
production and farming to augment its trading activities. Olam
last year received a S$437.5 million equity investment from
Temasek, the Singapore state-owned investment company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
