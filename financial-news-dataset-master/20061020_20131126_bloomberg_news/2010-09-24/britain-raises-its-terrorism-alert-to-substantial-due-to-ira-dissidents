The threat level from Irish
terrorists to the U.K. has been raised from “moderate” to
“substantial,” said Britain’s Home Secretary,  Theresa May .  May said an attack is a “strong possibility” and the
information was released to encourage people to remain vigilant.
May made the statement today after receiving information from
the director-general of Britain’s security service.  “This is the first time we have published the Irish-
related threat assessment to Great Britain,” May said in the
statement. “This is in the interest of transparency.”  In a speech on Sept. 15, the director general of the U.K.’s
domestic intelligence agency MI5, Jonathan Evans, drew attention
to the threat from dissident Republican groups.  To contact the reporters on this story:
