Corn rose the most in almost three
months and soybeans jumped to a 15-month high as flooding
threatened to damage fields in Minnesota, the fourth-largest
grower of the crops.  More than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell since
yesterday in southern Minnesota, where the soil was already
saturated, according to  T-Storm Weather LLC  in Chicago. As much
as 40 percent of the state’s crops may suffer reduced yields,
according to  Bob Zelenka , the executive director of the
 Minnesota Feed and Grain Association  in St. Paul.  “There could be yield losses, especially for soybeans,”
said  Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for the Professional
Farmers of America newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “We are
trying to find a price high enough to slow demand,” after dry
weather reduced grain and oilseed production in eastern Europe
and Russia, Grete said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 22.5 cents, or 4.5
percent, to close $5.2175 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since June 30, when the
government said farmers planted less than they had planned.  Corn gained 1.7 percent this week, the fourth straight
weekly gain. On Sept. 20, the commodity reached $5.2375, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 30, 2008.  Soybeans Advance  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 32.5 cents,
or 3 percent, to $11.26 a bushel on the CBOT. Earlier, the
commodity reached $11.2825, the highest price since June 2009.
The oilseed, used to make animal feed and cooking oil, rose 5.3
percent this week, the biggest gain in 10 months.  Corn rose to a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008, and
soybeans reached an all-time high of $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Speculative buying also increased after the dollar dropped
to the lowest level since February against a basket of six major
currencies, gold rose to a record and crude-oil prices rose the
most in two weeks, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  The Federal Reserve said this week it may take more steps
to bolster the U.S. economy. The  Continuous Commodity Index  of
17 raw materials rose to a 25-month high today.  “In a zero percent interest-rate environment, the investor
community is focused on commodities with a declining supply
situation,” Roose said. “It’s becoming an ‘agflation’ story.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
