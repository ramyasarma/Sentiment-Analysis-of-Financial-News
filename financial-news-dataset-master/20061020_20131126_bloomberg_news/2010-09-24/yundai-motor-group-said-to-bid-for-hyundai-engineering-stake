Hyundai Motor Group, the owner of
South Korea’s largest automaker, plans to bid for  Hyundai
Engineering & Construction Co. , joining the competition for a
$2.4 billion stake in the country’s largest builder.  The group, which includes  Hyundai Motor Co.  and  Kia Motors
Corp. , will probably announce the plan on Sept. 27 before
submitting a preliminary bid by Oct. 1, two people with
knowledge of the plan said by phone today, confirming a report
by Yonhap News. The people declined to be identified as the
plans are private.  Seoul-based Hyundai Engineering’s creditors, including
Korea Exchange Bank, will accept final bids for their combined
35 percent stake in the builder and will hold preliminary
bidding by Oct. 1, sale arrangers Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch & Co., Woori Investment & Securities Co. and Korea
Development Co. said in a public notice in South Korean
newspapers yesterday.  Hyundai Motor and its affiliates severed ties with the
former Hyundai Group in 2000 as part of the group’s plan to
split into three operations, each to be managed by one of
founder Chung Ju Yung’s three sons. Creditors took control of
debt-ridden Hyundai Engineering in 2001.  Hyundai Group affiliates Hyundai Merchant Marine Co.,
Hyundai Elevator Co. and Hyundai Securities Co. said in August
they will bid for Hyundai Engineering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
