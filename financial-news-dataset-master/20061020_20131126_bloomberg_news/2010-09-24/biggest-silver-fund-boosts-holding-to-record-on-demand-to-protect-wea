Silver holdings in the  iShares
Silver Trust , the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by the
precious metal, rose to a record, according to figures on the
company’s  website .  Assets  held by the fund jumped 73.04 metric tons to
9,582.59 tons yesterday, the highest since the fund was launched
in April 2006. Silver holdings in the fund have expanded 9.8
percent in the past year as the metal doubles as a store of
value for investors concerned that the recovery may falter,
hurting currencies, and as a raw material for industry.  “Silver flirted with 30-year peaks as the threat of
currency devaluation lifted interest in the metal as a safe
store of value,” Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. traders led
by  Alex Heath , wrote in an e-mail yesterday.  Silver for immediate delivery surged to $21.2475 an ounce
yesterday, the highest price since March 2008, and just 0.5
percent short of the peak of $21.355 an ounce 30 months ago. The
metal was little changed at $21.1450 an ounce at 9:14 a.m. in
Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
