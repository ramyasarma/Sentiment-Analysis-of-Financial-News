When summer turns to fall I usually
bemoan the arrival of shorter days and worry about the lack of
sunlight that follows in my part of the world.  There is a silver lining though: The  sunset  is fast
approaching the cocktail hour.  For the next month, the sun will set between 6 and 7 in New
York and that’s a perfect hour to get situated with a good view
and still get home in time for dinner.  Sunsets from bars in the Meatpacking District or from the
World Financial Center’s western plazas are fantastic. Many
rooftop bars don’t offer clear views of sunsets, though, because
of buildings in the way.  If you still don’t have access to a private terrace facing
west and a frozen bottle of  Stolichnaya , here are my suggestions
for the drinking people of Manhattan.  Gigino at Wagner Park at the southern tip of the island
offers unparalleled views of sunsets, the Statue of Liberty and
lots of activity in the harbor.  The tight, outside seating area is reserved for diners,
though I’ve never had trouble lingering over a drink and a small
bite. Last week, I watched sailing-school students and sipped a
$9 glass of Prosecco. Your experience is going to depend on the
day and the number of reservations.  Gigino is at 20 Battery Place, a short walk from the
Bowling Green subway station. Information: +1-212-528-2228 or

Intrepid Museum and near where pilot Chesley “Sully”
Sullenberger smoothly ditched US Airways flight 1549 in January
2009. Relive the moment with your own Miracle on the Hudson:
Grey Goose vodka poured over crushed ice with a twist of lemon
for $10.  The outdoor bar and restaurant area has comfortable silver-
mesh bar stools and patio furniture from which you can watch the
huge Circle Line sightseeing boats negotiate parking spaces in
the Hudson. I saw children frolicking in a fountain, dogs
canoodling in a dog run and the bartender using a marble mortar
and pestle to prepare a mojito, all while I watched the sun set.  P.D. O’Hurley’s outdoor seating area is open until about 8
daily to mid-October, maybe later if the weather permits. It’s
located at 557 12th Ave., at 44th Street. Information: +1-212-
643-6233 or  http://www.pdohurleys.com .  Pier and Basin  The southern end of Riverside Park, on the West Side,
offers two choices for sunset drinks, Pier I Cafe at 70th Street
and Boat Basin Cafe at 79th.  The drink selection is better at the Basin with its full
bar and frozen-drink machines. Head for the terrace so you can
see the bobbing boats in the setting sun. At the Pier, all the
tables are outdoors where you can also enjoy the little dramas
unfolding as parks-service people try to ticket cyclists for not
dismounting when the signs are everywhere.  Pier I Cafe information: +1-212-362-4450 or
 http://www.piericafe.com . Boat Basin information: +1-212-496-
5542 or  http://www.boatbasincafe.com .  Amid the car dealerships on 11th Avenue is the Ink48 Hotel,
where the 16th-floor  Press Lounge  has one heck of a view of the
sunset from the outdoor, wrap-around terrace. The bar menu,
served until 10, consists of a farmstead cheese plate for $18
and a selection of salumi and olives for $14. A friend and I sat
inside at the bar with $12 Stoli and sodas chatting about  Oracle
OpenWorld  with brokerage-house suits.  Press Lounge is located at 653 11th Ave. at 48th Street.
Information: +1-212-757-2224 or  http://www.ink48.com .  Happy Hour  The newly opened  Sky Room , claiming to be the highest
rooftop bar in Manhattan, occupies the 33rd and 34th floors of
the Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott. While the sunset view is
impaired by a nearby building, the reason to go is happy hour.  Weekdays from 4 to 7 bottled beer is $5, well drinks and
wine by the glass are $7. Food specials include $5 calamari and
$8 pizzas. Themed drinking nights like Grey Goose Monday and
Bacardi Friday offer drink specials from $7.  Sky Room is at 330 W. 40th St. Information: +1-212-380-1195
or  http://skyroomnyc.com .  Doing the Math  High above Times Square on the 48th floor of the Marriott
Marquis Hotel sits the only revolving restaurant in New York
City. The View Lounge turns clockwise a full 360 degrees every
58 minutes, which is 6.2 degrees per minute.  Use this handy formula to ensure you are looking west when
the sun sets:  Time of Sunset  minus Time of Arrival times 6.2
equals Degrees from the West to Sit.  Or, arrive an hour before sunset, sit on the west side and
enjoy a couple of $19 Stoli martinis while you slowly rotate to
your view. The cocktail napkin, which names the surrounding
buildings, will keep you busy.  The View Lounge is at 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th
streets. Information: +1-212-704-8900 or
