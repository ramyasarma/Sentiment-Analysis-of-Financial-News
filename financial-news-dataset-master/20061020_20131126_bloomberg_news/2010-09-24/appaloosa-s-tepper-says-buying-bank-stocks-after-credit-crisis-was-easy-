David Tepper , head of hedge-fund
firm Appaloosa Management LP, said he bought bank stocks in 2009
because the U.S. government published its plan to prop up the
financial sector after the credit crisis.  “It was easy,” Tepper, 53, said in an interview on CNBC
television today. “The government told you what they were going
to do.”  Appaloosa, based in Short Hills, New Jersey, bought shares
in  Bank of America Corp. ,  Wells Fargo & Co.  and  Citigroup Inc. 
in 2009 after the U.S. pumped money into the ailing banking
sector. His firm had a 132 percent return in 2009, while the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index  of 80 companies rose
137 percent from a 27-year low on March 6, 2009.  Tepper said financial stocks are about 10 percent of the
holdings of his firm, which oversees $12.4 billion. He earned an
estimated $4 billion in 2009, making him the highest-paid hedge-
fund manager, according to a report published in April by AR
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
