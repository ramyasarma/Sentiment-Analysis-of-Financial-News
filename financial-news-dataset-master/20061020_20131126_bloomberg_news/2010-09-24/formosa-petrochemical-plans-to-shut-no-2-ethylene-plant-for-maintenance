Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ,
Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner, said it plans to shut
its No. 2 ethylene plant on Oct. 5 for scheduled maintenance.  The stoppage at the refiner’s second-biggest ethylene plant
will last 40 to 45 days,  Lin Keh-yen , a company spokesman, said
by telephone in Taipei today. Repairs at its smaller No. 1
ethylene plant, closed July 7 after a fire, have been “delayed
slightly” by rains, Lin said.  Formosa Petrochemical  has three naphtha-processing  plants 
with a combined annual capacity of 2.935 million metric tons of
ethylene, a raw material for plastics, chemicals and synthetic
fibers. The No. 2 plant is able to produce 1.035 million tons of
ethylene a year and the No. 1 unit 700,000 tons.  The refiner now expects to complete repairs at the No. 1
plant in early October after failing to finish the job in late
September because of bad weather, Lin said. Formosa
Petrochemical probably won’t buy any naphtha for delivery in
October because of the delay, according to Lin.  Formosa Petrochemical “doesn’t have a time table” for
resuming production at No. 1 because the refiner needs to get
government approval for starting it after the accident, he said.  The  shares  climbed 0.6 percent to close at NT$79 in Taipei
trading as of 1:30 p.m. local time. The benchmark Taiex index
declined 0.4 percent.  Typhoon Fanapi swept across Taiwan on Sept. 19, bringing
heavy rains, forcing evacuations and closing airports. Two
people were killed, according to the National Fire Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
