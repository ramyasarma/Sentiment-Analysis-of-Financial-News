The Canadian dollar is likely to
strengthen to a record $1.15 versus the greenback by the end of
next year, said  Patricia Croft , chief economist of RBC Global
Asset Management.  The currency will gain “due to tighter monetary policy in
Canada, a fundamentally better fiscal position, stronger
commodity prices and a weaker U.S. dollar,” Croft said
yesterday at a dinner for the Toronto CFA Society.  Canada’s dollar will trade at 97 U.S. cents at the end of
2011, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The Canadian currency bought 96.82 U.S. cents as
of 12:06 p.m. in Tokyo. It climbed to a record $1.104 in
November 2007.  The Bank of Canada raised its  interest rate  to 1 percent on
Sept. 8, the third increase this year. The Federal Reserve has
kept its benchmark on hold in a range of zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
