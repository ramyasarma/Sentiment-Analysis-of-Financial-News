Jason Atherton , the British chef
who created Maze restaurants for  Gordon Ramsay , is to cook for
two nights only at a pop-up eatery off London’s Oxford Street.  The venue, at a makeshift site on Binney Street, will
accommodate 40 guests for dinner on Oct. 4 and 5. Tickets,
costing 150 pounds ($235), include Champagne and other wines.
Proceeds will go to the  StreetSmart  charity for the homeless.  “I came to London at the age of 16 and I’ve been lucky
enough to work my way through some of the most famous
kitchens,” Atherton, 38, said today in a telephone interview.
“It’s great to be able to give something back through the joy
of cooking. StreetSmart is a charity I support dearly.”  Atherton, who split from his mentor earlier this year, will
serve dishes -- such as Orkney langoustine, lemon-peel puree,
oyster leaf and brandy-head dressing -- that are likely to make
it onto the menu of his establishment, Pollen Street Social,
which is scheduled to open in late January. He will be backed by
members of the team he built up at Maze.  The project is backed by the Grosvenor Estate, Restaurant
Associates,  Enotria  wine and the  London Restaurant Festival .
Tickets may be purchased by calling +44-20-7280-0700.  StreetSmart is popular with chefs. Ramsay will be cooking
on board the London Eye for the charity on Oct. 8.  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
