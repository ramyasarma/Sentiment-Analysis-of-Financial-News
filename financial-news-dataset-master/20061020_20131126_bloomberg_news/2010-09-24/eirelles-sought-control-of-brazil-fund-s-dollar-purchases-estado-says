Brazilian central bank President
Henrique Meirelles requested that the bank run dollar purchases
through the country’s sovereign wealth fund, O Estado de S.
Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  Meirelles wanted policy makers to be in control of buying
dollars through the fund to avoid “excess noise” in the
currency market if the fund acted alone, the newspaper said.  The government authorized the fund to buy an unlimited
amount of dollars with reais as part of efforts to stem the
real’s appreciation, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
