Dutch companies will soon face a
shortage of workers as the labor market tightens,  Randstad
Holding NV  Chief Executive Officer  Ben Noteboom  said.  “We will soon see shortages again” in the labor market,
he said today at a symposium celebrating the staffing company’s
50th anniversary at its headquarters in the Dutch town of
Diemen.  The  unemployment rate  in the Netherlands, adjusted for
seasonal swings, fell to 5.3 percent in August from 5.5 percent
in the previous month, the national statistics bureau CBS in The
Hague said on Sept. 16.  The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis or  CPB 
this week lowered its forecast for next year’s unemployment rate
to 5.5 percent compared with a June projection of 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
