Palm oil advanced in Malaysia and
is poised for a fourth week of gains on expectation that demand
from the biggest users will rise, and as rival soybeans climbed.  December-delivery futures rose as much as 0.8 percent to
2,692 ringgit ($869) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,687 ringgit.  “There’s expectation that demand from India and China will
rise on higher economic growth,” said  Harish Galipelli , vice
president at JRG Wealth Management Ltd., which advises traders.
“Firm soybeans are also supporting palm oil.”  India, the top buyer of vegetable oils after China, may
import a record 9.5 million tons in the year starting Nov. 1,
from 9 million tons,  Ashok Sethia , president of the Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India, said in an interview.  Purchases surged 64 percent to a record 1.07 million tons
in August from 650,603 tons a year earlier, the group said.  Soybeans rose yesterday, approaching a 15-month high, after
government reports showed increasing demand for supplies from
the U.S., the biggest producer and exporter. U.S. shippers sold
120,000 metric tons to China, the Department of Agriculture said
yesterday, bringing this week’s total to 741,000 tons.  Futures for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to close at
$10.935 a bushel in Chicago. On Sept. 20, the oilseed climbed to
$10.995, the highest level since June 2009.  CME Group Inc.’s December-delivery palm oil contract, which
is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark, fell 0.1 percent to $866.5
a ton in Singapore.  The Dalian Commodity Exchange was closed for holidays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
