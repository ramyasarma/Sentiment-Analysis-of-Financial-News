The Munich offices of investor
advocacy group  Schutzgemeinschaft der Kapitalanleger e.V.  were
searched for the second time in a market-manipulation probe that
has widened to 31 suspects.  Munich prosecutors raided 48 homes and offices in Germany
and Austria on Sept. 21, prosecutor spokeswoman  Barbara Stockinger  said in an interview today. The probe is focused on
whether investors manipulated share prices.  Munich prosecutors have been investigating SdK since 2008,
when the offices were initially raided, the group’s spokesman
Lars Labryga said in an interview. The probe has now widened to
a larger group of suspects, said Labryga.  “The suspects may have tried to push the price of penny
stocks by making public announcements,” said Stockinger. “In
other cases, they tried to manipulate shares with negative news
while not disclosing they held the stock themselves.”  Stockinger declined to identify any suspects or the names
of people or organizations searched.  SdK’s former Vice Chairman  Markus Straub  stepped down in
2008 after investing in short positions in  Wirecard AG , a German
seller of online-payment software. Short sellers profit by
selling borrowed stock from shareholders on the expectation that
the price will fall and they can repurchase the securities at a
lower price, return them to the owner and pocket the difference.  Straub didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
