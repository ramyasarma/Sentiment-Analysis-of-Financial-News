Silvio Berlusconi’s Fininvest SpA
may pay reduced damages to Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA as
part of a legal case involving the 1991 takeover battle for
publisher Arnoldo Mondadori SpA, news agency MF-Dow Jones
reported, citing a Milan court-ordered evaluation. The final sum
may be reduced by as much as 24 percent from the original
damages of 750 million euros, according to the report. CIR
declined to comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
