Borders Group Inc.  scrapped plans
to go ahead with a store opening on Manhattan’s Upper West Side,
a few weeks after  Barnes & Noble Inc . said it would close an
outlet in the neighborhood.  Borders, the second-largest U.S. book chain, has suspended
store openings as it shuts underperforming locations in a bid to
turn a profit after four straight annual losses. The Manhattan
location and one opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, in June were
holdouts from when the company was expanding, former Chief
Financial Officer  Mark Bierley  said in an interview in April.  “It strategically did not fit with our current priorities,
one of which is to focus on our current store base,”  Mary Davis , a spokeswoman for Borders, said today in an e-mail.  Both chains reported losses in their most recent quarters,
as they respond to consumers’ increasing appetite for digital
books and for buying books over the Internet. Barnes & Noble has
spent millions developing its own digital-book reader, the Nook.
Borders plans to sell more non-book items in its stores.  Barnes & Noble, based in New York, said Aug. 31 it will
close a superstore on the Upper West Side when the lease ends in
January. That will leave the largest U.S. bookstore chain with
seven outlets remaining in Manhattan.  Borders operates five locations in the borough. The
canceled store was set to open in 2011, Davis said.  Borders , based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rose 1 cent to $1.27
at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Barnes & Noble climbed 5 cents to $17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
