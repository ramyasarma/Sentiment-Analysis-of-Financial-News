SEB AB, the second-largest bank in
the Baltic countries, had its individual rating raised one step
to B, the third-highest, from B/C at Fitch Ratings, after Baltic
asset quality improved and it secured long-term funding.  Fitch reiterated SEB’s A+ long-term issuer default rating,
with a stable outlook, it said in a statement late yesterday.   “The upgrade reflects Fitch’s view that SEB has
successfully addressed the deteriorating asset quality in the
Baltics,” Fitch said in the statement. “It also takes into
account Fitch’s expectation of growth in SEB’s key markets and
lower credit charges in the Nordic region than previously
expected. The upgrade also factors in the bank’s success in
securing ample long-term capital market funding.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
