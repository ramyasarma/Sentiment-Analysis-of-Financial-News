During the Korean War, Pfc. James
Ransome’s unit was accidentally hit by American napalm. Burned
skin rolled off the men like “fried potato chips,” and in
unbearable agony, the soldiers begged to be shot.  The use of napalm during the Vietnam War became the target
of protests in the U.S., but the American military loved the
“infernal jelly.” Oceans of it were dropped on North Korean
civilians, whose bodies became “covered with a hard, black
crust sprinkled with yellow pus.”  According to Bruce Cumings, Gen. Matthew Ridgway wanted
bigger napalm bombs to “wipe out all life in tactical
locality,” and by the end of American involvement, the U.S. had
dropped nearly 33,000 tons of napalm and 635,000 tons of bombs
on North Korea, more than in the entire Pacific Theater during
World War II.  Before the armistice in 1953, an estimated two million
people died in North Korea, with the majority of their towns and
cities destroyed.  I spoke with Cumings, author of “ The Korean War ,” on the
following topics:  1. Japanese Colonialism  2. U.S. Phase 1: War for South  3. Phase 2: Rollback  4. Phase 3: Trench Warfare  5. Napalm Incendiary Bombing  To listen to the podcast, click  here . To buy this book in
