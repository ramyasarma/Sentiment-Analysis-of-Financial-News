Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of
“The Black Swan,” said he’s concerned about prospects for the
U.S. economy because government debt in the country is higher
than in other industrialized countries.  “I am extremely bearish on the U.S.,” Taleb said in a
Canadian television interview from Montreal today. “We have an
administration that, unlike the European administrations, is not
aware of the risks of mounting deficits, of the addiction to
public deficits and to big government.”  Taleb wrote the 2007 best-seller “The Black Swan: The
Impact of the Highly Improbable,” which argues that history is
littered with rare, high-impact events that can roil markets.
The black-swan theory stems from the ancient misconception that
all swans were white.  To contact the reporter for this story:
