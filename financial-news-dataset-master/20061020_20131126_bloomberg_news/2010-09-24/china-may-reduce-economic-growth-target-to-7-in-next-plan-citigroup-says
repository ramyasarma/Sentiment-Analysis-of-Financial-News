China may pare its economic growth
target to 7 percent in the nation’s next five-year plan starting
in 2011, Citigroup Inc. said in an e-mailed note today.  Citigroup said the target in the previous plan was 7.5
percent. The government will want “to signal its willingness to
slow the growth rates in exchange for a better quality of
growth,” the note said. “A lower growth target would signal
the beginning of structural reforms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
