Bank of England policy maker Andrew
Sentance said U.K. interest rate should be raised soon and the
increases should be gradual, according to an interview with the
Grantham Journal.  “We should be thinking to increase interest rates quite
soon but in a way that is gradual so it doesn’t disturb business
and consumer confidence,” he told the paper.  “The economy is now on a recovery track and inflation is
above target and if we don’t start adjusting monetary policy we
may have to do it more dramatically down the line and that might
be a big shock to confidence,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
