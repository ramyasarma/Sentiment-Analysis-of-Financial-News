China has something the U.S. lacks,
an airline stock that investors can buy and hold, according to
 Kenneth Fisher , the billionaire chairman of Fisher Investments
Inc. and columnist for Forbes magazine.  China Southern Airlines Co. , the nation’s largest carrier,
is a stock that investors can retain for “5 to 10 years,”
Fisher, 59, said in an interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . The company is “a functional
representation of China’s basic need to engage in global trade
to grow,” said Fisher, who oversees $35 billion from Woodside,
California. “You can’t really do that in this day and age
without a global airline.”  China Southern  rallied today to $28.39, the highest since
March 2008. The American depositary receipts peaked at $66.47 in
September 2007 and fell as low as $5.50 in October 2008.  The company expects passenger traffic next year to grow
more than 10 percent, Chairman  Si Xian Min  said Sept. 14.  “Once upon a time in developed markets, airlines were 5-
and 10-year buy-and-holds, but it was a long time ago when those
developed markets were still emerging,” Fisher said. “Today
airlines are a hot growth category in emerging markets. In
developed markets they’re as doggy as can be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
