The Netherlands, the fifth-largest
economy in the euro zone, lowered its funding need for this and
next year as it expects budget deficits to narrow.  The Netherlands plans to borrow 117.9 billion euros ($158
billion) next year, the Dutch State Treasury Agency said in its
quarterly  outlook  published on its website today.  The Dutch government lowered this year’s money-market
funding need to 66.9 billion euros, matching its initial
December forecast, from an earlier projection of 70.2 billion
euros. Full-year borrowing will decline to 118.9 billion euros
from an earlier estimate of 122.2 billion euros.  The Netherlands expects to narrow next year’s budget
shortfall to 4 percent of gross domestic product from a June
forecast of 4.7 percent, the government said in its 2011 budget
presented earlier this week. This year’s deficit will be 5.8
percent of GDP, exceeding the European Union’s 3 percent ceiling
for the second consecutive year.  Germany, the largest Dutch trading partner, trimmed the
amount of government debt it plans to sell in the fourth quarter
after “favorable developments” in the federal budget reduced
the need to borrow. Germany will sell 60 billion euros of bonds
and bills in the fourth quarter, 29 billion euros less than
forecast in December, the Federal Finance Agency said Sept. 23.  The Dutch Finance Ministry’s agency will publish details of
next year’s funding need in its Outlook 2011 on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
