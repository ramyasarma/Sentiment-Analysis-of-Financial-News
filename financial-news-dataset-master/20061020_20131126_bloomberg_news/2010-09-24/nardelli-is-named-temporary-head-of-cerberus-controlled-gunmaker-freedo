Robert Nardelli , former chief
executive officer of Chrysler LLC and  Home Depot Inc ., was named
the temporary head of Freedom Group Inc. while the gunmaker
looks for a permanent CEO, according to a statement today.  Nardelli runs a unit of Cerberus Capital Management LP, a
New York-based buyout firm that controls Freedom, whose best-
known brand is Remington firearms.  Theodore Torbeck  resigned
earlier this month as CEO of the Madison, North Carolina-based
company, which filed for an initial public offering last year.  Nardelli, 62, was ousted as head of Atlanta-based Home
Depot in 2007 amid criticism of his pay and the company’s
lagging performance. He ran Chrysler for Cerberus until 2009
when the carmaker filed for bankruptcy after one of the worst
sales slumps in decades.  Private-equity firms pool investor money to take over
companies, financing the purchases mostly with debt, with the
intention of selling them later for a profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
