A mini-replica of the ill-fated
ocean liner Lusitania and handmade medieval knights on horseback
are among the antique toys that Forbes Media LLC is selling at a
 Sotheby’s  auction in New York on Dec. 17.  Forbes, which auctioned part of its famous toy collection
in 1994, is selling the rest of its miniature soldiers, boats
and motorcycles, as well as an early version of the Monopoly
board game.  The company that publishes Forbes magazine has cut staff in
recent years because of a decline in advertising, and it sold
its Greenwich Village headquarters to New York University in
January.  The toy sale is estimated to raise between $3 million and
$5 million. The collection, acquired over four decades by the
late Malcolm Forbes and his sons, has been a fixture at the
Forbes Galleries in New York for the past quarter-century.  “My brothers and I concluded it was best that others now
have a chance to own them, collect them and maybe even wind them
up in a pond or pool and watch them go,” company vice president
Robert Forbes said in a statement provided by Sotheby’s.  Four years after Malcolm Forbes’s death in 1990, the family
auctioned part of the toy collection at Sotheby’s for $393,000.
Forbes’s collection of Faberge Imperial Easter eggs was sold to
Russian tycoon Viktor Vekselberg for an undisclosed price in
2004.  Toy Battleship  The replica of the Lusitania, which was sunk by a German
submarine in 1915, includes five pairs of lifeboats and two
seaman. Bought for $28,600 by Forbes in 1983, it is projected to
fetch as much as $200,000 at the auction.  A 47-inch-long replica of a 19th-century battleship known
as “Andre the Giant” is estimated to sell for as much as
$300,000. The auction also includes two sets of horse-mounted
knights, handmade in Britain by Richard Courtenay. The largest
set, which includes 27 3-inch-tall figures (some brandishing
javelins), carries a top estimated price of $25,000.  A 1930s version of Monopoly made by Charles Darrow, who
sold the rights to Parker Bros. in 1935, is projected to sell
for as much as $80,000.  Malcolm Forbes, the magazine’s longtime publisher, was an
adventurer who rode motorcycles and piloted hot-air balloons. He
also was an avid collector whose 1989 memoir was titled, “More
Than I Dreamed: A Lifetime of Collecting.”  “Collecting is a bug easily caught and rarely cured,” he
wrote.  At one point Forbes owned more than 70,000 toy soldiers,
installed in a private museum in his Moroccan palace.  To contact the reporter on the story:
