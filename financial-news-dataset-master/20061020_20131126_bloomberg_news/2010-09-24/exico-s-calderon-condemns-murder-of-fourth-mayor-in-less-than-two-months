Mexican President Felipe Calderon
“energetically condemned” the murder late yesterday of
Prisciliano Rodriguez, mayor of the northern town of Doctor
Gonzalez, the fourth such killing in less than two months.  Gunmen killed Rodriguez and local government aide Eliseo
Lopez on a highway in Nuevo Leon state, according to the  website 
of the state attorney general’s office. The attorney general
didn’t provide details of the shooting.  Calderon said in a statement he will continue working for
the security of Mexico’s citizens.  On Sept. 9, Alexander Lopez, mayor of El Naranjo in San
Luis Potosi state, was killed as he sat at his desk. Gunmen
kidnapped and then murdered Edelmiro Cavazos, the mayor of
Santiago in Nuevo Leon on Aug. 15, and  Marco Antonio Leal , the
mayor of Hidalgo in the border state of Tamaulipas, was shot
dead while driving on Aug. 29. A gubernatorial candidate was
killed in Tamaulipas in June.  Politicians are increasingly becoming victims of drug-
related violence, which has killed more than 28,000 people since
Calderon took office in December 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
