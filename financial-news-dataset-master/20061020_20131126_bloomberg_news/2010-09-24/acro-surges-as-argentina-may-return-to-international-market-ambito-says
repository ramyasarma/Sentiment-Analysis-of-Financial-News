Banco Macro SA , Argentina’s largest
lender by market value, rose the most in more than four months,
leading gains by banks, on news that bankers had offered the
government terms that would allow it to return to international
bond markets.  Banco Macro rose 8.2 percent to a record 18.50 pesos at
3:59 p.m. New York time, the steepest increase since May 10,
while the  Merval index  gained 2.2 percent to a record 2,577.74.  Wall Street bankers suggested to Argentine Economy Minister
 Amado Boudou  that the government sell new bonds, saying they
could guarantee a rate of less than 9 percent, newspaper  Ambito
Financiero  reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  “Bank stocks have surged today on the news,”  Federico Rey-Marino , an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc., said by
telephone from Buenos Aires today. “It shows appetite for
Argentine debt, and is giving support to bank fundamentals.”  Other Argentine banks rose, with  BBVA Banco Frances SA 
gaining 6.3 percent to 12.65 pesos,  Grupo Financiero Galicia SA 
rising 4.9 percent to 3.85 pesos and  Banco Hipotecario SA 
increasing 3.4 percent to 1.83 pesos.  According to the report in Ambito Financiero, one
investment bank offered to arrange the sale of $1 billion of
five-year bonds paying 8.75 percent. The proposals were made
during a meeting between Boudou and 35 investment fund managers
at Deutsche Bank AG’s offices in New York, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
