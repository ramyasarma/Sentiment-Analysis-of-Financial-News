Taipei home prices may fall as much
as 5 percent in the short term if the pro-independence
opposition wins in the city’s mayoral elections, according to
 Grand Cathay Securities Corp.   The  Democratic Progressive Party  is leading the ruling
Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, which has dropped a pro-
independence stance and built trade relations with the mainland,
ahead of the municipal elections in Taiwan’s capital on Nov. 27.  Taipei home prices are at the highest since 1991, supported
by record-low interest rates and Taiwan President  Ma Ying-jeou 
push to make economic relations with the mainland the priority
of his administration since he came to power in May 2008.  “There’s speculation in the market that there’s bound to
be a correction in prices if the  Democratic Progressive Party  is
in power, so sentiment is affected,” said  Eric Zhang , an
analyst at Grand Cathay, a company that acts as a broker, dealer
and underwriter for financial securities.  Taiwan and China signed a historic trade agreement in June
that cut tariffs on more over 500 Taiwanese goods. The DPP,
which was in power in Taiwan from 2000 to 2008, says the deal
will allow more Chinese imports into the island and cost jobs.
The party on Dec. 20 rallied about 100,000 people for a street
march to protest the administration’s policies toward China and
the trade agreement.  Rising Prices  Housing prices in Taipei averaged NT$219,000 per ping ($195
per square foot) in 2000 when the DPP got into power and fell
for the next two years, according to  Sinyi Realty Co. , Taiwan’s
biggest real-estate brokerage. Prices in Taipei were NT$489,000
per ping in the second quarter this year. One ping is equivalent
to 35.57 square feet (3.3 square meters).  Taipei home prices have risen 7.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier to the highest since 1991, according
to Sinyi. Residential prices may gain 5 percent this year,
according to Citigroup Inc.  The  central bank  cut key interest rates seven times between
September 2008 and February 2009 to a record low to weather the
global financial crisis. It raised the rate 12.5 basis points in
June to 1.375 percent.  China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has
threatened to invade if the island declares formal independence.
The two sides have been ruled separately since  Chiang Kai-shek’s 
Kuomintang fled to the island after being defeated by Mao
Zedong’s Communists in 1949.  To contact the reporter on this story:
