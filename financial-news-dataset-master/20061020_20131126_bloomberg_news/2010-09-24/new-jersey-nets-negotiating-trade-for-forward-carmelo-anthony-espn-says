(Corrects spelling of Derrick Favors, in second paragraph.)  The New Jersey Nets are close to
acquiring three-time All-Star forward  Carmelo Anthony  from the
Denver Nuggets in a four-team deal,  ESPN reports, citing unnamed
people .  The Nets would trade rookie forward Derrick Favors, the No.
3 pick in this year’s National Basketball Association draft, as
well as multiple first-round picks to the Nuggets for the 26-
year-old Anthony, ESPN reports.  The proposed deal also includes the Utah Jazz and
Charlotte Bobcats. Jazz forward  Andrei Kirilenko  would join the
Nuggets, with the Bobcats acquiring Nets All-Star point guard
 Devin Harris  and Charlotte forward  Boris Diaw  moving to Utah.
The Nets won’t agree on the trade without a guarantee that
Anthony will sign a contract extension, ESPN reports.  Anthony has averaged 24.7 points and 6.2 rebounds a game
over his seven-year career. The 2003 National Collegiate
Athletic Association Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player has
finished in the NBA’s top 10 in scoring average each of the last
five seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
