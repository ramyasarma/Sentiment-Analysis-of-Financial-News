A computer worm called Stuxnet,
which targets Siemens AG software used to control industrial
equipment, may be aimed at destroying a specific plant, possibly
Iran’s controversial nuclear facility, according to Ralph
Langner, a German industrial controls safety expert, the
Financial Times reported.  Langner was speaking at a closed conference in Maryland
this week, the newspaper said.  The virus, which spreads through holes in Microsoft Corp.’s
Windows operating system, is the first aimed at destroying
physical installations; it’s the work of a well financed, highly
organized team, probably associated with a national government,
the FT said, citing security experts.  According to Symantec Corp., which has been investigating
Stuxnet and plans to publish details on Sept. 29, Iran has had
more infections than any other country, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
