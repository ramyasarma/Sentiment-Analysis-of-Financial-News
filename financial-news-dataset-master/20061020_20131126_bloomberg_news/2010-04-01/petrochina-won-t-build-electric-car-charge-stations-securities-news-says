             PetroChina Co. won't build charge
stations for electric cars and has no plans to develop new
energy projects except for non-grain fuel alcohols for the
moment, Shanghai Securities News reported today.  
 PetroChina plans to supply 400 million tons of oil to meet
China's 600 million tons of oil demand in 2020, the newspaper
said, citing the company's Vice President Li Hualin. Half of the
400 million tons of oil will be imported with help from the
company's 2009 overseas acquisitions, Securities said, citing Li.  
 PetroChina is making progress in its negotiation with
Russia to import 68 billion tons of natural gas from the country,
Securities said.
