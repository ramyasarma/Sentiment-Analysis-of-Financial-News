Sachin Tendulkar  passed 14,000 runs
in Test cricket as he helped India recover to 128-2 at the close
of play on day two of the second Test against Australia in
Bangalore.  The 37-year-old, the highest scorer in Tests, finished the
day 44 not out, with  Murali Vijay  unbeaten on 42 as the hosts
chase Australia’s 478 all out.  India is aiming to sweep the two-match series following a
one-wicket win in Mohali in the opening game. That victory
guaranteed that India, the  No. 1-ranked Test team , will retain
the Border-Gavaskar Trophy contested by the two countries
because it can’t lose the series.  If Australia loses the two-match contest, it will fall one
place to fifth in the International Cricket Council’s rankings
and begin the Ashes series next month ranked lower than England.  Tendulkar , last week named the ICC’s player of the year,
came in today with India struggling on 38-2 after  Virender Sehwag  and  Rahul Dravid  were dismissed in successive overs.  Earlier,  Marcus North  hit 128 to lift Australia to 478 in
its first innings. Wicketkeeper Tim Paine scored 59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
