Shanghai prices are “very high”
and excessive investment and speculation activities in the
property market have “seriously distorted” the fundamentals of
the housing market, the city’s mayor Han Zheng said at a press
conference yesterday.  The Shanghai government will follow the central
authorities’ guidelines to rein in property prices and the city
needs to introduce more targeted measures for the local market,
he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
