The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan
is in talks with Temasek Holdings Pte about a possible rival bid
to BHP Billiton Ltd.’s hostile offer for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The two funds, together with Teck Resources Ltd., are
considering an outright takeover offer for the fertilizer
company or buying a minority stake at a higher price than BHP’s
offer of $130 per share, the newspaper said.  Jeffrey Fang, a spokesman for Temasek, Singapore’s state-
owned investment company, declined to comment on the report
to Bloomberg News today. Ontario Teachers’ spokeswoman
Deborah Allan also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
