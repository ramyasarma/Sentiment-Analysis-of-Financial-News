(Corrects currency for value of share purchase in second
paragraph.)  San Miguel Corp. may make a decision
on whether it will submit a takeover proposal to Indophil
Resources NL by Dec. 25, the Australian Financial
Newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  San Miguel has agreed to an exclusivity period until Jan. 10
with Indophil, the Australian-based mining company said on
Friday. San Miguel agreed to buy $40 million of shares at
A$0.86 each.  A takeover bid will need to be priced at least at A$1.28 a
share to win holder support, the newspaper said in its Street
Talk column. That was the price of an offer from China’s Zijin
Mining that was withdrawn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
