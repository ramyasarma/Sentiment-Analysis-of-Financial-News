The United Arab Emirates is
“disappointed” by Canada’s refusal to grant additional landing
rights to U.A.E. carriers, the official  WAM  news agency
reported, citing the U.A.E.’s ambassador to Canada.  Mohammed Abdullah al-Ghafli said the failure will certainly
affect relations between the two countries, after five-year
talks concluded, the news service said.  Canada is preparing to relocate forces bound for
Afghanistan to Cyprus from a base near Dubai after the talks on
landing rights broke down, Toronto’s  Globe And Mail  reported on
Oct. 8, citing people familiar with the talks. The U.A.E. gave
Canada 30 days to relocate its troops, the newspaper said.  U.A.E. carriers, including Emirates airline, have been
seeking dozens of new landing slots in Canada, contending that
the six weekly flights currently allowed are not enough to cover
demand. Transport Canada, the government agency that oversees
the airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots
on concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada’s
traffic to cities such as Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
