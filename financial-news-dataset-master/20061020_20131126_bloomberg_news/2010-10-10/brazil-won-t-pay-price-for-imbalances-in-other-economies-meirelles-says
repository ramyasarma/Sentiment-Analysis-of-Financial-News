Brazil “did its part” by balancing
its economy and won’t pay the price for imbalances in some other
countries, central bank president  Henrique Meirelles  said.  Brazil isn’t adding to imbalances in the world economy and
will protect its own economy from contagion from abroad,
Meirelles told reporters today in Washington, on the sidelines
of the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting.  “Brazil won’t pay the price for several countries’
imbalances,” Meirelles said. “Our position is: ‘Brazil will
protect its economy regardless.’”  Brazil increased its  foreign reserves  by 16.4 percent this
year, to $279 billion on Oct. 7, according to central bank data.
The government has vowed to use its sovereign wealth fund to buy
dollars in the spot market, if needed. Brazil also doubled to 4
percent a tax it charges foreigners on investment in fixed-
income securities in a bid to stem gains in the real, which last
week reached its strongest in more than two years.  Meirelles cited, among other factors, the development of
its domestic market, the outlook for  2 million new jobs  this
year,  inflation  under control and elevated reserves as examples
of Brazil’s stability.  Meirelles also said the global imbalance in part reflect
moves by some highly indebted countries to adopt expansionary
policies, while others, still very dependent on exports, haven’t
developed domestic markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
