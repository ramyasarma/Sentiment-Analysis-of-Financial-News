Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s third-largest iron ore exporter, signed a $2.04
billion loan to replace project-based notes as it seeks to
expand its mining operations.  The new facility will save Perth-based Fortescue A$60
million ($58 million) annually with that figure likely to be
worth “hundreds of millions” in future years, Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Forrest  told reporters on a conference call today.  The loan, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, matures in 2015 with an initial interest
rate of 7.5 percent linked to the London interbank offered rate,
or Libor.  The notes, which will be redeemed within a month at a
premium of $650 million, were issued in August 2006 so the
company could construct its initial mine, port and rail
infrastructure. Forrest said the bank loans would allow
Fortescue to pursue expansion as the notes had restricted its
ability for developments outside its Chichester Hub operation.  Earlier this year, the company outlined plans to target
annual production of 355 million metric tons of ore, up from 40
million metric tons currently, through development of the
Solomon and Western Hub projects.  Forrest said today’s announcement doesn’t affect its
relationship with Leucadia National Corp., Fortescue’s third
largest investor. The companies are in dispute over a separate
debt note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
