Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. , China’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, said profit for the first
nine months may have risen by between 170 percent and 190
percent from a year ago, more than earlier forecast.  Steel prices were higher than expected and the strong
Chinese currency also helped, the Shanghai-based company said in
a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. Profit for the nine
months ended Sept. 30 last year was 3.7 billion yuan, it said.  The steelmaker in October raised prices for its benchmark
products for the first time in five months as falling output in
the nation trimmed oversupply. Baoshan Steel in August forecast
its nine-month profit may rise 140 percent to 160 percent from a
year ago.  -- Dingmin Zhang . Editor:  Tan Hwee Ann   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
