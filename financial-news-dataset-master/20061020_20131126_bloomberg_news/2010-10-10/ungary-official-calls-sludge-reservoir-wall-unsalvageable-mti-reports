The red sludge reservoir in Hungary
that burst last week is “unsalvageable” because of its cracked
walls, said Zoltan Illes, a state secretary for the environment,
according to  MTI  news service.  “The tragedy may occur within a day or within a month,”
Illes said, MTI reported. Authorities are building a dike
through a nearby village to prevent the sludge from spreading
after a possible burst, he said, according to the Budapest-based
news service.  Experts expect the wall to collapse and are working to
contain the spill, Illes told MTI. A half-meter (20 inches)
wide, 25 meter (82 feet) long crack widened from yesterday
because of evening moisture, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
