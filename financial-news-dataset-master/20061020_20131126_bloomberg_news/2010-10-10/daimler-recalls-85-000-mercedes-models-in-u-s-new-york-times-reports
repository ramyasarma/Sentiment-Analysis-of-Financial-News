Daimler AG  is recalling 85,000
Mercedes-Benz models in the U.S. over a steering problem that
could make vehicles difficult to control, the  New York Times 
reported, citing a report submitted by the German carmaker to
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The recall affects the 2010 C-Class and the 2011 E-Class
models, the newspaper said. Daimler said in the report that a
connection fitting on the high-pressure power steering line
might not be tight enough, allowing power-steering fluid to
leak, according to the New York Times.  Daimler spokesmen  Joerg Howe ,  Marc Binder  and  Florian Martens  failed to respond to calls to their mobile phones
requesting comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
