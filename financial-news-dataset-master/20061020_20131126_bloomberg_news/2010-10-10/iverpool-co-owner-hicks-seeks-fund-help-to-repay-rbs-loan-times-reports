Liverpool FC co-owner Tom Hicks is
working with American hedge fund Mill Financial to raise funds
to repay a 280 million-pound ($447 million) loan from Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc due on Friday, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Mill Financial effectively controls 50 percent of shares in
Liverpool as co-owner George Gillett defaulted on the loan the
fund provided for Gillett’s part in the 2007 takeover, according
to the newspaper.  In addition to securing the RBS loan repayment, Hicks will
have to win the case currently in the High Court to prevent
Liverpool’s sale to New England Sports Venture, the newspaper
reported, citing an unidentified source close to the club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
