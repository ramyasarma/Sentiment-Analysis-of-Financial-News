Martin Kaymer  won golf’s Dunhill
Links Championship in Scotland today as  Lee Westwood  missed an
opportunity to replace  Tiger Woods  atop the world rankings.  Kaymer shot a final round 66 at St. Andrews to finish on
17-under-par 271 for the tournament, three shots ahead of
England’s Danny Willett. It was a third straight victory for the
25-year-old German, who was also part of Europe’s winning Ryder
Cup team.  Kaymer claimed the PGA Championship in the U.S. in August,
before last month taking the KLM Open in the Netherlands. Today
was his eighth success on the European Tour.  He receives a check for 580,046 euros ($808,530) for
winning the tournament, which is played on rotation on three
courses -- Carnoustie, Kingsbarns and St. Andrews, with the
latter also hosting the final round.  England’s John Parry was third on 13-under, one shot ahead
of countryman Gary Boyd.  Simon Dyson  of England, Scotland’s
Martin Laird and  Alvaro Quiros  of Spain were 11-under.  Westwood, who needed a top-two finish to oust Woods in the
rankings, slipped to 11th today after a 1-over final round. The
Englishman had been struggling with a calf injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
