Kevin Kolb  helped lead the
Philadelphia Eagles to a 27-24 win at San Francisco in place of
the injured  Michael Vick , dropping the 49ers to 0-5 and their
worst start in 31 years.  Kolb passed for 253 yards and a touchdown for the Eagles,
who withstood a fourth-quarter rally by the 49ers by
intercepting  Alex Smith  with 28 seconds left at Candlestick Park.
Philadelphia forced five turnovers.  While the 49ers are one of three winless teams in the
National Football League -- joined by Buffalo and Carolina --
there is no undefeated team left after the Indianapolis Colts
beat the Kansas City Chiefs 19-9 yesterday.  “We certainly knew this was going to be a tough test
playing the Chiefs. They had a lot of momentum,” Colts
quarterback  Peyton Manning  said during a news conference. “We
knew we were going to get their best shot.”  Adam Vinatieri  kicked four field goals and  Mike Hart  had a
rushing touchdown with 4:02 remaining as the Colts dropped the
Chiefs to 3-1. It’s the first season since 1970 that the NFL
hasn’t had at least one team start with a 4-0 record.  “We had our opportunities, unfortunately we weren’t able
to capitalize,” Chiefs quarterback  Matt Cassel  said during a
news conference. “Our guys did a great job competing,
unfortunately we didn’t come out on top this week.”  Giants’ Rout  The New York Giants beat the Houston Texans 34-10 at
Reliant Stadium in Houston as  Eli Manning  threw two of his three
touchdowns to  Hakeem Nicks .  The Giants’  Osi Umenyiora  had two sacks, forced a fumble
and helped lead a defense that held  Arian Foster  -- the NFL’s
leading rusher -- to 25 yards on 11 carries.  “When the offense is playing well, the defense is playing
well and we just feed off each other,” Umenyiora said.  The Giants, Eagles and Washington Redskins all have 3-2
records in the National Football Conference’s East Division. The
Redskins beat the Green Bay Packers 16-13 in overtime on a 33-
yard field goal by  Graham Gano .  The Baltimore Ravens improved to an NFL-best 4-1 with a 31-
17 win over the Denver Broncos as  Ray Rice  rushed for 133 yards
and two touchdowns. Atlanta and Chicago also have 4-1 records,
with the Falcons beating the Cleveland Browns 20-10 and the
Bears defeating the Carolina Panthers 23-6.  Saints Lose  The Arizona Cardinals intercepted  Drew Brees  three times
and scored 17 fourth-quarter points to beat the Super Bowl-
champion New Orleans Saints 30-20.  Dallas quarterback  Tony Romo  also threw three interceptions
and the Cowboys were beaten at home by the Tennessee Titans 34-
27.  Chris Johnson  rushed for 131 yards and a pair of fourth-
quarter scores for the Titans, who improved to 3-2 and dropped
the Cowboys to 1-3.  While Romo threw for 406 yards, he was sacked six times and
Dallas had a season-high 12 penalties for 133 yards.  “We beat ourselves. We know that,” Cowboys coach  Wade Phillips  said. “I don’t have any qualms about our heart, but
our execution needs to be better.”  Elsewhere in Week 5, it was Jacksonville 36, Buffalo 26;
Tampa Bay 24, Cincinnati 21; Detroit 44, St. Louis 6, and
Oakland 35, San Diego 27.  The New York Jets host the Minnesota Vikings tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
