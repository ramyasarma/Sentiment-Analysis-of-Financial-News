Energy companies planning Australian
liquefied natural gas projects face escalating costs to attract
skilled workers, tap remote offshore fields and raise safety
standards after the  BP Plc  oil spill, Fitch Ratings said.  While the large capital expenditure required for proposed
LNG ventures will put “negative pressure” on the companies,
they also are set to benefit from increasing Asian demand for
the fuel, Fitch said in a report today.  “The scale and timing of capex will restrict their ability
to fully debt fund proposed projects without impairing their
credit quality,”  Sajal Kishore , director in Fitch’s energy and
utilities team, said in an e-mailed statement accompanying the
analysis. “However, Fitch expects these companies to continue
to use an appropriate mixture of debt and equity.”  Australian projects can expect “strong medium-term”
growth in LNG exports, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
