Chelsea defender  John Terry  pulled
out of England’s squad for the Euro 2012 qualifier against
Montenegro in two days because of a back injury.  Terry is the third England player to withdraw from the game
at London’s Wembley Stadium after  Aaron Lennon  and  Phil Jagielka 
were forced out with back and hamstring injuries, respectively.  The Football Association said in a statement there will be
“no further call-ups,” meaning that  Rio Ferdinand  is set to
partner Joleon Lescott or Gary Cahill in the center of defense
as  Fabio Capello ’s team seeks to maintain its perfect record in
qualifying for the European Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
