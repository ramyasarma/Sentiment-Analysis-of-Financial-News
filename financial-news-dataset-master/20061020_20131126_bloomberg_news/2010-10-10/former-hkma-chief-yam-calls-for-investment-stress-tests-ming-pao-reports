Former Hong Kong Monetary Authority
Chief Executive Joseph Yam said financial markets and the so-
called real economy have decoupled and there is a risk of a
bubble bursting, Hong Kong’s Ming Pao Daily reported today.  He urged governments, companies and individuals to conduct
stress tests on their investments and assess whether they can
cope with a decline in stock prices of between 30 and 40 percent
and a 5 percentage point rise in interest rates, the Chinese-
language report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
