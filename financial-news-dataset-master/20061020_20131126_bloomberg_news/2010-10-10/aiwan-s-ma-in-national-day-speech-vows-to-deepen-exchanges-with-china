Taiwan’s President  Ma Ying-jeou 
pledged to deepen economic and cultural exchanges with China in
an address to mark the island’s National Day.  “We handle relations with the mainland based on pragmatic
policies,”  Ma  told a crowd gathered in the square in front of
his office today. “We’ll also continue to strengthen deep
exchanges with the mainland in economical, cultural, social and
various aspects.” His speech was broadcast on local television
channels.  Ma’s government, elected in March 2008 on a platform to
forge closer ties with China, has signed 14 agreements with the
mainland, easing curbs on investment, trade and transportation
links. China claims Taiwan to be part of its territory and has
more than 1,000 missiles pointing at the island.  “Both Taiwan and China are parts of the Chinese people,”
Ma said today. “The two sides should expand cooperation in the
international society and avoid confrontation.”  Taiwan  and China signed an Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement on June 29, aimed reducing tariffs on cross-strait
trade and widening access to each other’s markets. China is the
island’s biggest trading partner and No. 1 overseas investment
destination  Taiwan’s National Day celebrates the 1911 overthrow of
China’s last emperor by the Nationalists, later the Kuomintang,
who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after being defeated in a civil war
with  Mao Zedong ’s Communists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
