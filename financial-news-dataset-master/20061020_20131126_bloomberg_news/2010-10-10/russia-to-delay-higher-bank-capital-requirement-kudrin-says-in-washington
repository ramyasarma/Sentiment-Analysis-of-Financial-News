Russia will delay a proposed
increase in the minimum capital requirement for banks to 1
billion rubles ($33.5 million) because of continued “tension”
in the banking industry, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  The limit won’t be raised “until we see stability in the
international financial sector,” Kudrin told reporters late
yesterday in Washington, where he’s taking part in the
International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting. “It’s necessary
to increase capital requirements but it’s too early to introduce
this proposal because of the remaining tension in the sector.”  Increasing minimum capital to 1 billion rubles would spur
consolidation and could cut the number of banks by 50 percent to
about 500, Kudrin said Nov. 25, adding that he was prepared to
introduce the measure in a year.  The new capital buffers will go into effect five years
after the measure is approved, Kudrin said.  The minimum capital level is already scheduled to rise to
180 million rubles on Jan. 1, 2012, from 90 million rubles
today. Russia had 1,036 lenders on Sept. 1, down from 1,058 at
the start of the year, central bank data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
