Ireland’s building industry
contracted in September for the 40th month in a row, as new
orders fell for the first time in three months.  The construction index dropped to 44.5 last month from 48.4
in August, Ulster Bank Ltd. said in a monthly report published
today. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “It appears that greater concern about the outlook for the
wider economy weighed heavily on firms’ expectations about
future business activity -- not all that surprising perhaps
given the negative news flow related to the banking sector and
the public finances last month,”  Simon Barry , chief economist
at Ulster Bank said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
