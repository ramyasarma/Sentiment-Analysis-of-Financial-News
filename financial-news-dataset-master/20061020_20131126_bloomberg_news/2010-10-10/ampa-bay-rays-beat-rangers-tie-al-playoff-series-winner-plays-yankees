Evan Longoria hit a two-run home run
and a pair of doubles to lead the Tampa Bay Rays to a 5-2 win
against the Texas Rangers, evening their American League
Division Series at two games apiece and forcing a decisive Game
5 on Oct. 12 in Florida.  The Rays, who were five outs from elimination before
rallying to win Game 3 yesterday, completed a sweep of the two
games at Arlington, Texas, after losing the first two games of
the series at home. The 2001 New York Yankees are the only team
to rally from a two-game deficit in a best-of-five Major League
Baseball playoff series after losing the first two games at
home.  The Rangers, who got a solo home run from Nelson Cruz
today, still never have won a postseason game at home.  The winner of the series faces the Yankees, who won their
first-round series 3-0 against the Minnesota Twins, in the
American League Championship Series starting Oct. 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
