Masdar, the Abu Dhabi government-
backed renewable energy company, abandoned plans for Masdar City
to be carbon-neutral from the start and delayed the city’s first
phase by two years to 2015.  The project will be completed between 2020 and 2025, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “While still aiming to eventually be powered 100 percent
by renewable energy, Masdar City will no longer rely solely on
on-site clean energy sources,” the company said. “The purchase
of renewable energy from off-site locations may also be utilized
as energy demands increase over the project’s lifetime.”  Founded in 2006, Masdar City is the showpiece of Abu
Dhabi’s pursuit of alternative energy. The $22 billion venture,
which includes a research university, was reviewed this year
after the financial crisis caused spending reductions.  Masdar is also scaling back the Personal Rapid Transport
system consisting of electric driverless vehicles known as pods,
the statement said. The company will test alternative vehicle
technologies instead, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
