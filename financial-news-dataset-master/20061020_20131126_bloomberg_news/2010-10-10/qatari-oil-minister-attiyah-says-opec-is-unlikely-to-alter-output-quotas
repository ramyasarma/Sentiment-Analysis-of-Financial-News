OPEC is unlikely to change oil
production quotas when the group meets Oct. 14 in Vienna,
Qatar’s energy minister said in a telephone interview.  “I don’t think there will be any shift” in quotas by OPEC,
Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said by phone today after
a meeting in Kuwait with officials from other oil-producing
nations in the Persian Gulf. “I think producers and consumers
are happy” with the current price of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
