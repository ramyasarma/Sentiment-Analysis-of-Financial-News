Oil advanced for a second day in New
York as the dollar fell against the euro after bigger-than-
expected U.S. job losses spurred speculation that the Federal
Reserve will buy more debt to boost the economy.  Futures rose 1.2 percent on Oct. 8 after the Labor
Department said employers cut 95,000 workers in September
following a revised 57,000 decrease in August. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a drop
of 5,000. A weaker U.S. currency increases the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  “The market is pricing in a high probability of
quantitative easing and so the U.S. dollar has come off,” said
 Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “A lot of it seems to be
because of the weaker non-farm payrolls number.”  Crude for November delivery gained as much as 84 cents, or
1 percent, to $83.50 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $83.24 at 3:02 p.m.
Singapore time. Futures climbed 99 cents to $82.66 on Oct 8.
Prices are up 4.9 percent this year.  The dollar lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1.4012 per euro,
after closing at $1.3939 on Oct. 8 in New York. The Fed may
purchase bonds in a strategy known as quantitative easing,
weakening the U.S. currency and boosting dollar-denominated
commodities.  Brent crude for November settlement climbed as much as 65
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $84.68 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. It jumped 60 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $84.03 on Oct. 8.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds raised bullish bets on oil to the highest level
in more than five months amid speculation that the Federal
Reserve will enact further stimulus measures to keep the
economic recovery on track.  Hedge funds and other large speculators  increased wagers  on
rising crude prices by 44 percent in the seven days ended Oct. 5,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
Commitments of Traders report. It was the highest level since
April 23.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.7
percent to 461.82. The gauge has rallied 30 percent from this
year’s May 25 low amid signs a U.S. recovery is regaining
momentum and that China’s economic expansion will continue.  OPEC Meeting  OPEC may leave oil production unchanged when it meets in
three days’ time because signs of a recovery in demand have yet
to emerge among the world’s developed economies.  The oil market is “a little oversupplied,” Mohamed al-
Hamli, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, the third-
biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, said Oct. 9. OPEC members are all exceeding their
allotted quotas after prices surged 78 percent in 2009 and a
further 4 percent this year.  “I don’t think there will be any shift” in quotas by OPEC,
Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said in a phone
interview yesterday after meeting in Kuwait with ministers from
Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations. “Producers and
consumers are happy” with current oil prices, he said.  Deutsche Bank AG raised its fourth-quarter 2010 and first-
quarter 2011 forecasts for both Nymex and Brent oil to $80 a
barrel, a level compatible with equity and currency levels,
according to an Oct. 8 report by  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist. The bank’s previous forecasts, in mid-September, were
$70 for the fourth quarter and $75 for the first.  To contact the reporter on this story:
