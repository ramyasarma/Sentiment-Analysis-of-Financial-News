Peyton Manning threw for 244 yards
to lead the Indianapolis Colts to a 19-9 victory against the
Kansas City Chiefs, leaving the National Football League with no
undefeated team this season.  The Chiefs, who allowed 10 unanswered points in the fourth
period at Indianapolis, had been the only team to start the
season with three straight wins. Their loss means the NFL has
its first season without a 4-0 team in 40 years.  At least one NFL team started 10-0 in each of the previous
five seasons, and two teams won their first 13 games last
season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
