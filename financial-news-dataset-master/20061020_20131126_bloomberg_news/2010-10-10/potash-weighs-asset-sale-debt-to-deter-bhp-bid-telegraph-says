Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. is
considering selling its nitrogen and phosphorous assets and
paying shareholders a dividend of up to $70 a share, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  Potash Corp. may try to use the asset sale, and add at
least another $4 billion to its $3 billion in debt, to repel a
hostile bid from BHP Billiton Ltd., the newspaper said.  Potash spokesman Bill Johnson in Saskatoon, 
Saskatchewan declined to comment on the report when contacted
by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
