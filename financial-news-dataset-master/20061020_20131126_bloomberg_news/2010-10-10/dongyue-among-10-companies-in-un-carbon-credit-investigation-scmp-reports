Dongyue Group Ltd., a Hong Kong-
listed Chinese refrigerant-maker, is among 10 Asian companies
being probed by the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism
for alleged abuses aimed at profiting from the global carbon
credit trading system, the South China Morning Post reported
today. The 10, seven based in China, are suspected of producing
excess amounts of HFC-23, a super greenhouse gas also known as
fluoroform, that is then destroyed to produce carbon credits,
the Post said without saying where it otained the information.
Dongyue Co-Founder Cui Tongzheng denied the allegation, the Hong
Kong-based English-language newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
