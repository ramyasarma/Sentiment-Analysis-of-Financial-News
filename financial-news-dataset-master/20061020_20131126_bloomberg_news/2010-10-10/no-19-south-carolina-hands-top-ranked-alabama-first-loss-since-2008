Stephen Garcia passed for 201 yards
and three touchdowns to lead No. 19 University of South Carolina
to a 35-21 win over top-ranked University of Alabama, which lost
its first regular-season college football game since its opener
in 2008.  The  Gamecocks  were 0-4 against top-ranked schools before
today’s win over the undefeated Crimson Tide at Williams Brice
Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina.  South Carolina (4-1) had a 21-9 lead at half time after
Garcia connected with Marcus Lattimore and twice with Alshon
Jeffery for touchdowns. Defending national champion  Alabama 
scored on Jeremy Shelley’s 32-yard field goal and Greg McElroy’s
8-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones.  In the second half, Lattimore, who had 93 total yards
rushing, ran for two touchdowns as the Gamecocks clinched the
victory after Alabama’s McElroy narrowed the lead to 28-21 with
a touchdown at 14:51 of the fourth quarter.  McElroy completed 27 of 34 attempts for 315 yards and two
touchdowns for Alabama (5-1). The Crimson Tide had won 29
consecutive regular-season games before today’s loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
