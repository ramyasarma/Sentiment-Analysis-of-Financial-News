Toray Industries Inc. of Japan will
begin supplying Toyota Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. with carbon fiber for car bodies this year, the Nikkei
newspaper reported today.  This will be the first time carbon fiber is used for bodies
of automobiles mass-produced in Japan, the newspaper reported.
The material will improve fuel efficiency because carbon fiber
weighs about one-third that of steel sheet, the Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
