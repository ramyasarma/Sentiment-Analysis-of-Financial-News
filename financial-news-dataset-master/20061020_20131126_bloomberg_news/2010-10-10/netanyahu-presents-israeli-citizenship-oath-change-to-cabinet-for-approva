Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said a proposed change in the citizenship oath that
stresses Israel’s Jewish and democratic nature is necessary amid
attempts to erode the country’s self-definition.  “To my regret, today there are attempts to blur not only
the unique link between the Jewish people and their homeland,
but also the connection between the Jewish people and their
state,” Netanyahu told the Cabinet before a vote on the change
today, according to comments posted on his  Website .  The proposal comes as the U.S. increases pressure on
Netanyahu to renew a 10-month freeze in West Bank construction
that ended on Sept. 26. The Arab League has backed the
Palestinian Authority’s decision not to resume direct peace
talks launched on Sept. 2 until Israel stops the building.  Most members of Netanyahu’s government, including Foreign
Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  who leads the second-largest party in
the coalition, oppose a resumption of the freeze.  “The decision expected today is important,” Lieberman
said today on Army Radio, speaking about the oath vote. “The
argument is over more than just borders. It is on the future
character of the state of Israel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
