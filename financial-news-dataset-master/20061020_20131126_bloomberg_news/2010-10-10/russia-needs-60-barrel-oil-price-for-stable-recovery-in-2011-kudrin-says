Russia  needs oil to average more
than $60 a barrel next year to ensure a sustained recovery from
its record slump in 2009, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.
That’s 21 percent less than this year’s average price.  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter, and other
emerging markets face a better outlook and less uncertainty than
developed economies, Kudrin told reporters late yesterday in
Washington, where he’s taking part in the International Monetary
Fund’s annual meeting.  “Developing markets are generally seen in a more positive,
optimistic light by everyone,” Kudrin said.  The world economy will expand 4.2 percent next year, the
IMF said in an Oct. 6 report, compared with a July forecast of
4.3 percent. Developing nations will grow 6.4 percent next year,
unchanged from the previous estimate, while advanced economies
will expand 2.2 percent, down from an earlier 2.4 percent
forecast, according to the IMF.  Urals blend, Russia’s benchmark for oil exports, has risen
7.3 percent to $82.31 a barrel this year. It  averaged  $76.08
during the period and dropped to a low of $67.31 on May 25,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Russia’s gross domestic product grows by about half a
percentage point for every $10 increase in the price of oil,
according to Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach .  The economy will expand more than 4 percent in 2011, Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  said Sept. 8. The Economy Ministry
forecasts growth of 3.9 percent to 4.5 percent in the next three
years. Annual growth may slow to 2 percent in 2011-2013 if
prices for oil and gas fall, Klepach said this week.  The government estimates GDP will increase 4 percent in
2010 after last year’s 7.9 percent contraction, the biggest
since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
