The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 8.23 cents to $2.7714 a
gallon as crude oil prices increased and supplies of the motor
fuel declined, according to  Trilby Lundberg , a fuels analyst.  The price covers the two-week period ended Oct. 8 and is
determined from a survey of 2,500 filling stations nationwide by
 Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in Camarillo,
California. Lundberg’s survey for the two-week period ended
Sept. 24 showed an average price of $2.6891 a gallon.  Gasoline prices rose on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will buy more debt to stimulate the economy after a
government report released Oct. 8 showed a larger-than-expected
decline in U.S. jobs in September, Lundberg said. The Fed may
purchase bonds in a strategy known as quantitative easing,
weakening the U.S. currency and boosting dollar-denominated
commodities.  “The bad unemployment report that has just come out has
added to the speculation that the quantitative easing will be
even more severe than initially expected,” Lundberg said. “Now
we have further expectations of an even weaker dollar to push up
crude oil and gasoline prices.”  The front-month contract for crude oil rose $6.17 in the
two weeks ended Oct. 8, gaining 8.1 percent to $82.66 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude rose on speculation
more Fed stimulus would increase the investment appeal of
dollar-denominated commodities.  Fuel Demand  Gasoline for October delivery traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange gained 20.41 cents, or 10 percent, to
$2.1512 a gallon in the two weeks.  The Energy Department reported on Oct. 6 that that U.S.
 gasoline stockpiles  slid in the week ended Oct. 1 to a 13-week
low as refiners cut processing rates to the lowest level since
March.  Demand , as measured by what refiners and blenders supply
to wholesalers, fell 4.2 percent to an average 8.99 million
barrels a day.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump rose 1.1 percent to the
highest level in four weeks in the seven days ended Oct. 1,
 MasterCard Inc.  said Oct. 5 in its SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $2.92 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3 a
gallon.  The highest price was in San Francisco, at $3.08 a gallon.
The cheapest place to buy the fuel was Tucson, where a gallon
averaged $2.51, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
