Serena Williams  said she is
“heartbroken and devastated” that she is unlikely to return to
tennis until 2011 after aggravating a foot injury that has
sidelined her since winning her fourth Wimbledon title in July.  Williams, 29, withdrew yesterday from a tournament in Linz,
Austria, at which she had planned her comeback. Williams said in
a statement on her  website  that she reinjured the foot while
working out in Florida.  “I am likely out for the year now,” Williams said. “I
feel completely heartbroken and devastated.”  Williams, who lost her No. 1 spot in the world rankings to
Denmark’s  Caroline Wozniacki  when the new rankings were released
today, has said she injured her foot by stepping on glass at a
restaurant in Munich.  The announcement by the 13-time Grand Slam singles champion
came four days after her sister,  Venus Williams , said she would
miss the rest of the 2010 season because of a left knee injury.  The Williams sisters originally were on the U.S. team
selected for the Fed Cup final against Italy, to be played Nov.
6-7 in San Diego.  Serena Williams said she has “to chill on my physical
workouts” until her doctor says she can begin rehabilitation.  “I have been training for many weeks to get back to
playing tennis as quickly as possible since my foot surgery in
mid-July,” she said. “I learned that I had tried too hard, and
did too much too soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
