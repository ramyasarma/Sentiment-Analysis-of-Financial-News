Australian opposition leader  Tony Abbott  visited the country’s troops in Afghanistan a week after
declining to join Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  on a similar trip.  Abbott addressed soldiers in Tarin Kowt in central
Afghanistan, according to an e-mailed transcript of remarks he
made while there.  The opposition leader, who missed out on forming government
when independent lawmakers delivered power to Gillard’s Labor
Party last month, affirmed his support for the nation’s military
involvement in the region. The government holds a two-seat
majority in the House of Representatives after getting the
support of three unaligned parliamentarians and one Greens Party
member.  “Oppositions have some influence and if you don’t tell us,
we can’t improve the support we give you,” the 52-year-old
Abbott said. “While there is bipartisan support for the Afghan
mission, that doesn’t mean that things can’t be improved.”  Abbott visited Afghanistan on the way back from a trip to
the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
