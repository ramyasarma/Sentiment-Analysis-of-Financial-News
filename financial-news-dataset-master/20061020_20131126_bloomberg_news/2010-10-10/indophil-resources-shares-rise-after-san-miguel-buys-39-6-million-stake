Indophil Resources NL, owner of a
third of a $5.2 billion copper project in the Philippines, rose
the most in more than 10 months in Sydney trading after  San
Miguel Corp.  agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the company.  Indophil  gained  7.2 percent to 96.5 cents on the Australian
stock exchange at the 4:10 p.m. local time close. That’s the
most since Dec. 1, 2009.  San Miguel, the Philippines’ biggest food and drinks maker,
agreed last week to buy $40 million of new Indophil shares at 86
Australian cents each. It may also make a control proposal after
studying the Melbourne-based company’s finances, Indophil said
Oct. 8 in a statement.  San Miguel has until Jan. 10 to conduct the study and
Indophil said that it has closed access to its data room to all
other companies. San Miguel plans to submit a proposal within 90
days, President Ramon Ang said in a message sent through mobile
phone today.  Indophil is being advised by Gresham Advisory Partners Ltd.,
Baker & McKenzie and Freehills. San Miguel is being advised by
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Blake Dawson.  -- With assistance by  Cecilia Yap  in Manila. Editors:  Keith Gosman ,  John Viljoen   To contact the reporter on this story:
