Kuwait Energy Co., an oil and gas
company that operates in the Middle East and Eastern Europe,
plans to sell shares in an initial public offering within nine
months.  The shares may be listed in London and Kuwait, subject to
market conditions, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Kuwait Energy’s shareholders approved a plan to raise its
authorized share capital to 127 million dinars from 103.6
million dinars in a rights share offering, the company said.  “The rights issue will enable Kuwait Energy to pursue
organic growth in our expansion plans, to develop recent
discoveries and explore additional wells in our assets in the
region, especially in Egypt,” Chairman and Managing Director
Manssour Aboukhamseen said in the statement.  Kuwait Energy was set up in 2005 and operates in Egypt,
Yemen, Oman, Ukraine, Latvia, Russia and Pakistan, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
