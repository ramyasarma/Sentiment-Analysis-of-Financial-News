Rafael Nadal  beat  Gael Monfils  of
France in straight sets to win the Japan Open tennis tournament
and claim his seventh title of the year.  The 24-year-old Spaniard,  ranked No. 1  by the ATP Tour, won
6-1, 7-5 in Tokyo today. He has won seven of his eight
appearances in finals this season, including victories at the
French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open.  “Every tournament is very important, it is nice to win
another big title like this one,” Nadal said in comments posted
on the ATP’s website. “I won a lot this year, but I have to
appreciate how difficult it is and how much hard work you have
to do.”  Monfils, the world No. 15, has now lost nine of his 11
career finals, and  seven of eight matches  against Nadal. The
Frenchman’s last title was in Metz in September 2009.  Nadal, who collects a check for $261,500, has already
secured his spot in the end-of-season World Tour Finals in
London next month.  Roger Federer  and  Novak Djokovic  have also
qualified for the eight-player event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
