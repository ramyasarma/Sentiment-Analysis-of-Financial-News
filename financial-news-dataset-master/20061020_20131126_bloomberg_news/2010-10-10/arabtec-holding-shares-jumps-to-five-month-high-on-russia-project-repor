Arabtec Holding Co.  rose to the
highest since May after Kommersant reported OAO Gazprom Neft won
approval from the Russian government to build what may become
Europe’s tallest skyscraper. Arabtec has the building contract.  Arabtec  increased  3.7 percent to 2.26 dirhams, the highest
intraday level since May 24, at 11:11 a.m. in Dubai.  Gazprom, the oil unit of Russia’s state natural-gas
producer, was given permission to proceed with the construction
of the 403-meter high (1,300-foot) Okhta Center project in the
center of St. Petersburg, the Moscow-based newspaper said.
Arabtec won the contract in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
