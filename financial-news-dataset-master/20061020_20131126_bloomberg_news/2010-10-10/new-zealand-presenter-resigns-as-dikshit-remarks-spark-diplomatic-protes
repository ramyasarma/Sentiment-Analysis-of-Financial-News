Television New Zealand presenter
Paul Henry has resigned after his comments about the chief
minister of Delhi sparked a formal diplomatic protest.  India lodged a complaint following offensive remarks Henry
made about the pronunciation of Delhi Chief Minister  Sheila Dikshit ’s name. The correct pronunciation is ‘DIKS-it’.  “It is no longer practical in the current environment for
me to do the job I was employed to do, and have so enjoyed
doing,” Henry said in an e-mailed  statement . “I am astonished
and dismayed that my comments have created a diplomatic
incident.”  India called in New Zealand’s High Commissioner on Oct. 7
to formally protest and “strongly and unequivocally” denounce
Henry’s comments. High Commissioner Rupert Holborow apologized
for the remarks.  Henry’s resignation was “the right thing”,  Rick Ellis ,
chief executive officer at state-owned TVNZ in Auckland, said in
a  statement . “The reality is that his comments have split the
community and damaged New Zealand’s international relationships,
and there is no going back from that.”  Henry was suspended without pay for two weeks on Oct. 5
over a separate and later incident in which he asked Prime
Minister  John Key  whether the country’s next governor-general
would be someone who “looks and sounds like a New Zealander”,
in reference to current Governor-General  Anand Satyanand ’s Fiji-
Indian heritage.  To contact the reporter for this story:
