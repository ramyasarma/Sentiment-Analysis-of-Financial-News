Lakshmi Mittal has urged China to
ease its restrictions on foreign investment in an effort to
relieve objections to Chinese companies’ taking stakes in other
countries, such as the U.S., the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  Mittal, the chief executive officer of steel company
ArcelorMittal, said it can’t be expected that people in the U.S.
would be receptive to investments by Chinese companies when
attempts by U.S. entities to invest in China are fraught with
restrictions, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
