China Banking Regulatory Commission
Chairman Liu Mingkang urged a global division of banking and
non-banking businesses so as to avoid a systematic financial
crisis, according to a summary of a speech posted to the
regulator’s website.  Liu called for an international treaty to set up rules for
the bankruptcy of multinational financial institutions,
according to the statement. Liu also warned against a
“significant” cross-border risk in the global financial
system.  The summary, which cited remarks Liu made during a meeting
held on Sept. 22 and 23 in Singapore, was posted to the website
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
