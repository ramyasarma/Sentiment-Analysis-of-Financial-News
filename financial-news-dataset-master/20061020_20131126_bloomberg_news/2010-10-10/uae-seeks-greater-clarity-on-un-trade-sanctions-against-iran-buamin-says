The United Arab Emirates is seeking
greater clarity from the United Nations as it implements the
latest round of trade sanctions with Iran, the director general
of the  Dubai Chamber of Commerce  & Industry said.  “What we hope for is that there is some clarity as far as
what is allowed, what is not allowed, what shipping lines are
allowed, what’s not allowed, which parties we can trade with,
and who we can’t,”  Hamad Buamin , director general of chamber,
said in an interview in Dubai today. “Right now, there is no
clarity.”  Trade between Iran and the U.A.E., which lies across the
Persian Gulf from the Islamic republic, is expected to fall
about 50 percent to $6 billion in 2010 from 2008, according to
Dubai’s Iranian Business Council. Two years ago, the U.A.E. was
Iran’s largest trading partner.  Iran is under a fourth round of UN sanctions because it
refuses to curtail its nuclear energy program, which the U.S.
and its allies say may conceal an effort to develop weapons. The
U.S. tightened sanctions on July 1 to penalize foreign suppliers
of gasoline to Iran. Iran says its nuclear program is designed
to generate electricity for a growing population.  The Dubai Financial Services Authority warned banks to
treat transactions with all Iranian-based entities as “high
risk.” Exports to the Islamic Republic from Dubai fell 9
percent in June from a year earlier, according to the Dubai
Chamber of Commerce.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
