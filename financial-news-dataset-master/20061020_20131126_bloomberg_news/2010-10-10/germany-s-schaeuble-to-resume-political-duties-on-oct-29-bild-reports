German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , suffering from ongoing health problems, is planning
to resume his political duties on Oct. 29,  Bild am Sonntag 
reported, citing no one.  Schaeuble, currently hospitalized with an ailment related
to his wheelchair use, is determined to attend a function in
Heilbronn near Stuttgart on Oct. 29, the newspaper said. The 68-
year-old Schaeuble has no plans to resign from his post, Bild am
Sonntag quoted his deputy, Steffen Kampeter, as saying, citing
talks with Schaeuble this week.  “Whoever suggests that the minister is willing to quit is
simply talking nonsense,” the newspaper quoted Kampeter as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
