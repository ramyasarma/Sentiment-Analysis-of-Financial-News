Hwang Jang Yop , the highest-ranking
North Korean official ever to defect to South Korea, died at his
home today, police said in an e-mailed statement.  Hwang, 87, was found dead in his bathtub at home at about
9:30 a.m. local time by a security guard, according to the
statement. There were no signs of external injury or other
suspicious circumstances, it said. Police will conduct an
autopsy and review security cameras and guards.  Hwang, who defected in 1997, served as secretary of North
Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party and chairman of the Supreme
People’s Assembly, the country’s parliament. He was a vocal
critic of  Kim Jong Il ’s regime and lived under constant police
protection.  South Korean prosecutors in April arrested two North
Koreans on suspicion they were sent to murder Hwang. The two,
identified as Kim Myong Ho and Tong Myong Kwan, posed as
defectors and entered South Korea via Thailand on a mission to
kill Hwang, the  Chosun Ilbo  newspaper reported in April, citing
officials at the intelligence service and prosecutors it didn’t
identify.  Tensions have risen on the peninsula since a South Korean
warship sank in March near the two nations’ disputed maritime
border. North Korea has denied responsibility for what a South
Korean investigation determined was a torpedo attack by a North
Korean submarine.  South Korea and North Korea remain technically at war since
their 1950-53 conflict ended in a cease-fire that was never
replaced by a peace treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
