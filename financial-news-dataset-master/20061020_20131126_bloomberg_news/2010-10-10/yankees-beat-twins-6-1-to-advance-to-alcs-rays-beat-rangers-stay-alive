The New York Yankees beat the
Minnesota Twins 6-1 to complete a three-game sweep of their
first-round playoff series and advance to the American League
Championship Series.  Phil Hughes pitched seven shutout innings in his first
career postseason start for New York, while Marcus Thames and
Nick Swisher hit home runs at Yankee Stadium.   The Yankees also beat the Twins 3-0 in the opening round
last year and have won nine straight Major League Baseball
postseason games against Minnesota dating back to 2004.   The defending World Series-champion Yankees advance to the
ALCS against the Texas Rangers or Tampa Bay Rays.   The Rangers lead their AL series two-games-to-one after
losing earlier today in Arlington, Texas. Texas missed a chance
to win its first postseason series as the Rays scored five runs
over the final two innings for a 6-3 win.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
