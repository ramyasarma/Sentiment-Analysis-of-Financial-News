Fortis Global Healthcare Holdings
Pte., controlled by billionaires  Malvinder Mohan Singh  and
Shivinder Mohan Singh, agreed to buy units of Hong Kong-based
 Quality HealthCare Asia Ltd.  for HK$1.5 billion ($193 million).  The purchase will give Fortis Global a network of more than
60 medical centers, at least 500 affiliated clinics and more
than 40 dental and physiotherapy centers, the closely held
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Singh brothers, ranked as among the 20 wealthiest in
India by Forbes magazine, owns a majority stake in India-listed
 Fortis Healthcare Ltd. , which this year was beaten to the
acquisition of Singapore’s Parkway Holdings Ltd. Fortis Global
will spearhead the family’s international health-care expansion,
Chairman Malvinder Singh said in the statement today.  “There are tremendous opportunities for growth in the
Quality Healthcare businesses, both in Hong Kong and also
potentially in China,” Malvinder Singh said in the statement.  Quality HealthCare, whose shares have been suspended from
Oct. 5, applied to resume trading tomorrow morning. The company
retained its elderly health-care businesses and will consider
paying a special dividend using part of the proceeds, it said in
a  statement  to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  In July, Malvinder Singh said he would be looking for
another company to build upon after walking away from a bidding
war for Parkway, Asia’s largest hospital operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
