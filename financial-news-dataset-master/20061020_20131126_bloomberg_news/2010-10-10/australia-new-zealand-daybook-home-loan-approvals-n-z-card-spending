Industrial Average above 11,000 for the first time since before
the May 6 crash, on speculation the Federal Reserve will buy
more debt to boost the economy.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 percent in the week
to close at 11,006.48. On Oct. 8 the Dow gained 0.5 percent.
*The S&P 500 advanced 1.7 percent to 1,165.15 last week and rose
0.6 percent on Oct. 8.  London: European stocks rose the most in four weeks as investors

the yen reached a 15-year high against the dollar, dimming the

percent to 3,232.66 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell against the euro for a fourth week in

the economic recovery is stalling.

2.4 percent, from 2.51 percent on Oct. 1.  COMMODITIES  GOLD  New York: Gold futures rose, rebounding from the biggest drop

percent, to close at $3.7745 a pound at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex

a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH:
