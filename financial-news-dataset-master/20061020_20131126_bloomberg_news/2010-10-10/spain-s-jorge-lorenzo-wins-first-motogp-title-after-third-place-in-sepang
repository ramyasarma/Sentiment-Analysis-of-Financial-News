Spain’s Jorge Lorenzo won his first
MotoGP world title after finishing third in today’s Malaysian
Grand Prix in Sepang.  The 23-year-old Fiat Yamaha rider has an unassailable  85-
point lead  with three races remaining. Dani Pedrosa of Spain,
his closest rival, missed today’s race after breaking his
collarbone in practice for the Japanese Grand Prix last week.  “Today is the happiest day of my life and we have to
celebrate it,” the British Broadcasting Corp. cited Lorenzo as
saying.  Seven-time MotoGP champion  Valentino Rossi  of Italy won the
race, his first success since the opening event of the season.
His year was disrupted by a broken leg. His countryman, Andrea
Dovizioso, was second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
