Talisman Energy Inc. , the Canadian
oil and natural gas explorer, and  Statoil ASA , Norway’s largest
oil and gas company, said they agreed to pay $1.33 billion for
oil shale properties in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas
and form a joint venture to develop the fields.  Talisman will initially operate the 97,000 acres (39,254
hectares) of oil shale prospects purchased from  Enduring
Resources LLC , the company said in a statement. Statoil will
also buy for $180 million 50 percent of Talisman’s existing
Eagle Ford holdings. For both transactions, Statoil will pay a
total of $843 million, according to a  statement  on its website.
Talisman said its net cost for the acquisition will be $485
million.  The companies have an option to buy as much as 22,000
additional acres. Talisman also has stakes in the Marcellus
shale in the northeastern U.S. and the Montney shale in British
Columbia.  In April, Talisman agreed to sell C$1.9 billion ($1.87
billion) worth of natural-gas fields in Alberta and Ontario to
free cash for shale projects. North American gas producers are
increasing output from shale formations, where rocks hundreds of
feet below the ground are fractured to unlock fuel deposits.  Shale development is driving a surge in U.S. gas output and
has started to draw interest in Poland from companies including
 Exxon Mobil Corp.  and  Chevron Corp .  To contact the reporter on this story:
