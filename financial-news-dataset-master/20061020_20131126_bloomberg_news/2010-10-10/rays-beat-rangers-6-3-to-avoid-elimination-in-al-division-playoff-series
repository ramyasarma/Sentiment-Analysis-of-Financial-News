    The Tampa Bay Rays beat the Texas
Rangers 6-3 to avoid elimination in their American League
playoff series.   Carlos Pena had a run-scoring single and a two-run home run
as the Rays scored five runs in the eighth and ninth innings to
overcome a 2-1 deficit at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  The AL East-champion Rays, who lost the first two games at
home, pulled within 2-1 in the best-of-five AL Division Series.
Game 4 will be tomorrow at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.   The New York Yankees host the Minnesota Twins tonight in
the other AL Division Series. The Yankees hold a 2-0 series lead
and can advance to the AL Championship Series with a win.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
