Volkswagen AG  will expand vehicle
and component production at its German factories in Wolfsburg
and Kassel,  Stuttgarter Zeitung  reported, without citing anyone.  The German carmaker will increase daily output of the
Tiguan compact sport-utility vehicle in Wolfsburg to 1,000 units
next year from 750 and build more two-way shift gearboxes at the
Kassel plant, the newspaper said.  Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen, aiming to surpass  Toyota Motor
Corp.  in sales and profitability, has a goal to increase global
deliveries to 10 million by 2018.  To contact the reporters on this story:
