Ohio State moved up to No. 1 in both
major college football polls, replacing defending national
champion Alabama a day after the Crimson Tide lost to South
Carolina.  Ohio State moved to the top of the Associated Press
writers’ poll and USA Today coaches’ poll. Oregon is No. 2 in
both polls, followed by Boise State, Texas Christian and
Nebraska.  Terrelle Pryor threw three touchdown passes to lead Ohio
State to a 38-10 win against visiting Indiana yesterday. Alabama
lost 35-21 at South Carolina, its first regular-season loss
since its opener in 2008, and dropped to No. 8 in both polls.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
