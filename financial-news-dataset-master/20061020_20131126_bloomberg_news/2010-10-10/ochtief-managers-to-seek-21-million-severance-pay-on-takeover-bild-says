Hochtief AG  board members are
entitled to 14.7 million euros ($20.5 million) in cash
compensation if the German builder is taken over,  Bild  reported,
citing the company’s annual report.  Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Luetkestratkoetter 
qualifies for 4 million euros in severance pay, the Berlin-based
newspaper said in a preview of an article to be published in
tomorrow’s edition. Hochtief is seeking to ward off a takeover
bid by  Actividades de Construccion y Servicios .  An ad-hoc committee of Hochtief’s supervisory board will
meet tomorrow to discuss strategy in the takeover battle with
ACS, spokeswoman  Jutta Hobbiebrunken  said today by phone. She
declined to elaborate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
