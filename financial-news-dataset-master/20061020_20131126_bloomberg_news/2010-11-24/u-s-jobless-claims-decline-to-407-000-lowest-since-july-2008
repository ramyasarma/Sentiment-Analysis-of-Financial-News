Applications for unemployment
benefits in the U.S. fell more than forecast last week to the
lowest level since July 2008, reinforcing evidence the labor
market is healing.  Jobless  claims  declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week
ended Nov. 20, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000. The total number of
people receiving unemployment insurance decreased to the lowest
in two years, and those on extended payments also fell.  Fewer firings lay the groundwork for a pickup in job
creation that will generate incomes and spur consumer spending,
which accounts for 70 percent of the economy. Even with
companies firing fewer workers, unemployment will be slow to
decline, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest forecast in
which policy makers also lowered their growth projections.  “The labor market is clearly improving,” said John
Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in
Charlotte, North Carolina. “We’re seeing consistent job gains
in the private sector. This suggests we’ll have a good holiday
spending season.”  Consumer spending rose in October for a fifth month as a
rebound in incomes lifted the biggest part of the U.S. economy
at the start of the final quarter of 2010, Commerce Department
figures showed today.  Spending and Income  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.3
percent gain in September that was larger than previously
estimated. Incomes climbed 0.5 percent.  Orders for U.S. goods meant to last several years
unexpectedly decreased in October, the Commerce Department also
said. Demand for so-called durable goods dropped 3.3 percent,
the biggest plunge since January 2009, after a revised 5 percent
jump in September that was larger than previously estimated.  Stock-index futures rose and Treasury securities fell after
the reports. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing
next month increased 0.7 percent to 1,186.8 at 8:48 a.m. in New
York. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves
inversely to prices, rose to 2.83 percent from 2.78 percent late
yesterday.  Jobless benefits applications were projected to fall to
435,000 from 439,000 initially reported for the prior week,
according to the median forecast of 48 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Estimates ranged from 420,000 to 450,000. The Labor
Department revised the prior week’s figure up to 441,000.  Effect of Holidays  Claims typically increase during the period between the
Veterans Day and Thanksgiving holidays, and the Labor
Department’s seasonal adjustment process takes that into
account. During the latest week, fewer Americans than usual
filed claims, a Labor Department spokesman said as the figures
were released, allowing seasonally adjusted filings to decrease
more than forecast.  Fed policy makers, who began a second round of large-scale
asset purchases to lift economic growth and reduce unemployment,
disagreed over expanding record monetary stimulus this month,
according to minutes of their Nov. 2-3 policy meeting released
yesterday.  They also projected a fourth-quarter 2011  unemployment rate 
of 8.9 percent to 9.1 percent, compared with 8.3 percent to 8.7
percent in their previous forecast, released in July. For 2012,
the jobless rate will be 7.7 percent to 8.2 percent, up from
prior projections of 7.1 percent to 7.5 percent. The rate was
9.6 percent in October, marking 18 months at 9.4 percent or
higher.  Four-Week Average  The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, declined to 436,000
last week from 443,500, today’s report showed.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 142,000 in the week ended Nov. 13 to 4.18 million.
They were forecast to fall to 4.28 million.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
262,000 to 4.66 million in the week ended Nov. 6.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.3 percent in
the week ended Nov. 13, the lowest since Dec. 6, 2008, from 3.4
percent in the prior week.  States, Territories  Forty-seven states and territories reported a decline in
claims, while six reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in
recent months as some companies continue to cut staff, while
others expand, pointing to an uneven recovery.  The economy grew more than previously calculated in the
third quarter, led by stronger consumer spending and fueled by
labor income gains that may stoke demand into 2011. The revised
2.5 percent increase in gross domestic product compares with a 2
percent estimate issued last month, data from the Commerce
Department showed yesterday.  Companies cutting jobs include Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin Corp. The world’s largest defense contractor
said on Nov. 18 that it will close a plane components plant in
Eagan, Minnesota, by 2013 and move work from its Middle River,
Maryland, site next year, resulting in at least 400 job cuts.  Government agencies are also paring workers. New York City,
facing a $3.3 billion deficit in next year’s budget, will cut
its workforce by more than 10,000 over the next year-and-a-half,
Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s budget office reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
