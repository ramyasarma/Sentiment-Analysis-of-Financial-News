China’s stocks  rose, led by
producers of materials and consumer staples, as investors
speculated losses that drove the benchmark index to a six-week
low were excessive.  Jiangxi Copper Co. climbed 2.5 percent and  PetroChina Co. 
gained 0.8 percent as metal and oil prices rebounded.  Kweichow
Moutai Co.  climbed to the highest level since March 2008, pacing
gains by liquor makers, after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.
said the company may raise product prices by 24 percent.
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  plunged by the 10
percent daily cap as it resumed trading after completing part of
a rights offer.  “The market will stabilize at this level as the previous
sell-off has digested much of the risks arising from policy
tightening,” said  Wang Zheng , chief investment officer at
Jingxi Investment Management Co. in Shanghai. “ICBC’s mainly
playing catch-up after the suspension.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index  rose 31.65, or 1.1 percent, to
close at 2,859.94 at 3 p.m., the biggest gain since Nov. 5. The
gauge had lost more than 10 percent as of yesterday since
reaching an almost seven-month high on Nov. 8 on concern that
accelerated monetary tightening will crimp economic growth. The
 CSI 300 Index  advanced 2.3 percent to 3,177.04.  Inflows of money from the trade surplus, foreign direct
investment, and investors betting on gains by the yuan threaten
to propel consumer prices after unprecedented lending by banks
flooded the economy with cash from late 2008. Consumer prices
rose 4.4 percent in October from a year earlier.  Food Inflation  Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s cabinet last week announced it will
sell grain, cooking-oil and sugar reserves, ordered an end to
tolls on trucks carrying produce and threatened price controls
to rein in a 10 percent inflation rate for food.  An  index  of materials producers traded on the CSI 300
gained 2.3 percent. The measure had fallen 8.6 percent as of
yesterday since the central bank on Oct. 19 raised borrowing
costs for the first time since 2007. Policy makers last week
boosted the amount of money that lenders must set aside for the
fifth time this year.  Jiangxi Copper, the country’s biggest producer of the metal,
advanced 2.5 percent to 35.03 yuan after falling to its lowest
level in almost two months yesterday.  Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. ,
China’s biggest producer of refined zinc, rose 3.1 percent to
15.92 yuan.  PetroChina , the nation’s largest oil producer, added
0.8 percent to 10.95 yuan, snapping a three-day losing streak.  Copper futures in London climbed as much as 1.8 percent
today and zinc gained as much as 2.7 percent after a decline of
4.6 percent. Oil gained as much as 0.8 percent to $81.88 in New
York. Commodities rebounded as concern eased over yesterday’s
artillery-fire exchange between North and South Korea.  Liquor Makers  An index tracking consumer staples producers rallied 3.8
percent, a fifth day of gains, on speculation the companies will
be able to pass on costs. Moutai, China’s biggest producer of
baijiu liquor by market value, jumped 5.8 percent to 199.92 yuan,
the highest close since March 2008.  Moutai may raise its liquor prices by between 20 percent
and 24 percent in late December, analyst  Tong Xun  at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities wrote in a note today. The brokerage set a 12-
month share price estimate of 240 yuan.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. , the second largest, added 3.7 percent
to 39.27 yuan. Luzhou Laojiao Co., a sprits producer in
southwest province of Sichuan, rose 4.7 percent to 46.02 yuan.  China may set a 4 percent inflation target for next year
during the government’s annual central economic work meeting to
be held at the end of this year, the China Business News
reported. The annual target for this year is 3 percent.  Economic Growth  The government’s measures to curb inflation won’t hurt the
stock market or economic growth, Shi Jianxun, a professor from
Tongji University, wrote in a commentary published on the front
page of People’s Daily’s overseas edition today.  Industrial companies rallied after the China Securities
Journal said the government will announce a plan to develop the
nation’s construction machinery industry.  Guangxi Liugong Machinery Co.  jumped the 10 percent daily
limit to 35.50 yuan. Changsha Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &
Technology Development Co., the nation’s second-biggest maker of
concrete-handling machinery, surged 10 percent to 14.26 yuan.
XCMG Construction Machinery Co., the publicly traded unit of
China’s biggest building equipment maker, climbed 10 percent to
53.86 yuan.  ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market value, slumped
the maximum 10 percent to 4.42 yuan, the biggest drag on the
 Shanghai Composite . The benchmark gauge slumped 6.2 percent
during the stock’s weeklong suspension. ICBC said it raised
33.67 billion yuan ($5.06 billion) in the Shanghai part of a
rights offer that was 99.72 percent subscribed. The lender is
also selling about 11 billion yuan of stock in Hong Kong.  Bank of Nanjing Co. , which also resumed trading today after
raising 4.86 billion yuan from a rights issue, dropped 5.8
percent from its last close on Nov. 15 to 10.46 yuan.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Richard Frost ,  Darren Boey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
