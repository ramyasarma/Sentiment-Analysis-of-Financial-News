PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state oil
and gas company, said its Balongan refinery is operating
normally and no units have been shut down.  A pumping unit was repaired yesterday and output was
unaffected as another pump was used, Mochamad Harun, a spokesman
for the Jakarta-based company, said by telephone today.  ICIS, a chemical newsletter, earlier reported that
Pertamina plans to shut a gasoline-making unit at Balongan today
because of technical problems, citing an unidentified company
official. Pertamina has “no plans” to shut down the residual
fluid catalytic cracking unit, Harun said.  The Balongan plant can process 125,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
