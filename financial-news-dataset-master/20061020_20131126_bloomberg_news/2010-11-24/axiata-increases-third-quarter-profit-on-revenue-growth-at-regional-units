Axiata Group Bhd. , the second-best
performer on Malaysia’s benchmark stock index this year, said
third-quarter profit increased 27 percent from a year earlier,
driven by growth at its regional units.  Net income  rose to 639.1 million ringgit ($204 million), or
8 sen a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 503.7
million ringgit, or 6 sen a share, a year ago, the company said
today in a statement to the stock exchange in Kuala Lumpur.
Revenue gained 14.7 percent to 3.9 billion ringgit, it said.  “Despite the competitive environment, we are confident
about our prospects for the rest of the year,” Axiata Chief
Executive Officer  Jamaludin Ibrahim  said in the statement. “The
strong results ultimately put the group in a good position to
meet its dividend plans.”  The company released earnings at the midday trading break.
 Axiata  shares gained 0.2 percent at 4.49 ringgit at 2:48 p.m.
local time. The stock has advanced 47 percent this year,
compared with 17 percent for the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index .  The company, based in Kuala Lumpur, said Aug. 25 it will
start paying out at least 30 percent of profit to shareholders
from next year. The mobile-phone operator has more than 130
million subscribers in countries including India and Indonesia,
helping it counter slowing growth in Malaysia, where the number
of subscriptions exceed the country’s population.  Indonesian unit  PT XL Axiata  boosted third-quarter profit
to 758.7 billion rupiah ($85 million) from 495.1 billion rupiah
a year earlier, according to an Oct. 28 filing to the Jakarta
stock exchange.  Dialog Axiata Plc , its Sri Lanka unit, had a
1.69 billion-rupee ($15 million) profit in the same period, the
company said Oct. 27.  Axiata will focus on non-voice services such as data and
mobile broadband and build on the “strong growth” in these
businesses in Malaysia and Indonesia, Jamaludin said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
