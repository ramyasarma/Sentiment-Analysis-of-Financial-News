President Barack Obama told South
Korean President Lee Myung Bak that the U.S. “stands shoulder
to shoulder” with its Asian ally after North Korea’s artillery
attack near a disputed maritime border.  Obama told Lee in a telephone call that he “strongly
condemned the attack,” according to a White House statement
released late last night in Washington. The two leaders agreed
to hold joint military exercises and training “in the days
ahead.”  “The United States remains firmly and fully committed to
the defense of its ally,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
