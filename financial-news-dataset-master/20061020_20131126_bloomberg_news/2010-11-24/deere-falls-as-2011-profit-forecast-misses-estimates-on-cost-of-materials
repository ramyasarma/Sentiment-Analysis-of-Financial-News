Deere & Co. shares fell after the
world’s largest farm-equipment maker projected less 2011 profit
than analysts estimated amid higher material costs.  The company said earnings excluding some items would amount
to about $4.92 a share, less than the average analyst projection
of $5.34 a share in a Bloomberg survey.  Deere shares fell 1.5 percent to $75.21 at 7:18 a.m. in New
York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
