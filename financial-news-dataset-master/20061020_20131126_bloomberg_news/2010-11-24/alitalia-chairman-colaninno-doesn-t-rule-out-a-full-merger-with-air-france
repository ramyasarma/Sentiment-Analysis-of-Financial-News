Alitalia SpA  Chairman  Roberto Colaninno  said he doesn’t rule out a merger with  Air France-KLM
Group  once the Italian carrier improves its profitability.  “Our goal is to make the company profitable, then we’ll
talk about other plans,” Colaninno told reporters today in
Milan. Asked if he rules out a combination with Air France,
which owns 25 percent of Rome-based Alitalia, Colaninno said,
“in life, I don’t exclude anything.”  Chief Executive Officer  Rocco Sabelli  favors a merger with
the French carrier, Ansa news agency reported Nov. 2., citing an
advance copy of a book by journalist Bruno Vespa, who quotes
comments by Sabelli.  Air France has no immediate plans to increase its stake in
Alitalia, CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told reporters Nov. 17.  Alitalia on Oct. 28 reported third-quarter net income of 39
million euros ($52.3 million) compared with 1 million euros the
year before. The company expects to report a full-year loss this
year and break even at operating level in 2011, Sabelli told Il
Sole 24 Ore in an Oct. 30 interview.  Alitalia also today signed a code-sharing agreement with
Jet Airways (India) Ltd. and wants the Mumbai-based airline to
join the SkyTeam alliance led by Air France and Delta Air Lines
Inc., Sabelli said.  “We’re studying their proposal,” Jet Airways Chairman
 Naresh Goyal  said today in Milan. “We haven’t decided yet.” Jet
Airways will operate a non-stop Milan-New Delhi flight beginning
Dec. 5 and also plans to add Rome-Mumbai service in winter 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
