  European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.  said it is exploring U.S. takeover targets in the $500
million range and will consider servicing military planes to
broaden its presence in the world’s biggest defense market.  EADS, based in Paris and Munich, has a goal of winning $10
billion in annual sales in the U.S., not counting sales of
commercial Airbus SAS airliners, said  Sean O’Keefe , the chief
executive of EADS’s North American unit.  “It’s a big, hairy, audacious goal but one I think is
attainable,” O’Keefe said in a briefing in the U.S. on Nov. 22.  The Airbus division provides about two thirds of EADS’s $43
billion ($57 billion) annual sales. EADS also makes military and
civil helicopters as well as refueling aircraft, which it’s
marketing to the Pentagon. Other products include a military
transport plane that EADS aims to sell in the U.S. in the next
decade.  EADS isn’t “restricting” itself and could pay more for
companies than $500 million, said O’Keefe. The company will also
pursue expansion without acquisitions, with options to service
U.S. military transports and Coast-Guard aircraft and
helicopters, which O’Keefe called “natural markets” as EADS
already performs such services for aircraft outside the U.S.  “Hitting the service industry is a natural,’ he said.
“It’s a very easy fit and one we’re looking at very
aggressively for the kind of things we do real well.”  O’Keefe, 54, survived a small-plane crash in August and
returned to work in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
