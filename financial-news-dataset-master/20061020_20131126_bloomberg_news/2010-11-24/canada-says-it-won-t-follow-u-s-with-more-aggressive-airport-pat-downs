Transport Minister  Chuck Strahl  said
that the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority won’t
implement more aggressive pat-down searches, saying that air
travelers should be treated with “respect.”  “While the Americans have instituted a more intensive, if
we can call it that, pat-down technique, that’s not happening in
Canada,” Strahl told reporters in Ottawa today. “It’s a
completely different system.”  Strahl also said Canadian body scanners are different than
U.S. ones because they don’t use potentially harmful radiation.  Travelers in the U.S. who opt out of a scan must submit to
a pat-down, with agents using the palm side of their hands and
fingers instead of the back, which was the previous practice.
Agents are allowed to feel around breasts and genitals for
hidden items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
