Porsche SE , the maker of the 911
sports car, said operating profit surged more than sevenfold in
the fiscal first quarter on demand for the Cayenne sport-utility
vehicle and Panamera sedan.  Earnings before interest and tax advanced to 395 million
euros ($526 million) between August and October from 52 million
euros a year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer
said in an e-mailed statement. Sales climbed 80 percent to 2.1
billion euros.  Deliveries of the Cayenne, Porsche’s best-selling model,
more than doubled to 10,292 SUVs, while the Panamera, which went
on sale about a year ago, also almost doubled to 5,778 cars.
 Porsche , which will switch to calendar-year reporting in 2011,
expects a return on sales that is “clearly” more than 10
percent in the last five months of 2010, it said today.  “It’s a fairly good set of numbers and clearly highlights
that Porsche’s core business is doing well,” said  Alexis Albert , a Nomura Securities analyst in London with a “reduce”
rating on the shares.  Porsche  gained  as much as 2.83 euros, or 5.3 percent, to
55.90 euros and was up 4.8 to 55.64 euros as of 11:17 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading, valuing the company at 9.73 billion euros.  Porsche is in the process of merging with  Volkswagen AG ,
Europe’s largest carmaker. VW acquired 49.9 percent of Porsche’s
car-making unit after Porsche last year failed in a hostile
takeover attempt for Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW.  ‘Profitable Growth’  Porsche’s first-quarter European deliveries rose 63 percent
to 7,082 cars, of which 2,318 were sold in Porsche’s German
home-market. North American sales totaled 6,632 units, the
manufacturer said, without providing year-earlier figures.  “Porsche continues to be on a profitable growth course,”
 Matthias Mueller , head of the automotive division, said in the
statement.  Volkswagen  agreed to combine with Porsche in August 2009
after the sports-car maker’s debt tripled to more than 10
billion euros following a failed bid to buy VW by securing stock
through options trading.  VW Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said Oct. 19
that the planned combination with Porsche may be put on hold
until U.S. lawsuits and German tax-related hurdles are resolved.
Porsche is being sued by U.S.-based short sellers of VW stock
who claim the manufacturer secretly cornered the market in VW
shares and later caused them more than $1 billion in losses.  Porsche  shareholders will be asked Nov. 30 to approve a
capital increase of about 5 billion euros in the first half of
next year, with the carmaker’s controlling shareholders, the
Porsche and Piech families, due to contribute 2.5 billion euros.  The capital increase, which may also include selling
convertible bonds, will help Porsche pay back a 2.5-billion euro
bank loan slated to expire June 30, 2011. Lenders have agreed to
give  Porsche  additional time until Oct. 31, 2011, to repay the
facility should the capital increase be thwarted or delayed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
