Asian fuel-oil refining margins
gained for a second day amid speculation that imports into
Singapore may fall. Naphtha’s premium to Brent snapped three
days of declines after Royal Dutch Shell Plc purchased a cargo.  Light Distillates  The premium of naphtha for delivery to Japan to Brent crude
widened to $147.43 a metric ton at 5:42 p.m. Singapore time from
$138.83 a ton at the end of Asian trading yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium increased for the
first time since Nov. 18.  Open-specification naphtha  for delivery to Japan rose $8,
or 1 percent, to $778.25 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. Benchmark
 92-RON gasoline  gained 55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $89 a
barrel.  Asia gasoline’s premium to naphtha, or the  reforming
margin , fell to $4.05 a barrel from $4.40, Bloomberg
calculations showed. It was at $6 on Nov. 8, the highest this
month. A narrowing gap signals naphtha is more valuable to
refiners relative to gasoline.  Shell bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half January
delivery from Noble Group at $780 a ton, the only cargo of light
distillates traded today, traders said.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel  rose 0.2 percent to $95.65 a barrel in Singapore
after Glencore International AG bought a cargo from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc. Benchmark  gasoil  with 0.5 percent sulfur was
unchanged at $94.40 a barrel from yesterday.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the  regrade , rose to $1.25
a barrel today from $1.10 yesterday, Bloomberg data showed. A
wider spread indicates that jet fuel is more profitable to make
compared to gasoil.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude,  the crack spread , widened
to $13.06 a barrel from $12.92 yesterday.  The 16-month old contango in Dubai oil, the benchmark grade
of crude for Asia, has disappeared as a shortage of diesel in
China puts a premium on the quickest deliveries of fuel.  Glencore bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel from Shell at a
discount of 30 cents a barrel to benchmark quotes for loading
between Dec. 9 and Dec. 13, traders said.  Mercuria Energy Ltd. bought two cargoes of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil. It purchased 150,000 barrels from Vitol Group at
a discount of 15 cents a barrel to benchmark quotes for loading
between Dec. 9 and Dec. 13. Mercuria bought another 150,000-
barrel cargo from Total SA at a discount of 20 cents a barrel to
benchmark quotes for loading Dec. 20 to Dec. 24.  Fuel Oil  The Asian fuel oil crack spread, a measure of profit from
turning crude into the fuel, gained for a second day. Benchmark
180-centistoke fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed to
$6.42 a barrel today from $6.98 yesterday, Bloomberg data
showed.  Benchmark  180-centistoke fuel oil  rose 0.6 percent to
$483.25 a ton, while the price of  380-centistoke fuel oil ,
mainly used as marine fuel, gained 0.7 percent to $474 a ton.  Refinery News  PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state oil and gas company, said
its Balongan refinery is operating normally. A pumping unit was
repaired yesterday and output was unaffected as another pump was
used, spokesman Mochamad Harun said today. Pertamina has “no
plans” to shut down the residual fluid catalytic cracking unit,
Harun said.  ICIS, a chemical newsletter, earlier reported that
Pertamina plans to shut a gasoline-making unit at Balongan today
because of technical problems, citing an unidentified company
official.  To contact the reporters on this story:
