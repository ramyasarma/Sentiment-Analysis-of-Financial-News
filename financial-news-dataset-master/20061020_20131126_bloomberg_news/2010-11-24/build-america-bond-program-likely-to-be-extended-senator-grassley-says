The Build America Bond program,
which provides federal subsidies to state and local governments
borrowing for construction projects, is likely to be extended
for another year, said a spokeswoman for Senator  Charles Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.  A bill pending in the Senate would extend the securities,
known as BABs, through 2011 while paring back the subsidy to 32
percent of the interest cost from 35 percent. The bill also
includes the extension of numerous tax breaks.  Grassley predicts the program will be extended “given that
BABs is likely to travel with a lot of popular tax provisions,”
Beth Pellett Levine, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Republican, said
today. Also, “BABs has a lot of support among key Democrats in
Congress.”  The BABs program, due to expire at the end of the year, was
created under President  Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus
program. More than $169 billion of the taxable securities have
been sold since the first issue in April 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Senator Grassley’s comments were reported earlier today in
the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
