Cameco Corp. , the world’s second-
largest uranium producer, agreed to supply the fuel to China
Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Co. through 2025 to meet rising
demand in the world’s fastest-growing nuclear market.  Cameco plans to sell 29 million pounds of uranium
concentrate to China Guangdong Nuclear, subject to the approval
of the Chinese government, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
company said in a statement yesterday. That’s equivalent to
about 13,000 metric tons.  China and India are leading the biggest atomic expansion
since the decade after the 1970s oil crisis to cut pollution and
power economies. Chinese uranium demand may rise to 20,000 tons
annually by 2020, more than a third of the 50,572 tons mined
globally last year, according to the  World Nuclear Association .  The nation may purchase about 5,000 tons this year, more
than twice as much as it consumes, to build stockpiles for new
reactors,  Thomas Neff , a physicist and uranium-industry analyst
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in July.
Loading a new reactor requires about 400 tons of uranium to
start, he said.  “China Guangdong Nuclear Power has 14 nuclear power units
currently under construction and is commencing preliminary work
on another nine units,” Cameco Chief Executive Officer  Jerry Grandey  said in the statement.  The country’s largest reactor operator after China National
Nuclear Corp. is building about 17 gigawatts of reactors, and by
2020, expects to have more than 50 gigawatts in operation,
according to Cameco.  Hu Guangyao, the Shenzhen-based spokesman of China
Guangdong Nuclear, didn’t pick up phone calls to his office
seeking comment.  The supply agreement follows the signing of an initial
accord with the Chinese atomic plant builder on June 24. Cameco
didn’t specify the value of the contract.  -- Wang Ying . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
