The euro strengthened against the
dollar and the yen as technical indicators showed the common
currency’s decline yesterday was excessive.  The euro gained for the first time in three days versus the
dollar as its 14-day stochastic oscillator chart declined to
around 5 today, below the level of 20 that signals the currency
is poised to strengthen. South Korea’s won slumped to an 11-week
low after North Korea yesterday fired artillery shells at an
island in South Korea, killing two soldiers.  “The single currency’s slide yesterday was sharp and it
looks oversold,” said  Lee Wai Tuck , a currency strategist at
Forecast Pte in Singapore. “We may see a bounce of the euro.”  Europe’s currency climbed to $1.3393 as of 9:52 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3367 in New York yesterday, when it dropped 1.9
percent, the biggest decline since Aug. 11. The euro advanced to
111.69 yen from 111.16 yen. The dollar traded at 83.33 yen from
83.16 yen.  The won tumbled 1.4 percent to 1,153.30 per dollar, after
weakening to 1,172.50, the lowest since Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
