Central Japan Railway Co., parent of
Japan’s biggest bullet-train maker, said it will take as long as
three decades to pay for its planned magnetic-levitation line.  The railroad expects to begin operating a 43 kilometer (27
mile) piece of its Tokyo-Nagoya maglev services for paying
customers sometime after 2013, Chairman  Yoshiyuki Kasai  told
reporters in Tokyo today, without giving more details on the
timeframe. A maglev system uses magnetic power to propel trains
that float above the track.  Kasai also said he expects the 5.1 trillion yen ($61
billion) maglev line, combined with bullet-train service, to be
profitable in 2027, its first year of operation. He said it
would take between 25 and 30 years to repay the investment,
which Japan’s transportation ministry has said will probably
cost closer to 5.5 trillion yen.  U.S. Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  rode 502
kilometers-per-hour (312 mph) on a maglev train at JR Central’s
test track in May. The model has run at a world-record 581.7 kph,
according to the railroad. Kasai today said a maglev line
linking northeastern U.S. cities may be built before 2027. He
didn’t elaborate.  JR Central  fell 0.8 percent to 635,000 yen at the 3 p.m.
close Tokyo trading. It has gained 2.1 percent this year,
compared with a 4.9 percent slide in the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The company’s  Nippon Sharyo Ltd.  unit, Japan’s largest
maker of bullet trains, declined 0.8 percent to 386 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
