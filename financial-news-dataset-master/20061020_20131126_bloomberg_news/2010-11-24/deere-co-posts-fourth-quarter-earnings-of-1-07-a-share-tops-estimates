Deere & Co.,  the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings
that topped analysts’ estimates as sales to U.S. farmers rose.  Net income  of $457.2 million, or $1.07 a share, in the
three months through October, compared with a net loss of $222.8
million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Moline, Illinois-based
Deere said today in a statement. That beat the 97-cent  average
estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Deere, led by Chief Executive Officer  Samuel Allen , is
selling more combines and tractors to U.S. farmers as corn,
soybean, wheat and cotton prices climb.  “We see economics for row-crop farmers remaining very
constructive, which we believe bodes well for the demand for
high-horsepower tractors and combines,”  Meredith Taylor , a New
York-based analyst for Barclays Capital who  rates  the shares
“overweight,” said in a Nov. 22 report.  Sales rose 35 percent to $7.2 billion from $5.33 billion a
year earlier. The company today  forecast  fiscal 2011 net income
of $2.1 billion, equaling about $4.92 a share according to
Bloomberg calculations. Analysts in the Bloomberg survey
estimated net income of $2.3 billion, or $5.34 a share.  Deere  fell  $1.13, or 1.5 percent, to $75.21 at 7:07 a.m.
before the start of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.  The
shares  gained 41 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
