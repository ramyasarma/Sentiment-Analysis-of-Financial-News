Cattle futures extended a rally to a
26-month high and hogs climbed to a nine-week high on signs of
rising U.S. meat demand before year-end holidays.  In the wholesale market,  pork  jumped yesterday to the
highest since Oct. 18, and  choice beef  is up 15 percent from a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Meatpackers have processed 395,000 cattle this week, up 5.1
percent from a year earlier, agency data show.  “You start to see demand for ham increase as you go into
the Christmas holiday,” and processors tend to buy more cattle
before beef orders rise at this time of year, said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,
Iowa.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.375 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $1.056 a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.061,
the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 2, 2008.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement climbed 0.45
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.18275 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement gained 0.7 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 77.6 cents a pound. Earlier, the commodity reached
77.85 cents, the highest since Sept. 21.  U.S. markets will be closed tomorrow for the Thanksgiving
holiday.  Wholesale pork rose 1.6 percent yesterday to 79.12 cents a
pound. At midday, choice beef was $1.6118 a pound, up 1.2
percent from a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
