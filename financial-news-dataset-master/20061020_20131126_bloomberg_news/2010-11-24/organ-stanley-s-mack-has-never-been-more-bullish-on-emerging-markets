Morgan Stanley  Chairman  John Mack 
said he has “never been more bullish” on emerging markets,
adding that he’s “shocked” at how little investment is going
toward the assets, especially from the U.S.  “You see the amount of infrastructure that’s being put in
place in these countries,” Mack said, speaking at an event in
Mexico City. “When I look at portfolios, I’m shocked how little
money has been allocated on an asset-allocation basis to the new
markets.”  Mack said his view on emerging markets comes from recent
trips abroad to countries including China, and urged investors
to take similar trips.  The  MSCI Emerging Market  Index has climbed 28 percent since
May 25 in a six-month rally that has more than doubled returns
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the period, helped by fast
economic growth in countries such as Brazil and India.  Asked about Europe’s debt troubles, Mack said he’s still
willing to make investments tied to banks on the continent.  “I think some of the banks will come out of this very
strong,” Mack said. “I would be cautious in the smaller banks.
I’d be cautious in the U.K. But I think there are great
opportunities in some of these banks. It’s a risky trade.”  Ireland’s government is in talks with the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund on an aid package for the
country’s banks as part of a bid to contain Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
