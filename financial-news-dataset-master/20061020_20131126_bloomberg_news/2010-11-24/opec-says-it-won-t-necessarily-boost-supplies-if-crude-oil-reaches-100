Oil prices at $100 a barrel will
only trigger action from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries if they are accompanied by a supply shortage, the
group’s secretary-general said.  Consumers and producers are comfortable with prices at
about $78 a barrel,  Abdalla El-Badri  said in an interview in
London today. OPEC doesn’t expect oil to reach $100 this year,
he said. Futures for January delivery are around $81 a barrel in
New York. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch predict prices may rise to $100 in 2011.  OPEC, accountable for 40 percent of global supply, will
next meet to review production quotas on Dec. 11 in Quito,
Ecuador. The meeting will be “smooth” as the group needs to
comply with existing limits set in 2008 rather than devise a new
agreement, he said.  “If there is a physical shortage, I think OPEC will act,”
El-Badri said. “If there is a shortage because of speculation,
OPEC will not really act because no-one will really buy our
oil.”  No additional OPEC production would be needed if oil
inventories in developed countries remain above 53 days worth of
demand, El-Badri said. Stockpiles were equivalent to 59.9 days
of consumption in September, according to the  International
Energy Agency .  Crude is unlikely to rise as high as $100 a barrel this
year as unemployment and slow growth in the U.S. and Europe
curtail consumption, he said. Still, El-Badri said that prices
of $100 a barrel would not necessarily derail the global
recovery.  Compliance Slips  The organization’s compliance with its output target of
24.845 million barrels a day slipped to 51 percent last month,
according to a report from the group published on Nov. 11. The
11 OPEC members bound by allocations produced 26.89 million
barrels a day in October.  Iraq, the only member exempt from the quota system, is
unlikely to have any limit placed on its production before 2014
to 2015 as its economy recovers from decades of war, El-Badri
said.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
