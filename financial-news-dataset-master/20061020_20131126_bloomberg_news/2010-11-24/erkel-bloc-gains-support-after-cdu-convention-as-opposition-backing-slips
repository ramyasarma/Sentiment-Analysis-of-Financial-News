German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
bloc gained one percentage point to 34 percent support in the
week following her Christian Democratic Union’s party
convention, according to a Forsa poll for Hamburg-based Stern
magazine and broadcaster RTL.  Her coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, was
unchanged at 5 percent, the poll said.  Support for the opposition Social Democrats fell one point
to 22 percent, its weakest showing since March and tied with the
Green Party, whose support was unchanged. The Left Party lost
one point to 10 percent, according to the poll.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
