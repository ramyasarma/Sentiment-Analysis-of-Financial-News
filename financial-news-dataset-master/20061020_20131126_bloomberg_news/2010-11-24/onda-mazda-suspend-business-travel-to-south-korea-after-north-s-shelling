Honda Motor Co. ,  Mazda Motor Corp .
and  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.  suspended business travel to
South Korea, citing tensions after North Korea shelled its
southern neighbor.  “We halted business trips to the country for today,” said
Keitaro Yamamoto, a Tokyo-based spokesman at Honda. “We will
closely watch the situation and decide what we are going to do
from tomorrow.” Honda has an office in South Korea, and two
employees are working there, he said.  North Korea fired artillery shells yesterday at the South
Korean island of Yeonpyeong near the disputed border between the
two countries, killing two soldiers and setting houses ablaze in
the worst attack on its neighbor in at least eight months. Mazda
also halted business trip to Korea until the political situation
stabilizes, said  Sho Aoyama , a company spokesman.  Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Nissan Motor Co ., Japan’s largest
and third-largest automakers, said they haven’t suspended travel.
Toyota is following Japan’s foreign ministry’s safety alert
calling for caution and will keep a close watch on the situation,
said  Shiori Hashimoto , a Tokyo-based company spokeswoman.  Nissan sells cars in South Korea and hasn’t seen any impact
from the attack, said  Mitsuru Yonekawa , a Yokohama-based
spokesman for the automaker.  Honda fell 1.4 percent to 3,075 yen as of 2:49 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, while Mazda declined 2.1 percent. Toyota dropped
0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
