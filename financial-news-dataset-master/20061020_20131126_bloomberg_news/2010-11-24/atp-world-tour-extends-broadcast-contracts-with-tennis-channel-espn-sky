The  ATP World Tour  as extended
television deals with broadcasters including the Tennis Channel,
ESPN and Sky Sports starting in 2011.  “The increased exposure matches the growing demand around
the globe for men’s tennis and reflects the healthy growth in
the game,”  Adam Helfant , executive chairman and president of
the ATP World Tour, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The increased distribution will boost the ATP’s broadcast
revenue by more than half, the men’s tennis tour said, without
giving financial details.  The ATP extended a broadcast deal with Sky Sports in the
U.K. by three years, while it struck a five-year agreement with
the Tennis Channel in the U.S. It also announced a “multi-
year” deal with ESPN in the U.S, as well as a renewed three-
year agreement with ESPN International across Latin America and
a new three-year deal with ESPN in Australia.  Close to 45,000 hours of ATP World Tour coverage will be
available in more than 180 countries through the newly completed
broadcast agreements, the ATP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
