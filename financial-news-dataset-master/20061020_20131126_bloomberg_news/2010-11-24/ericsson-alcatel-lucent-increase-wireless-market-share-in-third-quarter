Ericsson AB  and  Alcatel-Lucent SA 
had the biggest market-share gains in the third quarter among
the top wireless network vendors, according to researcher
 Dell’Oro Group .  Huawei Technologies Co. remained the second-biggest vendor
after market leader Ericsson, the Redwood City, Calif.-based
market researchers said in a report. The market for wireless
equipment will grow about 5 percent next year, it said.  Worldwide revenue for wireless network equipment was $8.41
billion in the quarter, the researcher said. Ericsson, Huawei,
third-placed Nokia Siemens Networks, and fourth-placed Alcatel-
Lucent all gained market share as Nortel Networks Corp. assets
were sold off over the last year.  “Alcatel-Lucent has picked up market share every quarter
since the fourth quarter of 2009,” Stefan Pongratz, a Dell’Oro
analyst, said by e-mail.  Dell’Oro’s figures include radio access networks through
so-called fourth-generation technology, as well as mobile
switching centers and radio network controllers.  Sales of the fourth-generation technology called Long-Term
Evolution, designed to give higher broadband data download
speeds, should at least double next year, Pongratz said, adding
that the growth figure may not be meaningful at this early
stage. Dell’Oro plans to break out LTE figures for the first
time in its fourth-quarter report.  A competing fourth-generation technology called WiMax
accounted for $238 million in revenue in the quarter, with
Samsung Electronics Co. having the highest sales, Dell’Oro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
