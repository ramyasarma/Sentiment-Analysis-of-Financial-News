Sugar rose for a third day on
concern supplies from India, the world’s second-biggest
producer, and Australia, the third-largest exporter, will be
limited. Coffee and cocoa declined.  Shipments from  Queensland Sugar  Ltd., which handles more
than 90 percent of Australia’s exports, may drop 14 percent for
the year ending June 30 from the previous year, said  Neil Taylor , the Brisbane-based company’s chief executive officer.
India will be “cautious” on ending export limits to ensure
adequate domestic supplies, K.V. Thomas, a junior farm minister,
said Nov. 15.  “The fundamental news continues to be supportive of the
tightness to come,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president
at Newedge USA, wrote in a report today. People are concerned
about India’s exports, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery added 0.62 cent, or 2.3
percent, to settle at 27.95 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, extending this week’s gain to 6.9
percent. U.S. markets will be closed tomorrow for the 
Thanksgiving holiday.  “Nobody is sure about the timing and the extent of the
Indian exports -- it is a big unknown,”  Emmanuel Jayet , the
head of agricultural commodity research at Societe Generale SA
in London, said today by telephone. “We have expectations of
exports between 2 and 3.5 million tons.”  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery added
$28.70, or 4.2 percent, to $709.70 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Robusta-coffee futures for March delivery fell $17, or 0.9
percent, to $1,851 a ton on NYSE Liffe. In New York, Arabica-
coffee futures for March delivery declined 3.1 cents, or 1.5
percent, at $2.0745 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery lost $11, or 0.4 percent,
to $2,793 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures for March
delivery rose 2 pounds, or 0.1 percent, to 1,862 pounds ($2,937)
a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
