Stephen Bosworth, U.S. envoy on
North Korea, called on Kim Jong Il’s government to honor its
commitment to making the Korean peninsula free of nuclear
weapons.  Bosworth made the comment to reporters today in Beijing. He
said the U.S. stands behind its ally South Korea in opposing
North Korean aggression.  North Korea yesterday shelled a South Korean island close
to a disputed sea border, killing two soldiers and setting
houses ablaze.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
