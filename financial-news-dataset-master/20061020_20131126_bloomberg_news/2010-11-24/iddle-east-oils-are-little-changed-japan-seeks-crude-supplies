Middle East crude oils for sale to
Asia were little changed at premiums to their benchmarks as

requirements.  Murban , produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for January
loading was at a premium of 57 cents a barrel to its official
selling price, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Lower Zakum,
also produced in the emirate, was at a premium of 51 cents.  Japan Oil, Gas & Metals National Corp., the trade
ministry’s agency, is seeking to buy 1.9 million barrels, or
300,000 kiloliters, of Middle East light crude oil for delivery
between December and March, the company said on its website
today. Bids are opening for the cargoes on Dec. 3.  Demand for January cargoes rose on a surge in distillate-
rich crude purchases on signs China was facing a shortage of
diesel. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a Persian Gulf benchmark for
Asia, increased 12 cents today to $13.10 a barrel after reaching
$14.32 on Nov. 15.  Oman  crude for immediate loading decreased 29 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $81.48 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.  Dubai

barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:01 p.m. Singapore
