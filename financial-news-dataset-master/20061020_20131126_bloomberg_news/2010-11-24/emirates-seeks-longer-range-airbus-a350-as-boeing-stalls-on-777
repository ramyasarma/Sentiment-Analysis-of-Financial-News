Emirates, the world’s biggest
airline by international traffic, urged  Airbus SAS  to boost the
range of the biggest version of its new A350 wide-body plane as
Boeing Co. ponders a redesign of the competing 777 model.  Emirates, whose outstanding orders for the 777 will make it
the twin-jet’s biggest user, needs higher-capacity aircraft for
its longest intercontinental routes,  Tim Clark , the Dubai-based
airline’s president, said today in an interview in Paris.  Clark has ordered 20 350-seat A350-1000s, a model he says
can’t reach Los Angeles from Dubai in the three-class layout
that Emirates prefers. The  Boeing  planes that it currently uses
on the route are based on a less efficient 20-year-old design,
with the 354-seat 777-300ER at the limits of its range, curbing
the payload, and the 777-200LR limited to 266 people.  “We’re finding that the smallest aircraft that’s useful to
us needs to be 340 seats,” Clark said. “We’re trying to
persuade Airbus to realign the A350-1000 more toward the ER,
increasing both its capacity and its range.”  With the A350-1000 still undergoing development and not due
for delivery to Emirates until 2015, Toulouse, France-based
Airbus may still be able to reconfigure elements of the design.
Airbus spokesman  Stefan Schaffrath  declined to comment today.  Emirates has ordered a total of 70 A350s, including 50 of
the -900 variant, which can fly 200 miles further than the -1000
but which carries only 300 people in the three-class
configuration. The biggest Arab airline also has options on an
additional 50 A350s and signed a letter of intent firming up 30
of those in 2008.  777 Revamp  Clark said Emirates is equally interested in a new 777 if
Boeing revamps the model enough to deliver significant savings.  With its 787 Dreamliner yet to enter service, Boeing plans
to decide next year whether to commit to a full redesign for the
777 or build a new wing to boost performance, something the
Chicago-based manufacturer began discussing in June 2009.  “We would like to see an aircraft that’s lighter, with or
without composites, and more fuel efficient,” Clark said,
adding that the plane would need to fly from Dubai to Los
Angeles in 16 1/2 hours with a payload of 35 to 40 metric tons,
compared with a maximum 30 tons today. “It’s a big ask. In the
end they’ll come up with something, but I doubt they’ll quite
achieve that.”  ‘Room for Both’  Clark said Emirates may place more orders for both the A350
and the 777 for use on its longest routes if the competing
aircraft are developed to its satisfaction.  “There’s room for both planes, quite frankly,” he said.  For Boeing, a revamped or all-new 777 would fill a gap in
its  lineup  above the 290-seat Dreamliner. Emirates has about 90
777s in operation or on order, making it the model’s top user.  Boeing is regularly seeking the input of Emirates and other
customers and has the time “to make the right product
decisions” that are aligned with available technologies and
airlines’ needs, said  Jim Proulx , a spokesman in Seattle, home
to the company’s commercial headquarters.  “We are committed to maintaining our leadership in this
segment and providing customers a product offering to do that
for another 20 years or longer, whether it is a 777 derivative
or possible new airplane,” Proulx said.  Airbus’s A380 superjumbo may also feature in Emirates’
reckoning on very-long-haul flights as the aircraft’s weight is
gradually reduced, Clark said. The Dubai-Los Angeles route is
within the model’s range, according to the Airbus Website.  Emirates will introduce the A380 to Tokyo’s Narita airport
as soon as next September, when it begins taking the next batch
of six to nine jets, due for delivery through March 2012, the
CEO said. That will take the fleet to between 21 and 24 planes.  Bookings remain “very strong” on routes already served by
the A380 and show no sign of suffering from the Nov. 4 engine
blowout on a  Qantas Airways Ltd.  plane powered by Rolls-Royce
Group Plc turbines. Emirates’ superjumbos are equipped with
engines from a General Electric Co.-Pratt & Whitney venture.  To contact the reporters on this story:
