South Korean consumer confidence
rebounded from a 16-month low on expectations that the sustained
economic recovery will boost household income and job prospects.  The  sentiment index  rose to 110 from 108 in October, the
Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement in Seoul today. The
poll was conducted before North Korea lobbed shells at a South
Korean island on Nov. 23, which sent the won to a two-month low.
A number exceeding 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  “We don’t know how much the incident will hurt consumer
sentiment yet,” Jang Wan Sub, a senior economist at the
Bank of Korea, said before the release. At the same time, “given
the previous case with the sinking of a warship early this year,
I don’t expect any big impact in December poll.”  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo last week raised its
benchmark interest rate to 2.5 percent, the second increase this
year, to curb inflation that reached a 20-month high in October.
He said he expects the economy to expand 6 percent this year and
then slow down to around 4.5 percent next year.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook rose to 108 in November from 104 in October, while the
expected inflation rate over the next year declined to 3.2
percent from 3.4 percent.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,138 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between Nov. 12 and Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
