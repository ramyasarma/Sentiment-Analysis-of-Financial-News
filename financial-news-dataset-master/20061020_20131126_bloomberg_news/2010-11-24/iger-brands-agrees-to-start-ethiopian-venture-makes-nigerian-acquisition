Tiger Brands Ltd. , South Africa’s
largest food company, formed a venture in Ethiopia and agreed to
buy biscuit-maker Deli Foods Nigeria Ltd. to diversify earnings
away from its home market.  Tiger Brands “is currently pursuing other opportunities on
the continent,” the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. The deals will generate a combined turnover of
almost 500 million rand ($70.5 million) in the first year.  Tiger Brands is following other South African companies
expanding in faster-growing African markets, including  Standard
Bank Group Ltd.  and retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd., to
compensate for slower domestic growth. Tiger Brands, which makes
most of its sales in South Africa, expects trading conditions in
Africa’s biggest economy to remain challenging in the six months
through March, it said.  Tiger Brands today  reported  a 12 percent fall in net income
to 2.19 billion rand in its fiscal full-year through September
while sales fell 2 percent to 19.3 billion rand.  Earnings were affected by “significant price deflation in
food commodities and a weaker trading environment,” it said.  Tiger Brands  rose  2.47 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 186.47 rand
as of 9:05 a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the company at about 35
billion rand. The company’s total dividend and capital
distribution for the fiscal year increased 6 percent to 7.46
rand a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
