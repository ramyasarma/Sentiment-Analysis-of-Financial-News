South African inflation accelerated
in October for the first time in 10 months on an increase in
transportation costs, while remaining in the bottom half of the
target range.  The  inflation  rate rose to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent in
September, the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its
 website  today. The  median estimate  of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 3.3 percent. Prices rose 0.2 percent in the month.  The rand has climbed 5 percent against the dollar this
year, extending last year’s 28 percent gain, helping to reduce
the cost of imports and keeping inflation within the Reserve
Bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range. That allowed the
bank to cut its key interest  rate  to 5.5 percent on Nov. 18, the
ninth reduction in 21 months, to help spur  economic growth .  “With inflation still well below the mid-point of the
inflation target range and likely to remain on average below the
mid-point in 2011, and job losses ongoing, there is scope for
another interest rate cut,”  Annabel Bishop , an economist at
Investec Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments.  Transportation costs increased an annual 1.8 percent in
October, and 0.8 percent in the month, as vehicle prices climbed
1.4 percent and the cost of gasoline rose by 4 cents a liter,
the statistics agency said. Food and non-alcoholic beverage
prices fell an annual 1 percent.  Market Reaction  South Africa’s benchmark government bond maintained an
earlier drop after the release of the inflation data. The 13.5
percent security due 2015 fell to 125.58 rand by noon in
Johannesburg from a close of 125.69 yesterday. The yield rose 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.1 percent.  The rand traded at 7.1177, little changed from before the
release of the inflation data and down from 7.1075 late
yesterday.  The central bank said on Nov. 18 that it expects inflation
to average 4.3 percent this year and next, and 4.8 percent in
2012.  “The outlook for domestic inflation has improved further
against the backdrop of a continued negative domestic output gap
and sustained strength in the exchange rate,” central bank
Governor  Gill Marcus  said on Nov. 18.  In its new growth strategy released yesterday, the
government said the central bank should continue to target “low
and stable inflation” while doing more to support a competitive
exchange rate, including stepping up foreign currency purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
