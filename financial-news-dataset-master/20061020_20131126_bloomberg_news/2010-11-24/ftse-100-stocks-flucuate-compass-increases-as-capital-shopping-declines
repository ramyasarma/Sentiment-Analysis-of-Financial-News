U.K. stocks advanced, stopping a
three-day slide for the FTSE 100 Index, after reports that
showed U.S. consumer spending picked up in October and jobless
claims declined to the lowest level since July 2008 last week.  Mining shares rallied as copper and zinc pared three days
of losses. Compass Group Plc gained 7.3 percent after the
world’s largest catering company reported earnings that topped
estimates. Bank of Ireland Plc dropped 11 percent, extending its
decline this week to 44 percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  gained 1.4 percent to 5,657.1 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge retreated for two
consecutive days this week as investors speculated that the
bailout for Ireland’s banks won’t stop the sovereign-debt crisis
from infecting other European economies and as North Korea
shelled a South Korean island. The  FTSE All-Share Index  added
1.3 percent, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  increased 0.5 percent.  “It seems far too easy to cast the European debt doubts
aside, as buyers come back bullish to the equity markets on
broadly positive economic data from Europe and the U.S.,”
 Daniel Weston , Munich-based portfolio adviser at Schroeder
Equities GmbH, said.  In the U.S.,  jobless claims  declined by 34,000 to 407,000
in the week ended Nov. 20, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The  median projection  of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000. The total number of
people receiving unemployment insurance decreased to the lowest
in two years, and the number on extended payments also fell.  Household Purchases  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.3
percent gain in September that was larger than previously
estimated, according to Commerce Department figures. Incomes
climbed 0.5 percent and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred
measure of inflation was little changed, capping the smallest
12-month gain since records began five decades ago.  U.K. gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent from the
previous three months, when it increased 1.2 percent, the Office
for National Statistics said today in London. That matched an
initial estimate on Aug. 26 and the  median forecast  of 30
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Exports rose 2.2 percent
after a 2.3 percent increase in the previous three months.  Irish Deficit Cutting  Ireland’s Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  will cut spending
by about a fifth and raise taxes over the next four years as
talks to bail out the country near their conclusion.  The government plans to cut welfare by about 2.8 billion
euros ($3.7 billion) and increase income tax by 1.9 billion
euros to narrow the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of gross
domestic product by the end of 2014. Ireland will have a budget
shortfall of 12 percent of GDP this year, or 32 percent
including the banking rescue.  Antofagasta Plc gained 4.3 percent to 1,373 pence,
rebounding after the company declined more than 4 percent
yesterday. Base metals rose on the London Metal Exchange,
benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar.  Kazakhmys Plc climbed 4.2 percent to 1,449 pence as the
copper producer was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at
Exane BNP Paribas.  Compass advanced 7.3 percent to 566 pence after the
catering company said full-year profit rose 15 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates, as it exited some unprofitable contracts
and cut costs at acquired businesses.  Provident Financial Plc jumped 8.6 percent to 841.5 pence,
the largest climb since February 2009, as the U.K.’s biggest
subprime lender said the government’s spending cuts will have a
“modest” effect on its customers.  Bank of Ireland Plunges  Bank of Ireland  sank 11 percent to 26.7 euro cents after
two people familiar with the situation said that the Dublin-
based lender may end up in majority state control as the
government injects more capital into the bank.  Ireland’s government will seek to raise the core tier 1
capital levels of its banks to 10.5 percent to 12 percent, the
people said. The people didn’t want to be identified because the
plan hasn’t been completed.  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc lost 5.1 percent to
337.4 pence, a fifth retreat for the longest streak of declines
since August. The U.K.’s largest mall owner said it’s in talks
to buy the Trafford Centre near Manchester for about 750 million
pounds ($1.2 billion) in stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
