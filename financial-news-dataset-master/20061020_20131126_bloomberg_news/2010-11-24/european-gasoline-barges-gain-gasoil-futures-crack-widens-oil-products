European  gasoline  barge prices rose
as crude advanced. Gasoil’s crack, or difference between the
fuel and Brent, widened for a second day to the highest level in
a week.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a jet fuel barge from Air
France-KLM Group. Shell also purchased a naphtha cargo.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $752 and $760 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals
yesterday from $735 to $745 a ton.  Shell bought the 3,000 tons that changed hands from
Glencore International AG and Gunvor International Ltd. The
trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished automotive fuel.  Brent crude for January rose as much as 3.1 percent to
$85.83 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Gasoline’s crack expanded to $4.90 a barrel, compared with
$4.05 yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker in London.  Gunvor bought a 12,500-ton cargo of naphtha from Glencore
at $775 a ton, priced for delivery to Rotterdam from Dec. 15 to
Dec. 19, according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring
the Platts pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London.
Shell purchased a cargo for $776 a ton from Vilma Oil SL, priced
for delivery from Dec. 13 to Dec. 17, the survey showed.  Naphtha’s crack widened to $1.70 from $1 yesterday,
according to PVM. Naphtha is used in gasoline and petrochemical
production.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought 2,000 tons of jet fuel at a premium of $59 a
ton to December ICE gasoil for loading from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5 in
the ARA oil-trading hub, the survey of Platts showed. That’s in
line with yesterday’s trade.  Gasoil for December increased 3.4 percent to $723.25 a ton
on the ICE exchange. That compares with $699.75 yesterday. The
fuel for January delivery also gained 3.3 percent to $728.25 a
ton, compared with $705 yesterday.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, climbed to
$12.04 a barrel, the highest premium since Nov. 17, ICE data
show. That compares with $11.38 yesterday.  Gasoil barges traded at a discount of $5 to $6 a ton to
December ICE gasoil, according to the Platts survey.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel traded at premiums of $21 and $22 a
ton to the gasoil futures contract, the survey showed.  Refinery News  Three workers were killed when toxic gas leaked from the
Haifa, Israel, processing plant of Oil Refineries Ltd., the
country’s biggest refiner, Israeli police said today.  The facility “has been closed down for seasonal
maintenance during the past month,” the company said separately
in a statement. “As part of this operation the workers went up
on the gas facility in appropriate dress, including masks. For
reasons that are unclear at this moment, they were injured from
gas inhalation.”  Portugal’s Galp Energia SGPS SA said its refineries are
operating normally amid a general strike in the country today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
