Facebook Inc., operator of the
world’s biggest social-networking website, was sued for patent
infringement by a company controlled by  Jay S. Walker , a co-
inventor of Priceline.com.  Walker Digital LLC, accused Palo Alto, California-based
Facebook of misappropriating an invention that helps computer
users establish anonymous communications.  “We believe this suit is completely frivolous and we will
fight it vigorously,” Facebook spokesman  Andrew Noyes  said in
an e-mail.  The complaint claims that three of Walker Digital’s
employees invented a system that allows users to more
effectively manage and control the release of personal
information.  Jay Walker  is the chairman of Stamford, Connecticut-based
Walker Digital and helped create the software behind
 Priceline.com , the online travel agency, according to his
biography.  The case is Walker Digital LLC v. Facebook Inc., U.S.
District Court, 10cv1026, District of Delaware (Wilmington). To
see the patent: 5,884,271.  To contact the reporters on this story:
