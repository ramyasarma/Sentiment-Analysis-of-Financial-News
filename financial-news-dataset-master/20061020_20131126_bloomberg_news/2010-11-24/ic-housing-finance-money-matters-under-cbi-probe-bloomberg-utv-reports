LIC Housing Finance Ltd.  and Money
Matters Financial Services Ltd. are being probed by India’s
Central Bureau of Investigation, Bloomberg UTV reported today,
citing people it didn’t identify.  The two companies are under investigation for certain
investments and placements, the television channel said. The
state agency will hold a press briefing at 4 p.m. today, it said.
Shares of both companies plummeted in Mumbai trading.  R.R. Nair , chief executive officer of Mumbai-based LIC
Housing Finance, and spokesman Sudipto Sil weren’t available for
comment.  Rajesh Sharma , chairman and managing director of  Money
Matters , and P. Kandaswamy, CBI joint director in Mumbai, also
couldn’t be reached.  The CBI is investigating loans that were given to a builder
without proper documentation, and money that was misappropriated,
Bloomberg UTV reported, without providing details. Some LIC
Housing executives have been questioned, and raids were
conducted around the country, it said.  Shares of LIC Housing dropped a record 18 percent to
1,070.2 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai.
