Tiffany & Co. , the world’s second-
largest luxury jewelry retailer, raised its full-year earnings
forecast after third-quarter profit rose 27 percent, helped by
new stores and sales of handbags.  Profit excluding some items this year will rise to as much
as $2.77 a share from $2.12 a year ago, New York-based Tiffany
said today in a statement. Analysts estimated $2.64, on average.
The shares rose to a record.  The jeweler, led by Chief Executive Officer  Michael Kowalski , introduced its first handbag collection in 20 years in
September to extend the Tiffany brand. Other new accessories
include men’s briefcases, purses, wallets and business-card
holders. The company operated 225 stores at the end of the third
quarter, 10 more than last year, with six being added in the
Asia-Pacific region.  Tiffany  rose  $2.54, or 4.4 percent, to $60.81 at 10:25 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after reaching
$61.30, the highest level since the share were sold to the
public in May 1987. Tiffany had  gained  36 percent this year
before today.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA , the world’s largest
jewelry maker, had gained 53 percent before today in Zurich
trading.  Net Income at Tiffany advanced to $55.1 million, or 43
cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 31, from $43.3
million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, according to the
statement. Excluding costs related to the relocation of
headquarter employees, profit was 46 cents. Analysts projected
36 cents, the average of estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Stellar Spender’  Revenue  jumped 14 percent to $681.7 million, exceeding the
$652.5 million average of estimates. Stock market gains have
helped improve confidence among luxury consumers, who will be
the “stellar spender” this holiday season, according to
 Michael P. Niemira , chief economist at the  International Council
of Shopping Centers .  Sales in the Americas, which make up more than half of
Tiffany’s total, rose 9 percent. In Europe, sales gained 22
percent, while in the Asia-Pacific region they increased 24
percent.  Tiffany has “hiked prices to counteract the rise in
commodities with no apparent detriment to consumer demand,”
 Brian Sozzi , a New York-based analyst for Wall Street Strategies
Inc., wrote in a note today.  Sales at all luxury stores open more than a year will
increase as much as 8 percent in November and December from a
year ago, according to the ICSC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
