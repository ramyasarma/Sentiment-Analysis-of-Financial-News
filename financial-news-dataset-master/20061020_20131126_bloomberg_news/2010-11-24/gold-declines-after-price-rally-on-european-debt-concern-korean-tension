Gold fluctuated in New York as
concerns about Europe’s debt crisis and escalating tensions
between North and South Korea boosted demand for a protection of
wealth.  Ireland had its long-term sovereign rating cut two steps to
A from AA- by Standard & Poor’s, which cited concern about
borrowing by the government as the nation seeks aid from the
International Monetary Fund and European Union. The United
Nations called for talks with North Korea over its shelling of a
South Korean island. German business confidence unexpectedly
rose to a record high in November.  “Support may continue to be offered by concerns over North
and South Korea, worries over European sovereign debt,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at  MF  Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said
in a report. “Pressure will come from stronger economic data.”  Gold futures for February delivery lost $1.90, or 0.1
percent, to $1,377.80 an ounce at 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices swung between a gain of 0.2 percent and a loss of
0.5 percent. The metal for immediate delivery in London was
little changed at $1,376.20.  Bullion was little changed at $1,376.25 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from $1,377.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  North Korea yesterday fired artillery shells at the South
Korean island of Yeonpyeong near the disputed border between the
two countries, killing two soldiers and two civilians and
setting houses ablaze.  ‘Threatening’ Peace  The UN Command proposed to North Korea’s military talks
between senior officers over the shelling, adding in an e-mailed
statement that it will investigate the incident. UN Commander
 Walter Sharp , who is also chief commander of the U.S. forces in
South Korea, condemned North Korea’s attack as “threatening to
the peace and stability of the entire region.”  Ireland’s Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  will today lay out
a four-year deficit-cutting program as the government races to
finish talks on aid with the IMF and the European Union. Irish
bonds fell today, and Spanish and Greek debt also declined.  “The growing realization that the risk of contagion is
real and not going away anytime soon is leading to sustained
safe-haven demand,” analysts at brokerage GoldCore Ltd. in
Dublin said today in a report.  Still, the Munich-based Ifo institute said its business
climate index rose to 109.3, the highest level since records for
a reunified Germany began in 1991. Economists predicted a drop
to 107.5. Government reports due today may show consumer
spending and orders for durable goods in the U.S. rose last
month, according to economists’ forecasts.  ETP Holdings  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products were little changed
at 2,084.48 metric tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. Silver holdings gained 51.7 tons to 14,930.3
tons, the highest amount since at least February, data from four
providers show.  Silver for March delivery in New York lost 0.6 percent to
$27.475 an ounce. It reached a 30-year high of $29.34 on Nov. 9
and is up 63 percent this year. Platinum for January delivery
was 0.5 percent higher at $1,666.10 an ounce.  Palladium for March delivery added 0.1 percent to $693.20
an ounce. The metal will be in an increasing shortage in the
coming years and prices may climb to $1,000 by 2014, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc said today in a report. The shortage may
come from higher autocatalyst demand and in part from falling
Russian state stockpiles of the metal, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
