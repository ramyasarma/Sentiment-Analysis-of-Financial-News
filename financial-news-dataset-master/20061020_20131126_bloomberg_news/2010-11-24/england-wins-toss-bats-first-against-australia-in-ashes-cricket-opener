England captain Andrew Strauss won
the toss and elected to bat first in the series-opening Ashes
cricket Test in Brisbane.  While England holds the Ashes following last year’s 2-1
triumph in the U.K., its last series victory on Australian soil
was in 1986-87.  The match will begin in overcast conditions at the Gabba,
where Australia is unbeaten in 21 matches going back to 1988.
Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology forecasts a shower or two in
Brisbane today.  Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Shane Watson, Simon
Katich, Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey, Marcus North, Brad Haddin,
Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Xavier Doherty, Ben Hilfenhaus.  England: Andrew Strauss (captain), Alastair Cook, Jonathan
Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood, Ian Bell, Matt Prior,
Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Steve Finn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
