Japan’s 10-year government bonds
will rally, pushing  yields  to the lowest in almost two weeks, as
losses in securities over the past month were too rapid,
according to Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co.  Benchmark  yields  may fall back below 1 percent after
reaching a two-month high this week, said  Tokuyoshi Takano , a
financial-derivatives manager in Tokyo at the unit of Japan’s
second-largest banking group. The 14-day relative strength index
for 10-year yields was 70.5 on Nov. 18, when the rates climbed
above 1.1 percent for the first time since September. Readings
above 70 suggest yields will decline.  “The recent yield gains have been rapid and seem to have
been overdone,” Takano said. “It wouldn’t be surprising if
yields fell back below 1 percent to the 0.8 percent level.”  Yields have reached their near-term peak by climbing above
1.1 percent on Nov. 18, and the rising trend that began when
rates were at 0.84 percent on Oct. 6 may halt, Takano said.
Benchmark yields were at 1.115 percent as of 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo.  The relative strength index has signaled reversal points
over the past three months. The index rose to 68.9 on Sept. 6,
when yields touched 1.195 percent, the highest level since June,
before falling the next day. The index dropped to 29.6 on Oct. 6,
when yields bottomed at a seven-year low of 0.82 percent.  A relative strength index measures the momentum behind
price swings. Traders use it to anticipate whether a trend is
coming to end and whether conditions are overbought or oversold.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
