GrainCorp Ltd. , eastern Australia’s
largest grain handler, reported a 27 percent increase in full-
year profit after buying a malt business last year.  Net income was A$80.2 million ($79 million) in the 12
months ended Sept. 30 from A$63.2 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said today in a statement.  GrainCorp last November completed the $655 million purchase
of United Malt Holdings Ltd., the world’s fourth-largest maker
of malt used for whisky and beer, to diversify earnings. The
company has more than 20 million tons of grain storage capacity
and its elevators handle as much as 80 percent of bulk grain
exports from eastern Australia, according to its  website .  “The 2010 result validates the strategy of income
diversification undertaken by the company,” Chief Executive
Officer  Alison Watkins  said in a statement. There will be
pressure on malt earnings in the current year as the market was
affected by consumer spending levels and foreign exchange rate
fluctuations, she said.  GrainCorp  rose  1.6 percent to A$7.85 on the Australian
stock exchange at 10:20 a.m. Sydney time, taking this year’s
gain to 27 percent.  The current harvest was about three to four weeks late
because of wet weather and the 3.2 million tons of wheat,
barley, canola and pulses delivered into the company’s network
so far was less than normally expected, Watkins said.  Harvest Delays  “There has been some speculation about the effect rain is
having on grain quality,” she said. “Some grain has been
affected but harvest delays mean it is too early to make broad
quality generalizations.”  The outlook for Australian grain exports for 2011 “remains
positive” even as the local currency traded at record levels,
she said.  The company received 7.4 million tons of grain in the year
ended Sept. 30, compared with 9.6 million tons in the previous
period and handled 3.5 million tons of exports compared with 5.2
million tons a year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
