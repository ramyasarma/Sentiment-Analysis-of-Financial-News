South Africa’s benchmark government
bond declined the most in eight weeks, raising the yield to the
highest in four weeks, after a report showed annual inflation
accelerated by more than estimated in October.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 fell 54 cents
to 125.16 rand by 3:28 p.m. in Johannesburg from a close of
125.69 yesterday. The yield rose 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 7.2 percent, the highest since Oct. 27.  Inflation  quickened  to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent in
September, the statistics office said today. The  median estimate 
of 21 economists was for a 3.3 percent increase in the inflation
rate, which is still near a five-year low.  “This is the  first time  inflation has worsened this
year,”  Neil Evans , the head of bond trading at  Nedbank Ltd. ,
said by phone from Johannesburg. “It’s very unlikely that we’ll
get more rate cuts next year” as inflation approaches the mid-
point of the central banks 3 percent to 6 percent target range,
he said.  The central bank reduced its  key interest rate  to 5.5
percent on Nov. 18, the ninth reduction in 21 months, to help
spur economic growth. The biggest economy in Africa  expanded  an
annualized 2.6 percent in the third quarter, the statistics
office said yesterday, as a 35 percent rally in the rand since
the start of 2009 and weak global demand led to a decline in
manufacturing. The expansion was smaller than the 3.3 percent
median estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Target  The government is targeting 7 percent annual growth over
the next two decades to boost jobs and cut poverty. The economy
shed 86,000 jobs in the third quarter, leaving the jobless rate
at 25.3 percent, the highest among countries tracked by
Bloomberg.  “Inflation came out marginally higher than expected in
October, which was a low survey month,”  Annabel Bishop , group
economist at Investec Ltd., said in an e-mailed note to clients
from Johannesburg today. “With inflation still well below the
mid-point of the inflation-target range and likely to remain on
average below the mid-point in 2011, and job losses ongoing,
there is scope for another interest-rate cut of 50 basis points
in the first quarter of 2011. However, its materialization will
depend heavily on the strength of the economy.”  The rand snapped three days of declines versus the dollar
after drifting between gains and losses as applications for
unemployment benefits in the U.S. fell more than forecast to the
lowest since July 2008, signaling improvement in the world’s
biggest economy.  The currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 7.0586 per dollar
from a close of 7.1075 yesterday.  Jobless claims  declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week
ended Nov. 20, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
