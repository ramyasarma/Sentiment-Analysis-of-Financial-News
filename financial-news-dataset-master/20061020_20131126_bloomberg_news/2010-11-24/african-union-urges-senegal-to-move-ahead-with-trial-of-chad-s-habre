(Corrects source of funding in second paragraph. The story
was published on Nov. 24.)  Senegal  should move ahead with the
war-crimes trial of  Hissene Habre , the former dictator of Chad,
despite a ruling by a regional court that he should be put
before an internationally sanctioned tribunal, the African Union
and European Union said.  The AU said it will contribute $1 million to the cost of
the trial, according to an e-mailed statement from the
organization today.  Senegal accepted a 2006 mandate from the AU to try Habre,
and revised its legal codes to allow what would be the first
war-crimes trial of a former African head of state by another
nation in Africa. The Economic Community of West African States’
Court of Justice ruled that Senegal can’t put Habre on trial, le
Soleil newspaper reported Nov. 19.  The ECOWAS decision “should not be ignored but should in
no way slow down or deflect the parties from their
commitments,” said Fernando Ponz, a representative of the
European Union, according to the  AU ’s statement, e-mailed to
reporters late yesterday.  Security forces under Habre, a former coup leader who was
backed by the U.S. and France in fighting with neighboring
Libya, orchestrated as many as 40,000 politically motivated
killings during his eight-year rule, according to a  1992 report 
by the country’s official truth commission, cited by Humand
Rights Watch. He has been living in Senegal under house arrest
since fleeing Chad in 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
