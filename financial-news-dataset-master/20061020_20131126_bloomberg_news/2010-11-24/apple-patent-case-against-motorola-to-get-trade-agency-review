Apple Inc. ’s patent claims
against  Motorola Inc.  will be reviewed by the U.S. International
Trade Commission, which could issue an order banning Motorola
phones from the U.S.  The ITC will determine if Motorola is infringing Apple
patents and whether it should rule to block U.S. imports of
Motorola phones made overseas that run on Google Inc.’s Android
operating system.  Notice  of the investigation was posted today
on the agency’s website.  Apple filed the complaint Oct 29 after Motorola filed its
own patent-infringement claims at the ITC in Washington on Oct.
6. The Apple complaint also names Motorola Mobility, which will
be spun off by Motorola next year. Additionally, Apple filed a
civil suit in October against Motorola in federal court in
Madison, Wisconsin.  The investigation adds to the cases pending before the ITC
over the technology behind the growing market for smartphones,
which can perform some of the functions of computers. Motorola
of Schaumburg, Illinois, also has patent fights at the ITC with
Microsoft Corp., while Cupertino, California-based Apple is in
fights with HTC Corp. and Nokia Oyj.  The quasi-judicial agency was set up to protect domestic
markets from unfair trade practices, and has the power to order
a ban on imports of products found to infringe U.S. patents.  The new case is In the Matter of Mobile Devices and Related
Software, 337-750, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
