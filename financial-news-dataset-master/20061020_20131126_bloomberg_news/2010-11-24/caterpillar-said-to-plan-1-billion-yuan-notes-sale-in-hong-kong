Caterpillar Inc ., the world’s
biggest maker of construction equipment, hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to help it sell yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The Peoria, Illinois-based company plans to raise as much
as 1 billion yuan ($150 million) from two-year bonds, said the
person, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.
Hong Kong-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman  Connie Ling  declined
to comment and Caterpillar spokesman  Jim Dugan  couldn’t be
reached outside normal U.S. business hours.  Caterpillar would be the second foreign company to sell
yuan bonds in the former British colony after McDonald’s Corp.
issued 200 million yuan of three-year notes in September,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
said in March it was considering bonds in yuan and United Co.
Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, said in September
that officials met bankers to learn about the market.  “There’s little doubt these deals will do well so long as
the borrower’s a reasonable name,”  Vijay Chander , Hong Kong-
based head of credit strategy at Standard Chartered Plc, said in
a phone interview. “Any kind of spread over the renminbi
deposit rate will attract a lot of investor interest,” he said,
referring to the yuan by its other name.  Global Trade  China is allowing greater use of its currency in global
trade to reduce reliance on the dollar, and opened the yuan bond
market in Hong Kong to overseas firms in February. The Ministry
of Finance announced plans to sell 8 billion yuan of securities
in the city on Nov. 30.  HSBC Holdings Plc, which controls two of the Kong Kong’s
three biggest banks, offers 0.71 percent interest on deposits of
500,000 yuan or less placed with it for 12 months.  “Most of the banks in Hong Kong have huge amounts of
renminbi deposits,” said  Chris Tang , a credit analyst with
China Construction Bank Corp. in Hong Kong. “There are little
channels to invest in and limited issuers.”  Yields on yuan bonds sold in Hong Kong have fallen this
month, with Bank of China Ltd.’s 1 billion yuan of 3.4 percent
notes due September 2011 declining the most with a drop of 31
basis points, according to Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Caterpillar has permission from Chinese authorities to
transfer proceeds from its yuan bonds to the mainland, the
Financial Times reported today, without saying where it got the
information. It will use the money to support a leasing unit,
the FT said.  ‘Winning’  Caterpillar will build a manufacturing plant in Tianjin to
increase its worldwide capacity for large-engine production, the
company said on Nov. 19. “Winning” in China is the top
priority, Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  said on a Nov.
15 call with analysts.  Investor demand for yuan-denominated bonds is strong, in
part on expectations the currency will continue to appreciate
against the dollar, according to Standard Chartered’s Chander.  Yuan deposits at Hong Kong banks more than doubled to a
record 149 billion yuan in the six months ended Sept. 30, Hong
Kong Monetary Authority data show, while the currency has risen
2.7 percent since a two-year dollar peg ended on June 19.  Hong Kong’s yuan bond market “is set to grow in leaps and
bounds, however the one critical missing ingredient at the
moment is domestic liquidity,” Chander said. “People tend to
buy and hold here, so there isn’t as much secondary market
trading as perhaps the market makers would like.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
