KWV Holdings Ltd. investors are
investigating ways of blocking a takeover bid from Pioneer Foods
Ltd., Sake24 reported, citing Danie de Wet, a former chairman of
KWV.  Investors, especially farmers holding KWV stock, are not
satisfied with a speculated offer price of 12 rand a share for
the company, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited De Wet as
saying. The investors are trying to get enough support to force
a special shareholders’ meeting, Sake24 said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
