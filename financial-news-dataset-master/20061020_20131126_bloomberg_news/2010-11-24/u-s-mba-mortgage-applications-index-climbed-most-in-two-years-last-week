The number of mortgage applications
in the U.S. rose last week as purchases increased by the most in
two years.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  rose 2.1 percent
in the week ended Nov. 19 after dropping 14 percent the prior
week, the biggest drop of the year, figures from the Washington-
based group showed today. The gauge of  purchases  surged 14.4
percent, the biggest gain since November 2008, while the
 refinancing  measure fell 1 percent.  Borrowing costs near a record low and reduced home prices
are helping to stabilize a market struggling to recover after
the April expiration of a government tax credit. A sustained
improvement in housing may take longer as  unemployment  hovers
close to 10 percent and foreclosures persist.  “The housing market takes one step forward but then one
half step back,”  Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic
Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania, said before the report. “The
level of sales remains quite pathetic.”  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan fell to
78.6 percent last week from 80.3 percent the prior week, today’s
figures showed.  The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage loan increased
to 4.50 percent from 4.46 percent the prior week. The 4.21
percent rate reported for the week ended Oct. 8 was the lowest
in records going back to 1990.  At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be about $506, or $20 less than a year
ago when the rate was 4.83 percent.  Mortgage Rates  The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 3.83
percent from 3.87 percent, and the rate on a one-year adjustable
mortgage dropped to 7.09 percent from 7.11 percent.  Foreclosure moratoria at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other
banks, along with government investigations into faulty
paperwork, threaten to further delay the housing recovery as
residential properties slated for repossession take longer to
come to market.  Sales of  existing homes  fell 2.2 percent in October, more
than forecast, to a 4.43 million annual rate, a report from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday. The median
price dropped 0.9 percent from a year earlier.  Homebuilders are echoing concern about the lack of a pickup
in demand. D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder
by revenue, expects 2011 to be “challenging” for the industry
as consumer confidence and employment remain weak, Chief
Executive Officer  Donald Tomnitz  said on a Nov. 12 earnings
conference call. The spring selling season, the strongest for
builders, may fail to bring the traditional boost in demand, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
