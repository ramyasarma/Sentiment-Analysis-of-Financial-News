A Swedish appeals court upheld an
arrest warrant on rape charges for WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange .  The ruling means that an international arrest warrant for
Assange is valid, the  Swedish Prosecution Authority  said today.
The court made an “adjustment” to the warrant that the crime
is regarded as “less serious,” the court said.  Bjoern Hurtig, Assange’s lawyer, said he would appeal the
case to the supreme court. “We are disappointed, but are
hopeful about an appeal after the court changed the wording,”
Hurtig said.  Sweden’s criminal police had issued an international
warrant for Assange, Interpol said on Nov. 20. He had been under
investigation on rape charges in Sweden since August.  The alleged crimes occurred while Assange was in Sweden
delivering lectures on WikiLeaks’ publishing of classified U.S.
military documents related to the war in Afghanistan. Hurtig
said his client didn’t commit any crimes.  WikiLeaks.org receives confidential material that
governments and businesses want to keep secret and posts the
information on the Internet “so readers and historians alike
can see evidence of the truth,” the organization says on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
