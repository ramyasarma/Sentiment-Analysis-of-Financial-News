Sales of new homes unexpectedly
dropped in October, showing near record-low borrowing costs are
failing to lift the industry that precipitated the recession.  Purchases  decreased 8.1 percent to a 283,000 annual rate,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.
The  median estimate  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected an increase to a 312,000 annual pace. Sales reached a
275,000 pace in August, the lowest since data collection began in
1963.  An overhang of distressed properties and an  unemployment
rate  hovering near 10 percent may restrain sales of new homes
into 2011. Concerns over faulty foreclosure proceedings threaten
to further delay the mending process.  “Conditions in the housing market remain challenged,” said
John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at State Street
Global Markets LLC in Boston. “Lending conditions remain tight
and there is concern that there’s another down leg in home
prices.”  Other Commerce Department reports today showed consumer
spending rose in October for a fifth month and orders for durable
goods unexpectedly dropped.  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent
gain in September that was larger than previously estimated.
Incomes climbed 0.5 percent and the Federal Reserve’s preferred
measure of inflation was little changed, capping the smallest 12-
month gain since records began five decades ago.  Durable Goods  Bookings for goods meant to last several years fell 3.3
percent after a revised 5 percent jump in September that was
larger than previously estimated.  Figures from the Labor Department showed applications for
unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since
July 2008, reinforcing evidence the labor market is healing.
Jobless  claims  declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week ended
Nov. 20. The median projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000.  Also today, consumer sentiment in November climbed more than
forecast. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
reading for this month increased to 71.6, the highest since June,
from 67.7 a month earlier. The preliminary November figure was
69.3.  Shares Climb  Stocks rose after the reports. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index climbed 0.9 percent to 1,191.06 at 10:15 a.m. in New York.
Treasury securities fell, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-
year note up to 2.84 percent from 2.78 percent late yesterday.  Economists estimates for new-home sales ranged from 295,000
to 337,000.  The median price decreased 9.4 percent from October 2009 to
$194,900, the lowest level since October 2003. The year-over-year
drop was the biggest since July 2009.  Part of the drop in prices may be due to regional
differences in sales.  Purchases fell in three of four regions, led by a 24 percent
drop in the West, where the median price is usually higher.
Purchases climbed 3.1 percent in the South, the area where prices
are lowest.  Less Supply  The supply of homes at the current sales rate rose to 8.6
months’ worth from 7.9 months in September. There were 202,000
new houses on the market at the end of October, the fewest since
June 1968.  Reports earlier this month showed the housing market is
stuck near recession levels. Housing starts in October fell to a
519,000 annual rate, the fewest since a record low reached in
April 2009, the Commerce Department said this month.  Sales of  existing homes , which now make up more than 90
percent of the market, decreased by 2.2 percent to a 4.43 million
rate in October, the National Association of Realtors said
yesterday. The pace was still the third-lowest on record going
back a decade.  Home resales are tabulated when a contract is closed, while
new-home sales are counted at the time an agreement is signed,
making them a leading indicator of demand.  Economists are debating the likely effect on new-home sales
from the foreclosure moratoriums and regulators’ probes into
faulty paperwork. Most agree the moratoria pose a risk to housing
sales as a whole.  Fed’s View  “The moratoriums recently announced by some banks on the
sale of properties they had seized in foreclosures were likely to
damp home sales further in the near term,” the Federal Reserve
said in minutes of its Nov. 2-3 meeting released yesterday.
“Despite further declines in mortgage interest rates in recent
months, other factors continued to restrain housing demand,
including consumer pessimism about the outlook for jobs and
income, the depressed rate of household formation, and tight
underwriting standards for mortgages.”  D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, expects 2011 to be “challenging” for the industry as
consumer confidence and employment remain weak, Chief Executive
Officer Donald Tomnitz said on a Nov. 12 earnings conference
call. The spring selling season, the strongest for builders, may
fail to bring the traditional boost in demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
