Golden Saint Resources Pty , an
Australian gold exploration company, plans to develop wave-
energy projects off the coast of western Africa.  The company is planning to raise A$30 million ($29.2
million) in an  initial public offering  in March to help fund the
projects, Chairman Cyril D’Silva said in an interview. The
shares will trade on the Australian Stock Exchange.  “We plan to work with partners to harness the marine
energy potential in west Africa,” said D’Silva. “The region
offers a good opportunity for us to provide what could be a
reliable and renewable source of energy to parts of Africa.”  Golden Saint’s main business is mining for gold and
diamonds in Liberia and Sierra Leone.  “We are in the process of acquiring four exploration
concessions for gold and diamond in Sierra Leone and currently
hold prospecting licenses in some parts Liberia,” D’Silva said.
“We are also in advanced stages of acquiring an exploration
concession in Liberia.”  Golden Saint also intends to acquire a jewelry company with
funds from the share offering. The company has a retail outlet,
a manufacturing division and a diamond wholesale division,
D’Silva said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
