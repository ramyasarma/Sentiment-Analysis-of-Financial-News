The  World Bank  will lend $100
million to Uganda to finance projects aimed at reducing poverty
in the East African nation, Finance Minister Syda Bbumba said.  The Washington-based lender will provide the loan through
its International Development Agency to improve “service
delivery” and “infrastructure development,” Bbumba told
reporters today in the capital, Kampala.  The 40-year concessional loan, with a grace period of 10
years, will carry an interest rate of less than 1 percent, the
minister said. The World Bank is expected to release the entire
loan as early as next week and it will be spent in the 12 months
through June, she said.  The loan is the eighth credit line the World Bank has given
Uganda to support its budget, with earlier loans worth a total
of $760 million, Bbumba said. About 23.3 percent of Uganda’s
population live below the poverty line, compared with 31.1
percent in 2005-06, the minister said, without giving details.  The country’s population is rising by 3.2 percent a year,
one of the fastest growth rates in the world, with more than
half the population under the age of 15, Bbumba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
