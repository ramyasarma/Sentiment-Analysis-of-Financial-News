U.S. Treasuries advanced, leaving
the 10-year yield one basis point lower at 2.76 percent as of
9:09 a.m. in London.  Ten-year rates increased by as much as three basis points
earlier amid speculation reports today will show consumer
spending and orders for durable goods in the U.S. rose last
month, adding to signs the economic recovery is sustainable.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $29 billion of seven-year
securities today, the last of three auctions this week totaling
$99 billion. A $35 billion five- year auction yesterday
attracted bids for 2.65 times the amount available, the lowest
since June. Indirect bidders bought 31.5 percent of the notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
