London & Stamford Property Plc , co-
owner of the U.K.’s third-largest mall, said first-half profit
rose 2.5 percent on acquisitions and increasing real estate
values.  Net income for the six months through September advanced to
16.3 million pounds ($25.8 million) from 15.9 million pounds a
year earlier, the Guernsey-registered company said in a
statement today.  “We continue to assess a wide range of opportunities to
deploy our 1 billion pounds of firepower, but we remain cautious
in our approach,” Chairman  Raymond Mould  said in the statement.
“We remain confident that we will continue to be able to
acquire property that is consistent with our investment
strategy.”  London & Stamford, founded in 2007 by Mould and  Patrick Vaughan , spent more than 235 million pounds on acquisitions in
the period, mainly on distribution centers, to benefit from
rising rents and a recovery in property values. It spent 205
million pounds this month buying 10 properties. The company and
a partner purchased a 50 percent stake in northern England’s
Meadowhall mall from British Land Co. in February 2009 for 588
million pounds.  Net rental income increased to 15 million pounds from 6.7
million pounds a year earlier, the company said in the
statement. London & Stamford approved an interim dividend of 3
pence a share, payable on Dec. 20, it said.  Earnings per share fell to 3.3 pence from 4.5 pence a year
earlier as the number of shares increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
