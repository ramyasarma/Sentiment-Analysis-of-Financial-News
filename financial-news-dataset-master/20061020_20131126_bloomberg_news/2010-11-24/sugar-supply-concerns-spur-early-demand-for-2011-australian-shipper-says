Queensland Sugar Ltd.  cut its export
forecast as above-average rainfall reduces production in  Australia , the third-largest exporter.  Shipments may drop to 2.2 million metric tons, Neil Taylor,
chief executive officer of the Brisbane-based company, said in a
statement today. That compares with a forecast earlier this year
of 2.9 million to 3 million tons.  Raw sugar in New York has more than doubled in the past
seven months, reaching a 29-year high amid concern that adverse
weather will curb production in  Brazil , the world’s largest
shipper, and  India . Heavy rainfall in Australia this year has
hampered harvesting and curbed planting for next season,
producers group Canegrowers said last month.  Queensland Sugar, which handles more than 90 percent of
Australia’s exports, was still receiving supplies and all
commitments to international customers would be met, Taylor said
in the statement today.  Raw sugar for March delivery on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  rose 3.7 percent to 29.5 cents per pound on Dec. 3. The
contract reached 33.39 cents a pound on Nov. 11, the highest
price since 1981.  Sugar supplies globally will exceed demand by 1.3 million
tons for the 2010-2011 crop, less than half a previous estimate,
the London-based International Sugar Organization said in a
report on Nov. 17. Output is likely to increase to a record 169
million tons, 1.4 million tons lower than an August forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
