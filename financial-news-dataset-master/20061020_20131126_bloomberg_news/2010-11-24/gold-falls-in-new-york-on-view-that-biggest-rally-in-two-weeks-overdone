Gold fell for the first time in
three days as demand for a haven dropped after the euro
rebounded and Korean concerns eased.  The euro was little changed against the dollar, and Asian
stocks pared losses after the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier to
take part in exercises off the Korean Peninsula. Yesterday, gold
jumped 1.6 percent, the most since Nov. 4, after North Korea
fired artillery at a South Korean island and the euro plunged on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis may spread.  “Gold is giving back some of the flight-to-safety bid,”
said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.
“The Korean conflict hasn’t erupted into something bigger yet,
and the euro has stabilized.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $4.70, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,375 an ounce at 1:53 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. The metal has gained 25 percent this year, reaching
a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  “Gold prices may be nearing a short-term top,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. “We
wouldn’t anticipate safe-haven demand lasting much longer.”  The metal is forming a “head-and-shoulders” price
pattern, which may indicate further declines, Pawlicki said.  The chart pattern occurs when prices form three consecutive
peaks, with the middle being the highest. The start of a decline
is signaled when the metal falls below a support level in line
with the low points between the peaks.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 4.4 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $27.603 an ounce. The metal has jumped 64 percent
this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained $4.75, or
0.7 percent, to $697.45 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has surged 71 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose 70 cents to
$1,658.40 an ounce. The metal has climbed 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
