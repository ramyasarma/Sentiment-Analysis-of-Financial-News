Exxon Mobil Corp. , the world’s
biggest oil company, invested 17 billion kroner ($2.8 billion)
in Norway in 2009 and expects the same levels for 2010 and 2011,
as it works to maintain production in the Scandinavian country.  Exxon, which has a daily output of 410,000 barrels of oil
equivalent in Norway, invested 6 billion kroner in 2008 and last
year estimated investments would stay at about 10 billion
kroner.  “It’s driven by the Ringhorne drilling, the ramp-up in
drilling activity, the ramp-up in new projects,” John Whelan,
operations manager for North Sea production at Exxon in Norway,
said today in an interview. “A lot of the drilling and the
activity we’re doing now is to keep production.”  Norway’s oil output peaked in 2000 and is forecast to drop
6 percent this year to about 1.87 million barrels a day,
according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The industry
has urged the government to open up more of the northern areas
to exploration.  Exxon is not seeking to reduce its presence in the country,
Whelan said. Norway accounts for 10 percent of Exxon’s worldwide
production and it has participated in about one-third of all
Norwegian discoveries since 2007.  “Norway is very important for us,” he said. “We still
see significant life in our existing operating assets.”  Whelan declined to comment on a report by the Sunday Times
that it has started a $2 billion auction of North Sea oil
assets, including its Beryl field.  “We don’t comment on speculation around our assets,”
Whelan said. “We’re a long-term investor in the U.K. and we’re
going to continue to be a major investor in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
