AFC Ajax NV captain Luis Suarez
accepted a seven-game suspension from the Dutch football
association KNVB after biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal
on the shoulder during a Nov. 20 match in Amsterdam.  He’ll next be able to play Feb. 4 in a domestic match, when
Ajax takes on De Graafschap, the Amsterdam-based club said today
in a statement on its website. The Uruguayan player will be
eligible for the Dec. 8 Champions League match against AC Milan.
In total, Suarez will be a spectator for six matches, and the
cup match against AZ from Alkmaar.  The Nov. 20 game in Amsterdam ended 0-0. PSV leads the
league by three points, and is six points ahead of fourth-place
Ajax. The referee didn’t see the incident, which was picked up
by television coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
