A court-imposed sanction against
EchoStar Satellite LLC, for “egregious” conduct in destroying
e-mail evidence, may jeopardize the company’s defense of a
$2.5 billion Cablevision Systems Corp. contract suit.  The decision, which was made public Nov. 9, also highlights
 EchoStar ’s history of punishments for breaking the rules in
other court cases.  “EchoStar has systematically destroyed evidence in direct
violation of the law and in the face of a ruling by a federal
court that criticized EchoStar for the same bad-faith conduct,”
New York state judge  Richard Lowe  wrote in an opinion in the
case, filed in 2008 by Voom HD Holdings LLC,  a Cablevision unit.   Lowe said that EchoStar erased e-mails Voom could have used
to help prove its claims. As punishment, Lowe said he will tell
jurors that EchoStar destroyed evidence and that the jury may
assume the evidence would have been helpful to Voom’s case.  EchoStar climbed 9 cents to $20.76 at 1:36 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . EchoStar spokeswoman Kathy
Miller and Cablevision spokeswoman  Kim Kerns  declined to
comment.  The ruling comes in a suit by Voom that seeks $2.5 billion
in damages from EchoStar’s alleged breach of a 15-year
distribution agreement. The 2005 contract called for Voom to
provide 21 high-definition television channels to EchoStar,
which at the time operated the Dish Network, the second-biggest
provider of satellite television in the U.S. after DirecTV.  Dish Network  EchoStar and Dish became separate companies in 2008 when
EchoStar Communications Corp. changed its name to  Dish Network
Corp. , focusing on satellite television, and spun off EchoStar
Corp. EchoStar provides Dish with the technology it uses to
provide satellite television to its customers, Dish said on its
website. Both companies are based in Englewood, Colorado.
 Charles Ergen , the president, chairman and chief executive
officer of Dish, also serves as EchoStar’s chairman.  Two years into the contract, EchoStar found itself paying
too much to Voom and on Jan. 20, 2008, began trying to
manufacture an excuse to terminate the agreement, Voom claims in
its suit. EchoStar claimed Voom wasn’t investing $100 million a
year in the high-definition service, as defined in the contract,
and said it was permitted to end the agreement. Voom, which no
longer provides high-definition programming in the U.S., sued. A
trial date hasn’t been set.  Requests Denied  Lowe, who is presiding over the case in state court in
Manhattan, this month denied requests by both sides to rule in
their favor before trial. He did grant a request by Voom to
sanction EchoStar, finding that the company failed to block the
automatic deletion of e-mails after seven days at a time the
company should have known it would be involved in litigation
over the Voom deal.  EchoStar had been sanctioned in an earlier sexual-
harassment case, filed by former employee Dino Broccoli. In that
case, a federal judge in Maryland criticized EchoStar’s
“extraordinary” policy of permanently deleting e-mails after
21 days.  “It appears that, since the Broccoli decision, EchoStar
reduced its automatic delete function, deleting e-mails after
only seven days instead of after 21 days,” Lowe wrote.
“EchoStar failed to preserve documents not only prior to Voom
HD commencing litigation, but also for four months after this
litigation was commenced, making it even more egregious than
Broccoli.”  ‘Grossly Negligent’  Lowe said EchoStar acted in bad faith and that its failure
to preserve evidence that should have been turned over to Voom
was at least “grossly negligent.”  Lowe also barred EchoStar from calling its expert witness
on damages at the trial, blaming “EchoStar’s last-minute
finagling with expert reports, believing that it can play fast
and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its
litigation posture.”  In addition to the Broccoli case, Voom argued in court
papers that EchoStar had been sanctioned or criticized at least
seven other times in recent years for misconduct in litigation.  “It’s highly unusual for a company to have such a high
frequency of discovery abuse allegations and sanctions against
it,” said Robert Scott, a Dallas-area lawyer who is an expert
on media and technology law.  Negative Instruction  Scott said EchoStar, by alienating the judge and prompting
the negative instruction to any jury that hears the case, may
lose at trial.  “That’s not the kind of instruction you want the judge to
give,” Scott said. “It almost comes across as an instruction
to rule in favor” of the complaining party, he said.  The most serious case currently involving Dish and
EchoStar, according to  Craig Moffett , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein in New York, is a patent dispute with  TiVo Inc.  over
digital video recording. A federal appeals court in Washington
upheld a verdict that EchoStar was infringing a TiVo patent for
“time warp” technology that lets users record a program and
play parts of it back at the same time.  EchoStar and Dish, which had been ordered to disable their
DVR service, continued providing it to customers, claiming the
new system was different from the one that was found to be
infringing. A judge in the case hit EchoStar with a $90 million
fine for contempt of court, which was upheld by a three-judge
appeals panel. On Nov. 9, the full appeals court heard arguments
in the case.  Voom argued that the TiVo case shows EchoStar’s “general
disregard for the judicial process.”  The case is Voom HD Holdings LLC v. Echostar Satellite LLC,
No. 600292/08, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
