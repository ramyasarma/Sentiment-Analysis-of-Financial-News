Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar amid increased supplies of the U.S. currency
from Kenyans living abroad and sales by exporters of
agricultural products.  The shilling gained 0.1 percent to trade at 80.35 per
dollar at 1:04 p.m. in Nairobi. The currency ended trading at
80.45 yesterday.  “Inflows from agricultural exports and remittances are
having a bearing on the shilling,”  Joel Mbuvi , head of Treasury
at African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today from
the city.  About 14 percent of Kenya’s adult population receive an
average payment from abroad of $105 seven times a year,
according to Bendixen and Amandi, a U.S.-based market-research
company. Kenyans living in foreign countries sent home $1.9
billion in the 12 months through September, more than triple the
amount previously estimated, the group said last month.
Remittances to sub-Saharan African countries are expected to
grow by about 2 percent in 2010, according to the World Bank.  The shilling may depreciate in the next two weeks because
of demand for foreign exchange by Kenyan importers, said  Bernard Matimu , chief dealer at  NIC Bank Ltd.  in Nairobi, said in a
phone interview.  “Residual demand by importers has subdued the shilling and
going forward it’s expected to trade low as importers close the
year in the first week of December,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
