Ford Motor Co. , seeking to regain an
investment-grade credit rating, reduced its  debt  by more than
$1.9 billion by paying  investors  in its convertible debt to swap
their notes for shares.  Investors converted $554 million of 4.25 percent senior
convertible notes due Dec. 15, 2036, and $1.99 billion of 4.25
percent senior convertible notes due Nov. 15, 2016, the company
said today in a statement. The conversions lowered the debt in
Ford’s automotive operations to $20.9 billion on a pro-forma
basis, compared with about $19.8 billion in gross cash.  Ford has reduced its automotive operations’  debt  by $12.8
billion this year, lowering annual interest costs by almost $1
billion. The company said today it will have more  cash  than debt
by the end of the year as its auto operations remain profitable
and its credit unit pays it a $1 billion dividend.  “Ford has sworn off debt,” said  Joe Phillippi , principal
of consulting firm AutoTrends Inc. in Short Hills, New Jersey.
“They are building an armor-plated balance sheet for the
inevitable next downturn, and they will benefit mightily as the
market recovers and grows.”  Moody’s Investors Service  rates  Ford Ba2, the second level
below investment grade, and Standard & Poor’s rates it B+, two
steps lower. Ford lost its investment-grade  ratings  in 2005 as
rising gasoline prices and falling truck sales led to $30
billion in losses from 2006 through 2008.  Ford rose 25 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $15.95 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
gained 60 percent this year.  Bond Price  Ford’s $1.8 billion of 7.45 percent notes due in July 2031
rose 0.375 cent to 108.625 cents on the dollar at 10 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Ford could return to an investment-grade credit rating in
the first half of 2011, Phillippi said. Ford’s earnings power
will be enhanced by cutting interest payments by almost $1
billion, he said.  “These successful conversion offers represent another
significant step toward our goal of reducing our automotive debt
and improving our balance sheet,” Chief Financial Officer  Lewis Booth  said in the statement.  The company said it would take a charge of about $960
million in the fourth quarter to account for the conversion
offers.  Conversion Terms  Ford gave holders of the 2036 notes 108.6957 shares of
common stock and a cash payment equal to $190 for every $1,000
in principal amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest.
Ford gave holders of the 2016 notes 107.5269 shares and a cash
payment equal to $215 for every $1,000 in principal amount,
along with accrued and unpaid interest.  The conversions will save $180 million in annual interest
 expenses , Ford said. The shares issued in the offer had already
been included in the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker’s
calculations of earnings per share since the beginning of 2010.  Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy
last year, earned $6.37 billion in the first nine months of the
year, the most since 1998. New models such as the Fiesta
subcompact and redesigned Taurus sedan have helped Ford’s U.S.
sales rise 21 percent this year, almost twice the market’s gain
of 11 percent.  Ford’s debt is no longer a competitive disadvantage versus
General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, which had obligations
extinguished in bankruptcy last year, Phillippi said.  “Ford’s debt doesn’t prevent them from doing anything,”
Phillippi said. “This is going to make people feel even more
positive about the Ford story.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
