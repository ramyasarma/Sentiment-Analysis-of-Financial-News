Portugal led a jump in the cost of
insuring against default on European sovereign debt, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Portuguese government bonds jumped 13.5 basis
points to a record 500.5, according to CMA in London. Swaps
on Ireland climbed 13 basis points to 588, Italy rose 9.5 to
209, Spain rose 9 to a record 310 and Greece was 4.5 higher at
1,024.5. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index increased
2.5 basis points to a record 184.  Sovereign concerns undermined confidence in European banks.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior debt of
25 European banks and insurers jumped 10 basis points to 161,
the highest in almost five months, and the subordinated index
was up 15 at 273.  The cost of insuring corporate debt also rose. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings increased 13 basis points to 489, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings increased 2.5 basis
point to 108.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
