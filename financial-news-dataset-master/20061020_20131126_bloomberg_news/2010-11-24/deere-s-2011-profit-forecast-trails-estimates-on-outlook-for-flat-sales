Deere & Co. , the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, forecast fiscal 2011 profit that missed
analysts’ estimates and said U.S., Canadian and South American
sales will be “flat.”  Net Income will be $2.1 billion in the year through October
2011, Moline, Illinois-based Deere said today in a statement.
That’s equal to about $4.92 a share, according to Bloomberg
calculations. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey  estimated  net
income of $2.3 billion, or $5.34 a share. The shares fell in New
York trading.  Deere, led by Chief Executive Officer  Samuel Allen , said
sales in U.S. and Canada will be affected by the transition of
farmers to equipment that meets new emission standards. South
American sales may level off after being “strong” in 2010, the
company said.  “South America we had expected a modest pullback,” said
 Larry De Maria , an analyst for Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. in New
York who has a “buy” rating on the shares. “North American
sales should be up. Deere tends to give a conservative
outlook.”  Deere  fell  34 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $76 at 7:32 a.m.
before the start of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.  The
shares  gained 41 percent this year before today.  Fourth-quarter  net income  was $457.2 million, or $1.07 a
share, in the three months through October, compared with a net
loss of $222.8 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Deere also
said today. That beat the 97-cent  average estimate  of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 35 percent to $7.2
billion from $5.33 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
