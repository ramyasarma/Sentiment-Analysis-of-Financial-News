Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of  France
Telecom SA , will begin rolling out a third-generation mobile-
phone network in the first half of next year after receiving a
license from the industry regulator.  The permit will increase Internet usage in East Africa’s
biggest economy,  Charles Njoroge , director general of the
 Communications Commission of Kenya , told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital. Kenya had 7.8 million Internet users by
June 2010, he said.  “We will be able to give more and more services,” Telkom
Kenya Chief Executive Officer  Mickael Ghossein  said at the media
briefing. So-called 3G networks enable faster transmission of
data and allow mobile-phone users to download music and video to
their handsets.  Telkom Kenya, which operates under the Orange brand,
competes with  Safaricom Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest mobile-phone
company, and Airtel Networks Kenya Ltd., a unit of New Delhi-
based  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  Safaricom is currently the only
operator of a 3G network in Kenya, while Airtel plans to start
offering the service in the first quarter of next year, Managing
Director Rene Meza said on Nov. 22  Mobile operators in  Kenya  are becoming more reliant on data
for revenue after the industry regulator in August halved the
rates that operators charge each other to connect voice calls
across networks to 2.21 shillings (3 cents). That triggered a
round of cuts in call costs by companies to less than 2
shillings per minute and in some cases free calls during off-
peak hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
