Canadian business profits decreased
in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, led
by financial companies.  Operating profits shrank 0.3 percent between July and
September to C$61.5 billion ($60.2 billion), the second
consecutive decline, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  The Bank of Canada predicts that exports and business
investment will lead economic growth through 2012 after
companies cut spending during a recession that ended last year.
Statistics Canada reports third-quarter gross domestic product
Nov. 30, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict a 1.5
percent gain.  Operating profits at financial companies fell 3.7 percent
to C$14.8 billion, Statistics Canada said. Insurance company
profits dropped 24 percent to C$1.2 billion, while profits at
credit intermediaries such as banks declined 3.3 percent to
C$6.8 billion on trading losses.  Oil and gas companies’ profits rose 16 percent to C$4.1
billion. Manufacturers saw profits rise by 0.6 percent to C$10.8
billion.  Total company operating profits were 14 percent greater in
the third quarter than they were in the same period a year
earlier, Statistics Canada said.  After-tax profits rose 21 percent to C$54.6 billion in the
quarter, an increase of 24 percent from the same period a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
