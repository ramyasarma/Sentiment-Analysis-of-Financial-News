Australia’s dollar rallied from its
steepest drop in a month on prospects global economic growth
will weather Ireland’s finanical crisis and military tensions in
the Koreas.  The Aussie gained for a third day, reaching a record high
against the euro, after Standard & Poor’s downgraded Ireland’s
credit rating. The New Zealand dollar advanced on speculation
its 1.7 percent drop yesterday was excessive after North Korea
fired at a South Korea island.  “Developments in Ireland and the Koreas won’t change the
fact that the global economy is recovering gradually,” said
 Masashi Murata , vice president of foreign exchange in Tokyo at
BBH Investment Services Inc., a unit of New York-based Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. “People should buy the Aussie against
the euro. Commodity currencies are set to be bought on dips.”  Australia’s currency gained 1.1 percent to 98.27 U.S. cents
as of 11:38 a.m. in New York from 97.23 cents yesterday. The
Aussie sank 1.7 percent yesterday, the most on a closing basis
since Oct. 19. It rose to 73.49 euro cents from 72.74, after
earlier reaching 73.53 euro cents, the highest level ever. The
Aussie climbed to 82.01 yen from 80.86 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to 76.29 U.S. cents
from 75.87 cents yesterday when it touched 75.78, the weakest
since Oct. 29. The kiwi gained to 63.66 yen from 63.09 yen.  The Australian dollar has climbed against all of its major
counterparts during the past six months on prospects for
commodity-driven economic growth and the yield advantage of the
nation’s debt compared with other developed markets. Swaps
traders are betting the Reserve Bank of Australia will raise its
target rate by 35 basis points during the next 12 months,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index . A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  RBA Rates  The RBA has lifted its key interest rate seven times since
October 2009, the latest being a quarter-point increase to 4.75
percent on Nov. 2. That compares with rates near zero in the
U.S. and Japan.  Ireland had its long-term sovereign rating cut to A from
AA- and its short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+ by S&P. The
ratings company cited concerns about additional borrowing by the
government as it seeks external aid from the International
Monetary Fund and the European Union.  The New Zealand dollar rose against most major counterparts
as the United Nations Command proposed to North Korea’s military
to hold talks between officers at the rank of general about the
country’s shelling of a South Korean island. The UN Command said
today in an e-mailed statement that it will investigate the
incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
