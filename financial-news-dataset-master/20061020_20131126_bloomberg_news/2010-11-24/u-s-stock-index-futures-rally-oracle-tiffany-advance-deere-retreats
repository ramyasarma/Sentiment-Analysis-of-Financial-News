U.S. stocks rose, ending a two-day
decline for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as jobless claims
fell to the lowest level since July 2008, consumer confidence
topped projections and  Tiffany & Co.  beat earnings forecasts.  Monster Worldwide Inc. , the largest online-recruiting
company, rallied 9.6 percent as applications for unemployment
benefits fell more than estimated. Tiffany, the second-biggest
luxury jewelry retailer, rose 5.3 percent to a record high.
 Amazon.com Inc.  jumped 5.4 percent as Citigroup Inc. said it’s
benefiting the most from growth in online retailing.  Oracle
Corp.  gained 2 percent after a jury said SAP AG must pay the
software company $1.3 billion for copyright infringement.  The  S&P 500  gained 1.5 percent to 1,198.35 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The index dropped yesterday even after a government report
showed third-quarter gross domestic product expanded faster than
economists projected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
150.91 points, or 1.4 percent, to 11,187.28 today.  “We’ve been getting positive economic surprises,” said
 Michael Mullaney , who helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary
Trust Co. in Boston. “Jobless claims figures have been a lot
better than expected. There’s no risk of a double-dip recession.
We’ve had a pullback coming from an overbought level. I’d see a
stronger stock market into year-end.”  The  S&P 500  has fallen 2.2 percent since reaching a two-
year high of 1,225.85 on Nov. 5 amid concern about Europe’s debt
crisis and speculation China will boost interest rates. The
index rose 17 percent from its 2010 low on July 2 as the Federal
Reserve prepared to increase asset purchases and more than 70
percent of S&P 500 companies beat the average analyst profit
estimate for the sixth straight quarter.  Jobless Claims  U.S. equity futures rallied today after the government said
jobless  claims  fell by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week ended Nov.
20. The median projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a drop to 435,000. The S&P 500 maintained gains
after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final  index  of
November consumer sentiment increased to 71.6, the highest since
June and more than the median economist estimate of 69.5.  Stocks rose in Europe as a gauge of German business
confidence improved and Ireland announced plans to cut spending
by 20 percent. Welfare cuts of 2.8 billion euros ($3.8 billion)
and income tax increases of 1.9 billion euros are among the
steps planned to narrow the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of gross
domestic product by the end of 2014.  ‘Taking Off’  “It seems things are taking off,” said  Randy Bateman ,
chief investment officer at Huntington Asset Management in
Columbus, Ohio, which oversees $13.8 billion. “For the most
part, the economic numbers were good. There’s some degree of
resolution of the Irish crisis. The economy is recovering.
Christmas spending will certainly be better than last year.”  Since 1946, the Dow has rallied on both the day before and
after Thanksgiving about 70 percent of the time, according to
Bespoke Investment Group. On average, the 30-company equity
index has risen by 0.3 percent on each of those days, Bespoke
said. U.S. stock exchanges are closed tomorrow for the holiday.  Staffing companies rallied.  Monster Worldwide  had the
biggest gain in the S&P 500, rising 9.6 percent to $22.36, the
highest close since June 2008. Robert Half International Inc.
advanced 3.7 percent to $28.13 while Kforce Inc. increased 2.9
percent to $15.43.  Consumer Spending  Measures of economically sensitive stocks, from companies
that rely on consumers’ discretionary spending, industrial and
 technology  makers to commodities producers led the gains in the
S&P 500 on increased optimism about global growth.  Caterpillar Inc ., the world’s biggest maker of construction
equipment, advanced 2.5 percent to $84.69. United Technologies
Corp., the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Carrier air
conditioners, gained 2.6 percent to $76.09.  Boeing Co.  rose 2.9 percent to $65.41. The world’s largest
aerospace company may be able to deliver the 787 Dreamliner jet
faster than expected after suspending test flights to
investigate why one of the planes caught fire, Cowen & Co. said
in a note. The stock may rebound on the company’s next 787
update, Cowen said.  Tiffany  jumped 5.3 percent to $61.33, a record for the
stock. The luxury jewelry retailer raised its full-year earnings
forecast after third-quarter profit rose 27 percent, helped by
new stores and sales of handbags.  A gauge of  retailers  in the S&P 500 led gains among 24
industries, rising 2.6 percent, before the start of the holiday
shopping season.  ‘Market Premium’  Amazon gained 5.4 percent to $177.25. The largest online
retailer deserves a “market premium” because of its strong
earnings outlook compared with the industry, Citigroup Inc.
analyst  Mark S. Mahaney  wrote in a note today. He recommends
buying the stock and has a share-price estimate of $190.  Oracle  climbed 2 percent to $27.74 after a California jury
said SAP, the world’s largest maker of business application
software, must pay $1.3 billion in the largest award for
copyright infringement.  Hewlett-Packard Co.  fell the most in the Dow, dropping 1
percent to $43.75. The world’s largest computer maker was
removed from the “short-term buy” list at UBS AG.  The benchmark measure of U.S. stock options slumped 5.2
percent to 19.56. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, rose the most since Aug. 11
yesterday. The gauge, which measures the cost of using options
to protect against S&P 500 declines, is down by more than half
from this year’s peak of 45.79 in May.  “There’s ‘risk on’ back into the market,” said  Dan Veru ,
co-chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management LLC
in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which oversees $3.1 billion. “From an
economic standpoint, things are getting better. We’ve had a
strong corporate earnings season. The path of least resistance
will be higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
