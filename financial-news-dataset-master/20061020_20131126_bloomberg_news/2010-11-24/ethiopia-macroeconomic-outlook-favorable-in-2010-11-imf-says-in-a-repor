Ethiopia’s macroeconomic outlook is
“broadly favorable” for 2010-11, the International Monetary
Fund said.  “After the large devaluation of the currency on Sept. 1,
real gross domestic product growth will rise to 8.5 percent,
reflecting an anticipated bumper harvest and ongoing strong
goods and services exports,” the fund said in a report posted
on its website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
