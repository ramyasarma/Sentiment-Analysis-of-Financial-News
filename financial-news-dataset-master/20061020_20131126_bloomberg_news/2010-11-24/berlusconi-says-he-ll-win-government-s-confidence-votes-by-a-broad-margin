Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
said he was confident he would win confidence votes next month
that threaten to topple his government and said the political
instability could hurt the country’s credit rating and make it
more expensive to sell bonds.  At a Rome press conference, Berlusconi called on Gianfranco
Fini, his former ally who is now leading the challenge to
Berlusconi’s rule, to “take a step back” before trying to
topple the government at a time when when investors are shunning
the debt of Europe’s high-deficit nations after Ireland said it
would seek a bailout.  Political stability is key to the country maintaining its
current credit rating, he said. Italy needs to sell 250 billion
euros of debt next year, he said. The country is facing surging
borrowing costs from the spread of Europe’s debt crisis.  Berlusconi also said that the Union of Centrist party could
lend his governemnt external support if he survives the
confidence votes. He was “confident” he would win the Dec. 14
votes by a “broad margin,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
