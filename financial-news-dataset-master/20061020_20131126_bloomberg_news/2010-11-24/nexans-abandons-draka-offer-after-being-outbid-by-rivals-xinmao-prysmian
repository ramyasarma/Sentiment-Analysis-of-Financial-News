Nexans , the world’s largest cable
maker, abandoned its 15 euro-a-share offer for  Draka Holding NV 
after being outbid by China’s Tianjin Xinmao S&T Investment
Corp. and  Prysmian SpA  of Italy.  Nexans “will continue to follow the evolution of the
situation regarding Draka,” Celine Revillon, a spokeswoman
for the Paris-based manufacturer, said by telephone. Nexans
“will under the present circumstances not submit an offer,”
the company said today in a statement.  Xinmao’s bid of 20.50 euros a share, valuing Amsterdam-
based Draka at 1 billion euros ($1.34 billion), threatens to
derail an 840 million-euro offer from Prysmian that was accepted
by Draka management. Nexans’s non-binding bid was rejected by
the Dutch company.  Draka is scheduled to hold talks with  Xinmao , while
Prysmian has said it won’t increase its bid. Xinmao, based in
Tianjin, northern China, is a unit of Xinmao Group, whose
businesses include optical fiber and cable manufacturing,
industrial real estate, mining and wind energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
