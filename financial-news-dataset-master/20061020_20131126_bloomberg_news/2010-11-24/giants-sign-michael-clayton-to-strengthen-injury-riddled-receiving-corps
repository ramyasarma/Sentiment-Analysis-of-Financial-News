The New York Giants signed  Michael Clayton  to strengthen a wide receiving corps depleted by
injuries.  Hakeem Nicks  is expected to be out three games with
swelling in his lower leg that compresses nerves and blood
vessels, the National Football League team said.  Steve Smith 
will miss this week’s game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with
a partial pectoral tear, and  Ramses Barden  and  Victor Cruz  are
on injured reserve.  The Giants (6-4) yesterday waived tight end Jake Ballard,
who made his NFL debut Nov. 21 in Philadelphia, to open a roster
spot for Clayton.  Clayton, 28, a former first-round draft pick in 2004 who
played six seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is coming from
the United Football League’s Omaha Nighthawks. In four games
there, he caught seven passes for 70 yards.  During his career with the Buccaneers, he had 221
receptions for 2,936 yards and 10 touchdowns in 84 games. He
also had 18 rushing attempts for 100 yards and returned 11
kickoffs for 241 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
