Deere & Co. , the world’s largest
farm-equipment maker, forecast fiscal 2011 profit that missed
analysts’ estimates and said U.S., Canadian and South American
sales of combines and tractors will be little changed.  Net income  will be about $2.1 billion in the year ending
October 2011, Moline, Illinois-based Deere projected today in a
statement. That’s equal to about $4.92 a share, according to
Bloomberg calculations. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey  expected
profit  of $2.3 billion, or $5.34 a share. Deere today topped the
average of analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit.  “North American sales should be up,” said  Larry De Maria ,
an analyst for Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. in New York who has a
“buy” rating on the shares. De Maria said he had expected a
“modest pullback” in South America. “Deere tends to give a
conservative outlook.”  Deere said production in the U.S. and Canada, which
accounted for about 65 percent of  2009 revenue , will be affected
in 2011 as a record number of new products are launched partly
to conform to new emissions standards for farm equipment. Deere
said its profit forecast reflects the cost of complying with the
regulations, transitioning to the new models and higher raw-
material expenses.  Deere  fell  11 cents to $76.23 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares  have gained 41
percent this year.  Equipment Sales  The company said net sales of equipment in fiscal 2011 will
climb as much as 12 percent to $26.4 billion, from $23.57
billion.  “Guidance for 2011 may disappoint some folks,”  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate credit at Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail.
“Deere’s management team has a long history of under-promising
and over-delivering.”  Deere said in August that fiscal fourth-quarter net income
would be about $375 million. It said today  net income  was $457.2
million, or $1.07 a share, in the period, compared with a net
loss of $222.8 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. The profit
beat the 97-cent  average estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Sales gained 35 percent to $7.2 billion from $5.33 billion
a year earlier. Revenue in the agriculture and turf unit rose 33
percent to $5.41 billion as Deere sold more agricultural
machinery to U.S. farmers in the quarter amid climbing corn,
soybean, wheat and cotton prices.  The unit’s operating profit, or sales minus operating costs
and expenses, was $662 million, compared with a loss of $24
million a year earlier.  Construction and forestry sales in the quarter increased 75
percent to $1.16 billion while operating profit rose to $54
million from $2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
