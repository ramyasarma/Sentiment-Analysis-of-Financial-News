Copper rose for the first day in
three in New York on speculation that supply may tighten further
as a strike at the world’s fourth-biggest mine continues.  Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi venture in
Chile said it will ignore union calls to resume wage talks and
keep negotiating directly with workers in a bid to end the
strike, which helped drive copper to a record this month. Prices
also gained after the International Copper Study Group said the
market’s supply shortfall jumped almost eightfold.  “The supply situation could tighten in the short term if
the strike at Collahuasi does not end soon,” Commerzbank AG
said in a report.  Copper for delivery in March added 4.4 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.755 a pound at 8:57 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months climbed 1.3 percent to
$8,245 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. All of the six
main metals traded on the LME gained, led by nickel.  Acceptances of Collahuasi’s offer have fallen short of the
required 756, from the 1,551-strong union, to dissolve the
strike under Chilean law, threatening to prolong the action.  World copper consumption exceeded output by 363,000 tons in
this year’s first eight months, compared with a 47,000-ton
shortfall a year, the ICSG said last night by e-mail. Usage
outpaced supply by 19,000 tons in August, it said.  ‘Demand Surprises’  “Demand recovery momentum continued to pick up pace, with
usage jumping 13% year-on-year (up from 6% the previous month),
above our expectations and continuing this year’s trend of
upside demand surprises,” Barclays Capital said in a report.  Copper also gained as German business confidence
unexpectedly rose to a record in November and Europe stocks and
U.S. index futures gained. The Munich-based Ifo institute said
its business climate index rose to 109.3, the highest level
since records for a reunified Germany began in 1991. Economists
predicted a decline to 107.5.  The metal fell in the past two sessions as the dollar
gained amid concern about Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. A
stronger dollar makes metals priced in the currency more
expensive in terms of other monies. Copper also slid on concern
demand may wane as China moves to limit inflation.  “Prices could fall below $8,000 over the near term, given
the potential for further risk in peripheral Europe and the
strong likelihood that China moves again to raise reserve
requirements or interest rates before the end of the year,”
said  Daniel Brebner , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London.  Higher Premium  Immediate-delivery LME copper’s premium to the three-month
contract jumped 15 percent to $32.25 a ton today. Prices moved
on Nov. 8 to a so-called backwardation, when nearby metal trades
above longer-dated contracts, potentially indicating concern
about near-term supply.  Copper stockpiles tracked by the LME slid for a 14th day
to 357,125 tons today, the lowest level since Oct. 19, 2009,
daily exchange figures showed. Orders to draw copper from LME
inventories, or canceled warrants, dropped 1.9 percent to 31,725
tons.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 2.1 percent to
$24,400 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,500 on Nov. 9. The
metal has jumped 44 percent this year, leading advances on the
exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.  Aluminum rose 0.6 percent to $2,268 a ton and nickel
climbed 2.5 percent to $22,145 a ton. Lead gained 1.8 percent to
$2,225 a ton and zinc added 1.4 percent to $2,115 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
