General Motors Co. , the automaker 33
percent owned by the U.S. Treasury, will invest $163.2 million
at two plants in Michigan and one in Ohio to expand production
of small engines.  The investment will preserve 184 jobs in Flint and Bay
City, Michigan, and Defiance, Ohio, the Detroit-based automaker
said today in a statement. GM will increase output of the 1.4-
liter, four-cylinder engine used in the Chevrolet Cruze compact,
Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid and the replacement of the Chevy Aveo
subcompact.  GM has announced $3.3 billion in investments and created or
retained more than 8,000 jobs since emerging from bankruptcy
last year, according to the statement. The automaker  earned 
$4.77 billion in the first nine months of the year.  “This investment is essential in ensuring we can meet the
expected high demand for the Chevrolet Volt, Chevrolet Cruze and
a small car that will be produced at our Orion Township
facility,” said Kathleen Dilworth, Flint Engine Operations
plant manager.  GM rose 30 cents to $33.55 at 10:15 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have risen 1.7 percent
from their $33 offering price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
