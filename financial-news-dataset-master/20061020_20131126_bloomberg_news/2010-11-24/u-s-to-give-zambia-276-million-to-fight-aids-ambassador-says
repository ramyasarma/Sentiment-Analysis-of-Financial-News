The U.S. will give Zambia $276
million in 2011 to help fight AIDS in the southern African
nation, said Mark Storella, the U.S. ambassador to Zambia.  The two countries signed a five-year partnership agreement
for prevention programs and the treatment and care of people
living with the disease, Storella said today at a signing
ceremony in Lusaka, the capital.  About 14 percent of Zambians aged 15 to 49 are infected
with HIV, Zambian Health Minister Kapembwe Simbao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
