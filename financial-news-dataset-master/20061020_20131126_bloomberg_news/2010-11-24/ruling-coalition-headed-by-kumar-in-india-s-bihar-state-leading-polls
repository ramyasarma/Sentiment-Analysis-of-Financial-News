The ruling coalition in India’s
eastern state of Bihar is leading in the state assembly
elections, signaling a mandate for chief minister  Nitish Kumar ’s development programs in one of the nation’s poorest
provinces.  Kumar’s Janata Dal (United)-led coalition, seeking to
retain power in Bihar, was ahead in 182 of the 243
constituencies for which trends were available, the New Delhi
Television channel reported.  By curbing crime, repairing as many as 5,400 kilometers
(3,375 miles) of national highways and district roads, and
raising spending on education and health in Bihar, Kumar’s
government raised economic growth to an annual average of 10.7
percent in the four years to March 2009, according to the  World
Bank . Expansion averaged 4.5 percent in the previous four-year
period, the bank said.  While Bihar has 8.5 percent of India’s population, it
accounts for 1.6 percent of its gross domestic product, the
World Bank says. Landless farm laborers make nearly half the
workforce, compared to 27 percent nationally. About 52 percent
of its people are illiterate. The state’s per capita income in
the year to March 2008 was a third of the national average.  The Rashtriya Janata Dal-led coalition headed by former
central Railway Minister Lalu Prasad was ahead in 44
constituencies, while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s  Congress
Party  was leading in five, the television channel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
