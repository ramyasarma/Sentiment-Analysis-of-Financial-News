Freeworld Coatings Ltd. , a South
African maker of decorative paints and coatings, said annual
profit increased 6 percent on higher sales of its Plascon paints
and a recovery in the automotive market.  Net income advanced to 150.8 million rand ($21.3 million)
in the twelve months through September, from 142.3 million a
year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Sales rose 2.3 percent to 2.8 billion rand.  A slow return to growth in economies emerging from
recession and weakness in the euro-area following Greece’s
bailout made trading conditions “difficult” during the year,
Freeworld said. Earnings from operations outside South Africa
were lower when converted into the local currency because of the
currency’s strength against the U.S. dollar, it said.  While Freeworld sees signs of economic recovery, “trading
conditions remain constrained and we are still concerned over
global financial markets and the pace of the economic
recovery,” it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
