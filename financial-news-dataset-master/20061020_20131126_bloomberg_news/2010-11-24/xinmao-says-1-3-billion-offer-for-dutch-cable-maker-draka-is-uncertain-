Tianjin Xinmao S&T Investment
Corp. ’s proposed 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) offer for Dutch
cable maker Draka Holding NV needs the Chinese government to
give its nod.  A sale to Xinmao is “uncertain” because of the need for
Chinese government approval, according to a filing from
subsidiary Tianjin Xinmao Technology to the Shenzhen stock
exchange. The filing was posted in Chinese.  Xinmao, based in Tianjin, on Nov. 22 trumped an 840
million-euro offer from  Prysmian SpA , just as Prysmian was
revealing details of the proposed combination with Draka on a
conference call for analysts and investors. Amsterdam-based
Draka said yesterday it will enter talks with Xinmao and
provide some due diligence information to the Chinese investor
with interests in optical wire, cable manufacturing, industrial
real estate, mining and wind energy.  “We don’t expect any problems and we don’t see any
obstacles,” Xinmao’s financial adviser  Joseph Krant  of
Catalyst Advisors said by telephone from Amsterdam today.
“China has a certain regulatory path one has to go.”  The Prysmian combination “is the best fit for Draka,”
Chief Executive Officer  Frank Dorjee  told reporters in Milan
yesterday, before the statement on the Xinmao discussions.  Michael Bosman , a Draka spokesman, declined to provide
details beyond the press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
