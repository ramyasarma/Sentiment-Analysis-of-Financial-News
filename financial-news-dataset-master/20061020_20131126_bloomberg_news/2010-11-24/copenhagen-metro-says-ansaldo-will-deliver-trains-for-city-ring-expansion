Copenhagen’s Metro said Ansaldo STS
SpA won a contract for the City Ring, an expansion of the Danish
capital’s underground train system.  Ansaldo will deliver trains, the rail system and the
operating system and run the operations for the next five years,
Metro said today in a statement on its website without
disclosing the value of Ansaldo’s part of the order. The total
cost of the expansion of the City Ring will be 21.3 billion
kroner.  Ansaldo shares rose as much as 5.8 percent and traded at 
9.59 euros, up 5.3 percent, at 3:20 p.m. in Milan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
