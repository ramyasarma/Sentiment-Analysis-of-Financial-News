Spotlight Retail Group and Spotlight
Property Group, parts of the closely-held Australian  fabric
retailer , are seeking A$570 million ($554 million) of loans to
refinance existing debt, a person familiar with the matter said.  Spotlight Retail, the operating company, is seeking A$200
million of three-year loans and A$100 million of debt due in a
year, while the property manager is seeking A$270 million of
three-year loans, the person said, asking not to be named as the
talks are private. The company has asked banks for submissions
on the margins they are willing to accept, and may set the
interest rates next week, the person said.  Spotlight, Australia’s largest retailer off dress fabrics,
craft and home interior ideas, was founded in the 1970s and now
has stores in Australia, New Zealand and Asia employing more
than 6,700 people, according to information on the company’s

according to the person. Commitments from lenders are due late
next month, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
