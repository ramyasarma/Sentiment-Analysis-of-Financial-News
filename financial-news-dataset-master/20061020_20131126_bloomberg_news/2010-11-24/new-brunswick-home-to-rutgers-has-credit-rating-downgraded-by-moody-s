New Brunswick , New Jersey, home to
Rutgers University and health-products maker  Johnson & Johnson ,
had its credit rating cut by Moody’s Investors Service, which
cited the city’s “limited financial flexibility.”  The one-level downgrade to A2, Moody’s sixth-highest grade,
covers the planned sale next month by the  New Brunswick Parking
Authority  of $183 million of city-guaranteed revenue bonds. It
affects $405 million of existing general-obligation debt and
other guaranteed securities, Moody’s said.  “Constrained revenue-raising capability and narrow current
fund balance of 2.6 percent of current fund revenues, and large
contingent liability created by the sizable amount of city-
guaranteed parking authority debt,” prompted the cut, Moody’s
analysts led by  Josellyn Yousef  wrote in a report today.  The city’s ability to raise revenue is limited by property-
tax caps and high fixed costs for pensions and health benefits,
New York-based Moody’s said.  “New Brunswick’s level of financial flexibility has
significantly weakened since fiscal 2006,” it said.  The city of more than 51,000 in central New Jersey, about
60 miles (100 kilometers) southwest of New York City, holds the
main campus of  Rutgers , the state university. Students make up
about a quarter of its population, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
