Japanese 10-year government  bonds 
fell, pushing yields to the highest level in two months, before
data tomorrow that economists said will show consumer prices
increased for the first time since 2008.  The difference in yield between 10- and 2-year debt widened
to the most in 10 weeks as stocks and commodities gained after
U.S. reports showed employment and consumer sentiment improved.
Bonds also dropped after demand weakened at an auction of 2.6
trillion yen ($31 billion) in two-year notes.  “In the long run, there is the possibility that the market
will start to look at inflation driven by higher commodity
prices,” said  Ayako Sera , who helps oversee about $310 billion
in Tokyo as a strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. “I
expect 1.4 to 1.5 percent is the upper ceiling for 10-year
yields for the next 12 months.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond climbed three basis
points to 1.155 percent as of 4:10 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 fell 0.261 yen to 98.634.
The yield reached the highest since Sept. 14.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.26 to
141.10 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan’s  consumer prices  rose 0.2 percent in October from a
year ago, according to the median economist estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The last increase was in December 2008.  Breakeven Rate  Bond traders have been cutting bets on the amount of
deflation. The breakeven rate, the difference between yields on
inflation-linked bonds and conventional debt, reached minus 0.47
percent on Nov. 22, the least deflation since September 2008.  “Deflation of asset prices is undoubtedly easing
gradually,” said  Susumu Kato , Tokyo-based chief economist for
Japan at Credit Agricole CIB and CLSA.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent today and the
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of raw materials gained 1.6
percent yesterday after the U.S. government said jobless claims
fell to 407,000 last week, compared with the median economist
estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a drop to 435,000. The
Thomson Reuters/ University of Michigan final index of November
consumer sentiment increased to 71.6, the highest since June.  Today’s sale of two-year Japanese notes drew bids valued at
3.19 times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called  bid -
to-cover ratio of 5.54 last month.  Central Bank  Demand for the securities dropped as the yen’s retreat from
a 15-year high against the dollar reduced speculation that the
Bank of Japan will take more steps to ease policy to weaken the
currency, said  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist in Tokyo at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold 10-year debt
over two-year notes was 98.5 basis points, the widest level
since Sept. 14. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Bond losses were limited after the Ministry of Finance said
Japan’s exports rose 7.8 percent in October from a year ago.
Shipments were forecast to increase 10.7 percent, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “When we look at upside and downside risks comprehensively,
downside risks appear to be outweighing the upside risks
slightly,” Bank of Japan board member Seiji Nakamura said today
at a press conference in Fukushima, northern Japan, after the
export figures were released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
