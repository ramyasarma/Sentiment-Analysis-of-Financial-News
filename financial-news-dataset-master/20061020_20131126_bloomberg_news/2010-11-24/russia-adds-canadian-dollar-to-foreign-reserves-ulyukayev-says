Russia added the Canadian dollar
to its international reserves, said  Alexei Ulyukayev , first 
deputy chairman of Russia’s central bank.  “We have recently begun investing in assets denominated in
the Canadian dollar,” Ulyukayev said today in an interview in
Moscow. “So far the amounts are very small, but there’s perhaps
potential for increasing our holdings. We haven’t started
investing in the Australian dollar yet. So far we are just
considering the possibility of including it in the list of
currencies allowed for reserve allocation.”  The Canadian dollar hasn’t yet affected the currency
allocations, Ulyukayev said.  “Within several months we may be able to speak about more
substantial volumes and any changes in the structure” of the
reserves, he said.  Russia’s reserves are made up of 47 percent U.S. dollars,
41 percent euros, 10 percent British pounds and 2 percent
Japanese yen.  “We are considering several other currencies, but we are
looking at them more in a theoretical sense than practical
one,” Ulyukayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
