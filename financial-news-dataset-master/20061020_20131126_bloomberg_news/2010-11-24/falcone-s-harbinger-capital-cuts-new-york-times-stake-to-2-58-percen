Harbinger Capital Partners, the
hedge fund founded by  Philip Falcone , cut its stake in New York
Times Co. to 2.58 percent from 7.41 percent.  Harbinger reduced its holdings to 3.7 million shares
according to  a securities filing  today, down from 10.7 million
shares as of its last filing on Oct. 19. Harbinger had held 28.5
million shares in the company in 2008.  New York Times shares rose this week on heavy trading
volume after a 7-million block trade on Nov. 22 prompted
speculation that  Carlos Slim , the Mexican billionaire who
already owns about 7 percent of the newspaper publisher, had
increased his stake. Times Co. rose 11 percent this week to
close at its highest level since Aug. 2.  Arturo Elias , Slim’s spokesman, said Slim has made no
change in his New York Times stake. Harbinger had not confirmed
that it was the seller until its securities filing today.  Harbinger is under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission over a $113 million loan to Falcone to pay
personal taxes, two people with knowledge of the probe said this
month.  Times Co.  rose 20 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $9.10 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
declined 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
