What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on an extended rebound in demand
for dwindling U.S. supplies following last week’s price decline
to the lowest since Oct. 12, said  Chuck Shelby , the president of
Risk Management Commodities Inc. in Lafayette, Indiana. Soybean-
meal futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is expected to open up 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on demand from makers of livestock feed, food
and fuel after prices dropped yesterday to a six-week low,
Shelby said.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as a rebound in the global economy improves grain
demand and adverse U.S. weather erodes prospects for output,
Shelby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
