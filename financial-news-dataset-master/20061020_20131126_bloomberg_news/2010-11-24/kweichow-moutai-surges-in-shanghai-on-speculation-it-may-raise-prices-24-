Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest
liquor maker by market value, rose the most in two weeks in
Shanghai trading after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. said it
may raise prices as much as 24 percent next month.  Kweichow Moutai gained as much as 9.3 percent to 206.60
yuan, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 10, before trading at
202.50 as of 10:09 a.m. local time.  The baijiu liquor maker may increase prices by between 20
percent and 24 percent in late December, analyst Tong Xun at
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities said in a research note today. The
brokerage set a 12-month share price estimate of 240 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
