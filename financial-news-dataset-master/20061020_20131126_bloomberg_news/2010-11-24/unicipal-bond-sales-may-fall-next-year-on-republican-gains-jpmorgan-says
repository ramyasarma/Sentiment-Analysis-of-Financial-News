U.S. municipal bond sales may fall
next year as Republicans gain greater control over states and
Congress alters the Build America Bonds program,  JPMorgan Chase 
& Co. analysts wrote.  State and local-government bond sales may drop to $395
billion in 2011 from about $415 billion this year,  Alex Roever ,
 Chris Holmes  and  Josh Rudolph  wrote in a report to clients
today. Sales may fall by another $50 billion if the Build
America Bonds program isn’t extended beyond its scheduled
expiration at the end of the year, they wrote.  The volume of new bonds may decline as the subsidy paid by
the federal government on Build America Bonds interest is cut to
32 percent from 35 percent, as proposed in a bill pending in the
Senate, the New York-based analysts said.  A backlash against government borrowing may also lower bond
issuance, the report said. Republicans advocating spending
restraint won control of a majority of U.S. governorships and
full power over  25 legislatures  in the Nov. 2 election.  “Intensifying scrutiny of the wide deficits and ominous
debt loads of sovereign governments has made excess borrowing
taboo,” the analysts wrote. “After gaining substantial
standing in state Congresses, the Republican influence is widely
expected to dampen the marginal propensity to borrow.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
