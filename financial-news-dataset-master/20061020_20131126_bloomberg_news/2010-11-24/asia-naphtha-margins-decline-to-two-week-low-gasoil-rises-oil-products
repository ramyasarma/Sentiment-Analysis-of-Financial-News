Naphtha refining margins in Asia
declined to the lowest in two weeks while those for fuel oil and
gasoil rose amid a diesel shortage in China.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $768 a
metric ton against offers at $771, according to brokerage Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte. First-half February cargoes were bid at
$764.50 a ton compared with offers at $767.50, data from Ginga
Petroleum showed.  Prices  for mid-January to mid-February delivery fell 2.3
percent to $770.25 a ton yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan naphtha’s difference to Brent crude, or the crack
spread, dropped to $137 a ton from $138.83 at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s
the smallest gap since Nov. 9.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude, or the crack spread, rose
for the first time in a week to $13.13 a barrel from $12.97
yesterday, according to brokerage PVM Oil Associates. December
 swaps for gasoil , or diesel, gained 10 cents to $94.30 a barrel.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil rose to $1.25 a barrel
from $1.10 yesterday. A wider regrade indicates that aviation
fuel is more profitable to produce compared with diesel.  China fined five oil companies including units of
PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., the
country’s biggest refiners, for selling diesel above state-set
prices amid a fuel shortage in the country, the National
Development and Reform Commission said in a statement on its
website yesterday.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
losses, narrowed to $7.06 a barrel from $7.19 yesterday, PVM
data showed. December high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps  rose 50 cents
to $481.75 a ton, PVM data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
