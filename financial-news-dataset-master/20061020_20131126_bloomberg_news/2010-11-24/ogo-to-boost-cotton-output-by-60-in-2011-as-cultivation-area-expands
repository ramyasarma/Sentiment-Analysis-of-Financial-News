Togo  plans to increase cotton
production by 60 percent next year, as farmers widen the area
under cultivation to take advantage of climbing international
prices for the fiber, according to the main growers’ group.  Output will climb to 80,000 metric tons in 2011 from 50,000
tons this year, said Baba Djabakatie, general secretary of the
Togolese Cotton Producers’ Federation.  International cotton prices, which have soared 49 percent
this year, are “increasing growers’ interest” in planting the
fiber, Djabakatie said in an e-mailed response to questions
yesterday. Togo, which borders Africa’s top cotton grower
Burkina Faso, has been trying to boost output by expanding
cultivation and giving farmers a stake in the New Togo Cotton
Co., formed last year after the wholly state-owned cotton
company was liquidated.  Farmers are able to participate in the management of the
new company, said Djabakatie, whose organization encompasses
about 300,000 growers and their mainly small-scale farms of two
hectares or less.  Togolese farmers will plant “at least” 90,000 hectares
(222,394 acres) of cotton next year, an increase over the 60,000
hectares cultivated this year, he said. The price farmers will
receive for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cotton will be increased
to 185 CFA francs ($0.37), from 175 francs, Djabakatie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
