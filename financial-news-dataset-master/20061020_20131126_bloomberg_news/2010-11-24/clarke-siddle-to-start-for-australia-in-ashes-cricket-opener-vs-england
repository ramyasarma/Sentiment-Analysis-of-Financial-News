Australia batsman  Michael Clarke  is
fit for tomorrow’s series-opening Ashes cricket Test in Brisbane
and Peter Siddle was chosen ahead of fellow fast bowler Doug
Bollinger, captain  Ricky Ponting  said.  Bollinger and Usman Khawaja, who had been called into the
squad as backup because Clarke has been struggling with a back
injury, will be released from the 13-man squad to play for their
state teams following the toss, Ponting said.  “Michael Clarke’s got through his work particularly well
the last couple of days,” Ponting said at a news conference at
Brisbane’s Gabba stadium. “Dougie’s the unlucky quick to miss
out.”  Siddle, who hasn’t played a Test since January because of a
stress fracture in his back, will team with Mitchell Johnson 
and  Ben Hilfenhaus  in the same pace attack that played all five
Tests in last year’s 2-1 Ashes series defeat in England.  Left-arm spin bowler Xavier Doherty will make his Test
debut.  Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Shane Watson, Simon
Katich, Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Mike Hussey, Marcus
North, Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Xavier
Doherty, Ben Hilfenhaus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
