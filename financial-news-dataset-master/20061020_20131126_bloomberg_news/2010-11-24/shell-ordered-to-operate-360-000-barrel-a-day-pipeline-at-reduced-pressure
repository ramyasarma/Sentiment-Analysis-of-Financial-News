Royal Dutch Shell Plc  must reduce
operating pressure on its  360,000-barrel-a-day pipeline  from
Houma, Louisiana, to Houston by 20 percent, under a corrective-
action order issued yesterday by U.S. regulators.  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
found that the company failed to identify an indication of
corrosion during a 2007 inspection of the pipeline, according to
the order. The pipeline was shut after it leaked about 1,000
barrels of oil Nov. 16.  “There is valid cause for concern about other potential
sites along the affected pipeline that may have been assessed in
a similar manner and should be re-evaluated and investigated for
the threat of failure,” the agency said in the order.  The cause of the failure isn’t known and the investigation
is ongoing, according to the order. Preliminary assessments by
Shell and PHMSA “indicate that the cause of the failure may
have been external corrosion,” according to the order.  Shell was in the process of restarting the line, Bill
Tanner, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. He
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail today asking the status
of the line.  The conduit, known as the Ho-Ho pipeline system, makes
deliveries to refineries in Texas and Louisiana with a combined
daily capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The segment that failed was constructed in 1952, according
to PHMSA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
