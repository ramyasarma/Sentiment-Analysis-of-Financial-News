Seventeen people were killed in
Yemen in a suicide car bombing that targeted the Shiite Muslim
Houthi rebel group in a northern province in the Arabian
Peninsula country.  A car packed with explosives detonated alongside a crowd of
Houthis during a religious ceremony in al-Jawf, Mohammed
Abdulsalam, a spokesman for the group, said in a phone interview
today. The group is investigating the attack, which also wounded
five people, he said.  The country’s Supreme Security Committee condemned the
bombing, saying in a statement that it “targeted the security
and stability of innocent people.” Security forces are
investigating, according to the committee statement.  The Houthis, so-called because of the family name of their
leaders, began fighting the government in the northern province
of Saada in 2004. Authorities accuse them of seeking to re-
install the rule of Zaidi Shiite religious leaders that ended in
1962.  The Houthis claim discrimination by Yemen’s majority Sunni
Muslims. Several cease-fires have collapsed because of mistrust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
