Two dead civilians were found on the
island shelled by North Korea, the South Korean coast guard said.  The bodies were those of two men, estimated to be in their
60s, and were found near a construction site for a South Korean
military building on Yeonpyeong island about 3 p.m. local time
today, said an official at the coast guard who declined to be
named, citing government policy.  The men, who were part of a crew of 12 construction workers,
did not live on the island, the official said.  Two soldiers were also killed by the shelling yesterday and
20 people were injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
