Wheat prices rose the most this week
as signs of a rebound in the global economy improved prospects
for grain demand and adverse weather threatened yields in the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Americans filed the fewest unemployment claims in more than
two years and U.S. consumer spending increased for a fifth month
in October, government reports showed today, bolstering optimism
in the recovery. Germany’s business confidence jumped to a
record this month. About 47 percent of the U.S. wheat crop was
in good or excellent condition as of Nov. 21, compared with 64
percent a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said.  “Uncertainty about the health of the U.S. crop may help to
boost demand” as the economy gains momentum, said Chuck Shelby,
the president of Risk Management Commodities Inc. in Lafayette,
Indiana.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.8425 a bushel at 11:01 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest gain since
Nov. 18. Before today, futures gained 26 percent this year.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
