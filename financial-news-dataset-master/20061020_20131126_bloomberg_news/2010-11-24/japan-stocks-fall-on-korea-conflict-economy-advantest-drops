Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
fell the most in more than a week after Standard & Poor’s cut
Ireland’s debt rating, boosting concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will slow a global economic recovery.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank
by market value, dropped 1.9 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s three largest carmakers,
fell at least 0.9 percent each as the euro weakened to a two-
month low against the yen, damping the outlook for export
earnings.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. , a maker of semiconductor
equipment that gets 16 percent of its revenue from South Korea,
retreated 2.1 percent after North Korea attacked South Korea
yesterday, when Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.  “Unless it becomes clearer that things will improve,
concerns will remain and that will slow investment activities,”
said  Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank
Ltd., which manages about $57 billion.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 10,030.11 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo, its biggest drop since Nov. 12. The
broader  Topix  index lost 1 percent to 866.57, with all of its 33
industry groups retreating.  The Nikkei 225 increased 9.9 percent this month to
yesterday, the most among 88 national equity benchmarks tracked
by Bloomberg. Stocks in the Japanese gauge are valued at 17.8
times estimated  earnings  on average, compared with 13.9 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 11.8 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Ireland Debt  Mitsubishi UFJ sank 1.9 percent to 405 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 2 bank by market value, lost
2.5 percent to 2,590 yen and was today’s most  actively traded
stock  by value in the country. Toyota dropped 0.9 percent to
3,270 yen. Honda fell 1.8 percent to 3,065 yen. Nissan retreated
2.1 percent to 787 yen.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc., a maker of imaging equipment
that counts Europe as its biggest market, slumped 1.5 percent to
897 yen.  Olympus Corp. , an optical-instrument maker that derives
more than 20 percent of its sales from Europe, lost 0.6 percent
to 2,357 yen. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions and
which gets 23 percent of its sales from Europe, retreated 2.1
percent to 2,871 yen.  Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating of Ireland’s debt by
two steps today with a negative outlook, as the nation’s bailout
of its banking system is set to escalate the government’s
borrowing needs.  Yen Hurts Exporters  The yen appreciated to 110.75 against the euro at about
1:40 a.m. in Tokyo, its strongest level since Sept. 16. That
reduces the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Tokyo Electron retreated 2.1 percent to 5,150 yen.
Advantest Corp., which is the world’s biggest maker of memory-
chip testers and gets more than 25 percent of its revenue from
South Korea, slumped 1 percent to 1,700 yen. Shin-Etsu Chemical
Co., a maker of silicon wafers, lost 2 percent to 4,130 yen.
South Korea is the home of Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s
biggest chipmaker.  North Korea fired artillery shells yesterday at the South
Korean island of Yeonpyeong near the disputed border between the
two countries, killing two soldiers and setting houses ablaze in
the worst attack on its neighbor in at least eight months.  South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets as
President  Lee Myung Bak  vowed to respond “sternly.” The clash
came 11 days after North Korea showed a uranium-enrichment plant
to visiting U.S. scientists.  Korean Conflict  “Japan will be adversely affected because it’s right in
the center of the conflict,” said  Jamie Coutts , sales manager
at the brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore. “North Korea has
spoken about targeting Japan in the past. Any escalation in
tensions over there directly affects Japan, probably more than
any country in the region other than South Korea itself.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific  excluding Japan  Index dropped 2.1
percent yesterday, the most since June. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in the U.S. retreated 1.4 percent, its biggest slump
in a week, and more than 15 times as many stocks declined as
advanced.  Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s biggest commodities trader, lost
1.4 percent to 2,115 yen.  Mitsui & Co. , which counts commodities
as its largest source of profit, dropped 0.8 percent to 1,330
yen. Inpex Corp., Japan’s No. 1 oil explorer, sank 2.1 percent
to 438,000 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. retreated 1.3
percent to 3,060 yen.  Lunch Break  Crude oil for January delivery lost 0.6 percent yesterday
in New York to settle at $81.25 a barrel, and copper futures
dropped 1.1 percent. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1.6
percent yesterday. Gold futures jumped 1.5 percent, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 4.  Sojitz Corp., a trading company, surged 9.1 percent to 168
yen, the  biggest gain  in the Nikkei 225. Sojitz agreed with
Australia’s Lynas Corp. on a contract to supply Japan with rare-
earth products.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange plans to shorten its 90-minute
lunch break to 1 hour in the first half of next year to boost
revenue, Atsushi Saito, the bourse’s president, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
