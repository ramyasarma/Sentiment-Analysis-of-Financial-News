VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest
lender, may buy the Moscow city government’s stake in Bank of
Moscow, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  “The question of VTB buying the Bank of Moscow shares is
under discussion. No decision has been made,” Kudrin told
reporters in Moscow today. “We’re interested in the whole
stake, 46 percent.”  The Bank of Moscow, which is 64 percent-owned by the city’s
government both directly and indirectly, had its ratings outlook
cut to negative by Fitch Ratings on Sept. 29, the day after
President  Dmitry Medvedev  fired  Yury Luzhkov  as mayor of Moscow.
Fitch cited concern that companies affiliated with the Luzhkov
administration that have backed the bank may no longer provide
support.  New Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  may appoint representatives from
state-run VTB Group to the board of Bank of Moscow at an
extraordinary meeting of the lender’s shareholders next week,
Kommersant reported today.  VTB executives including First Deputy Chairman  Mikhail Kuzovlev  may be invited to take up seats on the board vacated by
officials from Luzhkov’s administration, the newspaper reported,
citing an unidentified person close to Sobyanin.  The federal government plans to sell a 10 percent stake in
VTB this year.  The government may sell 35.5 percent minus one share of VTB
under a plan for 2011-2013, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina 
said on Nov. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
