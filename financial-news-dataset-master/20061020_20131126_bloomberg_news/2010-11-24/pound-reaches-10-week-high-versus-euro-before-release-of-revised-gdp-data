Gilts fell, snapping a three-day
advance, as gains in stocks and better-than-forecast U.S.
economic data sapped demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year yields rose to within six basis points of their
highest since July. The FTSE 100 Index of U.K. shares gained 1.4
percent. The  economy  grew 0.8 percent in third quarter, revised
data from the Office for National Statistics showed today,
double the initial estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. U.S. jobless claims fell to the fewest since 2008. German
bonds fell after the government sold less than the maximum
amount of new debt offered.  “Today’s gilt moves have been following the German and
U.S. markets,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in London. “Clearly the European figures were
strong and equity markets positive and that might have had the
opposite effect on the bonds.”  The yield on the U.K. 10-year gilt climbed seven basis
points to 3.33 percent as of 5:11 p.m. in London. It reached
3.42 percent on Nov. 19, the highest since July 29. The two-year
note yield added four basis points to 1 percent, after yesterday
falling below 1 percent for the first time since Nov. 10.  The yield on the German 10-year bond jumped 11 basis points
as it sold 4.8 billion euros ($6.4 billion) of 2.5 percent
January 2021 bonds at an average yield of 2.59 percent,
attracting bids worth 1.2 times the amount issued. It planned to
sell as much as 6 billion euros of the bonds.  British Pledge  The pound traded at 84.65 pence per euro after reaching
84.29, the strongest since Sept. 21. Sterling traded at $1.5789.
It earlier weakened 0.2 percent to $1.5742, its lowest level
against the U.S. currency since Oct. 27.  Analysts at BNP Paribas SA said the pound may decline
against the dollar as the U.K. government’s proposed 7 billion-
pound assistance loan to Ireland highlights the risks that
British banks may lose money on their Irish activities. U.K.
financial institutions have the world’s largest quantity of
Irish assets, totaling more than $222 billion at the end of the
first quarter, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.  The U.K. currency has weakened 3.7 percent against a basket
of its developed-country peers this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, making it the third-
worst-performing currency after the euro and Norwegian krone.  Gilts have returned 7.5 percent this year, compared with a
7.9 percent gain for German bonds and U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
