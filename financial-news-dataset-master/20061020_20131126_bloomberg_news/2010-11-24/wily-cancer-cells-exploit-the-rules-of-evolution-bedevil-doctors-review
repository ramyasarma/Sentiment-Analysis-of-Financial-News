In 1990, on a windswept plain in
southern Peru, a scientist studying a gravesite of the ancient
Chiribaya tribe discovered the mummified remains of a woman with
a “hard bulbous mass” in her upper left arm.  The paleo-pathologist had stumbled upon the well-preserved
evidence of a 1,000-year-old malignant bone tumor, or
osteosarcoma, writes  Siddhartha Mukherjee  in “ The Emperor of
All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer .”  “The woman must have wondered about the insolent gnaw of
pain in her bone, and the bulge slowly emerging from her arm,”
he writes. “It is hard to look at the tumor and not come away
with the feeling that one has encountered a powerful monster in
its infancy.”  While cancer is among the oldest diseases known to humanity
-- the earliest cases may go back 4,000 years -- it was also
exceedingly rare in the ancient world, mostly because few people
lived long enough to contract it.  Mukherjee, a cancer physician and researcher at  Columbia
University Medical Center  in New York, has chronicled the
history of an illness that has fascinated, bedeviled and humbled
doctors, philosophers and patients alike. He looks the monster
in the eye and aims to know it, moving beyond history into the
realm of biography.  It’s “an attempt to enter the mind of this immortal
illness, to understand its personality, to demystify its
behavior,” Mukherjee writes. Ultimately, he wants to know
whether this disease can be vanquished.  Elegant Prose  At 470 pages, not counting the extensive notes and index,
this isn’t a breezy book; and for those who are well-read in the
subject, some of it may be familiar. Mukherjee’s elegant prose
animates the science and captures our interest, however, as we
meet patients, activists and researchers.  There’s  Sidney Farber , the father of modern chemotherapy, a
pathologist who toils in the basement at Children’s Hospital in
Boston and, beginning in 1947, looks for a cure for childhood
leukemia. And there’s socialite  Mary Woodard Lasker , a Radcliffe
College graduate, who joins forces with Farber to wage “war”
on cancer, merging the powers of science and political lobbying.  The researchers, physicians and activists who do battle
with cancer are undaunted as they try to thwart their wily
enemy, which “exploits the fundamental logic of evolution
unlike any other illness.” Yet Mukherjee wisely knows who the
real heroes are.  Beating the Odds  We meet Mukherjee’s patient Carla Reed, a 30-year-old
kindergarten teacher with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in the
book’s prologue, sitting on her hospital bed with “peculiar
calm.” Mukherjee tells Reed her chance of being cured through
chemotherapy is 30 percent. As Reed begins her treatments, we
experience her inner turmoil:  “For Carla, the physical isolation of those days became a
barely concealed metaphor for a much deeper, fiercer loneliness,
a psychological quarantine even more achingly painful than her
actual confinement,” the author writes.  Mukherjee is quite certain Carla won’t be alive by the time
he completes his tome and she will provide his story’s ending.
He’s wrong; she has gone into remission.  Fewer people are dying of cancer, thanks to genetic
screening, early detection and treatments that range from
chemotherapy to radical prophylactic mastectomy.  If a woman living in 500 B.C. with Hodgkin’s disease could
time-travel to the 21st century, she would gain 30 or 40 years
in life expectancy, Mukherjee says. However, if that same woman
had metastatic pancreatic cancer, modern medicine might buy her
only a few more months.  Curing cancer may not be possible because of its
unpredictability, Mukherjee concedes, and “we might as well
focus on prolonging life rather than eliminating death. This War
on Cancer may best be ‘won’ by redefining victory.”  “The Emperor of All Maladies” is published by  Scribner
