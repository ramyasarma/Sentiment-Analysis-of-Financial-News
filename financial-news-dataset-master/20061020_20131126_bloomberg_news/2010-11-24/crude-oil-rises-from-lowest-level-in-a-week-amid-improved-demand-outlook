Oil fluctuated in New York after a
a downgrade to Ireland’s debt rating weakened the euro against
the dollar, denting demand for commodities, while traders bet a
report will show U.S. crude consumption is rising.  Oil trimmed a gain of as much as 0.8 percent as the dollar
strengthened following Standard & Poor’s lowering of Ireland’s
rating by two steps. U.S. crude inventories probably declined 2
million barrels, or 0.6 percent, last week from 357.6 million a
week earlier, according to a Bloomberg News survey before an
Energy Department report today. Yesterday an industry-funded
report showed supplies grew.  “The physical oil market is improving, but slowly,” said
Thina Saltvedt, a Nordea Bank AB commodities analyst in Olso.
“Even though inventories are moving down, they’re still quite
high, and we don’t expect a large upswing in U.S. demand.”  Crude for January delivery traded at $81.61 a barrel, 36
cents higher in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 1:16 p.m. London time. It earlier gained as much
as 63 cents to $81.88 a barrel. Brent crude for January
settlement rose as much as 69 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$83.94 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar also erased a decline versus the euro to trade
0.4 percent higher at $1.3315. The U.S. currency earlier
weakened as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3419.  The American Petroleum Institute reported late yesterday
that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles increased 5.19 million barrels to
357.7 million.  Gasoline Dropped  The industry funded group said gasoline supplies dropped
499,000 barrels to 214.1 million. Distillate fuel inventories,
including diesel and kerosene, fell by 311,000 barrels to 157.3
million barrels.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary
basis  from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction eight of the past nine weeks. The DOE report is
scheduled to be released at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  U.S. crude stockpiles probably dropped to their lowest
level in three months as refinery demand increased with the end
of seasonal maintenance, according to the median of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Oil has dropped 7.9 percent after reaching its highest
level this year on Nov. 11.  “On a price standpoint, we’ve come down quite a bit very
quickly so we are finding support around $80,” said  Anthony Nunan , an assistant general manager for risk management at
Mitsubishi Corp. in Tokyo. “It got cheap enough that people are
buying. If you look at overall inventories, directionally it’s
been good.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
