Copper and zinc advanced for the
first time in four days as concern over the artillery-fire
exchange between North and South Korea eased, pushing down the
dollar. Aluminum, lead, nickel and tin gained.  Three-month delivery copper increased as much as 1.8
percent to $8,289.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $8,285 a ton at 3:34 p.m. in Shanghai. The
metal dropped 3.4 percent in the past three days. Zinc gained
2.8 percent to $2,144 a ton after a decline of 4.6 percent.  The United Nations said in an e-mailed statement that UN
Commander  Walter Sharp  proposed to North Korea’s military to
hold talks between officers at the rank of general over the
country’s shelling of a South Korean island. The dollar fell for
the first time in three days against the euro.  “The U.S. dollar is an important factor that moves copper
prices these days,” Xu Maili, an analyst at Donghai Futures Co.,
said in Shanghai.  Investors bought traditionally safer assets, like the
dollar, after the exchange of artillery fire yesterday, and as
the situation isn’t worsening today, the weakening dollar
supported buying of metals, Xu said.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
six major trading partners, reached an eight-week high at 79.743
yesterday, and declined as much as 0.3 percent to 79.435 today.  South Korea has raised its military surveillance alert to
the second-highest level after North Korea fired shells into its
military base on Yeonpyeong Island, Defense Minister Kim Tae
Young told lawmakers in Seoul.  U.S. Economy  Copper for March delivery in Shanghai closed 1.6 percent
higher at 62,480 yuan ($9,395) a ton. The most active contract
tumbled to 60,920 yuan a ton yesterday, the lowest level since
Oct. 8. Zinc gained 2.4 percent to close at 17,620 yuan per ton,
rallying from 17,125 yuan, the lowest price since Sept. 30.  The LME index of six industrial metals declined to 3,640.1
yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 27.  Most officials at the Nov. 2-3 Fed meeting expected the
purchase of $600 billion of Treasuries “to help promote a
somewhat stronger recovery in output and employment while also
helping return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with”
the Fed’s legislative mandate, the Open Market Committee said.  “The U.S. economic condition maybe better than we
expected,”  Zeng Chao , an analyst at Everbright Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai.  Chile Strike  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, more than the 2 percent previously calculated, as
companies increased shipments abroad and Americans boosted
spending. A separate report showed purchases of existing homes
decreased 2.2 percent to a 4.43 million annual rate, the
National Association of Realtors said.  Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi venture
said it will ignore union calls to resume wage talks and
continue negotiating directly with workers in a bid to end a
strike at the world’s fourth-biggest copper mine.  Collahuasi in northern Chile extended an offer of 14
million pesos ($29,313) in bonuses and low-interest loans until
Nov. 26 from yesterday’s deadline because it is yet to contact
all workers, said Bernardita Fernandez, a company spokeswoman.
The deal will be cut to 12 million pesos on Nov. 27, she said.  Aluminum in London gained 1.8 percent to $2,296 a ton, lead
added 1.4 percent to $2,217.25 a ton and nickel climbed 1.1
percent to $21,840 a ton. Tin was little changed at $23,850.  -- Helen Sun . Editor: James Poole  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
