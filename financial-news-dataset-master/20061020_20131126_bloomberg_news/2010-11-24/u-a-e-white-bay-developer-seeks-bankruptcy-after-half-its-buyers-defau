Al-Murjan Real Estate LLC, a United
Arab Emirates company building a $3 billion residential
community, became the country’s first developer to file for
bankruptcy since the financial crisis began.  The owner of White Bay, an 8,000-home community in the
emirate of Umm Al-Quwain, filed for bankruptcy in a federal
court and two liquidators have been appointed following a
lawsuit brought by one of the owners, according to documents
provided to Bloomberg by Ludmila Yamalova, a partner at HPL
 Yamalova & Plewka JLT  representing three buyers in White Bay.  The developer, equally owned by Umm Al-Quwain’s deputy
ruler, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid  Al Mualla , and Al Khalijia
Investments LLC, cited failure to get government approval for
the project and defaults by “nearly 50 percent of the buyers.”  The financial crisis has driven property prices down across
the U.A.E. Values slid by more than 30 percent in Abu Dhabi and
60 percent in Dubai, leading to the cancellation of half of all
planned property projects there.  “Buyers want the project to go ahead and want to know the
real reason for liquidation,” Yamalova said. “They can’t
understand how the Sheikh can’t get his own administrative
agency to grant him approvals.”  The buyers represented by Yamalova have already paid about
50 percent of the price of their properties, she said.  Al-Murjan Real Estate didn’t immediately respond to
questions when contacted by Bloomberg today. The Financial Times
reported the bankruptcy plan earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
