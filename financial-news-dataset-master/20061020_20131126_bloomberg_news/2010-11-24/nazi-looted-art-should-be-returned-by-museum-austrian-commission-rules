Austria’s Leopold Museum should
return seven Nazi-looted paintings by  Egon Schiele  and Anton
Romako to their rightful owners, said an art commission set up
by the country’s Ministry of Culture.  Five  Schiele  paintings and two Romako works should be
returned, the ministry said yesterday on its  website . The
paintings had belonged to Maurice Eisler and Karl Maylaender,
both Jews persecuted by Nazis, according to the commission. The
decision is non-binding.  The Leopold Museum, which paid $19 million earlier this
year to settle a Schiele restitution case, has said it wants to
complete research into the provenance of its entire art works by
the end of the year. Diethard Leopold, the chair of the museum’s
foundation, estimates that up to 50 works may be affected.  Leopold Museum spokesman Klaus Pokorny didn’t immediately
return a telephone call and e-mail message seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
