Cotton futures rebounded from the
biggest three-session slump since 2008 on signs of resilient
demand from China, the world’s biggest consumer. Orange juice
fell.  In China, cotton output may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, Cncotton.com, a research company, has said. Before today,
futures dropped 26 percent from a record $1.5195 a pound on
Nov. 10.  “Prices look quite good compared to what they looked like
two weeks ago,” said  John Flanagan , the president of Flanagan
Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. The rebound
signals “a dawning reality that we probably still need more
cotton,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery rose 3.61 cents, or 3.2 percent,
to $1.1514 at 10:42 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. In the
previous three sessions, the price dropped 13 percent, the most
since March 2008.  Demand in China is forecast to outpace supplies by 17
million bales in the year ending July 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has forecast.  Before today, cotton advanced 48 percent this year amid
surging demand from China and plunging  inventories  in the U.S.,
the leading exporter. A bale weighs about 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  “I can see supplies remaining tight next year in China,”
said  Gary Raines , an economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in
Nashville, Tennessee.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 0.85 cent,
or 0.6 percent, to $1.517 a pound. Before today, the commodity
gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
