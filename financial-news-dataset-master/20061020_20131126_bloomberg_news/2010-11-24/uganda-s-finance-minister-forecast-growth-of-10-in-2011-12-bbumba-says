Uganda’s economy will expand about
10 percent in the year through June 2012, Finance Minister Syda
Bbumba said.  “We are pursuing good economic policies which will see the
economy grow,” Bbumba said today in an interview in the
capital, Kampala.  Growth will be driven by the service and construction
industries,  Keith Muhakanizi , the deputy secretary to the
Treasury, said in a separate interview. The forecast for
expansion next year compares with the 6.4 percent that Bbumba
projected on June 10 for the 2010-11 fiscal year.  Uganda, with a population of 32 million people, will become
an oil producer later this year when  Tullow Oil Plc  starts
production at its Kasamene field. The East African nation is
trying to reduce its reliance on foreign donor aid, which
accounts for about 4.6 percent of gross domestic product,
according to World Bank data.  Tullow, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in Africa,
plans a partnership with France’s Total SA and China National
Offshore Oil Corp. to help develop Uganda’s oilfields. Neptune
Uganda Ltd., a unit of the London-based Tower Resources Plc, and
Dominion Petroleum Ltd. of Bermuda are the other companies
exploring for oil in Uganda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
