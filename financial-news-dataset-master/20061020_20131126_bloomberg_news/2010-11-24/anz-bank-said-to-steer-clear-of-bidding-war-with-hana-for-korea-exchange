Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd.  won’t make a counter-bid for a stake in  Korea
Exchange Bank  after Hana Financial Group Inc. offered as much as
$4.2 billion, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  ANZ Bank won’t enter a bidding war with Hana, South Korea’s
fourth-largest financial company, said the person, who declined
to be identified before a statement from the Melbourne-based
lender that may come tomorrow.  Hana will sign a contract tomorrow to buy 51 percent of
Korea Exchange Bank from Lone Star Funds for as much as 4.75
trillion won ($4.2 billion), Hana said today. ANZ Bank had been
carrying out due diligence on Korea Exchange Bank, the nation’s
fifth-biggest lender, since at least August.  “We’ll make an announcement after Hana and Lone Star sign
an agreement,” said Stephen Ries, a spokesman for ANZ Bank. He
declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
