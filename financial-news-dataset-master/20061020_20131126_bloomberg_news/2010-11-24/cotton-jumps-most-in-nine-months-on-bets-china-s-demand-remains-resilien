Cotton futures rose the most in nine
months on signs of resilient demand from China, the world’s
biggest consumer. Orange juice was unchanged.  In China, cotton output may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, Cncotton.com, a research company, has said. In the
previous three sessions, prices tumbled 13 percent, the most
since March 2008. On Nov. 10, the fiber surged to a record
$1.5195 a pound.  “Prices look quite good compared to what they looked like
two weeks ago,” said  John Flanagan , the president of Flanagan
Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. The rebound
signals “a dawning reality that we probably still need more
cotton,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery rose 4.8 cents, or 4.3 percent,
to settle at $1.1659 at 2:59 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Feb. 9.
U.S. markets will be closed tomorrow for the Thanksgiving
holiday.  Demand in China is forecast to outpace supplies by 17
million bales in the year ending July 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has forecast. A bale weighs about 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  Cotton futures have jumped 54 percent this year amid
surging demand from China and plunging  inventories  in the U.S.,
the leading exporter.  “I can see supplies remaining tight next year in China,”
said  Gary Raines , an economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in
Nashville, Tennessee.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery closed at $1.5255
a pound. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 1.5 percent. The
commodity has gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
