Thai Airways International Pcl  plans
to order 37 new aircraft to replace aging planes and expand
routes, President  Piyasvasti Amranand  said.  The new jets will begin operation by the end of 2017,
Piyasvasti told analysts in Bangkok, according to a  presentation 
of the meeting posted on the Stock Exchange of Thailand’s
website today. Thai Airways earlier placed a separate order for
26 new aircraft for delivery by 2013, Piyasvasti said.  Piyasvasti, Thailand’s former energy minister, is shopping
for planes after cutting expenses and restructuring debt to help
revive state-controlled Thai Airways after a record  loss  in
2008. The carrier raised about 15 billion baht ($499 million)
from a share sale to existing shareholders in September to
strengthen its finances.  “Thai Airways’ biggest problem is the limited fleet
capacity to serve its increasing passenger load,” said
Piyasvasti. “Most of its aircraft are also very old, making it
hard to compete with other airlines.”  The airline still hasn’t determined which models it will
buy from either  Boeing Co.  or Airbus SAS, he said. The company
plans to replace 32 older aircraft between 2013 and 2017, he
said.  Thai Airways  surged 8.8 percent to 49.50 baht at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok, the highest since November 2006.  The carrier’s fleet will increase to 105 by the end of 2017
from 84, Piyasvasti said. The new planes will cut the average
age of its fleet to about 8 years from 11 years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
