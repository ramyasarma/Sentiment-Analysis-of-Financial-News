Treasuries dropped before the
government’s $29 billion seven-year note auction as U.S. initial
jobless claims fell more than forecast to the lowest level since
July 2008.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note rose for the first
time in four days as the jobless claims report reinforced
evidence the labor market is healing. A gain in stocks reduced
demand for the safety of U.S. government debt. Today’s sale
completes $99 billion in Treasury note auctions this week.  “The jobless claims contributed to the weakness in the
market,” said  James Combias , New York-based head of Treasury
trading at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., one of 18 primary
dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “We have supply
today and it’s a thin market.”  The 10-year note yield increased 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 2.88 percent at 10:49 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 dropped 27/32, or
$8.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 27/32. The yield dropped
yesterday to 2.73 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 12.  Economic Recovery  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 1.3 percent in its
first advance in three days.  Jobless claims declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week
ended Nov. 20, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000.  “It’s not surprising 10s want to test support at 2.85
percent,”  Jim Vogel , head of agency debt research at FTN
Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a note to clients. The
weekly claims are well under expectations and as close to
400,000 as seen in several years, Vogel wrote.  Consumer spending rose in October for a fifth month as a
rebound in incomes lifted the biggest part of the U.S. economy
at the start of the final quarter of 2010.  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.3
percent gain in September that was larger than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today. Incomes
climbed 0.5 percent and the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure
of inflation was little changed, capping the smallest 12-month
gain since records began five decades ago.  New Home purchases decreased 8.1 percent in October to a
283,000 annual rate, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today in Washington. The median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News projected an increase to a 312,000 annual
pace. Sales reached a 275,000 pace in August, the lowest since
data collection began in 1963.  Note Sales  The seven-year notes being sold today yielded 2.22
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.97 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on Oct. 28.  Investors bid for 3.06 times the amount offered last month,
compared with an average of 2.90 for the past 10 auctions.
Indirect bidders purchased 50.2 percent of the securities,
compared with the 10-sale average of 49.4 percent.  A $35 billion five-year auction yesterday attracted  bids 
for 2.65 times the amount available, the lowest since June.
Indirect bidders bought 31.5 percent of the notes.  Treasuries have returned 7.9 percent this year, compared
with 3 percent for the debt of nations that share the euro,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. debt is
benefiting from its status as a haven from financial and
political turbulence. They climbed yesterday as North and South
Korea exchanged artillery fire.  Fed Deliberations  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Nov. 2-3
meeting released yesterday showed some policy makers raised
their long-run jobless-rate projections for the U.S.  “The Fed is concerned about the fundamental evolution in
the economy, and if the data confirms such an assessment, the
bullish tone can persist and gain momentum,” said  Patrick Jacq ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities known as the
break-even rate, was 2.14 percentage points today, down from
this year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January.  Treasuries rose earlier as Ireland’s credit-rating cut
added to concern the global economic recovery will falter,
fueling demand for the safest assets.  S&P cut Ireland’s long-term rating to A from AA- and the
short-term grade to A-1 from A-1+. The reduction leaves its
long-term grade five steps above Greece, which has the highest
junk, or high-risk, grade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
