Danone , the world’s biggest yogurt
maker, said it agreed to buy YoCream International Inc., a U.S.
producer of frozen yogurt, for $103 million, adding distribution
networks for restaurants and convenience stores.  Danone is offering about $39.82 in cash for each share,
YoCream said in a statement. That’s 39 percent higher than the
Portland, Oregon-based company’s most recent closing price.
Danone expects to conclude the sale this year, the Paris-based
company said on its  website  today.  “Danone is shoring up its presence in dairy products in a
high value-added segment -- U.S. distribution networks outside
the home,”  Francis Pretre , an analyst at CM-CIC Securitie, wrote
in a note today. He has a “hold” rating on the stock.  The acquisition follows Danone’s June agreement to purchase
a controlling stake in Russian dairy-product maker OAO Unimilk.
Danone will invest 120 million euros ($160 million) in Unimilk
and contribute assets to the new business as part of the
agreement.  The yogurt market is consolidating as PAI Partners is
trying to find a buyer for its 50 percent stake in Yoplait, the
world’s second-largest yogurt brand. A deal could value Yoplait
at about 1.2 billion euros, people involved in the talks said in
July.  Shareholder Support  YoCream will have 2010 sales of about $58 million, Danone
said. The Hanna family set up International Yogurt Co. in 1976,
and the company later changed its name to YoCream, according to
the company’s  website .  YoCream said shareholders owning about 77 percent of the
company’s stock plan to vote in favor of the acquisition. John
Hanna, who formed the company with his brothers Dave and Jim,
will remain chief executive officer of the company.  YoCream last traded on Nov. 22, when it rose 1.8 percent to
$28.75. Danone rose 0.5 percent, to 46.11 euros at 10:08 a.m. in
Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
