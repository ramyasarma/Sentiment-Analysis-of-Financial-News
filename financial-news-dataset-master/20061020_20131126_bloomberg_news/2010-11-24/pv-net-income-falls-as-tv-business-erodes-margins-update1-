TPV Technology Ltd. , the world’s
biggest contract maker of computer monitors, said third-quarter
profit fell 19 percent as expansion in the flat-panel television
market lowered margins.  Net income dropped to $32 million, or 1.33 cents a share,
from $39.5 million, or 1.73 cents, a year earlier, TPV
said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange today. That
compares with the $31.9 million median profit estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose to $2.95 billion from
$2.26 billion a year earlier.  TPV’s profitability came under pressure as the company
sought to attract orders for the assembly of flat-panel
televisions from clients including  Sharp Corp.  and Toshiba Corp.
Lower selling prices for TVs eroded higher earnings at TPV’s
monitor business, which benefitted from increased demand for
personal computers by businesses.  “TPV’s margins in TVs are lower than for PC monitors,”
 Steven Zhang , who rates TPV shares “hold” at DBS Vickers Ltd.
in Hong Kong, said before the earnings. Consumer demand for
flat-panel TVs has been weaker-than-expected in some markets,
such as China, Zhang said.  TPV  shares fell 1.2 percent to HK$5 in Hong Kong trading
before the announcement.  -- With assistance from  John Duce  Editors:  Suresh Seshadri ,  Tan Hwee Ann   To contact the reporter on this story:
