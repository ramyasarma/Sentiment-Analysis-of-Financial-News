Kweichow Moutai Co. , China’s biggest
liquor maker by market value, rose to the highest level in more
than two years in Shanghai trading after a brokerage said the
company may raise prices. Other liquor makers also gained.  Kweichow Moutai gained 5.8 percent to close at 199.92 yuan,
the highest since March 2008. The benchmark  Shanghai Composite
Index  gained 1.1 percent.  The baijiu liquor maker may increase prices by between 20
percent and 24 percent in late December,  Tong Xun , an analyst at
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., said today in a research note.
The brokerage set a 12-month share price estimate of 240 yuan.  Moutai’s domestic rivals  Wuliangye Yibin Co . and  Luzhou
Laojiao Co . also advanced. Wuliangye Yibin climbed 3.7 percent
to 39.27 yuan in Shenzhen and Luzhou Laojiao added 4.69 percent
to 46.02 yuan.  China’s government has taken measures to stem rising
inflation, including selling state food reserves, stabilizing
the cost of natural gas and cracking down on speculation in and
hoarding of agricultural products.  Standard Chartered Plc anticipates the country’s consumer
price index will rise an average 5.5 percent next year, with a
peak gain of 6.3 percent in June. The bank estimates this year’s
increase at 3.2 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in
2009.  -- Michael Wei . Editors:  Garry Smith ,  Chua Kong Ho   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
