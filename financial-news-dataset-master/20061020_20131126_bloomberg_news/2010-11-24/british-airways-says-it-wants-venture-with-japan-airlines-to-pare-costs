British Airways Plc , Europe’s third-
largest carrier, wants to form a venture with  Japan Airlines
Corp.  to pare costs by sharing facilities.  The accord would be similar to a joint services agreement
the carrier has with  Qantas Airways Ltd.  on U.K.-Australia
routes, Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  said in an
interview today in Tokyo.  Walsh is seeking ways to offer more services in Japan as he
said he expects a “better economic environment” for airlines
next year. British Airways, which offered to expand code-share
flights with Japan Airlines this year, has invited the Tokyo-
based carrier to move its Heathrow operations to BA’s Terminal 5.  JAL, restructuring under bankruptcy protection, earlier
this year agreed to stay in a code-sharing agreement with
 American Airlines , British Airways and other Oneworld carriers,
rejecting an offer from  Delta Air Lines Inc.  and its SkyTeam
partners to join them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
