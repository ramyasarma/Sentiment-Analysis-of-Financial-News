The dollar and yen dropped against
the Australian dollar and Brazilian real as U.S. initial jobless
claims fell to the lowest level since July 2008 and consumer
sentiment rose, spurring demand for assets related to growth.  The Canadian dollar was the best performer among major
currencies as stocks and commodities rallied and Russia said it
has added the loonie to its reserves. The euro advanced from a
two-month low against the yen as Ireland announced a plan to
lower its deficit and negotiated a financial bailout.  “Good news on the jobs front, this should be a recipe for
stronger equity markets and risk appetite, which tend to weigh
on the dollar,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist
at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “Canada and Australia, the
fact that they’re the best-performing currencies today does
point to the risk-sentiment nature of the move.”  The dollar depreciated 1 percent to 98.17 U.S. cents versus
the Australian currency at 5 p.m. in New York, from 97.23
yesterday. The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.3335, from $1.3367,
after falling to $1.3285, the lowest level since Sept. 22. The
dollar rose 0.5 percent to 83.54 yen, from 83.16 yen. The euro
gained 0.2 percent to 111.40 yen, from 111.16 yen, after
touching 110.32, the lowest since Sept. 15.  The Canadian dollar gained 1.9 percent to 82.72 yen and
appreciated 1.4 percent to C$1.0099 versus the greenback as
 Alexei Ulyukayev , first deputy chairman of Russia’s central
bank, said in an interview in Moscow that it has begun investing
in assets denominated in the loonie.  Russia Holdings  “So far the amounts are very small, but there’s perhaps
potential for increasing our holdings,” Ulyukayev said. “We
haven’t started investing in the Australian dollar yet. So far
we are just considering the possibility of including it in the
list of currencies allowed for reserve allocation.”  The pound touched a two-month high versus the euro as a
report showed the U.K.’s economy expanded 0.8 percent in the
third quarter. Sterling advanced 0.2 percent to 84.55 pence per
euro after reaching 84.29, the strongest since Sept. 21.  The euro advanced versus the yen as Ireland’s government
said it will cut spending by about a fifth and raise taxes over
the next four years.  Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  said in Dublin that the
government discussed a bailout of about 85 billion euros ($113
billion) with the International Monetary Fund and European Union
and the size hasn’t been decided yet.  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the country may
receive a “large sum” to help push down its budget deficit and
stabilize the financial system.  Lenihan’s View  “I’ve always made it clear that it’s not 100 billion”
euros, Lenihan said in an interview with  Margaret Brennan  on
Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness” program. “If it’s that
large, it’s not the case that it will all be drawn down. We have
substantial cash reserves of around 30 billion euros.”  The long-term sovereign rating of Ireland was lowered two
steps to A from AA- and its short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+
by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.  The euro fell 1.9 percent yesterday against the dollar as
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said in Berlin that the 16-
nation currency is in an “exceptionally serious” situation
after Ireland asked for a financial rescue. It was the biggest
drop in the euro since Aug. 11, when the Federal Reserve’s
outlook for slower U.S. growth spurred demand for safety.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield surged 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, to 5.12 percent, pushing the spread over
German bunds to the widest since the euro was created in 1999,
as Ireland’s bailout prompted speculation that Portugal and
Spain may also need help.  Strike in Portugal  Portugal’s first general strike in 22 years shut Lisbon’s
metro and grounded most flights as workers protested the
government’s austerity measures.  Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  of Spain said there’s
“absolutely” no risk the country will need an international
bailout as its borrowing costs compared with Germany’s surged to
a euro-era record.  The euro faces “speculative attacks” that Spain is in the
“best conditions to resist,” Salgado said in an interview on
Punto Radio in Madrid.  The yen declined 1.3 percent to 48.53 against the Brazilian
real and weakened 1.4 percent to 82 versus the Australian dollar
as evidence that the U.S. economy is recovering reduced demand
for safety. The dollar slid 0.8 percent to 1.7216 reais.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose for the first time in
three days, increasing 1.5 percent. Crude oil for January
delivery gained 3.6 percent to $84.20 a barrel.  Initial jobless claims  in the U.S. fell to 407,000 in the
week ended Nov. 20, from a revised 441,000 in the previous week,
the Labor Department reported. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of November  consumer sentiment  increased to
71.6, the highest level since June, from 67.7 a month earlier.  “The claims number was quite good, and the market has
latched on to that in a positive way,” said  Robert Lynch , head
of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
