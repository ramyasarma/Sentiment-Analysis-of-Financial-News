             ZiLog Inc., a maker of computer chips
for products including toasters and automobiles, sued
competitors  Altera Corp. (ALTR)  and Actel Corp., alleging infringement
of a patent covering a chip-programming technique.  
 In a complaint filed Dec. 1 in federal court in San
Francisco, ZiLog asked for a jury trial and unspecified cash
compensation from Altera and Actel.  
 The patent was granted in 1987 and U.S. patent regulators
are taking a second look at it, ZiLog said in the filing.  
 Stephanie Mrus, a spokeswoman for Mountain View,
California-based Actel, and Anna Del Rosario, a spokeswoman for
San Jose, California-based Altera, didn't return calls seeking
comment on the suit.  
 Perry Grace, a spokesman for San Jose-based ZiLog, also
didn't return a phone message seeking comment.  
 Shares of ZiLog, which had $78.8 million in sales last year
and a $16.8 million net loss, fell 5 cents to $4 in Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading  at 4:30 p.m.  New York  time. The  shares  have risen
64 percent this year.  
 The case is ZiLog Inc. v. Altera Corp., No. 06cv7388, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).
