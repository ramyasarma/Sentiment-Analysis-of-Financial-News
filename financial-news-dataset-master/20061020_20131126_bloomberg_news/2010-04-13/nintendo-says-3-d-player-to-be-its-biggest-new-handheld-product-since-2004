             The  Nintendo Co.  executive leading
U.S.-based sales and marketing is leaving to take a job outside
the video-game industry.  
 Executive Vice President Cammie Dunaway’s departure from
Nintendo of America is effective Oct. 1, the company said today
in an e-mailed statement. Nintendo, the maker of the DS handheld
and Wii console, did not name a replacement.  
 “Her team and the rest of Nintendo of America remain
focused on our goal of maintaining the incredible momentum
Nintendo enjoys heading into the busy holiday season,” Nintendo
of America President  Reggie Fils-Aime  said in the statement.  
 Purchases of  Microsoft Corp. ’s Xbox 360 and  Sony Corp. ’s
PlayStation have been climbing since July, and the companies are
offering new products in time for the U.S. holiday season. Sony
introduced its Move motion-activated peripherals on Sept. 19,
while Microsoft will begin selling a motion-sensing peripheral
called Kinect in November.  
 Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo, the world’s biggest maker of
video-game machines, has seen U.S. sales of its DS handheld fall
every month since the company announced plans for a new handheld
player by next March. With the Move device, Tokyo-based Sony
aims to capture some of the casual-gaming audience that has been
Nintendo’s stronghold with the Wii.
