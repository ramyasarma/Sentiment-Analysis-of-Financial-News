             Greencore Group Plc (GNC) , the world's
biggest maker of packaged sandwiches, bought  Home Made Brand
Foods Inc.  for as much as $54 million to enter the U.S. market
for chilled convenience foods.  
 The takeover will cost $44 million initially and as much as
$10 million more depending on Home Made's performance this year,
the Dublin-based company said today in a statement. The purchase
will add to per-share profit ``modestly'' starting in the fiscal
year through September 2009, according to Greencore.  
 The Irish food producer has said as long ago as January of
last year it was seeking to expand into the U.S. chilled-foods
market.  Royal Ahold NV (AH) 's Stop & Shop chain and  Delhaize Group (DELB) 's
Hannaford unit are among the customers for whom Newburyport,
Massachusetts-based Home Made turns out prepared meals, salads,
sandwiches and quiches.  
 ``This is a significant strategic acquisition for Greencore,''
Liam Igoe, an analyst at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  in Dublin who
advises buying the stock, said in a research report. ``Combined
with its U.K.-based knowledge of chilled foods, Greencore should be
able to add value to this business over the next 12 to 18 months.''  
 Spare Capacity  
 Home Made expects to generate more than $40 million in
sales in the current year and has enough spare capacity in its
factory to raise this to $100 million, the statement shows.  
 Greencore fell 7 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 3.72 euros at
10:08 a.m. in Dublin trading. The  stock  has dropped 16 percent
this year, reducing the company's market value to 750.8 million
euros ($1.2 billion).  
 Rick Walters and other Home Made managers will remain in
their current jobs, the Irish company said. Greencore appointed
Fergal Leamy, development director of its convenience-foods
unit, as head of its U.S. division and said he and other ``key''
workers will move to the country.  
 The U.S. will become ``very important'' in the next 10
years, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Coveney told RTE radio.
``We'd like to, in that kind of time frame, build a business in
 North America  comparable to the very successful business that we
have in the U.K.''
