             Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) , Turkey's
biggest media company, is planning to set up a joint venture
with  Lottomatica SpA (LTO) , the manager of Italy's national lottery,
to bid for Turkish sports-betting game Iddaa.  
 The two companies will have 50 percent each in the venture,
Dogan Yayin said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. Iddaa is currently operated by  Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) , Turkey's biggest mobile-phone company, and
 Greece 's  Intralot SA. (INLOT)   
 In February, Inteltek, the joint venture of Intralot and
Turkcell, signed a one-year interim contract to operate the
game. Turkey's state gaming authority will auction a 10-year
license to operate Iddaa by the end of the term.  
 Inteltek will bid for the license, said Constantinos Antonopoulos, Intralot's chief executive officer, in a March 14
interview.  
 Dogan Yayin shares  added 8 kurus, or 3 percent, to 2.72
liras in Istanbul trading.
