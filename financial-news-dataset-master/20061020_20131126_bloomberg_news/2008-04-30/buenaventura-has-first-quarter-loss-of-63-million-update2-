             Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA 
posted a first-quarter net loss on one-time hedging expenses.  
 The loss was $63 million, or 49 cents an American
depositary receipt, compared with profit of $36.7 million, or 29
cents, a year earlier, Lima-based Buenaventura said today in an
e-mail  statement . Revenue rose 37 percent to $226.3 million.  
 In the first two months of the year, Buenaventura paid
$516.6 million to cancel gold commitments, ending the last of
its hedges on future output. The company sold its gold at an
average $926 an ounce in the first quarter, up 51 percent from a
year earlier.  
 ``Hedging aside, it was a good operating quarter,'' Alonso Aramburu, a strategist with Santander Investment Securities in
New York, said in an interview before results were released.
``Every division of Buenaventura posted increases in output.''  
 Buenaventura's American Depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, fell $1.36, or 2.1 percent, to
$62.57 in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . They have
climbed 11 percent this year.  
 Income from minority interests, including a 44 percent
stake in Denver-based  Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha gold mine
and an 18.5 percent stake in Phoenix-based  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 's Cerro Verde copper mine, more than doubled
to $145.7 million.  
 Cerro Verde nearly tripled copper production last year
after completing an $850 million expansion. Peru is the world's
third-largest copper producer and fifth-biggest in gold.  
 Gold Output  
 Gold production rose 4 percent to 319,284 ounces on gains
at Yanacocha. Silver output rose 12 percent to 4.3 million
ounces, and zinc production jumped 23 percent to 19,362 tons.  
 Buenaventura's expenses more than tripled to $27.5 million
on a long-term compensation program. Exploration spending rose
27 percent to $11.4 million. Cash costs at Yanacocha rose 12
percent to $323 an ounce from $289 an ounce a year earlier.  
 Yanacocha will increase annual output to 2 million ounces
from an estimated 1.8 million ounces in 2008 once it brings
online its new gold mill at mid-year, said David Haughton, a
gold-mining analyst at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto  
 ``The project is expected to extend the operating life of
the mine, improve recoveries and enable treatment of more
complex ores,'' Houghton wrote in a Feb. 28 report.  
 Gold futures for June delivery rose $11.60, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $876.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
