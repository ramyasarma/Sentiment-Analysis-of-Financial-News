TiVo Inc. , the digital-video
recording pioneer, reported a wider third-quarter loss after
lowering the price of products sold to new subscribers.  The net loss of $20.6 million, or 18 cents a share, in the
period ended Oct. 31 compares with a loss of $6.45 million, or 6
cents, a year earlier, Alviso, California-based TiVo said today
in a statement. Analysts had projected a 17-cent loss, the
average of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  In the third quarter, TiVo started offering $99 DVRs on a
trial basis to new customers who signed two-year contracts at
higher monthly rates. The program, which was extended to
retailers in November, will hurt fourth-quarter results, the
company said. Prices for the players typically start at $299.  “If it pans out the way all the testing shows, it gives
you higher profitability in terms of what the value of a
subscriber is,” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Rogers  said in an
interview.  Tivo fell 3.5 percent to $8.50 in extended trading after
the results. The shares  fell  14 cents to $8.81 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading and have fallen 13
percent this year.  Revenue fell 11 percent to $50.9 million, from $57.1
million a year earlier. Analysts had expected $50.4 million,
based on average estimates.  For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates a loss of
$32 million to $34 million.  The company plans to start selling TiVo boxes to customers
of DirecTV, the leading U.S. satellite service, in early 2011,
Rogers said. TiVo had previously said the DirecTV deal would
start in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
