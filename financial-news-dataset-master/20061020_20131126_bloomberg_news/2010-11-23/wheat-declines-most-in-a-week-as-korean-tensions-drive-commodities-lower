Wheat futures fell the most in a
week as most commodities slumped amid concern that tensions
between North and South Korea will escalate.  North Korea lobbed artillery shells at a South Korean
island near the disputed border between the two countries,
killing two soldiers. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 raw materials dropped to a one-month low, and the dollar
climbed to an eight-week high against a basket of major
currencies on demand for a haven.  “Everybody is trying to figure out if is this a one-off,
or does this develop into something greater” in Korea, said
 Jason Britt , an analyst at brokerage Central States Commodities
Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri. “The dollar’s strength will lead
to defensiveness in the wheat market.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $6.79 a bushel at 10:25 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since Nov. 16.  South Korea was the fifth-biggest  importer  of U.S. wheat
last year and the third-largest  buyer  of corn, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
