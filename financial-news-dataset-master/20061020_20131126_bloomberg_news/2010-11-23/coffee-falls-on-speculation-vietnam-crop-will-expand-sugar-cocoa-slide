Robusta coffee fell for a third day
in London as investors speculated the crop in Vietnam, the
world’s largest grower of the variety, may climb after favorable
weather and expanded planting boosted the harvest.  A Bloomberg News survey of 10 growers, analysts and traders
last month predicted an increase to 1.2 million metric tons in
the year from Oct. 1. Officials in Dak Lak, Lam Dong and Gia Lai
have all forecast gains in their regions. That compares with
last year’s harvest of 1.05 million tons, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. The rainy season, which normally
finishes at the end of October, was prolonged this year and has
delayed harvesting by about two weeks.  “People are expecting a big, strong crop from Vietnam,”
said  Gary Mead , an analyst at VM Group in London. “At these
price levels farmers are making handsome profits and they’ll
ship as much coffee as they can as quickly as possible.”  Robusta coffee for January delivery lost $58, or 3.1
percent, to $1,790 a ton on NYSE Liffe at 12:35 p.m. London-
time, extending yesterday’s decline of 3.2 percent. The price of
the beans used in espressos and instant drinks has surged 38
percent this year. Arabica coffee for March delivery declined
1.5 percent to $2.04 a pound in New York.  “Everyone is expecting the rains to peter out, if not
finish entirely, soon, and that will enable harvesting and
drying of the beans to get going properly,” Mead said.  Cocoa for March delivery lost 5 pounds, or 0.3 percent, to
1,864 pounds ($2,970) a ton on NYSE Liffe, following yesterday’s
decline of 0.5 percent. The contract earlier added as much as
0.5 percent. The chocolate ingredient for March delivery slipped
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, declining 0.3 percent to $2,830
a ton. The contract earlier gained as much as 0.9 percent.  Net-Short Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-short position in New York cocoa futures in the week
ended Nov. 16, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative short positions , or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 7,886 contracts on ICE Futures
U.S., the Washington-based commission said in its Commitments of
Traders report. Net-short positions fell by 379 contracts, or 5
percent, from a week earlier.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid $2.70, or
0.4 percent, to $671 a ton in London. Prices have dropped 17
percent since they reached $811, the highest level since at
least 1989, on Nov. 11. Raw sugar for March delivery lost 1.1
percent to 26.20 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
