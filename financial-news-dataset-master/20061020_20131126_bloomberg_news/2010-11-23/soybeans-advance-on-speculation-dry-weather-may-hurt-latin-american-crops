Soybeans rose for a second day in
Chicago as dry weather threatened South American crops, stoking
concern Brazil may face a repeat of a 2005 drought that reduced
its grain and oilseed harvests.  Weather patterns indicate soybean-growing regions in
Argentina will be drier and hotter than normal, while Brazil may
turn drier in the seven days through Nov. 28, Telvent DTN Inc.
said in a forecast yesterday. The countries are the world’s
largest soybean exporters after the U.S.  “The global supply of soybeans remains very tight, so any
crop problems in Argentina and Brazil would more than likely
have a bullish effect on prices,” said  Ker Chung Yang , an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore.  Soybeans for January delivery gained as much as 2 percent
on the Chicago Board of Trade and were up 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, at $12.245 a bushel at 10:56 a.m. London time. The
oilseed advanced 1.7 percent yesterday.  Farmers growing soybeans and corn in Brazil may face a
drought similar to the one that damaged 13 percent of national
grain and oilseed crops five years ago, said Expedito Rebello,
head of research at the government’s Meteorology Institute.  Corn for March delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.2 percent, to
$5.3025 a bushel. The grain has jumped 42 percent since the end
of June on speculation U.S. production would decline.  March-delivery wheat fell 1.75 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$6.8275 a bushel. The grain has lost 4.8 percent this month on
speculation global stockpiles will outweigh declining output in
Russia and Ukraine. Milling wheat for January delivery traded on
NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.6 percent to 212.25 euros ($288.32)
a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
