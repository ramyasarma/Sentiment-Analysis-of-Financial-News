Buildings in Mumbai, India’s
financial capital, may be required to carry environmental
ratings within three years, said Valsa Nair Singh, environment
department secretary for Maharashtra state.  “We are planning environmental ratings for buildings,"
Singh said today at a conference organized by the Confederation
of Indian Industry."They will be voluntary initially.” Mumbai
is located in Maharashtra.  “We hope in three years for it to become mandatory”
throughout the state, Singh said.  Buildings may contribute more than 40 percent of global
carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, according to the
 World Green Building Council . Its Indian chapter has certified
125 buildings in the country as green, meaning they help
conserve water, energy and produce less waste, according to its
 website .  The council estimates a potential market in India for
registering 1,000 new green buildings a year that would be worth
$4 billion, according to a report on its  website . Buildings
already certified include the Pune headquarters of  Suzlon Energy
Ltd. , India’s biggest wind-turbine maker, and the Bangalore
offices of  Wipro Ltd. , the country’s third-largest software
exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
