U.S. banks posted their smallest
profit since the fourth quarter of last year after one of the
nation’s biggest lenders took a $10.4 billion writedown, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.  Bank profits totaled $14.5 billion in the three-month
period that ended Sept. 30, a decrease from $21.6 billion
reported three months earlier, the FDIC said today in its third-
 quarter report .  “Problem” banks -- those at heightened risk of failure --
rose 3.7 percent to 860 in the third quarter, the most in 17
years. Banks on the confidential list had $379.2 billion in
assets as of Sept. 30, the FDIC said.  “Credit performance has been improving, and we remain
cautiously optimistic about the outlook,” FDIC Chairman  Sheila Bair  said in a statement. “It is too early for institutions to
be reducing reserves without strong evidence of sustainable,
improving loan performance and reduce loss rates.”  Bank of America Corp. ’s card services reported a $9.87
billion loss compared with a $955 million loss a year earlier
because of a goodwill charge of $10.4 billion. The FDIC didn’t
identify the bank in question in the report.  Loan-loss reserves declined for the first time since the
fourth quarter of 2006, the FDIC said. Total reserves fell by
$9.6 billion, as large banks reduced loan-loss provisions, the
agency said.  The deficit at the agency’s deposit insurance fund narrowed
to $8 billion during the third quarter from $15.2 billion.  “The industry has come a long way in cleaning up balance
sheets, building capital, and adjusting to changes in financial
markets and the economy,” Bair said. “The adjustments are not
over, and this is no time for complacency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
