Cocoa fell for a third session in
New York as exports rose from Nigeria and Cameroon, Africa’s
third- and fourth-biggest growers. Orange juice also declined.  Cocoa shipments from Douala, the main port in Cameroon,
rose 18 percent to 7,130 metric tons in the week ended Nov. 22,
according to data e-mailed from the city today. Exports from
Nigeria rose 38 percent from the previous year, according to the
Lagos-based Federal Produce Inspection Service. The price has
lost 15 percent this year in New York.  “We are so far expecting a good crop,”  Hector Galvan , a
senior trading advisor at RJO Futures in Chicago, said today in
an e-mail.  Cocoa futures for March delivery slipped $35, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $2,804 a ton at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, after gaining as much as 0.9 percent. Last week,
the commodity rallied 3.2 percent.  In London, cocoa futures for March fell 9 pounds, or 0.5
percent, to settle at 1,860 pounds ($2,933) a ton at 4:51 p.m.
local time on NYSE Liffe.  Sic-Cacao, the cocoa-processing unit owned by Cameroon and
 Barry Callebaut AG , processed 39 percent more beans in October
than in the month before, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “The expectation is that there will be adequate supply to
meet the demand,”  Luis Rangel , a vice president at ICAP Futures
LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey, said in an interview yesterday.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-short position in New York cocoa futures in the week
ended Nov. 16, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative short positions , or bets prices
will fall, outnumbered long positions by 7,886 contracts.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery dropped 1.15
cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $1.5255 a pound in New York.
Yesterday, the price gained 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
