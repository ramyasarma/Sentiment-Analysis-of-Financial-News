Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest soft-drink maker, will double annual spending in
Indonesia to A$100 million ($97 million) by 2013 to tap rising
incomes with new products.  The company will add more drink coolers and spend more on
production and distribution capacity, Sydney-based Coca-Cola
Amatil said today in a statement. The Coke bottler also affirmed
its  forecast  for earnings before interest and tax to rise by 7
percent to 8 percent in the six months ending Dec. 31.  Chief Executive Officer  Terry Davis  predicts rising per-
capita consumption and a growing middle class will drive growth
in a market that is the company’s biggest by population, yet its
smallest by contribution to profit. While Indonesia accounts for
a quarter of the company’s sales volume, it represents 15
percent of revenue and 10 percent of earnings,  Ian Abbott , an
analyst at Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty, said in a
Nov. 18 report.  The company will add new drinks to win customers in a
market where sodas such as Sprite and Fanta have historically
outsold the Coca-Cola brand.  Coca-Cola Amatil  fell  1.3 percent to A$11.44 at the 4:10
p.m. market close in Sydney. The stock has fallen 0.8 percent
this year,  compared  with a 5.9 percent decline in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index.  Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., the world’s largest soft-drink
maker, owns 30 percent of the Australian company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
