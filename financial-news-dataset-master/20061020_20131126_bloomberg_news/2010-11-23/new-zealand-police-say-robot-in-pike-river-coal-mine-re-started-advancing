The robot sent into a New Zealand
mine to collect images and sample toxic gases following an
explosion that trapped 29 men has re-started and advanced 1,000
meters after breaking down yesterday.  A second defense force robot also entered the mine
overnight, a police spokesman said in an interview. He declined
to comment on what had been recorded by the remote cameras.  “The robots have got eyes,” Tony Kokshoorn, mayor of
Greymouth, the town about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the
coal mine, told Television New Zealand today. “They can go down
there and they’ll actually find those miners. They’ll tell us if
they are dead or alive.”  No contact has been made with the men, who range in age
from 17 to 62, since the blast on Nov. 19 at the  Pike River Coal
Ltd.  mine on the west coast of the nation’s South Island. A 65-
member rescue team is waiting for poisonous and combustible
gases to clear before beginning its search for survivors.  Kokshoorn said the families of the trapped men are seeking
some conclusion after a five-night vigil.  “We just want some conclusion here,” he said. “Unless
someone shows us otherwise we are hanging on to all hope because
there are miners down there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
