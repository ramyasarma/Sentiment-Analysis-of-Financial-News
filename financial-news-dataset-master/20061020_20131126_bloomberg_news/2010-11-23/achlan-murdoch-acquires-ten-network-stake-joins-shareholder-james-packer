Lachlan Murdoch , son of News Corp.
Chairman Rupert, has acquired a little over half of  James Packer ’s stake in  Ten Network Holdings Ltd.   Packer bought a 17.88 percent stake, or 172.2 million
shares, in the media group last month through Cavalane Holdings
Ltd. Murdoch, through Illyria Nominees Television Pty Ltd. has
agreed to buy 93.4 million shares for A$128.2 million, according
to a regulatory filing to the Australian stock exchange.  The two men will act in concert in relation to the exercise
of their votes, the statement said. Packer and Murdoch agreed to
join the board of Australia’s third-ranked television
broadcaster last month. Gina Rinehart, Australia’s richest woman,
yesterday lifted her stake in the company to 10 percent.  Packer also owns 49 percent of Consolidated Media Holdings
Ltd. which in turn has 25 percent of Foxtel, Australia’s largest
pay television operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
