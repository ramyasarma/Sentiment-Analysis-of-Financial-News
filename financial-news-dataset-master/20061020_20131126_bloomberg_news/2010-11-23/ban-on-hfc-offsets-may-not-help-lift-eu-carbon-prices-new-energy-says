A ban on some industrial-gas offsets
may not do much to boost European Union carbon prices because
supply is forecast to exceed demand coming mainly from power
utilities, analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  Assuming a ban is introduced in 2013, supply from auctions
and Certified Emission Reductions from the United Nations would
average 82 million metric tons a month in that year, compared
with average demand of 78 million tons a month, London-based
analysts including  Clemens Tummeltshammer  said yesterday by e-
mail. With no ban in place, supply would rise by 8 million tons
a month to an average of 90 million tons.  The accumulated oversupply in the EU market would reach 246
million tons by the end of 2014 assuming industrial-gas credits
are restricted, the analysis shows. The surplus will be higher
with no ban, according to New Energy Finance’s carbon model,
which considers supply and demand in the traded market including
utility buying to match forward-sales of power.  The EU is giving away about 97 percent of allowances in the
five years through 2012, according to figures from Deutsche Bank
AG. The European Commission, regulator for the 27-nation bloc,
is considering exclusion of UN-sponsored credits related to
industrial gases including hydrofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide
starting in 2013.  The EU wants to present its proposal to member states “as
soon as possible,” Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  said
Nov. 19.  Assuming there is a ban on some UN offsets, EU carbon
permits may jump to 24 euros ($33) a metric ton by 2013,
 Emmanuel Fages , an analyst for Orbeo in Paris, said in an Oct.
25 research note. Orbeo is the carbon venture of Rhodia SA and
Societe Generale SA.  Barclays Boosts Forecast  Carbon for December 2013 fell 0.4 percent today to 16.85
euros a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Prices
for 2013 may be 17 euros a ton, assuming the bloc doesn’t limit
offsets or change its 2020 emissions target, which aims for a 20
percent reduction from 1990 levels, Fages said.  Barclays Plc’s investment bank today increased its forecast
for UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for 2012 by 11
percent to 20 euros a ton from 18 euros, citing the potential
offset ban. It cut its estimate for the UN discount relative to
EU allowances that year by 20 percent to 8 euros a ton.  The potential ban “should broadly be seen as another
attempt by the European Commission to tighten up the current
liquidity in the market, with a view on higher prices,”  Trevor Sikorski , a London-based analyst at Barclays Capital, said
yesterday in an e-mailed research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
