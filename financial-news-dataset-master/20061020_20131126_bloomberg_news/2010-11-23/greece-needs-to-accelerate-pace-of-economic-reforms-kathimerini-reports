European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials will tell the Greek government to step
up the pace of deficit cuts and structural reforms as government
efforts slow,  Kathimerini reported , without citing anyone.  While deficit cuts this year have been broadly attained,
targets weren’t reached because of a revision of the 2009
deficit and sluggish tax revenue, the newspaper said. EU and IMF
officials will spell out changes which must be made by each
ministry so that a fourth payment of loans under the 110
billion-euro package is made in February, Kathimerini said.  EU, IMF and European Central Bank officials are this week
completing a review of Greek progress to qualify for a third
instalment of 9 billion euros ($12.2 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
