Ghana’s  ruling party wants to change
an oil-revenue bill being debated by lawmakers this week to
allow the West African nation to use energy-industry funds as
collateral for borrowing on international capital markets.  Moses Asaga, chairman of the parliamentary energy committee
and a member of the National Democratic Congress party of
President  John Atta Mills , said using the country’s oil wealth
would allow them to borrow funds to develop infrastructure.  “In the short term we want to move the standard of living
of Ghanaians,” Asaga told lawmakers today. A draft of the bill
released in August banned the government from borrowing against
revenue earned in the nascent energy industry. Ghana is set to
become Africa’s newest oil exporter next month when production
begins at its offshore Jubilee oil field.  Using the oil revenue as collateral will lead to over-
borrowing and high levels of debt, according to some members of
the country’s biggest opposition group, the New Patriotic Party.  “I do believe this will be the beginning of the oil curse
in our country,”  Joseph Adda , a former energy minister and NPP
member of parliament, told lawmakers today.  Ghana expects to earn 584 million cedis ($403 million) in
fiscal revenue from oil next year, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said Nov. 18. Earnings from the growing industry will
help lift economic growth to 12.3 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
