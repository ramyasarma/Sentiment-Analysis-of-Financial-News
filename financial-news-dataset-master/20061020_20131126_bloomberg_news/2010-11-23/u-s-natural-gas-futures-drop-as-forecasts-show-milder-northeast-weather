Natural gas futures fell from a
three-month high after forecasts showed milder weather in the
U.S., reducing demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped as much as 3.7 percent after the National
Weather Service revised its six-to-10-day forecast to show
normal or above-normal temperatures in the Northeast. The prior
outlook showed colder-than-normal weather across the eastern
third of the country.  “At this point, to keep gas going up, you need some real
weather demand, which is still not there,” said  Subash Chandra ,
an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York.  Natural gas for December delivery fell 10 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $4.171 per million British thermal units at 10:09
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas has declined 25
percent this year. Prices settled at $4.271 yesterday, the
highest level since Aug. 13.  The December contract expires on tomorrow. Gas for January
delivery declined 7.9 cents to $4.353.  “Gas probably tops out around $4.50 by yearend,” Chandra
said. “Yesterday it was already at almost $4.30.”  New York will have a high of 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12
Celsius) on Nov. 30, 6 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. Boston will
have a high of 53 degrees, 6 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Stockpile Report  A department report tomorrow may show that gas stockpiles
fell by 7 billion cubic feet last week, according to the median
of 7 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. It would be the
first stockpile decline of this winter heating season. The five-
year average drop for the week is 13 billion cubic feet.  The weekly inventory report is set for release a day
earlier than usually because of the Thanksgiving holiday.  Gas  inventories  gained 3 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 12 to a record 3.843 trillion cubic feet, according
to the Energy Department. A surplus to the five-year average
narrowed to 9.3 percent from 9.8 percent.  Gas’s decline also followed stocks and other commodities.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1 percent to 1,186.44. The
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials dropped
0.6 percent to 295.93.  To contact the reporters on this story:
