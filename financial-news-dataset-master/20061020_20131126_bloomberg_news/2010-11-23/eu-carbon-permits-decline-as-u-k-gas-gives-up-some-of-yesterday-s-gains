European Union carbon dioxide
permits fell as U.K. natural gas, a regional benchmark, gave up
some of yesterday’s gains.  December 2010 EU allowances declined 0.6 percent to 14.99
euros ($20.34) a metric ton at 8:42 a.m., according to data from
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. U.K. gas for the six
months through September 2011 dropped 0.5 percent, eroding
yesterday’s 3.6 percent jump, according to broker data on
Bloomberg. Certified Emission Reductions for December fell 0.6
percent to 12.40 euros a ton on ICE.  “With little to move demand, the market remains well-
supplied” with the sale of spare carbon allowances from
factories and auctions easily meeting demand from power
utilities,  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst in London for Barclays
Capital, said yesterday in an e-mailed research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
