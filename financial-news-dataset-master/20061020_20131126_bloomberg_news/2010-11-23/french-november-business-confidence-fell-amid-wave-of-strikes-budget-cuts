French business confidence declined
in November for the first time in five months after a wave of
strikes hindered economic growth and Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis raised the possibility of further budget tightening.  An  index of sentiment  among factory executives slipped to
100 from 102 in October, national statistics office Insee said
today. Economists expected a reading of 102, according to the
median of 14 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News.  Strikes and transport disruptions to protest President
 Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plan to raise the retirement age caused fuel
shortages and hampered shipping in late October. That probably
hurt confidence just as renewed market turbulence is forcing
European governments to clamp down on spending, economists said.  “The strikes will have had an impact on sentiment,” said
 Joost Beaumont , an economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. “Now the
concern will be that Ireland, Portugal and general fiscal
tightening may hurt growth in the months ahead.”  The strikes, which began Sept. 7 and came to a head at the
end of October, cost the French economy between 200 million
euros ($273 million) and 400 million euros a day at their peak
when the blockage of France’s ports and refineries caused fuel
shortages, according to Finance Ministry estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
