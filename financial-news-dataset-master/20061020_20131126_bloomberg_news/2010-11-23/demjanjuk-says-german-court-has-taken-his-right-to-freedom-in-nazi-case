John Demjanjuk , on trial for aiding
in the murder of 27,900 Jews during World War II, told a Munich
court it had robbed him of “his right to freedom.”  In his second statement to the court in the nearly year-old
case, the 90-year-old Demjanjuk said the three judges had
ignored the fact that he was a Nazi prisoner during the war.  “The court is choosing witnesses as it suits their case
against me,” Demjanjuk said in a statement translated from
Ukrainian and read to the court by an interpreter. “Today no
witness who could have helped me prove my case is alive anymore.
It’s a crime to continue this case.”  Demjanjuk, a Ukraine native and retired autoworker, lived
near Cleveland until he was stripped of his U.S. citizenship and
extradited to Israel in 1986. He was tried there on charges he
was “Ivan the Terrible,” the guard who tortured Jews while
herding them into the Treblinka concentration camp gas chambers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
