BAE Systems Plc , Europe’s biggest
defense company, said it failed to keep proper accounting
records of payments in a case that tests U.K. fraud prosecutors’
ability to negotiate plea deals.  BAE lawyer David Perry said today at a hearing at a
Magistrates Court in London that the company will enter a guilty
plea at a higher court next month. The company has entered into
a plea deal, Louis Mably, a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office,
which is prosecuting the case, told the judge.  BAE is charged with knowingly not keeping proper records
that explain payments that relate to two contracts, according to
the indictment.  District Judge  Caroline Tubbs  said sentencing should be
approved by a higher court. She sent the case to Southwark Crown
Court. The next hearing will take place on Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter for this story:
