U.S. stocks maintained losses after
minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting showed policy
makers disagreed over expanding record monetary stimulus.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 1.5 percent to
1,179.51 at 2:05 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average tumbled 160.75 points, or 1.4 percent, to 11,017.83.  Most Fed officials at the Nov. 2-3 meeting saw additional
securities purchases as keeping interest rates low and boosting
asset prices, the Fed said in minutes of the session released
today in Washington. The Fed also said it’s considering ways to
improve communication with the public, such as starting press
briefings by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.  The S&P 500 has fallen 3.8 percent since reaching a two-
year high on Nov. 5 amid concern Europe’s debt crisis is
intensifying and growing speculation that China will boost
interest rates. The decline trimmed the gauge’s rally this year
to 5.8 percent.  Stocks maintained declines earlier after the National
Association of Realtors’s report showed purchases of previously
owned homes fell 2.2 percent to a 4.43 million annual rate last
month from 4.53 million in September. Economists projected sales
would decline to a 4.48 million pace, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The median price slipped
0.9 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
