A delivery of liquefied natural gas
to the U.K. from the U.S. last week was the first such
consignment since 1959 and may mark the start of a new trade
link between the markets, JPMorgan Cazenove said.  The LNG tanker Maersk Meridian delivered an initial
shipment of the fuel to the Isle of Grain terminal, east of
London, from the Sabine Pass terminal in the U.S., National Grid
Plc said Nov. 19. The fuel had been reloaded at the U.S.
terminal, JPMorgan Cazenove analyst  Fred Lucas  said in a report
dated yesterday.  “Cargo reloading will create a physical link, albeit
presently very thin, between the U.K. and U.S. gas markets,”
which were previously “isolated,” he said. “If reloading
volumes rise materially, this could enforce a tighter price
spread between the U.K. and U.S. gas markets.”  LNG was last shipped to the U.K. from the U.S. on Feb. 20,
1959, when a tanker delivered fuel to Canvey Island from Lake
Charles, Louisiana, Lucas said. That was also the first-ever LNG
cargo, according to JPMorgan Cazenove. LNG is natural gas that’s
chilled into liquid form, shrinking in volume to 1/600th of its
gaseous state.  “We suspect that LNG exporters (especially the Qataris)
are watching this trade very closely,” Lucas said. “They will
not want to sell LNG on Henry Hub pricing only to see their gas
re-exported to higher-price markets by terminal owners,” he
said, referring to the benchmark for prices of natural-gas
futures traded in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
