Eskom Holdings Ltd., the utility
supplying 95 percent of South Africa’s power, said fiscal first-
half profit jumped almost ninefold and that funding sources have
been identified to plug a shortfall in its expansion plan.  The company, which plans to spend 440 billion rand ($62
billion) over seven years from April 1 this year, aims to secure
160 billion rand from debt capital markets, 100 billion rand
from development finance institutions and export credit
agencies, and 40 billion rand from the South African government,
Eskom said in an e-mailed statement today.  Net income jumped to 9.5 billion rand during the six months
through September, from 1.1 billion a year earlier, while sales
rose 33 percent to 51.1 billion rand, said the state-owned
company, which increased tariffs 25 percent this year.  Eskom is investing in new capacity to boost electricity
supply in Africa’s biggest economy and prevent a repeat of
outages that in early 2008 shut some of the nation’s gold and
platinum mines. The government had stopped Eskom from building
new plants for four years until 2004 while it tried and failed
to convince privately owned companies to construct power plants.  In the next decade, Eskom will add 10,000 megawatts of
generation capacity by starting production from the Medupi and
Kusile coal-fired plants and the Ingula Pumped Storage
hydropower facility.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Xstrata Plc and ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd. are among South Africa’s largest power users. The
country is the world’s biggest platinum producer and the third-
largest miner of gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
