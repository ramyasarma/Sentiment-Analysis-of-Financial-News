Cattle futures climbed to a 26-month
high as the surging cost of corn feed may lead to reduced U.S.
beef production. Hog prices were little changed.  Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, rose as much
as 3.1 percent today on signs that dry weather will hurt crops
in Brazil and Argentina, the biggest shippers after the U.S.
Livestock producers may cut back on the amount of grain in feed,
reducing animal weights and meat yields, said  Paul Beere , a
market adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc.  Farmers will “find ways to get the cattle out at a lighter
weight,” Beere said by telephone from Brookfield, Wisconsin.
“That cuts down on the total tonnage that’s produced.”  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.625 cent, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $1.05225 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After the close, the price reached
$1.0605, the highest level for a most-active contract since
Sept. 2, 2008. The commodity has gained 22 percent this year,
while corn futures jumped 31 percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement added 0.425
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.17825 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement dropped 0.025 cent to
76.9 cents a pound on the CME. The commodity jumped 4.5 percent
in the previous four sessions.  Earlier, hog prices fell as much as 1.4 percent, on
speculation that escalating tensions between North Korea and
South Korea may slow demand for U.S. meat.  North Korea lobbed artillery shells at a South Korean
island near the disputed border between the two countries in the
worst attack on its neighbor in at least eight months. South
Korea scrambled fighter jets and returned fire.  Last year, South Korea was the fifth-largest buyer of U.S.
beef and veal, and the sixth-largest consumer of U.S. pork. The
country imported 1.6 million pounds of  pork  through September,
the most-recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
