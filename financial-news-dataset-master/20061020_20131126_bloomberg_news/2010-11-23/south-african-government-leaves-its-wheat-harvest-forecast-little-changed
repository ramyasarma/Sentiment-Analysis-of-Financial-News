South Africa left its wheat crop
forecast little changed at 1.57 million metric tons from an
unchanged estimate of 558,100 hectares planted.  Farmers may reap 214,766 tons of barley, 1.7 percent lower
than previously estimated, Crop Estimates Committee official
Marda Scheepers said by phone from Pretoria today. The canola
harvest estimate was left unchanged at 39,650 tons, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
