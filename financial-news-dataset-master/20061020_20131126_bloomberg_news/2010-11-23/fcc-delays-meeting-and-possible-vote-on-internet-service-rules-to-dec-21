The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission delayed by six days, to Dec. 21, a meeting at which
it may vote on rules governing how companies led by  AT&T Inc. 
and  Comcast Corp.  provide Internet service.  The agency announced the change today in an e-mailed news
release.  Nineteen Republican lawmakers told FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  in a Nov. 19 letter that it would be “a mistake”
to vote soon on net-neutrality rules, which would prevent
Internet-service providers from selectively blocking or slowing
content delivered to subscribers while favoring their offerings
and those of business partners. Rule-making should be left to
Congress, the members said.  The FCC, which proposed rules last year, may vote on the
regulations next month,  Paul Gallant , a Washington-based analyst
with MF Global, said in a Nov. 19 note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
