(Corrects to biggest drop in 9 months in first paragraph.)  Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ,
the biggest maker of switches for data-storage networks, fell
the most in nine months on the Nasdaq after its fiscal first-
quarter sales and profit  forecasts  missed analysts’ estimates.  Earnings, excluding some costs, will be 9 cents to 10 cents
a share on sales of no more than $550 million, the San Jose,
California-based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
That compares with profit of 14 cents and sales of $556.9
million, the average of  projections  compiled by Bloomberg.  The report follows a forecast from Cisco Systems Inc.,
which leads the overall networking industry, that fell short of
analysts’ predictions and sent its shares tumbling.  Brocade 
competes with Cisco and Juniper Networks Inc. in the market for
gear that directs data over computer networks. It was named in
April as an acquisition target by Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc.  Brocade  slid 57 cents, or 10 percent, to $5.13 at 4 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the largest decline
since Feb. 23. The shares have lost 33 percent  this year .  Net income  in the fourth quarter fell 27 percent to $23.4
million, or 5 cents a share, from $32.1 million, or 7 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue grew 5.5 percent to $550.4 million, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
