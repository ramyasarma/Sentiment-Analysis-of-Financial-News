The euro fell for a second day
against the dollar on speculation an election in Ireland
will hinder the nation’s aid talks with the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund.  The 16-nation currency dropped to $1.3592 from $1.3627
yesterday in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
