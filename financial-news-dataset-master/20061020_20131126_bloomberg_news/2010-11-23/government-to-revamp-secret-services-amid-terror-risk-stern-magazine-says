Germany plans to cuts the number of
secret-service agencies to two from three, reducing overlap in
areas of work to boost its effectiveness in tackling terrorism,
 Stern  magazine reported.  Germany’s MAD military intelligence unit will be scrapped,
the weekly magazine reported today on its Web site, citing
federal lawmaker Christian Ahrendt. MAD’s 1,300 staff will join
the BND secret service, which focuses on foreign intelligence
gathering, and the Office for the Protection of the
Constitution, whose focus is more domestic, Stern said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
