The Kenyan shilling weakened for the
first time in seven trading days after the central bank bought
euros, forcing domestic lenders to cover their short euro
positions.  The currency weakened as much as 0.7 percent to 80.60 per
dollar and was trading at 80.20 shillings as of 12:35 p.m. in
Nairobi, the capital. The East African nation’s currency closed
trading yesterday at 80.05 shillings.  Kenya’s central bank bought 5 million euros ($6.78 million)
in the foreign-exchange market yesterday to build reserves and
support the government’s external payments, said an official at
the  Central Bank of Kenya  who can’t be identified in line with
central bank policy.  “The central bank’s purchase of euros pushed banks to cover
their euro shorts by buying dollars, hence the weakening of the
shilling,” John Muli, a trader at African Banking Corp., said in
a phone interview. A short position is a bet against an asset.  Last month, Governor  Njuguna Ndung’u  said the central bank
had increased purchases of foreign currency to boost reserves.
 Kenya ’s gross foreign-exchange reserves increased to $3.9
billion in August, equivalent to about four months of import
cover, from $3.6 billion a year earlier, according to the bank’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
