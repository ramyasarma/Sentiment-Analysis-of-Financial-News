U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump
fell 0.9 percent last week from the previous week,  MasterCard
Inc.  said in its SpendingPulse report. The decline was the
fourth in five weeks.  Motorists bought an average 9.12 million barrels of the
fuel a day in the week ended Nov. 19, the second-biggest
payments network company said today. Last week’s demand rose 0.5
percent from a year earlier, the first year-over-year increase
in six weeks.  Averaged over four weeks, fuel use was 1 percent below a
year earlier, the ninth consecutive drop in that measure. It was
the smallest decline in that average since Sept. 24.  “We’ve had improvement in the year-over-year growth rate,
and the four-week average is starting to improve,”  John Gamel ,
director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in a
telephone interview.  Demand typically rises over the Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays. The four-day Thanksgiving weekend begins Nov. 25.  “We’ll probably have decent weather in most of the major
cities, and there’s no expectation of a spike in gas prices,”
Gamel said.  The  average pump price  for regular gasoline rose 2 cents to
$2.88 a gallon, the highest level since May 14 and 9.9 percent
higher than a year earlier. Prices peaked at $2.91 on May 7.  “We do have higher prices,” Gamel said. “Last year
prices fell, and this year prices have increased going into
Thanksgiving.”  Through Nov. 19, drivers had purchased 0.4 percent more
gasoline in 2010 than during the same period in 2009, the same
as the prior week.  The highest demand this year was 9.71 million barrels a day
in the week ended May 28, boosted by motorists filling their
tanks before the May 31 Memorial Day holiday. The lowest was
8.84 million in the week ended Sept. 10.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc.  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
