Mobile advertising revenue will
rise tenfold to about $24.1 billion by 2015, with much of that
growth coming from China and India, according to Informa
Telecoms & Media.  Informa “believes that the global mobile-advertising
market was worth $2.3 billion in 2009,” Shailendra Pandey, a
senior analyst with London-based consultant  Informa , said in an
report today. The Asia Pacific Developing region will account
for the largest share by 2015, at 30.9 percent, driven by
“strong growth” from China and India, Pandey said. The Asia
Pacific Developed region, including Japan and South Korea, will
fall to 21.7 percent from about 43.6 percent this year.  Google Inc.  and  Apple Inc.  have both bought mobile
advertising businesses in the past year to take advantage of
consumers’ increasing use of mobile devices to buy goods and
services. Google bought Admob in May for $750 million and Apple
paid more than $200 million for Quattro Wireless in January.  “Successful companies that have unique and attractive
technology for mobile advertising,” will become takeover
targets for companies such as Google, Apple,  Nokia Oyj  and
Yahoo! Inc, Pandey said. Apple’s iAd network, which was started
in July, “will force its rivals to speed up their own mobile
advertising strategies, particularly Google, which has
completed its acquisition of AdMob,” he said.  North America will account for 18 percent of the market in
2015, with Latin America at 6.4 percent and Western Europe 8.6
percent, according to the report.  “The mobile advertising industry has now moved beyond the
trial and experimental phase and many advertisers and brands
are now spending significant sums on running mobile campaigns
each month,” Pandey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
