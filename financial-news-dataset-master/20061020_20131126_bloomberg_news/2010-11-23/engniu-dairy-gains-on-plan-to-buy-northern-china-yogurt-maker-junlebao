China Mengniu Dairy Co. , the
nation’s biggest maker of liquid milk, rose in Hong Kong
trading after saying it will acquire control of a yogurt maker.  Mengniu  gained as much as 4.4 percent to HK$22.50, the
biggest intraday gain since Sept. 1, before closing at HK$21.70
on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
fell 2.7 percent, extending declines after North and South
Korea exchanged fire.  The dairy maker will pay 469 million yuan ($71 million)
for a 51 percent stake in Junlebao Dairy Co., located in the
northern province of Hebei, said Mengniu in an e-mailed
statement. The acquisition will boost Hohhot, Inner Mongolia-
based Mengniu’s share of China’s yogurt market to more than 30
percent, it said, without disclosing how much it has now.  Junlebao , founded in 1995, has China’s biggest yogurt
production plant, according to its website. It’s one of China’s
ten biggest makers of liquid milk, the company said, citing
research by Nielsen Co.  Junlebao is the largest yogurt maker in northern China and
had sales of 1.26 billion yuan in 2009, Mengniu said in its
statement.  Mengniu has dropped 22 percent this year, compared with a
4.7 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng.  -- Michael Wei . Editor:  Frank Longid   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
