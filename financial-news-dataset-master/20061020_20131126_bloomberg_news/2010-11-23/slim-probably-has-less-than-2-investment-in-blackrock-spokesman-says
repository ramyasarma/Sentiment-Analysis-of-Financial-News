Carlos Slim , the world’s richest man
according to Forbes magazine, has acquired shares of BlackRock
Inc., the world’s biggest money manager, expanding his U.S.
holdings.  Arturo Elias , Slim’s spokesman, said yesterday in a
telephone interview that he thinks Slim’s holding is less than
the 2 percent figure reported Nov. 21 by the Financial Times,
which cited unidentified people familiar with the investment.
Elias said he didn’t know the exact amount of the stake or
whether Slim holds it directly or through a fund.  The investment adds to a portfolio of U.S. holdings that
includes luxury retailer Saks Inc. and publisher New York Times
Co., which like  BlackRock  are based in New York. Funds operated
by BlackRock hold shares in Slim’s America Movil SAB, Latin
America’s largest wireless carrier.  Slim, 70, has about $64 billion in public holdings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mexico City-based
America Movil counts for about two-thirds of that wealth. He
also controls Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, Mexico’s fifth-
largest bank by outstanding loans.  BlackRock is looking to expand its business in
international markets including Latin America, the Financial
Times said in its story. BlackRock said last week that it plans
to offer local exchange-traded funds in Colombia and Chile to
reach investors in South America.  Bank of America Corp. and PNC Financial Services Group
Inc., two of BlackRock’s biggest investors, said earlier this
month that they plan to sell 42 million shares of the firm.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-biggest bank, agreed
to buy a 2 percent stake in BlackRock for $500 million,
including shares sold by Bank of America, two people briefed on
the transaction said Nov. 12.  Bobbie Collins , a spokeswoman for BlackRock, said she had
no further comment on Slim’s stake beyond Elias’s statement.  BlackRock fell $3.84, or 2.3 percent, to $163.03 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
