Royal Dutch Shell Plc ’s
terminal on India’s west coast may receive at least one
liquefied natural gas cargo this month, according to ship
transmission data.  Catalunya Spirit, a 135,423 cubic-meter tanker owned by
Teekay Corp., is scheduled to reach Shell’s Hazira LNG terminal
on Nov. 27, possibly carrying a cargo from Trinidad & Tobago,
according to ship transmissions captured by AISLive on
Bloomberg. The terminal received at least one spot cargo last
month from Qatar.  Shell opened its Hazira terminal to Gujarat State Petroleum
Corp., allowing a third party to use it for the first time, it
said in July. The terminal received at least one cargo in each
of the past three months, according to ship data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
