Gecina SA , France’s second-largest
publicly traded property company, bought three office buildings
near Paris for 440 million euros ($596 million) as it seeks to
almost double office holdings by 2014.  Two assets will have an average yield of 6.5 percent, with
one “speculative” development securing a return of 8 percent,
Gecina, based in the French capital, said today in a  statement .  French commercial-property values rose in the six months
through June, snapping a two-year decline brought on by the
financial crisis. Gecina plans to expand its office assets to 9
billion euros by 2014 from 5.5 billion euros currently, the
company said on Nov 5.  “Gecina targets large prime assets with a strong
architectural identity and a revenue profile that appears to be
relatively low-risk,” the company said in the statement.
“These buildings are ideally designed to accommodate
headquarters, with single tenants in priority.”  Gecina has sold 14 office buildings in 2010 for 180 million
euros, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
