Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Vice
Chairman  Charles Munger , the 86-year-old business partner of
 Warren Buffett , disposed of almost $750 million of the company’s
stock following his wife’s death earlier this year.  Munger distributed 6,008 Class A shares and 750 Class B
shares on Nov. 4 through about 30 transactions. Each disposal
was made “to a beneficiary of a community property revocable
trust” of which he and his wife were co-trustees, the executive
said today in a regulatory filing. The disposed stock had a
value of $747.9 million based on the Nov. 4 closing prices of
$124,480 for Class A shares and $82.96 for Class B shares.  Munger helped Buffett build Berkshire into a $200 billion
provider of insurance, energy and consumer goods. The two men
appear on stage together each year before tens of thousands of
Berkshire shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in Omaha,
Nebraska. Munger’s Class A holdings dropped to 6,528 shares
after the disposals.  Munger’s wife,  Nancy Barry Munger , a Los Angeles
philanthropist, died on Feb. 6. Munger didn’t immediately reply
to an interview request left with an assistant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
