Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. ,
China’s fourth biggest automaker, rose the most in two weeks in
Shenzhen trading after saying it will build a new plant in
Beijing to produce passenger cars.  The  stock  jumped as much as 6.8 percent and traded at 11.19
yuan at 10:46 a.m. local time, headed for the biggest gain since
Nov. 8. The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  fell 2.6 percent
to 2,809.97.  The Chinese automaker plans to invest 4.3 billion yuan
($647 million) to build a factory that will produce 200,000
vehicles a year, according to a stock exchange filing. Chairman
 Xu Liuping  said last month the company plans to make 6 million
cars in 2020, double its production target of 3 million in 2012.  Changan will make cars, sport utility vehicles as well as
automobiles powered by alternative energy at its new factory in
Beijing, according to the statement. The plant will start
production in June 2012, the company said.  -- Tian Ying . Editors:  Chua Kong Ho ,  Suresh Seshadri .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
