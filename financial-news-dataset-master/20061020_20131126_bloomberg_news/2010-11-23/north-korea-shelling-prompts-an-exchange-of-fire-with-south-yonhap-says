North Korea fired tens of artillery
shells near the western border with South Korea, prompting the
South’s military to fire back, Yonhap News reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Most of the shells fell into the water, with some landing
on an island, Yonhap said. It wasn’t clear if there were any
casualties, according to the report.  Calls to the Ministry of National Defense in Seoul weren’t
answered.  The report comes amid heightened tensions on the peninsula
after North Korea revealed a new nuclear plant for enriching
uranium, which could be used to make atomic weapons. North Korea
is under United Nations sanctions because of nuclear tests as
the regime resists efforts to scrap its weapons program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
