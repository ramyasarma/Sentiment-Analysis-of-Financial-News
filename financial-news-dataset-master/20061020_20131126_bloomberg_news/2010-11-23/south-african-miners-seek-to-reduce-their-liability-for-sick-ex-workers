A South African court will today
consider whether mining companies should cover a 610-million
rand ($87 million) shortfall in a fund which compensates miners
suffering from lung diseases due to their work.  South Africa’s Chamber of Mines, which represents most
mining companies operating in the country, said it would be
“unlawful” for some companies to be made to pay for past
employees, according to a statement e-mailed yesterday. The
chamber said it filed an application to protect its members to
Pretoria’s North Gauteng High Court.  The shortfall for the fund, which springs out of a
compensation law from 1973, stems from its sporadic functioning,
a lack of contributors and poor accounting, according to the
mining body.  Many former South African mineworkers suffer from diseases
such as silicosis because of their exposure to dust in the
world’s deepest gold mines. Companies that operate gold mines in
the country include  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd .,  Harmony Gold Mining
Co . and  Gold Fields Ltd .  The National Union of Mineworkers, the country’s largest
labor union, opposed the application.  “This latest application represents an outrageous and
cynical attempt by the Chamber of Mines to avoid the liability
of its members to contribute to the compensation of former
mineworkers,” NUM said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
