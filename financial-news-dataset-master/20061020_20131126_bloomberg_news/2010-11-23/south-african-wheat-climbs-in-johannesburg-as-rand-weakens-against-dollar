Wheat prices advanced in South
Africa as the rand weakened against the dollar, making imports
more expensive for local millers.  The rand traded at 7.0445 to the dollar at 9:21 a.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 6.9761 at the close of grain trading
at noon yesterday.  Wheat for December delivery, the most active contract,
increased 12 rand, or 0.5 percent, to 2,677 rand ($380) a metric
ton on the South African Futures Exchange.  White corn for December delivery fell 6 rand, or 0.5
percent, to 1,275 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is the
country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for December delivery declined 10 rand, or 0.8
percent, to 1,329 rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as animal
feed in South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today are as follows. All prices are in rand,
and the crops are sold in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
