Iran’s parliament planned to impeach
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and was blocked from doing so by
the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing domestic newspaper reports.  Members of parliament are also seeking debate on the
impeachment, the newspaper said.  Ahmadinejad is accused by those favoring his removal of 14
violations of Iranian law, including the illegal import of
gasoline and oil, the Journal reported.   Lawmakers have began a drive to collect the 74 member
signatures needed to open a formal debate on the president, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
