Cocoa exports from  Nigeria , the
fourth-biggest producer of the commodity, rose 38 percent in the
2009/2010 growing season from a year earlier, the Lagos-based
Federal Produce Inspection Service said.  Shipments rose to 218,654.5 metric tons, according to
figures obtained from the service, which inspects cocoa beans
before they are exported from Nigeria’s ports.  Shipments for the first nine months of 2010 rose an annual
22 percent to 127,602.5 metric tons, the service said. September
exports rose 77 percent to 14,070 metric tons, Adekunle
Adebambo, a spokesman for the service, said by phone late
yesterday.  Nigeria’s cocoa year typically begins in October with the
main-crop season, which ends in January of the following year
and is followed by a light-crop season beginning in April. The
dates can vary according to weather conditions.  Nigeria ranks behind  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and Indonesia in
cocoa production, according to the International Cocoa
Organization. Cocoa exports are Nigeria’s biggest foreign
exchange earner after crude oil, according to figures published
by the Nigerian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
