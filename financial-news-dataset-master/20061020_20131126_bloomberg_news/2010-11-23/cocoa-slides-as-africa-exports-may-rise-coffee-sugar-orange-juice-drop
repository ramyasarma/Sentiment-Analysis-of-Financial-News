Cocoa fell for a third session in
New York as exports rose from Nigeria and Cameroon, Africa’s
third- and fourth-biggest growers. Coffee, sugar and orange
juice also declined.  Cocoa shipments from the main port in Cameroon rose 18
percent to 7,130 metric tons in the week ended Nov. 22,
according to data e-mailed from Douala today. Exports rose in
Nigeria, topping last year’s harvest by 38 percent, according to
the Lagos-based Federal Produce Inspection Service. Before
today, the price lost 14 percent this year in New York.  “The expectation is that there will be adequate supply to
meet the demand,”  Luis Rangel , a vice president at ICAP Futures
LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey, said in an interview yesterday.
“The crop so far this year looks like a good one.”  Cocoa futures for March delivery slipped $1 to $2,838 a ton
