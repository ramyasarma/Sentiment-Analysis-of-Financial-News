Jann Wenner, who controls magazine
publisher Wenner Media Inc., has chosen Jason Fine, Rolling
Stone’s executive editor, to head Men’s Journal as well, the New
York Post reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Fine’s appointment as the replacement for Brad Weiners, who
was fired last week, will be made public this week, the
newspaper said.  There’s speculation that the staffs of Rolling Stone and
Men’s Journal might be brought closer together, to cut costs,
the Post said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
