Spain sold 3.25 billion euros ($4.40
billion) of treasury bills, less than the maximum target set for
the auction, amid escalating concern that the fallout from the
Irish sovereign debt crisis is spreading to other nations.  The Treasury sold 2.09 billion euros of three-month bills
today at an average yield of 1.743 percent, Bank of Spain data
showed today. That compares with a yield of 0.951 percent at the
last sale on Oct. 26. It also auctioned 1.16 billion euros of
six-month bills at 2.111 percent, compared with 1.285 percent
last month.  Spain is facing higher borrowing costs amid speculation
more countries will struggle to manage their deficits after
Ireland’s bailout failed to check a selloff in the nation’s
bonds. The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
 bonds  instead of similar-maturity benchmark German bunds climbed
to 231 basis points, near a euro-era record.  “The possible domino effect of the Irish bailout is what’s
moving the market,” said  Juan Jose Figares , chief analyst at
Link Securities in Madrid. “Spain is clearly not Portugal nor
Ireland, but markets are not looking at fundamentals now.”  The indicative range set for today’s offering was 3 billion
euros to 4 billion euros.  Investors bid for 2.34 times the three-month bills on
offer, down from 2.77 times at the last auction. The bid-to-
cover ratio for the six-month auction was 2.65 times, up from
2.08 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
