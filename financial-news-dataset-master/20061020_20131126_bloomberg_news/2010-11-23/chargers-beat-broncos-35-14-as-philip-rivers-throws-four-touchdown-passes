Philip Rivers  threw four touchdown
passes as the San Diego Chargers beat the Denver Broncos 35-14
for their third straight win.  The Chargers scored 35 consecutive points last night after
falling behind 7-0 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.  Malcolm Floyd ,  Patrick Crayton ,  Darren Sproles  and  Jacob Hester  all caught touchdown passes from Rivers, who pushed his
season total to 23, the most in the National Football League
through 11 weeks of the season.  The Chargers improved their record to 5-5 and remain one
game behind the first-place Kansas City Chiefs in the American
Football Conference’s West Division.  With San Diego’s “Monday Night Football” victory, 20 of
the NFL’s 32 teams have records of .500 or better with six weeks
left in the regular season. No division leader has more than a
one-game lead and four of the league’s eight divisions have two
teams tied for first place.  The Broncos are in last place in the AFC West with a 3-7
record and have lost five of their past six games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
