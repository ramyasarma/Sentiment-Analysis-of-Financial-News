The  International Monetary Fund  said
it reached an agreement in principle to provide  Kenya  with a
$500 million extended credit facility to help boost growth in
East Africa’s biggest economy.  The loan, which is subject to approval by the IMF’s
management and executive board, will fund an economic program
that runs through December 2013, Domenico Fanizza, the mission
chief for Kenya, said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The main goal of the authorities’ economic program is to
transform Kenya into a dynamic economy by raising growth
sustainably,” he said.  Kenya’s economic expansion slowed in the past two years
following a drought that curbed farming output and after post-
election violence in 2008 cut investment and tourism. The IMF
loan will fund investment in energy infrastructure including
geothermal power plants and the implementation of a new
constitution approved in August, Fanizza said.  The country will gradually reduce its budget deficit and
work with the World Bank to create a better investment climate
and strengthen governance, he said. Kenya is targeting a fiscal
gap of 6.8 percent this year and less than 6 percent in 2011-12,
Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said on Oct. 25.  “Monetary policy will focus on containing inflation within
the 5 percent target, maintaining a floating exchange rate
regime, and the gradual accumulation of international reserves,”
Fanizza said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
