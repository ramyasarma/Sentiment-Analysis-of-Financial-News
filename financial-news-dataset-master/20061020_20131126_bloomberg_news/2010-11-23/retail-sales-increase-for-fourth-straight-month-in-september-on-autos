Canadian  retail sales  increased in
September, the fourth straight gain, led by automobiles and
general merchandise stores.  Sales advanced 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted C$36.4
billion ($35.8 billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a 0.7 percent
increase, according to the median of 22 estimates.  Sales increased 3.3 percent in the 12 months ending in
September as the  unemployment rate  declined to 8 percent from
8.3 percent. Consumption will slow next year as households are
constrained by high debt loads, the Bank of Canada said last
month.  Eight of 11 sales categories advanced during the month, the
agency said in its report, including a 1.2 percent increase for
automobile and parts dealers to C$8.07 billion. Excluding that
category,  sales  rose 0.4 percent, compared with economist
predictions for a 0.3 percent gain. Sales in volume terms rose
0.4 percent on the month.  Receipts at general merchandise store rose 2 percent and
increased 2.3 percent at sporting goods, hobby, book and music
shops. Building material and garden equipment store sales fell
1.6 percent, the report said. This category has been slowing
after the government ended temporary home renovation tax credits
earlier this year.  Statistics Canada also revised its estimate of the August
increase in total retail sales to 0.7 percent from an earlier
reading of 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
