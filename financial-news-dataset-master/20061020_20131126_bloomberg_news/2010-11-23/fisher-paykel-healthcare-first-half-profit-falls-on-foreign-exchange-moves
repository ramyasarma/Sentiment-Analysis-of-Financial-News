Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp. , a
New Zealand maker of breathing masks and hospital equipment,
reported a 54 percent decline in first-half profit after the
strong local currency moved against the company.  Net income fell to NZ$16.9 million ($12.8 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30, from NZ$37 million a year earlier,
according to a statement today. Full-year profit will be NZ$60
million to NZ$63 million, lower than forecast in August, the
company said.  Fisher & Paykel Healthcare sells its products in more than
120 countries, and received 56 percent of its revenues in U.S.
dollars, according to the statement. During the six month
period, the New Zealand currency bought between 66 U.S. cents
and 74 U.S. cents, the company said. It bought 75.8 cents today
after almost reaching 80 cents earlier this month.  “The reduction in the half-year result primarily reflects
unfavorable exchange rate movements,” the company said in the
statement.  While demand increased for the company’s respiratory and
acute care products, operating revenue fell 3 percent to NZ$245
million, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
