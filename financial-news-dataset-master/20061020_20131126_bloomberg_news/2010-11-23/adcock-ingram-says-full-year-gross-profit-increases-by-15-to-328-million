Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. , South
Africa’s second-largest pharmaceutical company, reported a 19
percent drop in annual profit after the company accounted for
the sale of shares to black investors to comply with ownership
laws.  Net income fell to 631.5 million rand ($90 million) in the
twelve months through September, from 782.4 million a year
earlier, Johannesburg-based Adcock said in a statement today.
Sales rose 11 percent to 4.4 billion rand.  Adcock said normalized earnings, which exclude once-off
expenses such as the 269 million rand related to its empowerment
transaction, rose 16 percent to 900 million rand. South African
companies are required to have black shareholders to meet laws
aimed at transforming ownership to make up for apartheid which
ended in 1994.  New “launches and line extensions” are planned for 2011,
Chief Executive Officer  Jonathan Louw  said in a separate
statement today. “Acquisition opportunities in the personal
care and well-being categories have been identified.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
