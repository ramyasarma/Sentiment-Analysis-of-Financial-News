Exxon Mobil Corp. will build a
diesel hydrotreater at its Singapore refining complex and
increase its output of ultra-low-sulfur supplies by the
equivalent of 2 percent of China’s demand for the transport fuel.  The world’s  largest listed  oil and gas company plans to
boost supplies by 9 million liters a day to more than 25 million,
Exxon said in an e-mailed statement today. The additional daily
output is equivalent to 56,600 barrels. China may consume 2.87
million barrels a day of diesel this year, based on forecasts by
the International Energy Agency.  The facility may be completed by 2014, Karen Wong, the
company’s media relations and communications advisor in
Singapore, said by telephone. She declined to specify the cost
of the construction.  Exxon is spending more than $1 billion on diesel
hydrotreaters at refineries in Baytown in Texas, Baton Rouge in
Louisiana and in Belgium’s Antwerp to boost the plants’ capacity
by 22 million liters a day. That’s about 140,000 barrels a day.  Diesel, or gasoil, has outpaced gains in crude as the
global economic recovery bolsters fuel demand. In Singapore,
 gasoil’s premium  to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark, climbed to
$14.32 a barrel last week, the highest since January 2009,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage.  Exxon’s Singapore refining complex, the company’s biggest
globally, comprises a 296,000 barrel-a-day plant on Jurong
Island off the country’s southwestern coast and a 309,000
barrel-a-day refinery on the mainland, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
