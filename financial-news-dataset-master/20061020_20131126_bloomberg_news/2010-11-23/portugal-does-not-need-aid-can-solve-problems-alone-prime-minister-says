Portugal does not need aid and can
solve its problems, Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said
following Ireland’s plan to seek a rescue.  “We do not need help from anyone to solve our problems,”
Socrates said last night in an interview on television channel
SIC Noticias. “We will solve our own problems.”  “Buying Portuguese sovereign debt is a good investment,”
Socrates said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
