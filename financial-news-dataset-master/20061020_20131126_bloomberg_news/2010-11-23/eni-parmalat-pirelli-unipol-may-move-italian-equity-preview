Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
dropped for a fourth day, losing 0.1 percent to 19,941.19 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following companies moved in Italian trading. Stock
symbols are in parentheses.       Ansaldo STS SpA  (STS IM) jumped 6.5 percent to 9.70 euros,
the steepest increase since May and the biggest gain in the FTSE
MIB. Finmeccanica SpA’s railway-technology unit was among
Italian companies that won orders for the 21.3 billion-krone
($3.83 billion) expansion of Copenhagen’s underground train
system.       Enel SpA  (ENEL IM), Italy’s biggest utility, which owns
Spain’s Endesa, dropped 1 percent to 3.78 euros. Spain has
frozen its 13.5 billion-euro ($18 billion) program to sell
state-guaranteed bonds to bridge the so-called tariff deficit
until government debt market volatility abates, people with
direct knowledge of the transaction said.       Fondiaria-Sai SpA  (FSA IM), which announced a share sale on
Nov. 22, dropped 3.4 percent to 5.9 euros. The insurer had its
BBB rating placed on watch negative by Fitch Ratings on concern
about its planned capital increase and profitability.       Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM) rose 1.7 percent to 12.24 euros,
rebounding from two days of declines. The world’s second-biggest
cable maker ruled out increasing its 840 million-euro bid for
Draka Holding NV yesterday after a competing offer from China’s
Tianjin Xinmao S&T Investment Corp.  “The strong de-rating of Prysmian is in our view
unwarranted,” CA Cheuvreux analysts wrote in a report,
reiterating an “outperform” recommendation on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
