Wintry weather gripping the U.K. has
shut the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, with snow also
affecting operations at Aberdeen airport,  BAA Airports  Ltd.
said.  Icy roads and heavy snow are expected to continue in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, the U.K.’s Met Office said in a
weather warning, with snow also forecast to affect many areas of
England including London and the south east, which may see as
much as 8 centimeters of snow.  The  Met Office  issues weather warnings when there is at
least 80 percent confidence that severe or extreme weather is
expected, the agency said on its website.  Temperatures in London are predicted to dip to minus 1
degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) today, and reach a low of
minus 4 degrees by Dec. 1, according to Global Weather Platform.  Glasgow Airport is currently open following a closure
earlier today, BAA said on its website. Six flights have been
canceled and others are subject to delays, the airport operator
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
