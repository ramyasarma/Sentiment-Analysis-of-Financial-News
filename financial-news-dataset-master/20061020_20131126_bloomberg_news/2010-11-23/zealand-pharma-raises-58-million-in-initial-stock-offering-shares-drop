Zealand Pharma A/S , the Danish
drugmaker developing a diabetes medicine with Sanofi-Aventis SA,
 raised a net 321 million kroner  ($58 million) in its initial
public stock offering, a third of what it originally targeted.  Zealand Pharma  issued 4.34 million shares priced at 86
kroner a piece, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said
today. The price was the bottom of the range that the Glostrup,
Denmark-based drugmaker had proposed for the Copenhagen listing.
Shares fell as much as 5.8 percent when trading started .  Zealand Pharma last week pared listing plans, cutting the
price and number of shares to be offered, after investors said
they weren’t interested in investing in its experimental heart
disease drug. The drugmaker originally planned to issue as many
as 9 million shares, priced as high as 120 kroner and raising as
much as 1.1 billion kroner, including over-allotments.  “We listened to investors and what they thought was
important,” Solomon said by phone.  The newly listed shares constitute 19.7 percent of the
total share capital, Zealand Pharma said in a statement. At 86
kroner, the sale valued the company at 1.89 billion kroner.  Danske Bank A/S and Jefferies International Ltd., which
jointly coordinated the listing, may exercise an over-allotment
option for another 650,407 shares, the statement said. They have
a Dec. 23 deadline.  If they do so in full, gross proceeds from the IPO will
rise to 429 million kroner from 373 million kroner, the company
said. The owners, including Sunstone Capital and LD Pension,
would continue to hold 77.4 percent.  Zealand Pharma  fell as much  as 5 kroner to 81 kroner and
traded at that price at 10:35 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
