One of the largest bank lobbying
groups in Washington has named the Republican former governor of
Oklahoma to lead its campaign to shape the implementation of the
Dodd-Frank Act.  Frank Keating , 66, has been named the next chief executive
officer of the  American Bankers Association . Keating, who served
in a similar capacity for the American  Council of Life Insurers ,
will take the reins of the Washington-based trade group on Jan.
1 when  Edward Yingling , the current president and CEO, retires.  “Coming out of the financial crisis, we are entering a
period of great change for our industry,”  Stephen P. Wilson ,
the ABA’s chairman, said today in a statement. “We wanted a
strong, proven leader and consensus builder who will listen to
the concerns of bankers and be a dynamic champion for our
industry during this critical time.”  Wilson, in the statement, said Keating was the “unanimous
choice” of the search committee.  The ABA, one of the most prominent industry lobbying groups
in Washington, represents banks of all sizes. It is in the midst
of a  campaign  to shape the implementation of the Dodd-Frank
financial-regulation law enacted this year. The industry group
opposed much of the final law, specifically the newly created
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The new law “contains a tsunami of new rules and
restrictions for traditional banks that had nothing to do with
causing the financial crisis in the first place,” Yingling said
in a  statement  the day the President  Barack Obama  signed the
bill into law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
