Bulgari SpA , the world’s third-
largest jeweler, said  Hengdeli Holdings Ltd.  will distribute its
timepieces in China under a five-year partnership.  Hengdeli, which is listed in Hong Kong, will be the sole
distributor of Bulgari watches in more than 50 multi-brand
stores that will open in the next five years in mainland China,
Rome-based Bulgari said today in an e-mailed statement.  “It makes a lot of sense,”  Alessandro Migliorini , an
analyst at Helvea SA in Geneva, said by telephone. Hengdeli can
help Bulgari, which has lagged behind some rivals in China,
“penetrate the different parts of the country in the best
possible ways.” He has a “neutral” rating on Bulgari stock.  Bulgari rose as much as 4.4 percent in Milan trading and
was up 2.1 percent at 7.49 euros as of 1:40 p.m. The stock has
gained 30 percent this year, giving the 126-year-old company a
market value of 2.26 billion euros ($3.1 billion).  Bulgari has 20 stores in China out of 286 worldwide.  Swatch
Group AG ’s Omega timepieces can be found in about 80 outlets in
the country. China and Hong Kong have become the biggest market
for watches, and the combined wealth of millionaires in Asia may
rise 8.8 percent annually through 2018, according to Capgemini
and Merrill Lynch & Co. Wealthy Chinese consumers own 4.4 luxury
watches on average, according to the  Hurun Wealth Report .  Watch revenue, which accounts for 20 percent of Bulgari’s
sales, fell 11 percent at comparable exchange rates in the
third-quarter. Sales in Asia rose 7.7 percent on the same basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
