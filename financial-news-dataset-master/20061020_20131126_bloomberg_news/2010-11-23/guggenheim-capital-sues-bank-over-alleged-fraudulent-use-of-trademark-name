Guggenheim Capital LLC  and
Guggenheim Partners LLC sued the Vladimir Z. Guggenheim Bank and
a group of individuals, claiming they are illegally using the
Guggenheim name to defraud investors in the U.S.  Pretending to be connected to the Guggenheim financial
firms, the defendants “offer consumers the chance to
participate in multimillion and multibillion dollar investments
involving a variety of products, such as crude oil, bank
guarantees, diamonds and gold,” the Guggenheim firms said in a
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in  Manhattan .  The defendants use a misleading website,
 www.guggenheimadvisors.org , to attract investors, according to
the complaint. The suit seeks an order declaring that the
defendants violated the Guggenheim trademark and awarding
unspecified damages.  Vladimir Z. Guggenheim said today in a phone interview that
the allegations are false.  The case is Guggenheim Capital LLC v. Toumei,
1:10-cv-08830, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
