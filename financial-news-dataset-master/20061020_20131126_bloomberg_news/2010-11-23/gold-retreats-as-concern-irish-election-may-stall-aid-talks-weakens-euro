Gold declined in London as the
dollar strengthened after North and South Korea exchanged
artillery fire. Other precious metals dropped, led by palladium.  The dollar gained against the euro as South Korea’s Joint
Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that North Korea fired
“several” artillery shells into the South near the two
nations’ western border. Gold, which typically moves inversely
to the greenback, reached a record $1,424.60 an ounce on Nov. 9.
All six main industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange
fell.  The stronger dollar “has an impact,” said  Dan Smith , an
analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in London. “A lot of
commodities are off quite badly as people worry about the macro
outlook.”  Immediate-delivery bullion lost $7.75, or 0.6 percent, to
$1,358.70 an ounce at 12:44 p.m. in London. The metal for
December delivery was little changed at $1,358.60 on the Comex
in New York.  A South Korean Defense Ministry official, who declined to
be identified, said the military has been put on high alert,
scrambled fighter jets and will “respond strongly” to further
provocation.  “Political risk is typically a positive for gold, but
losses in commodities this morning are weighing on precious
metals generally,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London,
said in a report. With the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday this week,
“the proximity of year-end and the nagging fear of Chinese
tightening, it is likely that investors across asset classes
will be tempted to accelerate their profit-taking,” she said.  Irish Aid  The euro also weakened against the dollar on speculation an
election in Ireland will hinder the nation’s aid talks with the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Irish Prime
Minister  Brian Cowen  announced yesterday he will seek elections
early next year. Ireland’s rescue package may total 95 billion
euros ($129 billion), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates.  China’s government in the past month stepped up a campaign
to limit credit expansion after inflation quickened and property
prices surged. China’s biggest banks are close to reaching
annual lending quotas and plan to stop expanding their loan
books to avoid exceeding the limits, according to four people
with knowledge of the matter. Copper fell as much as 2.9 percent
in London.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 3.06 metric
tons to 2,084.48 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. Silver holdings gained 62.3 tons to 14,878.6
tons, the highest amount since at least February, data from four
providers show.  Silver for immediate delivery in London lost 2.7 percent to
$27.1038 an ounce. It reached a 30-year high of $29.36 on Nov. 9
and is up 61 percent this year.  Palladium dropped 4.7 percent to $661.75 an ounce. Platinum
was 1.2 percent lower at $1,641.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
