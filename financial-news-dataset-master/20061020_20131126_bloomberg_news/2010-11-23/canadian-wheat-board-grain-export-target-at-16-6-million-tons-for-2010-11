Following are comments and export
targets from  Ward Weisensel , chief operating officer of the
Canadian Wheat Board. The remarks were  posted  on the Winnipeg,
Manitoba-based board’s website.  “Right now we’re looking at only 38 percent of the Canada
Western Red spring wheat crop grading in the top two grades, and
when you look back in history, you really have to go back to
either a combination of ‘04-’05 or ‘05-’06 to find a year that
is similar to the type of quality situation we’re seeing this
year.”  “We really need to be basically moving customers who have
traditionally been buying 1s and 2s into lower grades, like 3s,
to ensure that we can market this crop.”  “We’re only expecting 24 percent of our durum crop
produced this year to be in the top two grades. Again, you have
to go back to ‘02-’03 to see a crop that is even close to that
type of poor quality. Even ‘04-’05 was much better quality than
this crop year.”  “The focus is going to be on moving customers off of 1s
and 2s, which they’ve become used to over the course of the last
four years.”  “The one unknown that is remaining out there on the barley
side is the Australian situation. We already know they’re going
to produce a very large crop, about 8.2 million tons, but what
is not known at this stage is the quality of that crop. Right
now is a critical time for that crop. If they get rains through
this period, it’s going to downgrade that quality, and what
that’s going to mean is more feed supplies on the world market,
but lower malting-barley supplies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
