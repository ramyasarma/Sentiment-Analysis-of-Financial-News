European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell  said the ECB’s lending to
banks has declined, allowing it to exit some of its emergency
measures.  “The size of refinancing operations has decreased
considerably,” Tumpel-Gugerell said in a speech in London
today. “The phasing-out of non-standard measures continued in
the third quarter of 2010 and is still continuing in the fourth
quarter.”  The ECB wants to wean commercial banks off its unlimited
liquidity provision, which was the plank of the central bank’s
fight against the recession. The exit has been complicated by
the Greek and Irish bailouts and concerns about the fiscal
health of countries like Portugal and Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
