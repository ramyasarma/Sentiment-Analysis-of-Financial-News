The Australian dollar traded near
the lowest in more than three weeks as concerns about Ireland’s
debt crisis and mounting tensions in the Korean peninsula damped
demand for higher-yielding currencies.  New Zealand’s dollar was close to a three-week low against
the greenback after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  yesterday
said the euro is in an “exceptionally serious” situation
following Ireland’s request for a financial rescue. The South
Pacific nations’ currencies may slide as a drop in stocks and
commodities weigh on investor appetite for riskier assets.  “Escalating concerns about peripheral Europe overshadowed
all other developments,”  Matthew Strauss , senior currency
strategist in Toronto at Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a
research note today. “The Australian and New Zealand dollars
also struggled in this risk-averse environment.”  Australia’s currency was at 97.33 U.S. cents as of 9:48 a.m.
in Sydney from 97.23 in New York yesterday, when it touched
97.09, the lowest since Oct. 29. The so-called Aussie traded at
80.92 yen from 80.86 yen. New Zealand’s dollar fetched 75.93 U.S.
cents from 75.87, after reaching 75.78 yesterday, the weakest
since Oct. 29. The kiwi was at 63.13 yen from 63.09 yen.  North Korea lobbed artillery shells yesterday at a South
Korean island near the disputed border between the two countries,
killing two soldiers and setting houses ablaze in the worst
attack on its neighbor in at least eight months.  The MSCI World Index fell 1.7 percent yesterday and the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials dropped 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
