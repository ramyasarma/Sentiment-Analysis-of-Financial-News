Gold jumped the most in two weeks on
demand for a haven amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and
escalating tensions between North and South Korea.  The euro headed for the biggest drop since August against
the dollar as credit markets focused on deficits in Spain and
Portugal after Ireland sought a rescue package. North Korea
lobbed artillery shells near South Korea’s border in the worst
attack in at least eight months. Gold has gained 26 percent this
year, reaching a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “People are shedding risk and going to flight-to-quality
assets like gold,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at
LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “People are viciously selling
off the euro on contagion fears and the Korean conflict.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $19.80, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1,377.60 at 1:57 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 4.
The metal advanced 0.4 percent yesterday after declining 3.2
percent in the previous two weeks.  “People are putting money back into metals in a
reinvestment wave,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the prospect of serial
European bailouts was “exceptionally serious” as officials
estimated saving Ireland will cost 85 billion euros ($114
billion).  Gold priced in euros rose to a record in June after a Greek
bailout. Global equities slumped today.  ‘Political Risk’  “Political risk is typically a positive for gold,” said
 Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in London.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 11.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $27.572 an ounce. The metal has jumped 64
percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained $6.40, or
0.9 percent, to $691.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has surged 69 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $2.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,657.70 an ounce. The metal has gained 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
