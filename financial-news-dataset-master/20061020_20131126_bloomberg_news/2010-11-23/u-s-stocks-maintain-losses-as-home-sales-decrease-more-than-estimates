U.S. stocks maintained losses after
existing home sales decreased more than estimated last month,
fueling concern the housing market is struggling to recover.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent to
1,181.65 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average sank 140.77 points, or 1.3 percent, to 11,037.81.  Purchases decreased 2.2 percent to a 4.43 million annual
rate from 4.53 million in September, the National Association of
Realtors said today in Washington. Economists projected sales
would decline to a 4.48 million pace, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The median price fell 0.9
percent from a year earlier.  U.S. stocks followed European shares lower earlier after
North Korea lobbed shells at a South Korean island and concern
grew that Europe’s debt crisis will spread. North Korea sent
“several” artillery shells into South Korea near the two
nations’ western border, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff
said in a statement. South Korea returned fire with 80 shells
and scrambled fighter jets as President Lee Myung Bak vowed to
respond “sternly.”  The S&P 500 has fallen about 3.5 percent from a two-year
high on Nov. 5 amid concern Europe’s debt crisis is intensifying
and growing speculation that China will boost interest rates.
The decline trimmed the gauge’s rally this year to 7.4 percent.  Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s meeting this month, set
for release at 2 p.m. New York time, may help explain why policy
makers decided to supply the world’s largest economy with an
additional $600 billion in monetary stimulus. The report will
also contain policy makers’ updated economic forecasts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
