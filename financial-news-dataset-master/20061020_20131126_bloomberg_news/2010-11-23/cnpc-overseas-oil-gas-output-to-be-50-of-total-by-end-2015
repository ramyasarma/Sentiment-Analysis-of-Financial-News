China National Petroleum Corp., the
country’s biggest oil and gas producer, said it expects overseas
output to account for half of its overall production by the end
of 2015.  Output in Central Asia will expand “rapidly” during the
2011 to 2015 period, the parent of  PetroChina Co.  said in a
statement on its website today. CNPC has operations in 29
countries including Kazakhstan.  PetroChina plans to spend at least $60 billion in the next
decade on overseas takeovers to help meet domestic energy demand.
The CNPC unit completed its purchase of Australian coal-bed gas
producer Arrow Energy Ltd. with Royal Dutch Shell Plc for A$3.5
billion ($3.5 billion) in August and paid C$1.9 billion ($1.9
billion) for a stake in Canadian oil-sands projects in February.  CNPC will also “significantly” expand its overseas
refining capacity in the next five years, the state-controlled
company said in the statement.  PetroChina said in March it has already started taking
initial steps in its acquisition of Scotland’s only oil-
processing plant that would give the Chinese energy producer its
first European refining operation.  The Hong Kong-listed unit plans to step up cooperation with
national oil companies in countries like Venezuela, Russia, Iraq,
Kazakhstan, Chad and Niger, President Zhou Jiping said on Aug.
26. PetroChina will also expand partnerships with major oil
companies including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell and
BP Plc, according to Zhou.  -- Wang Ying . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
