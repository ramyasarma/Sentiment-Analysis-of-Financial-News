Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude for
loading loaded in December and January will be affected by a
force majeure declared by Royal Dutch Shell Plc on Nov. 19 after
a pipeline leak, a company spokesman said.  “We investigated and discovered that the leaks were caused
by crude theft”,  Precious Okolobo , Shell’s spokesman in
Nigeria, said by phone from Lagos. Repairs on the Trans Niger
Pipeline “are progressing but I can’t confirm when they will be
completed”.  The force majeure also affects November loadings
“effective from the time it was declared,” Okolobo said. Force
majeure is a legal clause that allows producers to miss export
obligations because of circumstances beyond their control.  Nigeria had planned to ship 8.9 million barrels of Bonny
crude this month, or 295,000 barrels a day, according to a
preliminary schedule at the end of September. That would be the
most since December 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shell had previously declared force majeure on Bonny
exports in August and September after crude theft caused cargoes
to be delayed. The oil is favored by U.S. refiners because it
yields a high proportion of gasoline when processed.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports. Shell operates a joint
venture in the nation in which it holds a 30 percent stake and
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp owns 55 percent.
Total SA has a 10 percent stake and Eni SpA holds 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
