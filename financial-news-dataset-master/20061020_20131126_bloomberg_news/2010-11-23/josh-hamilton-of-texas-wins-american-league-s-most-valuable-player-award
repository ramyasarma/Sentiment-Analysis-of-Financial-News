Josh Hamilton ’s baseball comeback
has a new chapter. The Texas Rangers’ outfielder was named the
American League’s Most Valuable Player.  Hamilton, who was the first pick in the 1999 amateur draft
yet didn’t reach the major leagues until 2007 because of drug
and alcohol addiction, won his first MVP award even after
missing almost all of September with injured ribs.  “It’s just awesome to think about where I am at this
moment and where I was,” Hamilton, 29, said during a media
conference call. “I would have said there was a 99 percent
chance this would never happen.”  Hamilton received 22 of 28 first-place votes for a total of
358 points in balloting by the  Baseball Writers’ Association of
America , easily outdistancing the Detroit Tigers’  Miguel Cabrera , who got five first-place votes and 262 points. New York
Yankees second baseman  Robinson Cano  finished third with 229
points, followed by the Toronto Blue Jays’  Jose Bautista  (one
first-place vote, 165 points) and the Chicago White Sox’s  Paul Konerko  (130 points).  “It’s an absolutely great honor,” Hamilton said. “There
are a lot of players in the league and to get this award just
speaks volumes.”  Players received 14 points for first place, nine for
second, eight for third, on down to one for 10th in the
balloting that was completed before Major League Baseball’s
postseason.  Hamilton, who had 32 home runs and 100 runs batted in, won
the AL batting title with a .359 average. He also led the league
with a 1.044 on-base plus slugging, or OPS, a statistic that
measures a batter’s ability to get on base and hit for power.  World Series Loss  The result for the Rangers was a 90-72 record and their
first playoff berth since 1999. The team won the AL West
Division by nine games over the Oakland Athletics.  Hamilton missed almost the entire final month of the
season. He fractured his ribs Sept. 4 when he ran into the
center-field wall while fielding a fly ball off the bat of the
Minnesota Twins’  Delmon Young . Hamilton returned Oct. 1 for the
Rangers’ final regular-season series.  Texas went on to win its first playoff series in history
before losing the World Series in five games to the San
Francisco Giants. Hamilton said the team’s success is what he’ll
remember most from this season.  “It was the most fun I’ve ever had with a group of guys
playing toward that one common purpose and goal,” he said.
“That’s rare on the professional level. You say you want to do
it, but to have that right mix of guys, that’s very rare.”  First Pick  Hamilton was the first pick of the 1999 amateur draft by
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, then was slowed by injuries and a car
accident before the 2001 season.  His focus eventually became a life of drug use, leading to
several suspensions and his eventual departure from baseball
between 2004 and 2006.  Tampa cut ties with him in 2006, leaving Hamilton, who said
he got sober in 2005, exposed to the Rule 5 draft. He was taken
by the Chicago Cubs and later that day moved to the Cincinnati
Reds.  He made his major-league debut in 2007, batting .292 with
19 homers and 47 RBI in 90 games before being traded to Texas
the following offseason. Hamilton has been an  All-Star three
straight seasons  with the Rangers, despite having a brief
setback with alcohol in January 2009.  Ginger Ale  When the Rangers clinched their division title and two
playoff series en route to their first World Series appearance,
the team celebrated with ginger ale instead of the traditional
champagne, in support of Hamilton’s sobriety.  He’s the fifth Ranger to win the award, joining  Alex Rodriguez  (2003),  Ivan Rodriguez  (1999),  Juan Gonzalez  (1998,
1996), and  Jeff Burroughs  (1974). He’s the sixth centerfielder
to win the AL honor, following  Joe DiMaggio ,  Mickey Mantle ,  Fred Lynn ,  Robin Yount  and  Ken Griffey Jr .  “I feel like what the MVP is -- and that’s not taking away
from anything the other guys did -- is you want to help your
team win any way possible every single night,” Hamilton said.
“When I was playing this year, I really feel like I did those
things.”  Cano, who won a Gold Glove as the AL’s best defensive
second baseman, batted .319 with 29 home runs and 109 RBI for
the Yankees. His batting average after the All-Star break dipped
to .299 from .336.  Cabrera, Bautista and Konerko may have been hurt by their
teams’ failures to figure in the playoff races.  Home-Run Leader  Bautista, who played mostly outfield, led the major leagues
with 54 home runs, 15 more than AL runner-up Konerko. The total
more than tripled Bautista’s previous high in homers of 16, set
in 2006. He also had 124 RBI and a batting average of .260 for
the Blue Jays, who were 85-77, finishing 11 games back in the AL
East.  Konerko, a 34-year-old first baseman, had 111 RBI and a
.312 batting average for the White Sox, who went 88-74 to finish
six games behind the Minnesota Twins in the AL Central.  Cabrera’s Tigers went 81-81, finishing 13 games back in the
AL Central. His .328 batting average and 38 homers were third in
the AL, and he led the league with 126 RBI and a .420 on-base
percentage.  Cincinnati Reds first-baseman  Joey Votto  was named the
National League’s Most Valuable Player yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
