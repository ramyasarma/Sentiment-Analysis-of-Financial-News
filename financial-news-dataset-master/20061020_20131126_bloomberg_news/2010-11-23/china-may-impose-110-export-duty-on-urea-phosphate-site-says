China may restrict fertilizer
exports by levying peak-season duties of 110 percent on urea and
diammonium phosphate shipments starting Dec. 1, the industry
website Jcce.cn said, citing the China Nitrogen Fertilizer
Industry Association.  Urea exports will be charged the duty between Dec. 1, 2010
and June 30, 2011, the site said. The export duty will be
lowered to 7 percent during the low season between July 1 and
Oct. 31, 2011, before rising to 110 percent for November, it
said.  The duty may be levied on diammonium phosphate exports from
Dec. 1 to May 31, the site said. It will then be lowered to 7
percent from June 1 to Sept. 30, it said. The 110 percent duty
will be reinstated for November and December 2011, it said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
