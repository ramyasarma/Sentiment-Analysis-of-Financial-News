What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade on concern that Europe’s debt crisis
and North Korean tensions will impair the global economy,
eroding demand for commodities, said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
Soybean-meal futures may open steady to $2 lower per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.4 cent to 0.5
cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on concern that demand will ebb for the grain
used to make animal feed, fuel and food, Grow said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on economic concerns and improving prospects for
the U.S. crop, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
