Mobile-telephone users could contact
emergency call centers via text messages under changes to be
discussed by federal regulators, an official said.  The Federal Communications Commission next month will begin
consulting state and local authorities and telecommunications
providers on using text, data, video and photos for emergency
calls, FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said today in a speech in
Arlington, Virginia.  Seventy percent of calls to 911 emergency numbers are made
with mobile phones, the agency said in a news release sent by e-
mail.  New services also could enable emergency calls to be placed
by devices, rather than human beings, Genachowski said,
according to the news release. Environmental sensors capable of
detecting chemicals, highway cameras, security cameras, alarms,
personal medical devices and consumer electronics in automobiles
are among the possibilities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
