Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian shares fell a day after North Korea attacked South
Korea, and concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis and China’s
measures to tame inflation will slow a global economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of  Advantest Corp. , which is
the world’s biggest maker of memory-chip testers and gets more
than 25 percent of its revenue from South Korea, plunged 3.1
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo on Nov. 22.
Japanese markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. ADRs of
Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.,
Japan’s three largest carmakers, tumbled at least 2.4 percent.
BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company, lost 0.7
percent in Sydney today after commodity prices declined.  “Japan will be adversely affected because it’s right in
the center of the conflict,” said  Jamie Coutts , sales manager
at the brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore. “North Korea has
spoken about targeting Japan in the past. Any escalation in
tensions over there directly affects Japan, probably more than
any country in the region other than South Korea itself.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 9,855 in Chicago yesterday, compared with the
gauge’s close of 10,115.19 on Nov. 22. They were bid in the pre-
market at 9,850 in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 0.8 percent today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.3 percent in Wellington.  Korean Conflict  North Korea fired artillery shells yesterday at the South
Korean island of Yeonpyeong near the disputed border between the
two countries, killing two soldiers and setting houses ablaze in
the worst attack on its neighbor in at least eight months. News
of the skirmish broke out after markets in South Korea,
Australia and New Zealand had closed for trading.  South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets as
President  Lee Myung Bak  vowed to respond “sternly.” The clash
came 11 days after North Korea showed a uranium-enrichment plant
to visiting U.S. scientists.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
today. The index slid 1.4 percent yesterday, its biggest
decrease in a week, and more than 15 times as many stocks
declined as advanced.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 8.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.9 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.8 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated  earnings  on
average, compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and 11.8 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for January delivery lost 0.6 percent yesterday
in New York to settle at $81.25 a barrel, and copper futures
dropped 1.1 percent. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1.6
percent yesterday. Gold futures jumped 1.5 percent, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 4.  The yen appreciated to 110.75 against the euro about 1:40
a.m. in Tokyo, its strongest level since Sept. 16. A stronger
yen reduces the value of overseas income at Japanese companies
when converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters for this story:
