Ireland had its long-term sovereign
rating cut to ‘A’ from ‘AA-’ and its short-term rating to ‘A-1’
from ‘A-1+’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which cited
concerns about additional borrowing by the government as it
seeks external aid from the IMF and the European Union.  “The lower ratings reflect our view that the Irish
government looks set to borrow over and above our previous
projections to fund further bank capital injections into
Ireland’s troubled banking system,” S&P said in a statement.  External aid will “not reduce the government’s large
contingent liabilities or eliminate the negative macroeconomic
pressures weighing on asset quality,” it also said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
