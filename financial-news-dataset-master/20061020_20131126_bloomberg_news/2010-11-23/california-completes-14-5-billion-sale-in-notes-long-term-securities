California  wrapped up the sale of
$14.5 billion in short-term notes and longer-maturity securities
to finance public works projects, said  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman
for Treasurer  Bill Lockyer .  Today’s sale of $1.25 billion in tax-exempt bonds capped a
week of offerings that included $10 billion in revenue
anticipation notes and $3.275 billion in taxable general-
obligation bonds, Dresslar said in an e-mail.  California sold after yields on  10-year AAA tax-exempts 
fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.98 percent
on Nov. 19, the first decrease in more than a week, according to
a Bloomberg Fair  Market  Value index. The stabilization followed
a  13 basis point jump  on Nov. 18, the biggest one-day surge
since April 1994.  “Now we can catch our breath and give the market a
breather,” Lockyer said in the e-mail.  The extra yield investors demand above top-rated debt for
five-year general obligations from California issuers  reached 90
basis points  on Nov. 19, the most since July 23, Bloomberg Fair
Market Value data show.  California, the biggest issuer of debt in the municipal
market, is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service, its fifth-
highest grade, and A- by Standard & Poor’s, its fourth-lowest
level for investment-quality securities.  The most-populous U.S. state sold $2.5 billion of tax-
exempts on March 11, with 30-year bonds priced to yield 5.65
percent, or 121 basis points above AAA debt, according to a
Bloomberg Fair Market Value index. The so-called spread narrowed
to about 89 basis points on Nov. 19.  ‘Not Struggling’  “We’re not struggling,” Dresslar said in a statement on
Nov. 19. “We’re doing a job that’s vital to California’s fiscal
and economic health, and doing it at the best possible price for
taxpayers.”  The state completed its sale of $3.275 billion of taxable
debt on Nov. 19, a day after increasing it almost 20 percent
amid demand for yields that exceed those on some lower-rated
corporate bonds.  The sale included $3.025 billion of federally subsidized
Build America Bonds and $250 million of traditional taxable
general-obligation securities. Coupons were set at 3.25
percentage points more than comparable-maturity Treasuries on
$2.11 billion of the Build America debt due in 30 years,
according to Lockyer’s office. That’s a yield of about 7.52
percent.  Earlier in the week,  California  was forced to raise yields
on $10 billion of short-term notes it sold and had to offer
rates on taxable debt that exceed those on some lower-rated
corporate bonds amid the surge in municipal issuance.  “It’s interesting to me that an entity with a $25 billion
deficit over the next 18 months doesn’t pay much of a rate
penalty,”  Jon Schotz , co-managing partner at Saybrook Capital
in Santa Monica, California, who oversees more than $300 million
in municipal bonds, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
