Four opposition candidates in
Burkina Faso who ran against President  Blaise Compaore  in a Nov.
21 election claimed there were “irregularities” in the vote
and said they wouldn’t accept results when they are announced.  Some people were allegedly allowed to vote without
identification cards while others were able to cast more than
one ballot, Benewende Stanislas Sankara, one of the candidates,
told reporters in  Ouagadougou , the capital, today.  Compaore, 59, is seeking to extend his 23-year rule of
Africa’s biggest cotton producer and one of the world’s poorest
countries. Moussa Michel Tapsoba, president of the country’s
electoral commission, said in a phone interview the opposition
candidates were “bad losers” and should present legal proof of
their claims.  The election was “free” and “transparent”, said  Anicet Georges Dologuele , head of the African Union’s observer mission
in the country and a former prime minster of the Central African
Republic. Voter turnout was low, he told journalists today,
without giving further details.  Results will probably be announced by Nov. 25, according to
the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
