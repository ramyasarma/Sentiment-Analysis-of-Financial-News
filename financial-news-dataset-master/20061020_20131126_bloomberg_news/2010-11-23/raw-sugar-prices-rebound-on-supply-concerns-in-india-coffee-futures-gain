Sugar jumped more than 3 percent on
renewed supply concerns in India, the world’s second-biggest
producer. Coffee also rose.  Output in the state of Maharashtra, India’s largest
producer of refined sugar, dropped 29 percent from Oct. 1 to
Nov. 20 from a year earlier as heavy rains slowed the harvest,
an industry group said yesterday. Brazil is the leading
producer. Sugar prices have more than doubled from this year’s
low in May, partly on concern that a drought in Brazil damaged
crops.  Sugar is “running on its own fundamentals,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago. “People are trying to stay long.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.83 cent, or 3.1
percent, to settle at 27.33 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Yesterday, the price gained 1.3
percent. On May 7, the sweetener touched 13 cents, the 2010 low.  Earlier, sugar tumbled as much as 4 percent. Most
commodities dropped amid concern that Europe’s debt woes and
escalating tensions between North and South Korea would impair
the global economy, eroding demand for raw materials.  Europe and Korea spurred “a sprint to safe assets, like
bonds, the dollar, the Swiss Franc and gold,”  Michael McDougall , a vice president at Newedge USA in New York, said in
a report.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery rose
$7.30, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $681 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for March delivery
advanced 3.4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.1055 a pound. The
price has climbed 55 percent this year.  Robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose $5, or 0.3
percent, to $1,853 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
