New York, the most-populous U.S.
city, plans to sell $875 million in taxable municipal debt next
month, including $745 million in Build America Bonds.  A $130 million portion will be offered via competitive
sale, according to a press release today from the city’s Office
of Management and Budget. Underwriters led by  JPMorgan Chase &
Co.  will market the Build America debt, which includes a 35
percent federal subsidy on interest costs.  The issue, backed by the full faith and credit of New York
City, is rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, and AA by
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, all third-highest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
