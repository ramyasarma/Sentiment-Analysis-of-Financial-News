Spanish and Portuguese banks
dropped, led by  Banco Santander SA  and  Banco Espirito Santo SA ,
on concern more countries seeking to shore up their public
finances may need to be bailed out after Ireland.  Santander, Spain’s largest bank, slid 4.7 percent to 7.80
euros in Madrid trading, following a 4 percent decline
yesterday.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , the country’s
second-biggest lender, fell 3.9 percent to 7.63 euros. Espirito
Santo retreated 3.5 percent to 3.03 euros in Lisbon.  Ireland became the second euro country after Greece to seek
a rescue as it struggled with costs to save its banks from
collapse. That raised speculation whether Portugal and Spain
will be forced to follow suit in a process that may threaten the
survival of the euro currency.  “Investors basically think the other peripheral countries
are at risk and the Irish bailout is not going to solve their
problems,”  Andrew Lim , an analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital
LLP in London, said in a phone interview. “Think of a Banco
Santander denominated in pesetas and it’s not a pretty sight.”  Bank shares declined across Europe today, with  Bank of
Ireland  Plc slumping 23 percent to 30 cents, extending
yesterday’s 19 percent drop. The Stoxx 600 Banks Index slid 2.3
percent to 195.33, the lowest level since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
