Anthony W. Ling , head of European
equity research at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , is moving into a
new role and handing off responsibilities to three deputies,
according to three people familiar with the situation.  Ling, who has overseen the research since 2000, will focus
on other investment research initiatives including  GS Sustain ,
the product centered on companies that pursue socially and
environmentally sustainable policies, said two of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public. He
joined the bank in 1999 and has been a partner since 2002.  Patrick Hargreaves ,  John Sawtell  and  Richard Tufft  are
taking over his responsibilities, the people said. Tufft was
elected to become a partner last week, while Hargreaves and
Sawtell are both managing directors, one level below partner.  Sophie Bullock , a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs in London, said she couldn’t comment.  Financial News 
reported Ling’s decision to step down from running European
equity research earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
