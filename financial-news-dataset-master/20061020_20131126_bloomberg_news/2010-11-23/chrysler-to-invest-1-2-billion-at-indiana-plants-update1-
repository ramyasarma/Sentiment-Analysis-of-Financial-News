Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by Fiat SpA, said it’s looking to invest $843
million in its manufacturing plants in Kokomo, Indiana, to
produce a new front-wheel drive automatic transmission.  The automaker, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, is working
with Friedrichshafen, Germany-based ZF Group on the
transmission. The planned investment follows a total of $343
million Chrysler said in May and June it will devote to the
Kokomo operation.  “For years, Kokomo has been at the center of our power-
train strategy, and the potential of an additional investment
reaffirms that position,”  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive
officer of Chrysler and Fiat, said in a statement today.  The front-wheel drive transmission, along with the
previously announced eight-speed transmission Chrysler will also
produce in Kokomo, “will transform our future products and
position them as leaders in marketplace,” he said.  The investments depend upon the Kokomo City Council
approving a tax-abatement application on Dec. 13, Chrysler said.  President  Barack Obama  is scheduled to visit the
transmission complex today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
