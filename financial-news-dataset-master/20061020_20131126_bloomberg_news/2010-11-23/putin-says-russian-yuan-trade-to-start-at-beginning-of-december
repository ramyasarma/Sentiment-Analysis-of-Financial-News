The Chinese yuan will start trading
on Russian exchanges at the start of December, after China
allowed the yuan to trade against the ruble in the interbank
market from Nov. 22, Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  “Previously our countries used foreign currencies in
trade,” Putin told reporters today in St. Petersburg today
after talks with China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao . “This is a serious
step toward creating better conditions for trade and economic
relations.”  In the wake of the global financial crisis, China and
Russia have called for the dollar’s role in the financial system
to be diluted. Volatility in major currencies is putting the
global recovery at risk,  Zhang Ping , the head of China’s
National Development and Reform Commission, has said.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  has promoted use of the
ruble in trade and as a regional reserve currency. He has also
repeatedly called for a supranational currency to compete with
the dollar.  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, reached an agreement
with Export-Import Bank of China on opening a $2 billion credit
line, Putin said. The money will be used to finance “major joint
economic projects,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
