More than 1.2 million people began
taking anti-HIV drugs last year, an increase of 30 percent, as
the number of new infections declined for a 12th straight year.  About 2.6 million people contracted the AIDS-causing virus
worldwide last year, 19 percent less than in 1997 when the
number of new infections peaked, the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS, or  UNAIDS , said its annual report today.
AIDS-related deaths fell to 1.8 million last year from a peak of
2.1 million in 2004, the Geneva-based agency said.  “We have halted and begun to reverse the epidemic,”
 Michel Sidibe , executive director of UNAIDS, said in the report.
“Fewer people are becoming infected with HIV and fewer people
are dying from AIDS.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
