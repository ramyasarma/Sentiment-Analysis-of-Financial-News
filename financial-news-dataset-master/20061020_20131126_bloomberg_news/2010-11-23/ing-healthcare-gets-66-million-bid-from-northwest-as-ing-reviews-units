(Corrects to remove name of second bidder in first
paragraph after company revises earlier statement.)  ING Real Estate Healthcare Fund  has
received a A$67.1 million ($66.2 million) takeover bid from
Toronto-based NorthWest Value Partners Inc.  The offer to acquire all of ING Healthcare Fund’s shares
for 94 Australian cents a unit is “highly conditional,” ING
Management Ltd. said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. The bid values the fund at a discount to its net
tangible assets per unit of 98 Australian cents, it said.  The board of ING “has not formed a view at this stage as
to the merits of the proposal and there is no guarantee that any
formal, binding proposal for all of the issued units in IHF will
be received,” the company said in the statement. “Accordingly,
unitholders should take no action at this time.”  The bid follows an offer from a consortium led by  Goodman
Group  last month for ING Industrial Fund. Netherlands-based ING
Groep NV, which is seeking to divest its global real estate unit,
has said it is conducting a review of its five real-estate funds
in Australia.  ING Healthcare Fund jumped 9.6 percent to close at 85.5
Australian cents in Sydney trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
