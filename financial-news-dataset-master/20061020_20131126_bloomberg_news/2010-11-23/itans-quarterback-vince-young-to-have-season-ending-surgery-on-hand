Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince
Young will undergo season-ending surgery to repair a torn flexor
tendon his throwing hand, coach Jeff Fisher said.       Young hurt his thumb during the third quarter of
yesterday’s 19-16 overtime loss to the Washington Redskins.
He’ll be placed on season-ending injured reserve.   Young, who was replaced at quarterback by rookie Rusty
Smith, threw his shoulder pads and jersey into the stands while
leaving the field after the game, the Tennessean reported. He
also walked out of the Titans’ locker room without talking to
the media, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
