Treasury futures rose for a third
day as artillery fire between North Korea and South Korea
increased demand for the relative safety of government debt.  “It’s a risk-aversion trade,” said  Andy Cossor , the Hong
Kong-based chief market strategist for Asia at DZ Bank AG,
Germany’s fifth-largest lender.  The yield on 10-year futures contracts for December
delivery declined four basis points to 3.03 percent as of 6:41
a.m. in London, based on electronic transactions at the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price rose 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face
amount, to 125 1/2.  Futures rallied after Yonhap News reported North Korea
fired tens of artillery shells near the western border with
South Korea, prompting the South’s military to fire back.  Trading in Japan was closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
