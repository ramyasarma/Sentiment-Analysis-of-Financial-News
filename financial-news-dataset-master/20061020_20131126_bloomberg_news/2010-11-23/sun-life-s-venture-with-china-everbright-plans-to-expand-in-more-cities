Sun Life Financial Inc. , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, plans to expand in more cities in China
through its venture with China Everbright Group, Chief Executive
Officer Donald Stewart said.  Sun Life operates in 18 cities with 2,000 agents through
the partnership, the Toronto-based insurer told investors today.  “There are excellent prospects, partially driven by the
strong domestic savings cultures,” Stewart said. Business in
India also will “significantly accelerate growth” for the
insurer, he said.  Sun Life reported this month that third-quarter profit was
C$453 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
net loss of C$140 million, or 25 cents. Sun Life fell 70 cents,
or 2.4 percent, to C$28.62 in trading yesterday on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
