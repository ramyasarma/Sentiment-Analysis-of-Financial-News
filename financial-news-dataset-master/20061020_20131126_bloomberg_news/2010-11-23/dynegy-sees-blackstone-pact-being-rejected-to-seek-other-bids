Dynegy Inc. said it intends to start
an open strategic alternatives process to solicit proposals from
potentially interested parties and carefully review its
standalone restructuring alternatives, if stockholders do not
vote to adopt the proposal under which an affiliate of
Blackstone Group agreed to acquire Dynegy for $5 per share in
cash.  At this time, Dynegy anticipates that the proposal will not
receive the necessary votes to be adopted. Blackstone and Dynegy
therefore intend to terminate the merger agreement.  As part of the open strategic alternatives process,
Dynegy’s financial advisors will contact a broad group of
potential strategic and financial buyers, including Seneca
Capital and Icahn Associates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
