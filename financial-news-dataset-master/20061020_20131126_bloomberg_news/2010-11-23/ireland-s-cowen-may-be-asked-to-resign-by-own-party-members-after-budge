Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen 
may be asked to resign by some members of his Fianna Fail party
as the parliament prepares to pass the country’s 2011 budget, a
lawmaker in the party said.  “Tonight I’ll be telling him that I’ve lost confidence in
you, the public has lost confidence in you and for the sake of
the country and the party, give us an indication when you will
resign and let us select somebody to lead us into the next
election,” Noel O’Flynn told Bloomberg News in Dublin today.
“Several members will stand up and ask him to go after the
budget” on Dec. 7.  Cowen’s position is weakening as he opens formal
negotiations with the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund over a rescue package to help stabilize the
country’s banking system. Fianna Fail lawmakers will meet
tonight, a day after the Green Party, Cowen’s junior coalition
partners, called for a January election, saying he “misled’
voters over the past two weeks.  Cowen said last night that he will seek national elections
early next year after passing the budget and completing talks
with the EU and the IMF.  ‘‘The people in this country are angry, they feel betrayed,
let down,’’ O’Flynn said. ‘‘What has happened with the Green
Party leaving the coalition now, they are doing that because of
trust. They were kept in the dark last week, along with, I
believe, several members of cabinet.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
