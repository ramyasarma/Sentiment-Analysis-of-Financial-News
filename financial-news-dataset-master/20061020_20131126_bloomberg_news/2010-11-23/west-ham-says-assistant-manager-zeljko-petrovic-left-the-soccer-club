West Ham United, bottom club in
English soccer’s Premier League, said it “parted company” with
assistant manager Zeljko Petrovic.  “The club would like to thank Zeljko for his efforts
during his four months at the Boleyn Ground and wish him well
for the future,” the Hammers said in a statement on their
website.  Media reports have suggested former West Ham players Paolo
Di Canio or Steve Lomas could return to the club to assist coach
Avram Grant.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
