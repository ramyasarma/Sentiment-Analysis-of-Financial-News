Canadian stocks  fell for a second
day as energy, base-metal and financial shares declined on
concerns the European debt crisis will impair the global
recovery and Chinese banks will cut back on lending.  Suncor Energy Corp., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
lost 2.7 percent as the  U.S. Dollar Index  climbed to the highest
level since September. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s
biggest lender by assets, decreased 1.5 percent after two
officials familiar with negotiations said Ireland may need 85
billion euros ($114 billion) in a rescue package. Teck Resources
Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal producer, retreated
4.1 percent as copper and zinc fell.  The S&P/TSX dropped 135.26 points, or 1.1 percent, the most
in seven days, to 12,793.75.  “Global events are rattling confidence a bit,” said
 Mathieu Roy , a money manager at Louisbourg Investments Inc. in
Moncton, New Brunswick, which oversees C$1.5 billion ($1.46
billion). “Energy and base metals are particularly impacted by
global growth and specifically by China.”  The benchmark has declined 2 percent since Nov. 8 after
surging 14 percent in the prior four months. The rally has
trailed off as concern has mounted that more European countries
will have trouble paying their debts and China twice increased
reserve requirements for banks.  China’s largest banks are approaching government limits on
lending for the year and plan to stop expanding their loan
books, according to four people with knowledge of the matter who
spoke on condition of anonymity. China is the world’s second-
biggest energy consumer behind the U.S. and largest user of
industrial metals.  Energy Prices  Crude oil for January delivery lost 0.6 percent, while
natural gas slipped 0.2 percent.  Suncor decreased 2.7 percent to C$33.95. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, retreated 2.2 percent to C$39.10. Talisman Energy Inc.,
an oil and gas producer with operations in North America, the
North Sea and Indonesia, fell 2.6 percent to C$19.45.  Twelve of 13 companies in an  index  of S&P/TSX base-metals
and coal producers dropped. Teck declined 4.1 percent, the most
since July 5, to C$48.82. Lundin Mining Corp., which produces
base metals in Europe, lost 5.1 percent to C$6.34.  The MSCI World/Financials Index slumped to a two-month low
after European officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the talks are private, said the European Union and
International Monetary Fund may need to provide 50 billion euros
for the Irish government and 35 billion euros for Irish banks.  Royal Bank, Manulife  In Canada, Royal Bank slipped 1.5 percent to C$54. Bank of
Nova Scotia, the country’s third-largest bank, retreated 1.6
percent to C$53.33. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s
fourth-biggest insurer, fell 3.4 percent to C$14.38.  The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  climbed for a fifth day as the
precious metal rose 1.5 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer
increased 1.7 percent to C$51.95 after receiving an
“overweight” rating in new coverage from  Patrick Chidley , an
analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. Centerra Gold Inc., which mines in
Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, advanced 4.1 percent to C$17.71.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. fell 9.1 percent to C$1.59 for the
biggest decline in the S&P/TSX. The platinum miner with
operations in South Africa said it would sell 195 million shares
at C$1.55 to raise C$302.3 million.  CIC Energy Corp., a Nassau, Bahamas-based company
developing a coal mine and power plant in Africa, soared 32
percent to a two-year high of C$6.86 after agreeing to be
acquired by JSW Energy Ltd. of Mumbai. JSW is to pay C$7.42 a
share for CIC Energy.  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the owner of Mac’s and
Circle K convenience stores, climbed 2.7 percent to C$25.95. The
company said it earned 56 cents a share in the second quarter,
beating the average of seven analyst estimates by  13 percent ,
