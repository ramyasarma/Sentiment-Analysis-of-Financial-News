Cotton shipments from India, the
biggest grower after China, may not fill the quota set by the
government as some exporters fail to secure supplies amid lower
arrivals and record prices, according to Olam International Ltd.  Exports may be 2 million bales, 62 percent less than 5.24
million bales permitted to be shipped by Dec. 15, said Unupom
Kausik, head of the cotton business at Olam Agro India Ltd., a
unit of one of the world’s three largest suppliers.  Reduced supplies from the Asian country, the second-biggest
shipper, may tighten global inventories amid rising demand from
China. Cotton prices have climbed 51 percent this year in New
York, reaching a record $1.5195 cents a pound on Nov. 10, amid
plunging  stockpiles  in the U.S., the leading exporter.  Lower shipments “will definitely impact global as well as
domestic prices,” Kausik said in an interview.  India’s government in mid-October set the export quota for
the 2010-2011 season at 5.24 million bales and said the entire
quantity must be sold in 45 days starting Nov. 1. Louis Dreyfus
Commodities, Cargill Inc. and Olam are among companies that won
permits. The limit may be reviewed in December, Farm Minister
 Sharad Pawar  said last month.  About 4.69 million bales have arrived in domestic markets
since Oct. 1, down from 4.81 million a year ago, as heavy rain
slowed harvests,  Cotton Corp. of India , the country’s biggest
buyer, said yesterday. Daily arrivals were 140,000 bales of 170
kilograms each, it said.  ‘Fewer Goods’  Shippers need as many as 120,000 bales daily to fill the
export quota and mills require 2.2 million bales every month,
 Prem Malik , vice chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile
Industry, a trade body, said in a phone interview.  “We’re talking of about 9 million bales to be purchased in
total during the Nov. 1-Dec. 15 period,” he said. “Fewer goods
are being chased by too many. This kind of a crisis is being
seen for the first time since 1982-1983.”  Prices of Shankar-6, a medium staple variety, jumped to a
record 47,000 rupees ($1,031) per candy in October, from 23,000
rupees a year earlier, said D.K. Nair, secretary general of the
textile group. A candy weighs 356 kilograms.  The surge has led to some exporters defaulting on their
commitments as they are unable to buy cotton locally at prices
lower than those they had agreed to sell at, Olam’s Kausik said.
Only 800,000 bales have left the country as of Nov. 16, he said.  Apparel Protests  “The confirmed sales which are in place between buyers and
sellers, and are profitable, will be performed upon,” he said.
“Unprofitable sales have already been defaulted upon.”  India’s apparel industry, comprising 50,000 units, closed
their facilities for a day on Nov. 19 to protest against yarn
prices that have almost doubled in the past year, the  Apparel
Export Promotion Council  said in a statement that day.  The group called for a ban on shipments on cotton yarn to
bolster local supplies, as even the nation’s output is forecast
to increase.  Production may reach 35.7 million bales this season after
farmers planted a record area, the  Cotton Association of India 
said Nov. 16. That compares with the group’s estimate of 34.45
million in September and 32.55 million predicted by the nation’s
 Cotton Advisory Board .  To contact the reporters on this story:
