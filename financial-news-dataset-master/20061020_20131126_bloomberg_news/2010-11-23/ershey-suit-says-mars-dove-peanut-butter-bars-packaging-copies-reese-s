Hershey Co. , the maker of Reese’s
candies, said Mars Inc.’s Dove peanut butter and chocolate bars
copy its packaging, while Mars sought a court ruling that it
isn’t infringing Hershey’s trademarks.  Mars used an orange background for its Dove confection that
was already trademarked for Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and
Reese’s Pieces, Hershey said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in
federal court in Pennsylvania.  The use of the colors is an attempt to “trade on Hershey’s
goodwill and to confuse consumers as to the origin, source or
sponsorship of defendant’s  product ,” the Hershey, Pennsylvania-
based company said in its complaint.  Mars filed its own complaint yesterday against Hershey in
Virginia federal court, claiming “orange is commonly used by
third parties on packaging as a generic flavor designation for
peanuts, peanut butter or peanut butter flavoring.”  Elizabeth Sourk, a spokeswoman for McLean, Virginia-based
Mars, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Hershey rose 8 cents to $46.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . Mars is closely held.  The cases are Hershey Co. v. Mars Inc., 10-02417, U.S.
District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania; and Mars Inc.
v. Hershey Co., 10-01325, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Virginia (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
