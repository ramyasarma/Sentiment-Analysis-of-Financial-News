Nationwide Building Society, the
U.K.’s largest customer-owned lender, said that while house
prices will drop next year, low interest rates will prevent the
the decline from matching the falls of 2008.  Britain’s housing market has “weakened noticeably” in the
last six months and there will be “a continuation of a modest
downward trend at the end of this year and into next year,”
Chief Executive Officer  Graham Beale  told reporters on a
conference call today. “Large house-price falls in the
magnitude of 2008 are unlikely,” because interest rates won’t
rise until “late 2011,” he added.  British house prices declined by 18 percent from 2008 to
2009 and have since recovered half that fall, according to
Nationwide’s house price  index . Nationwide expanded during the
financial crisis by acquiring lenders including the Derbyshire,
Cheshire and Dunfermline building societies, which were
struggling with bad loans and higher funding costs.  The government’s fiscal tightening is likely to depress
housing demand while the number of properties for sale is
significantly higher than last year, the Swindon, England-based
firm said today in a statement.  Banks approved the smallest number of loans in 19 months in
October, the British Bankers’ Association said in a separate
statement today. The number of loans for house purchases fell to
30,766 from 31,058 in September, the BBA said.  Accounting Gain  Nationwide’s net income rose to 197 million pounds ($313
million) in the six months to Sept. 30 from 102 million pounds a
year earlier, it said. The company had a 118 million-pound
accounting gain related to derivatives and hedging, while bad-
loan charges declined 44 percent to 179 million pounds.  The building society had an 11 percent share of total U.K.
mortgage balances in 2009, compared with 28 percent for  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc  and about 14 percent for Banco Santander SA,
according to the  Council of Mortgage Lenders .  Nationwide provided 6 billion pounds of gross residential
loans in the first half, from 5.8 billion pounds in the same
period last year, increasing its market share to 8.5 percent
from 8.3 percent. Net residential mortgage lending fell by 1.8
billion pounds as customers repaid loans, it said. Commercial
gross lending was unchanged at 0.8 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
