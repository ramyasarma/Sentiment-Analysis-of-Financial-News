The euro may drop below $1.30 for
the first time since September after posting a so-called outside
down day, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said, citing trading patterns.  The euro yesterday posted intra-day highs and lows that
surpassed levels from the previous session and closed 0.3
percent lower, signaling further declines, the bank said. A
break of last week’s low of $1.3448 would target a drop toward
$1.32, said Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst
with JPMorgan. Europe’s common currency may fall to $1.29 if it
drops through support near $1.32, O’Connor said.  “The fact that the market is struggling to move higher
suggests that the underlying set up is still weak and there’s
risk for more downside,” he said in a telephone interview.
“After yesterday’s reversal it’s more likely that we do see
some additional weakness.”  The euro traded at $1.3572 as of 9:37 a.m. in Singapore
from $1.3627 in New York yesterday. It reached $1.3448 on Nov.
16, the least since Sept. 28.  The $1.32 area includes support near the uptrend line from
the June 7 low of $1.1877, the weakest since March 2006. The
common currency last traded at $1.29 on Sept. 14. It then rose
in each of the next five weeks.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
