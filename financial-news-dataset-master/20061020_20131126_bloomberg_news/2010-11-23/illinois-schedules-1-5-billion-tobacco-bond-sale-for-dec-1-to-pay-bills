Illinois , which shares Moody’s
Investors Service’s worst state credit rating with California,
has set a Dec. 1 sale for $1.5 billion of tobacco bonds to pay
bills and balance its budget, said  Kelly Kraft , spokeswoman for
Governor  Pat Quinn’s  office of management and budget.  The bonds, being sold by the Railsplitter Tobacco
Settlement Authority, will be backed by money from a 1998
settlement with tobacco companies. The state is raising the cash
to help pay leftover fiscal 2010 bills by Dec. 31.  Comptroller  Dan Hynes  warned in an October report last
month that failure to sell the bonds and collect other short-
term revenue may make it hard to meet the deadline to eliminate
$2 billion of 2010 debt. The 2011 fiscal year began July 1 and
Illinois has a “lapse” period to settle outstanding liability.  The state’s failure to address its budget gap has boosted
its borrowing costs as much as $551 million a year, according to
an Aug. 30  report  from the Civic Federation, a Chicago
government watchdog  Illinois has an A1 rating from Moody’s, the same as
California, and A+ from Standard & Poor’s, the fifth-highest
level from both.  To contact the reporter on this story:
