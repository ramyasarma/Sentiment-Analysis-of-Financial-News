U.S. airline flight attendants are
getting the same exemption from body-scanner checks that pilots
began receiving under a directive that went out Nov. 19, the
Transportation Security Administration said.  “Flight attendants, like pilots, are a known and trusted
group,”  Nicholas Kimball , an agency spokesman, said in an e-
mail today. The attendants and pilots must continue to go
through metal detectors, under agency guidelines.  There are more than 400 body scanners at 70 U.S. airports
that screeners use to detect any non-metal weapons hidden
beneath passengers’ clothing. Passengers who opt out of going
through the body scanners are subject to pat-down searches.  Since crew members don’t need to go through body scanners,
they are also exempt from the pat-downs that would normally
result from skipping scanners. Anyone who sets off a metal
detector is still subject to additional security measures, such
as a pat-down.  U.S. airline pilots starting next year will be exempt from
all physical checks at airport security checkpoints with proof
of identity, the agency said Nov. 19. Flight attendants have
been in talks with the agency about a similar plan.  To contact the reporter for this story:
