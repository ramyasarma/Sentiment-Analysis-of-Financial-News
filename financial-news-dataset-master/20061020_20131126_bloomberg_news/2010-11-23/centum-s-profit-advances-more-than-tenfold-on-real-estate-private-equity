Centum Investment Co. Ltd. , Kenya’s
largest investment company, climbed the most in more than a week
after first-half profit increased more than tenfold on improved
performances from its private equity and real estate operations.  The company’s stock climbed as much as 3.3 percent before
trading 2.2 percent higher at 23 shillings as of 11:50 a.m. in
the capital, Nairobi.  Net income for the six months through September advanced to
845 million shillings ($10.5 million), or 1.53 shillings per
share, from 73 million shillings, or 0.13 shillings per share, a
year earlier, Chief Executive Officer  James Mworia  told
reporters in Nairobi today. Total income jumped to 969 million
shillings from 303 million shillings, he said.  “The improved performance was driven by a significant
improvement in investment income from both the private equity
and real estate business lines,” Mworia said. “All revenue
lines went up.”  Centum plans to grow its total portfolio to 30 billion
shillings by 2014, from 11.8 billion shillings at the end of
September, Mworia said. The company also further plans to reduce
the proportion of investments in Kenya to 50 percent by 2014
from 97 percent at the moment, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
