Changi Airport of Singapore
approached  Fondiaria-Sai SpA  about buying its stake in the
company that controls Rome Airport, daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Changi adviser Nomura approached Fondiaria-Sai about the
almost 4.2 percent stake in  Gemina SpA , according to the Italian
newspaper. A shareholder group controls part of the holding,
Il Sole reported.  The offer is “far” from the asking price and Changi may
have to pay a premium to the market price to secure the stake,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
