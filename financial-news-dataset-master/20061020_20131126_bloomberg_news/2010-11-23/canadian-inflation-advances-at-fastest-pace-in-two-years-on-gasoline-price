Canada’s  consumer prices  advanced at
the fastest pace in two years last month, exceeding all
economist forecasts, as gasoline prices surged.  Consumer prices  rose 2.4 percent in October after a 1.9
percent gain in September, Statistics Canada said. The core
rate, which  excludes eight volatile items  such as gasoline,
quickened to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent. Economists forecast
inflation would be 2.2 percent and the core rate 1.5 percent,
according to the median of 23 estimates in a  Bloomberg News
survey . The maximum forecast for overall inflation was 2.3
percent.  The Bank of Canada  said last month  inflation will average
2.1 percent in the October-December period, and core prices will
advance 1.6 percent. The central bank kept its key lending rate
at 1 percent Oct. 19 after three prior increases, and said
“slack” in the economy won’t be used up until the end of 2012.  “It’s certainly quite broad-based pressure, it’s quite
surprising given the Canadian dollar and disinflation trends
south of the border,” said  Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at
Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “The Bank of Canada is still
worried about the outlook and the risks to the global economy,”
he said, adding the central bank will likely stay “on the
sidelines for a while.”  The Canadian dollar fell 0.1 percent to C$1.0195 per U.S.
dollar at 7:40 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0187
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 98.09 U.S. cents.  Gasoline Prices  Gasoline prices accounted for about half the increase in
the annual inflation rate, gaining 8.8 percent in October from a
year earlier, Statistics Canada said. Overall  energy prices 
advanced 9.1 percent on the year as natural gas rose 11 percent
and electricity by 8.1 percent.  Passenger vehicle prices rose 4.9 percent, as did homeowner
replacement costs, while property taxes increased 3.5 percent,
the agency said in its report.  The Bank of Canada also said last month that sales tax
increases in Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia will
quicken inflation by 0.7 percentage point from July to June
2011.  On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in October after a 0.2 percent gain the previous month.
The core rate also advanced by 0.4 percent in October, the
fastest since February. Economists predicted that monthly prices
would rise 0.2 percent, and the core rate would increase 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
