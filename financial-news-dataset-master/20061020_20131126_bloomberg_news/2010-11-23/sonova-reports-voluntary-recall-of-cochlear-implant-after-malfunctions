Sonova Holding AG  fell the most in
two years in Zurich trading after voluntarily recalling a
hearing aid because of a malfunction that led to “severe pain,
overly loud sounds and/or shocking sensations” in two cases.  Sonova dropped 9.30 francs, or 7 percent, to 124.40 francs
at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading, giving the Staefa,
Switzerland-based company a market value of 8.2 billion Swiss
francs ($8.3 billion). The decline was the biggest since Nov. 6,
2008.  Sonova will remove the HiRes 90K cochlear implant, made by
its Advanced Bionics unit, from the market and work with the
U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  to resolve the “rare
malfunction,” Sonova said in a statement. It’s too early to
predict the impact on full-year sales and operating income, the
company said.  “Bad news for Sonova,”  Christoph Gubler , an analyst at
Bank Vontobel in Zurich, said in a research note. “The short-
term financial impact from the recall will be small. But the
long-term ‘buy’ case of many investors is based on a success of
Advanced Bionics.”  Sonova agreed to buy Advanced Bionics in November 2009 for
$489 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
