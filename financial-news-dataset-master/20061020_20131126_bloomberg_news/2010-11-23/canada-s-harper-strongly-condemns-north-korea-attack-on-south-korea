Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said he “strongly condemned” a military attack by North
Korea on South Korea.  “This is the latest in a series of aggressive and
provocative actions by North Korea, which continue to represent
a grave threat to international security and stability in
northeast Asia,” Harper said in a statement emailed to
reporters. He called it an “unprovoked attack” and offered
Canada’s “firm support” to South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
