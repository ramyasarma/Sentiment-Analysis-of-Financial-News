French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
would lose an election against three potential opponents from
the Socialist Party, with International Monetary Fund managing
director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  holding the largest margin, a
poll said.  If the vote set for 2012 were held today, Strauss-Kahn
would beat Sarkozy by 59 percent to 41 percent in the second
round, while Socialist Party leader  Martine Aubry  would win by
52-48 and former party leader  Francois Hollande  would win 53-47,
according to the survey by Ifop. Sarkozy would tie 50-50 with
 Segolene Royal , whom he beat in 2007.  Centrist candidate  Francois Bayrou  would win at most 9.5
percent, former Prime Minister  Dominique De Villepin  8.5 percent
and anti-immigrant National Front leader Marine Le Pen 13
percent. Sarkozy is credited with between 24 and 27 percent in
the first round, depending on the Socialist candidate.  The Socialist Party plans a primary late next year to chose
its candidate.  The Ifop poll for magazine Paris Match involved 811
registered voters interviewed on the 18th and 19th of November.
