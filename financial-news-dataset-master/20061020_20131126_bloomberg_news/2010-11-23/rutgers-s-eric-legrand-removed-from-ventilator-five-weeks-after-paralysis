Eric LeGrand, a junior on the
Rutgers University football team who suffered a spinal cord
injury during a college game last month, has been removed
from a ventilator and can breathe on his own.  The 20-year-old defensive tackle from Avenel, New
Jersey, was paralyzed from the neck down in an Oct. 16 game
against Army while making a tackle on special teams. The
injury recently was reclassified to incomplete from
complete, meaning that LeGrand had not suffered a complete
loss of function below the damaged area, Rutgers said in a
statement on its athletics  website .  “We want to thank everyone for all the love and
support for Eric, it has really been beneficial to his
recovery,” the LeGrand family said in the statement.
“Please continue to keep Eric in your prayers.”  LeGrand is in rehabilitation at the Kessler Institute
in West Orange, New Jersey. He recently was visited by
former Penn State University defensive back Adam
Taliaferro, who also suffered a spinal cord injury while
playing football in 2000, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
