Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ’s
borrowing costs may rise after the company sold $1 billion in
bonds to help it buy back stock following Canada’s rejection of
BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion bid for the fertilizer maker.  Potash Corp.’s first debt sale in 14 months consisted of
$500 million each of 7- and 30-year bonds. The world’s biggest
fertilizer maker said on Nov. 17 it planned to repurchase as
much as $2 billion in shares after Melbourne-based BHP abandoned
its hostile bid.  Yields on Potash debt have fallen relative to government
bonds since the BHP bid was announced in August and may not
reflect the higher balance-sheet risk posed by the share
repurchase, said  Carol Levenson , an analyst with Gimme Credit
LLC in Chicago. The company’s credit default swaps have been
among the worst performing in Canada in the last five trading
days, reflecting increased credit risk.  “Now that a takeover is off the table, the buyback and
other potential shareholder enhancement actions increase the
company’s risk profile, despite the fact that its business
outlook is improving,” Levenson said in an e-mail. “I don’t
believe that bond trading levels sufficiently compensate
investors for this risk.”  The offering yesterday consisted of $500 million of 3.25
percent, 7-year notes that yield 122 basis points more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, and $500 million of 5.625
percent, 30-year bonds that pay a spread of 152 basis points, or
1.52 percentage points, Bloomberg data show.  Corporate Spreads  The yield on Potash’s 4.875 percent bonds due in March 2020
ended yesterday at 4.04 percent, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. That’s 123 basis points over similar-maturity
Treasuries. The spread widened to as much as 170 basis points on
Sept. 21, the most since the bond started trading a year
earlier.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of Canada’s corporations rather than its
federal government, was unchanged yesterday at 135 basis points,
or 1.35 percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. Spreads reached 134 basis points Nov. 16, the
narrowest gap since May.  Relative yields on U.S. corporate bonds ended Nov. 19 at
175 basis points, the Merrill data showed. Global corporate
spreads were 165 basis points.  Canadian corporate bonds have lost investors 0.9 percent in
November, poised for the worst month since December 2009. U.S.
company debt has lost 1.1 percent in November. Global corporates
were down 1 percent through Nov. 19.  Budget Deficits  In provincial bond markets, relative yields widened 1 basis
point to 53 basis points. They reached 51 basis points on Nov.
16, the tightest spreads since April, from as wide as 71 basis
points on May 21. Yields narrowed to 3.20 percent from 3.24
percent on Nov. 19.  Provincial bonds have lost investors 1.7 percent this
month, the biggest loss since September 2008. Canada’s
government bonds are down 1.4 percent in November.  Alberta’s deficit will be C$5 billion ($4.9 billion), C$257
million more than budgeted because of lower income tax and non-
renewable resource revenue, according to  financial documents 
posted yesterday on the government’s website.  New Brunswick’s deficit will be more than C$800 million for
the fiscal year ending March 31, greater than the C$749 million
forecast earlier this year, because spending has been higher
than projected, Finance Minister Blaine Higgs said in a
 statement  yesterday on the government’s website.  Retail Sales  Canada’s  consumer prices  advanced at the fastest pace in
two years last month, exceeding all economist forecasts, as
gasoline prices surged. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in
October after a 1.9 percent gain in September, Statistics Canada
said. The core rate, which excludes eight volatile items such as
gasoline, quickened to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent.  Economists forecast inflation would be 2.2 percent and the
core rate 1.5 percent, according to the median of 23 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey. The maximum forecast for overall
inflation was 2.3 percent.  Retail sales increased in September, the fourth straight
gain. Sales advanced 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted C$36.4
billion, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a 0.7 percent increase,
according to the median of 22 estimates.  Government debt rose, pushing the yield on Canada’s
benchmark 10-year bonds down 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.09 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security
due in June 2020 gained 48 cents to C$103.40.  Negative Outlook  Spreads have tightened, even as  Potash ’s “credit outlook
has gotten worse,” Levenson wrote. She said the bonds “would
begin to look interesting” if the spread widened to 150 to 160
basis points over Treasuries.  Standard & Poor’s lowered Potash’s outlook to “negative”
from “stable” on Nov. 18, citing the fertilizer maker’s use of
debt to finance the share repurchase. Potash’s long-term
corporate credit rating of A-, S&P’s seventh-highest, is
unchanged.  The rates could be cut further if Potash “shows no
tangible progress in the next two to three quarters” in
improving financial measures such as the ratio of adjusted debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to about 2, S&P said. After the debt sale, Potash’s
debt-to-ebitda ratio at the end of 2010 will be about 2.5, S&P
said.  ‘Risk Profile’  “The debt-financed share buyback will lead to a weaker-
than-expected financial risk profile, with credit metrics not
likely to come in line with the rating until year-end 2011
assuming market conditions for fertilizers remain positive,”
S&P analyst  Jatinder Mall  said in a Nov. 18 note.  Moody’s Investors Service affirmed its grade of Baa1, one
step lower than S&P’s rating, and said on Nov. 19 that it had a
positive outlook on Potash.  As of Sept. 30, Potash had $2.72 billion in debt due in
more than one year.  Potash shares have risen about 1.4 percent since BHP
withdrew its offer. The stock is still 9.4 percent below its 12-
month high of C$158.17, reached Aug. 23.  Chief Executive Officer  Bill Doyle  “is under pressure to
get the stock price back up,”  Sadiq Adatia , who oversees C$12
billion of assets, including shares of Potash, as Toronto-based
chief investment officer at Russell Investments Canada, said in
a telephone interview. “You only do share repurchases when
you’re confident the shares are undervalued.”  Potash’s credit default swaps have been the third-worst
performing in Canada in the last five trading days. The swaps
rose 4.03 basis points to 106.2 basis points on Nov. 19.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporters for this story:
