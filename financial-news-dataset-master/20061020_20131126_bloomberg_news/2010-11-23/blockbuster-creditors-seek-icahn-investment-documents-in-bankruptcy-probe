Creditors of  Blockbuster Inc. , the
world’s largest movie-rental company, can seek documents in a
probe of events prior to the company’s bankruptcy, including
 those involving Carl Icahn ’s investments.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  in New York approved
creditors request to investigate issues including the October
2009 refinancing of Blockbuster’s senior notes, the negotiation
of the plan support agreement, and any alternative proposals
made to the company, according to court papers.  Creditors lawyer Richard Kanowitz told Lifland that
following a separate request to subpoena documents made by Lyme
Regis Partners LLC, an investor in Blockbuster notes, which
focused on Icahn, the committee would also include “the Icahn
entities as shareholder and lender, but not a director.”  Creditors said in court papers that the liens of senior
noteholders should be investigated since unsecured creditors
will only get a “de minimis” return under a plan support
agreement that sets the terms of reorganization.  The plan is “premised upon a conversion of substantially
all of the Debtors’ prepetition secured debt to equity in
reorganized Blockbuster and provides, at best, a *de minimis*
return to all of the Debtors’ remaining creditors,” lawyers for
a committee of unsecured creditors wrote.  The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
