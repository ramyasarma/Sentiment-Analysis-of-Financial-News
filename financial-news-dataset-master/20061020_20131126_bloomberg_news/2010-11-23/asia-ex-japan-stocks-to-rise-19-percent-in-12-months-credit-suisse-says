The MSCI Asia excluding Japan Index
may rise to 650 in the next 12 months amid a “bottoming” of
leading indicators for the global economy, Credit Suisse Group
AG said in a report.  The forecast represents a gain of about 19 percent from
yesterday’s closing level, similar to the gain seen in 2005,
where there was also a “mid-cycle slowdown,” according to the
report by analysts including Sakthi Siva. The brokerage said
South Korea stocks and energy companies are its “biggest
overweights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
