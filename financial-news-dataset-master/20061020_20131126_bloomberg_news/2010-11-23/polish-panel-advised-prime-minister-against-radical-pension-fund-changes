The government’s Council of Economic
Advisers recommended against “radical” changes in Poland’s
pension system at a meeting yesterday attended by Prime Minister
Donald Tusk, Dariusz Filar, a member of the council, said today
in an interview on Radio PiN.  Filar said a temporary reduction of funds transferred to
privately managed pension funds may be an “option” to help
reduce Poland’s budget deficit, as public finances are now under
“severe pressure.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
