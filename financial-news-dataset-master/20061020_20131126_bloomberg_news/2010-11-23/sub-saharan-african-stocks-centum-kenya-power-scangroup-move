Kenya’s  All-Share Index  dropped for

adding 0.1 percent to close at 1,912.47 by 1:30 p.m. in Port
Louis. Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  declined 0.1 percent
to 839.29 by 12:42 p.m. in Windhoek, a third day of declines.
The  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index  rose for the fourth day
in five, adding 0.2 percent to 7,011.46 by 10:43 a.m. in Accra.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Centum Investment Co. Ltd.  (CENTUM KN), Kenya’s largest
investment company, climbed the most in more than a week, adding
50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 233 shillings.  Profit for the six
months through September increased more than tenfold to 845
million shillings ($10.5 million) on improved performances from
its private equity and real estate operations, Chief Executive
Officer  James Mworia  told reporters in Nairobi today.  Kenya Power & Lighting Co. Ltd.  (KPLL KN), the nation’s
sole electricity distributor, surged 1.75 shillings, or 6.3
percent, to 29.75 shillings, the fourth increase in five days.
The cut-off date for shareholders to be entitled to
participate in a rights offer is Nov. 25.  “There is increased interest because the discount for the
rights is quite substantial at more than 44 percent,” James
Mose, a research analyst at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Financial
Services Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “It is going
ex-rights on Nov. 25 so people are making sure they get on the
register before then”.  Scangroup Ltd.  (SCAN KN), East Africa’s biggest marketing
and advertising company, fell for a seventh trading day,
dropping 6 shillings, or 9.8 percent, to 55 shillings, on
speculation that gains prompted by the company joining Ogilvy &
Mather Group Holdings to form a new unit were overdone.  “The market overacted to the deal with Ogilvy and it is now
doing a correction,” Mose said. The stock has more than doubled
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
