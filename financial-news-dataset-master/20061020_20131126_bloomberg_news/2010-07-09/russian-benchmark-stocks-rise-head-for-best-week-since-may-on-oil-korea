             Russian stocks had their biggest
weekly gain since May as South Korea’s unexpected interest-rate
increase boosted confidence in the global economic recovery.  
 OAO Mosenergo , the Moscow-based power generator, added 1.6
percent. OAO  Gazprom,  the nation’s export gas monopoly advanced
1.4 percent, helping push the Micex Index higher by 0.3 percent
to 1,324.17 at the close in Moscow. The gauge increased 2.8
percent this week, boosted by higher oil prices, an IMF upgrade
of its global economic growth forecast and a report that U.S.
retail sales grew at the fastest pace in four years.  
 The Bank of Korea raised its benchmark interest rate for
the first time since the global crisis, joining counterparts
across Asia in removing monetary stimulus as the region leads
world growth. Crude, Russia’s chief export, rose as much as 81
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $76.25 a barrel in New York.
