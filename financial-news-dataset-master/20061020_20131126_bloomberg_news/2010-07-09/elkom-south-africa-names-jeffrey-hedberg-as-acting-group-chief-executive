             --  Telkom South Africa Ltd. , Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company, named  Jeffrey Hedberg , head of
its Nigerian unit, as acting chief executive officer, replacing
CEO  Reuben September .  
 “These arrangements provide leadership, continuity and
stability,” Pretoria-based Telkom said in a statement today.
Telkom said it will appoint a permanent CEO, the fourth since
its 2003 initial public offering, “in due course.”  
 Hedberg, born in 1961, was CEO of Cell C Ltd., South
Africa’s third-biggest mobile-phone operator, and chairman of
Virgin Mobile South Africa. In July last year Telkom named
Hedberg head of its Nigerian unit, Multi-Links. Since 2007,
Telkom has spent $410 million to buy Multi-Links, which has yet
to deliver a profit.  
 September took the top post in 2007. The company said on
June 4 that he would give up his position when his contract
ended in November. Today it said he stepped down on July 7.  
 Telkom fell 0.3 percent to 37.54 rand as of 12:56 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading. It has risen 0.2 percent this year,
compared with a 6.7 percent drop by rival  MTN Group Ltd.
