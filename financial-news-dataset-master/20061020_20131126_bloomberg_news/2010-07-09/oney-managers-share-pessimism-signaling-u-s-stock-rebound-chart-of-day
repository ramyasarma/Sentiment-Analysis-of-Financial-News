             Pessimism toward U.S. stocks is
almost as prevalent as it was at last year’s lows, according to
two gauges of investor sentiment that suggest the market may be
due for a rebound.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY displays the results of weekly surveys
by the National Association of Active Investment Managers and
the American Association of Individual Investors since the
beginning of 2009. Each appears in a separate panel.  
 This week’s reading for the  manager index  was 13.47, the
lowest since March 2009, when the latest bear market in stocks
ended. Survey responses can range between 200, indicating that
managers are borrowing to profit from stock-market gains, and
minus 200, showing the use of leverage to bet against shares.  
 The top panel tracks the active-manager readings, and the
bottom panel shows the percentage of bulls among respondents to
the survey of individual investors. The latter dropped this week
to 20.9 percent, also the lowest level in 16 months.  
 “This is a positive development” because it signals that
this week’s advance in stocks will last, according to a  posting 
yesterday on the Traders Narrative financial blog. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rose 4.7 percent in the past three days after
dropping 16 percent from April 26 through July 2.  
 Many analysts view investor sentiment as a contrarian
indicator. They see extreme pessimism as bullish, based on the
assumption that optimism will eventually return and demand for
stocks will rise accordingly.
