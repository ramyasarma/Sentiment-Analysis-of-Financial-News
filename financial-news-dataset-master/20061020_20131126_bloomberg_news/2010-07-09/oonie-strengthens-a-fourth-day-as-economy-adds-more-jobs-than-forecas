             Canada’s dollar strengthened against
its U.S. counterpart for a fourth day, rising to the highest
level this month, after a government report showed the country’s
job losses since 2008 have been restored.  
 The loonie advanced over the past five days by the most
in four weeks after the report showed job creation in June was
almost five times what economists forecast, adding to sentiment
the central bank will raise interest rates later this month. The
currency got a boost as stocks and commodity prices rallied this
week on speculation the global economy will weather Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “The flame was kind of dimmed by the apparent slowdown in
economic recovery, U.S growth momentum, but it’s been relit,”
said  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist in Toronto at Bank of
Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit. “Things will be good for
Canada against the U.S. dollar in a non-risk-aversion
environment.”  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, appreciated as
much as 1.2 percent to C$1.0296 per U.S. dollar, the strongest
level since June 23, before trading at C$1.0337 at 5 p.m. in
Toronto, compared with C$1.0420 yesterday. One Canadian dollar
purchases 96.74 U.S. cents. The loonie has appreciated 2.7
percent this week, the most since the five days ended June 11.  
 Employment rose by 93,200 in June, following  gains  of
24,700 in May and April’s record 108,700, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. The jobless rate fell to 7.9 percent, the
lowest since January 2009, from 8.1 percent. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted 20,000 added jobs and an  unemployment
rate  of 8.1 percent, according to the median of 23 estimates.  
 IMF on Canada  
 The job market has been one of the strongest parts of a
Canadian recovery that the International Monetary Fund says will
lead advanced economies this year.  
 Yields on December 2010 bankers’ acceptances, the most-
active contract, jumped 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
points, to 1.34 percent.  
 So-called Bax contracts have settled an  average  of about 20
basis points above the central bank’s overnight target since
1992, Bloomberg data show. Hedge funds and money managers use
the contracts to hedge against interest-rate changes and make
bets. The yield falls as the price rises.  
 Canada’s unexpectedly large job growth in June means that
the country is the first in the Group of Seven to recoup job
losses, returning employment levels last seen in October 2008
when the global slump began.  
 “What we see is an economy that is no longer in need of an
emergency setting for monetary policy,” said  David Tulk , senior
macro strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank in Toronto. “Expect
the Bank of Canada to take rates higher in two weeks.”  
 Bank of Canada  
 The Bank of Canada last month became the first central bank
to raise borrowing costs since the global financial crisis
began, increasing the  target  rate to 0.5 percent from a record
low of 0.25 percent. Policy makers meet again July 20.  
 The  chance  the Bank of Canada will raise its interest rate
to 0.75 percent at its July 20 decision rose to 96 percent today
from 76 percent yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG
calculation derived from overnight index swaps.  
 Canadian bonds have slumped this week on reduced demand for
the safest and most liquid assets. The 10-year security’s yield
climbed 13 basis points, the most this year, to 3.23 percent. It
touched 3.26 percent earlier today, the highest level since June
23. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020
fell today C$1.14 to C$102.22.
