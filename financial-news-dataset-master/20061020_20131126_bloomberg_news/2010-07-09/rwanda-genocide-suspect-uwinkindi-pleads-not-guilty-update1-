             Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi, a former
Rwandan pastor, pleaded not guilty to three charges including
genocide at his first appearance at the  International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda , the United Nations-backed court said.  
 Uwinkindi, 59, also faces charges of conspiracy to commit
genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity, the
Tanzania-based tribunal said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The former Pentecostal priest is accused of turning his
church in Rwanda’s Kayenzi area into a militia hideout and a
place to slaughter Tutsis, the statement said. He also allegedly
led a group of killers to a roadblock outside the church and
ordered them to stop Tutsis from passing, the court said in the
statement.  
 Uwinkindi was arrested in Kampala, the capital of Uganda,
on June 30 and sent on July 2 to the UN detention center in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.  
 As many as 800,000 people, more than a 10th of Rwanda’s
population, died in a 100-day slaughter of minority Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by ethnic-Hutu militias in 1994.  
 The massacre began after the assassination of Rwandan
President  Juvenal Habyarimana , whose plane was shot down as it
prepared to land in the capital, Kigali, on April 6 of that
year.
