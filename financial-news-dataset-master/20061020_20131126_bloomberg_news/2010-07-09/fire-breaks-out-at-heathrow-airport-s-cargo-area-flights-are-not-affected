             About 100 firemen and 20 fire engines
are tackling a “fairly big” blaze at London’s Heathrow
Airport, London Fire Brigade said.  
 Flights are unaffected, a spokeswoman for BAA Airports Ltd.
said in a phone interview today. The blaze, which is in the
cargo area, is away from the main passenger terminals, she said.  
 Workers in surrounding areas have been evacuated, a
spokesman for the fire brigade said by phone. The brigade was
called to the scene at 1.15 p.m.  
 BAA said the airport’s southern perimeter road had been
closed “as a precaution.”
