             The Pensions Regulator of the U.K.
published a “determination” to issue a Financial Support
Direction against 25 companies in the Nortel Networks Corp.
group in Canada, the U.S., Europe and Africa.  
 The regulator’s Determinations Panel found it is
“reasonable to impose the requirements of an FSD” after the
employer of the Nortel Networks UK Pension Plan was found to be
“insufficiently resourced,” it said in a  statement  on its
website.  
 The FSD requires the “target companies” to provide
financial support of as much as 2.1 billion pounds ($3.2
billion) for the shortfall, it said.
