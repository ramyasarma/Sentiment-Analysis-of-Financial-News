             The vuvuzela horns that blare at
World Cup soccer games have been banned in the United Arab
Emirates by religious edict, on the ground that they make an
unholy noise, exceeding 100 decibels,  The National  reported.  
 The sound of the vuvuzela can reach 127 decibels; the
U.A.E.’s General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments
justified the ban by saying fans’ hearing might be damaged, the
newspaper reported.
