             The U.K. government’s plan to align
future increases in pensions to the consumer-price index measure
of inflation rather than the retail-price index may lead to
offerings of CPI-linked bonds, Barclays Plc said.  
 “This clearly hastens the likely introduction of CPI-
linked bonds in the U.K.,” Moyeen Islam, a fixed-income
strategist in London, wrote today in an investor note. “For the
moment there is little alternative to hedge what are now CPI
exposures” than with RPI-linked products, he wrote.
