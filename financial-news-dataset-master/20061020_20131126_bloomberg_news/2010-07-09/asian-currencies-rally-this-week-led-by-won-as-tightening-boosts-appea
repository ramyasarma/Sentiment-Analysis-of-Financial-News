             Asian  currencies gained this week as
signs economic expansion is gathering momentum prompted central
bankers in South Korea and Malaysia to increase borrowing costs,
underpinning fund inflows into the region.  
 The won today climbed to a two-week high after the Bank of
Korea unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time
since August 2008, and said the economy will see “solid
growth” in coming months. The ringgit strengthened for a second
day after Bank Negara Malaysia yesterday lifted its overnight
rate for the third time in 2010.  
 “The knee-jerk reaction has been to buy up the won and we
still like Asian currencies,” said  Thio Chin Loo , a senior
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Singapore. “They’ve
been upgrading growth forecasts and they did hint as well before
this about inflation picking up.”  
 The won appreciated 2.8 percent this week to 1,195.85 per
dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
ringgit strengthened 0.9 percent to 3.1950, Taiwan’s dollar
climbed 0.5 percent to NT$32.125 and the Philippine peso rose
0.8 percent to 46.165.  
 The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, gained 0.5
percent from July 2. The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index  of shares
climbed 4 percent, its best week in seven months.  
 Rate Outlook  
 South Korea’s central bank boosted the  seven-day repurchase
rate  to 2.25 percent from a record-low 2 percent, a move
forecast by four of 14 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News.
The rest predicted borrowing costs would be kept unchanged for a
17th month.  
 The finance ministry on June 24 raised its 2010 economic
 growth forecast  to 5.8 percent, from a December projection of 5
percent, and said the nation needs to “normalize” fiscal and
monetary policies.  
 Asian currencies were also supported this week after the
International Monetary Fund raised its projection for global
growth and U.S. data helped shore up confidence a recovery in
the world’s largest economy will be sustained.  
 The IMF predicted a 4.6 percent expansion, the biggest gain
since 2007. A U.S. report this week suggested retailers’ sales
climbed in the February-June period at the fastest pace in four
years and the government said yesterday that initial jobless
claims decreased by 21,000 to 454,000 in the week ended July 3,
lower than the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 ‘Robust’ Growth  
 Bank Negara Malaysia lifted its overnight rate to 2.75
percent from 2.5 percent yesterday,  saying  recent trends in
industrial production, financing activity, the labor market and
exports showed growth “remained robust in the second quarter.”
The ringgit has gained 7.2 percent this year, Asia’s best
performance.  
 “The increase is justified with a background of strong
economic growth,” said  Akira Banno , a treasury adviser at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “This move will
likely attract more foreign funds and support the ringgit.”  
 The local economy expanded  10.1 percent  in the first
quarter, the fastest pace in a decade. Government reports this
month showed  factory output  and  exports  rose for a sixth month.
The monetary policy stance remains supportive of growth, the
central bank said.  
 The baht gained 0.1 percent this week to 32.38 per dollar
as 10 of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the Bank
of Thailand will raise its policy rate by a quarter point to 1.5
percent at a July 14 review. The Philippine central bank will
decide on interest rates the following day.  
 Elsewhere, Singapore’s dollar gained 1.1 percent this week
to S$1.3789 against its U.S. counterpart. China’s yuan was
little changed from July 2 at 6.7739 and the Indonesian rupiah
edged up 0.2 percent to 9,048.
