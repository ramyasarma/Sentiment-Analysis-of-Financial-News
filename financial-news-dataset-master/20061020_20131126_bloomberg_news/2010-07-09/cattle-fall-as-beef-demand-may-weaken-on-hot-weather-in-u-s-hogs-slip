             Cattle fell for the first time this
week on speculation that demand for beef will decline as hot
weather in the U.S. reduces outdoor grilling. Hogs also
declined.  
 Beef demand usually wanes after U.S. Independence Day on
July 4 because high temperatures keep more people inside, said
 Louise Gartner , owner of Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,
Ohio. The price also may be declining because speculative
investors are liquidating positions after a three-day rally in
which futures gained 1.6 percent.  
 “We’re going to struggle the next couple of months to get
beef moved as we get into the heat of summer,” Gartner said.
“Cattle had a good week. You will see some profit-taking as
well.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.4 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 90.5 cents a pound at 10:47 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 5 percent this year,
partly on rising demand for beef. Feeder-cattle futures for
August settlement dropped 0.2 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.134 a
pound.  
 Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.35 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 80.55 cents a pound in Chicago. The price has gained
0.6 percent this week after slumping 4.6 percent the week
before.
