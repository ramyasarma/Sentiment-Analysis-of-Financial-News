             Emerging-market stocks will rally 20
percent to 25 percent by the end of this year as the world
economy avoids a double-dip recession and attractive valuations
lure investors, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 Most of the rally will come in the fourth quarter as shares
stay in a “trading range” during the historically weak months
of August and September, New York-based strategist  Geoffrey Dennis  wrote in a report dated yesterday. Developing nations
will lead the global economic recovery with growth of 6.8
percent this year and 6 percent in 2011, Dennis wrote.  
 “Fears of a ‘double-dip’ are overdone,” Dennis wrote.
Emerging markets “should remain the strongest part of the
global recovery story,” he wrote.  
 The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has rallied 4 percent this
week, heading for the best one-week gain in four months. The 21-
country index is still down 9.3 percent from this year’s peak,
on concern China’s steps to curb inflation and spending cuts by
governments worldwide will jeopardize economic expansion.
Emerging-market shares trade for 10.8  times estimated earnings ,
a nine percent discount to the long-term average, Dennis wrote.  
 The strategist upgraded his rating of the Europe, Middle
East and Africa region to “neutral” on better earnings momentum
and low stock valuations. He downgraded Latin America to
“underweight” on weaker earnings growth and rising interest
rates. Asia remains “overweight,” the note said.  
 Thailand was upgrade to “overweight” and South Africa,
Poland, Egypt and Malaysia were lifted to “neutral.” Citigroup
downgraded Brazil to “neutral” and India from to
“underweight.”  
 Russia, Turkey, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand are the top
country picks, Dennis wrote. His favorite industries are raw-
material producers, technology and industrial companies.
