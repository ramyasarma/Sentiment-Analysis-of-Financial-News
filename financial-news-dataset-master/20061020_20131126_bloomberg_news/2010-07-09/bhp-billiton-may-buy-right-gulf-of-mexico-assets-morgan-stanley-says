             BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, will consider buying assets in the Gulf
of Mexico, Morgan Stanley said, citing Chief Executive Officer
 Marius Kloppers .  
 BHP can  spend  as much as $20 billion acquiring assets in
the Gulf, including stakes in projects with partner BP Plc that
may become available after the worst oil spill in U.S. history,
Citigroup Inc. said last month. BHP partners BP in the Atlantis,
Mad Dog and Gunflint ventures in the Gulf.  
 “Marius said if the right assets came up at the right
price, BHP would increase its exposure,” in the Gulf, Morgan
Stanley analyst  Craig Campbell  said today in a report. “That
said, he noted during the global financial crisis that companies
with stressed balance sheets managed to hold their tier one
assets and the expects this will remain the case with BHP’s
partner in the Gulf.”  
 Kloppers said he’d been a “little surprised” by the rate
of the slowdown in China, Campbell said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
this month cut its 2010 forecast for China’s growth to 10.1
percent from 11.4 percent as the government tightens property
restrictions to prevent overheating.  
 “Kloppers reiterated the moderately cautious view that he
gave at the result briefing in February this year - the global
economy will take time to work through the sovereign debt issues
and overall demand should be below” levels before the global
financial crisis, Campbell said.
