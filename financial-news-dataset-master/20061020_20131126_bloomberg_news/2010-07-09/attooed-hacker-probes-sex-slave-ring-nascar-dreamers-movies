             Sweden is a country of extreme
darkness and light, depending on the time of year. In “ The Girl
Who Played With Fire ,” it’s very dark.  
 The second movie based on the late Stieg Larsson’s best-
selling trilogy of crime novels is set in a nefarious world of
sex slaves, murder, rape, torture, mental asylums and government
corruption. It’s a place where an abused daughter torches her
father’s face and years later, he seeks revenge by shooting her
and burying her in a shallow grave.  
 After investigating the case of a missing girl in “ The
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ,” bisexual computer hacker Lisbeth
Salander (Noomi Rapace) and magazine publisher Mikael Blomkvist
(Michael Nyqvist) team up to expose a sex-trafficking ring. When
two journalists working on the story are killed and Salander’s
fingerprints are found on the murder weapon, she must also avoid
the police while trying to clear her name.  
 The complex plot involves a sadistic lawyer, fetishistic
sex and a brutish enforcer with a neurological condition that
prevents him from feeling pain. It can get confusing, especially
if you haven’t read the book, but director Daniel Alfredson
provides enough noirish atmosphere and suspense to keep you
interested.  
 The final Swedish-language film in the trilogy, “The Girl
Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest,” will be released in the U.S. in
October. For those who want even more, David Fincher
(“ Zodiac ”) is going to direct a Hollywood version of the “The
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.”  
 “The Girl Who Played With Fire,” from Music Box Films, is
playing in major U.S. cities. Swedish, with English subtitles.
Rating: **1/2  
 ‘Racing Dreams’  
 Josh Hobson, Brandon Warren and Annabeth Barnes are kids
with the same dream -- to become professional stock-car drivers
on the prestigious Nascar circuit.  
 “ Racing Dreams ,” a spirited, candid documentary by Oscar
nominee Marshall Curry (“ Street Fight ”), follows the trio for
a year as they compete in the World Karting Association’s
national series -- the equivalent of Little League for race-car
drivers.  
 Driving karts (they’re no longer called go-karts) that look
like toy versions of open-wheeled race cars, they dash around
oval tracks at more than 70 miles per hour. It’s an expensive
hobby that requires great dedication from the youngsters and
their families, who travel around the U.S. seeking top-flight
competition.  
 The three drivers, who ranged in age from 11 to 13 when the
movie was shot, come from divergent backgrounds and have
contrasting personalities.  
 Hot Temper  
 Josh is a soft-spoken honors student from Michigan who
hones his PR skills by watching interviews of top Nascar
drivers. Brandon, raised by his grandparents in rural North
Carolina while his father is in and out of prison, is a hot-
tempered daredevil who was once disqualified from a race for
reckless driving. Annabeth, a fellow North Carolinian, is a
tall, fun-loving girl who wants to be the first female driver to
win the Daytona 500.  
 Curry’s fly-on-the-wall direction gives us an unfiltered
look into their lives, including painful moments like Brandon’s
reunion with his dad. The kids are so refreshingly open about
their fears and hopes, it’s hard not to root for them.  
 “Racing Dreams,” from Hannover House, is playing in New
York and July 23 in Los Angeles. Rating: ***
