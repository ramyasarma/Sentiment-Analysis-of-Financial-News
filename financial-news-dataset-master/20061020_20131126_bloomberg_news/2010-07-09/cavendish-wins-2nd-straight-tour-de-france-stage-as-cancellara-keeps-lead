             Mark Cavendish of the U.K. won the
longest stage of this year’s Tour de France for his second
straight success. Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara kept the race-
leading yellow jersey.  
 The 141-mile ride over flat terrain between Montargis and
Gueugnon took riders about 5 hours, 37 minutes.
