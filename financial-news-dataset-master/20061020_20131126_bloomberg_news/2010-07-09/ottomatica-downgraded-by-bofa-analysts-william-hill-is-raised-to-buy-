             Italian lottery company  Lottomatica
SpA  was downgraded to “underperform” from “neutral” at BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research, which cited “a continuing
slowdown in the core Italian lottery business and higher tax and
depreciation charges going forward.”  
 The brokerage upgraded  William Hill Plc , the U.K.’s largest
bookmaker by number of outlets, to “buy” from “neutral,” as
it regards “continuing strong trends in online and an
improvement in machines as key catalysts for the stock.”
