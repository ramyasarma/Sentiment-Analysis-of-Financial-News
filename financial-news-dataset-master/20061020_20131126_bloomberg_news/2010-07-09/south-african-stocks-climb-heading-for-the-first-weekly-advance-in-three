             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  climbed 68.39, or 0.3 percent, to 27,129.58 by 10:36
a.m. in Johannesburg. The measure has risen 3.1 percent this
week, heading for its first weekly increase in three.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.

up about 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock index,
rose 3.82 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 280.82 rand.  BHP Billiton
Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining company, advanced 3.50
rand, or 1.7 percent, to 212 rand. Copper climbed in London for
the fifth day in six on speculation that a drop in stockpiles to
a seven-month low indicated rising demand for the metal used in
pipes, tubes and wires.  
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ) gained for the first time in
three days, increasing 8.50 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 339 rand.

earnings for the six months through June may climb to as much as
6.6 billion rand ($872.4 million).  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, rose for a second day, climbing 3.41 rand, or
1.2 percent, to 283.71 rand. Oil headed for its biggest weekly
gain in six in New York as declining U.S. inventories and a drop
in jobless claims bolstered speculation the economic recovery in
the world’s biggest energy consumer is on track.
