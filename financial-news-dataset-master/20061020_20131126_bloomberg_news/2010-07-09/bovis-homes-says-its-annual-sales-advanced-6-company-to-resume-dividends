             Bovis Homes Group Plc , the smallest
publicly traded U.K. homebuilder by volume, reported a 6 percent
increase in sales and said it will resume dividend payments this
year.  
 Sales climbed to 803 homes from 754 a year earlier, the
Longfield, England-based company said today in a statement. The
average selling price was about 163,500 pounds ($248,094).  
 “The group has been operating successfully, delivering
solid weekly private sales rates and achieving sales prices
ahead of the group’s internal expectations,” Bovis said in the
statement. The “strategy of acquiring consented land at this
point in the housing market cycle will add significant value to
the medium term prospects.”  
 U.K. house prices fell the most in four months in June as
more people sought to sell their home, Halifax said yesterday.
Mortgage approvals are at about half the level they were at the
peak of the housing boom in 2007. The Council of Mortgage
Lenders said on June 18 that the market remains “subdued.”  
 Bovis shares have dropped about 17 percent in the past
three months, the second-best performance in the Bloomberg EMEA
Home Builders Index of seven stocks after Berkeley Group. Bovis
has a market value of 465 million pounds.  
 Bovis plans to pay a dividend at the end of the year, based
on potential returns from land sales and its net cash of 79
million pounds.
