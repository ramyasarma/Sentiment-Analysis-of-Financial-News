             Treasury   10-year notes  had the
biggest weekly decline since April as concern eased that the
U.S. is slipping back into recession and the government prepared
to sell $69 billion of notes and bonds.  
 The benchmark 10-year  yield  touched the highest level in
almost two weeks after rising yesterday above 3 percent for the
first time this month as stocks rallied on evidence of a global
economic recovery. Futures traders reversed bets and showed for
the first time in 18 months they expect a decline in the two-
year note.  
 “It’s a combination of supply and the stock market,” said
 Jeff Given , part of a group that manages $18 billion of bonds at
MFC Global Investment LLC in Boston. “All the risky assets have
caught a pretty good bid.”  
 The 10-year note yield increased 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.06 percent, the highest level since June
28, at 4:46 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data.
The price of the 3.5 percent security due in May 2020 fell 7/32,
or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 23/32.  
 The  yield  climbed 8 basis points this week, the most since
the five days ended April 2. It dropped to 2.8793 percent on
July 1, the lowest since April 2009. The  two-year yield  added 1
basis point to 0.63 percent and was little changed for the week.
The 30-year yield rose 3 basis points to 4.04 percent and gained
9 basis points for the week.  
 Net Shorts  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-long position to a net-short position in two-year
note futures in the week ended July 6, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed. Short positions, or bets prices
will fall, outnumbered long positions by 34,266 contracts on the
Chicago Board of Trade. It was the first net-short position
since January 2009.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rallied 5.4 percent this
week, and the MSCI World Index gained 5.3 percent.  
 “We’re on knife’s edge,” said  Christian Cooper , senior
rates trader in New York at Jefferies & Co., one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “There’s a
little bit of optimism, but we could go back to a concern about
a double-dip if we have consistent misses on earnings or a
surprise out of Europe.”  
 Treasuries  slipped as Commerce Department data showed
inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose in May for a fifth month,
increasing 0.5 percent as companies ensured they had enough
goods on hand to keep pace with demand. The Labor Department
said yesterday initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S.
fell more than expected to 454,000 in the week ended July 3.  
 Yields to ‘Climb’  
 Investors should sell 10-year Treasuries, as yields “will
climb back towards 3.25 percent,” strategists at primary dealer
Citigroup Inc. led by  Amitabh Arora  in New York wrote in a note
to clients. The firm recommends buying five-year notes.  
 Ten-year yields will increase to 3.37 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
banks and securities companies, with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weightings.  
 The Treasury will auction $35 billion of three-year notes
on July 12, $21 billion of 10-year debt the following day and
$13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 14. It sold $21 billion of
 10-year notes  on June 9 at a yield of 3.24 percent, compared
with 3.55 percent at the May offering and 3.90 percent at the
April sale.  
 Yield Curve  
 “Given the fact that you have supply in the long end of
the market, you’ve seen the yield curve steepen this week,”
said  Sean Murphy , a trader in New York at Societe Generale.
“The need to rush in, in front of supply, from an investor’s
standpoint isn’t present. It will allow the curve to continue to
steepen. We’ll see higher yields in the short-term.”  
 The gap between 2- and 10-year yields, called the yield
curve, widened by 0.07 percentage point this week, the most
since the week ended March 26, to 2.43 percentage points.  
 The 10-year yield is poised to rise after failing this week
to break through a key technical level, FTN Financial said. It
closed at or above resistance at 2.93 percent,  Jim Vogel , head
of agency-debt research at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a
note to clients. “This type of price action is indicative of a
beginning technical bottom in yields,” he wrote.  
 The next support level is 3.12 percent, Vogel wrote.
Support and resistance are areas on charts where orders may be
clustered. A breach of a level often implies an extension of the
move to the next level.  
 Double-Dip Unlikely  
 The world isn’t likely to experience a double-dip
recession,  Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard University professor and
former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, told
reporters in Singapore today.  
 The IMF on July 7 raised its forecast for worldwide growth
this year to 4.6 percent, the most since 2007, versus an April
projection of 4.2 percent.  
 Traders added the most to inflation bets in six weeks
yesterday. The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices, widened by 8 basis points to 1.81
percentage points in the biggest increase since May 27. The gap
on July 7 touched 1.68 percentage points, a nine-month low. It
increased to 1.85 percentage points today.
