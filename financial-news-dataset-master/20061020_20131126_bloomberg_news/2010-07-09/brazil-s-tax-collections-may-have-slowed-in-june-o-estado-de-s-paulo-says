             Brazil’s tax collections slowed in
June, expanding less than the government forecast, O Estado de
S.Paulo reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  
 Preliminary figures have surprised the government, raising
concern that a sustained slowdown in collections may threaten
this year’s primary surplus target, or the surplus before
interest payments, Estado said. Preliminary figures signal the
economy has slowed, Estado said.
