             South Africa named a newly
discovered Iris plant after the vuvuzela, the plastic trumpet
that became internationally recognized after both delighting and
annoying millions of sports fans watching the soccer World Cup.  
 The plant has funnel-shaped, pale yellow flowers and was
discovered in the wine region near  Cape Town , the South African
National Biodiversity Institute, said in an e-mailed statement.
The plant was named “Moraea Vuvuzela” after the “noisy
trumpet” that “captured the unique spirit” of Africa’s first
Soccer World Cup, said Sanbi, as the institute is known.  
 The monotonous, loud drone from thousands of the straight,
horn-like vuvuzelas, which means “keep on blowing” in Zulu,
drowned out traditional soccer songs from the start of the World
Cup in Johannesburg on June 11.  
 A blast from a vuvuzela can reach 127 decibels, making it
louder than a chainsaw, and prompted some fans to call for the
instrument to be banned. Thousands continued to use the vuvuzela
as organizer FIFA ignored the calls.  
 Blowing into the mouthpiece, the player’s lips open and
close about 235 times a second, sending blasts of air down the
tube, which excite resonance of the air in the cone, according
to  New Scientist . The effect of playing many at the same time is
“like the sound of a swarm of insects,” it said.  
 While the horn is gaining popularity abroad and is being
sold by U.K. supermarket chain  J. Sainsbury Plc , the plant’s own
natural habitat is being transformed for vineyard cultivation,
according to Sanbi.  
 The flower is “critically endangered” in Sanbi’s view, it
said. The  International Union for Conservation of Nature , based
in Gland, Switzerland, is assessing the plant’s status and may
add it to its  Red List  of endangered species, Sanbi said.  
 Sanbi is responsible for assessing the conservation status
of all South African species.
