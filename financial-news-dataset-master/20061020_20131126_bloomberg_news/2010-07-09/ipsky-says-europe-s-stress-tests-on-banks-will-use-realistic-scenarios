             John Lipsky , the second-ranking
official at the International Monetary Fund, said he expects
stress tests of European banks to be based on “realistic
scenarios.”  
 “I’m sure the stress tests that will be chosen, the
scenarios will be realistic ones and will serve the purpose,”
Lipsky said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television in
Frankfurt. “It looks like all the pre-conditions that are
necessary for a productive and constructive step are being
filled.”  
 He said such conditions include broad coverage,
transparency and the availability of “remedial action” for the
institutions that are shown to need additional capital.  
 European stress tests on 91 of the region’s biggest banks
drew criticism from analysts who said regulators are
underestimating probable losses on Greek and Spanish government
bonds.  
 The tests are designed to assess how banks will be able to
absorb losses on loans and government bonds, the  Committee of
European Banking Supervisors  said yesterday. Regulators have
told lenders the tests may assume a loss of about 17 percent on
Greek government debt, 3 percent on Spanish bonds and none on
German debt, said two people briefed on the talks who declined
to be identified because the details are private.  
 Lipsky declined to comment on numbers, saying the tests
should provide a “realistic degree of stress” and give “some
good insight in the underline of the banking system.”
