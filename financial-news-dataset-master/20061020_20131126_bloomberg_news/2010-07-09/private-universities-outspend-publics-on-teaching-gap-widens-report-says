             Private research universities in the
U.S. spent twice as much as their public counterparts to teach
each student in the 2007-2008 school year, widening a cost gap
that can make private colleges unaffordable to students without
financial aid.  
 The private institutions, on average, laid out $19,520 for
each student for instruction that year, a 22 percent increase
from a decade earlier, the  Delta Project on Postsecondary
Education Costs, Productivity & Accountability , a Washington-
based nonprofit research group, said today. Public universities
spent $9,732 for each student, up 10 percent in the decade,
according to the report.  
 The spending rate in 2008 “may turn out to be a high point
in funding for higher education,” the Delta Project said in its
report. The recession that began in December 2007 forced
colleges to cut budgets, beginning in the second half of 2008,
as endowment income fell and states cut subsidies.  
 “I expect we’re going to see revenues are not going to
continue to grow and institutions are going to be having to pay
much more attention to permanent changes in how they spend their
resources,” Jane Wellman, an author of the report and the Delta
Project’s executive director, said in an interview.  
 Falling Revenue  
 Higher education in the U.S. “has seen a permanent
reduction of roughly 10 percent of its revenue base -- more in
some areas of the country, less in others -- money that won’t be
coming back, and can’t realistically be made up in tuition
increases,” the authors wrote.  
 College tuitions in the U.S. have risen faster than
inflation and family incomes, according to the report.  
 “The steadiest source of new revenue in all sectors was
from tuition,” the authors wrote.  
 The Delta Project report doesn’t name any colleges. The
biggest private research universities in the U.S. by enrollment
are New York University and the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles, according to a ranking published last
August by the Chronicle of Higher Education.  
 The largest public research universities in the nation are
Ohio State University in Columbus, the University of Florida in
Gainesville, and the University of Texas at Austin, according to
the Chronicle listing.
