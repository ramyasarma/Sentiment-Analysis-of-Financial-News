             U.S. corn inventories may slide 7.1
percent next year, the government said, as demand grows and
after excess rain prompted farmers to plant less and trimmed
yield potential.  
 Reserves will fall to 1.373 billion bushels (34.6 million
metric tons) by Aug. 31, 2011, from a revised 1.478 billion
projected for this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. The average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was 1.292 billion. In June, the USDA forecast
1.573 billion.  
 “The reduction in the corn carryover has drastically
changed the supply dynamics,”  Roy Huckabay , the executive vice
president of Chicago-based Linn Group, said before the report.
“Too much rain in the Midwest and hot, dry weather in the
southern and eastern U.S. are causing crops to walk backwards.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 7 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.9625 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $3.975, the highest price since Jan. 12.
The most-active contract has jumped 15 percent since June 29,
the day before the USDA said farmers planted less than they
intended this year.  
 Smaller inventories may raise costs for companies including
hog-processor  Smithfield Foods Inc.  and poultry-producer
 Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. , which say corn-based feed is their
biggest expense. Ethanol makers such as  Archer Daniels Midland
Co.  also may have to pay more for raw materials.  
 Planted Acreage  
 The USDA said in June that 87.872 million acres (35.6
million hectares) of corn were planted this year, based on a
survey of farmers. That’s up 1.6 percent from a year earlier. In
March, growers indicated they would plant 88.789 million.  
 U.S. production is projected at 13.245 billion bushels,
down 0.9 percent from 13.37 billion forecast last month. Last
year’s crop was estimated at a record 13.11 billion. Average
yields in 2010 may fall to 163.5 bushels an acre from an
estimated 164.7 bushels last year. That estimate was unchanged
from last month.  
 The amount of corn used to make ethanol in the marketing
year that begins Sept. 1 will increase 4.4 percent to 4.7
billion bushels from the current year, the USDA said. Exports
will be unchanged from this year’s 1.95 billion bushels,
according to the department, which cut its forecast 2.5 percent
from last month.  
 World production in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will
reach 832.4 million metric tons, down from June’s projection of
835.8 million while up 2.9 percent from the current year, the
USDA said.  
 Global consumption is forecast to jump 1.7 percent to
830.89 million from a record 816.83 million in the 12 months
through September.  
 China, the world’s largest corn consumer after the U.S.,
will import 100,000 tons in fiscal 2011, unchanged from last
month’s forecast, the USDA said. This year’s imports are
estimated at 1 million. China will become a  net importer  this
year for the first time since 1996, USDA said.  
 Worldwide inventories will total 141.08 million tons on
Oct. 1, 2011, the lowest since 2008 and down from a revised
147.32 million forecast for the end of this marketing year. In
June, the USDA projected 147.3 million.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at a $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
