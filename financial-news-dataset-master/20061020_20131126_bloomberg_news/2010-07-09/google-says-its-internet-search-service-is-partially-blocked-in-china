             Google Inc.  said its Internet search
service has been partially blocked in China, where the company
is seeking the renewal of its license following a standoff with
the government on online censorship.  
 The search service in China has been partially interrupted
since yesterday, according to the company’s latest  accessibility
report . The last such blockage was on June 20.  
 Google’s “suggest” function has been blocked in China since
June 30, after the operator of the world’s most-popular search
engine filed a revised application to renew its Internet license.
The company expects the Chinese government to approve its
application, Chief Executive Officer  Eric Schmidt  said yesterday.  
 The company stopped redirecting users of its Google.cn
service automatically to an unfiltered Hong Kong site as part of
its  revised application . The Chinese government objected to the
automatic redirection practice, Google said.
