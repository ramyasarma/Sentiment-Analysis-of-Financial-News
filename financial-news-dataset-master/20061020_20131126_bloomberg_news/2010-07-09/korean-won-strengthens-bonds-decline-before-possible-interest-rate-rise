             South Korea’s won strengthened,
headed for a weekly gain, and government bonds fell as some
economists forecast the central bank will today raise its
benchmark  interest rate  from a record-low 2 percent.  
 Four of 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the Bank of Korea will raise borrowing costs by a quarter of a
percentage point today, while the rest forecast no change. The
International Monetary Fund this week raised its 2010 economic
growth forecast for South Korea to 5.75 percent, from 4.5
percent, and called for borrowing costs to climb. The won was
also supported today by U.S. data showing  jobless claims 
declined more than economists forecast last week.  
 “We can’t rule out the possibility they’ll surprise us by
raising rates,” said  Ha Joon Woo , a currency dealer at Daegu
Bank Ltd in Seoul. “The atmosphere from the U.S. overnight will
also add pressure for the won to strengthen to as much as 1,190
against the dollar.”  
 The won rose 0.5 percent to 1,204 as of 9:34 a.m. in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s gained 2 percent
this week. Policy makers may intervene to prevent the currency
appreciating beyond the 1,200 level today, Daegu Bank’s Ha said.  
 The  Kospi  share index was headed for its best close in
almost two weeks as overseas investors  bought  more shares than
they sold for a second day. U.S. Labor Department figures
yesterday showed the number of Americans applying for jobless
benefits last week fell by 21,000 in the week ended July 3 to
454,000. Economists had forecast a decline to 460,000, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  
 Won to Outperform  
 The Bank of Korea has left interest rates unchanged since
February 2009 to spur a recovery from a recession. The  economy 
expanded 8.1 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter,
the fastest pace since 2002.  
 “We have always thought fundamentals were strong, and so
the combination of strong growth and higher interest rates
should help the Korean won outperform further as risk appetite
creeps back,” Brown Brothers Harriman wrote in a research
report today. “Retracement levels to watch for from the June
sell off are 1,206 and 1,197, a break of which would target the
June low in the Korean won of 1,169 per dollar.”  
 The yield on South Korea’s 3.75 percent bond due June 2013
rose four basis points to 3.98 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 “Yields may rise more if the central bank raises borrowing
costs,” said  Peter Park , a fixed-income analyst at Woori
Investment & Securities. “The market fears the central bank
will raise rates more than expected in the second half.”
