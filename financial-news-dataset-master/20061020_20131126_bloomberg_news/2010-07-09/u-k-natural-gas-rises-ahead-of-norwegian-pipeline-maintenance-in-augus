             U.K. natural gas contracts advanced
ahead of planned Norwegian pipeline maintenance in August.  
 Gassco AS, the operator of Norway’s gas pipeline network,
plans to close the Vesterled link to the U.K. next month for
maintenance, according to three people familiar with the work
schedule.  
 The next-month contract rose as much as 0.5 pence, or 1
percent, to 49.7 pence a therm a therm as of 10:35 a.m. in
London, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
equal to $7.55 a million British thermal units. A therm is
100,000 Btus.  
 Vesterled, Norway’s second-biggest pipeline to the British
gas market, will close Aug. 1 for three weeks, said the people,
declining to be identified because the information hasn’t been
made public.  
 Gassco doesn’t comment on future events, Bygnes-based
spokeswoman  Lisbet Kallevik  said by telephone.  
 In March Gassco said it plans to shut the Kaarstoe gas-
processing facility on Norway’s west coast, capable of handling
88 million cubic meters a day, from Aug. 18 through Sept. 7.  
 Demand  for gas in the U.K. is forecast at 216 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m. tomorrow, according to a
National Grid Plc  forecast . That’s about 11 below normal for the
time of year. The nation’s pipelines will hold 333 million cubic
meters of gas at that time, 3 million more than at the start of
today.  
 The within-day contract gained 0.5 pence, or 1 percent, to
50.25 pence a therm. Winter gas, to be delivered in the six
months through March, rose 0.25 pence to 56.6 pence a therm.
