             The U.S. cotton crop will be 9.6
percent bigger than forecast last month, more than analysts
expected, on higher acreage and yields amid favorable growing
conditions, the government said.  
 Production  will be 18.3 million bales, up from 16.7 million
forecast last month and more than last year’s crop of 12.2
million, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
report. Farmers planted 10.9 million acres (4.4 million
hectares), up 19 percent from last year, the agency said,
reiterating the result of a nationwide survey released June 30.
They will also abandon less than last season, the USDA said.  
 “The crop areas are in excellent condition across the
 belt , particularly across our Texas area,”  Carl Anderson , a
cotton economist and professor emeritus at Texas A&M University
in College Station, said before the report.  
 As of July 4, 65 percent of the crop was in good to
condition, compared with 42 percent a year earlier, the USDA
said this week. Crop conditions in the Southwest are the most
favorable in 16 years, the agency said today.  
 The average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a crop of 17.5 million bales. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms. The harvest begins next month in some
parts of the country and is mostly finished in December.  
 The U.S., the world’s largest cotton exporter, may ship
14.3 million bales in the marketing year that begins Aug. 1, up
from the June forecast of 13.5 million, the USDA said. Exports
for the current year are projected at 12.25 million bales,
unchanged from last month.  
 U.S. stockpiles  as of July 31, 2011, will be 3.5 million
bales, up from last month’s estimate of 2.8 million, the USDA
said. Supplies at the end of this July were estimated at 2.9
million bales.  
 World output  will be 116 million bales next year, up from
last month’s forecast of 114.3 million, the USDA said. Global
production is estimated at 102.6 million bales this season.
 Global consumption  may rise to 119.7 million bales next season
from an estimated 116.6 million this year, the USDA said. World
ending stocks will be 49.9 million next year, compared to 51
million in the current season, the agency said.  
 Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.57 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 73.99 cents a pound yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The price has climbed 25 percent in the past year,
partly because adverse weather resulted in a smaller 2009 crop.
