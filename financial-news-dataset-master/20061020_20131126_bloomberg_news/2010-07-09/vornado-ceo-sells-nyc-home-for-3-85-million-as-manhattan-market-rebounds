             Vornado Realty Trust  Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Fascitelli  sold his Upper East Side apartment in
Manhattan for $3.85 million, completing a deal at the asking
price three months after listing the home.  
 The sale of the four-bedroom co-operative on East End
Avenue closed July 7, records on the New York City Department of
Finance website show. It was listed in April for $3.85 million
and on the market for 18 days before going under contract,
according to  StreetEasy.com . The home includes three fireplaces,
a maid’s room and a 192-square-foot (18-square-meter) walk-in
closet, the sales listing by brokerage Corcoran Group said.  
 “You enter the apartment from a large and gracious, semi-
private elevator landing,” the listing by Corcoran’s Marie
Schmon said. “Downstairs you will find a most unique and
private master bedroom suite with a 16 foot by 25 foot
recreation room that will be the envy of everyone you know!”  
 The CEO of the third-biggest U.S. real estate investment
trust sold as the Manhattan property market rebounds from a
plunge in values. The median price for the borough’s luxury
apartments, defined as the top 10 percent of the market, climbed
12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to almost
$4.1 million, according to appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and
broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate . Sales of all co-
ops and condominiums rose 80 percent.  
 1992 Financing  
 City records show Fascitelli took out loans in 1992 for one
of two units at the property that were later combined. He
financed both units in 1998. Sales price information for
transactions before 2003 isn’t public, said Owen Stone, a
spokesman for the Department of Finance.  
 Fascitelli didn’t return a telephone message or e-mail
seeking comment. Schmon also didn’t return a call.  
 Vornado owns office buildings mainly in New York and
Washington, as well as retail properties nationwide. Fascitelli
joined the New York-based company as president in 1996 after
leading  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s real estate practice. He was
promoted to CEO in May 2009, replacing founder Steven Roth, who
remains chairman.  
 Fascitelli has had an annual base salary of $1 million
since 2001, according to a regulatory  filing  in April. His
bonuses for the last three years have been paid primarily in
shares. The fair value of his total compensation for 2009 was
$9.67 million, the company said in the filing.  
 Vornado shares  climbed  83 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday. They rose $1.61, or 2.2 percent, to $75 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading today.
