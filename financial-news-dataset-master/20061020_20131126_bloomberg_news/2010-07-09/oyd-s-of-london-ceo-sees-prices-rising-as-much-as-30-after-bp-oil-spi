             Lloyd’s of London Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Ward  said insurance coverage for offshore oil
rigs in the Gulf of Mexico will rise between 15 percent and 30
percent after BP Plc’s Deepwater Horizon spill.  
 “Prices will have to go up in the Gulf of Mexico,” Ward,
53, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “We’ve seen
very low prices for covering these offshore installations over
many, many years. People recognize that the risks they were
pricing a while ago were underpriced and they need to restore
pricing levels.”  
 Lloyd’s, which insured the Deepwater Horizon rig owned by
 Transocean Ltd. , estimates its insurers will pay out $300
million to $600 million in claims related to the worst
environmental disaster in U.S. history. The U.S. government
estimates the clean-up, mainly paid for by BP, to exceed $20
billion and has signaled tougher regulation for offshore
drilling.  
 Even though BP, which didn’t buy insurance, will cover the
majority of expenses linked to the clean-up, the disaster may
cost insurers as much as $3.5 billion, the biggest man-made
insurance loss since the September 11 terrorist attacks in New
York, according to  Swiss Reinsurance Co.   
 Some Lloyd’s of London insurers, including  Hiscox Ltd.  and
 Beazley Plc , say prices for liability insurance, which pays out
for pollution, litigation and third party claims, have doubled
following April’s oil spill.  
 ‘Cracked the Market’  
 Oil and drilling companies that have had losses in the past
year have had their liability premiums rise by more than 100
percent, said Simon Williams, head of Hiscox’s marine and energy
unit. Other firms have been quoted prices at least 25 percent
higher, he said.  
 “This is the event that’s cracked the market,” Williams
said in a telephone interview. “We’re seeing increases and
we’re keen for that to happen.”  
 Lloyd’s insurers are “concerned” about a proposal by the
U.S. government to raise the cap on liability claims to $10
billion from $75 million under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and
may raise prices accordingly, Ward said.  
 “The liabilities that you now face in the sector assuming
OPA goes through and it’s retrospective, is pretty
significant,” he said. Offshore energy insurance “has been
unprofitable for probably 24 years out of 25 so we need a
significant price adjustment for that area to return to
profitability.”  
 The most expensive property loss for energy insurers was a
July 1988 explosion aboard the Piper Alpha oil platform in the
North Sea, which killed 167 people and cost insurers $3.6
billion in 2009 dollars, according to Swiss Re.
