             Plans by  Kenya Power & Lighting Co. 
to convert government-owned preference shares to ordinary shares
will amount to “re-nationalizing” the company, according to
the  International Finance Corp.   
 “It’s fundamentally moving away from the successes”
Kenya’s government has achieved in selling off state assets, Ram
Mahidhara, principal investment officer in the IFC’s
infrastructure department, said in an interview in Johannesburg
today. The IFC is the World Bank unit for lending to companies.  
 Kenya Power, the country’s monopoly power distributor, said
on Nov. 20 it plans to convert the government’s shares as part
of a reorganization of its capital structure. The Privatization
Commission said on Dec. 1 it plans to sell or lease as many as
26 state-owned companies and assets by 2012 to boost industries
including tourism and agriculture.  
 “What the government has done on privatization is very
good and we’d like to see it continue,” said Mahidhara. The
Kenya power plan is “a little surprising, given that Prime
Minister  Raila Odinga  is from the private sector. It’s going
counter to what we would normally expect.”  
 Ahmed Kassam, special adviser to Odinga, declined to
comment when interviewed in Johannesburg today. Kenya Power
spokesman Kevin Sang also declined to comment.  
 Kenya Power’s  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 2 shillings as of
2:43 p.m. in Nairobi today, giving the company a market value of
15.8 billion shillings ($194 million).
