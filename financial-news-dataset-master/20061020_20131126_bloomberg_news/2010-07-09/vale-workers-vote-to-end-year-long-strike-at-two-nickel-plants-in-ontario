             Vale SA  workers at two Ontario plants
voted to end their year-long strike, the United Steelworkers
union said, closing the longest industrial dispute in the
company’s 67-year history.  
 USW Local 6500 members in Sudbury voted 75 percent in favor
of the new contract, while Local 6200 members in Port Colborne
ratified the deal by a 74 percent margin, the union said
yesterday in an e-mail. The locals approved a five-year
collective agreement.  
 About 3,000 workers represented by the United Steelworkers
at Vale nickel operations in Sudbury and Port Colborne had been
on strike since July 13, 2009. Vale is the world’s fourth-
largest nickel producer and its smelter at Sudbury has operated
at 50 percent capacity since January.  
 Workers accepted hourly wage increases, improved pension
plans and a so-called “nickel bonus”,  Wayne Fraser , the USW’s
district director for Ontario and Atlantic said in the email.  
 Vale’s Canadian operations produce about 150,000 metric
tons of nickel a year, according to Barclays Capital, which
estimates global output this year at about 1.4 million tons.  
 Nickel for delivery in three months was little changed at
$19,446 a metric ton at 2:34 p.m. Sydney time on the London
Metal Exchange. The metal is used to make stainless steel
resistant to corrosion.
