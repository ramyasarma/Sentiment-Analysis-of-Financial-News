             Copper climbed in London for the
fifth time in six days on speculation that a drop in stockpiles
to a seven-month low indicated rising demand for the metal used
in pipes, tubes and wires.  
 Three-month delivery copper gained as much as 1.9 percent
to $6,740 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Stockpiles 
monitored by the LME slid to 439,000 tons yesterday, the lowest
level since Nov. 30. They’re down 13 percent this year, on
course for the first annual decline since 2004.  
 “The decline in inventories reflects tight supplies,
especially in Asia,” said  Hironobu Yamamura , a trader at
Sumitomo Corp.’s commodity business department. Copper may trade
at between $6,500 and $6,800 in the short term, he said.  
 LME copper was at $6,738.25 ton at 3:04 p.m. in Shanghai
after touching $6,745 yesterday, the highest level since June 29.
The price has risen 5.1 percent this week. Copper for September
delivery gained 1.2 percent to $3.0505 a pound on the Comex in
New York.  
 Bookings to remove metal from LME warehouses, so-called
canceled warrants, dropped 7.6 percent to 32,425 tons. Those
have surged more than 12-fold this year.  
 “These two factors have been indicating rising demand for
several months now,”  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt, said in a report yesterday, referring to the
canceled warrants and falling stockpiles. “If general market
sentiment remains positive and the focus of players remains on
this positive microdata, this should support metal prices.”  
 Eight of 15 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Five predicted lower prices and two forecast little change.  
 Equities Gain  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 0.9 percent to 116.17
as of 3:54 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge, which surged 1.6 percent
yesterday after the International Monetary Fund raised its
global economic growth forecast, is set for its biggest weekly
gain since the week ending Dec. 4.  
 “The increase in Asian stocks has also supported copper
and other metals, easing growth concern,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a
senior trader at KEB Futures Co. in Seoul.  
 Central banks in South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and India
have raised rates to combat inflation, judging Europe’s debt
crisis won’t curb expansion after European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the recovery is gaining
momentum and the IMF forecast 4.6 percent global growth this
year, the biggest gain since 2007.  
 Copper for October delivery climbed 1.2 percent to close at
53,640 yuan ($7,919) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Shanghai aluminum was up 0.1 percent at 14,990 yuan and zinc
rose 0.1 percent to 15,360 yuan.  
 ‘Potential Threat’  
 “The global economic recovery is still facing potential
threat from a continuing European debt crisis,” said Yang Jun,
analyst at China Futures Co., in a report. “Also, in the
medium-to-long term, China’s export and manufacturing sector
will undergo adjustment which will have a lingering impact on
refined copper consumption.”  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery in London gained 0.7
percent to $2,002 a ton, zinc rose 0.4 percent to $1,863 and
lead added 0.8 percent to $1,843.25 a ton. Nickel was up 0.1
percent to $19,415 and tin added 1.4 percent to $17,800 a ton.  
 Vale SA workers at two Ontario plants voted to end their
year-long strike, the United Steelworkers union said in an e-
mail. USW Local 6500 members in Sudbury voted 75 percent in
favor of the new contract, while Local 6200 members in Port
Colborne ratified the deal by a 74 percent margin, according to
the union. The locals approved a five-year collective agreement.
