             Soybeans may fall 2 cents to 4 cents
a bushel after the U.S. said global inventories will rise to a
record before the next harvest, said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  
 Global stockpiles on Sept. 30, 2011, before the Northern
Hemisphere harvest, will rise to 67.8 million metric tons from
an estimated 65.35 million tons in the current marketing year,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report. In
June, the government forecast 67 million.  
 Declines in the market will be limited by hot, dry weather
expected to develop in the Midwest later this month, which may
reduce yield potential, Grow said.
