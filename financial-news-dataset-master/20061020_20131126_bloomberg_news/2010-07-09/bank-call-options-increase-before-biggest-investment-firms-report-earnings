             Trading of bullish options on U.S.
banks and brokers rose to a two-month high before three of the
five biggest financial companies report results next week.  
 More than 287,000 calls to buy the  Financial Select Sector
SPDR Fund , an exchange-traded fund tracking 79 firms, changed
hands, triple the four-week average and double the number of
puts to sell. The ETF climbed 1.4 percent to $14.51, its highest
close since June 25. The ETF’s  most-active options  were July $15
calls, which more than doubled to 9 cents and accounted for more
than half of call volume.  
 The biggest transaction involved 95,000 of the July $15
calls at 1:57 p.m. for 8 cents each, Bloomberg data show. The
fund, known by its XLF ticker, hasn’t closed above $15 since May
27. This month’s contracts expire at the end of next week.  
 “It’s a big, bold trade,” said  Joseph Cusick , senior
market analyst at  OptionsXpress Holdings Inc ., a Chicago-based
online brokerage. “Someone’s taking a bullish speculative
position before earnings next week.”  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co . will report results July 15 while Bank
of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. will follow on July 16.
Second-quarter profit at financial firms in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index will increase 81 percent from a year earlier,
according to the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Investors also are creating new bullish positions in
September XLF options, according to options strategists at
Susquehanna International Group LLP in Bala Cynwyd,
Pennsylvania. An investor bought almost 30,000 September $15
calls on the ETF yesterday, and today someone bought 30,000
September $15 calls while selling 30,000 December $16 calls in a
strategy known as a calendar spread, Susquehanna said in a
report.
