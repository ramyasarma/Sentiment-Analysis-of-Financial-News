             Inflation in Germany, Europe’s
largest economy, slowed in June as lower clothing and shoe
prices more than compensated for higher oil costs.  
 The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, fell to 0.8 percent from 1.2 percent in May, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. This matched
the initial estimate of June 28. In the month, consumer prices
remained unchanged.
