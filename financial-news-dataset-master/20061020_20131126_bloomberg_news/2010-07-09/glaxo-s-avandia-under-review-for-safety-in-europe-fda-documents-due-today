             GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s embattled
diabetes drug Avandia is undergoing a safety review by European
regulators, and there will be a similar analysis of the drug
next week by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration .  
 “This is not an automatic review,”  Monika Benstetter , a
spokeswoman for the  European Medicines Agency , said in a
telephone interview. “It happens when there are new safety
concerns,” she said. Normally decisions are made “quite
quickly, though there is not really a timeline now,” she said.  
 Two recent studies linking Avandia to heart attacks and
other cardiovascular complications will be discussed by the
agency’s human drugs committee at its next meeting starting July
19. The body will recommend whether to revoke, suspend or change
the drug’s approval once all the data on its risks and benefits
have been analyzed, the agency said in a statement.  
 “The EU reviewing the dossier is somewhat of a surprise,”
because the agency already reviewed and reauthorized the drug
earlier this year, said  Michael Leacock , an analyst at Royal
Bank of Scotland, in an interview.  
 Glaxo stock  fell  16.5 pence, or 1.4 percent, to 1,125.5
pence at 11:50 a.m. in London trading.  
 Avandia is one of the most widely studied drugs for
treating diabetes, said Jai Patel, Glaxo’s vice president in
metabolic clinical research, in a telephone interview yesterday.
The recently released Record trial included 4,500 patients and
ran for more than five years at the request of European
regulators. It found no increased risk of death from heart
disease or hospitalizations in patients taking Avandia, known
chemically as rosiglitazone.  
 ‘Effective Use’  
 “Our bottom-line message is that for the right patient,
this is an effective use,” Patel said. “It provides benefit
from glucose control and it has not been demonstrated to show
harm. The risk-benefit for rosiglitazone is something Glaxo
stands behind.”  
 A review by the FDA’s staff on recent data gathered about
Avandia is slated to be released today in the U.S. Outside
advisors to the FDA will be asked next week to recommend whether
the agency should recall the drug, which generated $1.1 billion
last year, leave it on the market with additional restrictions,
or make no changes to its marketing approval.  
 “We are cautious ahead of this meeting” in the U.S.,
JPMorgan analysts including  Alexandra Hauber  wrote in a July 7
note to clients. “On a worst-case scenario of worldwide
withdrawal, this equates to a 6 percent downgrade to our 2011
estimated EPS.”  JPMorgan is Glaxo’s house broker.
