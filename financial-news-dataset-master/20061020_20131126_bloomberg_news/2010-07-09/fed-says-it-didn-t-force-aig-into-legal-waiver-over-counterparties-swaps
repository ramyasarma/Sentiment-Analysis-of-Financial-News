             The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
said it didn’t force American International Group Inc. to
include legal waivers benefiting counterparties in derivatives
contracts as a condition of rescuing the insurer.  
 New York Fed general counsel  Thomas Baxter  said today that
he took “issue” with a June 29 New York Times  article  stating
that AIG had to forfeit its ability to sue banks. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA were among counterparties
fully reimbursed for credit-default swaps purchased from AIG.  
 “Regulators did not force AIG into the waiver clause,”
Baxter wrote in a  letter  released today on the regulator’s
website. “The waiver clause was a standard legal provision. It
was a mutual release, by which AIG and the counterparties
released each other from liability.”  
 AIG, once the world’s largest insurer, was rescued in 2008
after counterparties drained the company of cash because assets
protected by the swaps plunged in value. The New York-based
insurer’s bailout package swelled to $182.3 billion.  
 Diane McNulty , a spokeswoman for the New York Times, said
that the “New York Fed was given ample opportunity to comment
on every aspect of the story before publication” and the
newspaper “closely studied everything they presented after
publication, and it does nothing to undermine our confidence in
what we reported.”  
 Baxter’s letter ran in the New York Times.
