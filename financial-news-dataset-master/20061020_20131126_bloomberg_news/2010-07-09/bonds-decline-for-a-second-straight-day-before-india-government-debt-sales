             India’s 10-year bonds completed a
weekly loss after a government debt sale today and on concern
the central bank will increase borrowing costs for the second
time this month.  
 Yields rose to their highest in two weeks as the finance
ministry raised 120 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) from auctions
of fixed-income securities. India sold notes due in 2015, 2020
and 2032 as part of the finance ministry’s record 4.57 trillion
rupee borrowing program for the fiscal year that began in April.  
 “Since there are more debt supplies, there’s little
interest among investors to add to their positions now,” said
 Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in
Mumbai. “Expectations of more interest-rate increases are also
pushing down bond prices.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, this week to 7.65
percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The price fell 0.63, or 63 paise
per 100 rupee face amount, to 101.02.  
 Central bank  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said yesterday it’s
“not advisable” to speak on the economy before the central
bank’s next scheduled policy meeting on July 27.  
 Subbarao last week increased benchmark interest rates after
wholesale price  inflation  accelerated to 10.16 percent in May.
The  reverse-repurchase rate  is now 4 percent and the repurchase
rate 5.5 percent. The Bank of Korea today unexpectedly raised
its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent.  
 India’s economic growth this year may accelerate at the
fastest pace since 2007 as strong domestic demand counters the
impact of the European debt crisis, the International Monetary
Fund said. The economy may expand 9.4 percent in the fiscal year
to March, compared with an April estimate of 8.8 percent gain.  
 Industrial output may rise 16.2 percent in May, the median
of a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists showed before the
data is published on July 12. It grew 17.6 percent in April.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose to their highest since November 2008. The rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, increased 35 basis
points this week to 5.77 percent.
