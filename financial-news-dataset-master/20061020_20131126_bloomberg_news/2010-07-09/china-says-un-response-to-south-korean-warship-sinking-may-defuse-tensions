             China’s ambassador to the United
Nations said the  Security  Council response today to the sinking
of a South Korean warship, which doesn’t explicitly blame North
Korea, will help ease tensions in the region.  
 “I think now the situation is moving in the right
direction,” Ambassador Li Baodong said after joining in
unanimous adoption of a statement that condemns the March 26
attack on the Cheonan.  
 “I can see that the feeling from the Security Council is
to seek peace and stability in the region and encourage that the
parties concerned exercise restraint from escalating the
tensions,” Li said. He said China hopes the UN response “opens
a new chapter” in the region.  
 The  Security Council  statement “takes note” of North
Korea’s denial of involvement in the March 26 incident. North
Korea’s UN Ambassador Sin Son Ho called the statement “a great
diplomatic victory.”  
 A multinational investigation reported on June 14 that a
North Korean-made torpedo caused the sinking. The UN statement
says that, “in view of the findings” of the probe, the
Security Council “expresses its deep concern” about the
finding of North Korean complicity.  
 Envoys from the U.S., Japan and South Korea said that the
message to the government in Pyongyang was clear.  
 Strong Statement  
 “I am sure today’s strong and unanimous statement will
serve to make North Korea refrain from further attacks or
provocations,” South Korea’s Ambassador Park In-kook told
reporters after adoption of the text. “The Security Council
made it clear that it is North Korea to be blamed and to be
condemned.”  
 U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said in a statement
that the Security Council action “sends a clear message that
such irresponsible and provocative behavior is a threat to peace
and security in the region and will not be tolerated.”  
 Clinton, who said she would travel to South Korea this
month for further talks on the situation, praised the “careful
handling” of the incident by the government in Seoul.  
 Susan Rice , the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, said use of the
word “attack” throughout the Security Council statement makes
the message to North Korea “crystal clear.”  
 The statement also says the incident “endangers peace and
security in the region” and urges “appropriate and peaceful
measures to be taken against those responsible for the
incident.”  
 The permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain,
China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- agreed yesterday on the
text following more than a month of negotiations that also
included Japan and South Korea.  
 South Korea initially sought a Security Council resolution
explicitly condemning North Korea for sinking the Cheonan,
demanding an apology and a commitment there will be no repeat of
the attack, and calling for a return to stability in the region.  
 Neutral Language  
 The UN decided “on keeping peace on the Korean peninsula
by using very neutral language rather than taking sides,” said
Kim Yong Hyun, professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. “The
South Korean government may not be happy with the statement,
even though it was expected, because the UN didn’t reflect its
position.”  
 The UN language is a blow to South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak , who has called on China to acknowledge North Korea’s
responsibility and on the UN to take “appropriate action.”  
 Yet by not specifically blaming North Korea, the UN may
help revive six-nation talks on dismantling the communist
regime’s nuclear program, Kim said. North Korea will “continue
the denuclearizaton process on the Korean peninsula through the
six-party talks,” North Korean envoy Sin said today.  
 China’s Foreign Ministry said today the UN statement on the
sinking of the South Korean warship represents an opportunity to
“turn the page” on the incident.  
 Nuclear Talks  
 The six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program should resume as soon as possible, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a press statement today. All
parties should continue to ensure that peace is maintained on
the Korean peninsula, he said.  
 North Korea’s ambassador to the UN said on June 16 that any
Security Council statement “condemning us or questioning us”
would produce a military response. “Follow-up measures will be
carried out by our military forces,” Ambassador Sin told
reporters.  
 The North Korean ambassador, who theorized that the Cheonan
might have run aground on rocks, said his government wants to
send an investigative team to the site of the sinking. South
Korea has rejected such a plan.
