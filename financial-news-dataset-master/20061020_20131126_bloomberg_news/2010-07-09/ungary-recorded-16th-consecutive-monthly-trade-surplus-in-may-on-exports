             Hungary posted its 16th consecutive
monthly  trade surplus  in May as recovering growth in western
Europe after the worst recession since World War II boosted
demand for exports.  
 The surplus was 428.8 million euros ($545 million),
compared with 504.7 million euros in April and 424.2 million
euros in May 2009, the  statistics office  in Budapest said today
in a preliminary report. The median estimate of seven economists
in a Bloomberg survey was 520 million euros.
