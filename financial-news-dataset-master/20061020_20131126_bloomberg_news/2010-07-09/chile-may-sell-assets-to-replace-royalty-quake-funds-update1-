             Chile’s government will consider
selling stakes in companies to help raise money for earthquake
reconstruction after lawmakers yesterday rejected mining royalty
changes, Economy Minister  Juan Andres Fontaine  said.  
 Stakes include the minority shareholdings in companies such
as utility  Aguas Andinas SA  held through government development
agency Corfo, he told reporters today at a conference in
Santiago. Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said last month that
other options to replace the mine tax changes included selling
more debt or tapping more fiscal savings.  
 “We’ve said from the start that one of the funding options
available, besides the royalty and more taxes, is selling the
state’s stakes in various entities, including the minority
stakes Corfo owns,” said Fontaine, who as minister chairs
Corfo’s board. “That’s one option among others.”  
 Chile’s government had planned to raise as much as
$1 billion through changes to the mine royalty system. Larrain
said alternative financing could affect Chile’s exchange rate.
