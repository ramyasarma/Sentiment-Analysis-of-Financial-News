             Gold, heading for a third weekly
decline, may reach a short-term low in the next week and climb
higher, according to technical analysis by independent analyst
 Jim Stellakis .  
 The attached chart shows prices formed a low about every 35
days in the past 10 months, with each new trough being higher
than the last except for at the beginning of February. A failure
to repeat the pattern may push prices down toward gold’s long-
term trend lines between $1,130 an ounce and $1,180, depending
on the speed of the decline, Stellakis said.  
 “This suggests that gold should find a bottom over the
next week,” said Stellakis, founder of New York-based research
company Technical Alpha. “If gold cannot rally by then, lower
prices might be needed to attract buyer interest.”  
 Gold traded at $1,197.35 an ounce at 9:36 a.m. in London
and is down 1.2 percent this week. A third weekly drop would be
the longest run of weekly losses since the beginning of
February. The metal has fallen 5.4 percent since setting a
record $1,265.30 on June 21.  
 The lows typically formed within five days before or after
each expected trough, Stellakis said. The gains between
consecutive lows have mostly returned about 5 percent, he said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
