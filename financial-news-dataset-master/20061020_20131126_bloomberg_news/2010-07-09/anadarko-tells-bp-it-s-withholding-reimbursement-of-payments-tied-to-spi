             Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , the Texas-
based oil company with a stake in the leaking Gulf of Mexico
Macondo well, said it told  BP Plc  it’s not paying for spill
costs because the U.K. company’s actions caused the disaster.  
 Anadarko stands by its June 18 comments about London-based
BP’s role in the incident,  John Christiansen , a company
spokesman, said today in an e-mail. Anadarko, based near
Houston, said that day that BP’s actions related to Macondo
“likely represent gross negligence or willful misconduct.”  
 “Although we have notified BP that we are withholding
reimbursement to BP at this time, we remain committed to working
with BP in good faith to achieve a satisfactory resolution,”
Christiansen said.  
 BP, which owns 65 percent of the leaking well, said in an
e-mailed statement today that  Anadarko  informed the company July
7 it was withholding payment of its share of costs, including
those related to containment efforts. BP said it’s disappointed
Anadarko failed to live up to its obligations under the
operating agreement and Oil Pollution Act.  
 “With respect to our relationship with Anadarko, BP will
continue evaluating options under the operating agreement and
the law,” BP said in a statement.  
 BP said Anadarko’s refusal to pay won’t affect the
commitment to stop the leak, clean it up and pay legitimate
claims as fast as possible.  
 Mitsui’s Share  
 Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. , which is 70 percent-owned by
Japan’s second-biggest trading house, Mitsui & Co., has a 10
percent stake in the well. BP said today that a unit of Mitsui
Oil Exploration has a payment deadline of July 12. To date, BP
said, that unit hasn’t responded to the payment demand.  
 A spokesman for a unit of Mitsui Oil Exploration said he
couldn’t immediately comment.  
 Christiansen declined to say how much money Anadarko, which
has a 25 percent stake in the well, is withholding.  
 BP asked Anadarko to pay about $272 million, according to
documents released by the Senate Subcommittee on Federal
Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services
and International Security. The company also asked a unit of
Mitsui Oil Exploration to pay more than $111 million, according
to the documents.  
 Hearing Planned  
 The subcommittee said today that it plans to hold a July 22
hearing featuring testimony from Anadarko Chief Executive
Officer  Jim Hackett ; Naoki Ishii, president of the MOEX Offshore
2007 LLC unit of Mitsui Oil Exploration; and  Kenneth Feinberg ,
administrator of a Gulf claims fund.  
 The oil spill began after an April 20 explosion on a rig BP
leased from  Transocean Ltd.  to drill the well. BP is capturing
some of the oil and is working on relief wells to stop the flow.
Anadarko’s partnership agreement with BP calls for arbitration
to resolve disputes.  
 Anadarko rose 85 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $45.41 as of
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. BP’s
American depositary receipts rose 31 cents to $34.05.
