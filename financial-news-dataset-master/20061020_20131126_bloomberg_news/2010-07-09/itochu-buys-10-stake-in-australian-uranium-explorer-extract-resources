             Itochu Corp. , a Japanese trading
house, agreed to buy a 10.3 percent stake in Australian uranium
explorer  Extract Resources Ltd.  to benefit from global demand
growth for the fuel.  
 The acquisition, which must be approved by Australia’s
Foreign Investment Review Board, will make Itochu the third-
biggest  shareholder  of Extract Resources after Kalahari Uranium
Ltd. and  Rio Tinto Ltd. , the Japanese trader said in a faxed
statement today.  
 The deal marks Itochu’s second investment in four months in
a uranium company with assets in Namibia after it bought 15
percent of Kalahari Minerals Plc in March. Itochu, which sells
4,000 tons of uranium year, plans to boost its nuclear fuel
business, it said.  
 Extract’s uranium projects in Namibia include the  Rossing 
deposit, which supplies 8 percent of the world’s needs, and the
Langer Heinrich deposit, it said on its website.  
 Kalahari Uranium holds 41.1 percent of Extract and Rio
Tinto has 14.2 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Itochu’s 10
percent stake may be worth 15 billion yen ($169 million), the
Nikkei English News reported earlier today. Itochu spokesman
Yasuhiro Terashita declined to disclose the value.
