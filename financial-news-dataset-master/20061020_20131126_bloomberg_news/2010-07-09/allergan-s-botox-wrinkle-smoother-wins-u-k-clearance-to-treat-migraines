             Allergan Inc.  won regulatory
clearance in the U.K. for its wrinkle-smoothing Botox, an
injectable drug, to be used as a treatment for migraines.  
 The approval is for patients who have headaches at least 15
days a month, including migraines on 8 days, Irvine, California-
based Allergan said today in a statement. Botox is a purified
form of the poison botulinum.  
 The approval was the first for Botox use in migraines, the
company said. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration is
likely to decide this month whether the product can be sold for
migraines,  Aaron Gal , a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst in
New York, said in May. The indication may add $1 billion in
annual sales to Botox, which had  revenue  of $1.3 billion last
year, he said.  
 Allergan rose 91 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $65.49 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
increased 42 percent in the past 12 months.  
 Botox is cleared for U.S. sale for indications including
treatment for eye muscle spasms, and as a tool to eliminate
wrinkles. Allergan also has permission from the U.K.’s Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for those indications.  
 Patients with chronic migraines who took Botox had 7.8
fewer days per month with any headaches, including migraines,
compared with 6.4 fewer headache days on placebo, according to a
company-funded study released last year. In a separate trial,
patients getting Botox injections had 9 fewer days of headaches
per month, compared with 6.7 fewer with a placebo.  
 About 12 percent of people in the U.S. experience
migraines, according to the  National Institutes of Health , in
Bethesda, Maryland. The painful headaches last 4 to 72 hours,
and symptoms include sensitivity to light, noise and odors.
