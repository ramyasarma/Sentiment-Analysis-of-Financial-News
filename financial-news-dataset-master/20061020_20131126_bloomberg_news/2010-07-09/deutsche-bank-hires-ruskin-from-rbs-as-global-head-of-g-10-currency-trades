             Deutsche Bank AG, the world’s biggest
currency trader, hired  Alan Ruskin  from Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc as global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
strategy in New York.  
 Ruskin will report to  Bilal Hafeez , global head of foreign-
exchange research, Deutsche Bank said today in an e-mailed
statement. RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, said
yesterday that Ruskin resigned as global head of foreign-
exchange strategy on July 1. Ruskin worked from Stamford,
Connecticut for RBS.  
 “He will be a major asset as we enhance our research
offering to our U.S. and global client base,” Hafeez said in
the statement.  
 Ruskin joined RBS in January 2006, when it was known as RBS
Greenwich Capital Markets. Prior to that, he was head of
research and managing director of 4Cast.com in the Americas
since 1998. Ruskin was also one of the three founders of
research organization IDEAglobal, according to the press release
from when he joined RBS.  
 In March 2009, Ruskin called U.S. government plans to
purchase bonds “a historic moment -- the start of debasement of
the world’s reserve currency. It feels to many participants that
in the grand sweep of history we are witnessing the end of
‘Rome’ on the Potomac.”  
 David Simmonds , global head of research, will lead RBS’s
currency research on an interim basis at the firm’s securities
unit, the London-based company said an in e-mail obtained by
Bloomberg News yesterday.  Paul Robson  in London and  Greg Gibbs 
in Sydney will continue to provide strategy recommendation to
clients, RBS said.
