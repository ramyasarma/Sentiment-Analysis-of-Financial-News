             Gold may rise above $1,200 an ounce
in New York on speculation the metal’s third consecutive weekly
drop will prompt some investors to increase holdings.  
 European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
indicators suggested economic activity in the region was
strengthening. The dollar was up 0.4 percent against the euro
after earlier trading at an eight-week low and European equities
rose for a fourth day. Gold fell to a six-week low of $1,185 on
July 7 and a third weekly drop would be the worst run since the
beginning of February.  
 “Buyers have taken the opportunity to buy upon dips,”
 Suki Cooper , a Barclays Capital analyst in London, said in a
report. “We do expect continued investor interest in gold to
drive prices higher as the year unfolds.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $4.30, or 0.4
percent, to $1,200.40 an ounce at 8:06 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices fell 0.6 percent this week. Gold for immediate
delivery was 0.2 percent higher for today at $1,200.20.  
 Bullion rose to $1,196.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,193.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Gold futures have lost 5.2 percent since reaching a record
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21, limiting this year’s advance to
9.5 percent. The metal gained this year as investors sought to
protect their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in
Europe and on concern the global recovery may slow.  
 Buying on Dips  
 “Indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic
activity took place during the spring,” Trichet said at a news
conference in Frankfurt yesterday. The ECB’s main interest rate,
which it left unchanged at 1 percent, is at an “appropriate”
level, and inflation expectations “remain firmly anchored,” he
said.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, fell 0.45 metric ton to 1,316.04 tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs were little changed at 2,072.55 tons
yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 Thirteen of 20 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 65 percent, said bullion will climb next week.
Four forecast lower prices and three were neutral.  
 “Investors are likely to continue buying gold on dips
below $1,200 and this may provide some support for gold
prices,” said Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based analyst with Phillip
Futures Pte Ltd. “Our support for gold continues to be pegged
at the $1,185 level and hence downside risks appear to be
capped.”  
 Silver for September delivery in New York increased 0.9
percent to $18.025 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery added
0.7 percent to $1,526.60 an ounce. Palladium for September
delivery gained 1.7 percent to $452 an ounce.
