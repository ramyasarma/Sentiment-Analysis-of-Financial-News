             Enel SpA , Italy’s largest utility,
said it hasn’t reached a decision on selling its 73 percent
stake in Bulgaria’s Maritsa East Three coal-fired power plant.  
 OAO  Inter RAO  UES is prepared to buy the stake for 800
million euros ($1 billion) in a transaction that may be
announced in two weeks, Bulgarian newspaper  Trud  reported today,
citing unidentified officials. Enel denied the report.  
 “The sale process is still ongoing and no agreement with
Inter RAO or any other parties has been reached,” Enel said in
an e-mailed statement today. “Therefore no decision has been
taken by Enel, pending the finalization of the process.”  
 Rome-based Enel is holding a tender selling its Bulgarian
assets.  AES Corp. , the U.S. power producer with operations in
more than two dozen countries, is interested in acquiring the
stake,  Peter Lithgow , the managing director of AES’s Bulgarian
unit, said in May.  Inter RAO , Russia’s state-run electricity
trader, is also in talks to buy the stake.  
 Enel a year ago completed a 700 million-euro expansion of
the  Maritsa East Three  lignite-fired power plant that raised its
capacity to 908 megawatts, extended its operational life by 15
years and installed anti-pollution equipment to meet European
Union environmental safety requirements.  
 Arlington, Virginia-based AES is building a 1.3 billion-
euro power plant called Maritsa East One, which is in the
Maritsa East mining and power generation complex, in
southeastern Bulgaria.
