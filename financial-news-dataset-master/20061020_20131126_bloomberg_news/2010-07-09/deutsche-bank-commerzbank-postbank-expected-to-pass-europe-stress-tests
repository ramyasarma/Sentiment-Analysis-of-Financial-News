             Deutsche Bank AG ,  Commerzbank AG  and
 Deutsche Postbank AG , Germany’s biggest publicly traded banks,
will probably pass European stress tests based on preliminary
findings, four people briefed on the process said.  
 The banks are expected to exceed the threshold of a 6
percent Tier 1 ratio under the stress scenario, which assumes an
economic slowdown and sovereign-debt losses, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the information isn’t
official. The lenders are due to submit test results to
regulators early next week, they said.  
 European Union regulators are carrying out stress tests on
91 lenders across the region, including 14 in Germany, that are
aimed at reassuring investors that banks have enough capital to
withstand a debt default by a European country. Assessments
carried out in the U.S. last year found 10 lenders needed to
raise $74.6 billion of capital.  
 “In principle, the stress tests are good news for the
banking sector, but there’s been some criticism that the
scenarios are too weak,” said  Matthias Engelmayer , a Frankfurt-
based analyst at Independent Research GmbH. “German political
support for the stress tests signaled that the banks would be
successful.”  
 Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, rose 0.5 percent to
49.25 euros in Frankfurt trading. Commerzbank, the second-
largest, dropped 0.1 percent to 6.29 euros, while Postbank lost
2.6 percent to 23.80 euros.  
 Earlier Tests  
 Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank in Frankfurt,
as well as Postbank in Bonn, declined to comment.  
 Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank had already passed a first
round of stress tests organized by the  Committee of European
Banking Supervisors , people briefed on the results said in June.
Those tests examined fewer lenders and didn’t take into account
sovereign risks, according to the people. The new round of tests
by CEBS examines possible losses on sovereign bonds, including a
so-called haircut of about 17 percent on Greek debt, people
familiar with the matter said this week.  
 Deutsche Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of
financial strength, totaled 11.2 percent at the end of March.
Commerzbank’s ratio was 10.8 percent and that of Postbank was
7.3 percent, including market risk.  
 Government Bailout  
 Commerzbank got an 18.2 billion-euro ($23 billion)
government bailout during the financial crisis, including a
capital injection of more than 16 billion euros. Deutsche Bank
and Postbank didn’t require state aid. Deutsche Bank owns almost
30 percent of Postbank with an option to take control of the
retail lender.  
 EU stress tests assume a 3 percentage-point deviation from
the European Commission’s economic forecasts over two years and
a deterioration of sovereign debt risk as compared to market
prices in early May, according to CEBS. The Commission estimates
the EU’s economy will grow by 1 percent this year.
