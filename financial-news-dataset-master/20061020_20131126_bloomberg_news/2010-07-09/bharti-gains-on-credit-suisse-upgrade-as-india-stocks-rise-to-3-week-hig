             India’s stocks advanced, driving the
benchmark index to a three-week high, as  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  and
other telecom companies surged after they were upgraded by
Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 Bharti, India’s largest mobile-phone operator, and  Idea
Cellular Ltd.  jumped the most in 13 months after Credit Suisse
raised their ratings to “outperform,” citing stable tariffs
and reduced prospects of further price wars.  Reliance
Communications Ltd.  added 3 percent. Equities gained for a
second day after the International Monetary Fund said India’s
growth this year may accelerate at the fastest pace since 2007.  
 “I have always been bullish on the Bharti stock and have
been accumulating it,” said  Manish Sonthalia , who manages $230
million in equities at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Tariffs are no longer falling and the new players haven’t made
a dent. And the IMF projection is a sentiment booster.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 181.81, or 1 percent, to 17,833.54, the highest close
since June 21. The gauge gained 2.1 percent this week, the most
in three weeks. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange rose 1.1 percent to 5,352.45. The  BSE 200 Index 
increased 0.9 percent to 2,268.77.  
 Global and Asian emerging-market stock funds took in net
inflows as investors bought more shares in Taiwan and India in
the week ended July 7 even as they pulled $11.25 billion from
equity funds worldwide, EPFR Global said. Indian inflows rose to
an 11-week high,  EPFR  said in an e-mailed statement.  
 May 2009  
 Bharti jumped 9.9 percent to 308.65 rupees. Idea surged 13
percent to 66.7 rupees. Both stocks gained the most since May
18, 2009, when the Sensex surged 17 percent on optimism
triggered by the Congress party’s biggest election victory in
two decades. Reliance Communications increased 3 percent to
193.4 rupees. Bharti’s shares have the potential to reach 350
rupees in a year, Motilal’s Sonthalia said.  
 Prior to today’s rally, Bharti shares had declined 29
percent over 12 months and Reliance Communications lost 26
percent, the Sensex’s worst performers, on concern that the
price war among mobile phone companies will slash earnings. Idea
dropped 15 percent, while the Sensex climbed 28 percent.  
 India’s telecom stocks were upgraded at Credit Suisse by
analysts led by  Bhuvnesh Singh , saying tariffs have been stable
over the past eight months and the cost of acquiring high-speed
third-generation bandwidth will crimp the ability of
“challengers to go for another price war.” Reliance
Communications had its rating increased to “neutral.”  
 Nothing Pessimistic  
 “There is nothing to be so pessimistic about them, they
are likely to benefit as the economy grows,” said  Kishor Ostwal , managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a
publicly traded equities research provider in Mumbai. “The
general buoyant mood after yesterday’s IMF forecast is
continuing today.”  
 Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services provider, which gets almost 99 percent of its revenue
from abroad, climbed 1.6 percent to 2,873.8 rupees, a record, as
investors became more confident in the global economic recovery.
 Wipro Ltd. , the third-biggest software services provider,
increased 1.5 percent to 401.2 rupees.  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and
zinc producer, rose 1.6 percent to 167.7 rupees. Three-month
delivery copper gained as much as 1.1 percent on the London
Metal Exchange.  
 Tata Steel, Hindalco  
 Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the alloy,
advanced 2.3 percent to 495.95 rupees.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. ,
the biggest aluminum producer, added 2.9 percent to 149 rupees.  
 DLF Ltd. , India’s biggest developer, gained 4.6 percent to
295.8 rupees, while  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. , a builder of
dams, roads and bridges climbed 1.5 percent to 125.3 rupees.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  352 million rupees  ($7.5
million) of Indian equities on July 7, bringing total
investments in stocks this year to 315.8 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
