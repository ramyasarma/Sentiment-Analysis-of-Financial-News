             A gradual strengthening of the yuan
would be good for China as it would help curb large inflows of
investment money drawn by expectations for currency
appreciation, Yu Yongding, a former advisor to the People’s Bank
of China, wrote in a commentary published in today’s China
Securities Journal.  
 China should reduce its capital account surplus to help
balance the nation’s current account surplus, thereby reducing
pressure for yuan appreciation and slowing the growth of China’s
foreign exchange reserves, Yu wrote.  
 Excess liquidity should be absorbed to ensure economic
stability and to avoid “serious” inflation and asset bubbles,
Yu wrote.
