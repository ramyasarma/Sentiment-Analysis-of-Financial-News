             Kenya plans to reopen its 25-year
bond this month and aims to raise as much as 15 billion
shillings ($184 million), said Jackson Kitili, the Central Bank
of Kenya’s head of monetary operations and debt management.  
 The East African nation may issue 31.6 billion shillings of
infrastructure bonds in August, the only infrastructure bond
sale planned in the fiscal year ending June 2011, Kitili said by
phone from Nairobi, the capital.  
 The interest rate and maturity date of the infrastructure
bond hasn’t been decided, he said.
