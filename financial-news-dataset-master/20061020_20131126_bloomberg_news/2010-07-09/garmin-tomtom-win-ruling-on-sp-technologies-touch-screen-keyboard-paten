             Garmin Ltd.  and  TomTom NV , makers of
mobile mapping and satellite-guided navigation systems, have won
a lawsuit accusing them of infringing a patent for touch-screen
keyboard technology.  
 U.S. District Judge  Rebecca R. Pallmeyer  in Chicago ruled
yesterday that SP Technologies LLC couldn’t enforce the patent
it filed in 2000 because the technology was used in some 1996
Acura RL automobiles built by Honda Motor Co.  
 SP Technologies of St. Petersburg, Florida, sued Garmin in
2008. Amsterdam-based TomTom was added as a defendant in a
revised complaint.  
 Garmin , the biggest maker of mobile navigation systems in
the U.S., maintains a  boutique  on Chicago’s North Michigan
Avenue, a shopping district known as the “Magnificent Mile.”
TomTom is Europe’s largest maker of the devices.  
 The lawsuit, brought by Chicago patent attorney Ray Niro,
had sought a court order barring further infringement and money
damages. Niro didn’t respond to phone messages seeking comment
on today’s ruling.  
 Garmin  is based on the island of Grand Cayman in the Cayman
Islands. Its media relations department didn’t immediately reply
to an e-mailed request for comment.  
 Lea Armstrong, a U.S. spokeswoman for TomTom, didn’t
immediately return voice-mail and e-mail requests for comment.  
 The case is SP Technologies LLC v. Garmin International
Inc., 08-cv-03248, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago).
