             Corn futures may open 2 cents to 3
cents a bushel lower after a government report forecast a
smaller drop in U.S. inventories than analysts expected, said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  
 Stockpiles will fall to 1.373 billion bushels (34.6 million
metric tons) by Aug. 31, 2011, from a revised 1.478 billion
projected for this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. The average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was 1.292 billion. In June, the USDA forecast
1.573 billion.  
 Declines will be limited by forecasts for hot, dry weather
developing in the last half of July, Grow said.
