             Wheat prices may fall after a
government report showed U.S. supplies will rise on better-than-
expected production, said  Jason Britt , the president of Central
States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri.  
 U.S. stockpiles will total 1.093 billion bushels (29.75
million metric tons) next May 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a  report  today. That’s up 12 percent from
973 million bushels a year earlier. Production will total 2.216
billion bushels, the same as a year earlier and more than the
average forecast of 2.164 billion in a Bloomberg News survey of
16 analysts.
