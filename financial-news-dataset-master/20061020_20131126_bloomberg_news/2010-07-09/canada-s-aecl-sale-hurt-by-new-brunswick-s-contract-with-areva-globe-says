             The Canadian government may be
hampered in trying to sell Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. because
of a decision by the New Brunswick government to work with a
competitor, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 New Brunswick dropped a proposal by Atomic Energy to build
a new nuclear reactor because the Canadian crown corporation had
failed to make progress on a plan to build the reactor and sell
the power to New England, the newspaper said.  
 Instead, the province signed a letter of intent yesterday
with Areva SA of France to build a so-called “energy park.”  
 The Canadian government is trying to sell Atomic Energy,
and the bidding process closed on June 30, the Globe reported.
Interested bidders may include SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. of
Montreal and Westinghouse Electric Co. LLC, the paper said.
