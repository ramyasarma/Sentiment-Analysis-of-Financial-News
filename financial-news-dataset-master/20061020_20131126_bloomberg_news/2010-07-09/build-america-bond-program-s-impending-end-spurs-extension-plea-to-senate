             U.S. state, city and county groups
urged the Senate to extend the Build America Bond program, the
part of the federal economic-stimulus plan that has driven down
borrowing costs for public-works projects across the country.  
 The move to push back this year’s scheduled expiration by
two years faltered in the Senate last month. Republicans balked
at the cost of the bill that included the measure, as well as
extra Medicaid funding and unemployment benefits. Six groups,
including those representing mayors, governors and state
treasurers, urged Senators to prolong the bond-subsidy program.  
 “Failure to take prompt action on a BABs extension may
have immediate, unintended, and negative consequences for the
market for BABs, both in the U.S. and overseas,” the groups
said today in a letter to Senators  Max Baucus  and Senator
 Charles Grassley . Baucus, a Montana Democrat, is chairman of the
Finance Committee, and Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is the
ranking minority-party member of the panel.  
 “BABs have proven their worth as a stimulus for state- and
local-government economic activity,” the groups said. “We
believe it would be most unfortunate if the program were not
extended because of considerations” unrelated to the issue.  
 The Build America Bond program was created in the wake of
the  credit crisis  to help drive down borrowing costs for
governments seeking to finance public-works projects. About $118
billion of the taxable securities have been sold since April
2009. That has also reduced the supply of traditional tax-exempt
municipal debt, fueling demand for those issues.  
 The Treasury pays 35 percent of the interest costs on Build
Americas, a direct subsidy instead of the tax advantages
typically provided by municipal bonds.
