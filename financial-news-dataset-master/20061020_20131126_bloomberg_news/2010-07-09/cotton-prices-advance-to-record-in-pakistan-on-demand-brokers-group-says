             Cotton prices in Pakistan, where the
crop and related industry accounts for about a quarter of the
economy, have surged to a record as local demand exceeds supply,
according to the Cotton Brokers’ Association.  
 The spot price on the Karachi Cotton Exchange rose to 7,500
rupees ($87.57) per 40 kilograms yesterday, with demand of
10,000 bales a day outstripping supply of as much as 6,000 bales,
Chairman Naseem Usman said by phone today. A year ago, the price
was 3,200 rupees per 40 kilograms, or maund.  
 Pakistan, the third-largest cotton producer and the largest
cotton-yarn exporter, has targeted a crop for 2010-11 of 14.4
million bales. Pakistan’s cotton exports may decline in the year
from August, according to a forecast from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. A bale weighs 37.3 kilograms.  
 “Prices are rising because the crop is late to arrive
because of the water shortage,” Lal Chand, a grower, said from
Nawabshah, about 209 kilometers (130 miles) north of Karachi.
“Prices will recede to 6,000 rupees per 40 kilograms by mid-
August,” Chand said by phone.  
 Pakistan’s cotton exports will decline to 500,000 bales in
the year from Aug. 1 compared with an estimated 730,000 bales
the previous year, according to a USDA report posted on
the agency’s website on July 1.  
 “Mills are buying the stock for their future orders,”
said Usman from the Cotton Brokers’ Association. “The local
price translates into $1.10 per pound internationally, which is
higher than the 75 cents for futures and $1 for” immediate-
delivery cotton, Usman said.
