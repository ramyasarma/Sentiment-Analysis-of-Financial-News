             Honeywell International Inc.  won a
contract valued at more than $3 billion to supply brakes and
other parts for China’s first narrow-body passenger jet, the
company’s second award for the aircraft program.  
  Commercial Aircraft Corp.  of  China Ltd.  chose Honeywell to
provide wheels and brakes, the brake control system and tires
for the new C919 airliner. The deal’s value is over the life of
the program, which includes replacement parts,  Karen Crabtree , a
spokeswoman for Honeywell’s Phoenix, Arizona-based aerospace
division, said today by phone.  
 Honeywell, which describes China as the “third pillar” of
the global aviation market, is competing for two more contracts
for the C919, Crabtree said. The company, based in Morris
Township, New Jersey, made its first C919 deal in April, a $7.3
billion agreement to supply power units. The airliner is
scheduled to enter service in 2016.  
 The aircraft parts maker operates 10 plants throughout
China, including aerospace maintenance and manufacturing
facilities in Xiamen, Nanjing, Suzhou and Shanghai, according to
a statement today.  
 The company’s  shares  gained 30 cents to $41.02 at 1:11 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They had climbed
3.9 percent this year before today.
