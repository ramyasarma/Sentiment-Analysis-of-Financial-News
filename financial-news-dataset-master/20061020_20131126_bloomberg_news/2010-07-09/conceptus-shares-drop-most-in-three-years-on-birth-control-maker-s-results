             Conceptus Inc. , maker of a form of
permanent birth control, fell the most in 10 years after the
company said second-quarter results fell short of forecasts.  
 Conceptus  declined $3.12, or 20 percent, to $12.67 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, the
stock’s biggest drop since April 2000. The shares had lost 3.7
percent of their value in the past 12 months before today.  
 Sales  were $36.8 million to $36.9 million, less than the
company forecast of at least $39.5 million, as visits to
doctor’s offices for the birth-control procedure declined, the
Mountain View, California-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Conceptus had a loss of 1 cents to 2 cents a share,
less than its guidance for at least break-even. The company also
lowered its full-year forecasts.  
 “2010 has developed into a challenging year for us, with
the weak domestic economy and strong U.S. dollar impacting our
results more than we had anticipated,” said Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Sieczkarek  in the statement.  
 Full second-quarter results are scheduled to be released
Aug. 5, the company said.  
 Conceptus’s Essure, a minimally invasive device that
prevents women from getting pregnant, generated sales of $131
million last year. Women must see a physician to receive the
product.  
 Office visits are expected to decline 5 percent to 10
percent this year from a year earlier, Conceptus said. Foreign
currency exchange may reduce sales by $4 million and earnings by
9 cents a share, the company said.  
 The company said net sales for 2010 are  expected  to be $143
million to $145 million compared with a previous range of $160
million to $165 million. The company expects earnings per share,
excluding certain items, to be 70 cents to 75 cents compared
with previously expected range of 99 cents to $1.04 for 2010.  
 Lazard Capital Markets and Maxim Group cut their ratings on
Conceptus to “hold” from “buy” today.
