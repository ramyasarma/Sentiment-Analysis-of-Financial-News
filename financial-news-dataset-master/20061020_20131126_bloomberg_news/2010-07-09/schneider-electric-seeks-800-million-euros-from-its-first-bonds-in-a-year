             Schneider Electric SA  is raising 800
million euros ($1 billion) from its first bond sale in more than
a year to refinance existing debt.  
 The world’s largest maker of low-voltage equipment is
selling 300 million euros of six-year bonds, and 500 million
euros of 10-year notes, according to a banker involved in the
sale who declined to be identified before the sale is completed.
Paris-based Schneider is also tendering for as much as 300
million euros of its 6.75 percent bonds due 2013.  
 Schneider priced the six-year notes at a yield of 73 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, less than a quarter of
the spread it paid last year on its 2013 bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to
hold investment-grade bonds instead of government debt narrowed
3 basis points this week to 200, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “Schneider’s timing is great after a week of spread
tightening,” said  Charles Stephens , a debt capital markets
specialist at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP in London. “Every
time the company taps the market, it benefits from strong
domestic investor demand, but it has also built up an
international following.”  
 A Schneider spokesman declined to comment.  
 Tender Offer  
 The 10-year notes will have a spread of 88 basis points,
the banker said. The issue is being managed by Bank of America
Corp., Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG and Societe
Generale SA with Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International Plc and
Natixis.  
 The six-year deal is being handled by Deutsche Bank, HSBC
Bank Plc, SocGen with BNP Paribas SA, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Banco Santander SA.  
 Schneider last sold bonds in January 2009 when it raised
750 million euros from the 2013 notes priced to yield 360 basis
points over swaps, Bloomberg data show. Bondholders are being
offered 114.05 cents on the euro for the 2013 securities in the
tender that expires July 16, the banker said. That compares with
112.51 at 2:49 p.m. in London, HSBC prices on Bloomberg show.  
 Schneider  is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors, the fourth-
lowest investment grade, and an equivalent A- at Standard &
Poor’s.
