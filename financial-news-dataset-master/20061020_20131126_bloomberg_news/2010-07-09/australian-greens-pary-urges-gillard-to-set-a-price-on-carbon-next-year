             The Australian Greens have urged
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  to set a price on carbon in 2011
before introducing an emissions-trading system.  
 The price should be introduced at A$23 ($20) a ton and rise
4 percent plus inflation each year ahead of an emissions trading
scheme starting, the party said in a June 28 letter to Gillard.
Greens leader  Bob Brown  said the party opposes emissions targets
being set before trading starts, according to the letter.  
 “Within three months of the Gillard government being re-
elected, the Greens would be willing to legislate for a carbon
price which could open the way later to emissions trading,” the
party says in the letter. It also wants a ban on coal-fired
power stations and an end to logging of native forests.  
 Gillard, who became the nation’s first female prime
minister after ousting  Kevin Rudd  last month, today said she
aimed to get “lasting community consensus” on a carbon price.
Gillard said she will maintain a plan to set up an emissions
trading system after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.  
 Gillard’s Australian Labor Party doesn’t control the upper
house Senate, which rejected Rudd’s climate bill twice last year
and again in February. The government needs support from either
the Greens Party and two independent senators or from the
opposition coalition to pass legislation.
