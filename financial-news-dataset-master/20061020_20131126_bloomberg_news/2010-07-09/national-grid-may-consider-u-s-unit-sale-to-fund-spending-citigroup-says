             National Grid Plc , the owner of
Britain’s natural-gas and power networks, may consider selling
its U.S. business to maintain capital spending without having to
sell shares again, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 Its U.S. units have an estimated enterprise value of 12
billion pounds ($18 billion), Citigroup analysts  Peter Atherton 
and Stephen Hunt wrote in a note to investors yesterday. They
cut their rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  
 “National Grid can expect much greater scrutiny of its
U.S. business from shareholders, where performance has been
increasingly disappointing,” they said. The “rationale for
continued ownership has been significantly undermined by events
and therefore a strategic review is likely.”  
 The network owner is committed to spending 4.4 billion
pounds a year to modernize the U.K.’s transmission system and
connect new power stations and offshore wind farms. This
compares with annual capital expenditure of about 2 billion
pounds in 2006. This level of spending could increase if Britain
remains committed to a target of getting 15 percent of its
energy from renewable sources by 2020, Atherton said.  
 National Grid issued 990.44 shares in May to raise 3.2
billion pounds to fund its five-year investment program. The
share sale was necessary to ensure the company could pay a
dividend to shareholders and avoid a ratings downgrade, the
analysts said.  
 No-one from National Grid could immediately be reached for
comment.
