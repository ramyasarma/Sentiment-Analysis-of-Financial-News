             Emirates National Oil Co., Dubai’s
government-owned refiner, stopped bunker refuelling operations
to ships in the port of Fujairah,  Al-Ittihad  reported, citing
Khalid Hadi, group brand and marketing manager at ENOC.  
 The company stopped bunkering operations since the
beginning of July for “economic reasons,” the newspaper quoted
Hadi as saying.
