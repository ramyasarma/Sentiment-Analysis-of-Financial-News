             Banca Generali SpA  Chief Executive
Officer Giorgio Girelli expects the asset manager to post higher
first-half profit compared with last year, according to an
interview published by  MF  today.  
 The firm attracted 1.25 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in
funds from investors in the six months through June, he told the
financial daily. That compares with about 500 million euros for
the whole of 2009, excluding a further 1.6 billion euros that
the manager raised through a one-off tax amnesty, he was cited
as saying.
