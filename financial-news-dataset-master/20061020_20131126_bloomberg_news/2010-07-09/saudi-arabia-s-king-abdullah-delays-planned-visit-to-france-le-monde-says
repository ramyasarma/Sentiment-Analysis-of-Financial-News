             Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah has
postponed a planned trip to France that was to have started on
July 12, Le Monde reported, citing an unidentified person.  
 No reason has been given for the postponement, the
newspaper said. Abdullah, who was born in 1924, was to have
opened a Saudi exhibition at the Louvre museum in Paris and
still intends to come before the exhibition closes on Sept. 27,
the newspaper said.  
 The postponement won’t affect contract negotiations between
France and Saudi Arabia, according to Le Monde.
