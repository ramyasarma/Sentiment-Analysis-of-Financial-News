             Germany’s upper house of parliament
backed reductions in solar-power subsidies of as much as 16
percent after offering the industry an extra three months to
adjust to the cuts.  
 The measure trims so-called feed-in tariffs for solar
power fed into Germany’s electricity grid by 16 percent for
rooftop equipment, 15 percent for farmland and 11 percent for
spaces such as former industrial or military sites, effective
July 1.  
 Shares of manufacturers in Germany, the world’s biggest
market for photovoltaic panels, have suffered this year amid
uncertainty about how much the tariffs would be reduced. The
Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar Index, with 38 members including
Q-Cells, First Solar Inc. and Solarworld, has declined 23
percent this year.  
 After some German state governments objected, the planned
eductions were scaled back by three percentage points for each
category until Sept. 30, when the full cuts kick in.
