             The koruna gained to its strongest in
almost two months against the euro, poised for its best week in
seven months, as confidence in the global recovery rose and
Czech industrial production accelerated the most in nine years.  
 The currency strengthened as much as 0.6 percent and traded
up 0.4 percent at 25.330 per euro as of 5:10 p.m. in Prague, its
highest intraday level since May 13. It took this week’s advance
to 1.5 percent, the biggest since the five days ended Dec. 4.
The Polish zloty increased 0.3 percent to 4.0699 per euro and
Hungary’s forint added 0.3 percent to 279.52 per euro.  
 Global stocks advanced this week after South Korea joined
Malaysia, Taiwan and India in raising interest rates, a vote of
confidence in the global recovery. Czech industrial output
climbed an annual 16.9 percent in May, the statistics office
said, a day after the International Monetary Fund raised its
estimate for global growth and European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the recovery is gaining momentum.  
 “The koruna is benefiting from an overall optimism in the
region,” analyst  Jan Vejmelek  at Komercni Banka AS, the Prague-
based unit of Societe Generale SA, wrote in a report today.
“Strong economic indicators have also supported the
appreciation of the Czech currency.”  
 Three Czech political parties that emerged as winners of
the May 29 general election reached an agreement on a common
political program and will sign the government coalition
agreement on July 12, Prime Minister Petr Necas said today.
