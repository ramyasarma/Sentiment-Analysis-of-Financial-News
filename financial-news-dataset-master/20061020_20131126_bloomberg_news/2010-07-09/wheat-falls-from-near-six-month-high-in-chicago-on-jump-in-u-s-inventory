             Wheat futures for September delivery
fell 12.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $5.36 a bushel at 9:42 a.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade, after yesterday reaching $5.495,
the highest price since Jan. 12. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture today forecast a bigger-than-expected jump in
domestic inventories of the grain.
