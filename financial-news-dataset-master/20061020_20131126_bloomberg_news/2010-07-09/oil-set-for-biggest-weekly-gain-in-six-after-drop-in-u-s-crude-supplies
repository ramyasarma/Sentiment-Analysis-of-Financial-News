             Crude oil advanced in New York,
heading for its biggest weekly gain since May, as equities rose
in Asia and Europe, bolstering optimism that fuel demand may
increase.  
 Oil climbed after a U.S. government report yesterday showed
 stockpiles  dropped 4.96 million barrels last week, the most
since September. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  advanced for a
fourth day today.  
 “The U.S. inventory data is positive,” said  Amrita Sen ,
oil analyst at Barclays Capital in London. “The U.S. is growing
strongly once again.”  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as 51 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $75.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
It was at $75.72 at 12:01 p.m. London time. Yesterday, the
contract gained $1.37, or 1.9 percent, to $75.44, the highest
settlement this month. Oil is set for a 5 percent increase this
week, the most since the five days ended May 28.  
 Brent crude for August rose as much as 49 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $75.20 a barrel and was at $75.17 at 12:01 p.m. on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. Yesterday, the
contract gained $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to $74.71, also the
highest settlement this month.  
 Barclays Capital expects crude oil prices to average $84 a
barrel in New York this quarter, bolstered partly by forecasts
of record demand this year, Sen said.  
 Demand Recovery  
 Worldwide oil use will rise by 1.7 million barrels a day,
or 2 percent, in 2010 to a record 86.4 million barrels, the
Paris-based International Energy Agency said on June 10.  
 “The recovery in oil demand has come a lot more quickly
than previous expectations,” Sen said.  
 The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest expansion since 2007, the International Monetary Fund
said yesterday in revisions to its World Economic Outlook.  
 “Oil is moving extremely closely with equity markets,”
Maziar Amiri, an energy trader at E&T Energie
Handelsgesellschaft mbH, said from Vienna. “The fall in
inventories was also positive for the market.”  
 U.S. crude supplies fell to 358.2 million barrels in the
week ended July 2, the lowest in 10 weeks, according to the U.S.
Energy Department report. Imports slipped and refiners increased
 operating rates  to 89.8 percent of capacity, the highest weekly
average since January 2008.  
 Oil may rise next week after the IMF upgraded its global
economic outlook and as U.S. supplies dropped to a two-month
low, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty of 38 analysts and traders, or 53 percent, forecast
crude will increase through July 16. Ten respondents, or 26
percent, predicted futures will be little changed and eight saw
a decrease. Last week 53 percent of survey respondents forecast
a price decline.
