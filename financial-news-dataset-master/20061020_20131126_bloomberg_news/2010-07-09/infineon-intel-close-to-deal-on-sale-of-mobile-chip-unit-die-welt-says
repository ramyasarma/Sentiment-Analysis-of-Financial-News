             Infineon Technologies AG is close to
selling its mobile-chip unit to Intel Corp. for as much as $1.4
billion, Die Welt reported, citing unidentified bankers.  
 The two sides have met several times in the past few weeks,
though a contract has not yet been signed, the German newspaper
said. The companies declined to comment, Die Welt said.
