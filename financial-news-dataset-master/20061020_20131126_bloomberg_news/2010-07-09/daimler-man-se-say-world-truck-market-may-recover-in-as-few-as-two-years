             Daimler AG  and  MAN SE , Europe’s
biggest and third-biggest truckmakers, said worldwide sales of
heavy vehicles may match figures from before the recession by as
early as 2012 as growth is pushed by emerging markets.  
 European manufacturers can speed up their recovery by
establishing ties with competitors in countries with growing
economies,  Andreas Renschler , head of the Daimler Trucks
division, said today at a conference in Frankfurt.  
 Brazil’s industrywide truck sales are at a record high and
China’s “didn’t collapse at all” during the global financial
crisis, MAN Chief Executive Officer  Georg Pachta-Reyhofen  said
at the conference. “By 2012 or 2013, we’ll be back at pre-
crisis levels, although not at the record sales” of 2008.  
 First-half exports by Germany’s commercial-vehicle makers
jumped by 57 percent from a year earlier, while full-year
domestic sales of trucks weighing more than 6 tons may rise
5 percent,  Matthias Wissmann , president of the German automakers
association, or VDA, said at the conference. That compares with
a 28 percent drop in German sales of trucks and buses in 2009.  
 MAN’s shares have  risen  33 percent this year, while Swedish
truckmakers Volvo AB and Scania AG are the best performers on
the eight-stock  Bloomberg Europe Autos Index .
