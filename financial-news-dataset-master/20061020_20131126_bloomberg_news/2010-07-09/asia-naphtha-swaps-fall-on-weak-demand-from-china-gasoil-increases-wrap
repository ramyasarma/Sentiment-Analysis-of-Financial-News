             Naphtha swaps in Asia declined as
demand for chemicals in China remained weak, while gasoil and
fuel oil gained after crude rose for a third day on increased
optimism over a U.S. economic recovery.  
 August swap contacts for  naphtha  fell $1.70 to $67.50 a
barrel at 10:08 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
broker PVM Oil Associates. Naphtha, the only oil product to
decline today, is poised for its third week of losses.  Gasoil 
climbed 65 cents to $85.55 a barrel and  fuel oil  swaps rose $6
to $445 a metric ton.  
 Crude oil rose in New York, poised for the biggest weekly
gain in six, as declining U.S. crude inventories and a drop in
jobless claims bolstered speculation the world’s biggest energy
consumer would sustain a recovery.  
 Refining losses from making  fuel oil  dropped 92 cents to a
discount of $4.29 a barrel against Dubai crude, while  gasoil
processing profits  climbed 65 cents to $12.80 a barrel, PVM data
showed.  Naphtha’s discount  to the Middle Eastern oil grade
widened $1.70 cents to $5.25 a barrel.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the second
half of August were bid at $634 a ton against offers at $637 at
8:29 a.m., according to data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  
 Naphtha  for delivery in September closed at $630.50 a ton
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
