             INSAT-4B, an Indian communications
satellite launched in 2007 by Arianespace, suffered a power
glitch on July 7 forcing a shutdown of half of its transponder
capacity, the national space agency said today.  
 A team of scientists is studying how to restore services
through “partial utilization” of some of the satellite’s 24
transponders, the  Indian Space Research Organization  said in an
e-mailed statement in Bangalore.  
 A transponder is a communications component that receives a
signal and resends it at a different frequency, allowing near-
instantaneous transmission between distant points on the earth’s
surface. Transponders are used for television broadcasting.  
 INSAT-4B will mainly be used by state-run television
broadcaster  Doordarshan  and  Sun Direct TV Pvt.  for direct-to-
home services, the space agency’s marketing unit’s executive
director, Sridhar Murthy said in 2007.  
 “Doordarshan’s services are going on as normal,” Chief
Engineer R.K. Jain said in a phone interview from New Delhi
today. “The transponders on which we have our services are
working okay. Only a few, which were used for DTH operations,
got affected and we have other capacity.”  
 Billionaire  Kalanithi Maran , whose family owns 80 percent
of Sun Direct, was not immediately reachable on his office phone.
Malaysia’s Astro Group owns the remaining stake in Sun Direct.  
 India launched its first space rocket in 1963 and its first
satellite in 1975. The country’s satellite program has launched
21 orbiters, of which 11 are currently in service.
