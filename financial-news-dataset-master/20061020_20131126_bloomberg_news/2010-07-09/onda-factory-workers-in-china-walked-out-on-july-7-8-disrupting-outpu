             Honda Motor Co.  workers at an
assembly plant in Guangzhou, China, walked out on July 7 and
July 8, causing the Japanese carmaker’s production in China to
be disrupted for at least the fourth time since May.  
 Some of the approximately 1,000 employees at Honda’s joint-
venture factory in the city stopped work because they were
dissatisfied with working conditions, said  Yoshiyuki Kuroda , a
Tokyo-based spokesman for the carmaker. They returned after
reaching an agreement with management, and the plant is now
operating normally, he said, declining to disclose details of
the agreement.  
 At least nine strikes at Japanese carmakers and their
suppliers since the middle of May have disrupted the companies’
output in China and forced them to raise wages. Automakers say
rising labor costs won’t deter them from increasing capacity as
 demand for cars  rises in the world’s largest auto market.  
 Honda  fell  0.3 percent to 2,607 yen as of 10:04 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
dropped 0.2 percent.  
 The factory in Guangzhou makes models including the Jazz
compact car and has capacity of 50,000 vehicles a year.
