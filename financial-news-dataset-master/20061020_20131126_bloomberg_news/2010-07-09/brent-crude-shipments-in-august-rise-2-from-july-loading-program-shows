             Daily shipments of North Sea Brent
crude, part of the price benchmark for almost two-thirds of the
world’s oil, will increase by 2 percent in August.  
 Tankers are set to load 157,968 barrels a day of Brent
crude next month compared with 154,839 barrels scheduled for
July, according to a trader with knowledge of the loading
schedule, who declined to be identified as the information
hasn’t been made public.  
 A total of 4.897 million barrels will be shipped in August,
compared with 4.8 million barrels this month.  
 Brent is one of the four North Sea oil grades used to
price crude from the Middle East, Africa and Russia. The other
types are Forties, operated by BP Plc, StatoilHydro ASA’s
Oseberg blend and ConocoPhillips’s Ekofisk.
