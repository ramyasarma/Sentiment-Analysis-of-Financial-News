             U.S. airlines flying  Boeing Co.  757,
767 and 777 aircraft must inspect or replace the cockpit windows
after 11 reports of fires tied to electrical wiring in the past
two decades, the Federal Aviation Administration said today.  
 The order is aimed at eliminating loose connections that
heat the window and prevent ice from forming, the FAA said in an
e-mailed statement. Loose connections in the electrical system
may lead to cracked windows, smoke or fire, the agency said.  
 The order covers 1,212 U.S. aircraft, and inspections will
cost carriers a total of $103,000, according to the FAA.
Operators can begin inspections within 500 flight hours of the
July 13 effective date, or install a redesigned window, the
agency said.  
 The most recent incident was an emergency landing by a UAL
Corp. United Airlines 757 at Washington Dulles International
Airport on May 16, the FAA said. While no reports have been
received about fires on Boeing 747s, the FAA said it plans a
directive for those planes later this year because the windows
are similar.
