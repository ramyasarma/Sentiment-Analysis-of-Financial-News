             The failures of 10 rupiah sukuk
auctions this year are prompting Indonesia’s finance ministry to
revive demand for its Islamic debt by tapping international
investors and possibly changing its sales practices.  
 The world’s most-populous Muslim nation raised 4.9 trillion
rupiah ($540 million) from notes that comply with Islam’s ban on
interest in 2010, down 40 percent from a year earlier, according
to the finance ministry’s Debt Management Office. The next
auction on July 13 is seeking 1 trillion rupiah. Malaysia, the
biggest market, has generated 15 billion ringgit ($4.7 billion)
from five sukuk sales, government data show.  
 Indonesia may negotiate rates with potential investors in
so-called book-building rather than in a single auction,  Dahlan Siamat , director for Islamic financing at the ministry, said
yesterday in a phone interview from Jakarta. Domestic investors
are demanding higher returns from Islamic bonds because they
aren’t actively traded, according to PT Bank Danamon Indonesia
and PT Bank Syariah Mandiri in Jakarta.  
 “We may use a different approach of a book-building
process if we can’t sell Islamic notes in the next auction,”
Siamat said. “The auctions failed because investors asked for
higher yields above our benchmark because the market isn’t
liquid.”  
 Indonesia sold its first domestic sukuk in August 2008
through book-building. State-owned PT Danareksa Sekuritas, PT
Mandiri Sekuritas and PT Trimegah Sekuritas arranged the sale,
which raised 2.7 trillion rupiah, according to the finance
ministry’s  website . The government had 38 trillion rupiah of
sukuk outstanding as of June 29, 2010, the ministry data shows.  
 Islamic Assets  
 Indonesia’s dollar-denominated sukuk due 2014 handed
investors a 4.9 percent return so far in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield, which was as high as 8.63
percent when the bonds were first sold in April 2009, fell 79
basis points this year to 3.81 percent.  
 Shariah-compliant bonds returned 6.6 percent this year,
according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index , while
debt in developing markets gained 6.5 percent, JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s  EMBI Global Diversified Index  shows. Global sales of sukuk
fell 23 percent to $6.58 billion in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Indonesia’s Islamic banking assets totaled $8 billion at
the end of last year, 2.9 percent of its total, Mulya siregar, a
director of Islamic banking at the central bank, said yesterday.
By contrast, Malaysia’s $93 billion of Shariah-compliant assets
account for 19.6 percent of the industry, according to Bank
Negara Malaysia’s website.  
 Market Development  
 “Until the market is fully developed, investors will
continue to demand a very high liquidity premium,”  Helmi Arman ,
a strategist at PT Bank Danamon, the nation’s sixth-largest
lender by assets, said in an interview yesterday in Jakarta.
“There won’t be much improvement in the auction as the
outstanding sukuk aren’t liquid enough.”  
 The government plans to sell five-, seven-, and 10-year
Islamic bonds on July 13, according to the finance ministry’s
 website . Indonesia failed to sell any sukuk at three auctions
this year. The remaining seven sales all fell short of target.  
 The government raised 474 billion rupiah at its last
auction on June 15, less than the 1 trillion rupiah sought
because yield bids were too high. It received offers amounting
to 1.76 trillion rupiah. The yield on the seven-year sukuk
dropped 20 basis points from the previous sale to 8.65 percent.  
 International Market  
 The yield on the sukuk maturing in January 2017 rose one
basis point to 8.07 yesterday, according to prices from
Indonesia’s Interdealer Market Association. The yield on the
seven-year non-Islamic government bond is lower at 7.9 percent
and fell seven basis points yesterday.  
 “Last year, the government offered yields of 11 percent at
one point, so investors want to bid at 11 percent,” said Tutuy
Guntara, an investment manager at PT Bank Syariah Mandiri in
Jakarta. “The government wants about eight percent.”  
 The industry’s assets may almost triple to $2.8 trillion by
2015, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based Islamic Financial
Services Board. Transactions are based on the exchange of asset
flows rather than interest to comply with the religion’s Shariah
principles.  
 “We haven’t seen much interest from foreign investors in
our regular sukuk auctions,” according to Siamat. “It’s very
possible” that a book building will raise their participation,
he said.  
 ‘Growth Story’  
 Indonesia is turning to global investors this year to
finance its budget deficit, which the government estimates will
increase to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 from
1.6 percent.  
 The government is planning to sell as much as $650 million
of Islamic bonds overseas in October, Siamat said on July 7. The
nation sold its first international sukuk last year.  
 “We are going to look at Indonesia’s global and domestic
sukuk offerings,”  Rafael Martinez Dalmau , director of Islamic
investments at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, the asset
management unit of BNP Paribas SA, France’s biggest bank, said
in a July 7 interview in Singapore. “Indonesia is a growth
story and its economics are very solid. We favor the Indonesian
market as a whole.”
