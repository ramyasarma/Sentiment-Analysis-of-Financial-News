             China, the world’s largest rare-
earths producer, cut export quotas for the minerals needed to
make hybrid cars and televisions by 72 percent for the second
half, raising the possibility of a trade dispute with the U.S.  
 Shipments will be capped at 7,976 metric tons, down from
28,417 tons for the same period a year ago, according to  data 
from the Ministry of Commerce yesterday.  
 Rising production of hybrid cars and music players such as
Toyota Motor Corp.’s Prius and Apple Inc.’s iPod have driven up
demand for rare earths even as China cut the quotas to shore up
prices and ensure domestic supplies. The U.S. is looking at
building a trade case on the restrictions, industry
representatives said last month.  
 “The rare earths industry officials have realized that,
after many years of continued growth in exports, the industry
didn’t receive due profit returns,” Liu Aisheng, director of
the Chinese Society of Rare Earth, said in an interview by phone
from Beijing. “They adjusted the policy to ensure that the
resources are optimally utilized.”  
 Shares of  Lynas Corp. , building a rare earth mine in
Australia, rose 8.8 percent to close at 59.5 Australian cents in
Sydney.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. , the
biggest Chinese producer, rose 1.4 percent to close at 36.69
yuan on the Shanghai stock exchange.  
 Baotou Steel, Baotou Huamei RE Products Co. Ltd. and
Sinosteel Corp. are among the 32 local and foreign companies
that are permitted by the government to export in the second
half, according to the Ministry of Commerce statement.  
 Lynas Opportunity  
 “The tightening of supply regulations provides additional
opportunities for Lynas to meet the supply deficit out of
China,” Executive Chairman  Nicholas Curtis  said today in a
statement filed to the Australian Stock Exchange. Sydney-based
Lynas is building a rare earth mine at Mount Weld in Australia.  
 The total Chinese export quota for 2010 is 30,258 tons, 40
percent less than the 50,145 tons for 2009, Lynas said in the
statement.  
 Rare earths are a group of chemically similar metallic
elements, including lanthanum, cerium, neodymium and europium.
They are used in radar, high-powered magnets, mini hard-drives
in laptop computers, catalytic converters for vehicles,
electric-car batteries and wind turbines. China, which accounts
for more than 90 percent of the global production, started
cutting output and exports in 2006 as prices fell.  
 “Reduced supply from China will trigger other rare earth
producers to boost production to fill the gap,” said Liu of the
Chinese rare earth society. Still, the policy will force some
privately owned Chinese producers to shut down as they are not
authorized exporters, he added.  
 Trade Tensions  
 The U.S. has asked business groups and unions to provide
evidence that China is hoarding rare earths for a case that may
be filed at the World Trade Organization, according to industry
representatives who asked not to be identified.  
 A rare-earth mine in the U.S., in Mountain Pass, California,
shut down most operations in 2002.  Molycorp Inc. , which owns the
mine, plans to reopen it this year.  
 China needs to restrict exports and production because
domestic supplies won’t be enough to meet its own needs, the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in
September.  
 Below is a table of Chinese rare earth export quotas for 2009
and 2010. The numbers are in metric tons.

                          July 9 (Bloomberg) -- London Metal Exchange Chief Executive Officer Martin Abbott talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about demand for commodities in Asia and the LME's growth strategy in the region.
     The London-based exchange, founded in 1877, has entered talks with Singapore Exchange Ltd. on possible cooperation in Asia, according to a statement yesterday. The LME opened its first overseas office in the Southeast Asian city-state this year. Abbott, speaking from Singapore, also discusses regulation for commodity trading.
