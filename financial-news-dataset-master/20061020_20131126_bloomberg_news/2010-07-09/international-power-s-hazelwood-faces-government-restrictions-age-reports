             International Power Plc may have to
shut a quarter of capacity at its Hazelwood power plant in
Australia within four years under government plans to cut
emissions, the Age newspaper reported citing unidentified
sources. The company may receive “hundreds of millions of
dollars” in compensation for shutting part of the coal-powered
plant, the newspaper said.
