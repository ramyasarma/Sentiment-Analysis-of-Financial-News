             Coffee exports from producing nations
will decline for a second year in 2010 amid “scarcity” that
has prompted a rally in New York futures, the International
Coffee Organization said.  
 Exports will drop below last year’s estimated 95.5 million
bags and slide from 2008’s 97.7 million bags,  ICO  Executive
Director  Nestor Osorio  said in an interview yesterday. He didn’t
specify the amount or percentage decline expected this year.  
 “There is less coffee available,” Osorio said by
telephone from London. “That’s also reflected in the price.”  
 Coffee prices have increased 19 percent this year in New
York amid a shortfall that has prompted investment funds to bet
on gains, he said.  
 Production in Colombia, the second-largest producer of
mild-tasting arabica beans, dropped to a 33-year low in 2009.
Colombia may produce less than 9 million bags in the year that
began Oct. 1, Osorio said.  
 In the first six months of the year, the crop unexpectedly
slid to 4.04 million bags from 4.24 million bags a year earlier,
 Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers  said yesterday.
In February, the group forecast output for the period of at
least 4.9 million bags. Each bag weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds).  
 In Brazil, the world’s largest producer of the bean, the
quality of coffee was hurt by too much rainfall last year even
as production increases, Osorio said. Brazil’s harvest, now
under way, will rise to about 50 million bags from an estimated
39.5 million bags in the prior season, according to ICO figures.  
 Coffee demand in industrialized countries may be slowing
compared with last year, Osorio said. In 2009, consumption
worldwide rose by 2 million bags to an estimated 132 million
bags, according to the ICO.
