             South Korea’s won extended today’s
advance after the central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark
interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point from a record-
low 2 percent.  
 The currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 1,200.55 per
dollar as of 10:31 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched this month’s high of 1,199.70 after the
rate decision, which was forecast by four of 14 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The other projections were for no change.
