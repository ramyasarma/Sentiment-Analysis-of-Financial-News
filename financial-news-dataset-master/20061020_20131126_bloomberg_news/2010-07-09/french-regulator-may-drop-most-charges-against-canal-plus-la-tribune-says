             France’s competition regulator may
drop most of the accusations against Canal Plus following a
recommendation by head regulator Virginie Beaumeunier, La
Tribune reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The authority is likely to accept Beaumenunier’s
recommendation not to challenge agreements made when Canal Plus
bought rival pay-TV company TPS in 2006, the newspaper said.
This would greatly reduce Canal Plus’s potential liability to
fines, according to the newspaper.  
 Canal Plus is still being investigated and could be fined
over claims it has not respected engagements made at the time of
the purchase, La Tribune said.
