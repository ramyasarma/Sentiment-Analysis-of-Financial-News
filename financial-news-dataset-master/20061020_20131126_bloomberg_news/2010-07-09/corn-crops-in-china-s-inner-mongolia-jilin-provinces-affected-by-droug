             Corn crops in China’s Inner Mongolia
and Jilin province have been affected by drought, the National
Grain & Oil Trade Center said today on its website. Over 70
percent of Inner Mongolia is experiencing drought and
authorities there are preparing to seed clouds to enduce
rainfall, it said.  
 The statement did not detail the extent to which the corn
crops have been affected.
