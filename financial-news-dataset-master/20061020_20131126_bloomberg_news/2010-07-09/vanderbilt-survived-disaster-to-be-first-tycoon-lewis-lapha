             It was Friday, Nov. 8, 1833, and the
New Jersey train from Amboy to Bordentown was jammed. VIPs
onboard included former U.S. President John Quincy Adams. A fire
broke out and a carriage derailed, leading to the first recorded
train accident involving the death of passengers.  
 Describing the bleeding, mangled and moaning injured lying
along the road, Adams called it “the most dreadful catastrophe
that ever my eyes beheld.”  
 Also on the train was 39-year-old Cornelius Vanderbilt,
whose body was shattered, crushed ribs piercing his lung. Even
in pain, blood filling his mouth, Vanderbilt kept his head and
his commanding style. Not waiting for help, he arranged his own
rescue, ordering that he be moved to a nearby cottage and that
doctors be sent for.  
 He later said if he had died then, “the world would not
have known that I had lived.” He went on to carve out a great
transportation empire and shape the U.S. business landscape. By
the end of Vanderbilt’s life in 1877, his assets represented one
out of every twenty dollars in circulation.  
 T.J. Stiles ’s biography, “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life
of Cornelius Vanderbilt” (Vintage), which won the Pulitzer
Prize and National Book Award, was recently published in
 paperback . I spoke with the author on the following topics:  
 1. Revolutionary Capitalist  
 2. Competition vs. Monopoly  
 3. Business Betrayal  
 4. Steamships to Railroads  
 5. Founding a Dynasty
