             The euro dropped from an eight-week
high against the dollar after touching a level where sell orders
were clustered that was defined by its plunge since December.  
 Canada’s dollar advanced to its strongest level this month
as job creation in June was almost five times what economists
forecast. South Korea’s won rose after the central bank
unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time since the
onset of the global financial crisis.  
 “We’ve seen a lot of profit taking given that the euro
approached some key technical levels today,” said  Douglas Borthwick , head of trading in Stamford, Connecticut, at Faros
Trading LLC, which executes currency transactions on behalf of
hedge funds and institutional clients.  
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2643 at 4:14 p.m. in New
York, from $1.2698 yesterday. It depreciated 0.1 percent to
112.05 yen, from 112.18. The yen traded at 88.63 per dollar,
compared with 88.36.  
 The shared currency earlier advanced to $1.2722, the
highest level since May 12, before paring its second consecutive
weekly gain to 0.6 percent. The euro has dropped 16 percent
against the dollar since the beginning of December on concern
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will slow the economic recovery.  
 “The $1.2720 is where the downtrend line for the euro came
in,” Borthwick said.  
 “We’ve come up to some major resistance points to this
risk rebound, which has been the story of the week,” said  Brian Dolan , chief strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of the online
currency trading firm Gain Capital in Bedminster, New Jersey.  
 A resistance level is an area on a chart where orders to
sell may be placed, potentially blocking an advance.  
 Euro Net Shorts  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain dropped to 38,909 on July 6, compared with
record net shorts of 113,890 on May 11, figures from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed today.  
 Canada’s currency  rallied as much as 1.2 percent to
C$1.0296 per U.S. dollar, the strongest level since June 23,
before trading at C$1.0336.  
 Employers added 93,200 jobs in June following an increase
of 24,700 in the previous month, Statistics Canada said today.
The median forecast of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a gain of 20,000. The jobless rate fell to 7.9 percent.  
 Canada has restored most of its job losses since 2008,
bolstering the case for the central bank to raise borrowing
costs for a second month.  
 Canadian ‘Standout’  
 “The standout currency today is the Canadian dollar, as
their employment data was tremendously strong,” said  Adam Cole ,
head of global currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in
London. “The data suggest that if there is a central bank that
can’t be distracted from getting rates back toward normal, it is
the Bank of Canada.”  
 The central bank increased its  target lending rate  to 0.50
percent from a record low 0.25 percent on June 1 after the
nation’s economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized pace in the
first quarter. Policy makers said future moves depend on the
balance of domestic growth and an uneven global recovery.  
 The won climbed to a two-week high after the Bank of Korea
raised its  seven-day repurchase rate  to 2.25 percent from a
record low 2 percent. An increase was forecast by just 4 of 14
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 South Korea’s currency advanced 1.1 percent to 1,195.85 per
dollar after climbing to 1,194.93, the strongest since June 25.  
 Trichet’s Stance  
 The euro had a second weekly gain versus the dollar after
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said at a
press conference in Frankfurt yesterday that “indicators
suggest that a strengthening in economic activity took place
during the spring.” Inflation expectations “remain firmly
anchored,” he also said.  
 The shared currency was supported this week on speculation
stress tests for European banks assumed smaller losses on Greek
bonds than some investors anticipated.  
 European regulators have told lenders their planned tests
may assume a loss of about 17 percent on Greek debt and 3
percent on Spanish bonds, according to two people briefed on the
talks. Credit markets are pricing in losses of about 60 percent
on Greek bonds should the government default.  
 The Chinese yuan was little changed at 6.7730 against the
dollar after U.S. Treasury Department pledged yesterday to
monitor what it called an “undervalued” currency in the next
three months, seeking signs that China is meeting commitments to
help rebalance the global economy.
