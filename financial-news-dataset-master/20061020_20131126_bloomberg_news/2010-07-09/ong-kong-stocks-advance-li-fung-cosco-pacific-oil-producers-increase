             Hong Kong stocks  rose, lifting the
benchmark index to its biggest weekly gain in three months, as
lower U.S. jobless claims fueled confidence in the world’s
biggest economy. Developers gained on speculation Chinese banks
will boost lending for home purchases.  
 Li & Fung Ltd. , the largest supplier to retailers including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., jumped 7.4 percent after announcing
acquisitions. China Resources Land Ltd. led a rally among
mainland property companies after the Oriental Morning Post said
some banks have resumed providing loans for third-home purchases.
 China Shenhua Energy Co.  increased 1.8 percent after Citigroup
Inc. recommended investors buy the stock.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 1.6 percent to close at
20,378.66, extending its gain this week to 2.4 percent. That’s
the measure’s biggest weekly advance since the period ended
April 9. The gauge slumped 3.8 percent last week as reports on
U.S. manufacturing and home sales pointed to slower growth in
the second half of the year.  
 “Exporters, which have been doing well recently, depend a
lot on the U.S. data,” said  Danny Yan , a portfolio manager at
Taifook Asset Management, which oversees $400 million. “This is
only a short rebound. The jobless claims are only one piece of
positive news out in the market.”  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies advanced 2.2 percent to 11,620.68.  
 ECB’s Trichet  
 Stocks climbed after the U.S. government said initial
claims for jobless benefits decreased by 21,000 in the week
ended July 3 to 454,000. Economists had forecast claims would
fall to 460,000, according to the median projection in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Li & Fung, which got 64 percent of its sales from the U.S.
last year, surged 7.4 percent to HK$37.80, the sharpest jump on
the Hang Seng Index. The company entered four licensing deals
and paid $140 million to acquire companies, all of which may
generate $1 billion in sales next year, it said yesterday.  
 Shares also rose after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said Europe’s economy is stronger than some
investors think, and signaled the bank doesn’t intend to do more
to fight the sovereign debt crisis for now.  
 Esprit Holdings Ltd., a clothing retailer that gets 85
percent of its revenue in Europe, rose 4.7 percent to HK$44.20.
HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, gained 1 percent to
HK$73.75.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. , Asia’s No. 3 container-terminal
operator, advanced 1.8 percent to HK$9.54.  
 China Real Estate  
 Developers advanced after the Oriental Morning Post
reported that some Shanghai-based commercial banks have eased
lending policies for second-home purchases.  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of China Ltd. denied the report.
Spokespeople for the three banks said they are complying with a
government order to freeze lending for third homes.  
 The  Hang Seng Property Index ’s 2.4 percent gain was the
biggest among the four industry groups tracked by the Hang Seng
Index.  
 China Resources Land , a state-controlled developer, jumped
4.4 percent to HK$15.52.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. ,
a Hong Kong-based developer controlled by the Chinese
construction ministry, rose 3.1 percent to HK$15.40. Guangzhou
R&F Properties Co., the biggest real estate company in the
southern Chinese city, surged 6.5 percent to HK$10.76.  
 “Property prices are stabilizing, so the lending
environment is getting better,” said Kevin Au, a research
analyst at Phillip Securities Group. “For the longer term, the
trend depends on whether there would be actual announcements
from the government that third-home mortgage loans would be
offered.”  
 The Hang Seng Index has fallen 6.8 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and tighter monetary
policy in China dented confidence in the strength of the global
economy. Shares in the measure are  priced  at an average 13.5
times estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, when
the index hit its high for 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 All but three stocks gained on the 43-member Hang Seng
Index. Futures on the gauge rose 1.9 percent to 20,399.  
 Energy Stocks Climb  
 Shenhua Energy, China’s biggest coal producer, increased
1.8 percent to HK$28.70. Citigroup raised its recommendation on
the stock to “buy” from “hold.”  
 PetroChina Co. , the nation’s No. 1 oil and gas producer,
climbed 2.3 percent to HK$8.76.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest
offshore oil explorer, gained 1.2 percent to HK$13.02. Crude oil
futures climbed 1.9 percent to $75.44 yesterday, the highest
settlement since June 30. Prices rose 0.5 percent in after-hours,
electronic trading.  
 China Eastern Airlines Corp.  jumped 4 percent to HK$3.40.
The airline’s passenger numbers in June rose 70 percent from a
year earlier, China Business News reported.
