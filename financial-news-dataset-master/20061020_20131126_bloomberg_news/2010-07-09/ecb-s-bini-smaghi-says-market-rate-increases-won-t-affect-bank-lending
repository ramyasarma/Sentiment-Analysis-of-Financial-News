             European Central Bank Executive Board
member  Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  said the recent rise in market
interest rates won’t affect bank lending to the rest of the
economy.  
 “It’s a short-term development,” he said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television in Frankfurt today. “It’s not going
to affect ultimately the interest rates banks charge
customers.”  
 Market borrowing costs are rising after banks tapped the
ECB for less funds than expected before paying back a record 442
billion-euro ($559 billion) ECB loan on July 1, reducing excess
liquidity in the system. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday rising market rates don’t reflect any plan by the ECB
to tighten policy.  
 The rate that banks charge each other to borrow for three
months has increased to 0.82 percent, the highest in almost 11
months, from 0.63 percent at the end of March.  The European
Overnight Index Average  rate, or EONIA, rose to 0.542 percent on
June 30 from as low as 0.295 percent on June 3. It was fixed at
0.398 percent yesterday.  
 Some economists and investors are concerned that higher
market rates may hurt Europe’s recovery amid the sovereign debt
crisis and uncertainty about the health of the banking system.  
 Bini Smaghi said he expects a “strong” second quarter
then more “moderate” economic growth. The third quarter will
be “less strong” than the second, he said.  
 “One has to be reasonably optimistic,” Bini Smaghi said,
adding that “lending from banks is picking up.”  
 Loans to the private sector rose 0.2 percent in May from a
year earlier after increasing an annual 0.1 percent in April.
