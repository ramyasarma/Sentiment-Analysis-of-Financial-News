             The Port of Paranagua, Brazil’s
second-biggest soybean port, won an injunction overturning a
suspension of its operations by the nation’s environmental
agency.  
 The port announced the ruling on its website today. Ibama,
as the government agency is known, said yesterday it shut the
port for violating environmental regulations.
