             The  yield  on the 10-year Treasury
note is poised to move higher after failing to break through a
significant technical level this week, according to FTN
Financial.  
 The 10-year note  yield  failed to close below resistance at
2.93 percent this week,  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research
at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a note to clients. “This
type of price action is indicative of a beginning technical
bottom in yields.”  
 Resistance is now at 2.96 percent, while the next support
level is 3.12 percent, Vogel wrote.  
 The yield on the benchmark Treasury note has climbed eight
basis points this week, the most since the five-day period ended
April 2. It dropped to 2.8793 percent on July 1, the lowest
level since April 2009. It touched 3.0592 percent today, the
highest since June 28.  
 Timing on the advance in the yield depends both on the
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and how much
“real money support” develops for the market before 10-year
yields hit 3.20 percent, Vogel wrote. Real money investors
include pension funds, mutual funds and insurers.  
 Support is an area on charts where buy orders may be
clustered, making further price decreases more difficult.
Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. A breach of one level often implies an extension of
the move to the next level.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.

      The U.S. pledged to monitor China’s “undervalued” yuan in the next three months for signs that Asia’s fastest-growing market is living up to its commitments to help rebalance the global economy.
