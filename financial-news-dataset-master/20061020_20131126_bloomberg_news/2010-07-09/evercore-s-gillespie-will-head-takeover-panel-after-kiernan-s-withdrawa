             Robert Gillespie , a senior managing
director at  Evercore Partners Inc ., will be the head of the U.K.
Takeover Panel for the next three years.  
 Gillespie, a former  UBS AG  vice chairman, will head the
regulator through March 31, 2013, the U.K. Takeover Panel said
in a statement today. He’ll start at the regulator on Sept. 6.  
 Gillespie, 55, served as joint global head of UBS
investment banking from 1999 to 2005 before becoming vice
chairman. He joined Evercore in London last year.  
 Peter Kiernan , a Lazard & Co. managing director, had been
scheduled to begin a term as director general of the London-
based panel this year. Kiernan withdrew his offer to serve on
the panel after the regulator criticized Kraft Foods Inc. for
some statements made during its acquisition of Cadbury Plc.
Lazard was Kraft’s lead financial adviser for making
recommendations on merger rules.
