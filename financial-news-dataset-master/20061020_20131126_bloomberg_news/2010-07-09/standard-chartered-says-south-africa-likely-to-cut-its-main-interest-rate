             Razia Khan, an economist at Standard
Chartered Plc, forecast that South Africa’s central bank will
cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 6
percent when it next meets on July 22. She had previously
forecast that rates would be left unchanged.  
 South Africa’s “economic recovery has been weak so far,
and highly dependent on the external environment,” Khan said in
an e-mailed statement.
