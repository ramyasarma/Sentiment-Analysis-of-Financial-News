             BP Plc has designed two timelines for
placing a sealed cap on its leaking Macondo well, allowing up to
nine days with contingency plans if it encounters difficulties,
Robert Dudley, chief executive officer of the company’s Gulf
Coast Restoration organization, told U.S. National Incident
Commander Thad Allen in a letter sent today.
