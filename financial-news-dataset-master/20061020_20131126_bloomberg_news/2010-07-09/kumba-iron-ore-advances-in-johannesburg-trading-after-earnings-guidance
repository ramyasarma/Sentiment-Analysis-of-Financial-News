             Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. , a unit of Anglo
American Plc, rose the most in almost three weeks in
Johannesburg trading after saying first-half profit almost
doubled on higher prices and exports.  
 Earnings excluding one-time items probably climbed to
between 19 rand ($2.51) and 20.55 rand a share from 10.76 rand a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. Final
figures will be released July 22.  
 Shares  in the miner advanced as much as 3.7 percent to
342.60 rand, the steepest gain since June 21. They traded at
339.43 rand as of 10:18 a.m. local time, giving the company a
market value of 109.2 billion rand.  
 Contract export iron-ore prices in the second quarter were
more than 90 percent higher than in the first, the company said.
Export volumes of the steelmaking ingredient rose 10 percent in
the first half from a year earlier, it said.  
 The increase in earnings excludes higher prices the company
charges steelmaker  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. , Kumba said.
While Kumba is charging more for its deliveries to ArcelorMittal
than a year ago, the increase is subject to a dispute.
