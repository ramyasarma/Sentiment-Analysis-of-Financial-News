             Brazilian state pension funds Funcef,
Petrus and Previ will have a stake in the Belo Monte hydropower
dam that will be built in the Amazon, an official with the
state-run electricity company said.  
 Previ, the pension fund of Banco do Brasil SA, Funcef, of
state-controlled bank  Caixa Economica Federal , and Petrus, of
state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, will invest in Belo
Monte to help its construction, said Jose Ailton, engineering
director for Cia. Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco, known as
Chesf.  
 “They will participate, that’s a given,” Ailton said in a
telephone interview today. He declined to say what stake in the
project each pension fund will hold because details are still
being completed.  
 The group led by Chesf, a unit of state-run  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA , won the right to build and operate the
19 billion reais ($10.8 billion) Belo Monte project in an
auction on April 20.  
 Belo Monte is the largest infrastructure project in
President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva’s plan to boost growth and
energy supplies in Latin America’s biggest economy.
