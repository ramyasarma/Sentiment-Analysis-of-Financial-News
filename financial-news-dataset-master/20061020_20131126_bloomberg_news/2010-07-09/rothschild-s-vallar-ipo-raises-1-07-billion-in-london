             Vallar Plc , which raised 707.2
million pounds ($1.07 billion) in a London initial public
offering, favors mining acquisitions involving bulk commodities
such as iron ore and coal in North or South America, founder
 Nathaniel Rothschild  said.  
 Valuations among mid-cap mining companies “look very, very
compelling,” he said today in a telephone interview. “What’s
absolutely certain is that we can buy an asset that is a
multiple of what we’ve raised.”  
 Rothschild, 38, former co-president of New York-based
hedge-fund firm Atticus Capital LLC and the only son of British
financier Jacob Rothschild, tapped investors to help fund a
purchase of a mining business or operation valued at 2 billion
to 5 billion pounds. The  Bloomberg World Mining Index  has
slumped 17 percent in the past three months after metal prices
sank and European countries struggled to contain mounting debt.  
 “The prices of public and private market mining assets are
certainly cheaper than they were three months ago,” analysts at
Liberum Capital Ltd. in London said today in a note to clients.  
 Rothschild, chairman of Vallar’s advisers, co-founder  James Campbell , who is a former chief of coal and base metals at  Anglo
American Plc , and other managers invested 100 million pounds in
Vallar, the company said in a statement.  
 Stock Debut  
 The shares  dropped  9 pence, or 0.9 percent, to 991 pence as
of 12:06 p.m. in London in their first day of trading. The IPO
beat a target announced last month of 600 million pounds.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG coordinated the sale with joint
bookrunner JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. Evolution Securities Ltd. and
Liberum Capital were co-managers.  
 Rothschild, the youngest of four children of Jacob
Rothschild, ranks seventh in the Sunday Times list of the 25
wealthiest U.K.-based hedge-fund managers in an annual estimate
of net worth known as the “ Rich List .” He has an estimated
fortune of 330 million pounds, according to the list published
in April.  
 Vallar  is confident of completing a transaction “well
within” two years and may study assets sold off by “major”
mining companies, he said, adding that Vallar may also consider
buying companies with stressed balance sheets.  
 “We’ve got a shortlist of a handful of ideas,” Rothschild
said. “What we are not trying to do is acquire a series of
lowly rated, mid-size companies to make one lowly rated, large-
cap company.”  
 The acquisition focus will be on stable regions such as
North and South America as well as Australia, and Vallar isn’t
likely to seek targets in Russia initially, he said.  
 “What we are trying to do is to come up with a sensible
industrial plan around a particular commodity or commodities and
try and get what I would call a better rating,” he said. “A
supplier to the carbon steel industry for example.”
