             The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of
commodity shipping costs, fell for the longest period in almost
nine years as declining Chinese steel prices erode the nation’s
iron ore demand.  
 The index of freight rates on international trade routes
fell 38 points, or 2 percent, to 1,902 points today, according
to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Today’s drop was the 31st
straight decline. That’s the longest since the 34 sessions to
Aug. 15, 2001, according to Baltic Exchange prices. Charter
rates for all types of ships tracked by the exchange fell.  
 “We don’t see anything in the next two to three weeks
that’s going to turn the market around,” Guy Campbell, head of
dry bulk at Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker, said
by phone. “Everything is centered on China. We are still
watching China in terms of where the steel price is going.”  
 The price  of hot-rolled steel  in China has declined 17
percent to 3,909 yuan ($577) a metric ton since rising to a 2010
high of 4,698 yuan on April 15, according to prices from Antaike
Information Development. Some of the nation’s mills are
shuttering blast furnaces for maintenance and others are relying
on existing stockpiles instead of imports,  Michael Gaylard ,
strategic director at Freight Investor Services Ltd., said by
phone from Shanghai today.  
 Iron ore creates the single-biggest source of demand for
dry-bulk shipping, according to data from  Clarkson’s research
unit . Trade in the steelmaking ingredient will total 996 million
tons this year. Coal is second-largest at 865 million tons of
seaborne trade. Grains are 315 million tons.  
 ‘Difficult Picture’  
 “It’s a very difficult picture as far as miners are
concerned trying to put together sales” of the raw material,
Gaylard said. The present slump in shipping costs “is going to
continue for July at least,” he said.  
 Charter rates may start to recover starting in September
once Chinese mills have worked through iron ore stockpiles and
need to accelerate purchases again, Clarkson’s Campbell said.  
 Rental rates fell 2 percent to $15,679 a day for  panamax 
vessels, the largest to navigate the Panama Canal, according to
the exchange. They declined 3 percent, to $17,643, for
 capesizes , so called because they have to travel around South
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope or South America’s Cape Horn to
deliver consignments.
