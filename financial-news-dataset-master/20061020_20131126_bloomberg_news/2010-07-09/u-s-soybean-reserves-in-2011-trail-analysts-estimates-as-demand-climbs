             U.S. soybean inventories at the end
of the next marketing year will be smaller than analysts
expected because of rising demand, the government said.  
 Reserves  on Aug. 31, 2011, will total 360 million bushels
(9.8 million metric tons, unchanged from last month, as
increased exports and crushings were offset by a bigger crop,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report. The
average estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
366.4 million bushels. Inventories this year will be 175 million
bushels 5.4 percent less than June’s projection of 185 million.  
 “Demand continues to improve,” said  Bill Nelson , a senior
economist at Doane Advisory Services Co. in St. Louis.
“Soybeans supplies left from last year’s crop will be tight
before this year’s harvest.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 13.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $9.46 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has fallen 9.8 percent this year on forecasts
for record production in Brazil and Argentina, the biggest
exporters after the U.S.  
 Lower inventories may push up prices, increasing feed costs
for meat producers including  Tyson Foods Inc.  and  Smithfield
Foods Inc .  
 U.S. production  is projected to total 3.345 billion
bushels, up from 3.31 billion forecast last month. Last year’s
output was a record 3.359 billion. Average yields in 2010 may
fall to 42.9 bushels an acre from an estimated 44 bushels last
year, the USDA said, unchanged from last month’s forecast. In
June, the department forecast an average yield of 42.9 bushels.  
 U.S. Exports Grow  
 U.S. exports in the marketing year that starts Sept. 1 will
total 1.37 billion bushels, up 1.5 percent from June’s estimate
of 1.35 billion, the USDA said. Shipments for  the current year
were put at 1.46 billion, up from a predicted 1.455 billion last
month.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued last year
at $31.8 billion, government figures show. Corn is the largest
at $48.6 billion.
