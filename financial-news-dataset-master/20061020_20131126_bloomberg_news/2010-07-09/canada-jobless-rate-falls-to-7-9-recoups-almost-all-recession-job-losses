             Canada’s job creation was almost five
times more than economists expected in June, restoring most of
the country’s job losses since 2008 and bolstering the case for
the central bank to raise interest rates for a second month.  
 Employment rose by 93,200 in June, following gains of
24,700 in May and April’s record 108,700, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. The  jobless rate  fell to 7.9 percent, the
lowest since January 2009, from 8.1 percent. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted 20,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate
of 8.1 percent, according to the median of 23 estimates.  
 The job market has been one of the strongest parts of a
Canadian recovery the International Monetary Fund says will lead
advanced economies this year. The Bank of Canada raised its key
lending rate from a record low 0.25 percent June 1 after the
economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized pace in the first
quarter. The bank said future moves depend on the balance of
domestic growth and an uneven global recovery.  
 “You can’t really argue anything in this report,” said
 Benjamin Reitzes , an economist at BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto. “Businesses are confident in our recovery and are
hiring. That should get the ball rolling on growth from a
private sector perspective.”  
 The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.9 percent to C$1.0324 per
U.S. dollar at 11:37 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0420 yesterday.
Earlier it reached C$1.0296, the strongest since June 23. One
Canadian dollar purchases 96.85 U.S. cents.  
 ‘More Normal Setting’  
 The  odds of  the Bank of Canada raising its interest rate to
0.75 percent at its July 20 decision rose to 96 percent today
from 76 percent yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG
calculation derived from overnight index swaps.  
 “The Bank of Canada has to move rates towards a more
normal setting,” said  Meny Grauman , a senior economist at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. He predicts a
1.25 percent benchmark rate at the end of the year.  
 “Our recovery is definitely more on track than most other
countries, especially our neighbors to the south,” Grauman
said. The U.S. Labor Department reported July 2 that private
employers added fewer workers than economists predicted in June,
and a jobless rate of 9.5 percent.  
 Retail and wholesale companies hired 21,600 workers in
June, followed by 20,000 new jobs in business, building and
other support services. Overall service-industry employment rose
by 103,400, while goods-producing companies dropped 10,200
workers.  
 Hiring Plans  
 Full-time  employment increased by 48,900 in June,
Statistics Canada said, and part-time jobs by 44,200. Average
hourly wage  growth  slowed to 1.7 percent in June from a year
ago, compared with 2.4 percent in May.  
 Payroll employment rose by 67,600 in June, and self-
employment rose by 25,600.  
 Canadian National Railway Co. plans to hire as many as
2,000 people annually over the next five years to replace
retiring employees and reduce operating costs, Chief Executive
Officer  Claude Mongeau  said in a July 7 interview in his
Montreal office. Canadian National, the country’s largest
railroad, had 21,501 employees as of Dec. 31.  
 Canada has added 403,000 jobs since July 2009, recouping
almost all of the jobs lost in a slump that began in the second
half of 2008, Statistics Canada said.  
 Employment rose by 1.4 percent or 226,600 jobs in the
second quarter, Statistics Canada said. It was the greatest
increase in employment in records dating to 1976, and the
largest jump in percentage terms since 1983.  
 Ontario Gains  
 Ontario, the country’s most important province for
manufacturing, led the June job gain with 60,300 new positions.
Canadian  factory employment  fell by 14,300, and has dropped by
11.9 percent since October 2008.  
 Linamar Corp. , an Ontario-based automobile parts maker, is
hiring many as 1,300 workers in the province by the end of next
year, said Chief Executive Officer  Linda Hasenfratz .  
 “We have got the work” to boost payrolls, she said in a
telephone interview today from the company’s headquarters in
Guelph. About C$2 billion ($1.94 billion) of business is “under
launch” over the next few years, she said.  
 “Because we have this very significant book of business
that we are launching, even if there is another dip down in
production, the new work that we have coming online should
really help to offset that.”
