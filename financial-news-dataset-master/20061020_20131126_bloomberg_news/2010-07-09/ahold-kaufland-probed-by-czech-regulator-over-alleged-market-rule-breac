             Dutch supermarket owner  Royal Ahold
NV  and German retailer Kaufland Stiftung & Co Kg are being
investigated by a Czech regulator for a possible breach of rules
on market dominance.  
 Ahold, which operates about 300 Albert and Hypernova
supermarkets in the country, and closely held Kaufland are being
probed for the “possible breach of the law about substantial
market power,” Milena Maresova, a spokeswoman for the Czech
Anti-Monopoly Office in Prague, said in an e-mail today. She
didn’t provide further details about the probe.  
 “We are convinced that the way in which we apply a new
law, which is the case here, is the right way and that we
conduct business in the proper manner,”  Jochem van de Laarschot , spokesman for Amsterdam-based Ahold, said by
telephone today. “Of course we’re cooperating fully with the
investigation and are looking forward to the outcome with
confidence.”  
 Kaufland spokesman Michael Sperl confirmed the company is
being investigated but gave no further comment. The
investigation will carry on until the end of next week, he said
in an e-mail.
