             Most Asian  stocks  fell as a Fast
Retailing Co. forecast dragged on Japanese equities,
overshadowing gains by technology companies after U.S. jobless
claims declined.  
 Fast Retailing , Asia’s biggest clothing retailer, sank 1.9
percent in Tokyo after cutting its full-year net income target.
Samsung Electronics Co., which gets a fifth of its revenue in
America, gained 0.5 percent.  Canon Inc. , which gets about 27
percent of its revenue from the Americas jumped 1.3 percent.  
 Nine stocks declined for every seven that advanced in the
 MSCI Asia Pacific Index , which was little changed at 115.16 as
of 9:52 a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has slumped 11 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.  
 Japan’s Topix lost 0.2 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi
index rose 0.5 percent in Seoul. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index 
increased 0.4 percent.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined 0.2
percent. The gauge gained 0.9 percent yesterday after Labor
Department figures showed initial claims for benefits decreased
by 21,000 in the week ended July 3 to 454,000. Economists had
forecast claims would fall to 460,000.
