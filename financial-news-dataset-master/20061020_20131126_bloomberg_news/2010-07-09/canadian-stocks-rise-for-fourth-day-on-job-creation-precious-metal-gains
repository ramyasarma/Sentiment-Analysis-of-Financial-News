             Canadian stocks  rose for a fourth
day, led by banks and gold producers, after a government report
showed the economy created almost five times as many jobs as
economists estimated and metal prices rallied.  
 Research In Motion Ltd.  jumped the most since December
after Reuters reported the BlackBerry maker plans an
applications store and consumer Internet services in China.
Barrick Gold Corp. and other material producers contributed the
most to the gain in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index ,
as gold climbed the most in three weeks.  
 The benchmark for Canadian equities rose 137.08 points, or
1.2 percent, to 11,570.45 in Toronto. The index has climbed 3.3
percent since July 2, the biggest weekly gain since Oct. 9.  
 The jobs report “puts a positive tone to the Canada
economic resilience,” said  Todd Johnson , who helps oversee
about C$200 million ($194 million) as a portfolio manager at BCV
Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba. “Valuations are fair,
given that we’re expanding the economy, consumers are still
spending and businesses are relatively healthy.”  
 The S&P/TSX this week rebounded from an eight-month low as
the International Monetary Fund raised its estimate for global
growth this year, easing concern that a widening European debt
crisis and tightening in China will hinder growth worldwide.  
 The Canadian dollar today advanced against the U.S.
currency after Statistics Canada said payrolls increased by
93,200 in June and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to
7.9 percent, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.1 percent.  
 Canada’s Strength  
 “There is a lot of strength in the Canadian economy,”
said  Chyanne Fickes , who helps manage C$780 million at Stone
Asset Management in Toronto. “Our market’s been following the
U.S., but our economy doesn’t look anything like that of the
U.S. There’s a lot of really good value in the market right
now.”  
 While the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest
rate at a record low since December 2008, the Bank of Canada
raised its lending rate from a record low of 0.25 percent on
June 1 after the economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized pace
in the first quarter. The chance of an increase to 0.75 percent
when the Canadian central bank meets July 20 rose to 96 percent
today from 76 percent yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse
Group AG calculation derived from overnight index swaps.  
 Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s biggest bank, climbed
2.4 percent, the most since April 29, to C$54.37. Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, the fifth largest, advanced 2.7
percent to C$68.70.  
 Barrick, Teck Gain  
 Barrick, the world’s biggest gold producer, increased 1.4
percent to C$45.04. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-
metals producer, increased 3.4 percent to C$35.60 as copper
capped a weekly gain.  
 Research In Motion rallied 7 percent to C$55.23 for the
 biggest gain  in the S&P/TSX. Canada’s biggest technology company
is making a push into the world’s largest mobile phone market,
Reuters reported, citing the company’s head of China operations.  
 Canadian National Railway Co.  fell 0.7 percent to C$60.70
after being downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at
JPMorgan Chase & CO.  
 Crombie Real Estate Investment Trust, which calls itself
the largest landlord in Canada’s Atlantic provinces, dropped 1.3
percent to C$11.15 after saying it would sell at least 2.67
million units at C$11.05.  
 West 49 Inc.  jumped 9.4 percent to C$1.40, the highest
price since July 2007. The skateboarding, snowboarding and
surfing apparel retailer said Zumiez Inc. in the U.S. plans to
make an offer to trump Billabong International Ltd.’s bid of
C$1.30 a share.
