             Massachusetts’s property insurer of
last resort sold $96 million of catastrophe bonds to protect
against hurricane damage in a deal managed by  Munich Re .  
 The three-year securities, issued on behalf of the
 Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association , will
pay 7 percentage points more than three-month Treasury bills,
Munich Re said today in a statement.  
 Massachusetts ranks fourth in the U.S. in the value of
insured coastal property, behind Florida, New York and Texas,
according to 2007 data from catastrophe-modeling firm AIR
Worldwide. The buyers of the securities, including European
institutional investors, could forfeit their principal to the
insurer if a severe enough hurricane strikes.  
 “Capital markets constitute a good complementary risk
carrier for specialized peak risks like Massachusetts
hurricane,” said  Tony Kuczinski , president and chief executive
officer for the U.S. division of Munich Re, the world’s largest
reinsurer.  
 The Massachusetts insurance association was created by the
state to provide coverage for property owners who couldn’t buy
policies in the private market.
