             OAO MegaFon, Russia’s third-largest
mobile phone operator, may carry out one or two more
acquisitions this year, possibly expanding again in the wireless
business after it bought a fixed-line provider.  
 “We have many projects in the pipeline we would like to
buy,” including fixed-line and wireless operators, MegaFon Chief
Executive Officer Sergei Soldatenkov said in an interview July
7. “I would like to have one or two more acquisitions, perhaps
not as big as Synterra.”  
 MegaFon, part-owned by  TeliaSonera AB , agreed last month to
pay $745 million for Synterra, a Russian telecommunications
operator. Its larger wireless rivals, OAO VimpelCom and OAO
Mobile TeleSystems, made acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 to branch
out beyond mobile phone calls to benefit from growing Internet
demand in the country of 142 million people.  
 Broadband Internet subscribers in Russia reached 11.6
million last year, double 2007’s total, Advanced Communications
& Media estimates. That may rise to 15.5 million this year and
26 million in 2012, Alexander Shatikov, a partner at the Moscow-
based research company, said today. Russia aims to introduce
broadband Internet nationwide in the next five years,
Communications Minister Igor Shchegolev said in May.  
 “Traffic is growing at a wild pace,” with an eightfold
increase in data transmission in the first five months of this
year from a year earlier, Soldatenkov said. “We of course are
trying to invest as much as we can in the network to meet
demands of our subscribers.”  
 Increasing Investment  
 MegaFon has invested more than 200 billion rubles ($6.5
billion) in the past five years, the CEO said. The company said
July 2 that it will increase investment 13 percent to 60.5
billion rubles this year to build up its 3G network in  Russia .  
 Soldatenkov said talks are under way with Akado, a Moscow-
based provider of Internet and cable television owned by
billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg . Soldatenkov declined to comment
on reports Vekselberg is seeking $1 billion for Akado.  
 MegaFon aims to use the Synterra purchase to break into the
market of state contracts, Soldatenkov said. MegaFon will also
take control of Synterra’s networks and may sell or swap some
excess capacity. Synterra owns regional telecommunications
operators in Russia.  
 “I hope by the end of the first quarter next year we will
have a network comparable to that of TransTelecom or Rostelecom
by capacity,” the CEO said, referring to OAO Rostelecom,
Russia’s dominant long-distance call operator, and ZAO
TransTeleCom, the telecommunications provider controlled by OAO
Russian Railways.  
 Financing Acquisitions  
 MegaFon announced last year plans to raise as much as
$1.5 billion in so-called Euro medium-term notes. Its board
hasn’t voted on the program, Soldatenkov said, adding the
company would issue the notes as needed rather than selling the
entire amount in one go.  
 This year “it may happen, if we have further
acquisitions,” he said. “So far we bought Synterra without
using this instrument.”  
 MegaFon predicts revenue will grow 10 percent to 11 percent
this year from last year’s 181.9 billion rubles, Soldatenkov
reiterated. The company wants to top MTS and VimpelCom on
revenue from operations in Russia this year, he said.  
 Apart from acquisitions, MegaFon also seeks to increase its
national retail network of directly owned outlets to as many as
1,500 in the next two years. The company now has 620 own outlets
and sells through other dealer networks.  
 International Presence  
 MegaFon, which has more than 53 million subscribers in
Russia, the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan and the
disputed Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
isn’t looking to expand internationally, the CEO said. Markets
in other former Soviet republics have been snapped up by
competitors, he added.  
 Soldatenkov also said he “does not see synergy” for
MegaFon if shareholders TeliaSonera and Alfa Group merge their
holdings in the Russian company with those in Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS. TeliaSonera and billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s  Alfa Group  last year agreed to combine their stakes in MegaFon
and  Turkey ’s biggest mobile-phone service to create a new
company.  
 “What will it change for us?” he said. “The Turkish market
is totally different; there could not be any synergies when the
operators are developing on different territories.”  
 TeliaSonera,  Sweden ’s largest phone company, controls
43.8 percent in MegaFon, Alfa Group holds 25.1 percent and AF
Telecom Holding, controlled by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, has
a 31.1 percent stake.
