             Syria’s government has offered 74,000
square-kilometers of land, or 40 percent of the country, to
international oil and gas companies for exploration,  Al Thawra

seeking the restoration of old wells where production ceased in
the past several years, the newspaper reported.  
 About 10 oil companies are currently exploring sites in
Syria, including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and PetroCanada, although
production is yet to start, the newspaper said.
