             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
would lose an election to Socialist Party Secretary General
 Martine Aubry  were one held today, a  CSA poll for the LCP
television  channel suggested.  
 In France’s two-round system for presidential elections,
Sarkozy would have 31 percent support in the first vote, while
Aubry would win 30 percent, the poll indicated. In the second
round, in which the two leading candidates face off, Aubry would
get 52 percent of the votes compared with 48 percent for
Sarkozy, CSA said.  
 The figures highlight how Sarkozy’s popularity is flagging
as his government and Union for a Popular Movement party have
become embroiled in expenses scandals and bribery allegations.
The president is also facing opposition to his plans to push
through an increase in the retirement age.  
 Three years into a five-year term, Sarkozy’s approval
rating is at the lowest since he took office. Thirty-two percent
of voters say they have confidence in him, according to a
 separate CSA poll  published in today’s Parisien newspaper.  
 Both polls were carried out July 7 and yesterday. CSA
interviewed 809 voters for voting intentions and 1,002 voters
for the confidence rating. No margins of error were given.
