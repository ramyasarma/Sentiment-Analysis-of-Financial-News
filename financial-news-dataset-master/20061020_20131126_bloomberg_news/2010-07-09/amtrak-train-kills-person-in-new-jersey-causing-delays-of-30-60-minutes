             Amtrak said passengers traveling on
the Northeast Corridor between New York City and Philadelphia
can expect delays of 30 minutes to 60 minutes, because of police
activity.  
 A train struck and killed a person around 3:20 p.m. local
time near Metro Park, New Jersey, Amtrak said in an e-mailed
statement.
