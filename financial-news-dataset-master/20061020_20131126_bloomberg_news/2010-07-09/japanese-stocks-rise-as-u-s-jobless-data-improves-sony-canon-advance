             Japanese  stocks  rose, driving the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its biggest weekly gain this year,
after a drop in U.S. jobless claims stoked optimism in the
global economy.  
 Sony Corp., an electronics maker that gets 21 percent of
its revenue from the U.S., gained 0.9 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. , a
maker of earthmoving machines that gets about 22 percent of its
sales from China, climbed 2 percent on speculation China’s
government will wind back steps to curb property prices.  Inpex
Corp. , Japan’s biggest oil explorer, plunged 13 percent on plans
to sell shares. Banks declined ahead of a stock sale by Mizuho
Financial Group Inc.  
 “The market had been worried about a double dip, but we’re
seeing that won’t happen,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a fund
manager in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $6 billion. “There are still concerns about further share
sales. The news about Inpex was bad, and we’re waiting for
Mizuho, which is leading to selling of related stocks.”  
 The  Nikkei 225  rose 0.5 percent to 9,585.32 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, reversing a 0.2 percent drop. The broader
Topix index was little changed at 861.21, with about eight
stocks advancing for every seven that declined. The Nikkei
jumped 4.1 percent this week, the most since the week ended Dec.
4. The Topix climbed 3.6 percent, the most since Jan. 8.  
 The Nikkei 225 has tumbled 9.1 percent this year as
Europe’s deficit crisis and China’s measures to curb real-estate
prices fueled concern about global economic growth. Companies on
the gauge trade at 17.8 times estimated earnings, compared with
13.1 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in the U.S. and
11.5 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 U.S. Jobless Claims  
 Sony  gained 0.9 percent to 2,445 yen. Hitachi Ltd., which
gets about 40 percent of its revenue outside Japan, climbed 2.1
percent to 345 yen. Olympus Corp., which counts the U.S. as its
biggest market outside Japan, advanced 2.9 percent to 2,275 yen.  
 The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits
decreased by 21,000 in the week ended July 3 to 454,000, Labor
Department figures showed in Washington. Economists had forecast
claims would fall to 460,000 from an initially reported 472,000
for the prior week, according to the median of 36 projections in
a Bloomberg survey.  
 “U.S. employment data had been causing concern about the
strength of the recovery and expectations that jobs would
decline had been priced into the market,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Tokyo-based Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. “The jobless data shows an improvement, and
the likelihood of a double dip in the economy is shrinking.”  
 Canon Climbs  
 Canon Inc. , the world’s biggest maker of cameras and office
equipment, increased 1 percent to 3,480 yen. Operating profit
for the first half of the year may have almost tripled to about
182 billion yen ($2.06 billion) on better-than-anticipated sales
of digital single-lens-reflex cameras and laser printers, Nikkei
English News reported, without citing anyone.  
 Japanese machinery makers with business in China climbed on
speculation demand for their products will increase. Some
Shanghai-based commercial banks have resumed providing loans for
third-home purchases and have eased lending policies for second-
home purchases, Oriental Morning Post reported.  
 Komatsu gained 2 percent to 1,725 yen.  Fanuc Ltd. , an
industrial-robot maker that receives almost half of its revenue
from Asia outside Japan, increased 2.3 percent to 10,710 yen.
 Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. , which counts China as its
biggest market, rose 0.5 percent to 1,714 yen.  
 Share Sales  
 Inpex plunged 13 percent to 415,000 yen, its lowest level
on record and the steepest  decline  on the Nikkei 225. The oil
producer, which has proposed a $20 billion natural-gas project
in northern Australia, said yesterday that it plans to raise as
much as 587.2 billion yen in a share sale, the biggest such
transaction this year in Japan by a non-financial institution.  
 Banks were the biggest drag on the Topix among its 33
industry groups.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s
largest bank by market value, sank 0.5 percent to 426 yen.
 Shinsei Bank Ltd.  lost 2.7 percent to 72 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value, dropped 2.2 percent 2,621 yen.  
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest publicly
traded bank, plans to raise as much as 857.6 billion yen to meet
new capital rules after booking losses during the financial
crisis, the company said on June 25. The lender will price the
shares between July 13 and July 15 and may sell up to 6 billion
new shares, it said. Mizuho’s stock rose 0.7 percent to 142 yen.  
 “The deadline for Mizuho and its share sale is next week,
so people are probably selling other bank stocks to raise cash
to buy its shares,” said  Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee $2.2
billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  
 Japan has scheduled upper-house elections on July 11. The
ruling Democratic Party of Japan is unlikely to win a majority
in the chamber, the Nikkei newspaper said, citing an opinion
poll. That may hamper passage of party-backed laws to reduce the
budget deficit and increase spending on social services.
