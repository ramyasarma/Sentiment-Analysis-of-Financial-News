             AccessKenya Ltd. , the country’s only
publicly traded Internet company, named  Daniel Ndonye  as its
chairman.  
 Ndonye replaces  Michael Somen , who resigned after a board
decision “that the Chairman shall be an independent non-
executive director,” the company said in a statement on its
website today.  
 The former chairman is the father of Managing Director
 Jonathan Somen  and has headed the board since its inception 10
years ago. He will remain as a board member, the company said.  
 Ndonye worked at Deloitte East Africa for 20 years, 10 of
which he served as managing partner, until his retirement in May
2010, it said.
