             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s largest shipyard, won a court’s approval to buy Hyundai
Oilbank Co. from International Petroleum Investment Co. of the
United Arab Emirates for control of the South Korean refiner.  
 Seoul’s Central District Court accepted Hyundai Heavy’s
claim to buy 70 percent of  Hyundai Oilbank  shares from IPIC, an
Abu Dhabi government investment arm, Judge Chang Jae Yoon said
today. The shipyard currently owns 21.13 percent of the
country’s smallest refiner.  
 Hyundai Heavy needs to pay 2.57 trillion won ($2.1 billion)
for Hyundai Oilbank in its biggest acquisition as the shipyard
tries to reduce its dependency on building vessels. Global
orders for new ships have slumped since the third quarter of
2008 as the credit crisis made it difficult to obtain loans and
trade shrank.
