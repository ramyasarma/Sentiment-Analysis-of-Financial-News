             Corn futures fell from a five-month
high after a government forecast on inventories topped estimates
by analysts in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer.  
 Reserves will be 1.373 billion bushels by Aug. 31, 2011,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report. The
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
1.292 billion. This year, stockpiles will be 1.478 billion, the
agency said. Before today, corn jumped 15 percent since June 29
after the USDA said that farmers planted less then intended.  
 “People were a little disappointed,” said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. “We had a big rally, so traders are lightening up on
some positions.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.95 a bushel at 10:34 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Yesterday, the most-active contract reached $3.975, the
highest level since Jan. 12.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
