             Paul, the octopus that has correctly
predicted all of Germany’s matches at the World Cup, predicted
today a Spanish victory over the Netherlands in July 11’s World
Cup final in Johannesburg when he selected a mussel from
labelled glass tanks.  
 The octopus oracle from the Sea Life Aquarium in
Oberhausen, Germany, correctly predicted his homeland’s wins
over Argentina, England, Australia and Ghana and the country’s
losses to Serbia and Spain.
