             Paul, the octopus that has correctly
predicted all of Germany’s matches at the World Cup, forecast a
Spanish victory over the Netherlands in the World Cup final.  
 It took the two-year old octopus from the  Sea Life Aquarium 
in Oberhausen, Germany about a minute today to select a mussel
from a glass tank labelled Spain. Paul earlier picked Germany to
win third place tomorrow in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  
 The octopus oracle correctly predicted his homeland’s wins
over Argentina, England, Australia and Ghana and the country’s
losses to Serbia and Spain. The Netherlands twice lost soccer
World Cup finals in the 1970s, while Spain will play its first
on July 11 in Johannesburg.  
 “What nationality is the octopus?” Monique Kessels, a
spokeswoman for the Dutch Football Association, asked by
telephone from South Africa, declining to further comment.  
 Paul was born in Weymouth, England, in January 2008, Sea
Life confirmed by telephone today. While he has a perfect record
for this tournament before this weekend’s matches, he wrongly
predicted that Germany would beat Spain in the final of the Euro
2008 tournament. Spain won that match 1-0.
