             BlackRock Inc . named  Mike Latham 
global head of its iShares exchange-traded fund unit as part of
a reorganization that unites U.S. and non-U.S. portions of the
business.  
 Latham, 44, was previously head of North American iShares,
the New York-based firm said today in an e-mailed statement.
 Rory Tobin , 44, head of the international iShares business,
decided to leave BlackRock, the company said.  
 BlackRock acquired iShares Dec. 1 in its $15.2 billion
purchase of San Francisco-based Barclays Global Investors from
Barclays Plc in London. IShares is the largest provider of ETFs,
with $481.2 billion in assets, or 46 percent of the global
market, as of May 31, according to BlackRock.  
 “To optimize our ETF operations worldwide, we’ve decided
to reorganize iShares to manage it on a uniform, global basis,”
 Bobbie Collins , a BlackRock spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview.  
 IShares’ international business will be overseen by  Nick Good  in Asia,  Daniel Gamba  in Latin America and  Joe Linhares  in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  
 Latham joined BGI in 1994 and was chief operating officer
of U.S. iShares before heading North American operations. A
graduate of California State University at San Francisco, he was
named to iShares’ board of directors and board of trustees in
May.  
 Staying the Course  
 “Appointing Latham is a signal from BlackRock that they’re
supporting the direction iShares has already gone,”  David Nadig , director of research for Index Publications LLC in
Decatur, Georgia, which publishes a website covering the ETF
industry, said in a telephone interview. “They didn’t bring in
someone from BlackRock or look for someone from outside.”  
 Tobin had worked at iShares since 2004.  
 IShares lost $7.7 billion, or 1.6 percent, of assets in the
first five months of 2010, according to BlackRock data. Boston-
based State Street Corp., iShares’ closest rival, lost $12
billion, or 7.4 percent, to $149 billion, BlackRock said.
Vanguard Group Inc. of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the third-
largest player, gained $12.3 billion, or 13 percent, to $104.4
billion.  
 Unlike mutual funds, which can take deposits or make
redemptions once a day, ETFs trade on an exchange all day like
stocks. Their assets increased by less than 1 percent this year
to $1.04 trillion as of May 31, according to BlackRock.
