             Soybeans rose to an eight-week high
on speculation that China, the biggest consumer, will purchase
more of the oilseed from the U.S. to make up for reduced
domestic output.  
 U.S. exporters sold 116,000 metric tons to China for
delivery after Aug. 31, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. China’s soybean crop was hurt by temperatures that
reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) in northeast
regions during the past seven days and too much rain in the
south during the past month, said  Fred Gesser , a senior
meteorologist at Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.  
 “Chinese crops have been damaged,” said  David Smoldt , the
vice president of operations for FCStone LLC in West Des Moines,
Iowa. “China will be buying more soybeans” to feed an
expanding livestock herd and as more processing plants are
built, Smoldt said.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 7.25 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $9.5325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade
after earlier touching $9.5875, the highest price since May 14.
The most-active futures rose 5.2 percent this week, the biggest
gain since November.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion last year, behind corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.
