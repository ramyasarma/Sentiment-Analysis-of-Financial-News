             Bank of America Corp. hired former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director  Yozo Tachibana  to
head fixed income, currencies and commodities sales in Japan,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  
 Tachibana, 39, joined Bank of America as a managing
director yesterday to help win new clients in Japan and deliver
Japanese products to its global customers, according to the memo.
 Tsukasa Noda , a Tokyo-based spokesman at the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank’s Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co. unit,
confirmed the contents of the memo.  
 Tachibana previously was managing director of  Goldman
Sachs ’s merchant banking division in Japan. He was also the head
of the New York-based company’s institutional, international,
yen flow, and yen non-flow sales group.  
 The banker is at least the fifth person to be hired by Bank
of America in the country from a rival. The company in April
recruited  Tomomi Kikuchi  from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to head sales
of mortgage-backed securities in Japan.
