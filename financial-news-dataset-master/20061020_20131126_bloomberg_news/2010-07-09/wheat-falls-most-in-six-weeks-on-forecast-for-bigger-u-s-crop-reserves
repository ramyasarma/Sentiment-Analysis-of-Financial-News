             Wheat futures fell the most in six
weeks after the government predicted that U.S. inventories will
rise because of better-than-forecast production.  
 U.S. reserves as of May 31 will rise 12 percent to 1.093
billion bushels from a year earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Production will be 2.216
billion bushels, more than the 2.164 billion forecast by 16
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices jumped 20 percent in
the previous six sessions.  
 “Yields have been just as good and getting better as the
harvest moves on,” said  Louise Gartner , the owner of Spectrum
Commodities in Beavercreek, Ohio.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 10.5 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $5.38 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest decline since May 28.  
 Farmers have been reporting improved yields in the southern
Great Plains, where hard-red winter varieties are grown, said
 Jason Britt , the president of Central States Commodities Inc. in
Kansas City, Missouri.  
 “The last couple weeks, they’ve been bumping up the
yields,” Britt said. “There’s still wheat piled up on the
ground here in Kansas.”  
 Today, the USDA lowered its world-production estimate for
the current marketing year by 1.1 percent to 661.1 million tons
as adverse weather in Canada and Russia hurt crop prospects.  
 Output estimates in Canada, where wet weather curbed
seeding, were lowered 16 percent to 20.5 million tons. The USDA
lowered the forecast for Russian production by 7.8 percent to 53
million tons because of hot, dry conditions.  
 The U.S. is the world’s biggest shipper, followed by
Canada, Australia and Russia.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
