             China’s home-appliance makers may 
raise export prices to mitigate the impact of a rising yuan, 
the China Daily reported, citing companies and industry 
officials.   
 Guangdong Galanz Enterprise Co., the world’s largest 
microwave-oven maker, will miss its earlier full-year profit 
estimate because of the yuan’s appreciation and rising labor 
costs, the paper said, citing the company’s export director 
Jackie Liu. Almost 60 percent of the company’s output is 
exported and labor costs have risen 50 percent, he said.  
 Galanz is now seeking export prices based on an exchange 
rate of 6.77 yuan to the U.S. dollar from a previous 6.83 yuan,
he said.  
 Haier Group Co. may increase prices to offset the pressure 
of currency appreciation, the English-language newspaper said, 
without citing anyone.
