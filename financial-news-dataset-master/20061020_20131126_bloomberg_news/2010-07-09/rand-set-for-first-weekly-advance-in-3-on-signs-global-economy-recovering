             South African shares and the rand
advanced for the first week in three on signs the global
economic recovery will remain on track.  
 BHP Billiton Plc , the world’s largest mining company, and
 Anglo American Plc  rallied as metals gained. The  FTSE/JSE Africa
All Share Index  climbed 0.8 percent to 27,272.31 at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, bringing its weekly gain to 3.6 percent.
The currency of Africa’s biggest economy strengthened for a
fourth day as investors bought higher-yielding emerging-market
assets.  
 South Korea unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate
today for the first time since the global crisis, a sign of
confidence in the economic recovery. European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday Europe’s economy is
stronger than some investors think after the bank left its
benchmark rate at a record low of 1 percent. The world economy
will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the biggest gain since 2007,
the International Monetary Fund said this week.  
 Citigroup Inc. raised its recommendation on South African
stocks to “neutral” as the country is “showing signs of
recovery,” according to a note today.  
 Billiton gained for a fourth day, rising 2.3 percent to
213.27 rand, while Anglo American advanced 0.8 percent to 279.15
rand. The  S&P GSCI Total Return Index  of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 1.1 percent and is headed for a 4.3 percent increase
for the week, the biggest weekly gain since the five days ending
April 2.

 The rand appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 7.5452 per
dollar before trading at 7.5905, from a previous close of
7.5915. The move extended the rand’s weekly gain to 1.9 percent.  
 “Sentiment around the global economy is a lot better
thanks to Trichet’s comments and the fact that the IMF has
upgraded its growth forecasts,” said  Brigid Taylor , a senior
currency trader at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg. “Markets
are feeling a lot better, especially around the eurozone’s
prospects, and that bodes well for the rand.”  
 Emerging-market assets have weakened this year on concern
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will hurt the global economy’s
recovery from last year’s recession. South African Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said late yesterday that growth in
Africa’s biggest economy “moderated somewhat” in the second
quarter, though the economy is still on track to expand more
than 2.3 percent in 2010.  
 Government bonds were rallied for a fourth day, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rising 29
cents to 124.08 rand. The yield slid 6 basis points to 7.75
percent.  
 Investors maintained bets the central bank will lower its
6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in three months  was steady at 6.285 percent,
the lowest since the central bank introduced the repurchase rate
in 1999.
