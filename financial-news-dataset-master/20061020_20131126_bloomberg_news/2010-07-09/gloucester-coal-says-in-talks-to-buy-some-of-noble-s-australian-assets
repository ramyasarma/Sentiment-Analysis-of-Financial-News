             Gloucester Coal Ltd.  said it’s in
talks with largest shareholder  Noble Group Ltd.  to buy some of
its Australian assets and has made no decision on any share sale.  
 “No agreement has been reached between Gloucester and
Noble,” Sydney-based Gloucester said today in a statement,
reiterating comments made on June 21.  
 Gloucester is preparing to sell A$500 million ($438 million)
in shares to buy assets from Hong Kong-based Noble, the
Australian Financial Review reported today. No decision has been
made about any capital raising, Gloucester said in the statement.  
 Gloucester may buy stakes in the Middlemount and Monto
projects, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information. Gloucester is being advised by UBS AG and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, it said.  
 Gloucester declined 1 cent to A$12.42 at 10:42 a.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange. Noble  owns 92.5 percent 
of Gloucester and has made an offer of A$12.60 each for the
balance of the shares.
