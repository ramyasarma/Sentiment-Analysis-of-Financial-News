             A rebound in  Chinese stocks , the
worst performers in Asia this year, may be imminent after
reaching a near-term low, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. said, citing
two technical indicators.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index fell on July 2 to as low as
2,319.74, which is “probably a near-term bottom,” CIMB
analysts  Nigel Foo  and  Kong Seh Siang  wrote in a report today.
The gauge’s daily  Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
indicator  and relative strength index are signaling a possible
rebound in the index, according to the analysts.  
 “The daily MACD and RSI have been showing positive
divergence signs since May, signaling an imminent change in the
downtrend,” the analysts wrote.  
 The  Shanghai Composite  has dropped 26 percent this year
amid concern that policy tightening and Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will hurt the nation’s economic growth. The index added
0.1 percent to 2,416.68 as of 10:31 a.m. local time.  
 Should the Chinese stock index fall below this week’s low
of 2,319, the CIMB analysts have a target of 2,270 to 2,280
points, according to the report.  
 Nomura Holdings Inc. said this week the CSI 300 Index,
which tracks yuan-denominated shares traded on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, is in a “good position” to recover after
it touched the bottom band that marked this year’s downward
trend.  
 Its 14-day RSI, a gauge of how rapidly prices gain or
decline, also suggests Chinese stocks are “oversold,”
according to a July 7 report by Nomura analysts Kenneth Chan,
 Tacky Cheng  and  Desmond Chan .  
 Stocks elsewhere in  Asia  outside of Japan have already
started rebounding after finding a “near-term bottom” this
week, according to the CIMB analysts.  
 The MSCI Asia excluding Japan Index, which has climbed 3
percent from the July 6 low of 453.63, may extend gains to
between 469 and 472, which is the 50 percent and 61.8 percent
 retracement  of its June decline, the analysts said. The 472
level also marks its 200-day simple moving average resistance,
they said.
