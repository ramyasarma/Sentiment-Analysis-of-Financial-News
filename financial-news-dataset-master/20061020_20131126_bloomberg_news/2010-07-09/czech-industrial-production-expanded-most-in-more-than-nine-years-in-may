             Czech industrial output rose at the
fastest pace since January 2001 on rising demand for
manufactured goods including vehicles, metal products.  
 Production  increased  an annual 16.9 percent in May,
compared with growth of 10.9 percent in the previous month, the
statistics office in Prague said on its website today. Before
December, output declined for 14 consecutive months. The median
forecast of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an
increase of 15 percent.  
 The Finance Ministry on April 29 raised its forecast for
economic growth this year to 1.5 percent from 1.3 percent on
expectations of improved demand for exports, such as Skoda Auto
AS cars, which make up about 70 percent of output.  
 Construction output rose 0.5 percent in May, the first
monthly growth since December, the statistics office said in a
separate statement today.
