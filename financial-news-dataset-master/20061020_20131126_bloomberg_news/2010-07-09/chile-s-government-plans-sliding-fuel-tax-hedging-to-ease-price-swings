             Chile’s government will submit a
proposal to Congress next week that would replace a fuel
stabilization fund with a mechanism that uses a sliding tax rate
to ease price swings, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said.  
 The proposed model, called SIPCO for its Spanish acronym,
calls for increasing fuel taxes when international prices drop
and decreasing taxes when prices increase, Larrain told
reporters today in Santiago.  
 The model would replace price stabilization programs for
gasoline and diesel that cost the state $2.34 billion from 2000
to 2009 with a program that doesn’t cost the government
anything, Larrain said. Chile is studying ways to trim outlays
as it seeks to fund rebuilding after a February earthquake that
did $30 billion in damage.  
 “These programs are neither designed to collect funds nor
create subsidies,” he said. “We’ll ask Congress to fast track
this proposal, which we don’t think will be conflictive because
it will protect consumers.”  
 The government is planning a second phase of the program
that would use hedges to protect against price changes, Larrain
said.
