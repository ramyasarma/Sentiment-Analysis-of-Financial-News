will show housing starts and a measure of the outlook for
economic growth fell.  
 The implied yield fell two basis points to 3.25 percent as
of 7:52 a.m. in Singapore, according to data compiled by

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li from Santa Clara, California, about the outlook for sales.
     Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts' estimates with its forecast for this period, allaying concern that a rebound in technology spending is losing steam. Smith also discusses the company's investments in China. (Source: Bloomberg)
