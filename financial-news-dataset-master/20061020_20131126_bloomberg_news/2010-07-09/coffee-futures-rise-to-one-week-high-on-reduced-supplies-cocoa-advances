             Arabica-coffee futures rose to the
highest price in a week on reduced supplies. Cocoa also jumped.  
 Coffee exports from producing countries will fall for a
second year in 2010 amid “scarcity,” according to the
International Coffee Organization. Shipments will be below last
year’s estimated 95.5 million bags and 97.7 million in 2008, ICO
Executive Director  Nestor Osorio  said yesterday in an interview,
without specifying the amount or percentage drop. A bag of
coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  
 Supplies of the mild, washed arabica beans traded on ICE
Futures U.S. “remain tight so the market should remain at a
higher trading range,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at
Price Group Inc., a broker in Chicago.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 1.75 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.6385 a pound on ICE in New York. Earlier, the
commodity touched $1.672, the highest level for a most-active
contract since July 2. The price fell 0.3 percent this week.  
 Through yesterday,  stockpiles  monitored by ICE Futures
tumbled 30 percent this year to the lowest level since August
2002. Futures have climbed 42 percent in the past year.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery gained $13,
or 0.8 percent, to $1,709 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery gained $27, or 0.9
percent, to $2,996 a metric ton on ICE. The most-active contract
gained 0.8 percent for the week and 13 percent in the 12 months.  
 On London’s Liffe, cocoa futures for September delivery
rose 5 pounds, or 0.2 percent, to 2,385 pounds ($3,591) a ton.
