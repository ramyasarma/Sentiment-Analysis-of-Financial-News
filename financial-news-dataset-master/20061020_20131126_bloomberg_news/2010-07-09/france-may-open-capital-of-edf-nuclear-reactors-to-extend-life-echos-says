             French senators considering the
reform of the country’s electricity market have adopted an
amendment that would allow alternative suppliers to take stakes
in nuclear reactors controlled by Electricite de France SA, Les
Echos reported.  
 The newspaper cited Ladislas Poniatowski, the senator
preparing the reform. Allowing EDF’s competitors to invest 500
million euros in a reactor for a stake of 10 percent to 20
percent would increase the lifespan of such facilities, the
newspaper said.  
 Les Echos cited the head of E.ON AG’s French unit, Luc
Poyet, as saying that he’s in favor of the idea.
