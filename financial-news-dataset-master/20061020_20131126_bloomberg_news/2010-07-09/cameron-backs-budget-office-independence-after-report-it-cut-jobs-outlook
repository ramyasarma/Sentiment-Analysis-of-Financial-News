             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
office defended the independence of the government’s new
forecasting body after the Financial Times reported it had
reduced its predictions for job losses.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  set up the
Office for Budget Responsibility in May, saying it would
“rebuild confidence” in government economic forecasts. The FT
reported today that the OBR had lowered by 175,000 its estimates
for public-sector job losses as a result of last month’s budget,
using assumptions about government spending decisions that
aren’t yet policy.  
 “The most important thing is that this is the OBR’s
forecast,” Cameron’s spokesman  Steve Field  told reporters in
London today. Asked if the OBR had been put under pressure, he
repeated, “This is their forecast.”  
 The Treasury confirmed on July 6 that Alan Budd, appointed
in June as interim chairman of the OBR, will step down shortly.
Former Chancellor  Alistair Darling , the economy spokesman for
the opposition Labour Party, said the new body’s “very
credibility is at stake.”  
 “Right from the start the Tories used the OBR not just as
part of the government but as part of the Conservative Party,”
Darling said in an e-mail. “They have succeeded in strangling
what could have been a good idea at its birth.”
