             Taiwan ’s insurance regulator may
issue rules letting local insurers invest in  Chinese  securities
before the end of September after the two sides signed an
agreement last month to widen access to each other’s markets.  
 The plan needs to be approved first by the Executive Yuan,
or cabinet,  Wu Chung-Chuan , secretary-general of the insurance
bureau at the  Financial Supervisory Commission , said in a
telephone interview today from Taipei.  
 Taiwan and China on June 29 signed an accord to cut tariffs
and ease access to services including banking, securities and
insurance. Cross-strait relations have reached their warmest in
60 years after President  Ma Ying-jeou  took office in May 2008,
dropping a pro-independence stance and making economic relations
with the mainland a priority for his administration.  
 Insurers in Taiwan including Cathay Life Insurance Co. and
Shin Kong Life Insurance Co. can invest in China after gaining
the status of a qualified foreign institutional investor, or
QFII, on the mainland, Wu said. China has agreed to hasten the
approval process, according to last month’s accord.  
 The regulator may allow domestic insurers to invest about
10 percent of the overseas investment quota in Chinese
securities including stocks, bonds, funds and exchanged-traded
funds, Wu said.  
 Insurance companies in Taiwan can now invest as much as 45
percent of their total assets abroad. As of the end of March,
insurers had assets of NT$11.4 trillion ($356 billion), and have
invested NT$3.1 trillion overseas, according to data on the
regulator’s website.
