             U.K. 10-year government bonds rose,
snapping three days of losses, as a drop in U.S. stocks revived
demand for the safety of fixed-income assets.  
 The gain sent the yield  premium  investors demand for 10-
year gilts rather than German bunds to the narrowest since
February. U.K. producer prices dropped in June for the first
time in 1 1/2 years, the Office for National Statistics said
today. The pound fell against the dollar. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average snapped three days of gains.  
 “The U.K. is still, from an economic perspective, more on
the bearish side and there is a reason for caution going
forward,” said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London. Gilts “have outperformed.”  
 The 10-year yield fell five basis points to 3.33 percent as
of 4:17 p.m. in London, after ending last week at 3.35 percent.
The 4.75 percent security maturing in March 2020 gained 0.39, or
3.9 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,510) face amount, to 111.68. The
yield spread to bunds narrowed four basis to 70 basis points
today, the least since Feb. 3.  
 The two-year note yield fell four basis points to 0.73
percent.  
 Sterling dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5096 and was little
changed at 83.69 pence per euro.  
 Deutsche Bank last week cut its 10-year gilt yield forecast
for the year end to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent and pushed
back the date when it predicts the Bank of England will raise
borrowing costs to February from November, Kumar said.  
 Yield Slides  
 The 10-year gilt  yield slid  51 basis points in the second
quarter as concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis may slow
global growth boosted appetite for fixed-income assets and Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s efforts to control Britain’s budget
deficit enhanced demand. The securities are outperforming German
bunds amid speculation Britain’s economic recovery may sputter
in the third quarter.  
 The cost of goods at factory gates fell 0.3 percent in June
from the previous month, compared a median estimate for a 0.1
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists.  
 “The U.K. economy does face headwinds,” the London-based
National Institute of Economic and Social Research said
yesterday. It estimated gross domestic product rose 0.7 percent
in the second quarter compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the
first. “Fiscal consolidation both in the U.K. and the euro area
will restrict growth in the short term and there is clearly a
risk that this rate of growth will not be maintained through the
rest of this year.”  
 Syndicated Sale  
 The U.K. plans to sell an undisclosed amount of 0.625
percent inflation-linked 2040 gilts in the second half of July
through banks, market conditions permitting, the nation’s debt
management office said in a statement.  
 The agency said yesterday it had hired Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc for the sale.  
 U.K. bonds returned 6.1 percent so far this year, compared
with a 6.7 percent profit from German bonds, while U.S.
Treasuries handed investors 5.7 percent, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts’ Societies.
