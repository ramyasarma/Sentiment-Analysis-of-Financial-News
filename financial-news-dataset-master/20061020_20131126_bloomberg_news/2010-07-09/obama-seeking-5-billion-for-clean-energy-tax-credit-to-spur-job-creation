             President  Barack Obama  called on
Congress today to add $5 billion for expansion of a clean-energy
manufacturing  tax credit  to encourage job creation.  
 “If an American company wants to create jobs and grow, we
should be there to help them do it,” Obama said at the
University of Nevada in Las Vegas, where he traveled to help
Senate Democratic Leader  Harry Reid  raise about $800,000 for his
November re-election campaign.  
 The president promoted his $862 billion stimulus package
and a section that last year provided $2.3 billion in tax
credits. That resulted in 183 projects that created more than
17,000 jobs making things such as wind turbines and solar
panels, Obama said in January.  
 The president today said the U.S. economy is recovering
from the worst recession since the 1930s, with 83,000 private
jobs added in June, though the  unemployment  rate is at 9.5
percent. In Nevada, the jobless rate was 14 percent in May.  
 “Nevada, I know we’ve been through tough times, and not
all the difficult days are behind us,” he said. “But I can
promise you this: We are headed in the right direction.”  
 Amonix Inc., a closely held company based in Seal Beach,
California, was cited by the president as one of the firms using
the tax credit to open solar-panel factories in Nevada and
Arizona.  
 Generating Jobs  
 A $5 billion expansion for energy tax credits of 30 percent
would attract about $12 billion in private investments, yielding
thousands of clean-energy manufacturing jobs. That would mean
that each federal dollar spent would lure about $2.40 in private
capital for such projects, according to a White House fact
sheet.  
 Obama said that the $5 billion investment would generate
almost 40,000 jobs and the $12 billion in private capital would
add another 90,000 jobs.  
 The program is being considered in Congress as part of a
pending energy-tax bill now in the Senate.  
 Obama was ending a two-day trip to Nevada and Missouri to
promote his policies to encourage development of clean-energy
technology before returning to Washington later today.  
 He said yesterday he expects energy investments alone to
generate 700,000 jobs over the next few years nationwide.
