             Toll Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
largest trucking company, agreed to buy WT Sea Air Group and
Genesis Forwarding Group for about A$150 million ($132 million),
to expand its freight operations in the U.K.  
 The two freight forwarding businesses will add about A$250
million in annual revenue and increase earnings per share in the
first year of ownership, Melbourne-based Toll said in a stock
exchange filing today. Freight-forwarding involves transporting
goods along with related activities such as customs clearance,
warehousing and ground services.  
 The company, which was founded in 1888 as a coal-hauling
horse-and-cart business, has spent more than $6 billion on
 acquisitions  in the past decade. Chief Executive Officer  Paul Little  is targeting A$3 billion in revenue from freight
forwarding by 2012, triple Toll’s 2009 sales from the business.  
 Acquiring WT and Genesis will place Toll’s freight
forwarding unit among the top six companies in the U.K. market,
Toll said. It will pay for the purchases with cash.  
 Toll  shares  rose 0.7 percent to A$5.90 at 10:22 a.m. in
Sydney, paring this year’s decline to about 32 percent. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2 percent.  
 The company also said it completed the sale of its 50
percent stake in the Singapore-based Pacorini Toll venture to
the Pacorini Group for an unspecified amount.
