             Related Cos., a New York real estate
company, was sued by Hypo Real Estate Capital Corp., which is
seeking to recover more than $194 million tied to a loan for a
ski resort project in Colorado.  
 Related owes the money under a guaranty agreement after an
affiliate defaulted on a $520.4 million loan to the project in
Snowmass Village, Colorado, Hypo said in its complaint filed
today in New York State Supreme Court.  
 The Related affiliate defaulted on the loan and owes $386
million in principal, Hypo said. Hypo is seeking $194.7 million
plus interest and expenses, according to the complaint.  
 Joanna Rose , a spokeswoman for Related, didn’t return a
phone call seeking comment after normal business hours.
Related’s portfolio of real estate assets is valued at more than
$15 billion, according to its website.  
 The case is Hypo Real Estate Capital Corp. v. Related Cos.,
650871-2010, New York State Supreme Court (New York).
