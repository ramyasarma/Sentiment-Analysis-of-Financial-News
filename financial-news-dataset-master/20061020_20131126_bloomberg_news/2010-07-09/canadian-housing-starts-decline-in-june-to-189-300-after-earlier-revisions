             Canadian housing starts were lower
than expected in June as multiple-dwelling projects declined,
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.  reported.   
 Starts dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of
189,300 units in June from a revised 195,300 units in May and
205,900 units in April.  Economists anticipated  the June pace of
starts would be 190,300 units, according to the median of 22
responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Housing starts decreased “largely due to the multiple
starts segment in Ontario,”  Bob Dugan , CMHC’s chief economist,
said in a statement. “After a robust start to 2010, we expect
the pace of housing start activity to moderate and total 182,000
units by year-end.”  
 Low  borrowing costs  and a tax increase that took effect
July 1 in Ontario and British Columbia sparked demand for
Canadian homes, helping the country’s economy recover from its
first recession in 17 years. The Bank of Canada predicted in
April that housing will contribute 0.6 percentage point to
growth this year and cut 0.1 point from next year’s expansion.  
 “Canadian residential construction activity has likely
peaked for the time being, and should soften further given the
weakening demand backdrop and lower rate of household
formation,”  Robert Kavcic , an economist with BMO Capital
Markets, said in a note to clients.  
 Urban multiple starts fell 5.8 percent to 89,200 units,
while single-family starts gained 1.4 percent to 77,800 units.
Starts in Ontario, Canada’s largest province, fell 17 percent to
52,600 units, CMHC also said.
