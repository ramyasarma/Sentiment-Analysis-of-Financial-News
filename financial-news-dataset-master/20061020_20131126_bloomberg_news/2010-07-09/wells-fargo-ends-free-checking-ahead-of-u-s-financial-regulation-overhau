             Wells Fargo & Co. , the U.S. bank with
the largest branch network, eliminated free checking accounts
for new customers as firms prepare for stricter consumer-
protection measures.  
 New basic checking accounts carry a $5 monthly fee as of
July 1, said  Julia Tunis Bernard , a spokeswoman for the San
Francisco-based bank. Wells Fargo also established minimum
deposit requirements for waiving the fee, she said.  
 “We’re no longer offering free checking as a new product
or new account,” Bernard said in an interview yesterday. In
addition to evaluating best practices, the lender considers
“industry trends and changes in the economic and regulatory
environment,” she said.  
 Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf  joins other banks in
replacing lost fee revenue as Congress nears creation of a
consumer protection agency and the Federal Reserve implements
rules restricting overdraft fees.  Bank of America Corp. , the
largest U.S. bank by assets and deposits, is developing a tiered
structure of charging for checking accounts, the Wall Street
Journal reported last month.  
 New regulations may cut as much as 15 percent of the
revenue that banks get from checking accounts, more than half of
which are already unprofitable, according to Celent, a Boston-
based research firm. Lenders traditionally cover the cost of
free checking with overdraft or automated teller machine fees.  
 “Overdraft fees are big money to most retail banking
operations,” Celent analyst  Bart Narter  said in the May report.
“It is the engine that pulls along free checking.”  
 Avoiding the Fee  
 To avoid the monthly fee, new Wells Fargo customers will
have to maintain a $1,500 minimum average balance or receive a
direct deposit of at least $250, Bernard said. The new rules,
posted on the  company’s website , don’t affect existing
customers.  
 Wells Fargo  had offered free checking in every state except
California, Bernard said. It made up a small percentage of new
account volume because most customers bundle checking with other
services, she said. Basic checking accounts in California had
required a minimum balance of $1,000 or a $100 monthly direct
deposit.  
 The financial-reform bill was passed by the House of
Representatives last month and awaits Senate approval before
being sent to President  Barack Obama .  
 The lender reported $1.3 billion in service charges on
deposit accounts in the first quarter, down 4 percent from the
same period last year, according to an April 21 statement.
Consumer checking accounts grew 7 percent in the period ended
March from a year earlier.  
 Wells Fargo has 6,600 retail branches and 2,200 mortgage
offices, the most of any U.S. bank, according to a July 7
statement. The new rules won’t apply to Wachovia Corp. branch
offices until the branches are converted to Wells Fargo, Bernard
said. Wells Fargo bought Wachovia for $12.7 billion in 2008 and
has said the merger will be finished by next year.
