             Carlyle Group has sold four-fifths of
1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of leveraged loans it put up
for sale in June, according to three people familiar with the
situation.  
 The world’s second-largest private-equity firm has found
buyers for about 1.2 billion euros of the debt it advertised to
dealers in a so-called bid list last month, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is private.  
 Carlyle has until September to sell the remaining debt, two
of the people said. Proceeds will be used to pay back the equity
holders of the fund, according to the people. The list includes
actively-traded loans issued by Irish phone company ERC Ireland
Holdings Ltd. and U.K. pay-television company Virgin Media Inc.  
 A London-based spokeswoman for Carlyle wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  
 The average bid prices for actively-traded leveraged loans
in Europe fell 4 basis points for the week to 93.27 percent of
face value, down 3.2 percent since the start of the year,
according to Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data.  
 Leveraged loans are used by private-equity firms to fund
buyouts. The money is raised in the name of the target company
and repaid with its cash flows, causing the target’s credit
quality to fall to junk, or below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB- by S&P.
