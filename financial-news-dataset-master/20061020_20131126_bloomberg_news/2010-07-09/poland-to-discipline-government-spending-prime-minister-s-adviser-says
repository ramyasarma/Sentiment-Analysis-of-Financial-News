             Poland’s government will be taking
steps to “more clearly discipline” public spending over the
next two months, as the government prepares a draft 2011 budget,
Michal Boni, the chief adviser to Prime Minister Donald Tusk,
said today in an interview on TVN CNBC television.  
 Besides a proposed cap on annual spending growth at no more
than 1 percent after inflation, Boni said the government would
freeze wages for many public-sector employees next year, with
the exception of certain occupations such as teachers.
