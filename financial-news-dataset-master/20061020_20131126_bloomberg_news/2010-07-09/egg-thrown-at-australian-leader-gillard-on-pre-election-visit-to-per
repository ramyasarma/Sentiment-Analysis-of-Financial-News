             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  avoided an egg thrown at her during her first visit to
the Western Australian capital of Perth as national leader.  
 Gillard, who ousted predecessor  Kevin Rudd  on June 24, was
arriving for an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
when the egg flew by. Police will charge a 55-year-old man over
the incident, the Australian newspaper reported on its website.  
 “I did see something flying past and I’ve met the lady
coming in who ended up with the egg on the back of her
raincoat,” she told ABC radio in Perth. “I did apologize to
her because I don’t think someone was throwing an egg at her.”  
 Some miners are unhappy with Gillard’s revised mining tax
announced on July 2. The 30 percent profits tax on coal and iron
ore earnings struck a nerve in Western Australia, which accounts
for 62 percent of the nation’s mineral production.  
 “I don’t know what they were frustrated about,” Gillard
said. “If people have got something to say to me, what I would
obviously prefer is that I’m always up for a frank
conversation.”  
 The first Nielsen opinion poll on Gillard gave her a 10
percentage point lead over  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal-National
coalition, at 55 percent to 45 percent, according to the
telephone survey of 1,000 voters published June 26 in the Sydney
Morning Herald. That poll also gave her a 21-point advantage
over Abbott, 52, as preferred prime minister.  
 Gillard has said an election will be held in the second
half of the year, although she has not yet set a date.
