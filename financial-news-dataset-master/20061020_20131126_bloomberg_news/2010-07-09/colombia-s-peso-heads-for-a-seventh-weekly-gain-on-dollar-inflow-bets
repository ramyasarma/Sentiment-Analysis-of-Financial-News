             Colombia’s peso posted its seventh
straight week of gains, the longest winning streak since
October, on speculation increased foreign investment will boost
dollar inflows into the South American nation.  
 The peso climbed 0.8 percent this week to 1,873.55 per U.S.
dollar at 4:04 p.m. New York time, from 1,888.60 on July 2. The
currency strengthened during seven straight weeks in the period
ended Oct. 16, 2009. The peso has jumped 9.1 percent this year,
the best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
It gained 0.6 percent today.  
 “Flows are coming in and the expectation is that they’ll
continue to do so, not only in terms of foreign direct
investment, but also portfolio investment,” said Guillermo
Puentes, head trader at Banco de Comercio Exterior de Colombia
SA, known as Bancoldex.  
 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which rates Colombia
BB+, or one level below investment grade, this week raised its
outlook on the country’s credit rating to positive from stable.
The move follows comments from  Alessandra Alecci , an analyst
with Moody’s Investors Service, who said in a June 30 interview
that the agency is “optimistic” on Colombia and that there is
“potential” for the South American country to move toward
investment grade.  
 Speculation an upgrade would lure more foreign investors to
the country’s financial assets also helped push gains in
Colombian bonds this week.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell eight basis points this week to 7.67 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The yield rose one basis
point today and the bond’s price fell 0.082 centavo to 122.726
centavos per peso.  
 Colombia will attract about $10 billion in foreign direct
investment this year, Trade Minister  Luis Guillermo Plata  has
said. The nation received $7.2 billion of foreign direct
investment in 2009, after a record $10.6 billion the previous
year, according to the central bank.
