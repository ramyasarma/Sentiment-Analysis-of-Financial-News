             AccessKenya Group Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded Internet company, rose for the first day in five
after it named  Daniel Ndonye  as its chairman.  
 The stock advanced as much as 2.4 percent to 21.75
shillings and traded 1.2 percent higher at 21.50 shillings as of
11:02 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level would be the first
gain since July 5.  
 Ndonye replaces  Michael Somen , who resigned after the board
decided “that the chairman shall be an independent non-
executive director,” the company said in a statement on its
website today. The former chairman is the father of Managing
Director  Jonathan Somen  and has headed the board since the
company’s inception 10 years ago.  
 “The appointment of somebody as respected as Daniel Ndonye
shows they are addressing issues about the composition of the
board,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , a Nairobi-based independent stock
market analyst, said in a phone interview. “They are
transforming from a family-owned business into a properly
constituted listed company.”
