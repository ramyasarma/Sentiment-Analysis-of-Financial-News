             Two HSBC Holdings Plc employees are 
at the heart of an investigation into the leak of Swiss 
confidential client data that landed up in the hands of the 
French tax authorities, the Wall Street Journal reported, 
citing people familiar with the matter.  
 Herve Falciani and Georgina Mikhael both deny doing 
anything illegal; Falciani admitted having possession of copies
of thousands of wealthy clients of HSBC’s Swiss private banking
arm, but said neither he nor Mikhael asked for money when they 
contacted French, German and British authorities over the list,
the newspaper said.  
 Falciani told the Journal “I am not a Robin Hood, I’m not 
a mercenary. I acted like a citizen.”  
 French tax authorities said they hadn’t paid for the data 
and it ended up in their hands after police raided Falciani’s 
home in the south of France at the request of the Swiss; copies
were sent to Switzerland but French tax authorities are now 
investigating those people whose names appear on it, the WSJ 
reported.  
 Both are being investigated by the Swiss over breaking 
banking secrecy laws, which they deny, the Journal said.
