             Treasury  10-year notes  were poised
for the biggest weekly decline since April as concern eased that
the U.S. is slipping back into recession and the government
prepared to sell $69 billion of notes and bonds.  
 The benchmark 10-year  yield  touched the highest level in
almost two weeks after rising yesterday above 3 percent for the
first time this month as stocks rallied on evidence of a global
economic recovery. The U.S. is set to auction $35 billion of
three-year notes on July 12, $21 billion of 10-year debt the
following day and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 14.  
 “Some of the data this week, with the better performance
of the equity market and some of the fear being relinquished on
the economy side, is all it is,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading in New York at Bank of Nova Scotia. “People
are lightening up positions on the long end.”  
 The 10-year note yield increased 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.04 percent at 11:35 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The yield touched 3.06
percent, the highest level since June 28. The price of the 3.5
percent security due in May 2020 fell 3/32, or $94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 103 7/8.  
 The  yield  has climbed 6 basis points this week, the most
since the five days ended April 2. It dropped to 2.8793 percent
on July 1, the lowest level since April 2009. The  two-year yield 
increased 1 basis point to 0.63 percent today and was little
changed for the week.  
 ‘Knife’s Edge’  
 “We’re on knife’s edge,” said  Christian Cooper , senior
rates trader in New York at Jefferies & Co., one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “There’s a
little bit of optimism, but we could go back to a concern about
a double-dip if we have consistent misses on earnings or a
surprise out of Europe. Supply is starting to impact the price
dynamic.”  
 Treasuries  slipped as Commerce Department data showed
inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose in May for a fifth month,
increasing 0.5 percent as companies ensured they had enough
goods on hand to keep pace with demand. The Labor Department
said yesterday initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S.
fell more than expected to 454,000 in the week ended July 3.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was poised for a 4.8
percent rally this week.  
 10-Year Yields  
 Investors should sell 10-year Treasuries, as yields “will
climb back towards 3.25 percent,” strategists at Citigroup Inc.
led by  Amitabh Arora  in New York wrote in a note to clients
today. The firm recommends buying five-year notes.  
 Ten-year yields will increase to 3.37 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
banks and securities companies, with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weightings.  
 “While the longer end has traded weaker the last two days
on equity strength, there has been no reversal yet of the new
consensus for the Fed on hold into 2011,”  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee,
wrote in a note to clients.  
 Traders reduced bets the Federal Reserve will raise
borrowing costs by their December meeting, according to futures
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Expectations fell to a 14 percent
chance, from 29 percent a month ago.  
 The International Monetary Fund on July 7 raised its
forecast for worldwide growth this year to 4.6 percent, the most
since 2007, versus an April projection of 4.2 percent.  
 Double-Dip Unlikely  
 The world isn’t likely to experience a double-dip
recession,  Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard University professor and
former chief economist of the IMF, said in Singapore today. The
Fed may keep rates steady for a “very long time,” he told
reporters after a conference.  
 Traders added the most to inflation bets in six weeks
yesterday. The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices, widened by 8 basis points to 1.81
percentage points in the biggest increase since May 27. The gap
on July 7 touched 1.68 percentage points, a nine-month low. It
increased to 1.84 percentage points today.  
 The Fed cited slowing inflation in its June 23 statement
while reaffirming it foresees a “moderate” pace of growth.  
 Treasuries returned 5.9 percent in the first six months of
2010, the most since 1995, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Investors snapped up government debt on
speculation efforts by European governments to cut spending
would slow global economic growth.
