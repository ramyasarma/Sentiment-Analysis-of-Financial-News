             Mexico’s peso had the biggest weekly
gain since January as inflation fell within the central bank’s
target range in June for a second time this year.  
 The currency gained 2.5 percent to 12.7693 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 13.0828 on July 2. The peso was little
changed today. The currency gained 3.2 percent in the week
ending Jan. 8.  
 “The fact that you are getting growth without inflation is
excellent,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a currency strategist
with RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. “The worst
thing would have been for Banxico to have to lift rates before
the U.S.”  
 Consumer prices rose 3.69 percent in June from a year
earlier, within the central bank’s target range of 2 percent to
4 percent. Mexican Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said
yesterday the government will raise its forecast for growth this
year from its current estimate.  
 The yield on the 10 percent benchmark bond due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 7.09 percent
today, according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the
security fell 0.55 centavos to 126.25 centavos on the peso.  
 The central bank will keep interest rates unchanged until
March 2011, according to the median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit. The central bank kept
the benchmark interest rate at a record low 4.5 percent in June.
