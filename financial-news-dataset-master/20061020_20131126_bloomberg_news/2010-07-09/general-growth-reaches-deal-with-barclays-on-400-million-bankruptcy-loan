             General Growth Properties Inc. , the
second largest mall operator in the U.S., said it has an
agreement for a new $400 million bankruptcy loan from  Barclays
Plc .  
 General Growth is seeking court permission to use the new
financing to replace its existing $400 million bankruptcy loan,
it said yesterday in papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan.  
 The mall owner said it will save $2.7 million per month in
interest payments under the new agreement, “thereby preserving
value in General Growth that would otherwise be lost,” if it
didn’t repay the original loan.  
 General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy
last year after amassing a $27 billion debt load making
acquisitions. It has said it expects to file its plan to
restructure its remaining debt this week.  
 The new financing comes with a 5.5 percent interest rate
compared with a variable interest rate under the existing loan,
which is currently at 13.5 percent, the lowest rate
possible, General Growth said.  
 The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
