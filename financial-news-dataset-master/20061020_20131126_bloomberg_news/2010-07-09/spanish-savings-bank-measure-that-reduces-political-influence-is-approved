             Spain’s Cabinet approved changes to
rules governing savings banks in a bid to reduce the influence
of regional politicians on their management.  
 The new decree law limits the voting rights that regional
administrations and public entities can exercise in the lenders’
management bodies to 40 percent from a previous 50 percent, the
 Finance Ministry  said today in a statement.  
 Elected politicians won’t be able to serve in the lenders’
management, even as regional parliaments will choose officials
to represent them in the savings banks, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  told a news conference after a weekly Cabinet meeting.  
 Spain’s government has encouraged almost 40 savings banks
to merge after a surge in loan defaults at the institutions that
are linked to regional administrations and account for about
half the country’s lending. As Spain prepares to publish stress
tests on lenders, the new legislation aims to make cajas more
professional while allowing them to raise capital by selling
shares.  
 Still, some regional administrations wield more clout in
the savings banks than their voting rights alone would indicate.
In Caja Madrid, the appointment of Rodrigo Rato as chairman last
year was decided by members of the Popular Party that governs in
the region, even as municipal corporations and the Madrid
parliament named only 140 of 320 members in the management body
that controls the bank.  
 ‘Favorable’ Law  
 The association of savings banks, the CECA, said it
considered the outline of the new law “favorable” as it
includes some of the lenders’ proposals.  
 As part of the overhaul, the cajas will be able to sell
shares known as “cuotas participativas” with voting rights
that give an investor as much as 50 percent control. Salgado
said she expects those shares to be “attractive,” allowing the
lenders to raise capital.  
 A series of mergers backed by 11.2 billion euros ($14.2
billion) of loans from the government’s bank-rescue fund known
as the FROB has reduced the number of savings banks to 19 from
an initial 45, Salgado said.  
 “The restructuring itself has contributed to solvency,”
Salgado said. “We will see that with the stress tests.”
