             Spain had the most nominations for
the Golden Ball award for the World Cup’s best player, while
fellow finalist the Netherlands provided two players on soccer
governing body FIFA’s shortlist.  
 Spain midfielders  Xavi Hernandez  and  Andres Iniesta , and
forward  David Villa , were among the 10 nominees put forward by
FIFA’s Technical Study Group. Accredited members of the media
will vote to determine the winner, which will be announced after
the July 11 final, FIFA said.  
 Wesley Sneijder , who is tied on a tournament-leading five
goals with Villa going into the final, was included on the list
with Dutch teammate Arjen Robben . Germany, which lost to Spain
in the semifinals, is represented by  Mesut Oezil  and  Bastian Schweinsteiger .  
 Germany’s Thomas Mueller was shortlisted for the
tournament’s best young player award alongside Mexico’s  Giovani Dos Santos  and Andre Ayew of Ghana. That accolade is open to
players born on or after Jan. 1, 1989, FIFA said.
