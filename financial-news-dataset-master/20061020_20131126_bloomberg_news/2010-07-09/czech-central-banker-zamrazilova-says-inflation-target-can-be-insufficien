             Central banks should use more
“expert discretion” in setting interest rates as inflation
targeting alone won’t stop asset bubbles, Czech policy maker  Eva Zamrazilova  said in a commentary printed by  Hospodarske Noviny .  
 Consumer inflation indexes used by most central banks as a
basis for their policy decisions do not account for asset
prices, Zamrazilova wrote in the Prague-based newspaper today.  
 “On the back of today’s extremely low interest levels, a
germ of a new problem is probably being born somewhere,”
Zamrazilova wrote in the opinion piece.
