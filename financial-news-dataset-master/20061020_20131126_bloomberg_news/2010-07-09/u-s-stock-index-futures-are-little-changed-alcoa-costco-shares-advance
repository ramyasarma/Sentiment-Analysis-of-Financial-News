             U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  to the biggest weekly gain in a
year, amid optimism about earnings reports and a rally in metals
that drove up shares of its producers.  
 Alcoa Inc. , the first Dow Jones Industrial Average company
to post second-quarter results July 12, rose 2.1 percent.  Bank
of America Corp.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co., which also report
quarterly numbers next week, jumped more than 1.6 percent.
 Google Inc.  rallied 2.4 percent as China renewed its Internet
license, while rival Baidu Inc. slid 1.7 percent.  
 The  S&P 500  rose 0.7 percent to 1,077.96 at 4 p.m. in New
York, giving it a 5.4 percent rally in a week shortened by
Monday’s Independence Day holiday. The  Dow  gained 59.04 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 10,198.03. Both gauges had the biggest weekly
rally since July 17. Fewer than 6.7 billion shares traded on
U.S. exchanges today, the lowest volume of the year.  
 “Stocks have more room to go,” said E.  William Stone , who
oversees $104 billion as chief investment strategist at  PNC
Wealth Management  in Philadelphia. “We took the elevator to the
ground floor. Hopefully, we can ride this back up with some
brighter news on the earnings front. While there are questions
about a slowdown and corporate outlooks, we believe we’re not in
a double dip.”  
 Stocks advanced after a 16 percent retreat on the  S&P 500 
between April 23, which it reached a 19-month high, and July 2.
The rally this week was spurred by higher-than-forecast sales at
some retailers and a drop in jobless claims.  
 Slowest Pace  
 Profits for S&P 500 companies are projected to have
increased 34 percent in the April-June period and by the same
amount in 2010, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Corporate profits may grow 25 percent in the third
quarter, the slowest pace of the year. Per-share earnings rose
52 percent from January through March.  
 “Investors are in a wait-and-see mode,” said  John Praveen , the Newark, New Jersey-based chief investment
strategist at  Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC ,
which oversees $693 billion. “People are looking for data to
show that we’re not having a double dip. Second-quarter earnings
will come in much higher than expected. However, investors are
looking for corporate outlooks. Investors are trying to gauge if
the recent rally is for real.”  
 Alcoa  
 Alcoa may announce earnings of 11 cents a share, according
to the  average analyst estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. That
compares with a loss of 26 cents in the same period a year ago.  
 The largest U.S. aluminum producer rose 2.1 percent to
$10.94, helping to lead  raw-materials  companies to the biggest
gain among 10 S&P 500 industries. Gold rose the most in three
weeks on speculation that the lowest prices since May will
revive demand. Copper, silver also rallied.  
 Newmont Mining Corp. , the largest U.S. gold producer,
climbed 2.6 percent to $61.93. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc., the largest publicly traded copper producer, jumped 4.5
percent to $65.98.  
 Monsanto Co. , the world’s largest seed company, had the
biggest gain in the S&P 500, rising 7.3 percent to $51.21.  
 Financial stocks had the second-biggest gain in the S&P 500
among 10 industries, rising 1.6 percent.  
 Trading of bullish options on U.S. banks and brokers rose
to a two-month high before three of the five biggest financial
companies report results next week.  
 Financial ETF  
 More than 287,000 calls to buy the  Financial Select Sector
SPDR Fund , an exchange-traded fund tracking 79 firms, changed
hands, triple the four-week average and double the number of
puts to sell. The ETF climbed 1.4 percent to $14.51, its highest
close since June 25. The ETF’s  most-active options  were July $15
calls, which doubled to 9 cents and accounted for more than half
of call volume.  
 JPMorgan Chase , which reports results July 15, rose 1.8
percent to $38.85. Bank of America gained 1.7 percent to $15.11,
while Citigroup Inc. advanced 1.8 percent to $4.04. Both report
second-quarter results on July 16. Profits at S&P 500 financial
firms are estimated to increase 81 percent in the three-month
period ending June 30 from a year earlier, according to
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Google climbed 2.4 percent to $467.49. The owner of the
world’s largest Web search engine said the Chinese government
renewed its Internet license, after the company submitted a
revised application to meet regulations in the world’s biggest
market by users.  
 Rival Baidu slid 1.7 percent to $71.20.  
 Visa, RIM  
 Visa Inc.  gained 3.1 percent to $77.38. The world’s biggest
payments network was added to the “Americas Conviction Buy”
list at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 Research In Motion Ltd.  surged 7.8 percent to $53.33. The
maker of the BlackBerry smartphone plans to start an
applications store and consumer Internet services in China,
according to Reuters.  
 The benchmark index for U.S. stock options fell for a sixth
day, the longest losing streak since March. The  VIX , as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known,
dropped 2.8 percent to 24.98. The index, which measures the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500,
is down from this year’s closing high of 45.79 on May 20.
