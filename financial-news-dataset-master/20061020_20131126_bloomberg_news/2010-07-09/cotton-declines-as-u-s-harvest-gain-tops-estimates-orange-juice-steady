             Cotton rose for the second time in
three days on signs of increased overseas demand for fiber from
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Orange-juice futures
declined.  
 Cotton shipments will total 14.3 million bales in the
marketing year beginning Aug. 1, up from 13.5 million forecast
last month, and a 17 percent jump from the current year, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a  report . Unsold supplies
on July 31, 2011, were estimated at 3.5 million bales, up
700,000 bales from the month-ago projection, while the crop
estimate was raised 9.6 percent to 18.3 million bales.  
 “Despite the jump in U.S. yields, ending stocks are only
up 700,000 bales,” said  Ron Lawson , a managing director at
Logic Advisors, a commodities advisory group in Sonoma,
California. “Supplies are going to remain tight.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 1 cent, or 1.4 percent,
to 74.99 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
most-active contract fell 0.7 percent last week, paring this
year’s gain to 23 percent.  
 Global consumption will total 119.7 million bales, up from
119.5 million forecast last month, and outpacing worldwide
production of 116 million bales, the USDA said in today’s
report. The world stocks-to-use ratio is the smallest since
1995, the department said. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  
 In another ICE market, orange-juice futures for September
delivery fell 0.05 cent to $1.3755, dropping for a fourth
straight day. The commodity has surged 54 percent in the last
year on forecasts for a smaller Florida crop. The U.S. is the
second-biggest producer behind Brazil.
