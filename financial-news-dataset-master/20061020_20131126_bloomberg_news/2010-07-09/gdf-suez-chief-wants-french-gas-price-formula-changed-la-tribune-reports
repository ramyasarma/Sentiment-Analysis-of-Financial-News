             GDF Suez SA wants to change the
method for calculating French gas prices after Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde said that rates should be frozen for six
months after an increase programmed for July, La Tribune said.  
 The newspaper cited GDF Suez Chief Executive Officer Gerard
Mestrallet. He wants the determination of prices to be free of
political considerations and is ready to pass on any cost
reductions that he can negotiate with suppliers to customers, La
Tribune reported.
