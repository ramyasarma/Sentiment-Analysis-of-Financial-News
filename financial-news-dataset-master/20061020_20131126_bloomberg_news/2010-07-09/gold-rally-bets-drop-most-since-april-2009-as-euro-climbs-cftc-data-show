             Bets on a gold rally by hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators dropped the most since
April 2009 after the metal traded below a key moving average
following the euro’s rebound.  
 In the week ended July 6, speculative long positions, or
 bets  prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 209,042
contracts on the Comex in New York, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed today. Net-long positions fell by
35,683 futures contracts, or 15 percent, from a week earlier.  
 Gold prices fell 3.8 percent from June 29 to July 6 and
traded below the 50-day moving average in the three sessions
ended July 6. On July 1, the euro surged the most since March
2009 on speculation that Europe’s banking industry may be in
better shape that investors estimated, driving down the precious
metal.  
 “It’s not surprising to see a big dent in net longs after
the technical damage was done,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at
LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “A lot of traders use the 50-
day moving average. If it breaks under, you’re out.”  
 Today, gold futures for August delivery rose $13.70, or 1.1
percent, to $1,209.80 an ounce, marking the biggest gain in
three weeks.  
 Net-longs rose to a record 262,331 contracts in November.
Gold futures climbed to an all-time high of $1,266.50 on June
21.  
 Each Friday, the CFTC publishes aggregate numbers for long
and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors. Analysts and investors follow changes
in speculators’ positions because such transactions can reflect
an expectation of a change in prices.
