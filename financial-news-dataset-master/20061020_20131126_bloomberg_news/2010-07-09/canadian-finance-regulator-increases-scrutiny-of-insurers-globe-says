             Canada’s financial-services regulator
is conducting stress tests on the country’s life insurers to see
if they can withstand a major pandemic or stock market crash,
the Globe and Mail reported, citing unidentified people.  
 The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
asked 20 life insurers to run mathematical models of how three
scenarios could affect their businesses, the newspaper said.  
 If tests determine that insurers such as  Manulife Financial
Corp.  and  Sun Life Financial Inc.  would be “seriously harmed”
by such events, the regulator could tell the companies to hold
more capital, the Globe said.
