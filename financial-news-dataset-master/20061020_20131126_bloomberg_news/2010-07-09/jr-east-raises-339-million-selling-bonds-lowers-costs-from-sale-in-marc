             East Japan Railway Co. , the nation’s
largest train operator by sales, sold 30 billion yen ($338
million) of bonds to repay maturing debt, cutting funding costs
from four months ago.  
 The operator priced 15 billion yen of five-year 0.446
percent bonds to yield 8 basis points more than similar-maturity
Japanese government bonds, and another 15 billion yen of 10-year,
1.222 percent notes at a 7 basis-point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company made a filing with Japan’s
Finance Ministry today to sell the bonds.  
 Investors are buying top-rated corporate debt in Japan amid
concerns over a possible double-dip recession. The extra yield
investors demand to own corporate bonds rated AA instead of
government debt averaged 25 basis points yesterday, down from 27
on June 29, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch AA Rated Japan
Corporate Index shows.  
 JR East,  rated  Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
second-highest investment grade, lowered its funding cost from
March when the Tokyo-based operator set the spread at 8 basis
points for its 10-year 1.394 percent bonds, Bloomberg data show.  
 Mizuho Securities Co. and Nomura Securities Co. are helping
the operator sell the debt, the data show.
