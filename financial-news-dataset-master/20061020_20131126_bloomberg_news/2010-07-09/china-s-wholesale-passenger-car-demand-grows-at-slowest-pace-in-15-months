             China’s passenger-car sales to
dealerships rose at the slowest pace in 15 months in June as
inflation reduced consumers’ purchasing power and economic
growth showed signs of cooling.  
 Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles in the world’s largest auto market rose 19 percent from
a year earlier to 1.04 million last month, the  China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers  said in an e-mailed statement today.
It was the smallest increase since March 2009.  
 Auto dealers’ inventories rose after  inflation  quickened in
May to an annual 3.1 percent rate, the fastest in 19 months,
reducing buyers’ spending power. Data next week may show
consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in June from a year earlier,
and the government may report that gross domestic product
increased at a reduced pace in the second quarter, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “It’s unavoidable vehicle sales growth will slow in the
second half,” said  Olive Xia , a Shanghai-based analyst at Core
Pacific Yamaichi.  
 China’s passenger-car sales have risen every month since
February 2009 after the government halved the consumption tax on
small vehicles to 5 percent the preceding month as part of an
economic stimulus package. Vehicle demand surged 46 percent to
13.6 million last year, surpassing the  U.S.  for the first time.  
 The small-car sales tax was raised to 7.5 percent this year,
and June was the third straight month of slowing demand. Monthly
sales may decline from year-earlier levels during the second
half of 2010, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts  Adrian Chan  and
 Hung Bin Toh  wrote in a report on May 26.  
 New Subsidies  
 Core Pacific’s Xia estimated auto sales in China may rise
20 percent this year, compared with an April forecast for 17
percent full-year growth by the State Information Center.  
 China’s government said June 30 it selected 71 models made
by 16 automakers to qualify for new subsidies of 3,000 yuan
($443) to encourage purchases of fuel-efficient vehicles. More
models will be approved later, according to the government.  
 “Hopefully the newly introduced subsidies for energy-
saving vehicles can be a new stimulation,” Xia said.  
 Passenger-car sales to consumers rose by 10.9 percent in
June from a year earlier to 839,228 units, the China Automotive
Technology & Research Center said on July 5.  
 Rising Stockpiles  
 General Motors Co., the biggest foreign automaker in China,
boosted sales in China by 23 percent in June, the smallest
increase since at least February 2009.  BYD Co. , the Shenzhen-
based carmaker backed by  Warren Buffett , increased sales to
dealers by 3.3 percent last month, according to the automaker
association.  
 Vehicle production outnumbered sales by 1.29 million units
in the first half, the China Automotive Technology & Research
Center said on July 5. The average stockpile period, a measure
of the time between car production and registration, was 55 days
in June, compared with 41 days in February, the center said.  
 Total passenger-car sales in the first half rose 48 percent
from a year earlier to 6.72 million, according to the automaker
association. Vehicle sales including buses and trucks increased
23 percent last month to 1.41 million, the association said.
They rose 48 percent in the first half of the year to 9.02
million.
