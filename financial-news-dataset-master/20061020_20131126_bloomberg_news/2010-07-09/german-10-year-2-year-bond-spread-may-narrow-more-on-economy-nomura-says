             The extra yield investors demand to
hold German 10-year bunds instead of two-year notes may narrow
to a 16-month low as reports signal the economy is improving
more quickly than anticipated, Nomura International Plc said.  
 The spread may tighten to about 170 basis points by the end
of July, the lowest level since March 23, 2009, Nomura
strategists led by  Nick Firoozye  said in an e-mailed note today.
The gap was little changed at 190 basis points as of 8:53 a.m.
in London. The spread has shrunk from a 13-year high of 237
basis points on May 11.  
 The market was “buffeted by a positive surprise” in
German industrial production growth for May, the note said.
Production rose 2.6 percent from a month earlier, a government
report showed yesterday. That beat the median estimate of a 0.9
gain from 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
