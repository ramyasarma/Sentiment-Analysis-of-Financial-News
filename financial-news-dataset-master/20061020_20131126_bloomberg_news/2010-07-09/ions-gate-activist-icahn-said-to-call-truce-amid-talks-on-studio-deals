             Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. 
reached a tentative truce with billionaire  Carl Icahn  that lets
the film and TV studio make a case for certain acquisitions.  
 Lions Gate agreed not to engage in any other negotiations
that might increase the amount of stock outstanding by more than
5 percent while the 10-day deal is in force, according to a
regulatory  filing  today. The issuance of new equity would dilute
Icahn’s near 38 percent stake.  
 The Vancouver-based studio, the producer of TV’s “Mad
Men” series, has held talks to buy  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. , a
person with knowledge of the situation said last month. The
company told Icahn of its interest in MGM last year. Under the
accord, all material, nonpublic information shared with Icahn,
74, will be released to the public by July 20.  
 The agreement suggests Lions Gate management, led by Chief
Executive Officer  Jon Feltheimer , has convinced Icahn to hear
the company’s arguments for film industry acquisitions. Dow
Jones Newswires reported the agreement earlier today.  
 The company has no plans for an acquisition that would
significantly increase its debt,  Peter Wilkes , a Lions Gate
spokesman, said in an e-mail after the filing. The company
reported total liabilities of $1.62 billion as of March 31,
including accounts payable and residuals.  
 The company and Icahn, locked in a fight for control of the
studio, will also end their public bickering, people with
knowledge of the situation said. They asked to remain anonymous
because the talks between the parties aren’t public. The two
sides may jointly extend the agreement, they said.  
 Icahn, Lions Gate’s largest shareholder, has criticized the
company’s spending on films and said last month he planned a
proxy fight to replace management and the board. The activist
investor’s $7-a-share takeover bid expired on June 30.  
 Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, gained 8
cents to $6.84 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
 trading . The stock has gained 18 percent this year.
