             Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.  may record an $800 million writedown tied to asset declines
in the second quarter, said  Meyer Shields , the Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. analyst who cut the stock to “sell” yesterday.  
 “Because of Berkshire’s derivatives portfolio, it’s sort
of a double-whammy,” he said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today. “When the economy weakens and the markets
trail down they have to take a mark-to-market hit on their
 balance sheet . Right now, we’re estimating a hit of $800 million
for the second quarter.”  
 Buffett has sold contracts protecting investors against
losses in four indexes, including the Standard & Poor’s 500. If
the benchmarks are at zero when the agreements expire, the
losses would be about $37 billion, according to the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company’s most recent quarterly report. The S&P
500  slumped  12 percent in the three months ended June 30, the
biggest drop since 2008.  
 Declines in stocks  Berkshire holds  could also weigh on the
company’s book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities,
Shields said in yesterday’s note. Berkshire held about $60.8
billion in stocks at the end of March.  Coca-Cola Co. ,
Berkshire’s top holding, fell 8.9 percent in the second quarter.
Wells Fargo & Co., the second-largest, dropped 18 percent.
Buffett’s firm slipped 1.5 percent in the three months.  
 “Even though we’ve seen the S&P and the broader markets
pull back on the recalibration of economic expectations, we
haven’t seen that impact Berkshire,” Shields said today. “That
disillusionment is waiting to weaken Berkshire shares.”  
 Berkshire climbed $800, or 0.7 percent, to $119,700 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Shields said yesterday the economic slump may also weigh on
results on Berkshire’s  operating units . The company owns a
railroad, jewelry merchants and providers of building supplies.
