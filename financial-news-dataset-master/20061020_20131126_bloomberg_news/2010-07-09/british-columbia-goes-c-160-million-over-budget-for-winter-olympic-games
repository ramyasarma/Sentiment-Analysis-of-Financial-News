             The  2010 Winter Olympics  cost British
Columbia taxpayers C$160 million ($155 million) more than the
Canadian province budgeted, the government said today in a
report.  
 Total spending of C$925 million included costs for
security, Olympic legacy projects and construction of
competition venues in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia,
the government said.  
 The tally compares with the estimate of C$765 million the
government of Premier Gordon Campbell previously said it would
contribute to the cost of hosting the Winter Games from Feb. 12-
28, the province said today.
