             Fiat SpA , Italy’s biggest
manufacturer, will proceed with a 700 million-euro ($875
million) investment to produce its Panda model at a domestic
plant, even though it drew opposition from a large union.  
 Chief Executive Office  Sergio Marchionne  clarified Fiat’s
plan for its Pomigliano factory near Naples, taking the unusual
step of writing a four-page letter to all of the Turin-based
company’s employees.  
 “I write to you as a man who has and still believes firmly
in the possibility of building together, in Italy, something
great, something better and long-lasting,” Marchionne said in
the letter distributed by Fiat via e-mail following a meeting
today with labor unions.  
 In a referendum last month about 60 percent of workers at
Pomigliano, Fiat’s least productive factory, supported the
company’s proposals to add shifts, shorten sick leave and reduce
strikes as part of a plan to transfer Panda production from
Poland.  
 Four out of five unions representing the 5,000 workers at
the site backed Fiat’s plan. Marchionne wanted support from all
five of the labor groups.  
 “The real objective of the project is to plug the gap in
competitiveness with other countries and bring Fiat to an
efficiency level that guarantees Italy a solid auto industry and
all of our workers a more secure future,” Marchionne wrote.  
 Fiat currently produces Alfa Romeo models at the Pomigliano
plant.
