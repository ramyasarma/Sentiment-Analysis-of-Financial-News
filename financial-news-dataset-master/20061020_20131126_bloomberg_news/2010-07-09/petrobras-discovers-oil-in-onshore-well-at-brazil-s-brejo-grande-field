             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found evidence of oil in an
onshore well in Brazil’s Brejo Grande field, the Brazilian
petroleum regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 3BRSA843DSE well in the
Sergipe basin, the National Petroleum Agency said on its
website. The company hasn’t determined if the find can be
developed commercially.  
 Separately, UTC Engenharia found evidence of gas at the
1UTC2RN onshore well in the Potiguar Basin’s BT-POT-10 block,
the regulator’s website said.
