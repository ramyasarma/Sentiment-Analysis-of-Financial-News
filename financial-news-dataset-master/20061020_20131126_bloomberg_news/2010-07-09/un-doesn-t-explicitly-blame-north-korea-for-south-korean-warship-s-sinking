             A  United Nations  Security Council
statement adopted today doesn’t explicitly blame North Korea for
the March sinking of a South Korean warship that killed 46
sailors.  
 “The  Security Council  condemns the attack which led to the
sinking of the Cheonan,” the unanimously adopted statement
says. It “takes note” of North Korea’s denial of involvement
in the March 26 incident.  
 A multinational investigation reported on June 14 that a
North Korean-made torpedo caused the sinking. The draft says
that, “in view of the findings” of the probe, the Security
Council “expresses its deep concern” about the finding of
North Korean complicity.  
 Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the UN, yesterday said
the statement was a “very clear and appropriate response.” She
said adoption of the statement would “send a unified message
that the Security Council condemns the attack.”  
 The statement also says the incident “endangers peace and
security in the region” and urges “appropriate and peaceful
measures to be taken against those responsible for the
incident.”  
 The permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain,
China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- agreed yesterday on the
text following more than a month of negotiations that also
included Japan and South Korea.
