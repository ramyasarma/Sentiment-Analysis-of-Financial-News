             Hedge funds and commodity trading
advisers bought Chicago corn contracts at the fastest pace since
September 2006 as prices surged last week, signaling concern
that excessive rain may limit U.S. production.  
 Speculators boosted net-long positions sixfold, to 79,749
futures and options contracts on July 6 from 13,045 a week
earlier, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said today.
Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have climbed 15 percent
since June 29 to the highest level in almost six months.  
 “That’s a major swing and reflects the growing concern
about this year’s crop,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing
adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,
Illinois. “We cannot lose any more bushels of corn.”  
 Parts of the Midwest received more than three times the
normal rain the past 30 days, threatening to limit supplies from
the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  
 Global inventories as a percentage of consumption will drop
to a four-year low on Sept. 30, 2011, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose as much as 0.4
percent today on the CBOT to $3.98 a bushel, the highest price
since Jan. 12, before closing at $3.9525, down 1 cent.
