             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from default fell to the lowest in more than two weeks,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of swaps on 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan dropped 4 basis points to 127
basis points as of 8:09 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. That’s the lowest since June 22, according to CMA
DataVision in New York.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 6 basis points
to 122.5 basis points as of 9:45 a.m. in Sydney, also to the
lowest in more than two weeks, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.
and CMA data. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 5 basis points
to 127 basis points as of 8:49 a.m. in Tokyo, the least since
June 22, Morgan Stanley and CMA prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
