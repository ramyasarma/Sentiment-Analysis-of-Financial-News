             The Seattle Mariners traded All-Star
pitcher  Cliff Lee  to the Texas Rangers, spurning an offer from
the New York Yankees, according to the New York Post.  
 Lee and relief pitcher  Mark Lowe  were sent to Texas in
exchange for first baseman Justin Smoak and three minor-
leaguers, the newspaper said on its  website  without citing its
source.  
 An e-mail seeking comment from Rangers spokesman  John Blake 
wasn’t immediately returned. The Mariners said in a news release
that they’ll hold a 3:15 local time news conference about an
undisclosed topic.  
 It would be the second straight year that Lee has been
traded, after joining the defending World Series champion
Philadelphia Phillies in a trade-deadline exchange with the
Cleveland Indians last season.  
 Lee, a 31-year-old left-hander who will be a free agent
after the season, has an 8-3 record in 13 starts and leads the
American League with a 2.34 earned run average. He is two years
removed from winning the American League Cy Young Award as the
league’s best pitcher and helped the Philadelphia Phillies reach
the World Series last year.  
 The Yankees would have sent three prospects -- catcher
Jesus Montero, second baseman David Adams and pitcher Zach
McAllister -- to Seattle in a trade that the teams were
discussing earlier today, the Post said.  
 The Rangers, who are in bankruptcy, sought approval of a
sale in May to a group led by Pittsburgh attorney Chuck
Greenberg and Hall of Fame pitcher  Nolan Ryan . The Major League
Baseball team then reversed course and is planning to auction
itself.
