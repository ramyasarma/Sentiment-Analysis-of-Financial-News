             U.S. and Russian aircraft taking part
in the swap of 14 people convicted of spying in the two
countries have left Vienna International Airport, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.  
 A Vision Airlines plane carrying 10 Russian agents deported
from the U.S. landed in Vienna this morning and parked close to
a Russian plane that had ferried to Austria four people pardoned
by Russia, the BBC said. The two aircraft have since left the
airport.  
 Television pictures earlier showed the two planes parked
close to each other at the airport.
