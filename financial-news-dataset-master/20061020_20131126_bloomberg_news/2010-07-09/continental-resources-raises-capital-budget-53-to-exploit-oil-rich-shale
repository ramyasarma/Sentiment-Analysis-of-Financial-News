             Continental Resources Inc. , the oil
and natural gas company controlled by Oklahoma billionaire
 Harold Hamm , boosted planned spending 53 percent to $1.3 billion
to accelerate drilling in five states this year.  
 Continental expects to cover some of the additional cost
with asset sales, Hamm said today in a statement. The company,
based in Enid, Oklahoma, said on July 7 it has more than tripled
a bank credit line to $2.5 billion.  
 “We are responding to tremendous opportunities to
accelerate our drilling program and to increase our valuable
acreage positions in oil-rich and liquids-rich shale plays in
the United States,” including North Dakota, Montana, western
Oklahoma, Colorado and Wyoming, Hamm said in the statement.  
 The company said production will rise as much as 17 percent
this year, up from a previous forecast of 13 percent.
Continental is getting more oil out of wells drilled into hard,
non-porous rock and fractured with a mixture of water, sand and
chemicals, Hamm said. That makes additional drilling profitable
at current prices, he said.  
 Crude oil futures rose 15 cents to $75.59 a barrel at 10:06
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The average price this
year has been $78.25, 26 percent more than last year.  
 Continental fell $1, or 2.2 percent, to $43.57 at 4:02 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has risen 1.6
percent this year.  
 Continental has added acreage in the Bakken and Anadarko
Woodford formations since Dec. 31, and intends to start its
first Niobrara Shale well this year. It operates a total of 26
drilling rigs.
