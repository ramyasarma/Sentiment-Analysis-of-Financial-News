             U.K.  producer prices  unexpectedly
dropped in June for the first time in 1 1/2 years as lower costs
of gasoline products eased  inflation  pressures in the economy.  
 The cost of goods at factory gates fell 0.3 percent from
the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said
today in London. The median forecast of 12 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.1 percent gain. A separate
report showed Britain’s trade deficit swelled in May to the
largest in four months.  
 Bank of England policy makers have split on the dangers of
inflation in the economy, with  Andrew Sentance  calling last
month for higher interest rates and the majority seeking to
maintain emergency stimulus to counter the threat of deflation.
Consumer prices rose an annual 3.4 percent in May, exceeding the
government’s 3 percent upper limit.  
 “It’s a bit of a surprise and is the start of inflation
pressures easing in the economy,”  James Knightley , an economist
at ING Financial Services in London, said in a telephone
interview. “The recent rise in sterling and the impact of the
fiscal measures as they begin to kick in later in the year will
all help curb pressures further.”  
 The pound was little changed after the release, trading at
$1.5202 as of 9:42 a.m. in London. The benchmark two-year
government bond yield was unchanged at 0.762 percent.  
 Petroleum Products  
 Producer prices  fell on the month for the first time since
November 2008, the statistics office said. Out of 10 categories
for output prices, only two rose. The drop was led by petroleum
products, scrap metal and food. From a year earlier, overall
output-price inflation slowed to 5.1 percent from 5.5 percent.  
 Raw material costs  also fell in June, dropping for a second
month by 0.2 percent, the statistics office said. Oil prices
declined 1.8 percent during the month. Crude oil traded at
$75.82 a barrel today in London.  
 So-called core producer prices, excluding food, beverages,
tobacco and gasoline, fell 0.3 percent in June, the first drop
in a year. Economists forecast a 0.1 percent monthly gain, the
median of eight forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  
 Weakening price pressures may curb margins at companies
that have bolstered earnings by charging their customers more.
 Associated British Foods Plc  said yesterday that quarterly
profit at its U.K. sugar business benefited from higher prices,
lower energy costs and the strength of the euro.  
 The pound has dropped by about a quarter against a trade-
weighted basket of currencies since the start of 2007, making
British goods cheaper abroad while raising prices of imported
raw materials.  
 Exporters are still struggling to make the most of that
weakening in the currency. The U.K.  goods-trade gap  was 8.1
billion pounds ($12.3 billion) in May, the largest since
January, the statistics office said in a separate report today.
Imports rose 2.4 percent, outpacing a 0.2 percent gain in
exports.
