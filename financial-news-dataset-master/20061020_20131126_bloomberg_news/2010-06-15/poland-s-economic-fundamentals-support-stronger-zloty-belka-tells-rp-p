             Poland’s economic fundamentals
support a stronger zloty than the currency’s current rate,
central bank Governor  Marek Belka  told rp.pl in an interview.  
 “Turbulence on financial markets won’t last forever and
everything indicates that the zloty should strengthen,” Belka
said in the interview.  
 Belka said he sees no inflation threat for the  Polish
economy  as growth lags behind potential, unemployment is high
and wage growth is slow, he said in the interview.  
 He reiterated that the central bank won’t set a target
range for the zloty’s exchange rate and will intervene only when
“the bank acknowledges the currency’s fluctuations are too
strong,” according to rp.pl.
