             Canadian  factory sales  rose in
April, the 8th increase in 10 months, on gains in primary
metals, petroleum and coal, government figures showed.  
 Sales increased 0.2 percent to C$44.5 billion ($43.2
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg predicted growth of 0.3 percent, according
to the median of 19 estimates.  
 Factory sales are recovering from the recession last year,
with their total still below the June 2008 peak of C$54.7
billion. Canada’s economy  will grow  at a second-quarter
annualized pace of 3.8 percent according to the Bank of Canada,
which led the Group of Seven with an interest-rate increase on
June 1.  
 “The recovery is looking pretty solid,” said Nathan
Janzen, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. “Most
of the risks for Canada look like they are external.”  
 The Bank of Canada’s June 1 statement called the global
economic recovery “uneven” and repeatedly mentioned the risk
posed by Europe’s debt crisis. Carney will likely raise his  key
interest rate  again at the next decision on July 20, to 0.75
percent from 0.5 percent, because the domestic economy is still
strong, Janzen said.  
 The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0294 per
U.S. dollar at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0339 yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys 97.14 U.S. cents.  
 Refineries Rebound  
 Petroleum and coal sales rose 2.1 percent to C$5.62 billion
in April, as some refineries returned to full production after
shutdowns and prices rose. Sales have gained 37 percent from a
year earlier, Statistics Canada said. Primary metal sales rose
3.6 percent to C$3.47 billion in April.  
 Bombardier Inc. said yesterday that Toronto’s public
transport authority exercised a C$770 million option for 182
light-rail vehicles included in a June 2009 contract. Deliveries
of the vehicles for Metrolinx are scheduled for between 2013 and
2020.  
 The April gains in factory sales were eroded by a 2.1
percent decline in food receipts to C$7.02 billion and a 1
percent drop in motor vehicle sales to C$3.82 billion. Excluding
cars and parts, sales rose 0.3 percent to C$39 billion.  
 New factory orders rose 0.3 percent to C$44.4 billion,
while unfilled orders declined 0.2 percent to C$52.9 billion and
inventories rose 0.3 percent to C$59.1 billion. The ratio of
inventories to sales was unchanged at 1.33, the report said.  
 Statistics Canada also changed its estimate for March
factory sales, to a 1.4 percent increase from 1.2 percent.
