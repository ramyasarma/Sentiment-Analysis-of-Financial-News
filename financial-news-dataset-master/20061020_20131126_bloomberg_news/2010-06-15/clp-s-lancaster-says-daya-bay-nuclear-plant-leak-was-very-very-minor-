             CLP Holdings Ltd. Director Richard
Lancaster said the leak from a fuel rod at China’s Daya Bay
nuclear plant was “very, very minor” and will have no effect
on the country’s plans to expand nuclear power.  
 The leak will be investigated, as all such incidents are,
Lancaster said in a phone interview today. The Daya Bay facility
is among the world’s safest nuclear facilities, he said.
