             World food prices will rise this
decade, boosted by a growing population and changing diets, the
OECD and the United Nations’  Food and Agriculture Organization 
said in their annual outlook report.  
 “Real prices of all products other than pig meat are
expected to be above their average 1997-2006 level,” the Paris-
based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and
Rome-based FAO said in the report today.  
 Grain, oilseed, meat and dairy prices, adjusted for
inflation, will climb between 2010 and 2019 compared with the
decade to 2006, before a spike in 2007 and 2008, the OECD and
FAO said. Pork prices are forecast to be kept in check by rising
supply in Brazil and China.  
 Global food production has to rise 70 percent by 2050 as
the world population expands to 9.1 billion people from about
6.8 billion people now, the FAO has said. Farm-output growth
remains on track to meet that goal, OECD and FAO said in today’s
agricultural outlook for 2010-2019.  
 Average prices for wheat and coarse grains are estimated
to be 15 percent to 40 percent higher in the coming decade,
compared with the period from 1997 to 2006, they said.
Vegetable-oil prices will be up more than 40 percent, and dairy
prices will rise between 16 percent to 45 percent, FAO and OECD
said.  
 Agricultural prices “will tend to remain” below the peak
levels of 2007 and 2008, they said. Sugar, beef and pork
didn’t share the “rapid” price rise of other products two
years ago, and are forecast to rise 10 percent to 20 percent in
the decade compared to 2007-08 prices, OECD and FAO said.  
 Cheese, Butter  
 Compared with the peak in 2007 and 2008, wheat, rice,
oilseeds, protein meal, butter, cheese and skimmed milk powder
are forecast to decline the most in inflation-adjusted terms,
according to the report.  
 “Pig meat prices are not anticipated to increase much
beyond 2014 due to a fast increase in supply with high
productivity gains in Brazil and China,” the OECD and FAO said.  
 Developing countries will be the main source of growing
agricultural output, consumption and trade, they said.
As incomes rise, diets are expected to include more meat and
processed foods, favoring livestock and dairy, according to FAO
and OECD.  
 Growth in farm production is forecast to be led by Latin
America, Eastern Europe and some Asian countries.  
 Brazil, Ukraine  
 Brazil will lift agricultural output by 40 percent through
2019, from the base period of 2007 to 2009, OECD and FAO said.
Ukraine is forecast to raise production by 29 percent in the
period, Russia and China by 26 percent and India by 21 percent.  
 Production growth in the U.S. and Canada is forecast to be
in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent, while European Union
farm output will increase by less than 4 percent, according to
the report.  
 World population growth is expected to average 1.1 percent
a year to 2019, with 2 percent growth in Africa, FAO and OECD
said. “On a per capita basis, production growth in least-
developed countries is struggling to keep up with rapid
population growth,” they said.  
 Per-capita growth of farm output has fallen in North
Africa and the Middle East, mainly because of limited water
availability, according to the report. In sub-Saharan Africa,
production per capita is expected to remain stagnant as
increased farming “barely” keeps up with population growth of
2.2 percent, according to OECD and FAO.
