             Britain’s ITV broadcaster fired
soccer announcer  Robbie Earle  after World Cup tickets given to
the former Wimbledon player for his friends and family were used
for an unlicensed marketing operation.  
 FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, questioned a group of
female soccer fans yesterday after they donned orange dresses
that are part of a promotional campaign for a Dutch beer during
the game between the Netherlands and Denmark.  
 The 27 South Africans and three Dutch citizens, who were
accused of so-called ambush marketing, were held after the
Netherlands’ opening tournament game in Johannesburg. Orange is
the official color of the Dutch team.  
 “Immediate investigations indicated that a block of ITV
tickets would appear to have been used for unauthorised purposes
during the Holland verses Denmark match,” the U.K. broadcaster
said in a  statement  on its website. “Further enquiries have
revealed that a substantial number of tickets allocated to
Robbie Earle for family and friends have been passed to a third
party in breach of FIFA rules.”  
 Earle told the U.K. Press Association that he hadn’t
profited from the tickets.  
 “Call me naive but I didn’t think I was doing anything
wrong,” Earle said, according to PA. “I hope when people hear
the full story they will see me in a different light.”
