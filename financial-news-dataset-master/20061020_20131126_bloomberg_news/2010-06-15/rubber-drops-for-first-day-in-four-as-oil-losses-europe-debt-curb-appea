             Rubber climbed for a fourth day to a
two-week high on optimism that low stockpiles in China, the
biggest buyer, and limited supplies from Thailand improved the
appeal of the commodity used to make tires.  
 Futures in Tokyo rose as much as 1.9 percent to the highest
level since June 1 on speculation that Chinese buyers will soon
accumulate rubber as stockpiles dropped to near the lowest in
five months.  
 “Low Chinese stocks spurred buying, boosting gains on the
Tokyo market,” Kant Julotok, an analyst at commodity broker
Agrowealth Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok.  
 Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the Shanghai
exchange were 17,881 metric tons, based on a survey of 10
warehouses, the bourse said on June 11. That compares with
151,832 tons on Jan. 21, the highest level since November 2004,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Rubber for November delivery advanced as much as 5.2 yen to
280 yen a kilogram ($3,073 a metric ton) before settling at
278.2 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The contract earlier
fell to 272.3 yen as declining crude oil prices and Greece’s
credit-rating downgrade threatened to weaken demand.  
 The Shanghai Futures Exchange is closed today for a holiday,
and will reopen on June 17. The September-delivery contract
settled at 21,825 yuan ($3,194) a ton on June 11.  
 Thai Supply  
 New supplies in Thailand, the biggest exporter, remain
limited as rainfall in southern provinces hampered tapping,
lowering latex production and boosting prices, said Kant.  
 “Supply averaged around 200 tons a day this month, which
is lower than it should be,” said Kant. Supplies should rise to
as much as 500 tons a day in July, he said.  
 Cash prices in Thailand extended gains as the slower-than-
usual increase in supply was insufficient to meet increasing
demand, the  Rubber Institute of Thailand  said on its website.  
 The free-on-board price of RSS-3 grade for July delivery
gained 0.6 percent to 115.10 baht ($3.55) a kilogram today, the
institute said. It reviews the price daily and issues new data
in the afternoon.
