             MEG Energy Corp., a Canadian oil-
sands developer partly owned by China’s CNOOC Ltd., may raise as
much as C$1.25 billion ($1.22 billion) in an initial public
offering, according to three people familiar with the sale.  
 MEG is seeking to raise between C$1 billion and C$1.25
billion in the second-largest IPO this year in Canada, after a
C$1.35 billion offering from  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp.  in April.  
 MEG Energy, with 840 square miles (2,175 square kilometers)
of oil-sand leases, is raising money to fund its project at
Christina Lake, which has produced oil since 2008, according to
a filing yesterday.  
 The Calgary-based company is owned by Warburg Pincus LLC, a
New York-based investment firm, which has about 26 percent of
the firm, while  CNOOC , China’s largest offshore energy producer,
holds a 17 percent stake. MEG has raised more than C$2.3 billion
of equity from private investors since 2007, the company said.  
 Credit Suisse Securities Canada is leading a group of banks
including BMO Nesbitt Burns, Barclays Capital Canada and Morgan
Stanley Canada for the sale. MEG may be priced next month,
people familiar said.  
 Companies have sold $2.85 billion in stock through IPOs in
Canada this year, 57 percent more than the $1.82 billion raised
in all of 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  
 MEG Chief Financial Officer  Dale Hohm  declined to comment
on the details of the offering.
