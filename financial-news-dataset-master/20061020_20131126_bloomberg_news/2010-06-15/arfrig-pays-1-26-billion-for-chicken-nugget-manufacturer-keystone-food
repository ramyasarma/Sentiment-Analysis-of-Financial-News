             Marfrig Alimentos SA , Latin
America’s second-largest beef producer, agreed to buy meat
processor Keystone Foods LLC for $1.26 billion to become a
supplier to restaurant chains such as  McDonald’s Corp.   
 Marfrig, based in Sao Paulo, will sell 2.5 billion reais
($1.4 billion) of five-year bonds convertible into stock to
finance the acquisition of Keystone from private equity firm
Lindsay Goldberg LCC, according to a regulatory filing published
late yesterday. Marfrig, in a separate filing today, also said
it plans to issue American depositary receipts.  
 The purchase will make Marfrig a supplier of chicken
nuggets, hamburgers and other meat products to McDonald’s,
sandwich-shop chain Subway Restaurants and  Campbell Soup Co.  in
13 countries including the U.S., France and Australia. The
meatpacker has expanded production through 38 acquisitions in
the past three years, including the takeover of Cargill Inc.’s
poultry and pork business in Brazil for $705.2 million.  
 “The acquisition is part of a broader protein and
geographical diversification project being implemented by
Marfrig,”  Fabio Monteiro  and  Thiago Duarte , two Banco BTG
Pactual SA based in Sao Paulo, said in a report today.  
 Net sales may almost triple at Marfrig this year to 27.8
billion reais after the acquisition, from 9.6 billion reais in
2009, Monteiro said.  
 Marfrig fell 3.3 percent to 16.30 reais in Sao Paulo
trading at 12:00 p.m. New York time. Earlier, it dropped to
16.29 reais, the lowest since May 28. Before today, the shares
have fallen 12 percent this year.  
 Bond Sale  
 The bonds that Marfrig plans to sell in Brazil’s domestic
market this year will mandatorily be converted into shares after
five years. They’ll be converted at 21.50 reais per share.  
 The sale of convertible bonds will likely lure demand from
current shareholders, said  Bevan Rosenbloom , an emerging-market
debt strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut.  
 Yields on Marfrig bonds due in 2016 fell 5 basis points to
9.96 percent at 11:10 a.m. New York time, Bloomberg data show.  
 Keystone, based in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania,
produces more than 1.6 billion pounds of poultry products and
388 million pounds of beef products a year and distributes them
to about 30,000  restaurants  worldwide, according to its  website .
It reported net sales of $6.4 billion in 2009.  
 Lindsay Goldberg LLC, based in New York, is a private
equity firm founded by  Alan Goldberg  and Robert Lindsay,
respectively a former private equity chief and former managing
director at Morgan Stanley.  
 JBS SA , based in Sao Paulo, is the world’s biggest beef
producer.
