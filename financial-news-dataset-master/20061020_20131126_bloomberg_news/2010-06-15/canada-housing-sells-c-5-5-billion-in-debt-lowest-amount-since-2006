             Canada Housing Trust, the financing
arm of the nation’s housing agency, sold C$5.5 billion ($5.36
billion) of five-year debt, the smallest issue at that maturity
since 2006, amid rising volatility in global bond markets.  
 “It’s a reflection of the market conditions and the
volatility we’re seeing,”  Mark Chamie , Canada Mortgage and
Housing’s treasurer, said by phone from Ottawa. “We’re just
being a little bit more conservative.”  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, which measures
volatility in U.S. Treasuries, rose to 116.7 on May 6, the
highest since October, and traded at 102.90 yesterday, up from a
low this year of 74.1 on March 17. Investors have speculated the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe may worsen, hampering the global
economic recovery. Today’s sale was the smallest since the C$5.1
billion issued in June 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “In part it’s because of what’s happening in Europe and
that’s having a knock-on effect generally,’’ said Chamie,
explaining why the Housing Trust decided to issue fewer bonds.  
 The 3.15 percent bonds maturing in June 2015 priced to
yield 42.5 basis points over equivalent-maturity Canadian
government bonds, according to an e-mailed statement from
Toronto Dominion Bank, lead coordinator of the sale.  
 Canada Housing on March 19 sold $6 billion of five-year,
2.95 percent bonds maturing in March 2015 with a price to yield
18 basis points above Canada’s 2.5 percent bonds maturing in
June 2015. That was the tightest spread in more than two years,
according CMHC data.  
 Spreads Narrow  
 The bonds were marketed yesterday at a spread of 43 basis
points above government debt. Since the sale, the yield on the
securities has tightened by 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 41.5 basis points, according to data from Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit.  
 “The order book was in the area of 30 percent
oversubscribed,”  Trevor Thom , director of debt capital markets
at Toronto-Dominion’s TD Securities unit, said by phone from
Toronto. Spreads on Canada mortgage bonds have outperformed
Canadian provincial debt, he said.  
 About 29 percent of the bonds were sold to international
investors, Chamie said, with central banks and money managers in
the U.S., Europe and Asia taking 16 percent, 5 percent and 8
percent, respectively.  
 Canada Housing Trust began selling bonds in 2001 to ensure
enough liquidity in the market for residential mortgages, which
lowers home-financing costs. Canada Housing Trust issued C$46.9
billion in mortgage bonds last year, up about 8 percent from the
C$43.5 billion a year earlier.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, National Bank Financial and
Royal Bank of Canada were also part of the syndicate handling
the sale.
