             LG Telecom Ltd. , South Korea’s
smallest mobile-phone operator, forecasts smartphones will
account for 40 percent of the company’s handsets this year.  
 The Seoul-based company plans to introduce seven to eight
smartphones in 2010 after lagging behind bigger rivals,  Lee Sang Chul , LG’s chief executive officer, told reporters today.  
 LG Telecom, which merged with fixed-line affiliates  LG
Dacom Corp.  and  LG Powercom Corp.  last year, faces increased
competition from  SK Telecom Co.  and  KT Corp.  in South Korea’s
smartphone market as carriers seek to boost wireless Internet
sales to offset stalling revenue growth. Smartphone users will
account for 9 percent of South Korea’s total mobile-phone
subscribers in 2010 and 17.8 percent in 2011, according to  Yang Jong In , an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co.  
 Sales of smartphones in South Korea may reach as much as 5
million units this year compared with less than 1 million in
2009, according to  Baek Jong Suk , an analyst at Hyundai
Securities Co.  
 Seoul-based LG Telecom last month reported first-quarter
profit rose more than five-fold on higher sales of high-speed
Internet services after the merger with Dacom and Powercom.  
 LG Telecom accounted for 17.9 percent of the Korean mobile-
phone market at the end of April, compared with SK Telecom’s
50.7 percent and KT’s 31.4 percent, according to the latest
government data.  
 LG Telecom was unchanged at 7,850 won at 11:36 a.m. in
Seoul  trading . The benchmark Kospi index gained 0.1 percent.
