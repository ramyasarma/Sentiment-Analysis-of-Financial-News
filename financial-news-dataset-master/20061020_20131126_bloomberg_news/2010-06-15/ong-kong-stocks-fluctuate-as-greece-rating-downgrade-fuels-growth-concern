             Most  Hong Kong stocks  rose, lifting
the Hang Seng Index to its longest winning streak in 13 months,
amid speculation economic growth in China can weather measures
to curb Chinese property prices and Europe’s debt crisis.  
 China Resources Enterprise Ltd., which receives 87 percent
of its sales from mainland China, climbed 2.1 percent after a
gauge of leading indicators for the Chinese economy rose.  Esprit
Holdings Ltd. , which gets 85 percent of its revenue from Europe,
lost 3.3 percent after Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s
credit rating to non-investment grade. Tencent Holdings Ltd.
sank 3.1 percent after the company’s chairman reduced his stake.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  added 0.1 percent to 20,062.15 at the
close of trading, with five stocks advancing for every three
that dropped. The gauge has climbed 3.5 percent in the past six
days, the longest series of gains since the seven trading days
to May 8, 2009. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of Chinese
companies’ so-called H-shares added 0.3 percent to 11,556.45.  
 “Growth is holding up pretty well,” said  Binay Chandgothia ,
who oversees about $2.2 billion as chief investment officer at
Principal Global Investors (Hong Kong). “The biggest concern is
how countries in Europe can control their deficits without
sacrificing too much by way of growth.”  
 The Hang Seng Index slumped 6.4 percent last month, the
most since January. Concerns over budget deficits in Europe and
speculation China’s government will further tighten money supply
have contributed to a 13 percent drop in the stock gauge from
its November high. Shares on the measure are priced at an
average  13.2 times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov.
16, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 ‘Sharp’ Increase  
 China-related stocks advanced as the Conference Board said
an indicator for the Chinese economy, the world’s third biggest,
rose “sharply” in April. The measure gained 1.7 percent to
147.1, compared with a revised 1.2 percent increase in March,
the New York-based research organization said today.  
 China Resources climbed 2.1 percent to HK$28.70. Industrial
& Commercial Bank of China Ltd. rose 0.7 percent to HK$5.79.
China Construction Bank Corp., the world’s second-largest lender
by market value, advanced 0.6 percent to HK$6.30.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring in June increased
0.3 percent to 20,145. The gauge turned between gains and losses
at least 19 times today as investor sentiment wavered between
optimism for Chinese growth and concerns over Europe debt.  
 Suncorp Technologies Ltd. , a Hong Kong-based maker and
seller of telephone equipment surged 18 percent to 19.6 Hong
Kong cents after the company said it may buy Top Match Holdings
Ltd., which holds a 50-year right to operate a fiber optic
network in China.  
 Greece’s Debt Rating  
 Stocks in the U.S. fell yesterday, with the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  slipping 0.2 percent after Moody’s cut Greece’s
credit rating by four levels to Ba1 from A3. Moody’s cited
“substantial” risks to economic growth from the austerity
measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134 billion) aid package
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  
 Esprit slumped 3.1 percent to HK$45.25 following a 8.6
percent surge in the past three days.  
 “The markets had a run up in the last few days and were
probably looking for a reason to correct,” said Principal’s
Chandgothia.  
 Tencent declined 3.1 percent to HK$127.40, the second-
biggest drop in the Hang Seng Index after Esprit. Chairman Ma
Huateng lowered his stake in the Chinese Internet company to
11.2 percent from 11.47 percent, according to a filing with the
Hong Kong stock exchange.  
 China Lilang Ltd., owner of China’s biggest men’s clothing
brand, tumbled 8.3 percent to HK$8.62. Ming Lang Investments
Ltd., China Lilang’s  second-biggest investor , agreed to sell 80
million shares for HK$8.50 each, reducing its stake to 5.71
percent from 12.38 percent, Lilang said.
