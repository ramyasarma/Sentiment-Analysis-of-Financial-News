             Byron Wien , vice chairman of
Blackstone Group LP’s advisory services division, said hedge
fund returns may shrink by half as firms seek to protect
investors’ capital.  
 Returns may drop to 10 percent from 20 percent as funds
lose their “zeal,” Wien, 77, told the  GAIM International  hedge
fund conference at Monaco’s Grimaldi Forum today.  
 “I’m worried that by trying to protect capital on the
downside they give up too much on the upside,” he said. “The
concept of hedge funds was to produce equity-like returns with
bond-like volatility. The danger is we get bond-like returns
with equity-like volatility.”  
 Hedge funds lost an average of 2.6 percent in May, the
worst month since November 2008, according to the HFRX Global
Hedge Fund Index. The S&P 500 retreated 8.2 percent, the biggest
monthly drop since February 2007.  
 Wien called for a stock market rally in the U.S. last week,
saying that Europe’s debt crisis caused too much pessimism in
the U.S., where profits for companies in the Standard & Poor’s
500 index are projected to rise 17 percent this year. He
forecasts the  S&P 500  will climb to 1,300 from 1,089 before
ending the year around 1100, where it started.  
 In April, he forecast that oil would go to $100 a barrel.
At the time it was trading at $87, and is now trading at $75.25.  
 Wien called last year’s rally in stocks, oil and gold
correctly. He incorrectly predicted that the dollar would fall
to $1.65 against the euro. It fell to $1.51 in November 2009 and
is now trading at $1.22.  
 Wien was chief strategist at hedge fund Pequot Capital
Management Inc. from 2005 to 2009. He was a senior strategist at
Morgan Stanley before joining Pequot.
