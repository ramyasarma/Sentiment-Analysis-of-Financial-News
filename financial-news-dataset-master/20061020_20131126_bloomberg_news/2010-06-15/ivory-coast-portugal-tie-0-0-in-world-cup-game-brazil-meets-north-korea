             Ivory Coast and Portugal tied 0-0 in
the opening game of Group G in soccer’s World Cup in South
Africa.  
 Portugal captain  Cristiano Ronaldo  hit the post with a
first-half shot as neither goalkeeper was severely tested at
Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth.  
 Ivory Coast striker  Didier Drogba  came on as a substitute
in the second half with a protective cast on his broken right
arm. The injury was sustained in a warmup match against Japan on
June 4.  
 Five-time champion Brazil and North Korea play their first
game in Group G later today in Johannesburg.  
 Ronaldo, who didn’t score in any of Portugal’s qualifying
matches, almost gave his team the lead in the 11th minute with a
right-footed shot from 25 yards which cracked off the left post.  
 Drogba came on for Chelsea teammate  Salomon Kalou  in the
66th minute. He had one late chance but couldn’t get a clear
shot and sent the ball across the front of the goal.  
 Earlier, Winston Reid scored in the final seconds of injury
time to give New Zealand a 1-1 tie with Slovakia in Group F.  
 Reid headed in a cross from Shane Smeltz to give New
Zealand its first-ever point in four World Cup games.  Robert Vittek  scored in the 50th minute for Slovakia.
