             Indonesia’s economy may grow 6.1
percent to 6.4 percent next year, supported by domestic
consumption and investment, Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo 
said today.  
 “We hope growth can be supported by household consumption
that stays strong, the improving investment climate and the
increase in export activities,” Martowardojo told reporters in
Jakarta after a hearing with lawmakers today.  
 Indonesia’s  economy  grew at the fastest pace in more than a
year last quarter, joining an Asian rebound as the region leads
a recovery from last year’s global recession. That momentum may
falter as Greece’s near default has prompted governments from
Germany to Spain to implement budget cuts to convince investors
they can tame deficits, threatening to damp demand.  
 The crisis in Greece may have the “potential to hinder
growth,” Martowardojo said, after central bank Senior Deputy
Governor Darmin Nasution said June 2 the European situation had
no “direct” impact on Indonesia.  
 The rupiah slid for the first time in six days today on
concern investors will pare holdings of higher-yielding assets
after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Greece’s sovereign
rating to junk. The currency traded at 9,170 per dollar at 5:03
p.m. local time.  
 The rupiah may trade between 9,100 and 9,400 against the
dollar next year, Martowardojo said during the hearing.
Indonesia’s economic growth and higher interest rates compared
with other countries are supporting the rupiah, Nasution told
reporters in Jakarta after attending the same meeting today.  
 Inflation may range between 4.9 percent and 5.3 percent in
2011, the finance minister said. Gross domestic product in
Southeast Asia’s largest economy increased 5.7 percent in the
three months to March 31 from a year earlier.
