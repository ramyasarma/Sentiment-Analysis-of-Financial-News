             The U.S. Federal Reserve approved
rules to protect credit-card holders from unreasonable late-
payment fees and to require issuers to review interest-rate
increases.  
 The Fed’s  rules  prohibit credit-card issuers from charging
consumers more than $25 for paying late unless the card holder
has “engaged in repeated violations,” bans inactivity fees for
not using the card, prevents multiple penalties on a single late
payment and requires issuers that have increased rates since
Jan. 1, 2009, to consider reducing those rates, according to a
statement today.  
 “The new rules require that late payment and other penalty
fees be assessed in a way that is fairer and generally less
costly for consumers,” said Federal Reserve Governor  Elizabeth Duke  in the statement. “Card issuers must also reevaluate
recent interest rate increases and, if appropriate, reduce the
rate.”  
 President  Barack Obama  signed credit-card legislation in
May 2009 to be implemented in three stages. Provisions of the
law already in effect include giving consumers the right to
reject rate increases within 45 days and to pay off balances at
current rates. Companies also must mail bills 21 days before due
dates, up from 14 days previously.  
 Today’s provisions take effect on Aug. 22.  
 “These new rules will provide greater protection,
transparency and certainty for credit-card customers and the
industry will work quickly and diligently to ensure that they
are implemented by their effective date,” said Kenneth Clayton,
senior vice president and general counsel for card policy at the
American Bankers Association in Washington.
