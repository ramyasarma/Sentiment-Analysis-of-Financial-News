             San Miguel Corp.,  which is expanding
from food and drinks into power generation, said it will bid for
the contract on the production of a Philippine government-owned
650-megawatt diesel-fired power plant at an auction tomorrow.  
 San Miguel President  Ramon Ang  made the statement in a
mobile phone message.  
 San Miguel has acquired power plants and power contracts
amounting to more than 2,000 megawatts of generating capacity in
the past year and says it plans to build plants with 3,000
megawatts of capacity within five years.  
 The plant to be sold tomorrow, in Malaya, Rizal province
east of Manila, was taken over by Korea Electric Power Corp. in
1995, which agreed to rehabilitate and run it in exchange for
the government’s contract to buy its output. The agreement and
contract end in 2011.  
 First Gen Corp. , the Southeast Asian nation’s largest power
producer, has been shortlisted to join the auction, its Chief
Financial Officer  Giles Puno  said on June 10.  Aboitiz Power Corp.  
won’t submit a bid, President  Erramon Aboitiz  said today.
Aboitiz Power fell 1.4 percent to 18 pesos.
