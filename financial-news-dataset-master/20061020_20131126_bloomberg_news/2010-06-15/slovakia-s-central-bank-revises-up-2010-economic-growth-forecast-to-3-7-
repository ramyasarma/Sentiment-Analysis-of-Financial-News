             The Slovak economy will probably
grow 3.7 percent this year, the central bank said, revising its
previous forecast of a 3.2 percent expansion.  
 Growth  will probably accelerate to 4.3 percent in 2011 and
4.4 percent in 2012, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based central bank
said today. The projections compare with March forecasts of 4.4
percent in 2011 and 4.2 percent in 2012.  
 Slovakia, a euro-region member since 2009, is recovering
from its first full-year recession as a revival in Western
Europe fuels demand for exports including cars assembled by
Volkswagen AG. The economy grew an annual 4.8 percent in the
first quarter, the fastest pace in the European Union.  
 “The upward revision to growth reflects expectations for
faster export growth driven by reviving demand in western
Europe,” central bank Governor  Jozef Makuch  said in Bratislava.
“At the same time, elevated unemployment will continue to
constrain growth by eroding consumer spending power.”  
 The central bank estimates an average  inflation  rate of
0.8 percent this year, compared with a March projection of 0.7
percent. In 2011 and 2012, average inflation is set to increase
to 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
