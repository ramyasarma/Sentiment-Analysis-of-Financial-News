             Renaissance Group, the parent 
company of Moscow-based investment bank Renaissance Capital, 
may sell its consumer-lending business in Ukraine, Vedomosti 
reported, citing Renaissance Credit.   
 Renaissance’s shareholders want to focus on consumer 
lending in Russia, which is more profitable than Ukraine, the 
Moscow-based newspaper said today.
