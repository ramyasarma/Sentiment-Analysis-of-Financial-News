             Tokyo Commodity Exchange  Inc., which
runs Japan’s largest raw materials futures bourse, said it has
begun negotiations to take over energy futures from the  Central
Japan Commodity Exchange  in October.  
 Tocom informed Nagoya-based C-COM, Japan’s third-largest
commodities bourse by volume, that it is willing to consider
taking over its gasoline and kerosene futures as early as Oct.
12, Tocom said in a faxed statement today. Tocom, which already
trades similar contracts, wants C-COM’s delivery points in
western Japan to expand its service from the east.  
 Commodity brokerages and exchanges have been under pressure
after law changes in 2005 limited small investors’ access,
shrinking volume, and as competition from overseas bourses
increased. Japan now has four commodity exchanges, from seven in
March 2006.  
 C-COM trades gasoline and kerosene contracts with a
contract size and delivery unit of 10 kiloliters. Tocom has a
contract size of 50 kiloliters and a delivery unit of 100
kiloliters. Tocom also trades gold, silver, platinum, palladium,
crude oil and rubber.  
 C-COM plans to hold a board meeting on June 18. The
exchange denied a Nikkei report on May 19 that said it will
cease operations by the end of January 2011 because of declining
transactions.  
 Japan’s commodity futures trading volume slumped 33 percent
in 2009 and 28 percent in 2008, according to the  Japan Commodity
Clearing House . Tocom represented 81 percent of the volume of
the four commodities exchanges in the year ended March 31,
followed by the  Tokyo Grain Exchange  with 13 percent and C-COM
with 5 percent.
