             Russian stocks advanced to their
highest level in more than a month as oil traded above $76 and
after billionaire  Dmitry Rybolovlev ’s sale of a controlling
stake in OAO Uralkali generated speculation there would be
further acquisitions.  
 Uralkali , the country’s second-biggest potash maker, rose
as much as 5.5 percent and steelmaker  OAO Severstal  advanced 3.8
percent.  OAO Gazprom , the nation’s gas export monopoly, added
2.1 percent. The  Micex Index  climbed 2.6 percent to 1,371.31 at
the close in Moscow, its highest level since May 13 after local
equities caught up on yesterday’s gains on global markets
following a public holiday. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
added 0.7 percent.  
 Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, climbed as much as
$1.58 to $76.70 a barrel, boosting the earnings outlook for
producers in the world’s biggest energy exporter. The Micex has
slipped more than 10 percent from its April 15 peak and Russian
corporate bonds are trading at the most expensive level compared
with stocks since January 2009, just before the Micex began its
biggest rally in a decade.  
 “Uralkali has had a bounce thanks to this takeover and
there is some speculation of further mergers and acquisitions”
in the industry,  John Heisel , a sales trader at Citigroup Inc.
in Moscow, said by telephone. “Otherwise the market is just
catching up on the gains made by oil and Russian depositary
receipts.”  
 Billionaires Buy  
 Uralkali had its biggest intraday jump in two weeks after
Rybolovlev sold a controlling stake to Russian billionaires
 Suleiman Kerimov ,  Alexander Nesis  and Filaret Galchev. Kaliha
Finance Ltd., owned by Kerimov, acquired 25 percent of Uralkali,
the largest stake. The buyers paid $23 for each depositary
receipt, according to Interfax, which valued the company at $9.8
billion.  
 Kerimov also acquired a 20 percent stake of  OAO Silvinit ,
Russia’s largest potash producer, from Rybolovlev, Vedomosti
reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Silvinit added
6.7 percent to 19,002.21 rubles, its highest level since April
21.  
 OAO Sberbank , climbed 5.1 percent to 75.92 rubles, its
strongest close since May 18 as the ruble advanced for a fourth
day against the dollar, encouraging Russians to keep their
savings in local-currency deposits. Shares of Sberbank yield an
estimated 9.5 percent in earnings, compared with the 4.7 percent
on its dollar notes due July 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Gazprom has an estimated earnings yield, or profit relative
to its share price, of 21 percent while its dollar bonds due
April 2019 are returning 7.3 percent. Severstal will yield 10
percent in profits this year, based on nine analyst forecasts on
Bloomberg, while its U.S. currency debt due July 2013 has a
payout of 7.3 percent.
