             China’s  Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Operations and Management Co.  said generators are operating
safely and in a stable manner, and that some media reports
related to a nuclear leak are untrue.  
 There was no change to radioactivity levels in the
surrounding area, according to environmental monitoring figures,
the operator  said  on its website today. Two additional layers,
including a safety shell, would contain any further radioactive
material, the company said, without specifying which reports it
called false.  
 China’s Daya Bay nuclear power plant had a “very small
leakage” from a fuel rod last month that was contained, CLP
Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest electricity supplier, said in
a separate statement earlier.  
 The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is 50 kilometers
(31 miles) from Hong Kong’s Tsim Sha Tsui district. The facility
has been in commercial operation since 1994 and generates 10
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year to Hong Kong and
Guangdong province, according to the website of the Hong Kong
Nuclear Investment Company Ltd., a CLP unit that owns 25 percent
of the plant. State-owned Guangdong Nuclear Investment Co. owns
the remaining 75 percent.  
 An investigation into the incident is in progress, CLP said.
CLP released a statement in response to a report on Radio
Free Asia, which it described as erroneous.
