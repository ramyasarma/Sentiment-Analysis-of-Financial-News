             Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, reported first-quarter profit
that rose less than analysts projected as some U.S. shoppers
bought fewer games and movies. The shares fell the most in six
months.  
 Earnings  increased to 36 cents a share, Best Buy said
today. Analysts on average projected 50 cents, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales  at U.S. stores open at
least 14 months rose 1.9 percent, trailing the median estimate
of 3.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  
 U.S. comparable-store sales of televisions, music, films
and gaming merchandise fell, eating into gains from notebook
computers and mobile phones. Selling, general and administrative
costs climbed 12 percent, eroding profit.  
 “They were planning expenses for higher comparable store
sales and when they didn’t materialize, that drove a bigger
 earnings  miss,”  Matt Arnold , an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.
in Des Peres, Missouri, said today by telephone. He advises
 investors  to hold on to the shares.  
 Best Buy, based in Richfield, Minnesota, fell $2.49, or 6.1
percent, to $38.56 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . The drop was the largest since Dec. 15.  
 Total comparable-store sales rose 2.8 percent, with an
international gain of 6.3 percent. The U.S. accounts for almost
three-fourths of Best Buy’s revenue.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dunn  is looking to lure
shoppers as they start spending again during the economic
recovery. Purchases at U.S. retailers unexpectedly dropped last
month, according to Commerce Department figures, signaling that
consumers are saving more.  
 Missing Expectations  
 “While our financial results in the fiscal first quarter
were below expectations, we remain confident that the strategic
investments we are making will deliver more robust connected
solutions for customers and support increased margin
expansion,” Chief Financial Officer  Jim Muehlbauer  said in a
statement.  
 Profit in the quarter ended May 29 climbed to $155 million
from $153 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. The
company also reiterated that full-year profit probably will be
$3.45 to $3.60 a share.
