             Chile’s copper export revenue rose
30 percent in May compared with a year earlier as increasing
demand for the metal in China helped boost prices.  
 Revenue was $2.76 billion last month, compared with $2.11
billion in the prior period, according to a statement posted
today on the central bank’s website.  
 Copper has risen 33 percent in the past year in London as
China boosted its use of the metal used in power cables and
electrical wire. Rising demand from the Asian nation, coupled
with production constraints, will leave the metal in short
supply through 2014, Societe Generale said in a June 11 report.  
 Chile’s copper revenue dropped 12.6 percent in May compared
with the previous month after prices slid 11.2 percent between
April and May, bank data showed.  
 Futures for September delivery slipped 0.75 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $3.005 a pound at 8:29 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months dropped 0.2 percent to
$6,645 a ton on the London Metal Exchange.
