             The U.S. and South Korea told North
Korea to stop provocative behavior after the communist nation
said it will respond militarily to any accusation by the  United
Nations  of complicity in the sinking of a South Korean warship.  
 “If the Security Council releases any document against us,
condemning us or questioning us, I myself can do nothing, but
follow-up measures will be carried out by our military forces,”
North Korea’s Ambassador to the UN, Sin Son Ho, told reporters
yesterday in New York. Sin refused to rule out the use of his
nation’s nuclear weapons, saying they are a “deterrent because
we are always threatened.”  
 North Korea’s rhetoric is “not desirable,” Kim Young Sun,
a spokesman for South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said today in
Seoul.  Kim Jong Il ’s government should act responsibly, U.S.
State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said in Washington
yesterday.  
 North Korea’s envoy was responding to South Korea’s June 14
report to the UN  Security Council  on the findings of a
multinational investigation into the March 26 sinking of the
South Korean warship Cheonan. The panel concluded that a North
Korean-made torpedo caused the sinking, killing 46 sailors.  
 North Korea has repeatedly threatened military action in
retaliation for diplomatic moves, including a warning in March,
reported by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, of
“unprecedented nuclear strikes.” Sin yesterday repeated a June
3 statement by the communist government that war might begin
“any moment” on the Korean peninsula.  
 Responsible Behavior  
 “That sounds like the same kind of provocative behavior
that has characterized North Korea, unfortunately,” Crowley
told reporters. “What we need from North Korea is first of all
accountability. And secondly we need behavior that we think is
more consistent with a responsible state.”  
 President  Barack Obama  late yesterday extended economic
sanctions on North Korea by a year, saying the communist nation
still poses a threat to U.S. security. Obama extended the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act that was scheduled
to expire this month, the White House said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Obama’s predecessor George W. Bush imposed the sanctions,
which include restrictions on property dealings, in 2008. Obama
extended the measures by a year in June 2009.  
 UN Resolution  
 South Korea is asking for a Security Council resolution
condemning North Korea for sinking the Cheonan, demanding an
apology and a commitment there will be no repeat of the attack
and calling for a return to stability in the region.  
 Crowley said the U.S. wants the Security Council to adopt a
“strong response” and that North Korea’s government “cannot
expect us to continue a business-as-usual approach when they go
about sinking the Cheonan.”  
 Sin said the U.S. and South Korea conspired to concoct a
“funny story” about the sinking in an effort to influence
South Korean and U.S. elections this year. The U.S. used the
incident to persuade Japan to allow a U.S. base to remain on the
island of Okinawa, to build support for arms sales to South
Korea and to delay the handover to South Korea of control of
military forces along the demilitarized zone between the two
Koreas, he said.  
 The North Korean ambassador, who theorized that the Cheonan
might have run aground on “rocks,” said his government wants
to send an investigative team to the site of the sinking. South
Korea has rejected such a demand.  
 China and Russia, which have veto power on the UN Security
Council, had resisted criticizing Kim Jong Il’s regime for the
attack.
