             Infineon Technologies AG  is weighing
options for its mobile-chip unit that could include a sale,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  
 The chipmaker hired  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and opened a data
room for potential buyers to review its books, according to one
of the people, who declined to be identified because the
situation is private.  
 Infineon’s wireless solutions business had 917 million
euros ($1.13 billion) in sales last year, or about 30 percent of
the Neubiberg, Germany-based company’s total revenue. Mobile-
phone chip-manufacturing capacity is becoming more important as
devices such as  Apple Inc.’s  iPhone drive demand for the
specialized components.  
 JPMorgan’s role was earlier reported by Financial Times
Deutschland.  
 While Infineon has a leading position in industrial chips,
“it is a small player in the mobile-phone chip market,” which
has lower margins, UniCredit Bank analyst  Guenther Hollfelder 
said in a note to clients today.  
 JPMorgan’s London-based spokeswoman  Sarah Oppler  declined
to comment, as did Infineon spokesman  Christian Hoenicke .
