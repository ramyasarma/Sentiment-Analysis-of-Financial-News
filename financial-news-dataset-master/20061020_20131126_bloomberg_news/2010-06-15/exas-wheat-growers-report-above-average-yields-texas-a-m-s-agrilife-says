             Texas wheat producers are reporting
above-average yields in some growing areas, according to a
 report  today by the Texas AgriLife Extension Service, a division
of Texas A&M University.  
 Grain elevators are “having a hard time handling the
volume of wheat” being collected, Steven Sparkman, an extension
agent for Hardeman County in north-central Texas, said in the
report. Because of the ample supply, some elevators are offering
to pay $1.75 a bushel below the price of Kansas City futures
contracts, wider than the normal discount of 60 cents to 70
cents, according to the report.
