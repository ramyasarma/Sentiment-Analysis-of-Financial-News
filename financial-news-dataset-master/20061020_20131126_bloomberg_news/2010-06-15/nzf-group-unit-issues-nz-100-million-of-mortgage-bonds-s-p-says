             NZF Group Ltd.  issued NZ$100 million
($69 million) of residential mortgage-backed bonds in the
nation’s first sale of such securities since 2007.  
 The non-bank lender priced the main AAA rated class of
notes, totaling NZ$87.8 million, to yield 175 basis points more
than the bank bill reference rate, according to an e-mailed
statement from Westpac Banking Corp., which managed the sale.  
 The sale is a “key funding tool for NZF,” diversifying
the lender’s funding base and freeing up money for “future loan
origination,” according to the statement.  
 NZF’s deal reopens New Zealand’s mortgage bond market,
which slammed shut in 2007 as losses on notes backed by U.S.
subprime mortgages saw investors shun all but the safest of
securities. Upgrades of Australian and New Zealand structured
finance bonds such as RMBS outnumbered downgrades by over three
to one in 2009 as home owners kept up with payments on their
loans, Fitch Ratings said in a statement today, using data based
on the bonds that it rates.  
 NZF’s mortgage notes are backed by loans to 348 borrowers,
according to the statement.
