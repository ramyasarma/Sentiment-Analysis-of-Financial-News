             Turkey’s banking regulator will
allow banks to sell lira-denominated bonds in the country,
setting a maximum size for the borrowing depending on each
bank’s financial strength and liquidity.  
 “Not every bank is the same and we need to set objective
criteria to test each one and set an amount,” chief regulator
 Tevfik Bilgin  said in an interview in Ankara yesterday. He said
a mechanism based on liquidity levels and other criteria that
would give each bank a clear limit would be ready “before the
winter.”  
 Bilgin’s Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Board in March
blocked planned bond sales by banks including  Finansbank AS ,
owned by  National Bank of Greece SA , and  Akbank TAS  saying the
global situation was risky and borrowing by banks would compete
with debt sales by the Treasury and industrial companies.  
 The regulator recognizes the need of banks to raise
resources while their  lending  grows 12 percent annually, about
twice as fast as deposits are increasing, Bilgin said.  
 The global situation is clearer now and the regulator is
satisfied that the Turkish units of European banks are “in good
shape,” Bilgin said. “They’re meeting all the criteria,
there’s no problem and there won’t be in the future.”  
 Banks may also free up more resources by lowering their
capital adequacy ratios from an average of about 20 percent
closer to a target of 12 percent, Bilgin said.
