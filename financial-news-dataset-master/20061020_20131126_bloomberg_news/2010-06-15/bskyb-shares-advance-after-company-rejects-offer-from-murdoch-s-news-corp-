             British Sky Broadcasting Plc shares
rose as much as 21 percent in London trading after the U.K.’s
biggest pay-TV provider rejected an offer from Rupert Murdoch-
controlled News Corp to take full control of the company.   
 BSkyB, based in Isleworth, England, rejected the offer of
700 pence per share, it said today in a statement. News Corp.’s
offer for the 61 percent stake of BSkyB that it doesn’t already
own is valued at 7.8 billion pounds, the New York-based company
said in a statement.
