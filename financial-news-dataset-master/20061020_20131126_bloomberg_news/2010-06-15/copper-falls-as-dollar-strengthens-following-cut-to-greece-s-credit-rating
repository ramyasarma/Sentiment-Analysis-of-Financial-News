             Copper rose for the sixth straight
session as a weaker dollar lifted demand for commodities.  
 The  U.S. dollar  slipped as much as 0.7 percent against a
basket of major currencies. Copper gained 9.4 percent in six
sessions as the greenback lost 2.8 percent. The metal also rose
after a report showed manufacturing in the  New York  region
gained for an 11th consecutive month, boosting the demand
outlook.  
 “We still feel strongly that metals as a sector are going
to rise,” said  Andrew Karsh , who helps manage $4.8 billion for
the Credit Suisse Total Commodity Return Strategy team in New
York. “Copper is going to be a key benefactor of upward
momentum once we get some economic certainty in the markets.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 1.15 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $3.024 a pound on the Comex in New York. The
six-day advance is the longest since August 2007. Prices have
declined 9.6 percent in 2010 as the European debt crisis roiled
commodity markets.  
 “There continues to be a lot of caution in the market,”
said  Michael Gross , an analyst at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
Florida. “Right now, there are too many uncertainties for bulls
to saddle up.”  
 On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $20, or 0.3 percent, to $6,680 a metric ton ($3.03 a
pound). Aluminum, lead, tin and zinc also gained, while nickel
fell.
