             Polish prosecutors will probably ask
a court tomorrow to hand over to Germany an Israeli citizen
wanted for document fraud in connection with the assassination
of a Hamas official in Dubai in January.  
 “The motion is being prepared and may be submitted to the
court already tomorrow,” after which a judge will have 40 days
to consider it, Monika Lewandowska, a spokeswoman for the Warsaw
prosecutor’s office, said by phone today.  
 The man, identified by Lewandowska only as Uri B., in line
with Polish law, was arrested at Warsaw’s Okecie airport after
Germany issued a European arrest warrant for him. Under the
warrant, suspects are “surrendered” rather than extradited
within the European Union, she said.  
 German prosecutors allege that Uri Brodsky helped a fellow
Mossad agent obtain a German passport to enter Dubai and assist
in the murder of  Mahmoud al-Mabhouh , a founder of the armed wing
of Hamas.
