             Greece’s “powerful” steps to
overhaul the economy should enable it to escape the fiscal
crisis without having to restructure its debt, said  Pier Carlo Padoan , chief economist of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  
 Speaking a day after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded
Greece’s debt to junk status, Padoan lauded Prime Minister
George Papandreou’s efforts to cut the  deficit  and make the
economy more competitive.  
 “I am convinced that Greece can make it without
restructuring because they are doing all the painful things --
both in the fiscal and in the structural domain -- which need to
be done,” Padoan said at the  Lisbon Council  in Brussels.  
 Greek bonds fell today, pushing the 10-year yield to 9.28
percent, the highest since European leaders on May 10 followed
up a 110 billion-euro ($135 billion) aid package for Greece by
offering another 750 billion euros to other fiscally distressed
governments.  
 Buyers of credit-default swaps put the probability of a
Greek default at 48 percent within five years, according to CMA
DataVision.  
 Papandreou delivered a “very, very powerful speech” about
Greece’s economic revamp at a June 11 forum in Vienna, Padoan
said. “Why should I not believe the prime minister?”  
 Padoan said the euro’s decline from an all-time high of
$1.60 in July 2008 is helping prop up the European economy,
cushioning the impact of the debt crisis as it spreads from
Greece to countries such as Spain and Portugal.  
 “The euro has depreciated significantly,” he said.
“Frankly, I don’t complain. It’s better to have a euro at $1.20
than $1.50. It adds a little bit of growth.”  
 The euro rose for a second day against the dollar, trading
at $1.2257 at 11:45 a.m. in London.
