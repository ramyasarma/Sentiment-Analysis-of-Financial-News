             India’s 10-year  bonds  rose, snapping
a four-day decline, after Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee 
signaled policy makers aren’t considering a third increase in
borrowing costs this year.  
 Yields fell from a six-week high after Mukherjee said
yesterday that he isn’t in favor of “altering” interest rates
now. Wholesale-price  inflation  quickened to 10.16 percent in May,
the most since October 2008, a government report showed
yesterday. The  Reserve Bank of India  raised its  benchmark rate 
by a quarter-percentage point in March and April each to the
current level of 3.75 percent.  
 “Some bond investors are drawing comfort from the finance
minister’s comments, which seem to play down the odds of an
immediate rate increase,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager
at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
three basis points to 7.66 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price rose 0.22, or 22 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to
100.98.  
 The benchmark bond rose as much as 69 paise earlier. It
pared gains after Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor K.C.
Chakrabarty said inflation is a bigger concern for Indian policy
makers than the Europe debt crisis, and that there is a
possibility the central bank may raise rates.  
 Mukherjee said today that inflation remains “an area of
concern” and the central bank will take “appropriate action.”  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, rose to 5.47 percent from 5.31 percent yesterday.
