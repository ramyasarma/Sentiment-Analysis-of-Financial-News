             New Zealand dairy exports, which
make up a fifth of the nation’s total overseas trade, are likely
to surge 58 percent over the next four years on rising prices
and demand, according to Ministry of Agriculture forecasts.  
 Dairy exports will rise to NZ$15.67 billion ($10.9 billion)
by the year ending June 30, 2014, from an estimated NZ$9.94
billion in the current year, the government said in its
 Situation and Outlook for New Zealand Agriculture and Forestry 
report today.  
 Sales by  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd ., the world’s
largest dairy exporter, and rivals are being buoyed by demand
from China. Better returns are encouraging farmers to increase
the size of their herds, which will boost production, according
to the forecasts.  
 The ministry projects the national milking herd will
increase to more than 5 million by 2014, and production will
rise 22 percent between 2014 and 2010.  
 Payments to farmers are expected to fall in 2011 because of
increased global supply and lower world  prices , the ministry
said. By 2014, payments will have recovered reflecting increased
demand and a lower exchange rate, it said.
