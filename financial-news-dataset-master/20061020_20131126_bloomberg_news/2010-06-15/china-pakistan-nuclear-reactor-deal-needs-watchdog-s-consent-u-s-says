             China’s deal to sell Pakistan two
nuclear reactors can’t go forward without approval from the
international body that monitors the transfer of nuclear
technology, a U.S. official said today.  
 “We have asked China to clarify the details of its sale of
additional nuclear reactors to Pakistan,” said State Department
spokesman  Philip J. Crowley . “This appears to extend beyond
cooperation that was grandfathered when China was approved for
membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.”  
 The sale may violate international rules that bar the sale
of nuclear technology to countries that haven’t signed the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or don’t meet international
safety standards for their reactors.  
 For the U.S., the deal is complicated by the need for it to
maintain good relations with Pakistan, an important ally in the
effort to stabilize Afghanistan. The U.S. may also have set a
precedent for the China-Pakistan deal in 2008, when it pushed
the Nuclear Supplier Group to give it an exemption for trade
with India, Pakistan’s rival.  
 Crowley said the U.S. has had “periodic discussions” with
China about the sale. “We believe that such cooperation would
require a specific exemption approved by consensus by the
Supplier’s Group as was done by India,” he said.  
 China joined the 46-nation group in 2004.
