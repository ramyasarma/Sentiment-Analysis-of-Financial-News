             Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba
was cleared by FIFA to play with a protective cast on his arm in
his team’s soccer World Cup opener against Portugal today.  
 The Chelsea striker broke his right arm playing in a June 4
tune-up match against Japan and will wear a lightweight cast
should he play in the match in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
Kickoff is 4 p.m. local time.  
 FIFA spokesman Nicolas Maingot told reporters in
Johannesburg that match referee Jorge Larrionda and Portuguese
officials had examined the cast and were satisfied that it
doesn’t pose a danger to other players.
