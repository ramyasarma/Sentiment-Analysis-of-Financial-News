             Pride International Inc. and Rowan
Cos. are “attractive” merger and acquisition candidates, Scott
Gruber, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Co., wrote in a
report today.  
 Gruber cited lower rig-rental rates because of the U.S.’s
moratorium on drilling. Rates are down 33 percent in deep water
and 45 percent in mid-water, he wrote.
