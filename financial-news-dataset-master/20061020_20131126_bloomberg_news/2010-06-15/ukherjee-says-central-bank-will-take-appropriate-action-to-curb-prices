             The Reserve Bank of India will take
“appropriate” action to control inflation as prices are an
“area of concern,” Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in
New Delhi. Sufficient monsoon rains will help cool prices and
inflation will start slowing from mid-June, and the government
is aiming to raise 3.13 trillion rupees in indirect taxes in the
financial year ending March 31, he said.
