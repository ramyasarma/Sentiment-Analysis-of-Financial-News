             Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  may
reduce steel prices by as much as 400 riyals ($106) to 2,500
riyals per ton, al-Hayat reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the company.  
 Sabic, the largest producer of steel in Saudi Arabia,
decided to reduce its prices after imported steel prices from
China and Turkey fell down this month, the newspaper said.  
 Sabic raised the price of steel in April, increasing the
metal’s price by 32 percent, to 2,900 riyals ($773) per metric
ton in Riyadh.
