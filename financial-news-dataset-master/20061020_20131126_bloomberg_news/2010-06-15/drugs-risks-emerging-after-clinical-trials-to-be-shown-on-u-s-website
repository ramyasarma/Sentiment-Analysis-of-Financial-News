             Doctors and patients will be able to
track drugs’ safety on an Internet-based system introduced today
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the result of law
aimed at reducing injuries and deaths from adverse effects.  
 The agency will review approved prescription medicines
after they reach the market to provide “early detection” of
any risks or adverse effects that weren’t identified in trials,
 Gerald Dal Pan , director of the FDA’s  Office of Surveillance and
Epidemiology , said today in a statement. The FDA will summarize
the findings on a page that will be added to its website today.  
 The reviews are required under a 2007 law that gave the FDA
more power to police approved medications. Lawmakers had
questioned the agency’s performance in handling Vioxx, the  Merck
& Co.  painkiller withdrawn worldwide in 2004 after being linked
to heart attacks and strokes, and  GlaxoSmithKline  Plc’s diabetes
pill Avandia, linked in studies to a risk of heart attacks.
While drugmakers must complete clinical safety trials as part of
the FDA approval process, adverse effects may not become
apparent until medicines are used more widely, the FDA said in
its statement.  
 “These summaries will provide clear and useful information
in a timely manner that can be used by providers and patients to
make informed decisions about an individual’s health,” Robert
Ball, director of the FDA’s Office of Biostatistics and
Epidemiology, said in the statement.  
 The agency, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, will
summarize what it learns about the safety of products 18 months
after they have been approved or after at least 10,000 patients
have used them, whichever occurs later. The first reports will
focus on drugs and biologics cleared since September 2007,
including medications for infections, hypertension and
depression, the FDA said.
