             Reliance Communications Ltd.,
India’s second-largest wireless carrier, rose as much as 5.1
percent in Mumbai trading after saying it plans to separate its
mobile-phone tower unit to repay debt.  
 The company, controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani is in
“advanced talks” with local and overseas companies for a cash
and stock transaction for Reliance Infratel Ltd., according to
an e-mailed statement yesterday.
