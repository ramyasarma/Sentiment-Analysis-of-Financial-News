             Natixis SA doesn’t need to raise new
capital to meet Basel 3 requirements, Chief Executive Officer
Laurent Mignon told French daily La Tribune in an interview.  
 The current uncertain economic environment means that now
may not be the best time for Natixis to sell its Coface credit-
insurance unit, Mignon told the newspaper.
