             Northam Platinum Ltd. said it
increased the capital expenditure on its Booysendal project to
3.6 billion rand from 3.1 billion rand after redesigning the
mine.  
 The company completed an “optimization exercise” at
Booysendal, which indicated that the start-up production can be
accelerated, that production rate can be higher than prior
estimates and at a lower cost, Northam said.
