             Gulf Navigation Holding PJSC, a
Dubai-based oil-tanker owner, said its unit received full refund
from SLS Shipbuilding Co. after it cancelled a contract to build
a chemical tanker because of delays.  
 Gulf Mizhar Shipping Inc received more than $35 million in
refund, the company said in a statement to the Dubai bourse
today. Gulf Mishref Shipping Inc., another unit of Gulf
Navigation, received reimbursement of $35 million from
Tongyeong, South Korea-based SLS Shipbuilding for a separate
tanker contract that was canceled because of delays, Gulf
Navigation said on June 8.  
 “Now having received its full payment with interest for
both vessels, the company is in a strong position to execute new
purchases at current market rates significantly lower than
before,” it said. “The refund of the interest-bearing
installments will have a positive effect on the company’s
result, and increase its cash reserves to help with future
acquisitions.”
