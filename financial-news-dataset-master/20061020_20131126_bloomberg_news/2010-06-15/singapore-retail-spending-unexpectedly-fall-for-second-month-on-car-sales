             Singapore’s retail sales
unexpectedly dropped for a second month as car purchases
plunged, offsetting higher spending at department stores.  
 The  retail sales index  fell 2.6 percent in April from a
year earlier, matching the decline in March, the Statistics
Department said today. The median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 0.8 percent gain. Excluding
motor vehicles, retail sales rose 7.4 percent from a year
earlier, after a revised 7 percent increase in March.  
 Singapore controls pollution and congestion on its roads by
selling a limited number of permits every year for each category
of vehicles, and the prices of the licenses have climbed this
year. Retail sales excluding automobiles may continue to rise in
the coming months as Singapore’s two casino resorts attract more
tourists and an expanding economy boosts hiring.  
 “With the labor market strengthening and visitor arrivals
on the rise, we are seeing an improvement in retail sales when
you exclude motor vehicles,”  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at
Forecast Pte in Singapore, said before the report.  
 Singapore employers added more jobs than initially
estimated last quarter, pushing the  unemployment rate  to the
lowest level in almost two years, a report today showed. The
city state added 36,500 jobs in the three months through March
and the seasonally adjusted jobless rate fell to 2.2 percent.  
 Las Vegas Sands  
 Visitor arrivals are surging as resorts run by Las Vegas
Sands Corp. and  Genting Singapore Plc  attract tourists to their
roulette tables, shops and hotels. The number of tourists
entering Singapore rose 20.4 percent in April from a year
earlier.  
 Adjusted for seasonal factors, retail sales declined 2.2
percent from March, today’s report showed.  
 Vehicle sales fell 30.9 percent from a year earlier, while
purchases at gas stations gained 17.2 percent. Sales of food and
beverages declined 0.6 percent in April. Department-store sales
by companies including Metro Holdings Ltd. climbed 8.6 percent,
and supermarket sales rose 1.3 percent.  
 “Car sales were driven lower by a shortage of certificates
of entitlement,” said  Alvin Liew , an economist at Standard
Chartered Plc in Singapore.  
 The prices for some vehicle permits have more than doubled
since the end of December.
