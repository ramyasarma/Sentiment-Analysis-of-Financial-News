             Magna International Inc.’s plan to
end founder Frank Stronach’s control of the company through a
sale of his Class B stock is unfair to investors and should
be stopped, said the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada’s
main stock market regulator. The commission plans to hold a
hearing into its plan to block the sale on June 23, the
commission said in an e-mailed release.
