             Volkswagen AG  plans to cut the U.S.
price and increase the size of the Jetta compact car, its best-
selling model in the country, as the automaker aims to make its
U.S. operations profitable by 2013.  
 The revamped Jetta will be about 3.5 inches longer and
about $1,700 less than the current version when U.S. sales start
in October, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company said yesterday
in a statement. A hybrid version will sell in two years.  
 Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker, is shifting more
production to North America to help trim costs and compete with
small-car leaders  Toyota Motor Corp.  and Honda Motor Co.,  Stefan Jacoby , chief executive officer of VW’s U.S. unit, said
yesterday in an interview. The company is aiming to almost
double sales in the market by 2012, to 400,000 units for its
namesake brand, compared with 213,454 vehicles last year.  
 “Model by model, our lineup will be competitively priced
so that we will be able to compete in the American market,”
Jacoby said yesterday at a press briefing to introduce the car
in New York.  
 Moving more production to North America from Europe
provides Volkswagen with a hedge against currency fluctuations
and shaves costs, Jacoby said. He restated the company’s goal
for North American output to rise to 75 percent of sales in the
region by 2013 from about 60 percent last year.  
 Profitable in U.S.  
 Volkswagen will be completely independent of the euro-
dollar exchange rate by 2012 or 2013, and the U.S. business will
be profitable by then, Jacoby said. The German company, which
reported a profit of  960 million euros  ($1.18 billion) last
year, doesn’t break out results for the U.S., and Jacoby
declined to give specifics for how much the business lost in the
market last year.  
 Volkswagen plans to sell the 2011 Jetta for about $16,000,
down from the current base of $17,735. That would bring the
model closer to the starting prices of Toyota’s  Corolla  and
 Honda ’s  Civic , now $15,450 and $15,455, respectively, according
to the companies’ websites.  
 “They’re going after big-volume products,”  Jeff Schuster ,
executive director of global forecasting at market-research firm
J.D. Power & Associates in Troy, Michigan, said in a telephone
interview.  
 Hybrid Version  
 The hybrid Jetta will come to the U.S. in 2012, Toscan
Bennett, vice president for  product  marketing, said in an
interview. VW hasn’t chosen a battery supplier yet, he said.  
 Volkswagen reported U.S. sales of 46,173 Jetta sedans and
wagons in the five months through May, a 27 percent increase
from a year earlier. Sales rose 17 percent to 118,625 for the
Corolla and 9.9 percent to 107,127 for the Civic in the period.  
 If Volkswagen “can improve styling with more competitive
pricing, that combination should provide some lift to sales,”
Schuster said. He called the redesigned Jetta “more refined
from a styling standpoint, like it’s grown up a bit.”  
 Volkswagen is scheduled to open a plant next year in
Chattanooga, Tennessee, that will build a new midsize sedan the
company expects to name by early next year. The Jetta is
produced in the Puebla, Mexico, plant, which has capacity to
make 450,000 units after an expansion to the plant that has been
ongoing since July 2009, spokeswoman  Jill Bratina  said yesterday
in an e-mail.  
 ‘Aggressive’ Growth Strategy  
 Volkswagen “is engaged in an aggressive long-term growth
strategy” in the U.S. and wants to boost deliveries to 1
million vehicles by 2018,  David Geanacopoulos , executive vice
president of VW’s North American unit, said today at a briefing
in Berlin.  
 “We have a long way to go, but we’re off to a good
start,” Geanacopoulos said. “We’ve improved product quality.
We’re continuing to gain market share.”  
 Volkswagen’s American depositary receipts rose 41 cents, or
 2.4 percent , to $17.45 at 3:55 p.m. New York time in over-the-
counter trading. That would be the highest closing price since
May 13.  
 Volkswagen is considering bringing the Polo subcompact,
which is smaller than the Jetta, to the U.S., Jacoby said
yesterday. The company has sold 225,200 Polo cars worldwide in
through the first five months of the year, up 28 percent,
according to a June 11 news release.  
 J.D. Power is “fairly bullish” on Volkswagen’s U.S. sales
prospects, while setting its own estimate short of the German
carmaker’s 2012 goal, Schuster said.  
 “We’re forecasting sales in the 350,000 to 375,000
range,” he said. “If they hit a home run with these products,
their target is within range.”
