             South African bus drivers
transporting World Cup socer fans will return to work today
following an illegal strike which left some fans stranded at
Soccer City in Johannesburg yesterday, the South African Press
Association reported.  
 Clidet, which operates the Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit
service in the city, reached an agreement with the South African
Municipal Workers Union on how shifts, overtime and allowances
would be paid during the month-long tournament, the
Johannesburg-based news service said, citing Jackie Huntley, the
chief executive officer of Clidet.
