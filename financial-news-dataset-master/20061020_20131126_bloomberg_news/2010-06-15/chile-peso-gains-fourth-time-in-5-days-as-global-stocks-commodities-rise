             Chile’s peso strengthened for the
fourth time in five days as global stocks and commodities rose.  
 The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 535.05 per dollar from
537.43 yesterday.  
 The  MSCI World Index  rose 1.3 percent to 1,105.78 after
growth in New York manufacturing indicated the global economy is
weathering the European debt crisis. Chile’s  IPSA Index  of most-
traded stocks reached a record of 4,019.93 and the
 Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities gained for a
seventh day.  
 “This is a lower risk-aversion trade,” said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. “The U.S.
has been recovering more strongly than expected in recent
months, and we expect the Chinese government to engineer a soft
landing.”  
 Chile’s central bank will today raise its benchmark
interest rate a quarter-percentage point to 0.75 percent, the
highest level since July, according to the median forecast of 24
economists in a Bloomberg  survey .
