             Italy Coach  Marcello Lippi 
criticized journalists for asking about the Northern League
radio station’s support of Paraguay at a press conference
following yesterday’s World Cup match.  
 Commentator at  Radio Padania Libera , owned by Italy’s anti-
immigration Northern League political party, cheered when
Paraguay scored against Italy. “Here we go! Paraguay scored!”
said the radio announcer Roberto Ortelli after Antolin Alcaraz
gave Paraguay a 39th-minute lead in the Group F opener.  
 Italian journalists asked Lippi after the match, which
ended 1-1, to comment on the radio station’s commentary. “I
don’t care anything about this,” the coach said. “ You don’t
even have to talk about this after a World Cup match.”  
 Italy’s Captain  Fabio Cannavaro  later told reporters:
“Don’t make me talk about Padania.”  
 The Northern League is Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s biggest ally and has three ministers in the
government including Interior Minister Roberto Maroni.
