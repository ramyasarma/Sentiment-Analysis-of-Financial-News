             Hertz Global Holdings Inc. , which
agreed in April to buy Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. for
$1.3 billion, said it received a second request yesterday from
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for documents and information.  
 “We don’t see this as a negative sign and we still expect
to complete the transaction that we negotiated with Dollar
Thrifty,”  Richard Broome , a spokesman for Park Ridge, New
Jersey-based Hertz, said.  
 Hertz offered $41 a share and faces a possible bidding war
with Avis Budget Group Inc. for Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar
Thrifty. Avis has said it plans a “substantially higher offer”
and has signed a confidentiality agreement to examine Dollar
Thrifty’s financial information.  
 The small number of car-rental companies and high-profile
nature of the acquisition made a second request likely, said
Stephen Calkins, a former general counsel at the FTC who is a
professor at Wayne State University’s law school in Detroit.  
 “It’s never good news to get a second request, but it’s
not terribly surprising considering the prominence of the
companies involved,” Calkins said in an interview.  
 The FTC’s examination of the acquisition doesn’t
 mean the agency will challenge it in court, he said.  
 “I don’t think you can draw any conclusions,” he said.  
 Avis said May 3 the antitrust approval prospects for it
acquiring Dollar Thrifty are “comparable” to those of the
Hertz proposal. The company said today it also received a second
trade commission request.
