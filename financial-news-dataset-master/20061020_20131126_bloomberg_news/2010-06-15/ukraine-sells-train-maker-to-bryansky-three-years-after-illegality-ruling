             Ukraine resold  VAT Luhanskteplovoz ,
the country’s biggest train producer, to Russian ZAO Bryanskiy
Mashynostroitelnyi Zavod, the company that acquired the
locomotive maker three years ago and then was ordered to return
it to the government.  
 The state property fund sold a 76 percent stake in
 Luhanskteplovoz  to Bryanskiy Zavod at an auction today in Kiev
for 410 million hryvnia ($51.8 million), while the announced
starting price was set at 400 million hryvnia. Ukrainian Frunze
Sumy NPO company also participated in the bids.  
 The government of then-Prime Minister  Viktor Yanukovych 
sold the train maker, based in the eastern Ukrainian city of
Luhansk, to Bryanskiy Zavod in March 2007 for $58 million. Three
months later, a court ruled illegal the state property fund’s
sale and ordered the stake returned.  
 “I think that the plant should have cost more,” said
Oleksandr Ryabchenko, the head of the fund, told journalists
after the auction. “We expected the price to climb to 500
million hryvnia.”  
 Ukraine’s government wants to receive 10 billion hryvnia
from state assets sale this year, according to the state budget.
