             Chile’s Mining Minister  Laurence Golborne  urged Congress to approve today proposed changes in
mining royalty laws after some senators rejected the motion.  
 Opposition senators on the finance committee of congress
rejected a clause in the bill yesterday that would leave taxes
unchanged for mining companies between 2013 and 2020, according
to the Senate website.  
 The government of President  Sebastian Pinera , which took
office in March, is seeking to introduce an optional sliding tax
rate on profit of between 4 percent and 9 percent. The new rate,
which would provide $700 million in additional revenue next year
and in 2012, will help the government pay for damages caused by
a Feb. 27 earthquake that damaged central and southern Chile.  
 The bill “is very convenient for the country because it
doesn’t hurt investment and it allows the government to cash in
when economic cycles are benefiting miners,” Golborne told
reporters in Santiago today.  
 The tax increase will provide enough additional revenue in
the next two years to build 50,000 houses for residents who
became homeless during the earthquake, Golborne said.  
 Mining companies will likely reject the tax increase if the
clause that extends existing terms for miners between 2013 and
2020 is removed, he said. The new rate would be reinstated in
2020, according to proposed legislation.  
 Chile was struck by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in
February, the fifth-largest recorded in the world in the last
century.
