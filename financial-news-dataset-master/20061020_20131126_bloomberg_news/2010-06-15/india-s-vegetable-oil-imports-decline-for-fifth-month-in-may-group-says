             Vegetable oil imports by India, the
world’s biggest consumer after China, fell for a fifth straight
month in May as buyers ran down inventories.  
 Purchases declined 26 percent to 558,765 metric tons, from
751,097 tons a year earlier, the Solvent Extractors’  Association 
of India said today in an e-mailed statement. Stockpiles totaled
1.075 million tons as at June 1, down from 1.225 million tons on
May 1, the group said.  
 “Consumption has not gone down, the stock has gone down,”
B.V. Mehta, executive director of the association, said by phone
from Mumbai. “Now we are entering the lean crushing period, I
am expecting imports to go up in the next four to five months.”  
 India bought 314,581 tons of crude palm oil in May, down 29
percent from a year earlier, the association said. Purchases of
soybean oil climbed to 110,150 tons, from 48,102 tons a year ago,
as the edible oil’s premium over rival palm oil narrowed.  
 Soybean oil in Chicago dropped for the first time in six
days, shedding 0.2 percent to 37.3 cents a pound at 1:10 p.m.
Mumbai time. That pared the premium over palm oil to 26 percent
below the 12-month average, according to data on the Bloomberg.  
 Palm oil for August delivery dropped as much as 1 percent
to 2,386 ringgit ($729) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and traded at 2,389 ringgit at 1:19 p.m. Mumbai time.  
 Edible oil inventories as at June 1 at various Indian ports
totaled 550,000 tons, the association said. It didn’t provide a
year-ago number. Total imports in the November-to-May period
declined 4 percent, the group said.  
 India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil.
