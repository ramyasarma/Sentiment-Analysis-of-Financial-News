             Apple Inc.  and AT&T Inc., which
began taking preorders for a new version of the iPhone today,
are struggling to handle demand at their retail and online
outlets, according to customers and store representatives.  
 At Apple stores in San Francisco and New York, the staff
recommended that customers try ordering the device from Apple’s
website later today or tomorrow. Some calls to Apple’s customer-
service line also aren’t getting through because of high volume.  
 Apple Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  unveiled the
fourth-generation iPhone earlier this month, showing off a
thinner smartphone with a sharper screen that can make video
calls. The iPhone has become Apple’s top-selling product,
accounting for 40 percent of  revenue  last quarter.  
 “We expect presale activity to be very strong for the new
iPhone,”  Ben Reitzes , an analyst at Barclays Capital in New
York, said in a report today. He expects the company to sell 8.1
million iPhones in the quarter ending June 26.  
 The iPhone 4, which starts at $199, goes on sale in the
U.S. on June 24. That price requires a two-year service contract
with  AT&T , the device’s exclusive carrier in the U.S.  
 Apple , which will offer both black and white models of the
new handset, said today that customers can’t preorder the white
version. It also won’t be available in stores on June 24.  
 Black Only  
 “At launch, we have the black models available for
purchase and we will be adding the white models as quickly as we
can,” said  Natalie Harrison , a spokeswoman for the Cupertino,
California-based company. “There is tremendous excitement for
the new iPhone 4, and we are working to get as many of them into
the hands of customers as possible.”  
 Mark Siegel , a spokesman for Dallas-based AT&T, declined to
comment.  
 Shoppers trying to preorder the phone are having trouble
completing transactions online and are experiencing long waits
at some stores, according to customer reports on
AppleInsider.com, Engadget.com and Gizmodo.com.  
 The iPhone 4 comes to market as Apple faces mounting
competition from  Google Inc. , whose Android mobile-operating
software runs handsets from HTC Corp. and Motorola Inc.  
 Apple rose $5.41 to $259.69 at 4 p.m. New York time in
 Nasdaq Stock Market   trading . The shares have advanced 23 percent
this year.
