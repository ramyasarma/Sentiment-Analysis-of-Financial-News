             The Dubai prosecutor’s office
released  Hashim Al Dabal , the ex-chairman of state-owned Dubai
Properties LLC, after he made a payment of 130 million dirhams
($35.4 million) following an embezzlement investigation.  
 Al Dabal is still being investigated for abuse of power,
according to an e-mailed statement from the government’s media
office today. He was arrested last year on suspicion of fraud at
the company, the emirate’s attorney general said on Oct. 30.  
 Dubai began an investigation in 2008 into corruption at
real-estate and other state companies, which benefited from
economic expansion fueled by real-estate demand after foreigners
were allowed to buy property for the first time.  
 In May,  Omar bin Sulaiman , the former governor of the
Dubai International Financial Center, was released from prison
after he returned 51.5 million dirhams. Bin Sulaiman, who was
dismissed by Dubai ruler  Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid  Al Maktoum
in November and arrested in March, is the highest-ranking
official to be caught up in the anti-corruption drive started
after the emirate’s boom-to-bust.
