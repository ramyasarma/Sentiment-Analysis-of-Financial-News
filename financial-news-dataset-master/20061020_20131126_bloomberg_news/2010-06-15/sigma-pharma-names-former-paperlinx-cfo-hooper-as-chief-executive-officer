             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , the
target of a takeover bid from Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.,
named a former chief financial officer to its top job after
posting a record loss.  
 Mark Hooper , who was the head of finance while Sigma’s
profit rose fourfold from 2001 to 2006, will start as chief
executive officer in September, the Melbourne-based company said
in a statement today. He rejoins a company that has had three
top managers leave and whose market value has fallen by half
since the loss was announced on March 31.  
 Hooper could improve Sigma’s business, potentially sparking
a higher offer from Aspen, analysts at UBS AG said. Durban,
South Africa-based  Aspen , the continent’s largest drug company,
offered on May 21 to buy Sigma’s outstanding shares for 60
Australian cents each, or a total of A$708 million ($612
million), and assume net  debt  of A$785 million.  
 “With leadership, SIP can more effectively seek refinance
in order to continue to trade as a standalone company which
could, in turn, create price tension in the existing offer from
Aspen,”  Andrew Goodsall  and  Dan Hurren , Sydney-based analysts
at UBS, wrote in a note to clients today. They are maintaining
their “neutral”  rating  on Sigma and predict the shares will
trade at 48 Australian cents in 12 months.  
 Sigma rose 3.1 percent, the most since May 31, to close at
49.5 Australian cents in Sydney trading. The S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 1.2 percent.  
 Record Drop  
 The stock fell by a record on March 31, erasing A$513
million from its market value, after the company posted a full-
year loss of A$389 million. Revenue increased 4.5 percent to
A$3.22 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Elmo de Alwis  announced his
resignation two weeks later, Chief Financial Officer  Mark Smith 
quit May 13, and Chairman  John Stocker  said May 20 he planned to
retire.  
 “Our view is that Mr. Hooper is very well regarded in the
pharmacy industry,” the UBS analysts wrote. “New leadership
will likely limit market share losses from customers who may
have been concerned” about Sigma’s future, they said.  
 Hooper is now chief financial officer of  PaperlinX Ltd. ,
according to Sigma’s statement. Melbourne-based PaperlinX is
Australia’s largest paper manufacturer.  
 Sigma posted  net income  of A$73 million in 2006, rising
from A$16.81 million in 2001, according to data on its website.
Sales climbed to A$2.17 billion from A$1.52 billion in the
period.
