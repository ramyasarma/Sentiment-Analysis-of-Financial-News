             Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit hired two traders for its European power and natural
gas desk, SparkSpread said yesterday on its website, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Noelia Lopez will join Merrill as a power trader for
southern Europe after eight years at Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
where she mainly traded the Spanish market. She will report to
Fjodor Duschek, head of continental power trading, the energy
news website said.  
 Simon Thies, now at GDF Suez, will join Merrill as a short-
term gas trader reporting to  Andy Job , head of gas trading,
SparkSpread said.  
 Merrill Lynch spokesman  Andrew Todd  didn’t reply to a voice
mail message seeking comment.
