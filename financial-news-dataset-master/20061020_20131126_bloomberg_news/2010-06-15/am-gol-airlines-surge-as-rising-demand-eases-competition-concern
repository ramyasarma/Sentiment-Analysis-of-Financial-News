             Tam SA  and  Gol Linhas Aereas
Inteligentes SA  jumped the most in at least six months after a
report said air travel by Brazilian carriers grew 20 percent,
easing concern higher competition will spur lower prices.  
 Tam, Brazil’s second-biggest airline after Gol, surged 8
percent to 26.90 reais, the biggest jump since December. Gol
climbed 7.8 percent to 22.99 reais, its biggest gain since
November.  
 “While there has been considerable speculation and media
buzz regarding a potential domestic price war, our most recent
conversations with management suggest a relatively healthy June
thus far, with domestic yields actually trending higher versus
May,” wrote Banco BTG Pactual analyst  Rodrigo Goes  in a note to
clients today.  
 Brazilian airlines increased travel 20.4 percent in May
from a year earlier, the National Agency of Civic Aviation said
yesterday in Brasilia.  
 Tam sank 30 percent this year, while Gol dropped 12 percent
on concern rising competition within Brazil from Azul Linhas
Aereas Brasileiras, Webjet Linhas Aereas, Oceanair Linhas Aereas
Ltda. will force carriers to lower prices to not lose market
share.  
 In the domestic market, Tam held 40.88 percent in May,
while Gol had a 40.18 percent market share, according to the
Anac, as the agency is known. Azul Linhas had a market share of
5.93 percent, while Webjet had 6.26 percent and OceanAir held
3.17 percent.
