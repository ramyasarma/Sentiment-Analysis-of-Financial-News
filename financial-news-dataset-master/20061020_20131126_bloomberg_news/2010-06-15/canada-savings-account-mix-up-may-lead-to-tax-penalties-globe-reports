             Confusion among investors, financial
firms and the Canadian government may leave as many as 70,000
people with a tax bill for over-contributing to their tax-free
savings accounts, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 The accounts, introduced in January 2009, allow people to
contribute up to C$5,000 ($4,856) per year, the newspaper said.  
 However, rules around timing for putting money back into
the accounts have led to confusion, resulting in some people
receiving penalties of “several hundred dollars” for over
contributing, the Globe said.
