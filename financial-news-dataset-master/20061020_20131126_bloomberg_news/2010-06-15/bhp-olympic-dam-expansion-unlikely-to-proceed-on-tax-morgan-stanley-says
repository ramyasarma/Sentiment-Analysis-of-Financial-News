             Expansion at  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s 
Olympic Dam mine, the world’s largest uranium deposit, is
unlikely to proceed because of the Australian government’s
planned mine profit tax, Morgan Stanley said.  
 “Our modeling of this project shows that the resources
super profits tax reduces the net present value of the project
to an extent that it becomes negative,” analyst  Craig Campbell 
said today in a report. The expansion may cost between $20
billion and $40 billion, he said.  
 Australia’s Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd  plans to introduce a
40 percent tax from 2012 on mine profits. BHP’s Chief Executive
Officer  Marius Kloppers  said last month that expansion plans,
including Olympic Dam, may be “very difficult” to approve
because of the tax plan.  
 Expanding the mine would take 11 years and would increase
copper output almost fourfold to 750,000 metric tons a year,
boost gold production eightfold and uranium by almost fivefold,
according to Melbourne-based BHP, the world’s biggest mining
company.
