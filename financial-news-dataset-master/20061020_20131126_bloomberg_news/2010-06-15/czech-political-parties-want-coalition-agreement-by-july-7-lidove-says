             Three Czech political parties, who
pledged to cut the budget deficit, want to have an agreement on
the ruling coalition by July 7,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing
the leaders of the parties.  
 The parties want to agree on the government makeup by July
10 so that the new Cabinet can start shaping next year’s budget
before July 15, the newspaper quoted  Petr Necas , the leader of
the Civic Democratic Party, as saying.
