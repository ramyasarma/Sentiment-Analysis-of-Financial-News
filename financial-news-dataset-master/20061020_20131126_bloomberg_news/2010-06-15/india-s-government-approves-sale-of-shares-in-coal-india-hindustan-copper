             India’s cabinet approved the sale of
10 percent stakes in Coal India Ltd. and  Hindustan Copper Ltd. 
as part of its plan to reduce holdings in state-run companies.  
 The government will sell a 10 percent stake in Coal India,
the nation’s monopoly producer, Corporate Affairs Minister
 Salman Khurshid , said by phone today from New Delhi, after
cabinet approved the sale at a meeting. The government will also
sell a 10 percent stake in Kolkata-based Hindustan Copper
followed by a company offering of a further 10 percent, Khurshid
said. The shares rose as much as 14 percent.  
 “We hope to complete the share sale process by
September,”  Shakeel Ahmed , chairman at Hindustan Copper, said
in a phone interview after the government approval.  
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants to raise 400 billion
rupees ($8.6 billion) in the year ending March 31 selling shares
in one state-run company almost every month. The government said
in January it may sell shares in 60 companies to shrink its
budget deficit to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product this
fiscal year from 6.9 percent last year.  
 Hindustan Copper’s shares rose as much as 67.75 rupees to
537.7 rupees in Mumbai trading, the most since May 31. They
traded at 526.55 rupees at 11:27 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Sensitive Index fell 0.2 percent.
