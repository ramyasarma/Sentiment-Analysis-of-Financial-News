             A low-pressure system brewing in the
mid-Atlantic is unlikely to intensify enough to become the
season’s first tropical storm, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.  
 The  system , 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) east of the
Lesser Antilles, has a 50 percent chance of building into a
tropical cyclone in the next two days, according to the Miami-
based center. The first developed system of the hurricane season
that runs from June through November will be called Alex.  
 “Environmental conditions are expected to remain
marginally favorable for this system to become a tropical
depression today before upper-level winds become less favorable
on Wednesday,” the center said at 2 a.m. local time.  
 The 2010 Atlantic storm season has gained added
significance this year because storms can head into the Gulf of
Mexico, where they may complicate BP Plc’s efforts to cap a
leaking offshore oil well.  
 A tropical depression becomes a named storm once winds
exceed 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour).
