             South African Reserve Bank Deputy 
Governor Renosi Mokate won’t renew her five-year contract when 
it expires on July 31, the Pretoria-based central bank said in 
a statement posted on its website today.  
 The decision was reached by mutual agreement following 
consultation between the Reserve Bank’s board and President 
Jacob Zuma, the central bank said. Zuma will “in due course” 
advise the central bank on who he has decided to appoint as the
next deputy Governor, it said.
