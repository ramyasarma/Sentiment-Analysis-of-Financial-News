             Greek government bonds led a decline
of peripheral euro-region debt including Portugal and Spain
after the nation’s credit ranking was cut to junk by Moody’s
Investors Service.  
 Investors demanded an extra 6.08 percentage points, or 608
basis points, to hold 10-year Greek securities instead of
benchmark German bunds, the most since May 10, when the European
Central Bank began buying the debt of some nations in the
region. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said Greece’s debt will
be removed from some indexes following the four-step reduction
yesterday. Bunds declined, erasing earlier gains. Ireland and
Spain sold securities at higher yields than at earlier auctions.  
 “There’s a lot of forced selling as Greek bonds fall out
of indexes and if you’ve got to sell, you’ve got to sell,” said
 Harvinder Sian , a senior bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London. “The European Central Bank is the
only buyer for peripherals as contagion takes hold.”  
 The Greek 10-year bond yield jumped 85 basis points to 9.42
percent as of 2:05 p.m. in London. The 6.25 percent security due
June 2020 slid 4.8, or 48 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,225) face
amount, to 79.9.  
 Greece’s credit classification was reduced to Ba1 from A3
by Moody’s, which cited  ‘substantial” risks to economic growth
from austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($135
billion) aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund.  
 Spreads Widen  
 The bund yield climbed two basis points to 2.66 percent,
after falling to 2.58 percent. Two-year yields rose 1 basis
point, to 0.51 percent.  
 The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10-year
Portuguese securities and bunds widened 19 basis points to 278
basis points, the most in a week, with the Spanish-German spread
increased one basis point to 205 basis points, according to
Bloomberg generic data.  
 The lower rating “incorporates a greater, albeit, low risk
of default,” Moody’s said in a statement accompanying the Greek
downgrade yesterday. The outlook is stable, it said.  
 Greek credit swaps signal a 48 percent probability the
nation will default within five years after. The cost of
insuring $10 million of Greece’s bonds for five years jumped
$43,500 to $799,000 a year, making the nation’s debt the third
most expensive to protect after Venezuela and Argentina,
according to CMA DataVision.  
 Bond Indexes  
 Citigroup said Greek debt will be removed from the World
Government Bond Index, the EMU Government Bond Index and the
World Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index by the end of June.
Greek bonds will also be removed from Barclays’ Global Aggregate
and Global Treasury indexes. Investors who have a mandate to
track an index in their funds may be forced to sell an asset
when it’s removed from the gauge.  
 “There are currently 23 Greek government bonds in the June
2010 WGBI profile, comprising a total $213.6 billion in market
value, and representing 1.34 percent of the overall WGBI,”
Citigroup said in a statement. It would take at least six months
for Greek bonds to be reinstated in indexes, the bank said.  
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.2287, erasing a decline to
as low as $1.2168.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index  of equities
advanced 0.4 percent.  
 “The market is realizing that the potential impact of the
Moody’s downgrade outside of peripheral Europe is not that
great,” said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche
Bank AG in London. “The risk aversion that we saw is
dissipating. There is a negative impact on Greece, but the
fallout for other assets classes is likely to be limited.”  
 Spending Cuts  
 Greece has cut spending, raised taxes and trimmed wages to
tackle the deficit, which swelled to 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product last year, more than four times the EU limit.
To secure the EU-IMF aid, the government pledged to trim the
shortfall to 8.1 percent of GDP this year and bring it back
under the 3 percent EU ceiling in 2014. The crisis has prompted
investors to sell the bonds of Greece and other high-deficit
nations and pushed the euro down 14 percent this year.  
 Bund yields touched the lowest since at least 1989 on June
8 amid speculation that weaker euro-region economies will be
overwhelmed by their debts, stoking demand for the perceived
safety of German fixed-income assets. The crisis has driven the
16-nation currency down 20 percent between last year’s high on
Nov. 25, 2009, and the end of last week.  
 Budget Cuts  
 Soaring bond yields in nations including Greece, Ireland
and Portugal also forced the EU to craft a 750 billion-euro
rescue package on May 10.  
 Spain and Portugal need additional budget cuts to meet
deficit targets announced a month ago even as their efforts to
tame their shortfalls threaten to choke growth and produce a
“snowball” effect on their debt levels, according to a draft
European Commission document.  
 The deficit-reduction measures announced by the two nations
as part of a European Union agreement on May 10 to create a 750
billion-euro ($920 billion) financial backstop for indebted
countries aren’t sufficient, the report obtained by Bloomberg
News said. Spain pledged to cut the EU’s third-highest deficit
to 9.3 percent of gross domestic product this year and to 6
percent in 2011. Portugal vowed to lower its shortfall to 7.3
percent of GDP in 2010 and to 4.6 percent in 2011.  
 The ECB increased its purchases of government bonds last
week. The Frankfurt-based central bank said yesterday it would
take term deposits today to mop up 47 billion euros of bond
purchases settled up to June 11. That indicates it bought 6.5
billion euros of bonds in the fifth week of its program.
Purchases slowed to 5.5 billion euros in the fourth week from
8.5 billion euros in the third, 10 billion euros in the second
and 16.5 billion euros in the first.  
 Bond Auctions  
 Spain’s borrowing costs rose at an auction of 12- and 18-
month bills in Madrid amid concern that the euro-region’s fiscal
crisis has yet to be contained.  
 The weighted average yield on 4.18 billion euros of the 12-
month securities was 2.303 percent, compared with 1.59 percent
last month, the Bank of Spain said. The 987.8 million euros of
18-month notes yielded 2.837 percent, compared with 1.951
percent on May 18.  
 Ireland sold 750 million euros of 4.5 percent 2018 notes at
an average yield of 5.09 percent, and a further 750 million
euros of 4.6 percent 2016 notes at an average yield of 4.52
percent. Belgium also auctioned bills.  
 Ireland’s economy is “set to turn the corner” after
shrinking about 10 percent in the last two years, an analyst at
Moody’s said yesterday.  
 “Ireland is a flexible, competitive economy, but is
vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth and liquidity drying
up,”  Dietmar Hornung , an analyst at Moody’s, said in an
interview in Dublin. “These are the big risks.”  
 German government bonds returned 6.7 percent this year,
compared with 4.4 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 4.6 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek
debt lost more than 11 percent, the indexes show.
