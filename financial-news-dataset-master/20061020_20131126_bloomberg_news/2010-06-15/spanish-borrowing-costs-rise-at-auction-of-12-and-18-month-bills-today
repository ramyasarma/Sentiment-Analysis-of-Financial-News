             Spain’s borrowing  costs  rose at an
auction of 12- and 18-month bills in Madrid amid concern that
the euro-region’s fiscal crisis has yet to be contained.  
 The weighted average yield on 4.18 billion euros ($5.1
billion) of the 12-month securities was 2.303 percent, compared
with 1.59 percent last month, the Bank of Spain said. The 987.78
million euros of 18-month notes yielded 2.837 percent, compared
with 1.951 percent on May 18.  
 Spain, with the third-largest  budget deficit  in the euro
region, is facing higher financing costs as investors doubt the
government’s capacity to reduce spending. A selloff of debt from
so-called peripheral countries accelerated after Greece’s credit
rating was cut to non-investment grade, or junk, by Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday.  
 The extra yield  investors  demand to hold Spanish 10-year
debt instead of benchmark German bunds stood at 209 basis points
as of 10:54 a.m. in Madrid. On June 8 it reached a euro-era
intraday record of 215.6 basis points.  
 Investors bid for 1.49 times the amount of 12-month bills
on offer. The so-called bid-to-cover ratio was 3.51 for the 18-
month notes. The sale met the range of 5 billion euros to 6
billion euros for today’s auction targeted by the nation’s
Treasury.
