             Chile’s  benchmark equity index  rose
to a record, exceeding 4,000 points for the first time, on
speculation that strengthening domestic spending and global
export demand will drive company earnings growth.  
 The Ipsa rose for a sixth day, gaining 1.3 percent to
4,037.44 at 4:26 p.m. The gauge is up 5.2 percent in the last
month while the MSCI EM Latin America index rose 1.4 percent.  
 Chile’s economic activity expanded 8.6 percent in April
from March, the biggest increase since 1996, as the economy
recovers from February’s earthquake, the central bank said last
week. Consumer spending surged 22 percent in the year through
April before the World Cup soccer tournament, according to the
national statistics institute.  
 “The good macroeconomic data is pushing up the market,”
 Javier Brstilo , who helps manage $5 billion at BCI
Administradora de Fondos Mutuos SA in Santiago, said today by
telephone.  
 Chile’s private pension funds, which had $117 billion in
assets at the end of May, were net buyers of Chilean stocks
during the month, for the first time this year, according to
Banchile Inversiones estimates distributed in a June 11 note.
