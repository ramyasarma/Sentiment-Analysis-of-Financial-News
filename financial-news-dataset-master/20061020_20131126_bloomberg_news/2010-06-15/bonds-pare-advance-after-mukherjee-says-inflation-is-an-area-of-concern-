             India’s 10-year bonds pared gains
after Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said inflation remains
an “area of concern” and that the central bank will take
“appropriate” action to contain price increases. The yield on
the 7.8 percent note due 2020 was at 7.66 percent as of 1:26
p.m. in Mumbai, after falling as low as 7.59 percent earlier,
according to the central bank’s trading system.
