             Dubai World’s loans have a fair
value of 44 to 46 cents to the dollar after the state-owned
company altered terms on $14.4 billion of bank debt, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said.  
 JPMorgan estimated the fair value of Dubai World’s $4.4
billion of Tranche A debt at 58 to 61 cents and $10 billion of
Tranche B debt at 36 to 41 cents, according to an e-mailed
report today.  
 “The steep discounts from face value mostly reflect the
below market cash interest of 1-2 percent being proposed by
Dubai World on both tranches,” London-based analyst Zafar Nazim
wrote in the report.
