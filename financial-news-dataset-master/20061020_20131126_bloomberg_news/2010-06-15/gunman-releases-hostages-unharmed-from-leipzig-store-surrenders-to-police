             A possibly armed man who stormed an
H&M store in the eastern German city of Leipzig and took
hostages released his captives unhurt and surrendered to police.  
 The man, who wasn’t identified, had taken about 10 hostages
before leaving an undetermined number of people go, Leipzig
police department spokesman Uwe Voigt said today by phone. The
authorities are investigating witness reports that he was
carrying a handgun or an object that resembled a firearm.   
 The man may have sought publicity, Voigt said.   
 “Apparently he wanted to talk to the press because he felt
he had been badly treated by a doctor,” the spokesman said.   
 Police had received calls from customers at the H&M store
shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time and began sealing off large
swathes of Leipzig’s inner city, Deutsche Presse-Agentur
reported earlier.
