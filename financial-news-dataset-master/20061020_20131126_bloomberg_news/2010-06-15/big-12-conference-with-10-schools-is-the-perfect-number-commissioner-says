             The  Big 12  Conference will stand pat
at 10 schools and may consider changing its name, Commissioner
 Dan Beebe  said.  
 The conference staved off collapse yesterday when the
University of Texas, Texas A&M University, the University of
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University committed to remain in
the now 10-team conference.  
 The University of Nebraska will join the Big Ten Conference
in 2011, and the University of Colorado will join the Pacific-10
Conference in 2012.  
 “We are not looking to expand at all,” Beebe said on a
conference call with reporters. “We’re very comfortable with
where we are. There is no interest in having an expansion review
at this point and I don’t think it’s going to come in the
future.”  
 The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  requires
conferences to have 12 teams with two divisions if they want to
stage a football championship game. The Big 12 could petition
the NCAA to hold a championship with 10 teams, but Beebe said
he’s not sure he wants to.  
 Although the conference will lose the revenue that comes
with a championship game, Beebe said, there is no fear of having
a national-championship-caliber team knocked out of contention
with a loss in the conference title game.  
 The commissioner also said talks with university
administrators might be held on whether the conference name
should be changed to reflect the loss of the 11th and 12th
teams. He didn’t offer his personal opinion.
