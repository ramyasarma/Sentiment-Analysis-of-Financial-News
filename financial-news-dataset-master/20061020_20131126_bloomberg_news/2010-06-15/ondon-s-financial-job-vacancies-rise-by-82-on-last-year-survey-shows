             Job vacancies at London’s financial-
services companies rose 82 percent in the year through May as
firms rebuilt businesses hurt during the credit crisis.  
 The number of job vacancies in the City, as London’s main
financial district is known, and elsewhere in the British
capital rose to 5,733 in May from 3,150 a year earlier,
recruitment consultant Morgan McKinley said in a statement
today. Employment openings was 3 percent higher compared with
April, the survey showed.  
 “Hiring activity shows a gradual upward trajectory despite
the distractions of a change in government and the continuing
euro-zone issues,” according to  Andrew Evans , managing director
of Morgan McKinley’s financial services division. Economic
uncertainty in Europe and next week’s emergency Budget in
Britain meant it was difficult to predict further job growth,
Evans said.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will say in his
Mansion House speech later today that the emergency Budget on
June 22 will announce plans for a levy on banks, the Financial
Times reported today, without attribution.  
 Securities firms continue to hire as the  Office for
National Statistics  said today that unemployment in the three
months to April slipped to 2.47 million people from 2.51
million.  
 ‘Significant Upside’  
 Nomura Holdings Inc. has been adding to its fixed income
team in London following its acquisition of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. ’s European units in 2008, while accounting firm
KPMG aims to recruit 300 consultants starting this year, The
Times newspaper in London reported on Feb. 1.  
 Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-largest bank by assets,
hired 750 bankers in Europe and Asia last year. The bank
reported a 29 percent rise in first-quarter profit for 2010.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank by
market value, plans to hire more than 130 sales people at its
investment bank this year,  David Mathers , chief operating
officer of the investment bank, told a conference in March.  
 “There is still significant upside potential in many of our
businesses,” he said.  
 Average City salaries rose 9 percent in May from the
previous month to 55,353 pounds ($81,502), the survey showed.  
 The rise in vacancies follows a 12 percent drop in
financial services job vacancies in April, Morgan McKinley said.
