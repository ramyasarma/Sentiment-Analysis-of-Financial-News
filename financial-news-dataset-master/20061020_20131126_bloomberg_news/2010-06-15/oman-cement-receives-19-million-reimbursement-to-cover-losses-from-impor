             Oman Cement Co., the sultanate’s
second-largest maker of the building material by market value,
received 7.34 million rials ($19 million) from the Ministry of
Finance as part of reimbursement to cover its losses in import
of cement and clinker in 2008 and 2009.  
 Oman Cement incurred losses on the sale of imported cement
and clinker procured under directives of the government to
provide cement to the customers at low prices, the company said
in a statement to the Muscat bourse today. The reimbursement
will have a positive effect on the profitability of the company
in the current quarter and the year ended Dec. 31, it said.
