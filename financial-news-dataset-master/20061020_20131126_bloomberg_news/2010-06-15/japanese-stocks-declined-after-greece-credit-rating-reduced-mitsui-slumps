             Japanese  benchmark stock indexes 
climbed for the fourth day as upgrades on automakers and
brokerages overcame concerns a reduction of Greece’s credit
rating will slow the global economic recovery.  
 Nissan Motor Co.  jumped 3.3 percent after Japan’s second-
largest automaker was raised to “outperform” from “neutral”
at Macquarie Group Ltd. Nomura Holdings Inc. climbed 1.9 percent
after Japan’s biggest brokerage was raised at Credit Suisse
Group AG because of low valuations.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. ,
which counts Europe as its biggest market, lost 0.8 percent,
after Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s debt rating to junk.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.1 percent to
9,887.89 at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo after falling as
much as 0.5 percent. The broader  Topix  index gained less than
0.1 percent to 878.83, with eight stocks falling for every seven
that rose. Shares in the Topix have a price-to-book value of
1.06, the lowest among the world’s 10-biggest markets.  
 “In terms of valuations, it’s not strange for shares to
rise,” said  Yoshinori?Nagano , a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Asset Management Co. which oversees the equivalent
of $94 billion. “People are reluctant to invest in risk assets
because it’s still uncertain how big the effect of fiscal
austerity measures in Europe will be.”  
 The Topix has decreased 3.2 percent this year, compared
with drops of 2.3 percent by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and
0.5 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 17 times estimated earnings,
compared with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.7 times for the
Stoxx.  
 Nissan, Toyota Rise  
 Carmakers advanced after the investment rating on  Nissan
Motor Co. , Japan’s second-largest automaker, was raised to
“outperform” from “neutral” at Macquarie Group Ltd. It was
also maintained at “buy” by Citigroup Inc. analyst  Noriyuki Matsushima , who said the stock is cheap in terms of valuations
in a report dated yesterday.  
 Nissan jumped 3.3 percent to 668 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
the world’s No. 1 carmaker, gained 1.1 percent to 3,290 yen.
Mazda Motor Corp. advanced 1.3 percent to 228 yen.  
 “Stocks are going through a technical rebound as they were
oversold,” said  Yoshifumi Kikuchi , head of the dealing division
at Tokyo-based Nissan Century Securities Co. “Automakers are
still cheap, considering their earnings potential.”  
 Upgrades on Brokerages  
 Securities firms had the second- biggest gain  among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups, as Credit Suisse raised ratings on
Nomura, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Mizuho Securities Co.,
to “outperform” from “neutral,” because of low valuations.
Nomura gained 1.9 percent to 541 yen. Daiwa climbed 1.8 percent
to 402 yen. Mizuho jumped 4.1 percent to 229 yen, the most in
the Nikkei.  
 All Nippon Airways Co. increased 2.8 percent to 290 yen.
Asia’s second-largest carrier by sales had its stock rating
raised to “overweight” from “equal-weight” by  Takuya  Osaka,
a Tokyo-based analyst at Morgan Stanley. He cited recovering
passenger demand for the rating change.  
 Nintendo Co. jumped 3.1 percent to 25,290 yen. The
company’s president, Satoru Iwata, will unveil a 3-D portable
game player today at the E3 game conference in Los Angeles.  
 The Bank of Japan said it will offer as much as 3 trillion
yen ($33 billion) in a new credit program that will extend loans
to companies for as long as four years in an effort to
strengthen the economic recovery.  
 Greek Issue Remains  
 Konica Minolta dropped 0.8 percent to 959 yen.  Fanuc Ltd. ,
an industrial-robot maker that gets 17 percent of its revenue in
Europe, lost 0.8 percent to 10,540 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
largest maker of cameras and which counts Europe as its biggest
market, sank 1.1 percent to 3,735 yen.  
 In New York, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.2
percent to 1,089.63 yesterday as Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Greece’s government debt. The service cut the grade
four levels to Ba1 from A3, citing risks from austerity measures.  
 “A downgrade on Greece had been expected, but I have
concerns more unanticipated negative news will emerge,” said
 Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee $2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. “There’s a wait-and-see mood in the market.”  
 Mitsui & Co. , Japan’s second-largest trading company, sank
1.8 percent to 1,092 yen, after BP tumbled 9.3 percent to a 13-
year low of 355.45 pence in London yesterday. The trader’s
subsidiary Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. has an interest in the oil
field where a BP blowout occurred, creating the worst oil spill
in U.S. history.  
 Mitsubishi Corp., which gets 39 percent of sales from
commodities, fell 1.6 percent to 1,888 yen. Sumitomo Corp.,
Japan’s No. 3 trading company by market value, slid 0.4 percent
to 949 yen.  
 Copper futures expiring in September fell on the London
Metal Exchange for the first time in six days, losing as much as
1.3 percent.
