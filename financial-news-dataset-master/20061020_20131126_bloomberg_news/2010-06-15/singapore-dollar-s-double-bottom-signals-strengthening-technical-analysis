             Singapore’s dollar will advance 0.9
percent to its strongest level since May 19 after the currency
yesterday completed a “double bottom” against the greenback,
according to Okasan Securities Co.  
 The currency slid to lows of S$1.4208 on May 26 and
S$1.4212 on June 7, and yesterday broke above the highest level
between those bottoms of S$1.3965, a “bullish signal,”
according to  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan.
Soma predicts the Singapore dollar will climb to S$1.3864,
citing a Fibonacci chart that is based on a sequence of numbers.  
 “Sentiment for the Singapore dollar seems to have turned
better,” Tokyo-based Soma said. “The favorable sentiment may
last at least for this month, pushing the Singapore dollar
higher from here.”  
 The currency traded at S$1.3985 against the U.S. dollar as
of 8.21 a.m. in Singapore, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Soma forecasts the Singapore dollar will first reach
S$1.3930 before taking out S$1.3864, the strongest level since
May 19, in two weeks.  
 The currency slid from S$1.3649 on April 30 to S$1.4212 on
June 7, with S$1.3930 representing a 50 percent rebound of that
decline and S$1.3864 being a 61.8 percent reversal.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other Fibonacci points are 23.6 percent, 38.2 and 76.4 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
