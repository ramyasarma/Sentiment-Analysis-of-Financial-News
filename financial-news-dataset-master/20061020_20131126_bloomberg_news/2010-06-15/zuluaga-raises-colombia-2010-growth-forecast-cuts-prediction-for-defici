             Colombian Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga  predicted economic growth of 3 percent this year,
higher than his previous forecast of 2.5 percent, as a record
low interest rate spurs bank lending and consumer spending.  
 Zuluaga cut his estimate for this year’s  central  government
deficit to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, from 4.5
percent, as higher oil revenue and faster growth boosts tax
collection. Zuluaga cut the consolidated budget deficit forecast
to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent. That figure includes profits
and losses of state-owned companies such as oil firm Ecopetrol
SA, and the surpluses and deficits of local governments.  
 Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing yields lower, after
Zuluaga said the government would sell fewer securities in the
local market because of the shrinking budget deficit.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell 0.01 percentage point to 7.95 percent at 12:34 p.m.
New York time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The
bond’s price rose to 120.577 centavos per peso.  
 The government will cut the amount of local bonds it will
sell in 2010 to 25.5 trillion pesos ($13.3 billion) from a
previous target of 26 trillion pesos, Zuluaga said. Zuluaga will
stand down in August when the new government takes office.  
 Growth, Elections  
 The economy will expand 4 percent in 2011, and the central
government will have a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP and a
consolidated budget deficit of 3 percent, Zuluaga said. Colombia
will sell $2.6 billion in foreign bonds in 2011, Zuluaga added.  
 Colombians vote in a second round of elections June 20 when
former Defense Minister  Juan Manuel Santos  and two-time Bogota
Mayor  Antanas Mockus  faceoff.  
 Santos, who heads the  La U  party ticket, won 47 percent of
the vote in the first-round ballot May 30 versus 21 percent for
 Green Party  candidate Mockus.  
 South America’s fourth-biggest economy emerged from its
first recession in a decade in the fourth quarter.  
 The recovery from the global economic downturn has been
slower in Colombia than in other South American nations, partly
due to a diplomatic dispute with Venezuela that caused a slump
in exports to the country that had been Colombia’s second-
largest trading partner after the U.S.  
 Venezuela, Growth ‘Lag’  
 Colombia’s economy will grow 2.25 percent in 2010, the
slowest in South America after Venezuela, which is still in
recession, according to an International Monetary Fund forecast.
The  IMF  expects Peru and Brazil to grow more than 6 percent.  
 Colombia “should lag” behind the region in economic
growth due to the trade spat with Venezuela, according to a Bank
of America  report . Gross domestic product expansion will rebound
to 3.4 percent in 2010 then accelerate “marginally” to 3.8
percent in 2011, the report said.  
 Santos will seek to achieve annual growth of as much as 6
percent within two years of entering office if he wins the
election, his economic adviser  Juan Carlos Echeverry  said in an
interview June 10.  
 He plans to boost government housing subsidies and increase
infrastructure spending as well as pull millions of informal
workers into the system, boosting tax revenue and reducing
unemployment.  
 Colombia’s peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,919.55 per
dollar at 12:45 p.m. New York time, from 1,924.00 yesterday.
