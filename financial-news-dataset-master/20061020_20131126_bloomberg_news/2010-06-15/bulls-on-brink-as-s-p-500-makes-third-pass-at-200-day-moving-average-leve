             The rally in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  above its  average level  in the last 200 days
captivated Wall Street for the third time in two weeks.  
 The benchmark gauge for American equities gained 2.4
percent to 1,115.23 as of 4:07 p.m. in New York, exceeding by
6.5 points the level considered significant by investors who
base trading decisions on chart patterns. The S&P 500 increased
to near the 200-day mean on June 3 and May 27 before losing as
much as 5 percent in the next two days.  
 Technical levels are affecting markets in the absence of
earnings news and take on more influence as traders fixate on
them, said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.3 billion at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati. The S&P 500’s failure
to hold above 1,105, its intraday high the day before May’s
employment report spurred a 3.4 percent plunge, was cited in the
index’s  drop  yesterday as it erased a 1.3 percent early rally.  
 “No one disregards technical  analysis  now,” said
Sorrentino. “If they do so, they do so at their own peril.
Technical analysis has become increasingly important because of
so much money chasing around. The momentum of money has become
more important than the fundamentals beneath it.”  
 Recovery From Plunge  
 The S&P 500 tumbled as much as 14 percent from a 19-month
high on April 23 through June 7 as concern grew that Europe’s
debt crisis will derail the economic recovery and BP Plc’s
leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the worst oil spill
in U.S. history.  
 Equities rallied today as an 11th straight month of growth
in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s manufacturing gauge
added to evidence the economic rebound is weathering the
European debt crisis. The S&P 500 has rebounded 6.2 percent
since June 7, erasing its loss for 2010, as concern over
European budget deficits eased and investors speculated growth
in China and the U.S. will bolster the global recovery.  
 “The bulls are slowly starting to wrestle back control,”
 Christopher Verrone  and  Nicholas Bohnsack , technical analysts at
Strategas Research Partners in New York, wrote in a note to
clients today.  
 More than 50 percent of  New York Stock Exchange -listed
shares have risen above their 200-day moving averages, Verrone
and Bohnsack said.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average , Nasdaq
Composite Index and  Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  are among
benchmark gauges that have topped their 200-day moving averages
in recent days.  
 ‘It Means Something’  
 The S&P 500 closed below the 200-day average on May 20 for
the first time since July 2009 and remained under the trend line
for 16 straight sessions before today.  
 “To the extent of people looking at this, it means
something,” said  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management, who oversees $770 million and whose flagship fund
beat 97 percent of peers over the last year. “It doesn’t tell
you that this correction is over, but I think people would look
at it as a plus and it would set up the test of the next
resistance, which most people would say is at the 50-day moving
average.”  
 The S&P 500’s 50-day moving average is 1,143, about 2.5
percent above today’s level, according to Bloomberg data.
