             Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz do Brasil
Ltda. is recalling some of its Sprinter  models  made in 2009
because of a problem with the parking brake.  
 “Excessive wear” may cause the parking-brake cable to
snap, preventing it from working and potentially causing an
accident, Mercedes-Benz said in  an announcement  on its website.  
 Sprinter models  made between July and September 2009 should
be returned to Mercedes-Benz dealerships starting today,
according to the announcement. The company said it will replace
the brake cables free of charge.
