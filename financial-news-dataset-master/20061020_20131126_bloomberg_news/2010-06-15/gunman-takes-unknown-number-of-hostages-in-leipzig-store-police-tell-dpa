             An armed man stormed an H&M store
and took hostages in the eastern German city of Leipzig today,
Deutsche Presse-Agentur cited local police as saying.   
 Police received calls from customers at the H&M store
shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time and began sealing off large
swathes of Leipzig’s inner city, DPA said.   
 Some people were able to leave the store and it’s not clear
how many hostages the assailant has, the newswire reported.   
 Several attempts to get through to the Leipzig police
department were unsuccessful.
