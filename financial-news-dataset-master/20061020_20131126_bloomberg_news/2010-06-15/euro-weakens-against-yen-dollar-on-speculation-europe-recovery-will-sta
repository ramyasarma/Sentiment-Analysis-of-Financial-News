             The euro fell for the first time in
four days against the yen after Moody’s Investors Service cut
Greece’s credit rating to junk, adding to speculation the euro-
zone’s debt problems will spread.  
 The 16-nation currency traded within 4 cents of a four-year
low against the dollar after a  report  showed German investor
confidence dropped by the most in 20 months. Australia’s dollar
fell after the nation’s central bank said the European situation
will weigh on the global-growth outlook.  
 “Moody’s downgrade brought the euro’s problems back into
the minds of the traders and effectively halted the rally,”
said  Antje Praefcke , a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “With the loss of upward momentum the euro is going
to drift lower.”  
 The euro traded at 1.2231 as of 10:40 a.m. in London from
$1.2221 yesterday in New York. It slid to $1.1877 on June 7. The
currency slid to 111.68 yen from 111.92 yesterday, when it
climbed to 112.87, the highest level since June 4. The yen
strengthened to 91.33 per dollar from 91.58.  
 The euro will drop to $1.20 within a week and end the year
at $1.17, Praefcke said. Australia’s dollar slid 0.3 percent to
85.61 U.S. cents, and lost 0.6 percent to 7820 yen.  
 Greek Rating  
 Moody’s lowered Greece’s credit rating four steps yesterday
to Ba1, or non-investment grade, from A3 citing “substantial”
risks to the nation’s economic growth from the austerity
measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134 billion) aid package
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  
 The downgrade prompted Citigroup Inc. to remove Greek
government debt from its World Government Bond Index, the bank
said today. Greek two-year government bond yields rose 82 basis
points 8.89 percent.  
 The Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European Economic
Research said today its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict developments six months
ahead, slumped to 28.7 from 45.8 in May. That’s the biggest
decline since October 2008 following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. Economists forecast a drop to 42,
according to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  
 “We remain bearish on the euro given that the euro-zone
debt crisis is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon,” said
 Gareth Berry , a currency strategist in Singapore at UBS AG, the
world’s second-biggest foreign-exchange trader. “The austerity
measures which are designed to deal with the crisis will likely
act as a drag on future growth. We continue to forecast the euro
at $1.15 in three months.”  
 Aussie Dollar  
 Australia’s dollar fell for the first time in six days
against the greenback after the central bank said “the
situation in Europe had deteriorated significantly over the
previous month,” fueling speculation it will keep interest
rates unchanged until at least the fourth quarter.  
 Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  left
borrowing costs at 4.50 percent at the most recent policy
meeting on June 1. Policy makers said today in minutes from the
gathering that previous rate increases gave them “flexibility”
to examine the impact of European events.  
 “The bank will be on hold for at least another month or
two and the Aussie has taken a bit of a step back,” said  Derek Mumford , a Sydney-based senior consultant at HiFX, a foreign
exchange risk management firm. “We haven’t seen the last of the
risk aversion in the market.”  
 There’s a more than 70 percent chance the RBA will maintain
rates at 4.5 percent through to the end of September, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on interbank futures on the
Sydney Futures Exchange.  
 The yen rose for a second day against the dollar as the
central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent at
the end of a two-day meeting. The Bank of Japan said it will
offer as much as 3 trillion yen ($33 billion) for a new program
aimed at expanding credit available to companies.
