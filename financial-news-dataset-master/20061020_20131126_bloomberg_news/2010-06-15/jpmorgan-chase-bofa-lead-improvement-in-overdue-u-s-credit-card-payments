             The top six U.S. credit-card
lenders, led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Bank of America Corp. and
 Capital One Financial Corp. , said overdue loans fell in May as
consumers avoided taking on new debt amid the economic recovery.  
 Loans at least 30 days late, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped to 4.22 percent in May compared with 4.4 percent
in the previous month and the lowest since last July, New York-
based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Write-offs of
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell except at
 Bank of America  and  Discover Financial Services .  
 The decline in overdue loans signals that the credit-card
industry continues to recover from a record $89 billion of
write-offs last year, when the  U.S. unemployment  rate topped 10
percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the U.S. economy, may remain muted as people focus on
“deleveraging,” according to Capital One Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Fairbank .  
 “What they’re really doing is choosing not necessarily to
go load up on some credit cards, but more to pay down debt,”
Fairbank said at an investor conference earlier this month.
“This deleveraging phenomenon hasn’t provided strength to the
economy.”  
 American Express Co. , the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, said overdue loans fell to 2.9 percent last month
from 3.1 percent in April. Late payments dropped to 4.8 percent
from 5.07 percent at McLean, Virginia-based Capital One; 6.39
percent from 6.73 percent at Bank of America; 5.59 percent from
5.85 percent at New York-based Citigroup Inc., and 4.95 percent
from 5.2 percent at Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois.  
 Write-offs declined to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent at New
York-based AmEx, the lowest for the group. They rose to 13.33
percent from 12.71 percent at Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which posted the highest level of
losses. Discover increased to 8.82 percent from 8.42 percent.
