             Corn fell for the first time in a
week and wheat halted a three-session rally after a  government
report  showed improving conditions for crops in the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter of both grains.  
 About 77 percent of the corn crop was in good or excellent
condition as of June 13, up from 76 percent a week earlier and
70 percent a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said yesterday. About 66 percent of the winter-wheat crop got
the highest rating, unchanged from the previous week and up from
44 percent last year, the USDA said.  
 “The wheat harvest looks great, so we’re seeing some
harvest pressure,” said  Larry Young , the president of Covenant
Trading LLC in Chicago. For corn, “we’re really in that period
where the weather is usually the culprit, and we’ve had ideal
conditions. Even with that last string of rainy days, it hasn’t
been too much.”  
 Corn futures for July delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.73 a bushel at 10:23 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. During the previous five sessions, the contract rose 5.6
percent. Before today, corn was down 9.5 percent this year on
speculation that warm, wet weather would boost U.S. production.  
 Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $4.6625 a bushel in Chicago. The grain gained 4.9
percent last week, partly because wet weather delayed harvesting
in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the biggest producers of
winter varieties.
