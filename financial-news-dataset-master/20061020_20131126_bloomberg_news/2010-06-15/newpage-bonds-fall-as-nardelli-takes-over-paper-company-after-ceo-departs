             NewPage Corp. bonds fell the most in
almost six weeks as  Robert Nardelli  assumed leadership of the
company after Chief Executive Officer  E. Thomas Curley  and
Chairman  Mark Suwyn  resigned from the maker of coated paper.  
 Michael Edicola , vice president of human resources, also
left NewPage, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP.  
 Nardelli, CEO of Cerberus Operating & Advisory Co. and a
former chairman of Chrysler LLC and Home Depot Inc., was named a
director and non-executive chairman of NewPage, the Miamisburg,
Ohio-based company said today in a statement.  
 “We thank Mark, Tom and Mike for their accomplishments at
NewPage, and wish them well in their future endeavors,”
Nardelli said in the statement. The board has formed a search
committee to recommend a new CEO, according to the statement.  
 NewPage’s 11.375 percent notes due in 2014 declined 2.1
cents to 91.3 cents on the dollar to yield 14 percent as of
11:50 a.m., according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. It was biggest
drop for the senior secured debt since May 6.
