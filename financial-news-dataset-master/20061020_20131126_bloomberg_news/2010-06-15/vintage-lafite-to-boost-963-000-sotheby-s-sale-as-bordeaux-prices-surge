             Chateau Lafite-Rothschild wines will
lead an auction that may raise 650,000 pounds ($963,000) today
as  prices  surge for top Bordeaux.  
 Buyers awaiting the release of the 2009 vintage have the
choice of wines from the last 30 years at  Sotheby’s  in London.
The Lafite may fetch as much as 34,000 pounds a case.  
 Top wines are recovering from a slump in the final quarter
of 2008 when the banking crisis cut investors’ wealth and
reduced demand. The Liv-ex 100  Fine Wine Index  rose 4.4 percent
in May, boosting it 23.8 percent since the start of 2010 and
taking it to a record high. At the same time, Bordeaux producers
are seeking increased prices for their 2009 vintage.  
 “Over the past five years wine prices have tripled,” said
 James Miles , a co-founder of the London-based Liv-ex wine
exchange. “I don’t think it would do any harm to consolidate at
these levels.”  
 The U.S.-based auction house is offering Lafite from the
1982 and 2000 vintages as well as wines dating from 1986, 1989,
1996, 1998 and 2002. The top price is for 1982s and drops to as
low as 4,000 pounds for 1989s.  Lafite  is the largest of
Bordeaux’s first-growth wine estates.  
 Sotheby’s estimates a 12-bottle case of 1982 Lafite offered
duty-paid will fetch between 22,000 pounds and 34,000 pounds,
while six magnums will sell for a similar amount. This Bordeaux
vintage is rated among the top 15 of the last century by wine
critic  Michael Broadbent , a senior consultant to Christie’s
International, along with years such as 1949 and 1961. Prices
reflect growing rarity as stocks are drunk down.  
 Case Estimates  
 Estimates by  Sotheby’s  for 12-bottle cases from other
Lafite vintages include 13,000 pounds to 17,000 pounds for two
lots of 2000s and as much as 14,000 pounds for a similar case of
the same year with slightly damp-soiled labels.  
 Lafite accounts for more than half of the anticipated top
20 lots in the auction. Other wines on sale include a 12-bottle
case of La Tache 1978 Domaine de la Romanee Conti Burgundy
estimated at as much as 40,000 pounds and a similar 11-bottle
lot of La Tache estimated to fetch as much as 38,000 pounds.  
 Other lots include an imperial, or six liters, of 1988 La
Tache; 12 bottles of Chateau Petrus from 1994 and three from
2000; 11 bottles of Chateau Mouton Rothschild 2000; five bottles
of Chateau Lafleur 1982 and a case each of Chateau Latour 1996
and Chateau Ausone 1998.  
 Christie’s Sale  
 At a  Christie’s  London auction on June 10, several cases of
Lafite comparable to vintages on offer today sold for higher
prices than the latest estimates, even taking account of the 15
percent buyer’s premium. The 2000 Lafite fetched 16,100 pounds
including buyer’s premium, the 1996 11,270 pounds, the 1998
7,360 pounds, the 1989 6,555 pounds and the 2002 5,980 pounds.  
 While the auctions have focused on wines going back over
the past 50 years, collectors’ attention has been turning to the
release prices of the Bordeaux 2009 vintage.  
 Top chateaux are likely to announce prices by early July,
and indications from rivals who have started selling are that
the 2009s are priced at almost 20 percent above the record-
breaking release levels for the 2005s, according to Liv-ex.  
 “The 2009s are coming out at very high prices,” Miles
said. “That will take away fire power from buying the back
vintages. Bordeaux has priced the wine to the absolute limit of
what the market can bear.”
