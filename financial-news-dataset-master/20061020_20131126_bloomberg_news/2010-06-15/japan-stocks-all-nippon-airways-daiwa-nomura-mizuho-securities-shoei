             Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
rose 8.04, or 0.1 percent, to 9,887.89 as of the close in Tokyo.
The following were among the most active shares in the Japanese
 market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  
 All Nippon Airways Co.  (9202 JT) increased 2.8 percent to
290 yen. Asia’s second-largest carrier by sales had its stock
rating raised to “overweight” from “equal-weight” by Takuya
Osaka, a Tokyo-based analyst at Morgan Stanley.  
 Frontier Real Estate Investment Corp. (8964 JT) leapt 3
percent to 650,000 yen. The real estate investment trust said it
plans to raise as much as 20 billion yen ($219 million) in a
public share sale to purchase properties and repay debt.  
 Hodogaya Chemical Co. (4112 JT) gained 3.2 percent to 323
yen. The chemicals maker said it will acquire a 34 percent stake
in South Korea’s SFC Co.  
 Iida Home Max  (8880 JT) surged 9.1 percent to 802 yen. The
homebuilder said full-year net income jumped to 5.95 billion yen
($65 million) from 795 million yen a year earlier, buoyed by a
gain in condominium sales.  
 Japan Wind Development Co.  (2766 JT) plunged by its daily
limit of 40,000 yen, or 22 percent, to 143,600 yen, the biggest
drop since at least March 2003, after the wind-power developer
said it will be placed on a so-called monitoring post by the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company is likely to fail to meet a
TSE deadline to file its earnings auditing report because it
changed its auditor, it said in a filing.

manager that has an investment partnership with Japan Wind for a
green fund, tumbled 8.3 percent to 10,100 yen.

percent stake in a venture with Miraial to a partner, the
companies said in separate statements.

yen.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc.  (8601 JT) rose 1.8 percent to
402 yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc.  (8604 JT) advanced 1.9 percent to

“neutral” by  Azuma Ohno , a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit
Suisse Group.  
 Nissan Motor Co.  (7201 JT) climbed 3.3 percent to 668 yen.
Japan’s third-largest automaker was raised to “outperform”
from “neutral” by  Clive Wiggins , a Tokyo-based analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd. The stock price estimate for 12 months was
also increased to 750 yen from 730 yen by Macquarie.  
 Shoei Foods Corp.  (8079 JT) increased 3.3 percent to 503
yen. The food-trading company said first-half net income more
than tripled to 1.18 billion yen, buoyed by improved production
in Japan and China.
