             Creditors of Capmark Financial Group
Inc. asked a court for permission to investigate a $1.5 billion
loan the commercial property lender took out five months before
filing bankruptcy.  
 The committee representing Capmark’s unsecured creditors
said in court papers that it wants to know whether Capmark
insiders wrongly helped lenders trade low-ranking debt for
guaranteed loans arranged by units of  Citigroup Inc.  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.   
 The new loan, “which merely delayed the inevitable
bankruptcy filing, did nothing to enhance Capmark’s financial
condition,” creditors said in court papers filed yesterday.  
 The creditors want U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Christopher S. Sontchi  in Wilmington, Delaware, to order Capmark to provide the
creditors committee with documents and to make company officials
available for questioning.  
 Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, filed for
bankruptcy on Oct. 25, blaming falling property values and a
drop in lending. As of June 30, Capmark had assets of
$20.1 billion and debt of $21 billion. The company lost
$1.6 billion in April, May and June, according to court records.  
 Since filing for bankruptcy, the company has sold most of
the assets in three sales, generating more than $1 billion cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Leucadia National Corp. bought
Capmark’s loan servicing unit for $468 million.  
 The case is In re Capmark Financial Group Inc., 09-13684,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
