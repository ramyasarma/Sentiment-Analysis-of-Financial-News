             The German public has less
confidence than people in Britain in government ability to
overcome the crisis in public finances, though Germany’s
difficulties aren’t as great as the U.K.’s, according to the
latest Financial Times/Harris public opinion poll.  
 Forty-five percent of German respondents said they trust
the government of Chancellor  Angela Merkel  “not at all” to
deal with the matter, compared with 34 percent of U.K. people
questioned who gave the same answer in relation to the British
government and Britain’s predicament, the FT reported.
