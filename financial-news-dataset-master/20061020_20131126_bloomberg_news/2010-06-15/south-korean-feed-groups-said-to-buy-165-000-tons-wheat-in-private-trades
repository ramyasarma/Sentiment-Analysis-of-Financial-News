             Two South Korean feedmaker groups
purchased a total of 165,000 metric tons of wheat in private
negotiations, said three industry executives involved in the
transactions.  
 The Korea Feed Association purchased 55,000 tons for
December delivery and Major Feedmill Group bought two 55,000-
ton cargoes for November arrival, the executives said today,
asking not to be identified because details of the purchases are
confidential. The transaction took place late last week.
