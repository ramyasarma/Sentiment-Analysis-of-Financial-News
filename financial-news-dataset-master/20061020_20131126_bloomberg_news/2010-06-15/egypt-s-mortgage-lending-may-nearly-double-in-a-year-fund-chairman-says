             Egypt’s mortgage lending may
increase to 8 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.4 billion) by the end
of June next year, Mostafa El Hayawan, chairman of the state-run
Mortgage Finance Fund, said.  
 Mortgage finance in the Arab world’s most populous country
has increased from about 200 million pounds in 2005 to 4.43
billion pounds this year, Investment Minister  Mahmoud Mohieldin 
said at a housing conference in Cairo today.  
 “By June 30 next year, this figure will be 8 billion,” El
Hayawan said in an interview at the event.  
 Some analysts and real-estate developers such as  Six of
October Development & Investment  estimate that the demand for
housing units in Egypt to be around 500,000 a year. Egypt has a
population of about 80 million.  
 The number of mortgage finance companies has increased from
two in 2005 to 11 this year, with an average interest rate of
12.45 percent, Mohieldin told the conference in a speech. The
average length of loans is 16.1 years, he added.  
 The  World Bank  has approved a $300 million loan to support
mortgage lending in the Arab country. Egypt will use the funds
to increase subsidies that the Mortgage Finance Fund offers for
the country’s poor.  
 The state-run fund will offer subsidies for 10,000 units
this year, and the cumulative number of such units may reach
65,000 in 2012, Mohieldin said. Households with a maximum income
of 2,500 pounds a month qualify for subsidies, he said.
