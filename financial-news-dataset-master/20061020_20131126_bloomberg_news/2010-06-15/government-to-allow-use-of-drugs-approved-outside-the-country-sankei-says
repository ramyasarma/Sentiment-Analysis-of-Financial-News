             Japan plans to allow the use of
drugs and medical devices that have been approved for use
outside the country to expand treatment options, the Sankei
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 About 200 medical institutions nationwide will be chosen by
2020 to use therapies that have yet to receive Japanese
approval, according to the newspaper. Some drugs and medical
devices used overseas take a long time to get approved by
regulators in Japan, creating delays to provide the global
standard of treatment to patients, according to the report.
