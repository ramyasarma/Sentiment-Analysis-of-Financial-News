             A $15 million  Pablo Picasso 
sculpture was among sales yesterday as Switzerland’s Art Basel
opened to invited guests, including Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich  and Hollywood actor  Val Kilmer .  
 Several works by the late  Louise Bourgeois  were sold at the
world’s largest fair of modern and contemporary art as
collectors snapped up museum-quality works by established names.
Greece-based Dakis Joannou, U.S. collectors  Howard Rachofsky ,
 Peter Brant  and  Irving Blum , and London jeweler  Laurence Graff 
were also in the VIP crowd.  
 “The top things are continuing to sell well,” dealer
Nicholas Maclean, of the London and New York partnership  Eykyn
Maclean , said in an interview. “If the auctions are successful,
it adds to confidence. The middle-quality modern works haven’t
returned to the levels of 2007, though.”  
 The 303 galleries at the 41st fair are hoping for demand to
increase as the market for contemporary works recovers from the
biggest slump since 1991. The decline of the euro against the
dollar is encouraging non-European buyers, said dealers.  
 The Picasso dancing figure, “Personnage” (1960), was
shown by the Geneva- and New York-based dealers  Krugier . The 3-
foot (90 cm) white-plaster piece was bought by an American
collector, said New York-based fine art representative Sara Kay.  
 The day before the fair, an  Amedeo Modigliani  sculpture
fetched 43.2 million euros ($53 million) -- a record price for
an auction in France -- at Christie’s International, Paris.  
 “It’s different from last year,” said  Sandy Heller , who
advises  Steve Cohen  of SAC Capital Advisors LP. “It feels
pretty frenzied. I haven’t heard ‘Sorry, it’s already sold’ for
a while.”  
 Bourgeois’s Baudelaire  
 Pieces by Bourgeois, who died last month aged 98, were
among the early sales. Her 2009 mixed-media work on paper, “A
Baudelaire (#7),” priced at more than $650,000, found a buyer
at the booth of the Brussels-based dealer  Xavier Hufkens .  
 Hauser & Wirth , with galleries in Zurich, London and New
York, sold a 1998 Bourgeois fabric-and-steel sculpture, priced
at $850,000. New York-based dealers  Cheim & Read  found U.S.
museum buyers for a 1996 sculpture of fabric-covered forms
hanging from a frame and a series of 28 gouache drawings from
2010, titled “Les Fleurs.” Both were priced at $1.5 million.  
 “As soon as Louise died, we saw a surge of interest in her
work,” Adam Sheffer, a director at Cheim & Read, said in an
interview. “It’s a mortality issue. People seem to have
realized that she was the heir to Giacometti.”  
 ‘Snow White’  
 Hauser & Wirth also sold two sets of five 6-foot-high
silicone sculptures of dwarfs by the Los Angeles-based artist
 Paul McCarthy . New works inspired by  Walt Disney’s  “Snow
White,” these were priced at $3 million per set. Cheim & Read
sold a canvas by the French-based painter  Joan Mitchell  for
about $2 million, said Sheffer.  
 “We’re back to 2007 price levels for some names,” the New
York-based dealer  Per Skarstedt  said. He listed a 2002
 Christopher Wool  abstract at $800,000, a 1992  Cindy Sherman 
photo at $500,000 and a 1987 Barbara Kruger silkscreen at
$700,000 among his sales. The Sherman went to a Swiss collector,
the Wool and the Sherman to U.S. buyers.  
 Hauser & Wirth was keen to avoid being overly exuberant
about its recent signing of Matthew Day Jackson. A new life-size
recycled wood sculpture of the artist as an astronaut sold to a
European collector for $150,000. U.S.-based Jackson’s work was
recently exhibited at  Francois Pinault’s  Punta della Dogana
museum in Venice. One of his works sold for a record 601,250
pounds ($890,000) in February.  
 “We’ve been careful about pricing this artist,” gallery
director  Iwan Wirth  said in an interview. “Otherwise, the
market is pretty much back to the world we knew in 2008. The
crisis in the art world lasted for six months, then it went back
up.”  
 Art Basel’s main sponsor is  UBS AG . The event takes place
at Messe Basel, Messeplatz, 4005 Basel through June 20.
