             Marfrig Alimentos SA  said it plans
to issue American depositary receipts to give access to
investors outside Brazil and increase the liquidity of its
shares.  
 The board approved the plan, which will be presented to
Brazil’s securities regulator in the next few days, Marfrig said
in a regulatory filing today. The company isn’t issuing new
shares.  
 Each ADR will represent one voting share of the company,
Marfrig said. The company has hired Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas as the depositary institution.
