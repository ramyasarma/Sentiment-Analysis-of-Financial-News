             Oil traded near a one-month high in
New York as gains in U.S. equities restored confidence that fuel
demand will increase.  
 Crude earlier extended yesterday’s 2.4 percent jump after
the  Dollar Index , a measure of the greenback against 6 major
currencies, dropped 1.7 percent in the past two days, increasing
the appeal of commodities as an inflation hedge. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average yesterday climbed 2.1 percent while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.4 percent.  
 “The indexes in the U.S. are getting better so everyone is
thinking that crude oil demand will increase,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a manager for commodity derivative sales at broker
Newedge in Tokyo. “Oil is trading in a range. Up or down
depends on the financial markets so one has to see the movements
of the euro and the stock markets.”  
 Crude for July delivery was at $77.03 a barrel, up 12 cents,
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:59 p.m. Singapore time.
The contract surged $1.82 yesterday to $76.94, the highest
closing price since May 6. Futures are up 9.2 percent from a
year ago.  
 “Clearly the price of oil is rallying due to a huge
upswing in the Dow Jones of over 200 points and a weakening of
the dollar index,” said  Mike Sander , an investment adviser at
Sander Capital Advisors in Seattle.  
 Crude broached a closely watched pricing point yesterday,
ending above the 200-day moving average of $76.94 a barrel for
the first time in a month.  
 “From a technical point of view we broke out of the
resistance of the 200-day moving average,” said Newedge’s
Hasegawa. “So it’s pushing us in a positive trend to test the
$80 level.”  
 Cushing Supplies  
 Oil’s gains yesterday were tempered after the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude
stockpiles rose 579,000 barrels to 358.7 million. A government
report today is expected to say  inventories  declined 1 million
barrels in the week ended June 11, according to the median of 15
analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The API report also showed a gain of 107,000 barrels at the
Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for the New York oil futures,
pushing supplies to 37.5 million, according to a note by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.  
 Brent crude for August settlement rose as much as 39 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $77.49 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract was at $77.32 at 3 p.m.
Singapore time. It climbed $1.44, or 1.9 percent, to $77.10 a
barrel yesterday.  
 July Expires  
 The July contract expired after rising $1, or 1.3 percent,
to end the session at $76.20 a barrel yesterday, the highest
settlement since May 14.  
 The euro strengthened as much as 0.1 percent today to
$1.2341 after gaining as much as 1.1 percent to $1.235 yesterday.  
 The currency touched $1.1877 on June 7, the lowest level
since March 2006, on concern that the debt crisis in Greece will
spread to other countries in the region.  
 The Energy Department will probably report that U.S.
gasoline  inventories  were little changed last week, the
Bloomberg News analyst survey shows. Stockpiles of distillate
fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, are
forecast to climb 1 million barrels. The department is scheduled
to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.
