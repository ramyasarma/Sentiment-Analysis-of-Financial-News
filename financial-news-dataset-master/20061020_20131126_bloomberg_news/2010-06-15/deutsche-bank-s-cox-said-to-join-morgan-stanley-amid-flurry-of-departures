             Deutsche Bank AG ’s co-head of
Americas real estate investment banking,  Paul Whyte , left for
 Credit Suisse AG , marking at least the 10th managing-director
departure from the firm in that region this year.  
 Whyte will become head of Americas real estate at Credit
Suisse, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News
and confirmed by  Duncan King , a spokesman for the Zurich-based
bank. Other departures from Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank this
year include  Peter Babej , former co-head of Americas financial
institutions, who left for  Citigroup Inc ., and  Mark Epley , who
headed the team that caters to private-equity firms and left for
 Nomura Holdings Inc .  
 The moves come amid a shift in leadership at Deutsche
Bank’s corporate and investment bank, the company’s biggest
money maker.  Anshu Jain , co-head of that business since 2004,
was appointed this month to be its sole leader, assuming
responsibilities for the corporate finance and transaction-
banking units on July 1 from  Michael Cohrs , who plans to retire.  
 Whyte replaces Eric Anderson, who will become vice chairman
of real estate investment banking in the Americas, according to
the memo. Whyte has worked for clients including Blackstone
Group LP and Starwood Capital Group LLC, the memo said.  
 Whyte joined Bankers Trust Corp., which was later acquired
by Deutsche Bank, in 1998 after earlier stints at Prudential
Realty Group and Salomon Brothers.  
 Deutsche Bank has also hired managing directors in the
Americas this year, including  Eric Steifman  from Morgan Stanley,
 Jonathan Tretler  and  Tim Kisling  from UBS, and  Curtis Launer 
from Sagent Advisors Inc.
