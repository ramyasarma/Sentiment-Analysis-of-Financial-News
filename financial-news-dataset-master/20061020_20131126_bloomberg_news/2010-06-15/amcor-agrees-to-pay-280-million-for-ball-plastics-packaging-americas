             Amcor Ltd. , Australia’s biggest
packaging company, agreed to buy the assets of Ball Plastics
Packaging Americas from  Ball Corp.  for $280 million to add five
plants in North America.  
 Amcor will buy the business, which has sales of about $600
million, with an unused credit facility at an interest rate of
about 5 percent, it said in a  statement  today. The purchase
price represents four times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization in the last 12 months, Amcor said.  
 Victoria-based Amcor, whose  biggest market  is North America,
is attempting to reverse two years of sliding annual profits.
The Ball acquisition pushes Amcor into new markets for wine
bottles and other food packaging, it said.  
 “There are opportunities to acquire businesses at prices
that are substantially lower than a few years ago,” Amcor Chief
Executive Officer  Ken MacKenzie  said in the statement. “The
capabilities of the Ball acquisition will help us expand our
business in North America and to leverage new technologies and
products in our growing Latin America business.”  
 Amcor  yesterday  added 1.7 percent to A$6.42 at the Sydney
close. The stock is up 3.1 percent this year.
