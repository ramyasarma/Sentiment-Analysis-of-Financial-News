             Mexico’s peso rose for the fifth
time in six days as manufacturing in part of the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, gained for an 11th month.  
 The peso increased 0.4 percent to 12.6426 per dollar at
8:56 a.m. New York time, from 12.6882 yesterday. The peso has
jumped 3.5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, the best
performance among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “We have some manufacturing data out of the U.S. and
hopefully that is good,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a
currency strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut. “Appetite for Latin American currencies is still
very contained.”  
 Manufacturing in the New York region expanded in June for
an 11th month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said today.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.25 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA.
