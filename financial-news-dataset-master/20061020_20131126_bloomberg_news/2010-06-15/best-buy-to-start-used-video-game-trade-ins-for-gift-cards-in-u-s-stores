             Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, plans to let customers trade in
their used video games at more than 1,000 U.S. stores to grab
sales from competitors.  
 Shoppers will be able to exchange the games for Best Buy
gift cards that can be spent on any merchandise, Chris
Homeister, senior vice president and general manager of Best
Buy’s home entertainment group, said yesterday by telephone. The
program will start late in the summer, he said, declining to
specify a month.  
 Best Buy reported today that first-quarter sales of gaming
merchandise fell in U.S. stores open at least 14 months. The
retailer wants to win sales of video games and gaming devices
from rivals such as GameStop Corp. and discount chains  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.  and Target Corp., Homeister, 41, said from Los
Angeles. He is attending the Entertainment Software
Association’s E3 Expo, an annual conference.  
 The company, based in Richfield, Minnesota, also plans to
set up touch-screen kiosks later this year that will allow
customers to test and preorder games, said Homeister.  
 The retailer accepts online trade-ins of electronics
including computers, mobile phones and gaming gear. It operated
1,069 U.S. stores as of Feb. 27.
