             The forces driving a sustained
growth in China’s economy remain weak, the country’s banking
regulator said today. Structural imbalances are acute, external
trade is threatened by rising protectionism and unemployment
pressures remain severe, the China Banking Regulatory Commission
said in its annual report posted on its website today.  
 “All these pose further constraint for a substantial and
meaningful rebound,” the report said.
