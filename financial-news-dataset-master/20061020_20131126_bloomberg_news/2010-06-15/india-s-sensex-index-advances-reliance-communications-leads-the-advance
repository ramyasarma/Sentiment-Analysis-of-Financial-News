             India’s benchmark stock index rose
to its highest level in more than a month amid speculation the
nation’s economy is robust enough to withstand any global
economic slowdown caused by Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 Fitch Ratings yesterday cited India’s “strong growth
prospects” and the view the debt ratio will be reduced when it
raised the local currency debt outlook to “stable.”  Reliance
Communications Ltd.  advanced close to a five-month high after
saying it’s in “advanced talks” to sell stakes in its tower
unit.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd.  climbed to the highest since
January.  
 “India’s growth trajectory is intact,” said  Kishor Ostwal ,
managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a listed
equities research provider in Mumbai. “The fiscal deficit will
go down and that’s very positive.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
added 74.66, or 0.4 percent, to 17,412.83, extending its longest
string of gains in almost two months to its highest level since
April 30. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
added 0.5 to 5,222.35. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.5 percent
to 2,205.50.  
 Reliance Communications, the nation’s second-largest
wireless carrier, climbed 4.3 percent to 186.8 rupees, its
highest since Jan. 20. The company controlled by billionaire
 Anil Ambani  is talking with local and overseas parties for a
cash and stock transaction for Reliance Infratel Ltd., according
to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian unit of the world’s
second-largest consumer-goods maker, advanced 1.8 percent to
260.15 rupees.  ACC Ltd. , the No. 1 cement maker, increased 2
percent to 879.9 rupees.  
 Wireless Airwaves  
 Fitch raised the outlook for local currency debt from
“negative,” citing the view that the government’s debt-to-
gross domestic product ratio will decline as it uses higher-
than-expected revenue from the auction of wireless airwaves to
reduce its budget deficit.  
 India’s economic growth will accelerate to more than 8.5
percent in the year through March, buoyed by higher factory
output, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said today. A measure
of  industrial production  expanded 17.6 percent in April, close
to a record set in December, a June 11 government report showed.  
 Hindustan Copper Ltd.  surged 9.1 percent to 512.6 rupees,
the highest since April 26. The government will sell a 10
percent stake in Hindustan Copper followed by a company offering
of a further 10 percent, Corporate Affairs Minister  Salman Khurshid  said today.  
 Overseas Investors  
 Overseas  investors  bought a net 8.96 billion rupees ($191
million) of Indian equities on June 11, increasing total
purchases of the stocks this year to 230.4 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years earlier in domestic
currency terms, as the biggest rally in 18 years lured foreign
funds. They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Balaji Telefilms Ltd.  (BLJT IN), a producer of television
shows, climbed 1.6 percent to 58.85 rupees. Reliance Big
Entertainment Ltd., a unit of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group,
may buy a 26 percent stake in the company from Star India,
VCCircle’s website said, citing people it didn’t identify.  
 Balaji Telefilms’ Chief Financial Officer  Sunil Shahani 
couldn’t immediately be reached at his office telephone for
comment on the report.  
 BOC India Ltd.  (BOCI IN), a maker of industrial gases,
soared 20 percent to 286.8 rupees, its highest in at least 18
years. Linde Holdings Netherlands BV proposed delisting the
company from Indian exchanges by buying shares held by public
holders, according to BOC India’s stock exchange filing.  
 Ennore Coke Ltd.  (ENNC IN), a power generator, advanced 6.8
percent to 95.4 rupees, its highest in two months, after 36.8
percent of its shares changed hands in two block transactions on
the Bombay Stock Exchange. Buyers and sellers weren’t
immediately known.  
 MMTC Ltd.  (MMTC IN), a state-run trading company, surged 21
percent to 34,533.45 rupees, the most since at least July 2002,
after saying it will consider a proposal on June 29 to issue
free shares and split its stock.

4.6 percent to 260.7 rupees.  Amit Agarwal , an analyst at Daiwa
