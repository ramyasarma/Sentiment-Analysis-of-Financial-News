             The cost of protecting Japanese and
Australian bonds from non-payment declined, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 4 basis points
to 137 basis points as of 10:16 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. Yesterday was a public holiday in Australia.  
 The Markit  iTraxx Japan index  fell 1 basis point to 143 as
of 9:10 a.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 138 basis points
as of 8:07 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
