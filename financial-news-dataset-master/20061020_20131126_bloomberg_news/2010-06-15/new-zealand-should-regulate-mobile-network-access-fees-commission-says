             New Zealand’s government should
regulate what the nation’s mobile phone operators charge each
other for connecting calls to their networks, the antitrust
 Commerce Commission  said today.  
 The government should reject undertakings made by  Telecom
Corp.of New Zealand  and Vodafone Group Plc, the commission said
in an e-mailed statement today. The recommendation affirms a
 draft decision  the regulator issued on May 12.  
 Calling plans like Vodafone’s Add-on, that offered cheaper
calls within the company’s network, would be “detrimental” to
competition in the market and deter smaller providers,
Telecommunications Commissioner  Ross Patterson  said in the
statement.  
 Vodafone has withdrawn the plan, the statement said.
