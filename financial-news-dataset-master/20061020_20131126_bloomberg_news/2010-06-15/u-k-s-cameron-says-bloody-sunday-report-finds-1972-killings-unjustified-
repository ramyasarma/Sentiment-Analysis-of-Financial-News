             U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
said a report into the 1972 shooting of 13 civilians by British
soldiers in Derry, Northern Ireland has found that the killings
were “unjustified and unjustifiable.”  
 “In no case was any warning given by any soldiers before
firing,” Cameron said in the U.K. Parliament in London today.  
 Cameron was speaking as an official report into the
incident known as “Bloody Sunday” was published in Northern
Ireland. He said he was “deeply sorry” for what happened.
