             The Hong Kong Monetary Authority 
said local stock and property prices may be driven higher once
China allows the yuan to resume gains, as the city become more
affordable to mainland investors.  
 “A substantial appreciation of the renminbi would support
asset prices in Hong Kong,” the central bank said in its June
Quarterly Bulletin, using another name for the Chinese currency.
Expectations of a gain “may suffice to pull capital into Hong
Kong,” the HKMA said in the  report  published on its website.  
 Further inflows of Chinese money into Hong Kong may
complicate government efforts to cool home prices, which have
risen 41 percent since the end of 2008. U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  said last week China should allow more
flexibility in the yuan, while loan, inflation and export data
have fueled speculation gains may be allowed.  
 The impact on consumer-price inflation due to higher import
costs will likely be “modest,” the report said, adding that
the impact on asset prices “could be more significant.”  
 The authority cited research suggesting a 10 percent gain
in the yuan against the Hong Kong dollar would add 0.4 to 0.6
percentage point to the city’s inflation rate. No data were
given regarding the possible impact on asset values.  
 “Hong Kong’s equity and property markets might benefit
from increased potential buyers on the mainland,” the HKMA said.
