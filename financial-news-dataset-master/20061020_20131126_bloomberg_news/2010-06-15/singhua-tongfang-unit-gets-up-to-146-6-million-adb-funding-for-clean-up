             The Asian Development Bank said it
is providing equity and loans of as much as $146.6 million to an
affiliate of Tsinghua Tongfang Co. to improve water supply and
wastewater treatment in the polluted Songhua River Basin in
northern China.  
 Tongfang (Harbin) Water Engineering will build,
rehabilitate and privatize water supply and treatment plants in
the basin which is home to 62 million people, the ADB said in an
e-mailed statement today. The project is part of a clean-up of
the basin headed by the central government, according to the
statement.
