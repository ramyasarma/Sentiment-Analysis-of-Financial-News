             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that the
dollar’s drop will enhance the appeal of U.S. exports, said
 Larry Young , the president of Covenant Trading LLC in Chicago.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on the greenback’s decline, Young said. Soybean-meal futures may
open steady to 70 cents higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil
is expected to open steady to 0.1 cent higher.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents higher a bushel on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange.
