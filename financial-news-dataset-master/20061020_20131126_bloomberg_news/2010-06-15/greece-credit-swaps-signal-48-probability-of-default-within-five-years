             Greek credit swaps signal a 48.5
percent probability the nation will default within five years
after its debt was cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The cost of insuring $10 million of Greece’s bonds for five
years jumped $55,500 to $811,000 a year, making the nation’s
debt the third most expensive to protect after Venezuela and
Argentina, according to CMA DataVision.  
 The downgrade of Greece as it struggles to lower a budget
deficit that’s four times the European Union limit fueled
concern banks of indebted nations will be shut out of capital
markets.  Francisco Gonzalez , chairman of Spain’s second-largest
lender Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, said yesterday
investors have “withdrawn their confidence” from the country.  
 “This is the biggest crisis capital markets have ever
faced,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of credit strategy at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in London. “There will be more downgrades.”  
 Greek bonds fell as investors shunned all but the safest
assets following the downgrade and Citigroup Inc. said the notes
will now be removed from some indexes. The ranking was lowered
four steps to Ba1 from A3 by Moody’s, which cited
“substantial” risks to economic growth from austerity measures
tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134.5 billion) aid package from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  
 “One cannot have both strong growth and strict fiscal
consolidation at the same time,”  Tim Brunne , a Munich-based
strategist at UniCredit SpA, wrote in a note to investors.
“There must be a compromise and this is particularly difficult
in the case of Greece.”  
 SovX Index  
 The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments increased 9 basis points to 150,
according to CMA. A basis point on a five-year contract
protecting $10 million of debt is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  
 Contracts on Spain climbed 18.5 basis points to 250.5,
Portugal jumped 16 to 318, Italy increased 9 to 200 and Ireland
was 15 higher at 254, CMA prices show.  
 “The credit cocktail is dominated by poisonous sovereign
and financial ingredients that look set to keep spreads under
pressure,”  Jeroen van den Broek , a credit strategist at ING
Groep NV in Amsterdam, wrote in a client note.  
 Spanish banks led an increase in the cost of protecting
against losses on financial company bonds, with contracts on
Caja Barcelona up 35 basis points to 327.5, Caja Madrid 28 basis
points higher at 455 and Banco Pastor SA rising 35.5 to 495.5,
CMA prices show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers climbed 2.5 basis points at 169.5,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Investor Sentiment  
 German investor confidence plunged in June on concern that
the sovereign debt crisis will undermine business prospects and
crimp growth in Europe’s largest economy.  
 The Mannheim-based  ZEW Center for European Economic
Research  said today its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict developments six months
ahead, slumped to 28.7 from 45.8 in May. Economists forecast a
drop to 42, according to the median of 35 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Five-year contracts on BP Plc jumped 54.5 basis points to
492 and swaps protecting against default for one year surged
81.5 to 632.5, CMA prices show, after Fitch Ratings downgraded
the company to BBB from AA.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed 2.25 basis points to 128.5,
JPMorgan prices show.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
