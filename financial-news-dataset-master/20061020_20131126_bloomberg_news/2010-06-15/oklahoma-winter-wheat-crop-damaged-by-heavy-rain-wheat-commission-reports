             Oklahoma’s winter-wheat crop, the
nation’s second-largest behind Kansas, has been damaged by heavy
rain, the Oklahoma Wheat Commission said in an e-mail.  
 Twelve inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in some areas
of the state, toppling wheat plants, the group said. About 38
percent of the Oklahoma crop was collected as of June 13, up
from 12 percent a week earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a report yesterday. Farmers who have yet to
harvest their grain may not get back into fields this week, the
commission said.  
 “It looks like we are four to five days off from getting
back into the fields in a lot of places and even then producers
are going to be fighting mud,” said  Mike Schulte , the executive
director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission. “Predictions on
wheat in the Panhandle are favorable if producers will be able
to get back into the fields.”  
 Wheat futures for December delivery on the Kansas City
Board of Trade, where hard-red winter wheat is traded, fell 1.5
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $5.075 a bushel. The price has dropped
5.4 percent this year, partly because global supplies are
expected to be the biggest in eight years.
