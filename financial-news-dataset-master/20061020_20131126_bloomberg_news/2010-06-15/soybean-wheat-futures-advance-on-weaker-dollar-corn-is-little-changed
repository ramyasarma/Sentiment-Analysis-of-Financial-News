             Soybeans rose to a one-week high and
wheat rebounded from earlier declines on speculation that a
weaker dollar will lift demand for supplies from the U.S., the
biggest exporter of both crops. Corn was little changed.  
 The  greenback fell  as much as 0.7 percent against a basket
of six major currencies, the fifth drop in six sessions. A
weaker dollar boosts purchasing power for overseas buyers who
use their own currencies. An advance today would be the third
consecutive gain for soybeans and the fourth straight for wheat.  
 “We’re keeping an eye on the dollar,” said  Larry Young ,
the president of Covenant Trading LLC in Chicago. “If we can
see weakness in the dollar, we’ll see more tenders pick up.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8.25 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $9.245 a bushel at 11:23 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $9.2625, the highest
level for the most-active contract since June 8. Before today,
the price declined 13 percent this year.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery advanced 2.5 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $4.70 a bushel in Chicago. The grain gained 4.9
percent last week, partly because wet weather delayed harvesting
in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the biggest producers of
winter varieties. The price earlier fell as much as 1.3 percent.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 0.25 cent to
$3.7525 a bushel on the CBOT. Before today, corn was down 9.5
percent this year, partly on forecasts for increased U.S.
production.
