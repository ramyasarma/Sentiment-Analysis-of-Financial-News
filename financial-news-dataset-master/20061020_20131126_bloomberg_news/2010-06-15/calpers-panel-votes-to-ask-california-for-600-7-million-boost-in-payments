             A committee of the California Public
Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension,
recommended the fund seek an additional $600.7 million for
government workers’ benefits from the state.  
 The Benefits and Program Administration Committee, in a
unanimous vote, sent the recommendation to the pension fund’s
13-member governing board for final approval tomorrow. It would
increase the amount the state  must pay  as its share of
retirement costs to  $3.9 billion  in the fiscal year that starts
July 1, from $3.3 billion this year.  
 State Treasurer  Bill Lockyer , a member of the Calpers
board, sought a one-month delay in the decision in May, saying
the increase would come as the state grapples with a $19.1
billion budget deficit.  
 Lockyer now supports the increase because the state’s
 Legislative Analyst Office  said only about $87 million of the
increase would come directly from the general fund in the coming
fiscal year, according to  Joe DeAnda , a spokesman for the
treasurer. Postponing the increase would mean the state would
need to make up the difference next year.  
 “The contribution increase is needed,” Alan Milligan, the
fund’s interim chief actuary, told the committee. “Not
increasing this year would be problematic.”
