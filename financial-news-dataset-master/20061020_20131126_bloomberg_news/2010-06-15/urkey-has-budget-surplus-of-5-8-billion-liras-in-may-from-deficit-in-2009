             Turkey posted its biggest  budget
surplus  for 21 months in May as economic expansion and lower
interest costs put the country on course to beat its fiscal
goals for the year.  
 The surplus in May was 5.8 billion liras ($3.7 billion),
the biggest since August 2008, the Finance Ministry said on its
website today. The country had a deficit of 610 million liras in
May 2009.  
 Turkey’s economy returned to  growth  on an annual basis in
the last three months of 2009 after four quarters of
contraction. It may have expanded 12 percent annually in the
first quarter, Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said on June 3.
The budget figures reflect better revenue collection as well as
a revival in economic output, Simsek said in Ankara today.  
 “The budget is good and essentially built on increases in
revenue,” he told reporters. “Spending is also under
control.”  
 Revenue in May rose 32 percent from a year earlier to 24.9
billion liras, helped by a 28 percent jump in tax income, the
ministry said . Spending fell 2.1 percent, with a 57 percent
plunge in interest payments outweighing a 17 percent increase in
other items.  
 Central Bank Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  cut the benchmark
interest rate by 10.25 percentage points in the 13 months from
November 2008. It now stands at 7 percent. Yilmaz has kept rates
unchanged for the last six months even as inflation accelerated
and the economy rebounded from last year’s recession.  
 Primary Surplus  
 The budget surplus before interest payments on debt, the
so-called primary surplus, rose to 8 billion liras in May from
4.4 billion liras a year earlier. In the first five months of
the year, the cumulative primary surplus grew to 14.2 billion
liras, more than double the year-end goal of 6.6 billion liras.  
 “The performance so far this year has created a strong
cushion and we have become more confident on our expectation
that the fiscal targets will be overachieved by some margin this
year,” said Yarkin Cebeci, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in Istanbul, in an e-mailed statement. That’s “likely to
continue supporting investor sentiment.”  
 Including interest payments, the deficit for the five
months was 10 billion liras, compared with a target of 50.2
billion liras, or about 5 percent of economic output, for the
whole year.
