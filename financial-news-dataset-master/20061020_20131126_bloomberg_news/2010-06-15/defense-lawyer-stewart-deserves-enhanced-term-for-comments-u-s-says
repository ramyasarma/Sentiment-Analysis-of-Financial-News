             Attorney Lynne Stewart, convicted of
helping an extremist cleric pass messages from prison to
terrorist followers, deserves an enhanced sentence because of
statements she made after her conviction and sentencing, U.S.
prosecutors said.  
 A federal appeals court in New York in November ruled that
Stewart, 70, should be resentenced in a way that reflects the
“seriousness” of her crime. U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in
Manhattan, who originally sentenced Stewart to 28 months in
prison and is presiding over the case, has scheduled her
resentencing for July 15.
