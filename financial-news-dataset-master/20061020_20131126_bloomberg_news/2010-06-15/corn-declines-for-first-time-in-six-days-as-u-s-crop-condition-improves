             Corn fell for the first time in six
days in Chicago on prospects for improved yields in the U.S.,
the biggest grower and exporter of the grain, after favorable
weather bolstered crop conditions.  
 December-delivery corn slid 0.3 percent to $3.74 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time,
rebounding from a decline of as much as 0.9 percent. The most-
active contract has dropped 10 percent this year, partly on
forecast for higher U.S. production.  
 About 77 percent of the U.S. corn crop was rated good or
excellent as of June 13, up from 76 percent a week earlier and
70 percent a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said yesterday in a  report  after the market close.  
 “U.S. corn-crop conditions remain fantastic and even
improved slightly last week,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a daily
note today.  
 The corn contract jumped 2.9 percent in the two sessions
before today, extending the longest advance in two months.  
 “Corn seems to have gone up too much,” said  Han Sung Min ,
a futures broker at Seoul-based Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co.
“The market will remain under the influence of weather and crop
conditions over the next several months.”  
 Japanese Imports  
 Feed-corn purchases by Japan, the world’s  biggest importer ,
may decline by about 2.1 percent this year from 12 million tons
last year, as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has spurred
a mass cull of pigs and cattle,  Nobuyuki Chino , president of
Unipac Grain Ltd., a Tokyo-based trader forecast yesterday.  
 Japan is culling 2.1 percent of its swine herd and 1.5
percent of the cattle herd to prevent the disease from spreading
beyond Miyazaki prefecture, the second-largest pig-farming
region and third-largest beef producer.  
 Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to $9.175 a
bushel.  
 The soybean crop was rated 73 percent good or excellent,
down from 75 percent a week ago, the USDA said. That compared
with 66 percent a year earlier.  
 Soybean crushing by the 16 U.S. companies in the  National
Oilseed Processors Association  totaled 127.8 million bushels in
May, down from 131.7 million a month earlier and 142.2 a year
earlier, the association said yesterday. That compared with the
average estimate of 130.1 million bushels by seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Wheat for delivery in September declined for the first time
in four days, sliding 0.2 percent to $4.6675 a bushel.  
 About 9 percent of the winter-wheat crop was harvested,
compared with 3 percent a week earlier and the five-year average
of 12 percent, the USDA said. An estimated 66 percent of the
wheat was rated in good or excellent condition, unchanged from a
week earlier.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris was unchanged at 138.25 euros ($169.63) a metric ton.
