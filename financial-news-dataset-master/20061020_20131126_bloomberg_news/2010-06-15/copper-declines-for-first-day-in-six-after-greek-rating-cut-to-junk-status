             Copper dropped for the first time in
six days, snapping its longest rally in more than five months,
on concern that Europe’s debt crisis may worsen after Greece’s
credit rating was cut to junk.  
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.9 percent to $6,601 a metric ton, and traded at $6,638
at 8:47 a.m. in Singapore. The metal yesterday capped its
longest gain since the six-day climb ended Jan. 4, on optimism
that China’s demand will rise. September-delivery copper in New
York dropped as much as 1 percent to $2.9830 a pound. China’s
financial markets are closed today and will reopen on June 17.  
 “Commodities have been bouncing back quite nicely in the
past few days and such events do serve as a reminder to people
that things are not back to normal,”  Yingxi Yu , an analyst at
Barclays Capital, said from Singapore. “Bad headlines coming
out every now and then will keep markets nervous.”  
 Moody’s Investors Service yesterday joined Standard &
Poor’s cutting Greece’s credit rating to non-investment grade,
or junk. In making the four-step downgrade to Ba1, Moody’s cited
“substantial” risks to economic growth from the austerity
measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134.5 billion) aid package
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  
 Copper, seen by some investors as a gauge of economic
activity as it is used in construction and transport industries,
has fallen 10 percent this year on concern that Europe’s fiscal
crisis, which began in Greece, will spread across the region and
hamper global growth.  
 Concerns about slowing Chinese demand after the government
took steps to prevent a property bubble drove the metal to an
eight-month low of $6,037.50 a ton on June 7. China has raised
minimum mortgage rates, restricted pre-sales by developers and
tightened controls on purchases of second and third properties
in a bid to curb property speculation.  
 Among other LME-traded metals, aluminum fell 0.5 percent to
$1,985 a ton and nickel dropped 1 percent to $20,100 a ton.
Zinc was unchanged at $1,797 a ton, lead climbed 0.8 percent to
$1,729 a ton, while tin hadn’t traded.
