             Cash premiums for corn shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to Chicago
futures on signs that the condition of the newly planted U.S.
crop is improving. Soybean premiums widened.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in June
was 37 cents to 39 cent a bushel above July futures yesterday,
compared with 38 cents to 40 cents on June 14, U.S. Department
of Agriculture  data  show. The premium for soybeans widened to 66
cents to 68 cents a bushel above July futures, compared with 63
cents to 68 cents, according to the USDA.  
 “We got an uptick there in crop conditions” from a USDA
report, said John Christopher, an analyst at Linn Group in
Chicago. “We’ve reached a point where we’re saying, ‘How much
better can the crop get?’”  
 Corn futures for December delivery were unchanged yesterday
at $3.75 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn is down
9.5 percent this year, partly on forecasts for increased U.S.
production.  
 About 77 percent of the U.S. crop was in good or excellent
condition as of June 13, up from 76 percent a week earlier and
70 percent a year ago, the USDA said in a  report  on June 14.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.75 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $9.155 a bushel yesterday on the CBOT, after
earlier gaining as much as 1.1 percent to $9.2625. The most-
active contract has declined 13 percent this year.
