             Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. , the
country’s biggest lender by branches, rose for the first day in
three after it said existing shareholders can apply to receive
two shares for every five held at 17 shillings apiece.  
 The stock gained as much as 0.5 shilling, or 2.4 percent,
to 21.25 shillings and traded 1.2 percent higher at 21 shillings
as of 9:37 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  
 The lender plans to raise as much as 15 billion shillings
($186 million) by selling about 887 million shares to more than
170,000 shareholders, Chairman  Peter Muthoka  told reporters in
Nairobi today. The sale opens on July 1 and results will be
announced on Aug. 5.  
 “We cannot meet our growth objectives into the future
without additional capital,” Muthoka said.  
 The East African government’s shareholding will be reduced
to 16.86 percent from 23.6 percent because it won’t take part in
the offer. The government didn’t take part in two previous
rights issues that raised 2.3 billion shillings in 2004 and 5.2
billion shillings in 2008, he said.
