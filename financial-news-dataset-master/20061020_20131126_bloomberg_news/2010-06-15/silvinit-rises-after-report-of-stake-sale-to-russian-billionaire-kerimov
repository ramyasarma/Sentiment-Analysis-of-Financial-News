             OAO Silvinit  headed for its highest
close in two weeks after Vedomosti reported that Russian
billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov  acquired a 20 percent stake from
shareholder  Dmitry Rybolovlev , citing people familiar with the
matter.  
 Russia’s largest potash producer gained 1.9 percent to
18,005.78 rubles at 11:11 a.m. in Moscow, heading for its
highest level since June 3. The stock earlier traded for as much
as 18,2777 rubles.  
 Kerimov, along with fellow Russian billionaires  Alexander Nesis  and Filaret Galchev, also bought 53.2 percent of OAO
Uralkali, the country’s second largest potash producer, for
about $5.3 billion from Rybolovlev.  
 “Nesis and Galchev are purely financial investors, as
there are no synergies between Uralkali and any of their
businesses,”  Georgy Ivanin , a senior analyst at Alfa Bank, said
in an e-mailed report today. “We therefore expect them to sell
a controlling stake in Uralkali to a strategic investor in the
medium term. The buyer could be a specially created state-owned
company that could consolidate Uralkali and Silvinit under one
umbrella to create a global leader on the potash market.”
