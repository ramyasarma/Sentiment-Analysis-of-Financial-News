             Brazil is on track with its
preparations for hosting the 2014 soccer World Cup amid concerns
that deadlines may not be met, according to the South American
nation’s Tourism Minister  Luiz Barretto .  
 “There’s always anxiety about the World Cup” and soccer’s
governing body, FIFA, “gets very anxious,” he said in an
interview in Johannesburg today. “They had the same attitude
towards Germany and the same here” in South Africa.  
 In May, FIFA Secretary General  Jerome Valcke  said delays to
Brazil’s construction program are “incredible” and that
preparations for the event are running “very late.” Brazil,
which was awarded the right to host the tournament in 2007, has
audited its progress and may reduce the number of cities hosting
games, Planning Minister  Paulo Bernardo  said on May 11.  
 “FIFA set deadlines for the 12 stadia and all the
deadlines are being kept to,” Barretto said. “So everything is
within the deadlines and everything is going as it should.”  
 Brazil, South America’s largest economy, expects the 2014
soccer tournament to attract about 500,000 visitors, Jeanine
Pires, the president of Embratur, Brazil’s tourism authority,
said in Johannesburg today. FIFA said it expects about 350,000
people to travel to South Africa for this year’s World Cup.  
 About 5 million tourists visit Brazil each year and this is
expected to grow to about 8 million by 2014, Pires said.  
 Infrastructure Spending  
 The Brazilian government is investing about 20 billion
reais ($11.1 billion) on infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup
and the Olympics two years later.  
 Of this, 11.2 billion reais is being spent on transport
infrastructure, 4.8 billion reais on stadiums, 2.5 billion reais
on airports, 1 billion on hospitality and 677 million reais on
the ports, according to Pires.  
 The government has budgeted the equivalent of $200 million
per stadium, Barretto said. Any additional funding will be met
through a combination of money contributed by the host cities or
from private investors, he said.  
 “Building has started already and $5 billion has been made
available. Each line of work has its own deadline and period,”
he said. “The beginning is always difficult.” Barretto
declined to comment on possible overruns in project costs.  
 South Africa’s budget for its World Cup stadiums grew to
11.5 billion rand ($1.5 billion) from 8.4 billion in 2006. That
excludes the 4 billion rand that host cities contributed towards
construction costs. Complicated designs and the high price of
inputs such as steel were blamed for the additional costs.
