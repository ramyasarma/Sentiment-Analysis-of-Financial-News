             Refinancing risk remains the main
threat to the credit quality of Europe’s junk-rated companies,
after bond sales slowed amid the region’s debt crisis, according
to Standard & Poor’s.  
 “Without a strong economic recovery, it is most likely
that companies will need to write down a portion of their debt
to achieve more sustainable capital structures,” S&P analysts
led by London-based Taron Wade wrote.  
 S&P’s European Leveraged Loan Index shows there is 37
billion euros of debt coming due in 2014 and 49 billion euros in
2015. Borrowers repaid about 12 billion euros of bank debt with
high-yield bonds in the past year, S&P said. Sales of $8.6
billion junk-rated bonds globally in May were the lowest since
March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 The rate of default for companies rated below BBB- is
forecast to be “well above the 4 percent average” in Europe in
this cycle, reaching 8.7 percent by the end of the year, S&P
said. The rate of non-payment fell to 12.8 percent at the end of
2009 from 14.2 percent at the end of September.
