             Colombia’s peso rose to a 10-week
high amid an increase in the price of oil and after the
government said it expects the local currency to trade this year
at a stronger level than previously forecast.  
 The government’s revised financing plan assumes an exchange
rate of 1,956 per U.S. dollar this year, compared to a previous
forecast of 2,365, Finance Minister  Oscar Zuluaga  said in a
presentation to investors and reporters today. It assumes an
exchange rate of 1,910 next year.  
 “That’s an important adjustment,” said  Camilo Perez , head
analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, Colombia’s second-biggest bank.
“Significant oil investment will continue to flow into Colombia
and the government will need to bring in dollars, which will
keep the peso strong.”  
 The peso gained 0.3 percent to 1,919.25 per U.S. dollar at
2:41 p.m. New York time, from 1,924.56 on June 11. That’s its
strongest level since April 6. Colombian markets were closed
yesterday for a national holiday. The peso has jumped 6.5
percent so far this year, the best performance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Oil, Colombia’s main export, climbed as much as 2.7 percent
today to $77.16 a barrel.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.98
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.131 centavo to 120.385 centavos per peso.  
 Budget Deficit  
 The bond’s yield earlier fell to as low as 7.93 percent
after Zuluaga said the government would sell fewer securities in
the local market as boosted oil and tax revenue reduces the
budget deficit.  
 “The market had an initial positive reaction, but since
those announcements were widely expected, the bond later erased
gains,” said Perez.  
 Colombia cut its 2010 consolidated budget deficit forecast
to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product from a previous 3.7
percent, and the central government deficit forecast to 4.4
percent from 4.5 percent, Zuluaga said.  
 The government also reduced the amount of peso bonds it
will sell in the local market this year to 25.5 trillion pesos
($13.3 billion) from an initial target of 26 trillion pesos, he
said. Colombia maintained its target for peso bond auctions at
13 trillion pesos.  
 Colombia raised its forecast for economic growth this year
to 3 percent from 2.5 percent, while expecting the economy to
expand 4 percent next year, according to Zuluaga.  
 “They have improved on expectations, especially in terms
of growth, which will lead to better funding,” said  Francisco Chaves , a fixed-income strategist at Bogota-based brokerage
Corredores Asociados SA. “A smaller deficit as a percentage of
gross domestic product means that they will have to sell fewer
bonds for funding.”
