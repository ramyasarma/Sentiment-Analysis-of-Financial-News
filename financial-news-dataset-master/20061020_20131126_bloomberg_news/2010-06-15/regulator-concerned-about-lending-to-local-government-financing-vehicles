              China’s banking regulator said
concerns about bank lending to local government financing
vehicles “weighs high” on its supervisory agenda.  
 Some banks have accumulated “large exposures and high
concentration” of loans to local government financing
platforms, although their loan review procedures and risk
control capabilities are weak, the China Banking Regulatory
Commission said in its annual report posted on its website
today.  
 Distressed loans to such vehicles must be accurately
classified and backed by adequate provisioning, the regulator
said. Bad loans can be removed from the banks’ books but they
reserve the right to recover the loans, according to the report.
