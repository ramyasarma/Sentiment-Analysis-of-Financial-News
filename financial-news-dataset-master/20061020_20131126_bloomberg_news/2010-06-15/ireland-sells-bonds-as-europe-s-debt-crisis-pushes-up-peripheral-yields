             Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros
($1.83 billion) of debt at an auction as the euro-area debt
crisis continues to push up the relative cost of borrowing for
the region’s so-called peripheral nations.  
 Ireland sold 750 million euros of 4.5 percent debt maturing
in 2018 to yield 5.09 percent. That compares with a yield of
4.55 percent in August, when it last sold that debt. It also
sold 750 million euros of 4.6 percent six-year bonds to yield an
average 4.521 percent. That’s higher than the 3.663 percent
yield at the previous auction of those bonds in April.  
 Ireland’s  National Treasury Management Agency  in Dublin
said investors bid for 3.1 times the 2016 securities offered and
2.9 times the 2018 debt. The agency has raised about 80 percent
of its 2010 funding target of about 20 billion euros.  
 Greek, Spanish and Irish bonds fell today relative to
benchmark German bunds after Greece’s credit rating was cut to
junk by Moody’s Investors Service. While European leaders last
month unveiled a 750 billion-euro rescue package for indebted
nations and governments pledged tougher austerity measures to
tackle budget deficits, the steps have yet to calm markets.  
 “Today was a particularly difficult day after the
downgrade of Greece,”  Oliver Whelan , head of funding at the
Irish debt agency, said in a phone interview. Still, Ireland is
in a “comfortable” position and is open to a “small amount”
of pre-funding for 2011 depending on market conditions, he said.  
 Yield Premium  
 The  premium  investors charge to hold Irish 10-year debt
over the German equivalent widened 17 basis points to 281 basis
points today. It reached 306 basis points on May 7. The Spanish
yield premium widened 1 basis point to 205 basis points, while
the Greek premium jumped 71 basis points to 641 basis points.  
 The NTMA said in a statement that it will continue “for
the time being” its monthly bond auctions. The next sale is
scheduled to take place on July 20.  
 “Given its comfortable funding position, the NTMA could
have easily skipped today’s auction if it wanted,” said  Alan McQuaid , chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin.
“However, at this point it is not about the sovereign, but more
about sending out the right signal to markets to leave the door
open for the domestic banks to raise required funding.”  
 Greece is also rated junk at Standard & Poor’s. Ireland has
an Aa1 rating at Moody’s and is AA at S&P, one level below the
top investment grade.
