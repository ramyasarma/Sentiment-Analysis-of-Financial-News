             Turkey’s  jobless rate  fell to 13.7
percent in the three months through April, according to figures
announced by the statistics office in Ankara.  
 The rate declined from 15.8 percent in the same period of
2009, the agency said in a statement on its  website  today. It
was forecast at 13.4 percent, according to the median estimate
of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The seasonally-
adjusted jobless rate, which compensates for higher employment
levels during the summer harvest and tourism months, was 12.7
percent, unchanged from a month earlier.  
 Turkey’s economy returned to  growth  on an annual basis in
the last three months of 2009 after four quarters of
contraction. It may have expanded 12 percent annually in the
first quarter, Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said on June 3.  
 Today’s figures were “encouraging,”  Ozgur Altug ,
economist in Istanbul for brokerage BGC Partners, wrote in an e-
mailed report. The rate is “still too high compared to the pre-
crisis unemployment levels and consequently, we do not expect
the central bank to modify its monetary policy stance because of
the improvement in the labour market.”  
 Central Bank Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  has held the  benchmark 
rate unchanged for six months, even as inflation accelerated and
the economy rebounded from last year’s recession. The rate
stands at 7 percent and the bank meets to discuss monetary
policy on June 17.  
 The economy added 636,000 jobs on farms and 957,000 in
factories and companies compared to a year earlier, the agency
said today. Unemployment among young people declined to 24.6
percent from 27.5 percent a year earlier.
