             The Australian dollar weakened,
snapping a five-day gain, after the central bank said it had
paused its rate-increase cycle amid uncertainty about the
effects of the European debt crisis.  
 The bank’s previous increases in borrowing costs “afforded
policy the flexibility to await information on how the recent
market uncertainty might affect the global economy’’ the Reserve
Bank of Australia said today in minutes from its June 1 meeting.  
 Australia’s dollar traded at 85.57 U.S. cents as of 11:35
a.m. in Sydney from 85.71 cents before the RBA statement.
