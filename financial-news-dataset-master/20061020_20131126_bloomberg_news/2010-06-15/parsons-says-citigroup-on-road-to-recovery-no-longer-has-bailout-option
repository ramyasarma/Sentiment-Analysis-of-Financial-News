             Citigroup Inc.  is on the “road to
recovery” and wouldn’t have access to another rescue from the
government should the need arise, Chairman  Richard Parsons  said.  
 “I don’t think there is the political will” for another
bailout, Parsons said today at a Bloomberg Link Boards & Risk
Conference in Washington. He said the New York-based company has
no need for more aid from the U.S.  
 Citigroup posted a $4.25 billion profit for the first
quarter after recording $27 billion of losses in 2008 and 2009
that prompted a $45 billion government rescue. The $700 billion
Troubled Asset Relief Program to stabilize the nation’s banking
system prompted calls for legislation that would prohibit such
government intervention in the future and impose restrictions on
the types of businesses large financial institutions could own.  
 Parsons said he doesn’t think the government should break
up large banks such as Citigroup because “the marketplace
requires institutions like ours” to serve global companies with
operations in more than 50 countries.  
 “Trying to bomb everybody back to the stone age, is the
way I call it, trying to make everybody go back to being a
community bank so that you’re not systemically important would
be counterproductive, would be from a U.S. perspective shooting
ourselves in the foot in terms of  global competition ,” Parsons
said.  
 Board Rotation  
 Parsons, 62, who took over as Citigroup’s chairman in
February 2009, said he “basically” agrees with former
Citigroup director  John Deutch ’s comments last year that all of
the directors who served before the bank’s bailout should rotate
off in an “orderly fashion.”  
 Parsons said he told new Citigroup directors that he would
stay at the bank “at least until we got the ship off the
sandbar and back out to deep water.” He declined to estimate
when that might happen.  
 “I think the ship is lifting off the sandbar,” he said.  
 In December Citigroup repaid $20 billion of the bailout
funds, and the government is now selling its remaining 21
percent stake in the lender.  
 The bank’s share price rose 11 cents to $3.99 as of 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
