             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, plans to offer more banking services and
products in Canada after introducing a new MasterCard rewards
card across the country.  
 “Over time, we would expect to launch additional products
in the financial services area,” Trudy Fahie, president and
chief executive officer of the Canadian banking unit, said in an
interview in Bloomberg’s Toronto office today. “For now, it’s
truly a singular focus on the cards.”  
 The  credit card  is the first offering from the retailer’s
newly licensed bank in Canada, which plans to target the 1
million customers who visit the 318 Wal-Mart stores in the
country each day.  
 Fahie wasn’t more specific about what banking products the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company may offer. The cards will be
sold at checkout counters as well as about 200 kiosks that have
been installed in Wal-Mart locations, she said.  
 The no-fee card carries an annual interest rate of 18.99
percent, she said. That compares with 19.97 percent for the
MasterCard offered by President’s Choice Financial, the bank
unit of Loblaw Cos., the country’s biggest supermarket chain.  
 The MasterCard offers holders loyalty rewards for every
dollar they spend, which can be redeemed for merchandise, Wal-
mart Canada Bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Wal-Mart joins other retailers including  Loblaw  and
Canadian Tire Corp. that offer banking services in Canada. Wal-
Mart already offers gift cards and money transfers in the
country.
