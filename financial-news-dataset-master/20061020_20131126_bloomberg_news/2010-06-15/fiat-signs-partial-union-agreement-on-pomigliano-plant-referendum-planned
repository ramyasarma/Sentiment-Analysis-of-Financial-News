             Fiat SpA signed an agreement with
four labor unions on its Pomigliano d’Arco plant near Naples,
said a company official.  
 A fifth union, the Fiom-Cgil, didn’t sign the accord, the
spokesman said. Fiat plans to make a decision on the feasibility
of the agreement after a worker referendum that will be held at
the factory next week.
