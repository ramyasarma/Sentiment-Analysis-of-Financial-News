             Oat prices surged, heading for the
biggest gain in a year. Futures for July delivery jumped 27
cents, or 11 percent, to $2.74 a bushel at 9:51 a.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. A close at that level would mark the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 4, 2009. The
commodity was up for the sixth straight session.
