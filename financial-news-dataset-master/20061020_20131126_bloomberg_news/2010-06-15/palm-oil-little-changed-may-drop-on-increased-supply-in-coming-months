             Palm oil futures declined on concern
that supplies may increase in the coming months while a set of
export data indicated a possible drop in demand from China, the
biggest user of edible oils.  
 Palm oil for August delivery dropped as much as 1.3 percent
to 2,378 ringgit ($729) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, more than erasing yesterday’s gain, which was the best
advance in three weeks. It closed at 2,391 ringgit.  
 “Rising soybean supply from South America” limited any
upside for palm oil, said an AmResearch report today. Soybean
oil is a direct substitute for palm oil.  
 The tropical commodity also declined after a set of export
estimates showed Malaysian shipments may have dropped in the
first 15 days of the month, led by China.  
 Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest
producer, dropped 2 percent to 608,324 tons in the first 15 days
of June, said market surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance.  
 Exports to China dropped 7.6 percent to 189,184 tons from
175,892 tons a month earlier, the data showed, while sales to
India and the subcontinent gained to 40,805 tons from 22,000
tons in May.  
 The SGS data contradicted earlier estimates by another
surveyor, Intertek. Shipments for June 1-15 climbed 1.5 percent
to 600,921 tons, led by a 28 percent advance in Chinese orders
to 206,450 tons, Intertek said. Dispatches to India and the
subcontinent dropped to 62,202 tons from 86,230 tons.  
 The two surveyors provide preliminary estimates five times
a month, with the official monthly data released by the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board on the 10th of the following month.  
 Technical Support  
 Concern over higher supplies from soybean and palm-oil
producers oil would push palm oil below 2,400 ringgit a ton, as
the European credit crisis hurts purchasing power, a Kenanga
Investment Bank Bhd. report predicted correctly yesterday.  
 The “technical support level to watch for now is 2,369
ringgit,” it added.  
 Palm-oil supply typically rises in the second half of the
year. This year, South American supplies of soybean oil are at a
record high.  
 Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade declined 0.1 percent
to $9.1524 a bushel at 5:58 p.m. Singapore time.  
 Chicago soybean oil dropped for the first time in six days,
easing 0.1 percent to 37.37 cents a pound, reducing the  premium
over palm oil  to $91.65 a ton, or 27 percent below the 12-month
average, according to Bloomberg data.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
which is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, dropped 0.2
percent to $730 a ton. The Dalian Commodity Exchange is closed
until Thursday.  
 Palm oil fell even as crude oil advanced, which typically
burnishes the appeal of vegetable oils used to make biofuels.
Crude oil in New York for July delivery reversed an earlier loss
to advance 1 percent to $75.88 a barrel.
