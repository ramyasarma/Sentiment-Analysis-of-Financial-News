             Dubai and Bahrain shares declined,
leading a drop in the Gulf, as Moody’s Investors Service said
banks in the United Arab Emirates face challenges in a weak
environment and lowered Greece’s credit rating to junk.  
 Dubai Islamic Bank , the United Arab Emirates’ largest
Islamic bank, retreated 1.5 percent and  Emaar Properties PJSC 
decreased to the lowest level since March. The  DFM General Index 
slid 1.3 percent, the most since June 6, to 1,502.69. Bahrain’s
 gauge  retreated 0.8 percent to 1,392.32, the lowest since at
least 2004, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index , which tracks 200 equities in the
region, dropped 0.4 percent.  
 Moody’s statement on U.A.E. banks “reminds us that the
real problem is financing; there is no incentive to put money in
the market and take on more risk,” said  Saud Masud , a Dubai-
based analyst at UBS AG. Investors will “fall into any
reconfirmation of a bearish outlook and will take international
cues.”  
 The U.A.E. banking system outlook remains negative because
of the nation’s “weak operating environment” and “challenges
facing Dubai,” Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today. The
 Dubai Financial Market Financial Banks Index  has lost 7.5
percent this year and Abu Dhabi’s  Bank and Finance Index  has
lost 8.6 percent.  
 Lowering Greece  
 Separately, the rating firm yesterday lowered Greece’s
rating four steps to Ba1 from A3, citing “substantial” risks
to economic growth from the austerity measures tied to a 110
billion-euro ($134.5 billion) aid package from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund.  
 Dubai’s state-owned companies may have to restructure more
borrowings as the debt-laden Gulf business hub struggles to pay
loans over the next 12 to 18 months,  Tristan Cooper , an analyst
at Moody’s said in an interview in Abu Dhabi yesterday.  
 Dubai Islamic Bank retreated the most since June 6 to 2.02
dirhams. Emaar, the builder of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
dropped 2.2 percent to 3.08 dirhams, the lowest level since
March 4.  
 The sell-off in the U.A.E. “is likely to continue well
into the summer,” UBS’s Masud said. “Oil is not approaching
$100 and there’s an overhang of debt. There’s no reason to begin
a summer rally.”  
 Kuwait’s benchmark retreated 0.4 percent to 6,528.6, the
lowest level since March 2009. Abu Dhabi’s  index  decreased 0.7
percent and Doha’s  QE Index  dropped 0.6 percent. Oman’s  MSM30
Index  gained less than 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index  fell 0.3 percent to 6,323.95.
