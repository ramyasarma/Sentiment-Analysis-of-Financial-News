             South Africa’s rand snapped its
longest rally in more than a month against the dollar after
Greece’s credit rating was cut to junk-bond status by Moody’s
Investors Service, damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 The currency weakened for the first day in four, declining
as much as 0.5 percent to 7.7102 per dollar before trading 0.4
percent weaker at 7.6973 by 2:07 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
close of 7.6701 yesterday. The move ended the rand’s longest
advance against the dollar since the four days ended May 13.  
 Emerging-market currencies declined from Budapest to
Johannesburg after Moody’s lowered Greece’s credit rating by
four levels to Ba1 from A3, as the debt-laden nation struggles
to rein in its fiscal deficit.  
 “Risky assets lost ground in the wake of Greece’s
downgrade,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at  Standard
Bank Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note today.
“This implies further rand weakness against the dollar. The
rand is vulnerable to reduced global risk appetite.”  
 Moody’s cited “substantial” risks to Greece’s economic
growth from austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro
($134.5 billion) aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund. Greece has cut spending and raised
taxes to reduce a budget deficit that swelled to 13.6 percent of
gross domestic product last year, more than four times the EU
limit.  
 Government bonds fell in South Africa, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 losing 4 cents to
1233.13 cents. The yield on the bond was steady at 7.99 percent.  
 Investors maintained bets that the South African Reserve
Bank’s monetary policy committee will reduce its 6.5 percent
 benchmark lending rate  when it next meets on July 22, forward-
rate agreements showed. The cost of  three-month contracts  for
cash in three months was steady at 6.40 percent. The rate
reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.  
 The rand weakened 0.3 percent to 9.4239 against the euro,
from a previous close of 9.3979.
