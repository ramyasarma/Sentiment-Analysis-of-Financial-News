             The rand strengthened for a fourth
day, heading for a 2 1/2-week high against the dollar, after a
U.S. manufacturing report added to evidence that the global
economic recovery is intact.  
 South Africa’s currency appreciated 1 percent to 7.5923 per
dollar as of 5:45 p.m. in Johannesburg. A close at that level
would be the highest since May 27. It ended trading at 7.6701
yesterday. Earlier today the rand declined as much as 0.5
percent to 7.7102.  
 Manufacturing in the New York region expanded in June at a
faster pace, a further sign that the world’s biggest economy is
recovering as Europe’s debt crisis leads to spending cuts on the
continent. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  general
economic index  rose to 19.6, an 11th month of growth.  
 “The U.S. manufacturing data was more or less in line with
expectations but anything that’s not bad news right now is
actually being interpreted as good news,” said  Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of currency research in Frankfurt at
Commerzbank AG, Germany’s second-biggest lender.  
 The rand weakened earlier today after Greece’s credit
rating was cut to junk-bond status by Moody’s Investors Service,
damping demand for higher-yielding assets. Moody’s lowered
Greece’s credit rating by four steps to Ba1 from A3, as the
debt-laden nation struggles to reduce a budget deficit that
swelled to 13.6 percent of gross domestic product last year,
more than four times the EU limit.  
 Government bonds were little changed in South Africa, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 losing
less than 1 cent to 123.17 rand. The yield on the bond was
steady at 7.98 percent.  
 Investors maintained bets that the South African Reserve
Bank’s monetary policy committee will reduce its 6.5 percent
 benchmark lending rate  when it next meets on July 22, forward-
rate agreements showed. The cost of  three-month contracts  for
cash in three months was steady at 6.40 percent. The rate
reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.  
 Against the euro, the rand appreciated 0.2 percent to
9.3775, from a previous close of 9.3979.
