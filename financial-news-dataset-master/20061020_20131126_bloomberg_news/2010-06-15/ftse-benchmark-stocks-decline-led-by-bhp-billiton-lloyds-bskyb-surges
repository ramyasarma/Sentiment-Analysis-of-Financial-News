             U.K. stocks  rose for a fifth day,
the longest stretch of gains in four months, as British Sky
Broadcasting Plc received a takeover offer from News Corp.,
overshadowing a decline in BP shares.  
 BSkyB, the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV provider, jumped 18
percent as  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. offered to buy the rest
of the company for 7.8 billion pounds ($11.5 billion). ICAP Plc
climbed 2.1 percent after Numis Corp. raised its recommendation
on the shares.  Inmarsat Plc  sank 4.6 percent after being
downgraded at Bank of America Corp. BP Plc headed for its lowest
close since October 2008.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  added 16.27, or 0.3 percent,
to 5,218.4 at 2:37 p.m. in London. The index has fallen 10
percent from this year’s high on April 15 on concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will hurt the economic recovery and as BP
Plc lost more than a third of its value following an oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico. The  FTSE All-Share Index  rose 0.4 percent
and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  increased 0.7 percent today.  
 The BSkyB offer is “adding to the good feeling today,”
said  Bill Ismail , a senior sales trader at City Index Ltd. in
London. “It’s a boost of confidence. Hopefully a bit more M&A
will follow.”  
 BSkyB Surges  
 BSkyB soared 18 percent to 712 pence, the biggest gain in
more than eight years, after the company rejected an offer of
700 pence a share from News Corp. for the 61 percent stake it
doesn’t already own. BSkyB’s independent directors said they may
be prepared to accept an offer of more than 800 pence a share.  
  ICAP  advanced 2.1 percent to 426 pence. The world’s largest
broker of transactions between banks was raised to “add” from
“reduce” at Numis.  
 Inmarsat, the world’s biggest provider of satellite
services to the maritime industry, retreated 4.6 percent to
783.5 pence. The stock was cut to “underperform” from
“neutral” at BofA Merrill Lynch.  
  BP  slipped 2.5 percent to 346.7 pence, for a 30 percent
drop so far this month. The company’s credit rating was cut to
two levels above non-investment grade, or junk, by Fitch Ratings
on concern over the potential cost of cleaning up the spill and
meeting future liabilities.  
 The following shares rose or fell in London. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 Bellway Plc  (BWY LN) slid 2.3 percent to 620.5 pence,
dropping for a third day. The U.K. homebuilder specializing in
first-time buyers said sales and visitor levels have declined
since last month’s election on uncertainty about government
spending plans.  
 Healthcare Locums Plc  (HLO LN) plunged 17 percent to 180.25
pence, the biggest drop since March. The company said that all
discussions about a possible takeover offer have ceased.  
 InterContinental Hotels Group Plc  (IHG LN), the world’s
largest lodging operator by number of rooms, climbed 2.7 percent
to 1,229 pence. The company held two investor days in New York
last week and “we were impressed by IHG’s demonstration of
expertise in terms of branding and servicing franchisees, which
we consider a clear advantage versus peers for future growth,”
analysts at Societe Generale Cross Asset Research wrote in a
note dated yesterday.  
 Photo-Me International Plc  (PHTM LN) soared 13 percent to
34 pence, the biggest gain since March. The U.K. operator of
photo booths said its pretax profit excluding one-time items
will exceed current market estimates of about 10.5 million
pounds for the year ended April 30 by about 20 percent.  
 Spice Plc  (SPI LN) jumped 7 percent to 53.25 pence, gaining
for a second day. Cinven Ltd. confirmed it is considering an
offer for Spice and said it made an approach on May 24. Spice
rejected the bid of 56 pence a share. Talks are not taking place
between the companies, Cinven said.
