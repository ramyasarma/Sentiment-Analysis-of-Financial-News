             Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. , a
maker of acne and wrinkle treatments, sued  Mylan Inc.  seeking to
stop sales of a generic form of its Solodyn tablets used to
treat pimples.  
 Mylan and a subsidiary are seeking U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval for a generic version of the treatment
before the patent held by Medicis expires, according to the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  
 “Medicis will be irreparably harmed” unless Mylan is
prohibited from infringing the patent before it expires in 2018,
the plaintiff contends in court papers.  
 Medicis, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, logged
$571.9 million in revenue last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported
sales of $5.09 billion last year.  
 Michael Laffin , a spokesman for Mylan, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  
 The case is Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Mylan Inc.,
10CV524, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
