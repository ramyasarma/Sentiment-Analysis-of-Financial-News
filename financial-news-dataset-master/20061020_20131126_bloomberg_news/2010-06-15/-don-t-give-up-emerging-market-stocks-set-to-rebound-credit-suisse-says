             Emerging-market stocks may rebound
as long as the peak in the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development’s leading indicator isn’t followed by another
global recession, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  
 Developing-nation stocks have historically advanced an
average 22 percent in the 12 months after highs in the indicator
followed by so-called soft landings, said Credit Suisse analysts
led by  Sakthi Siva , the top-ranked Asia strategist in
Institutional Investor’s 2010 poll. Russian, South Korean and
Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong are their top picks.  
 The OECD, founded in 1961 from the organization formed to
administer Marshall Plan aid after World War II, said on June 11
that “tentative signs of a potential peak have appeared.” Its
composite leading indicator increased 10.2 percent in March from
a year earlier before slowing to 9.7 percent in April, according
to Credit Suisse figures.  
 “Don’t give up,” the strategists wrote. “Global emerging
markets and Asia excluding Japan valuations are now more
attractive than at prior peaks in the OECD composite leading
indicator. We also highlight that consensus  earnings-per-share 
revisions continue to be positive.”  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  has dropped 11 percent from
this year’s high of 1,047.51 set on April 15 amid a spread in
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and as China imposes curbs on
property speculation that may cool the nation’s economy. The
gauge is valued at about 11.9 times estimated earnings, down
from 16.6 times at the start of the year.  
 ‘Soft Landing’  
 The risk of a “double dip” is low given that it has only
occurred once in the past 90 years, the brokerage said, citing
analysis by Credit Suisse’s chief global equity strategist
 Andrew Garthwaite . Other economic data including the European
Purchasing Managers Index and Germany’s Ifo business
expectations gauge “are also consistent with a soft landing,”
according to the report.  
 Russia  is the third-most undervalued stock market among
developing nations, based on a model that values companies’ net
assets and return on equity, the strategists said. South Korea
is ranked fifth lowest, while China’s H shares are seventh
lowest.  
 The brokerage also recently reduced its “overweight” in
Indonesia.
