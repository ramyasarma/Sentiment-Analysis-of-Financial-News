             Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG , the
world’s largest maker of printing presses, dropped the most in
eight months in Frankfurt trading after the company said it
plans to sell stock to cut debt.  
 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen  fell  as much as 1.05 euros, or
12 percent, to 7.66 euros, the biggest intraday drop  since  Oct.
12, and was down 9.5 percent as of 10:35 a.m. That pared the
 gain  this year to 44 percent, the  fourth-biggest increase  in
Germany’s 50-member MDAX index for medium-sized companies. Until
yesterday, the stock was the  index ’s best performer.  
 The company will seek approval at the annual shareholders
meeting on July 29 to sell as many as 156 million new no-par
value shares, twice amount of stock outstanding today, to raise
420 million euros, the Heidelberg, Germany-based manufacturer
said today in a statement. The company  expects  a “significant
net loss” in the 12 months through March 2011 following a
229 million-euro ($279 million) loss the previous year.  
 “The huge capital increase will be the basis for the
company to allow for the necessary refinancing, but the dilution
effect will be enormous,”  Peter Rothenaicher , an analyst at
UniCredit SpA in Munich with a “sell”  recommendation  on the
stock, said in a research report.  
 Proceeds from the stock sale will be used to reduce  debt  by
about half to “normal levels” of 400 million euros to 500
million euros, Chief Financial Officer  Dirk Kaliebe  said today
in an online presentation.  
 “Medium-term” goals include revenue exceeding 3 billion
euros, compared with 2.3 billion euros last year, and earnings
before interest and taxes of more than 5 percent of revenue.
Heidelberger Druck plans to eliminate another 850  jobs  by
December after cutting 4,000 positions in the past two years,
the company also said.
