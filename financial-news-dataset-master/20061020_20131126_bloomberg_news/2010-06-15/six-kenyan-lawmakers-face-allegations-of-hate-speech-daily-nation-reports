             A Kenyan minister, an assistant
minister and four lawmakers face allegations of hate speech, the
 Daily Nation  said, citing Mzalendo Kibunjia, chairman of the
country’s  National Cohesion and Integration Commission .  
 Higher Education Minister  William Ruto  is among those
accused of making inflammatory comments about a new constitution
that will be put to a referendum on Aug. 4, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported, without elaborating. The commission has
asked security agencies to look into a prosecution, Kibunjia
said.  
 If found guilty, the six could be fined as much as 1
million shillings ($12,384) and serve as many as five years in
prison, the Daily Nation reported. Ruto has denied the charges,
it said.  
 Ruto didn’t answer his mobile phone when Bloomberg News
called seeking comment today.
