             Poland’s  inflation rate  fell further
below the central bank’s target in May to the lowest since
August 2007, as a weak economic recovery damped consumer demand.  
 Annual inflation slowed to 2.2 percent from 2.4 percent in
April, the Warsaw-based  Central Statistical Office  said today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists was
for 2.3 percent, while the Finance Ministry estimated the rate
at 2.1 percent. Consumer prices grew 0.3 on the month.  
 Inflation slowed for a fourth month and was below the
central bank’s 2.5 percent target for a second month. Economic
growth in Poland, the only European Union country to avoid a
recession last year, eased to 3 percent in the first quarter
from 3.3 percent in the last three months of 2009.  
 “Today’s data don’t change prospects for inflation and
monetary policy in the coming months when the slowing will be
continued,” said  Maja Goettig , chief economist at Bank BPH in
Warsaw. “Because of declining inflation, the Monetary Policy
Council will not be inclined to increase interest rates.”  
 The  Narodowy Bank Polski  forecasts the inflation rate will
fall to as low as 1.4 percent by the third quarter before moving
back toward the target at the end of the year. The bank will
publish its new inflation projection at the end of the month.  
 The council has kept the seven-day reference rate at a
record-low 3.5 percent since June last year.  
 In May last year, inflation was 3.6 percent. Price
growth slowed in May mainly due to falling clothing and shoe
prices, which dropped 4.1 percent on the year and 0.2 percent on
the month, the office said. Food prices increased 0.6 percent
from a year ago and 0.7 percent from April.  
 The zloty traded at 4.067 per euro at 3:15 p.m. in Warsaw,
from 4.077 before the release.
