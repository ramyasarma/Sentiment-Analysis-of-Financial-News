             Olympic tennis champion  Elena Dementieva  pulled out of Wimbledon because of an injury,
according to a  statement  on her website.  
 “Elena Dementieva will not play Wimbledon this year,” the
statement said. “She hasn’t recovered from the calf injury that
forced her to retire at Roland Garros.”  
 The fifth-ranked Russian, who won a singles gold medal at
the Beijing Summer Games, was forced to quit during her
semifinal at the French Open against eventual champion  Francesca Schiavone  of Italy on June 3. Dementieva reached the semifinals
at Wimbledon last year.  
 Dementieva, 28, hasn’t missed a major since she played her
first Grand Slam event at the 1999 Australian Open. A runner-up
at Roland Garros and the U.S. Open, she has appeared in 46
consecutive majors.  
 The  Wimbledon championships  start June 21 in London.
