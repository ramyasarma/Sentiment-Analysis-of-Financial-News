             The National Union of Mineworkers
said it will lower its demands for an 18 percent pay increase
for workers at Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned South
African power utility.  
 “Negotiation is a process of give and take,” Oupa Komane,
the deputy general secretary of NUM, told reporters in
Johannesburg today. “There will be movement” on the union’s
wage demands, he said.
