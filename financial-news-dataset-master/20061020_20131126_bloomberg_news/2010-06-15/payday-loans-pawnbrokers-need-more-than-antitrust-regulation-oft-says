             A British competition regulator said
the 7.5 billion pound ($11 billion) market for high-cost payday
loans, pawnbroking and rent-to-buy products may have “deep
seated” problems that can’t be fixed through regulation.  
 While the industry works well by serving customers who
can’t get loans from “mainstream” lenders, problems such as a
lack of choice and the financial weakness of some customers
can’t be repaired by price controls or other rules, the  Office
of Fair Trading  said today in a statement in London.  
 “More radical approaches which are beyond the OFT’s remit
would be required if the government or others wanted to tackle
the wider social, economic and financial context in which high-
cost credit markets exist,” the OFT said in the statement.  
 The OFT has been investigating the financial industry since
the global credit crisis started. Last week the watchdog began a
study of the market for equity underwriting and rights offerings
that generated 2 billion pounds for securities firms last year.
That followed a study of barriers preventing competition in the
retail banking industry and a failed attempt to examine the
fairness of bank overdraft fees.  
 In March, the U.K.’s independent government auditor said
the OFT isn’t bringing enough market-enforcement actions to
build case law in the country and benefit consumers.
