              European stocks pared earlier
losses, as News Corp.’s offer for British Sky Broadcasting Group
plc offset renewed concern about the sovereign debt crisis as
Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s rating to junk.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.1 percent to
252.26 at 9:23 a.m. in London, after earlier falling as much as
0.7 percent, as BSkyB surged 19 percent to 715 pence. Futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent.
