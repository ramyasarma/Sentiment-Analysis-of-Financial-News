             Raw sugar fell on bets that the
longest rally since August was exaggerated.  
 “Producers made some statements in the last couple of days
that potentially prices are going to pull back a little bit,”
said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. The market was “getting a little
bit exhausted to the upside. Some of the technical indicators
are indicating it’s a little bit overdone,” he said.  
 Prices climbed in the previous five sessions, jumping 12
percent. Sugar has slumped 41 percent this year, partly on
speculation that global production will increase.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.04 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 15.95 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached 16.13 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since April 23.  
 “The market is taking a pause,” said  Jeff Bauml , a senior
vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in New
York. “The short-term fundamentals remain constructive.”  
 A surplus in the year starting Oct. 1 is “unlikely to be
sufficient to rebuild supply pipelines,” Czarnikow Group Ltd.
said this month. Two years of shortfalls reduced stockpiles by
27 million metric tons, the broker said.  
 In London, refined-sugar futures for August delivery gained
$l.50, or 0.3 percent, to $528 a metric ton on the Liffe
exchange.
