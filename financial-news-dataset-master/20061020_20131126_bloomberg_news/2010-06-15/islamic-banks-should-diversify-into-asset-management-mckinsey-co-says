             Islamic banks should diversify into
areas such as asset management after real estate industry
investments caused them greater losses during the credit crisis
than conventional banks, according to McKinsey & Co Inc.  
 One third of the assets of Islamic banks in Qatar are
“directly exposed in some way to real estate” compared with 15
percent for other banks, Amer Afiouni, Islamic finance associate
principal at the consulting firm, said in Singapore. “Whether
on the liquidity front or work-out front, Islamic banks need to
look at their profitability and risk management.”  
 Financial institutions worldwide either wrote-down or lost
a combined $1.77 trillion as the subprime mortgage meltdown in
the U.S. sparked a global recession. As economies recover,
Islamic banks, which comply with Muslim law banning the receipt
of interest and investments in gambling or alcohol, should look
to expand into areas such as asset and wealth management where
traditionally their presence has been weak, Dubai-based Afiouni
said at the 2010  World Islamic Banking Conference .  
 “Islamic banks aren’t present in many high growth areas,
and are almost absent from investment banking league tables,”
he said.
