             Nestle SA , the world’s biggest
foodmaker, said it began legal action against  Sara Lee Corp.  in
France for alleged patent violations on its Nespresso coffee-
making system.  
 Nestle “will always take appropriate steps to defend our
intellectual property rights when these have been infringed,”
the Vevey, Switzerland-based company said today in an e-mailed
response to questions, without giving details. Ferhat Soygenis,
a spokesman, declined to comment further on the proceedings.  
 Sara Lee started selling L’OR Espresso capsules that are
compatible with Nespresso single-serving coffee machines in
French stores in April. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based
company is “confident our product complies with all applicable
legal and regulatory requirements,” spokesman  Ernesto Duran 
said today by phone.  
 “Sara Lee and the others are now trying to piggyback the
system that Nestle has taken decades to establish with the
associated high investment costs,” said  James Amoroso , a food-
industry consultant based in Walchwil, Switzerland.  
 Nestle  first sold single-serve espresso for machines that
don’t need cleaning 24 years ago. The Swiss company cultivates
an exclusive image for Nespresso through boutiques that boast
tasting salons in locations such as Paris’s Champs-Elysees and
via a magazine sent to the homes of some of its 7 million
Nespresso Club members twice a year.  
 French Sales  
 Sara Lee  has sold 12 million capsules since it introduced
the product in France two months ago, Duran said.  
 “We see no reason why Nespresso would take legal action
against us and are confident about the outcome of the
proceedings,” he said.  
 Ethical Coffee Co., which also started selling a compatible
version in France last month, and Sara Lee are the first to
offer alternatives to Nespresso capsules. Consumers who bought a
Nespresso machine previously were committed to using Nestle’s 16
“Grand Cru” and limited-edition varieties, sold only in the
boutiques and online.  
 Ethical Coffee capsules use a water seal that doesn’t
infringe Nespresso’s patents, Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Paul Gaillard  said today by phone.  
 Nestle hasn’t taken legal action against Fribourg,
Switzerland-based Ethical Coffee, spokesman Soygenis said.
