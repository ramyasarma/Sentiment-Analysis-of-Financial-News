             Japan’s 10-year  bonds  fell, pushing
yields toward a one-week high, as signs the global economy is
recovering damped demand for the relative safety of debt.  
 Bond futures dropped for the first time in three days after
reports showed demand for services rose in Japan and
manufacturing in the New York region gained for an 11th month.
Losses in bonds were tempered as an auction of 20-year
securities drew the strongest demand in more than two decades.  
 “It’s not surprising that investors are buying stocks and
selling bonds when you think about overall economic
fundamentals,” said  Osamu Koizumi , who helps oversee the
equivalent of $7.4 billion as chief investment officer at Yasuda
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “I’m not concerned much about
the global economy.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 rose one
basis point to 1.235 percent as of 3:40 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.089 yen to 100.578 yen. Yields climbed to 1.245
on June 11, the highest level since June 4.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery slipped 0.14
to 140.28 at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average gained 1.8 percent.  
 Ten-year yields may climb to 1.40 percent by the end of
September, Yasuda’s Koizumi said. If his forecast proves
accurate, investors who buy the securities today will incur a
1.1 percent loss, Bloomberg calculations show.  
 Tertiary Index  
 Japan’s tertiary index, which captures 63 percent of the
economy, gained 2.1 percent in April after falling 3 percent in
March, the Trade Ministry said today. The Federal Reserve Bank
of New York said yesterday its general economic index of
manufacturing rose at a faster pace in June. U.S. industrial
production climbed 0.9 percent last month, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the Federal Reserve report today.  
 “It’s getting clear that risk appetite is recovering
gradually after risk aversion dominated markets in May,”
 Chotaro Morita , head of fixed-income strategy research at
Barclays Capital, wrote today in a note to clients.  
 Today’s 20-year sale drew bids for 4.60 times the amount on
offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.93 times at
the previous auction in May. That was the highest ratio since
September 1987.  
 The lowest price at the auction was 99.90 yen, matching the
median estimate of 14 traders in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Few people think short-, mid-term yields will rise as it
takes much longer time before major central banks implement exit
strategies,”  said  Satoshi Yamada , manager of fixed-income
trading in Tokyo at Okasan Asset Management Co., which manages
$10 billion in assets. “Investors with abundant cash don’t have
a choice but to buy longer-term bonds. The auction’s results
make sense.”  
 Twenty-year yields rose one basis point to 1.975 percent.
Thirty-year yields gained one basis point to 2.055 percent.
