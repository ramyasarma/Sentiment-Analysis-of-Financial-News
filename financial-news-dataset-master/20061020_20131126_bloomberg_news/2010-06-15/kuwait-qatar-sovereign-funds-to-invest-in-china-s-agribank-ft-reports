             Sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and
Qatar have agreed to purchase $1 billion of shares each in
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. before the company begins
marketing its initial offering to institutional investors, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information. Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte has yet to decide
how much to invest in the bank, the FT said.
