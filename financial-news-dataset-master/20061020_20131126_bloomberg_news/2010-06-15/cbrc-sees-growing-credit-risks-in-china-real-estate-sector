             China’s banking regulator said it
sees growing credit risks in the nation’s real-estate industry.
Risks associated with home mortgages and building and the risk
of a chain effect may reappear in real-estate development loans,
the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in its annual
report published on its website today.
