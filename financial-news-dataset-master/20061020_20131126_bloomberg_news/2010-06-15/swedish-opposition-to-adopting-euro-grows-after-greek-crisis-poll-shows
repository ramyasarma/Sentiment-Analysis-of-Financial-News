             Swedish opposition to adopting the
euro grew this month after the region’s debt crisis sent the
single currency down to a four-year low on concern the European
Union’s fiscal challenges may be too great to resolve.  
 Of those surveyed, 60 percent would vote against and 27.8
percent for euro adoption, according to the bi-annual poll
published by Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  on its website
today. Sweden surveyed 6,135 people from April 28 to May 30. In
November, 43.8 percent of those polled said they wanted to join
Europe’s single currency, while 42 percent were opposed.  
 Concern about the euro’s sustainability has spread as the
region struggles to revise fiscal rules to avert a repeat of the
current debt crisis. Greece’s budget deficit stood at 13.6
percent of gross domestic product last year, more than four
times the European Union’s 3 percent limit. Sweden, which the
European Commission says boasts the EU’s smallest deficit at 0.5
percent of GDP last year, rejected the euro in a 2003 referendum.  
 The government of Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt , which
wants to join the euro, has said it won’t call a vote until the
largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, supports the
currency switch.
