             Thai rice export cancellations and
delays may drop from a two-year high of as much as 200,000
metric tons as prices stabilize, the  Thai Rice Exporters
Association  said.  
 “Defaults will slow in the second half,”  Chookiat Ophaswongse , the association’s adviser and former president,
said in a phone interview today. Thailand is the largest grower
and exporter, representing 32 percent of global  trade , and the
affected shipments total as much as 2.5 percent of exports.  
 The agreements may have defaulted when buyers who booked
deliveries earlier in the year canceled, delayed or tried to
renegotiate them as prices fell to the lowest level in more than
two years, Chookiat said. Most were in April and May, when the
price tumbled by $100 a ton from the start of the year, he said.  
 Thai rice prices, the benchmark for Asia, dropped 23
percent this year to $469 a ton on June 9, as import demand
subsided and a weakening local currency made Thai exports
cheaper, the association said. The price averaged $466.25 a ton
in February 2008, according to the association’s  data .  
 Rice futures on the Chicago Board of Trade have plunged 25
percent this year. The July-delivery contract was unchanged at
$11.195 per 100 pounds at 3:16 p.m. Singapore time.  
 The canceled or delayed shipments of as much as 200,000
tons are the highest since 2008, when prices jumped to a record
$1,038 a ton, prompting the cancellation of about 500,000 tons,
Chookiat said. The defaults this year covered white and
parboiled shipments mainly to Africa, representing about half of
Thailand’s exports.  
 Prices to Rebound  
 “Thai prices are near the bottom and will probably rebound
to around $500 to $520 a ton by the end of the year as import
demand picks up and  supplies  in many countries are limited
because of drought,” said Chookiat. “Deals taking place around
now are unlikely to default as prices have been stable. Only
outstanding deals agreed earlier are at risk,” he said.  
 Drought is spreading across 42 of Thailand’s provinces,
mostly in the north and northeast, which are major planting
areas for rice and sugar, according to the farm ministry’s
website. Drought linked to the El Nino weather pattern affected
a swathe of Asia this year, damaging crops from southern China
to Southeast Asia.  
 Production of the main crop starting October may decline
4.3 percent from an earlier forecast to 22 million tons because
of drought, Apichart Jongskul, secretary-general of Thailand’s
Office of Agricultural Economics, said on May 13. Thailand’s
main crop represents 75 percent of total production.  
 Exports this year may total 8 million to 8.5 million tons,
lower than the 9.5 million tons predicted earlier this year,
said Chookiat. Exports totaled 8.57 million tons in 2009.
