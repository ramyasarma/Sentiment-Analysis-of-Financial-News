             Spain’s government aims to increase
renewable-energy production by about 67 percent during the
decade, even as it reduces subsidies for clean power, according
to a  draft proposal .  
 Generation capacity will climb to 70 gigawatts by 2020 from
42 gigawatts this year, according to projections in the plan to
be presented this month to the European Commission. A gigawatt
can power about a million washing machines.  
 Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  is counting on
investors to continue building new solar and wind-power
installations even as he plans to reduce subsidies for the
generators, which currently can earn as much as about 10 times
more for their power than utilities that burn fossil fuels.  
 The plan will see Spain exceed the European Union target of
producing 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by the
decade’s end. Spain will meet 23 percent of total energy demand
and generate 40 percent of its electricity without emitting
carbon dioxide by 2020, the industry ministry draft said.  
 Spanish Industry Minister  Miguel Sebastian  plans to meet
with executives of renewable-energy companies and government
officials this week as he prepares a final proposal for cutting
prices paid for clean energy, a ministry spokesman said
yesterday.  
 Solar energy will almost triple to 13.4 gigawatts from 4.7
gigawatts, while wind energy will reach 38 gigawatts from 20.2
gigawatts, including 3 gigawatts in offshore generators.  
 The overall target is 7 percent lower than the 75-gigawatt
goal the government set out in April talks with the main
opposition People’s Party, according to  Europa Press .
