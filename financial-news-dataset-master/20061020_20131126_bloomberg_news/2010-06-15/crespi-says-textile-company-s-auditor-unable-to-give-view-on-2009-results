             Giovanni Crespi SpA, an Italian
maker of synthetic textiles, said auditor Mazars SpA was unable
to express an opinion on its 2009 results.
 Mazars wrote in a report that Crespi’s ability to 
realize its business plan depends on banks’ willingness to
renegotiate their positions, the Legnano-based company said late
yesterday in a statement.
