             Development costs for the Rafale jet
for Abu Dhabi may reach between 4 billion and 5 billion euros,
French daily La Tribune reported, citing unidentified people.  
 Abu Dhabi will fund half of the cost at most, La Tribune
said. The rest will be shared between Dassault Aviation SA,
Thales SA and Safran SA in line with their project stakes of
around 37.5 percent, 37.5 percent and 25 percent respectively,
according to the newspaper.
