             Italy’s FTSE MIB Index rose for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in more than two months,

 The following stocks were among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM) gained for a seventh session,
rising 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 7.44 euros. Deutsche Bank
AG upgraded Italy’s largest independent fund manager to “buy”
from “hold.” The brokerage, which trimmed its price estimate
to 10 euros from 10.1 euros, said in a note that “Azimut’s
share price is not discounting the company’s growth” it
forecast for 2011 and 2012.  
 Banco Popolare SC  (BP IM) gained 9.25 cents, or 2.6
percent, to 3.63 euros, tracking gains by banks in Europe.
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) and  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM), Italy’s
biggest banks, advanced 7 cents, or 3.1 percent, to 2.31 euros
and 7.3 cents, or 4 percent, to 1.91 euros, respectively.  
 Geox SpA  (GEO IM) dropped for the first session in five,
losing 10.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to 3.99 euros. UBS AG

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, advanced 14.75 cents,
or 3 percent, to 5.11 euros. British Sky Broadcasting Plc shares
rose as much as 22 percent in London trading after the U.K.’s

 Safilo Group SpA  (SFL IM) jumped 49 cents, or 6.1 percent,
to 8.59 euros, extending gains of 3.2 percent yesterday. “The

positive, given the poor track record in Safilo cash generation
in the last few years,” Equita Sim SpA said in a note. The
brokerage has a “hold” rating on the world’s second-largest
maker of eyewear.  
 Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) gained 59 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
