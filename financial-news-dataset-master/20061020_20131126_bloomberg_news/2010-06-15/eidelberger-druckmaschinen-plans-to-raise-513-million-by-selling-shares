             Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG , a
maker of printing presses, is planning a capital increase to
raise about 420 million euros ($513 million).  
 It intends to issue up to 156 million new no-par value
shares, the Heidelberg, Germany-based company said in a
statement today. It will seek shareholder approval at its July
29 general shareholders’ meeting, the company said in a
statement.  
 Commerzbank AG and Deutsche Bank AG will underwrite the
issue, Heidelberger said.  
 In April, the company posted a fourth-quarter preliminary
operating profit excluding special items of 11 million euros,
compared with a loss of 13 million euros in the third quarter.
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen said in March that it planned to
shed as many as 850 administrative, sales and production jobs
worldwide to lower costs by about 80 million euros a year.
