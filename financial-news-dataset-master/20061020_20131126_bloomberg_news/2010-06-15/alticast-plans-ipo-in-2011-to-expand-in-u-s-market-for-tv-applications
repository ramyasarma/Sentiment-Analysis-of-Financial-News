             Alticast Corp. , a South Korean maker
of software that connects televisions to the Internet, is
planning an initial public offering in the first half of next
year to help fund its expansion in the Americas.  
 Alticast, based in Seoul, would be listed either on the
Korean Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market, Alticast Americas
Chief Executive Officer David Housman said in an interview
today. The size of the IPO and where the shares will be listed
hasn’t been determined, he said. PineBridge Investments, which
recently was purchased by Pacific Century Group, is an adviser.  
 Alticast built its business on technology that makes cable
set-top boxes, video players, TVs and cable systems compatible
with each other and Internet connections. The company is
developing an application that allows customers to use the
Twitter messaging service on their TVs and has signed  Time
Warner Cable Inc.  and  Cablevision Systems Corp.  as clients.  
 “The public offering is purely a growth strategy to help
continue our efforts, especially in the U.S.,” he said. The
company plans to double its U.S. staff by early 2011 as its
technology gains momentum.  
 Housman projects the Americas division will reap $8 million
to $10 million in sales this year and is set to double next year
as the company signs new  contracts .  
 Researcher GigaOM Pro calculates that by 2015, six of 10
TVs shipped worldwide will have an Internet connection, and 70
percent of those will come with applications and an application
store.
