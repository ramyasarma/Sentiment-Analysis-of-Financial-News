             OAO Siberian Coal Energy Co.,
Russia’s largest producer of coal for power stations, is set to
delay an initial public offering to as late as October from July
as markets fluctuate, two people familiar with the matter said.  
 The company, known as SUEK, postponed marketing that was
scheduled for this week, signaling the offer will be pushed back
until the next opportunity in September or October, according to
the people, who declined to be identified because a decision
hasn’t been announced.  
 Alexei Naumenko , a spokesman for SUEK in Moscow, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  
 The company, valued at as much as $10 billion at the start
of the year, planned to sell a stake of 10 percent to 25 percent
in Moscow and London in July. The IPO would have been the
second-largest Russian equity offering this year, after  United
Co. Rusal Ltd.  raised $2.24 billion in Hong Kong in January.
