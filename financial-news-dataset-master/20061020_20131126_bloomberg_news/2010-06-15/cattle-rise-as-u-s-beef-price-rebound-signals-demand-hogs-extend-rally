             Cattle futures rose for a second
straight day as wholesale-beef prices rebounded, signaling U.S.
retail demand may be improving. Hogs also gained.  
 Wholesale  choice-beef  prices climbed 1.1 percent at midday
to $1.5481 a pound, snapping a 19-session slide, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Yesterday, prices were the lowest
since March, which may spur grocer buying before the U.S.
Independence Day holiday, when many Americans grill outdoors,
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.  
 “The boxed-beef market has fallen apart, but it feels like
we may be at a point of some stability, as the packer is killing
now for the Fourth of July weekend,” Roose said from West Des
Moines, Iowa.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery increased 0.475 cent, or
0.5 percent, to 88.6 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price has climbed 9.6 percent in the past year.
Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained 0.55 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $1.10975 a pound.  
 Cattle also were supported as the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  advanced as much as 2 percent, and the  dollar  fell to a
two-week low against major currencies, boosting the appeal of
U.S. meat exports, said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of Vetterkind
Cattle Brokerage in Chicago.  
 The USDA may report this week that feedlot  purchases  of
young cattle surged 20 percent in May from a year earlier, as
profits rebounded from losses in 2009, Vetterkind said. Heavier
cattle placed into feedlots in May will be ready for slaughter
by late August.  
 Hog Market  
 Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.6 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 82.375 cents a pound on the CME. Earlier, futures
declined as much as 0.9 percent.  
 Hogs were supported by the lower dollar, said Roose, of
U.S. Commodities. Hog “numbers are still really tight,” which
may lead meatpackers to raise bids for supplies, he said.
Futures have jumped 41 percent in the past year as losses
spurred farmers to cut herds.  
 Wholesale pork  dropped to 82.73 cents a pound yesterday,
the lowest level since April 14, USDA data show. The price of
 hogs for immediate delivery  to meatpackers fell 1.1 percent
yesterday to 74.7 cents a pound. Processors are earning about
$10 per head in profits, because the cost of spot-hog purchases
has declined with wholesale pork, Roose said.
