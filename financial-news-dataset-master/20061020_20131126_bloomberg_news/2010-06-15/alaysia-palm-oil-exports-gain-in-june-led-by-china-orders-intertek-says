             Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the
world’s second-largest producer, climbed 1 percent in the first
15 days of June, led by Chinese orders, according to market
surveyor Intertek.  
 A total of 600,921 metric tons were tracked from June 1 to
15 compared with 591,887 tons in the same period in May,
Intertek said in an e-mailed statement in Kuala Lumpur.  
 Exports to China, the biggest user of edible oils, rose to
206,450 tons from 161,700 tons in May, while shipments to India
and the subcontinent dropped to 62,202 tons from 86,230 tons,
the data showed. Exports to Europe, the second-largest
