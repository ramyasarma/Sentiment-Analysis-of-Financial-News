             New Zealand’s  consumer confidence 
rebounded in the second quarter following a decline in the
nation’s unemployment rate, Westpac Banking Corp. and McDermott
Miller Ltd. said in a report today.  
 The household sentiment index climbed to 119.3 from 114.7
in the first three months of the year, Westpac said in a faxed
statement. A reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber
pessimists. The result is above the long-term average of 111.6.  
 Rising sentiment comes after the  jobless rate  fell in the
first quarter by the most since at least 1986, and the central
bank last week raised borrowing costs for the first time in
three years as it seeks to control inflation. The boost in
confidence also reflects higher income for the dairy industry
and tax cuts announced by the government during the period,
Westpac said.  
 “The rebound in confidence is great news for the N.Z.
economy,” Westpac economist  Donna Purdue  said in the statement.
“Consumer spending has been a notable weak spot in the economic
recovery so far this year.”  
 The survey, conducted between June 1 and June 13, has a
margin of error of 2.5 percent, the bank said. The sample of
1,559 households had a response rate of 41.2 percent, it said.
