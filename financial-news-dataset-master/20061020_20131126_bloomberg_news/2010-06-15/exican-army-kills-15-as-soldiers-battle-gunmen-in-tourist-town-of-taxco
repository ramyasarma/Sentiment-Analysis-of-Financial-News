             Mexican soldiers confronted an armed
group today in the city of Taxco, killing as many as 15 people,
the state attorney general said.  
 “They’re verifying between 14 and 15 people killed in this
clash,” Guerrero state Attorney General Albertico Guinto said,
according to an audio recording of his remarks e-mailed by his
 office .  
 He said the soldiers were carrying out a search operation
in the town, which is popular with tourists for its historic
role in the silver trade.  
 Separately, a police chief and his 26-year-old son were
killed early this morning in Cuernavaca, about 50 miles from
Mexico City, from gunshots to the head, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Morelos state attorney general’s office.  
 Mexican President  Felipe Calderon  has said he won’t back
down from his strategy of confronting drug cartels with army and
police personnel, even as violence spiked this month. In a
 letter  dated June 13, Calderon defended his four-year war on
organized crime, saying the fight is a necessary sacrifice and
an “ethical obligation.”
