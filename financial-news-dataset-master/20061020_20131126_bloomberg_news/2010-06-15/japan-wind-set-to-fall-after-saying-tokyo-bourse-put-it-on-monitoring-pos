             Japan Wind Development Co. shares
were untraded and poised to fall after the wind-power developer
said it will be placed on a so-called monitoring post by the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.   
 The shares were offered at 167,600 yen as of 9:17 a.m. in
pre-market trading, lower than yesterday’s close of 183,600 yen.  
 The company is likely to fail to meet a TSE deadline to
file its earnings auditing report because it changed its
auditor, it said in a filing after markets closed yesterday.
