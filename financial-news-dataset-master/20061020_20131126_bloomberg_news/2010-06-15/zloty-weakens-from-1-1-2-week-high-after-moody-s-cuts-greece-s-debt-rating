             The Polish zloty retreated from its
strongest level in 1 1/2 weeks after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Greece’s credit rating, stoking concern Europe’s debt
crisis may worsen.  
 The zloty lost 0.4 percent to 4.0852 per euro as of 9:15
a.m. in Warsaw after appreciating to the strongest level since
June 3 yesterday. It lost the most among 25 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Bond prices fell pushing the
yield on five-year notes 3 basis points higher to 5.28 percent.  
 Moody’s yesterday cut Greece’s credit rating to junk,
citing “substantial” risks to the nation’s economic growth
from the austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134
billion) aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund. The euro dropped against the dollar
before a report that may show investor confidence in Germany,
Europe’s largest economy, fell to the lowest in almost a year.  
 “Moody’s decision last night to cut Greece’s rating to
junk may cool European investors’ optimism and their sentiment
will worsen,” Bank BPH SA economists in Warsaw wrote in a note
to clients. The zloty may weaken to around 4.10 per euro,
according to BPH.  
 The 16 European countries that share the euro accounted for
55.8 percent of Polish exports in the first four months of this
year, according to the  statistics office’s website.
