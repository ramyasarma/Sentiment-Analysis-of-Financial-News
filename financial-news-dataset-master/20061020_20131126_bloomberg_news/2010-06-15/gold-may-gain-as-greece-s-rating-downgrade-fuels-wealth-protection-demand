             Gold may gain in New York as concern
that the global economic recovery may slow boosts demand for the
precious metal as a means of protecting wealth.  
 German investor confidence plunged the most since October
2008 on concern that the sovereign debt crisis will undermine
export prospects and crimp growth in Europe’s largest economy.
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut Greece’s credit rating.
Bullion is trading within 2.3 percent of a record set last week.  
 Gold is trading “with greater consideration of its safe-
haven status,” Barclays Capital analyst  Xin Yi Chen  said today
in a report. The metal is “on one hand supported by lingering
worries over sovereign debt issues and on the other lacking
fresh momentum to break significantly on the upside.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August added $1.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,225.70 an ounce at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.2 percent
higher at $1,224.20 an ounce.  
 The metal was little changed at $1,223 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from $1,223.75 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 “Deteriorating public finances, anaemic economic growth
and sovereign debt and currency concerns should lead to
continuing safe-haven demand for gold,” analysts at Dublin-
based broker  GoldCore Ltd.  said today in a report.  
 The Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European Economic
Research said today its index of investor and analyst
expectations slumped to 28.7 in June from 45.8 in May.
Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast a drop to 42.  
 Greece Downgrade  
 Bullion has jumped 12 percent this year, climbing to a
record $1,254.50 an ounce on June 8, and is headed for a 10th
straight annual advance, the longest run of gains since at least
1920. The metal has climbed amid speculation that debt-cutting
measures by European nations will slow growth.  
 Moody’s yesterday cut Greece’s credit rating to junk,
citing “substantial” risks to the nation’s economic growth
from the austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro ($134
billion) aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund.  
 “Gold is viewed more as a universal currency with its
safe-haven, last-resort properties,” said  Bayram Dincer , a
commodity analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,
Switzerland. Gold may be supported by the Greece downgrade, he
said.  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged for a second day
at a record 1,306.14 metric tons yesterday, according to figures
on the company’s website. Global  holdings  added 3.24 tons to an
all-time high 2,039.92 tons yesterday, according to Bloomberg
data tracking 10 providers.  
 Silver for July delivery in New York was little changed at
$18.41 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery lost 0.4 percent to
$1,557.50 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery declined
0.3 percent to $461.05 an ounce.
