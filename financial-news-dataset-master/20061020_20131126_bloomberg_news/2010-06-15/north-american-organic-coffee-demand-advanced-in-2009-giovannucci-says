             Imports of organic coffee into the
U.S. and Canada exceeded 93 million pounds last year and demand
is rising, said market researcher Daniele Giovannucci, citing a
survey of 56 retailers and roasters.  
 The $1.4 billion organic-coffee market expanded by 4.1
percent this past year and an average 21 percent annually for
the past five years, compared with estimated 1 percent growth in
the “conventional coffee industry,” Giovannucci said in a
 statement  on the PRWeb website.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters
Inc.  was among the companies surveyed, according to Giovannucci.  
 Coffee is labeled organic when it is grown without toxic
fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic hormones and
genetic engineering, according to the  Organic Trade Association .
Organic food is also minimally processed without artificial
ingredients, preserves or irradiation, the Greenfield,
Massachusetts-based group said.
