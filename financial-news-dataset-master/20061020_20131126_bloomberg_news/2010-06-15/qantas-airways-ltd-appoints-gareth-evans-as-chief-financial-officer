             Qantas Airways Ltd.,  Australia’s
largest carrier, promoted  Gareth Evans  to chief financial
officer, a role he has been performing since  Colin Storrie 
resigned in March.  
 Evans will now supervise finances for all business
units after previously having responsibility for only the
Qantas airline division, Sydney-based Qantas said in a
statement today. Storrie announced his resignation March 2,
citing “personal and health reasons.”  
 As CFO, Evans may oversee financing for the more than
160 planes the carrier, which flies under its own name and
the Jetstar budget service, has on order. Qantas, one of only
three publicly traded airlines with an investment grade
credit rating from Standard & Poor’s, has A$3.2 billion ($2.8
billion) of  bonds and loans  maturing by 2020, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Gareth was appointed after a search process that
considered a very strong internal and external field,” Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  said in the statement.  
 Evans joined the company in 1999 after holding finance
roles with Caltex Australia Ltd. and KPMG in the U.K.  
 Qantas  shares  rose 3.3 percent to A$2.47 at the close of
trading in Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index advanced
1.2 percent.  
 The airline is rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s, the same
ranking as Southwest Airlines Co. Deutsche Lufthansa AG,
which is rated BBB-, is the only other carrier with an
investment grade rating, according to Bloomberg data.
