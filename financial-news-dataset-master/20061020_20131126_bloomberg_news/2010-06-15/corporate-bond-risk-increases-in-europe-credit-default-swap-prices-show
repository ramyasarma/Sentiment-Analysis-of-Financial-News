             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose to a two-week high, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 30.6
basis points to 576.6, the highest since June 14, according to
Markit Group Ltd. prices at 11 a.m. in London. The index is a
gauge for the cost of protecting bonds against default and an
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 6.4 basis points to 130.9, Markit
prices show.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
