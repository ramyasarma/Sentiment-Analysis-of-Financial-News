             Google Inc. ’s collection of data via
Wi-Fi networks was the subject of a conference call among law
enforcement officials from 30 U.S. states, according to
Connecticut Attorney General  Richard Blumenthal .  
 “We’re looking to establish where, when, why, for how long
and for what purpose there was this collection of information on
wireless networks,” Blumenthal said yesterday in an interview.
The call included representatives of the states’ attorneys
general.  
 The discussion reflects widening concern among law
enforcement over the way  Google  handles user information. The
company said last month it mistakenly gathered data from open
wireless networks while it was capturing images of streets and
houses for its Street View service, a product that lets users
view photographs of an area online.  
 Blumenthal has demanded that Mountain View, California-
based Google inform his office of any data gathered from his
state’s residents and businesses without permission, the
attorney general said this month. Google owns the world’s
largest  search engine .  
 “This was a mistake, but we don’t believe we did anything
illegal,” Google said in an e-mailed statement. “We’re working
with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and
concerns.”  
 Illinois was among the states that joined in last week’s
call led by Blumenthal.

 “We did participate in a conference call with other
attorneys general regarding Google,” said Robyn Ziegler, a
spokeswoman for Illinois Attorney General  Lisa Madigan .
Additional information wasn’t immediately available, she said.  
 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said last month that it
is reviewing Google’s data gathering. An Oregon judge has
ordered the company turn over similar data collected in that
state, including any e-mails, files or digital phone records,
according to court documents.  
 Also this month, Google said it was turning over to
regulators in Germany, France and Spain data it mistakenly
collected from unsecured Wi-Fi networks.  
 Those countries are investigating Google’s data-gathering
practices after the company said in May that its cars used to
photograph roadsides for its Street View mapping service
inadvertently recorded information.  
 Prosecutors in the German city of Hamburg opened a criminal
investigation. Authorities in Italy, Canada and the Czech
Republic also have begun inquiries.  
 The Oregon case is Vicki Van Valin v. Google, 10-00557,
U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Portland).
