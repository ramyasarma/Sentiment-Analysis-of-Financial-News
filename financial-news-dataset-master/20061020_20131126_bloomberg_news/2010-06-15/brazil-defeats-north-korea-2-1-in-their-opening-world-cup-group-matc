             Brazil, the record five-time
champion, beat North Korea 2-1 in their soccer World Cup Group G
match today in Johannesburg, South Africa.  
 Maicon scored Brazil’s opener from a tight angle after 55
minutes, with Elano doubling his team’s lead in the 72nd minute.
Ji Yun-Nam replied for the Koreans after 89 minutes.  
 Brazil, the only team to appear at all 19 World Cup
tournaments, is aiming to win the title for a first time since
2002. North Korea is making its first appearance since 1966.  
 Portugal tied 0-0 with Ivory Coast in the opening game of
the group earlier today. New Zealand tied 1-1 against Slovakia
in Group F.  
 Brazil, the top-ranked team by soccer’s governing body
FIFA, dominated the early stages today at Ellis Park, but the
lowest-ranked team in the tournament kept them at bay and
started to create opportunities on the break.  
 Brazil, driven forward by Robinho, was mainly restricted to
long shots, with Jong Tae-Se providing a threat for the Koreans.  
 North Korea’s resistance was finally ended after 55
minutes, Maicon collecting the ball in the penalty area before
squeezing it past the goalkeeper at his near post.  
 Elano fired in the second goal on 72 minutes and Brazil now
appeared to be coasting against a team ranked No. 105 by FIFA.
North Korea was, though, able to celebrate a goal just before
the end.
