             Jupiter Investment Management
Holdings Ltd., the money manager run by  Edward Bonham Carter , is
seeking to price shares in an initial sale at below the mid-
point of its original range, the terms of the offering show.  
 Jupiter narrowed the price range for its shares to 160
pence to 170 pence apiece as it aims to raise about 275 million
pounds ($405 million) including secondary proceeds, according to
a term sheet for the sale obtained by Bloomberg News. The
London-based company previously offered stock at 150 pence to
210 pence.  
 The money manager is going ahead with its share sale after
sovereign-debt downgrades spurred at least 33 companies from
London-based  Ferrous Resources Ltd.  to the Chinese wind-turbine
maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. to shelve IPOs.  
 JPMorgan Cazenove and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are
managing the sale, along with Numis. The book for investor
orders is scheduled to close at 2 p.m. in London today,
according to the document.  
 If Jupiter sells shares at 165 pence apiece, it will be
valued at about 11.2 times its estimated earnings for 2010,
according to Execution Nobel Ltd. analysts  Nitin Arora  and Sri
Karthik Velamakanni. That’s lower than Henderson Group Plc’s
ratio of 13.3 and Schroders Plc’s valuation at 16 times
estimated earnings, while  Gartmore Group Ltd.  has a ratio of
7.9, according to the research.  
 Assets Under Management  
 Jupiter had 19.5 billion pounds of assets under management
at the end of December. About 86 percent of Jupiter’s are in
equities, with about 13 percent in fixed income. The firm had
earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 91.3 million
pounds on revenue of 182.2 million pounds in 2009.  
 John Duffield  founded Jupiter in 1985 to manage money for
himself and his friend  David Astor , and later added mutual fund
clients. Duffield made 200 million pounds when he sold the firm
to Commerzbank AG 15 years later, before quitting to start New
Star Asset Management Group Plc. Commerzbank sold Jupiter to its
managers and TA Associates for 740 million pounds in 2007.
