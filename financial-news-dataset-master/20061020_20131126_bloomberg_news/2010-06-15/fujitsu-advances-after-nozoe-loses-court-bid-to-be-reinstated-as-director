             Fujitsu Ltd. , Japan’s biggest
provider of computer services, rose in Tokyo trading after
former President  Kuniaki Nozoe  lost a court bid to be reinstated
as a director at the company.  
 Fujitsu gained 0.5 percent to 572 yen as of 9:11 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  dropped 0.5 percent.  
 A Yokohama court rejected Nozoe’s petition on grounds that
the 62-year-old stepped down voluntarily, according to a
statement by Nozoe’s lawyers yesterday.  
 “Fujitsu views this decision as a validation by the court
of all aspects of the company’s assertions,” the Tokyo-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.
