             Aluminum may continue to fall toward
$1,743 a metric ton, according to technical analysis by Barclays
Capital, implying a potential 12 percent drop from current
prices.  
 The attached chart shows that while the lightweight metal
rose above its April-to-June downward trend line, prices may
decline toward the September and October lows of about $1,776 a
ton. A drop to $1,743 would equal a 61.8 percent retracement of
the rally from February 2009 to April this year, one of the
levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  
 “Despite the recent strength, we continue to think that
higher prices are a corrective process which, when complete,
should lead to renewed weakness toward $1,776/$1,743 in the
weeks ahead,” Barclays analysts including  MacNeil Curry  wrote
in a report. “Bigger picture, it would take a move back through
the 200-day moving average to indicate basing.”  
 Aluminum  for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained 3.4 percent last week, the first weekly climb in
a month, and traded at $1,991 a ton at 10:31 a.m. local time
today. The metal, used in industries from packaging to
aerospace, is down 11 percent this year. Its 200-day moving
average is at about $2,098.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.
