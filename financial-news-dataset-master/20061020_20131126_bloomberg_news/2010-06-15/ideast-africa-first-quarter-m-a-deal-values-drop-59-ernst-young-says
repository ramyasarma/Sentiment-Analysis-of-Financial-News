             Merger and acquisition values in the
Middle East and North Africa region fell 59 percent to $6.5
billion in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, Ernst
& Young said in a report e-mailed today.  
 The number of deals announced fell 16 percent to 76 in the
same period, it said. Egypt attracted 10 agreements, followed by
Saudi Arabia with eight, Qatar and Jordan each with four.  
 “The M&A activity levels in Egypt reflect the potential
and great vibrancy within its economy, which will continue to be
maintained in the coming quarters,”  Phil Gandier , head of
transaction advisory services at Ernst &  Young Middle East , said
in the report.  
 Qatar attracted 39 percent of merger and acquisition
activity in the region with deals valued at $1.08 billion,
followed by Lebanon with $450 million and Saudi Arabia with
$381.4 million, the report said.  
 Banking and capital markets was the most sought-after
sector with deals valued at $916.2 million, followed by real
estate with $887 million and asset management with $383 million.  
 “The region is traditionally known for the predominance of
financial and real estate companies in M&A activity,” said
Gandier in the report. “Industrial and core sectors remain
contenders for either government divestment or global
expansion.”
