             U.S. stock futures advanced,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may rebound towards
its 200-day moving average, a key level watched by some traders,
before reports that may show the recovery is continuing.  
 News Corp. might be active after the company’s 7.8 billion-
pound ($11.5 billion) offer to buy British Sky Broadcasting Plc
was rejected by the U.K. pay-TV provider. Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Chevron Corp. climbed in Germany as crude oil rose. Hershey Co.
may also move after the chocolate maker forecast earnings in
line with analysts’ estimates.  
 Futures  on the  S&P 500  expiring in September rose 0.5
percent to 1,091.7 as of 12:27 p.m. in London after the
benchmark for U.S. stocks yesterday slipped 0.2 percent. Futures
on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 0.5 percent to
10,187, while Nasdaq-100 Index futures climbed 0.6 percent to
1,857.  
 “I think today’s move is largely technical,” said London-
based David Morrison, a market strategist at GFT. “U.S. traders
will try and take the S&P 500 up through the 200-day moving
average at 1,108. It feels like equities will try to push higher
regardless” of the outcome of today’s economic reports.  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday, extending the  S&P 500 ’s retreat
from April to 10 percent, after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Greece’s credit rating to junk, halting an earlier
rally of as much as 1.3 percent.  
 Spain, Portugal  
 Futures pared gains of as much as 0.8 percent today after
the European Commission said in a draft document that Spain and
Portugal need additional budget cuts to meet deficit targets
announced a month ago even as their efforts to tame their
shortfalls threaten to choke growth and produce a “snowball”
effect on their debt levels.  
 Factories in the  New York region  expanded for an 
11th month in May, economists said before a report due at 
8:30 a.m. local time. A report at the same time from the Labor 
Department  may show the import-price index dropped 1.3
percent in May, after an increase of 0.9 percent the prior
month, according to the median of economists surveyed.  
 European stocks advanced today, sending the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index  to its longest winning streak since March, as News
Corp.’s offer for BSkyB sparked a rally in media stocks and
helped offset a plunge in German investor confidence and
Greece’s rating downgrade.  
 German Confidence  
 The Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European Economic
research said its index of investor and analyst expectations,
which aims to predict developments six months ahead, slumped to
28.7 from 45.8 in May. That compares to economists forecast for
a drop to 42.  
 News Corp.’s shares may be active after BSkyB, the U.K.’s
largest pay-TV provider, spurned the company’s offer. The
British company said it may be prepared to accept an offer of
more than 800 pence a share after News Corp. offered 700 pence a
share for the 61 percent  stake  it doesn’t already own. BSkyB
shares soared 18 percent to 711 pence in London.  
 Exxon rose 1.1 percent to $62.02 in Germany, while Chevron
gained 0.8 percent to $74.80. Crude oil for July delivery
climbed 1.3 percent to $76.08 a barrel in electronic trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Hershey  may be active after the company said it expects
2010 adjusted profit of $2.47 to $2.52 a share. That compares to
analysts estimates of $2.49 a share.  
 The chocolate maker also announced plans to cut 500 to 600
jobs as investments in technology and automation result in
enhanced efficiency in a new plant.
