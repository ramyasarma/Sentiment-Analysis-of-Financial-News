             One out of five Americans over the
age of 65 has been the victim of a financial scam, according to
a survey by a nonprofit organization.  
 More than 7.3 million senior citizens have been taken
advantage of financially through inappropriate investments, high
fees or fraud, said the survey, which was released today by the
Washington-based  Investor  Protection Trust.  
 “We now know that a shockingly large number of older
Americans are already victims of financial swindles and millions
more are in danger of being exploited in such a fashion,” Don
Blandin, chief executive officer and president of Investor
Protection Trust, which promotes investor education, said in a
statement.  
 Forty percent of children who have parents age 65 and older
said they are “very” or “somewhat” worried that their
parents have already become or will become less able to handle
their personal finances over time.  
 Most American households at or near retirement “are
consumed by fear,” said Anthony Webb, associate director of
research at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. The
average 401(k) account balance as of March 31 was $66,900,
according to Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which has 11
million participants. The average monthly Social Security
benefit as of April was $1,067.  
 Almost 40 percent of survey respondents age 65 and over
said they’ve received phone calls or mailers asking for money
compared with 19 percent of adult children who said they believe
their parents are being pitched what the survey called schemes.  
 Basic Investment Knowledge  
 About 45 percent of respondents age 65 and over got at
least two out of four questions wrong about basic investment
knowledge -- they said that an investment registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities
regulators means it’s been reviewed to make sure it’s safe and
that a very high rate of return is only okay as long as the
investment is guaranteed or bonded.  
 “It is imperative that a serious national campaign be
launched to end rampant elder financial exploitation and to
protect and help vulnerable older victims,” Kathleen Quinn,
executive director of the National Adult Protective Services
Association, a national nonprofit, based in Springfield,
Illinois, said in a statement.  
 The survey was conducted in May among a sample of 2,022
adults age 18 and over by Infogroup Inc., a provider of market
research based in Omaha, Nebraska. The group included 706 adult
children with at least one parent age 65 and older and 590
adults who are age 65 and older.
