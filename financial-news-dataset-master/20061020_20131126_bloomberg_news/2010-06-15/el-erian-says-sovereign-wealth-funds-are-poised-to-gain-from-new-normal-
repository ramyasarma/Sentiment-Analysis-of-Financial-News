             Mohamed A. El-Erian , whose firm runs
the world’s biggest mutual fund, says sovereign wealth funds are
poised to profit from a reshaping of the global economy known as
the “new normal.”  
 “Although sovereign wealth funds were not able to
completely sidestep the global financial crisis, they have
recovered nicely and are well placed as a group to navigate the
journey to and through the new normal,” El-Erian, chief
executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in
Finance & Development Magazine, published by the International
Monetary Fund.  
 El-Erian, a former deputy director at the Washington-based
 IMF , forecasts that during the next three to five years the
world economy will undergo below-average economic growth, more
regulation and a higher natural rate of unemployment in what
Pimco, manager of $1.1 trillion in Newport Beach, California,
calls the “new normal.”  
 Sovereign wealth funds still carry risks, El-Erian said, as
investment managers are beholden to their government supervisors
who can be influenced by political forces. “Yet, given the
scale of ongoing and prospective changes in the global economy,
the alternative of backward-looking business as usual would be
even riskier,” he wrote.
