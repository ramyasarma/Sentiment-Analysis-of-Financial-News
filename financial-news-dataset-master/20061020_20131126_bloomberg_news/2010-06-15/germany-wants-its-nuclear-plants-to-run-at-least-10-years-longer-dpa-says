             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition wants to extend nuclear power generation by at least
10 years beyond the current planned phase-out of 2021, the  DPA 
newswire reported, citing a senior lawmaker.  
 Hans-Peter Friedrich , parliamentary leader of the Christian
Social Union, said coalition leaders today proposed a minimum
extension period but have yet to specify how long they plan to
run the country’s remaining plants, according to DPA.  
 Merkel’s government may make a formal decision on extending
the phase-out in August, DPA said.
