             Suraj Sudhakar sold pay-toilet
services in Kenya. Heidi Krauel peddled solar-powered lights in
India. Joel Montgomery pushed drip irrigation in Pakistan.  
 The three young college graduates are the subject of “ The
New Recruits ,” a fascinating  PBS  documentary airing tonight at
10 p.m. New York time. The film chronicles their yearlong
adventure with “social entrepreneurship,” a philosophy that
combines humanitarianism and capitalism to fight global poverty.  
 The trio was trained by the  Acumen Fund , a nonprofit group
that believes free enterprise is the best way to help Third
World countries. The film is narrated by Rainn Wilson of NBC’s
“ The Office ” and directed by Jeremy Newberger, Seth Kramer and
Daniel A. Miller, who earlier made “The Linguists.”  
 Sudhakar’s story is the most compelling -- and depressing.  
 In a slum outside Nairobi, pigs, dogs, chickens and humans
scurry across huge mounds of garbage. The area lacks a
sanitation system, making it what one local calls an “open
defecation zone.”  
 Sudhakar’s company,  Ecotact , installs pay toilets that cost
about eight cents per visit. A “World Toilet Day” featuring a
speech by Kenya’s minister of public health and sanitation is
held to publicize the facilities. A comedian entertains the
crowd with one-liners such as, “Did you just make a big one or
a small one?”  
 ‘Monsoon Money’  
 In order to create a high-class image, the company opens
the first toilets in the city’s business district. “Don’t
forget us,” pleads a small group of children in the slums.
Sudhakar promises to come back.  
 In Pakistan, Montgomery approaches his Micro Drip project
with the enthusiasm of an Amway salesman.  
 “A rainmaker is any person who brings money into a
company,” he tells his small sales team. “I want monsoon
money!”  
 But local farmers resist his pitch to install systems that
save water by using special pipes and valves to slowly irrigate
crops. Despite a spreadsheet presentation showing farmers they
would eventually save money, they’re reluctant to invest in a
system that doesn’t pay immediate dividends.  
 When he came to Pakistan, Montgomery was convinced that
free enterprise could solve any economic problem. After 10
months in the field, though, he concedes that “the market is
imperfect.”  
 Solar Power  
 Krauel worked for  D.light Design , trying to sell solar-
powered lights to some of the 500 million Indians “without
access to good electricity.” They currently rely on kerosene,
which can be dangerous.  
 Sales aren’t easy, though. Most Indians earn less than two
dollars a day, which makes it extremely difficult to afford a
solar system that costs $25.  
 Cost wasn’t Krauel’s only problem. The tall slender blonde
was disturbed by a billboard advertising a show called “I Hate
Working Women” and a newspaper story about a brutal gang rape.  
 “India is not a safe place to be a woman,” she concludes.  
 The film says only 50 percent of social entrepreneur jobs
survive their first four years. Yet by the end of the film,
Krauel and Montgomery are seeking new opportunities to sell to
the poor and Suhakar has enthusiastically returned to Kenya to
build more toilets.

                     Customers test a solar-powered light in the documentary "The New Recruit." The PBS-televised film follows three business students who attempt to establish self-sustaining service providers in impoverished areas of Pakistan, India and Kenya.
