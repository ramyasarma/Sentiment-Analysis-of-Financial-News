             Blue Financial Services Ltd., a
South African provider of unsecured loans, fell in Johannesburg
trading after saying it will post a fiscal full-year loss.  
 The stock of Pretoria-based Blue Financial slipped as much
as 6 cents, or 29 percent, to 15 cents by 9:33 a.m., the biggest
intraday drop since June 3. Blue Financial has lost 67 percent
over the past six months, reducing its market value to 93
million rand.  
 Blue Financial will report a loss of between 1 billion rand
and 1.05 billion rand for the year through February, the company
said in a statement.
