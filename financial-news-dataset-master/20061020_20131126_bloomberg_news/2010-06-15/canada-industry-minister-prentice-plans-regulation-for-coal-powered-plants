             Canadian Environment Minister  Jim Prentice  said he will make an announcement aiming to reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-powered energy facilities
within days.  
 “We’ll be moving forward to deal with emissions from coal
facilities, which is our second-largest source of emissions,”
Prentice told reporters today in Ottawa, adding the government
will deal with the issue through regulation. “We’ll be dealing
with this in the days ahead.”  
 Canada’s coal plants, which produce 13 percent of the
country’s greenhouse-gas emissions and about 19 percent of its
electricity, are “outdated and dirty,” Prentice said in a
speech. Thirty-three of the country’s 51 coal-burning units will
reach the end of their economic life by 2025, giving the country
the “opportunity to make the right choices,” he said.  
 The regulations will be part of Canada’s response to the
Copenhagen accord on greenhouse-gas emissions. Prentice
announced new rules for truck emissions last month and
harmonized the country’s automobile regulations with those of
the U.S. in April.  
 Because Canada relies less on coal for electricity than the
U.S. and its plants will need to be replaced sooner, Canada will
set its own rules instead of harmonizing with those of its
southern neighbor, Prentice said.  
 Prentice earlier told utility executives they won’t be
allowed to refurbish the coal-fired facilities unless their
emissions are captured and stored, the Globe and Mail reported
in April.
