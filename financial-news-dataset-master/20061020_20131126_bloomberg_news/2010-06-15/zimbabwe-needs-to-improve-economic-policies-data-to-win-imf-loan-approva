             Zimbabwe needs to improve its
economic policies and data reporting to make progress toward
approval for a loan from the  International Monetary Fund ,
according to the institution’s mission chief to the country.  
 “Improving the timeliness and quality of data reporting
and making further progress in economic policies would help to
move toward a staff monitored program, which is the stepping
stone to an IMF financial arrangement and debt relief,”  Vitaliy Kramarenko  said in an e-mailed statement after a June 2-10
mission to Harare.  
 Kramarenko also said the country’s economy is benefitting
from higher export prices and a good agriculture season, the IMF
said. He recommended that the authorities complete a current
government payroll audit, focus more on social policies and
improve the business climate.  
 Wages in both the public and private sector should be
restrained as inflation has recently picked-up, he said.  
 Zimbabwe, which has outstanding arrears of about $1.3
billion to the International Monetary Fund, African Development
Bank and World Bank, is struggling to attract foreign investment
and aid.
