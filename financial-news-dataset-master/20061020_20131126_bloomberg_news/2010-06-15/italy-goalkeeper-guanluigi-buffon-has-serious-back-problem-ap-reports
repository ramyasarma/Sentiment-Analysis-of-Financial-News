             Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi
Buffon has a “serious” back problem and it’s not clear when
he’ll be able to play again in the World Cup, the Associated
Press reported, citing team physician Enrico Castellacci.  
 Federico Marchetti came on in place of Buffon at halftime
in the 1-1 draw with Paraguay yesterday.  
 Castellacci said today that there’s a problem with the left
side of Buffon’s sciatic nerve, and that “at the moment, no
date can be set for his return,” the AP added.
