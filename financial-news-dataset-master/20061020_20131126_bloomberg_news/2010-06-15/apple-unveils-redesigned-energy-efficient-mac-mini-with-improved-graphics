             Apple Inc.  introduced a redesigned
Mac Mini, raising the price of its least-expensive Macintosh
personal computer by $100 after updating the chassis and making
it faster.  
 The Mac Mini, available today and priced from $699, is more
energy efficient, has a faster processor and graphics chips and
is built on an aluminum unibody frame, Apple said in a
statement. The 7.7-inch square computer is sold without a
monitor, keyboard or mouse. Previous models started at $599.  
 Apple, the world’s  most valuable  technology company, is
looking to expand its flagship Mac business even as it promotes
the iPhone and iPad tablet. Macs accounted for about  28 percent
of revenue  last quarter, while the iPhone was its top-selling
product, making up 40 percent of sales. Apple also revamped its
aluminum-clad MacBook Pro notebooks this year.  
 “This is the most significant form factor change for the
Mac Mini since it was introduced in January 2005,” said  Shaw Wu , an analyst at Kaufman Bros LP in San Francisco. He
recommends  buying  Apple shares and doesn’t own them. Wu said the
only disappointment is the higher price point even though the
features are more advanced.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, rose $5.41 to
$259.69 at 4 p.m. New York time in  Nasdaq Stock Market   trading .
The shares have gained 23 percent this year.
