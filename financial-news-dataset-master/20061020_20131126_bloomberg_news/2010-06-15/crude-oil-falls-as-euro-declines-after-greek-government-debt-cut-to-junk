             Crude oil rose in New York before a
report that may show growing U.S. demand for the fuel and as the
euro recovered against the dollar, boosting the appeal of
commodities.  
 U.S. crude  stockpiles  probably fell for a third week, a
Bloomberg survey showed. The Energy Department is scheduled to
release its weekly report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.
The euro rebounded to $1.2259 and the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index rose 0.3 percent.  
 “Oil is reacting to fluctuations in the euro and stronger
equities markets today,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at
VTB Capital in London. “Attention is gradually turning to
fundamentals, with the U.S. weekly inventories tomorrow.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose as much as 96 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $76.08 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $75.63 a barrel as of 12:55
p.m. London time.  
 Brent crude oil for July settlement was up 70 cents at
$75.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The July future expires today. The more active August contract
rose 44 cents to $76.10 a barrel.  
 European equities rose and the region’s currency recovered
losses against the dollar. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index
advanced 0.3 percent to 253.31 as of 12:57 p.m. London time,
after earlier falling as much as 0.7 percent. September futures
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent today.  
 U.S. Inventories  
 U.S. crude  stockpiles  probably fell 1.75 million barrels in
the seven days ended June 11 from 361.4 million the week before,
according to the median of eight analyst estimates before an
Energy Department report this week.  
 Supplies of crude oil declined 1.83 million barrels in the
week ended June 4, last week’s report showed. Imports increased
0.9 percent to 9.54 million barrels a day over the period.  
 Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 1 million barrels from 155
million, according to the survey. Gasoline  stockpiles  rose
625,000 barrels from 219 million, the survey said.  
 “Refineries are replenishing distillate stocks for the
next heating season on the one hand and are increasing gasoline
production in anticipation of rising gasoline demand on the
other,” said  Carsten Fritsch , a Commerzbank AG analyst in
Frankfurt. “There has been little sign of gasoline demand
picking up in the USA so far.”  
 The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute is
scheduled to release its supply report today.  
 Offshore oil workers in Norway may strike starting on June
17 if mediation fails, affecting Statoil ASA’s Gullfaks and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Draugen platforms.  
 Unions have called for a strike at the Shell-operated
Draugen platform, which has output of about 43,000 barrels of
oil a day, Statoil’s Gullfaks B and C platforms and at floating
offshore hotels at the Ekofisk, Valhall and Snorre fields.
