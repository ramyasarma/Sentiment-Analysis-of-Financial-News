             Nigeria’s inflation rate declined to
11 percent in May, the lowest since September, as weak consumer
spending weighed on prices, even as the government stepped up
expenditure.  
 Inflation slowed from 12.5 percent in April, the National
 Bureau of Statistics  in the capital, Abuja, said today in a
statement.  
 Consumers have curtailed spending after a debt crisis in
the banking industry dried up lending last year. A stable naira
has also helped keep inflation subdued, leaving it between 11.6
percent and 12.5 percent in every month since October. Increased
government spending may begin to push up inflation in the second
half of the year.  
 Lamido Sanusi, the governor of the central bank, said last
month that the inflation outlook remains “uncertain” because
of the expansionary fiscal policy and the injection of funds to
deal with toxic debt in the banking system. The Senate approved
a bill on May 5 to buy bad debts from commercial banks and
inject funds into the industry.  
 The naira has been stable, trading between 149 to the
dollar and 153 all year. It closed at 151.35 to the U.S.
currency on Friday.  
 Nigeria vies with Angola to be Africa’s top oil producer
and is the fifth-largest source of U.S. crude imports.
