             Malaysia’s ringgit slid for the
first time in five days as Moody’s Investors Service cut
Greece’s bonds to junk, spurring concern investors will shun
higher-yielding assets for the relative safety of the dollar.  
 The currency snapped its longest stretch of gains in more
than two months as the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional
shares fell. Moody’s yesterday cut Greece’s sovereign rating by
four levels to Ba1 from A3, citing “substantial” risks to
economic growth. Standard & Poor’s had cut the Mediterranean
nation’s rating to non-investment grade on April 27.  
 “There is a lot of pessimism priced into the market, and
the latest downgrade of Greece” has revived it, said  Sim Moh Siong , a Singapore-based currency strategist at Bank of
Singapore Ltd. “Overall, the tone is still cautiously
positive.”  
 The ringgit dropped 0.6 percent to 3.2670 per dollar as of
9:37 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 A report later today will show retail sales in Singapore,
Malaysia’s neighbor and its largest export market, increased 0.8
percent in April after shrinking 2.4 percent in the previous
month, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Singapore accounts for 14 percent of Malaysia’s
shipments.  
 Greece has cut spending, raised taxes and trimmed wages to
tackle its deficit, which swelled to 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product last year, more than four times the European
Union limit.
