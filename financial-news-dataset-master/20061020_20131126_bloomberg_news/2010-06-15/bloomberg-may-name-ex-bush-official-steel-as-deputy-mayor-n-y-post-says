             New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  may name former Treasury Department official Robert K.
Steel as deputy mayor for economic development, the New York
Post reported, citing an unidentified source.  
 Steel was hired as chief executive officer of Wachovia
Corp. in 2008 and engineered its sale to  Wells Fargo & Co.  later
that year after it almost collapsed. He would replace  Robert Lieber , who is joining an investment firm, the newspaper said.  
 Steel, 58, declined to comment when reached in Connecticut.
 Andrew Brent , a spokesman for the mayor, also declined to
comment.  
 A former head of equities and later vice chairman at
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Steel has 30 years of experience on
Wall Street and at the Treasury. Before taking the Wachovia
post, he served as undersecretary for domestic finance in the
Treasury Department under  Henry Paulson , the former CEO of
Goldman Sachs. Paulson held the post under former President
 George W. Bush .  
 A Durham, North Carolina, native, Steel attended Duke
University and has a master’s in business administration from
the University of Chicago.  
 The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.
