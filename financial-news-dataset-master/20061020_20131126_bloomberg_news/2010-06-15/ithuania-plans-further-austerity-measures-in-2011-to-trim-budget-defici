             Lithuania’s government plans to
introduce new austerity measures next year to save 1.3 billion
litai ($460 million) to 1.5 billion litai, Prime Minister
 Andrius Kubilius  said.  
 The savings will come partly from plans to increase the
retirement age, extend cuts in public employee wages that expire
next year and reduce paternity leave benefits, Kubilius said in
a press conference today in Vilnius. In addition, an economic
recovery is expected to reduce the deficit by about 2 billion
litai next year, Kubilius said.  
 The Baltic nation, which pushed through one of the European
Union’s toughest austerity packages last year, will have to
continue cuts through 2012 to help achieve its goal of adopting
the euro in 2014. The measures exacerbated last year’s
recession, when gross domestic product shrank 14.8 percent and
the deficit widened to 8.9 percent of  GDP .  
 The government plans to limit paid paternity leave to one
year, compared with the current two, and gradually raise the
retirement age to 65 starting in 2012, Kubilius said. The
current retirement age is 60 for women and 62 1/2 for men.
