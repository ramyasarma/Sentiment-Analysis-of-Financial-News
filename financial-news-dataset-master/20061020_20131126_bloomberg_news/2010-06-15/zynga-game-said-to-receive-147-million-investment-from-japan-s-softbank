             Zynga Game Network Inc., the biggest
provider of Facebook games, received a 13.5 billion yen ($147
million) investment from  Softbank Corp. , according to two people
familiar with the agreement.  
 Softbank and Zynga have discussed distributing and jointly
promoting games through Softbank’s mobile-phone service in Japan
and other countries, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the agreement isn’t public.  Dani Dudeck , a
spokeswoman for closely-held Zynga, and  Takeaki Nukii , a
spokesman for Softbank, declined to comment.  
 The agreement, reported earlier today by Nikkei English
News, builds on the $180 million Zynga raised from venture
capitalists in December and may help the San Francisco startup
expand in Asia.  
 Softbank  fell 0.4 percent to 2,346 yen at 9:24 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average dropped 0.3 percent.  
 Zynga expects revenue of more than $450 million this year,
two people who have been briefed on its financials said in April.
April. Most of its profits come from sales of virtual goods on
Facebook Inc.’s service, and the company has recently looked to
diversify beyond the social-networking site.
