             Cosan SA Industria & Comercio , the
world’s biggest sugar-cane processor, and 84 more Brazilian
ethanol makers this month will seek authorization to build a 3
billion-real ($1.7 billion) pipeline to ship fuel to a
southeastern port from producing areas in Sao Paulo state.  
 The  Uniduto Logistica SA  joint venture will request an
environmental license to build an ethanol pipeline spanning 600
kilometers (373 miles), more than the distance between New York
and Pittsburgh, Chief Executive Officer Sergio van Klaveren said
in an interview. It will transport the fuel to a port in
Guaruja, in Sao Paulo’s southeastern coast, from Serrana, in the
north of state.  
 Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter of sugar and ethanol
made from cane, has more than doubled output of the biofuel in
the past six years to 27.5 billion liters (7.2 billion gallons)
in 2009, according to industry group Unica. Mills in Sao Paulo
state produce about 60 percent of the country’s ethanol.  
 “The pipeline will solve most of our logistic
bottleneck,” Klaveren said by telephone from Rio de Janeiro
yesterday.  
 Uniduto, based in Sao Paulo, plans to start the pipeline’s
construction in the first quarter of next year and to begin
operations by 2013, when it may sell shares in Brazil, Klaveren
said. The Brazilian government’s BNDES development bank will
finance 70 percent of the project.  
 Cosan and Copersucar SA, a trading joint venture between
mills that processes almost a fifth of Brazil’s sugar cane
harvest, each own 30 percent of Uniduto. The pipeline will
transport as much as 70 percent of ethanol output from Brazil’s
Center South, the world’s biggest sugar-producing region.
