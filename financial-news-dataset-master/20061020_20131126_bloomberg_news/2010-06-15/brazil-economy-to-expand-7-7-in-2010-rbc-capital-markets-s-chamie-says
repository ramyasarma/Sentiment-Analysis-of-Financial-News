             RBC Capital Markets increased
Brazil’s economic growth outlook for 2010 to 7.7 percent from 6
percent after a “solid start” this year.  
 The nation’s statistic agency said June 8 that Latin
America’s largest economy grew 9 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the fastest annual rate since 1995, and 2.7
percent from the previous quarter, “giving 2010 a solid
start,” Nick Chamie, head of emerging-markets research at RBC,
said in an e-mailed report. RBC expects Brazil to grow 4.5
percent in 2011.
