             Tom Izzo  will remain the basketball
coach at Michigan State University after deciding against a move
to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit television station WDIV
reported, citing sources it didn’t identify.  
 Izzo, who guided Michigan State to 13 straight men’s
college basketball national tournaments, was the Cavaliers’
preferred choice to succeed  Mike Brown . Cleveland, which
finished with the best record in the National Basketball
Association for the second straight season, ended Brown’s five-
year stint as coach last month after a second-round playoff exit
against the Boston Celtics.  
 Izzo may announce his decision later today or tomorrow,
WDIV said.
