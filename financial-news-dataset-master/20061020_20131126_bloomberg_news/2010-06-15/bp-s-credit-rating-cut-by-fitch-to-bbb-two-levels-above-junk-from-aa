             BP Plc’s  credit  rating  was cut six
levels to two above junk by Fitch Ratings on concern over the
potential cost of cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and
meeting future liabilities.  
 BP’s long-term issuer default and senior unsecured ratings
were lowered to BBB from AA, Fitch said in a statement today.
That follows a reduction from AA+ on June 3.  
 President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers said this week
that  BP  should suspend  dividends  and set aside funds now for
legal claims against the company from the spill, the worst in
U.S. history. Fitch said it would be “surprised” if BP didn’t
suspend the quarterly payout until the full costs are known. The
cost of cleanup and liabilities may reach $40 billion, Standard
Chartered Plc. estimated last week.  
 “The recent claims by U.S. state and federal authorities
that BP escrow significant sums preemptively, ahead of any
agreed claims process, represent a material change in
approach,” Fitch said in a statement. BP has about $23 billion
of debt outstanding, Bloomberg data show.  
 BP fell 3.8 percent to 342 pence in London, the lowest
since April 1997, after earlier rising as much as 2 percent.  
 Borrowing Costs  
 BP’s cost of borrowing is greater now for the short term
than for longer periods, a signal lenders are concerned at the
possibility of incurring losses on their credits.  
 Investors demand more yield to compensate them for an
expected loss in the short term because a decline in the value
of a long-term investment can be spread out over a greater
period. The result is that the so-called yield curve inverts as
yields on short-term bonds rise.  
 The yield premium investors demand to hold BP’s $1.5
billion of 3.125 percent bonds due 2012 rather than similar-
maturity government debt jumped 114 basis points to 730 basis
points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 The spread on its $1 billion of 4.75 percent notes due 2019
increased 48 basis points to 378 basis points, according to
Trace.  
 BP five-year credit-default swaps surged 39 basis points to
476.5 after today’s ratings downgrade, according to CMA
DataVision. Contracts covering the company’s debt for one year
were at 579 basis points, according to CMA.  
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid yesterday requested that
BP set aside $20 billion in a fund to be administered by an
independent trustee to speed up the claims process for victims
of the spill.  
 Changed Outlook  
 Fitch changed the outlook on BP to “evolving” from
“negative.”  
 BP had $5 billion of cash available, $5.25 billion of bank
credit lines it hadn’t used and another $5.25 billion of stand-
by bank facilities, according to Fitch, which cited a June 4
investor call. Fitch said it expects BP’s lenders to allow the
company to use the credit lines if needed.  
 Moody’s Investors Service rates BP debt at Aa2, the third-
highest investment grade, and Standard & Poor’s has it at AA-,
seven grades above the highest non-investment ranking. S&P
downgraded BP by one level last week. Moody’s and S&P, both
based in New York, declined to comment.
