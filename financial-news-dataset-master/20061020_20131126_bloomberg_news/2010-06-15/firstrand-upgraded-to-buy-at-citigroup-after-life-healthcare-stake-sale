             FirstRand Ltd., South Africa’s
second-biggest bank, had its recommendation raised to “buy”
from “hold” at Citigroup Inc., which cited an after-tax profit
of 800 million rand the lender made from the sale of its stake
in Life Healthcare Group Holdings Ltd., a hospital owner.  
 The Life Healthcare transaction “illustrates the strength
of FirstRand’s private-equity franchise,” Johannesburg-based
analyst Henry Hall wrote in a note to clients dated today.
Citigroup increased its price estimate to 21.80 rand from 21.30
rand.
