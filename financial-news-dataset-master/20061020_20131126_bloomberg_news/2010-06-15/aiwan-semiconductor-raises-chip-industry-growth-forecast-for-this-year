             Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co ., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, raised
this year’s market forecast as the industry’s growing confidence
in a recovery leads to higher investment in production capacity.  
 Global chip-industry sales this year will increase almost
30 percent in 2010, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Morris Chang  said at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting at its
Hsinchu, Taiwan headquarters today. Chang in April forecast 22
percent growth.  
 The forecast echoes projections at the Semiconductor
Industry Association and research firm Gartner Inc., which
raised their growth estimates for the chip market this month.
Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest memory chipmaker,
said last month it will spend a record 11 trillion won ($9
billion) in 2010 to increase its capacity to make semiconductors.  
 “The global economic environment will continue to improve
into next year, at the same time fast-growing developing
economies are also driving semiconductor demand,” Chang said.  
 Taiwan Semiconductor  rose 1 percent to NT$61.70 at 12:33
p.m. in Taipei trading. The benchmark Taiex index climbed 1.2
percent.  
 The global chip market will rise an average of seven
percent annually from 2011 to 2016, Chang said today, higher
than an earlier forecast for four to six percent.  
 China Demand  
 Increased demand from China for electronics products could
add about $30 billion in sales to the global chip market over
the next five years, the Financial Times reported yesterday,
citing Chang.  
 Separately, Chang said recent wage increases in China such
as those at  Foxconn Technology Group  won’t undermine Taiwan
Semiconductor’s operations or costs. Taiwan Semiconductor’s
Shanghai factory is the company’s smallest.  
 “Their higher wages are still not as high as what we
already had, so it won’t have any impact,” he said.  
 A proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement between
Taiwan and China will have neither a positive or negative impact
on Taiwan Semiconductor, Chang said today.  
 The company, whose customers include Texas Instruments Inc.
and Qualcomm Inc., said in January it plans to spend $4.8
billion this year on equipment and forecast a record NT$100
billion ($3.1 billion) to NT$102 billion in revenue this quarter.
