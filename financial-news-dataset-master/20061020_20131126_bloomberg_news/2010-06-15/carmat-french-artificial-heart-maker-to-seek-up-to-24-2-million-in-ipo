             Carmat SAS , a French company that’s
developing an artificial heart, plans to raise as much as 19.8
million euros ($24.3 million) in an initial public offering to
fund studies on the device.  
 Carmat, based in Velizy-Villacoublay near Paris, aims to
sell 800,000 shares at 17.35 euros to 20.15 euros each, the
company said in a statement today. If an extension clause and an
over-allotment option are exercised, Carmat would sell an
additional 258,000 shares, bringing the proceeds to 19.8 million
euros assuming the stock is sold at 18.75 euros, the middle of
the range, the company said.  
 An estimated 17.1 million people died from cardiovascular
disease worldwide in 2004 and that number may rise to almost 24
million by 2030, according to the  World Health Organization .
Carmat is developing a device for people suffering from advanced
heart failure and who can’t find a human heart for a transplant,
given that the number of available organs is too low and
decreasing, according to Carmat’s website.  
 The IPO will allow the company, founded in 2008, to
complete pre-clinical trials on the artificial heart and start
testing the device on humans. The implantable organ will
resemble the human heart as much as possible, featuring the
right and left ventricles, the website said. A prototype
completed in 2008 weighed 900 grams (31.7 ounces), according to
Carmat’s website.  
 Heart Valve  
 European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. , a Carmat
shareholder, plans to buy as much as 5 million euros of stock in
the sale. The other shareholders are  Truffle Capital , a Paris-
based venture capital firm, and  Alain Carpentier , the company’s
scientific director and developer of the heart.  
 Carpentier is an emeritus professor at the  Pierre & Marie
Curie University  in Paris, where he founded and manages the
heart transplant and prosthesis laboratory. He developed the
Carpentier Edwards heart valve, marketed by  Edwards Lifesciences
Corp.  He obtained an initial patent filing on the artificial
heart in 1988, according to Carmat’s website.  
 The IPO price will be fixed July 7, with trading to begin
July 13 on NYSE-Euronext’s Alternext market, the statement said.  
 Dexia Securities France,  Nomura Code  and  Invest Securities 
are arranging the sale. A sale of 800,000 shares at the midpoint
of the range would value the entire company at 67.7 million
euros.
