             Crude oil was little changed after
rising yesterday on speculation economic growth in the U.S. will
boost fuel demand from the world’s largest energy consumer.  
 Oil traded near $75 a barrel before a report tomorrow that
may show U.S. industrial production increased in May for the
10th time in 11 months, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Crude  stockpiles  in the U.S. probably fell for a
third week as refiners ramped up motor fuel output for the
summer demand season, based on a separate poll of analysts.  
 “Oil is really a growth proxy commodity,” said  Mark Pervan , a senior commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne. “The U.S. refiners are showing
stronger demand. The numbers tomorrow should be supportive. This
time of year we normally see healthy declines in stock levels.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery was at $75.18 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 6
cents, at 1:22 p.m. in Singapore. The contract yesterday
increased $1.34, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $75.12. Futures
have gained 6.5 percent in the past year.  
 Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities probably
gained 0.9 percent in May from 0.8 percent in April, according
to the median estimate from 63 economists polled by Bloomberg
News before Federal Reserve data due for release tomorrow.
Capacity utilization should expand to 74.5 percent from 73.7
percent, the survey showed.  
 “If we meet or exceed expectations things should be
fine,” said  Mark Waggoner , president of Excel Futures Inc. in
Newport Beach, California. “Obviously if it’s below that will
hurt the stock market a bit and subsequently hurt oil. It’s
still following the stock market, absolutely.”  
 Crude Inventories  
 Brent crude oil for July settlement was at $75.32 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, up 12 cents, at
12:23 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday increased 85
cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $75.20.  
 The July future expires today. The more actively traded
August contract was at $75.65 a barrel, down 1 cent, at 1:10 p.m.
in Singapore.  
 U.S. crude  stockpiles  probably fell 1.75 million barrels in
the seven days ended June 11 from 361.4 million in the previous
week, according to the median estimate from eight analysts
before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  
 Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 1 million barrels from 154.8
million, the survey showed. Gasoline  stockpiles  probably rose
625,000 barrels after dropping for five weeks to 219 million,
the lowest level this year.  
 The euro yesterday gained as much as 1.5 percent against
the dollar after a report showed European industrial production
in April climbed the most since records started in 1991. The 16-
nation currency ended 0.9 percent higher at $1.2221 after
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating on Greek
government bonds to junk. The euro was at $1.2209 at 1:22 p.m.
Singapore time.  
 The dollar’s decline increases the appeal of commodities
for investors as a hedge against inflation.
