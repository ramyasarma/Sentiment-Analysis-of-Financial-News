             European Union and U.S. negotiators
reached a new agreement on transferring bank data to American
counter-terrorism investigators, seeking to overcome a veto by
EU lawmakers who want to protect privacy.  
 European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said the revised
accord, under which the EU would let the U.S. Treasury
Department view records from the  Swift  money-transfer system,
bolsters the protection of personal data. He urged approval by
the European Parliament, which rejected the previous deal in
February after saying its privacy provisions were inadequate.  
 “This draft is compatible with the respect of fundamental
rights,” Barroso told the 27-nation Parliament today in
Strasbourg, France. “It is subject to strict compliance with
safeguards on privacy and the protection of personal data.”  
 The assembly’s veto of the earlier accord deprived the U.S.
of its preferred tool for collecting European data under the
Terrorist Finance Tracking Program created after the Sept. 11
attacks. An EU-wide agreement spares the U.S. from having to
seek bank data on a country-by-country basis and makes the
transfers less politically controversial.  
 The rejection four months ago nullified a preliminary
agreement that was meant to be a precursor to a definitive deal.
The new text drafted by the  commission , the EU’s executive arm,
and the U.S. government would be the definitive accord, on which
the Parliament plans to vote in July.  
 Swift, with headquarters in Belgium and computer centers in
the Netherlands and Switzerland, is one of the main conduits for
the global financial system. The cooperative, formally called
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication,
relays money-transfer orders among 9,000 member banks and other
financial institutions in more than 200 countries.
