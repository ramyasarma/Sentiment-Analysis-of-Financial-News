             Westpac Banking Corp.’s New Zealand
unit may seek to sell covered bonds by December, public
relations manager Liz MacIntyre said in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg. “Westpac New Zealand is currently
working on developing a covered bond programme with the aim of
issuing pre Christmas,” she said. Westpac sees covered bonds as
a “good alternative funding source and supported the
development of such a market in New Zealand.”
