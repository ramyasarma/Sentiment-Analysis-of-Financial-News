             U.S. stocks rallied, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erasing its loss for the year, after
reports showed New York-area manufacturing expanded for an 11th
month and prices of imported goods declined.  
 Micron Technology Inc. and  Teradyne Inc.  rallied at least
8.6 percent after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. boosted
its market forecast.  Boeing Co.  rose 4.1 percent after
announcing plans to boost production of its best-selling 737
jet.  Caterpillar Inc.  gained 4 percent after reaffirming its
earnings guidance for 2010.  CBOE Holdings Inc.  rallied 12
percent on the first day of trading as a public company.  
 The  S&P 500  Index advanced 2.4 percent to 1,115.23 at 4
p.m. in New York, its highest level since May 18. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  surged 213.88 points, or 2.1 percent, to
10,404.77, the most since May 19.  
 “The data give support to a modest recovery and where the
market is today,” said  Tom Wirth , senior investment officer for
Chemung Canal Trust Co., which manages $1.6 billion in Elmira,
New York. “We’ve had a correction and the market is settling in
at a very reasonable valuation. I doubt we are going to have
much more of this corrective phase of the bull market.”  
 Today’s rally sent the  S&P 500  about 6.5 points above its
 average level  in the past 200 days, a move considered
significant by investors who base trading decisions on chart
patterns. The S&P 500 increased to near the 200-day mean on June
3 and May 27 before losing as much as 5 percent in the next two
days.  
 ‘Sustainability’ in Rally  
 “The 200-day moving average is rising and the direction of
the indicator shows there is some sustainability to this
rally,” said  Dan Wantrobski , the Philadelphia-based director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. “What has
happened in the last couple of weeks is that the safe-havens
became way too overbought and the risk-markets became oversold,
so now we’re seeing a mean-reversion trade.”  
 The S&P 500 tumbled as much as 14 percent from a 19-month
high on April 23 through June 7 as concern grew that Europe’s
debt crisis will derail the economic recovery and BP Plc’s
leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the worst oil spill
in U.S. history. The S&P 500 has rebounded 6.2 percent since
June 7 as concern over European budget deficits eased and
investors speculated growth in China and the U.S. will bolster
the global recovery.  
 Industrials Advance  
 All 57 stocks in  the S&P 500 Industrials Index  gained after
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index
increased to 19.6, in line with the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Prices of goods imported
into the U.S. fell 0.6 percent in May, led by the biggest drop
in petroleum costs since December 2008, Labor Department figures
showed.  
 Semiconductor stocks rallied after Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract maker of chips,
boosted this year’s market forecast.  Taiwan Semiconductor’s  U.S.
traded shares climbed 4.3 percent to $10.27.  Teradyne  rallied 11
percent to $11.77 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Micron,
the biggest U.S. producer of computer memory, increased 8.6
percent to $9.68. Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker,
rose 2.8 percent to $21.48.  
 Microsoft Corp. rose the most since October 2009, jumping
4.3 percent to $26.58 for the biggest gain in the Dow.
International Data Corp. reiterated its projection for 20
percent growth in global PC shipments in 2010 and said desktop
computer sales are recovering.  
 Dell Inc., the world’s third-largest personal-computer
maker, gained the most since April 2009, surging 7 percent to
$14 as  technology companies  gained the second-most of 10
industry groups in the S&P 500, climbing 2.9 percent
collectively.  
 Boeing Rallies  
 Boeing  increased 4.1 percent to $67.48 for the third-
biggest gain in the Dow. The world’s second-largest builder of
commercial jets plans to boost production of its best-selling
737 jet by an additional 3 percent, the second increase in as
many months as airlines recover from the recession and add to
the plane’s $138 billion order backlog.  
 UAL Corp.  increased 3.6 percent to $23.74. The parent
company of United Airlines said it expects second-quarter
consolidated passenger unit revenue to increase 26 percent to 27
percent from a year earlier, according a regulatory filing.  
 Caterpillar Inc.  rose 4 percent to $63.46. The world’s
largest maker of construction equipment reiterated its guidance
for the year at the Wells Fargo Securities Industrial
Conference.  Industrial companies  rallied 3 percent as a group in
the S&P 500.  
 Exxon, Chevron  
 Exxon Mobil Corp. jumped 1.9 percent to $62.51, while
Chevron Corp. gained 1.4 percent to $75.23. Energy companies
rose 2.7 percent as a group as crude oil for July delivery
jumped $1.82 to $76.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 CBOE  jumped 12 percent to $32.49 on the first day of
trading. The owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange
completed its transformation into a public company with an
initial public offering that snapped a two-week drought in
American IPOs.  
 Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer, fell the most in the S&P 500, sliding 6.1 percent to
$38.56 after reporting first-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  
 American Express Co. , the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, rose 4.3 percent to $41.59 for the second-biggest
gain in the Dow after reporting that overdue loans fell in May.  
 News Corp.  gained 9.5 percent to $14.37 for the second-
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The media company led by  Rupert Murdoch  said it plans to raise about $4 billion in debt to fund
its 7.8 billion-pound ($11.5 billion) offer for British Sky
Broadcasting. BSkyB has asked for the bid to be raised by at
least 14 percent.  BSkyB’s U.S.-traded shares  gained 17 percent
to $41.25.
