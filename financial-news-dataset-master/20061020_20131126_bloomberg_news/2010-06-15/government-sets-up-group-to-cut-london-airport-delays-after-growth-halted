             U.K. Transport Secretary Philip
Hammond set up a task force to improve the efficiency of air
travel to and from southeast England after his government vetoed
the expansion of London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
airports.  
 “We have been clear in our opposition to additional
runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, so the challenge we
face now is making them better within existing runway capacity
constraints,” Hammond said in an e-mailed statement. “This
group will look at how to secure the successful future of
aviation in the southeast and Heathrow’s hub status within the
constraints of the existing runways.”  
 The task force will include representatives of airlines,
passenger groups, environmental groups and industry bodies,
Hammond said.  
 “I have a clear vision for our airports which sees greater
reliability, shorter queues, less hassle and better services for
passengers,” Hammond said. “It is absolutely crucial that we
get this right as aviation is vital to our national economy.”
