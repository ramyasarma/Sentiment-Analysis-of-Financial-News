             The euro may appreciate to the
highest level in three weeks as investors close out bets for
declines in the shared currency, according to Barclays PLC.  
 The euro’s move today beyond its 21-day moving average of
$1.2227 could spur further gains to $1.2475, the highest since
May 24, according to  MacNeil Curry , a technical strategist at
Barclays in New York.  
 “This price action is being more driven by short covering
than new positions,” Curry said in a telephone interview.
“Markets are throwing out conflicting signals, which is
indicative of short selling.” A short is a bet the price of an
asset will decline.  
 The shared currency touched $1.1877 on June 7, the lowest
level in four years, as concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
may spread drove investors to seek safer assets. Its rally of as
much as 3.8 percent since then is a “corrective bounce,”
according to Curry, who forecasts the euro will weaken to
$1.1435 by the end of the year.  
 The  difference  in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those betting on a gain was near a record on June 8, according
to the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  
 Futures positions, when they reach an extreme, are
sometimes viewed as a contrarian indicator because traders often
seek to cut positions when momentum in a currency shifts.
