             England striker  Wayne Rooney 
apologized for his comments directed toward fans following his
team’s 0-0 draw with Algeria at the World Cup.  
 Rooney, 24, turned toward a television camera and
complained about the supporters who jeered the England team
during last night’s Group C game in Cape Town. He could then be
heard cursing as he walked away.  
 “I am as passionate about the England team as anyone,”
Rooney said in a  statement  today on the Football Association’s
website. “Last night, on reflection, I said things in the heat
of the moment that came out of frustration of both our
performances and the result. I apologize for any offense caused
by my actions at the end of the game.”  
 England has tied both of its games in South Africa and is
third in Group C, from which the top two advance the round of 16.
It closes group play June 23 against Slovenia in Port Elizabeth.
