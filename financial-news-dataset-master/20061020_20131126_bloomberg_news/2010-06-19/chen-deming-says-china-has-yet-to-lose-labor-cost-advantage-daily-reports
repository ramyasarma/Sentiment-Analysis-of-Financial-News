             China has yet to lose its labor cost
advantage in spite of rising wages in the Pearl River Delta 
region of the country, the official China Daily reported 
Commerce Minister Chen Deming as saying.  
 The impact of rising wage costs will be limited, he was 
quoted as saying yesterday at a training course for government 
officials from Mozambique. A small proportion of contracts may 
be transferred to countries with lower costs, he said.  
 To address rising costs, companies should climb the “value
ladder” in design and marketing, and considering moving to 
western regions of China or to nations with lower labor costs, 
he was quoted as saying.
