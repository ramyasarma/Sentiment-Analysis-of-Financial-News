             The People’s Bank of China today
said it will allow more yuan exchange rate flexibility and
reform of the exchange-rate mechanism as the nation’s economic
recovery has “cemented” after the global financial crisis.  
 The Beijing-based central bank said it will continue with
the existing trading band of the yuan. It made the announcement
on its website.
