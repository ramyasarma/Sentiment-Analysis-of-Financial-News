             India changed a rule to allow life
insurance companies to offer unit-lined plans, the Press
Information Bureau said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Unit-linked products are insurance plans sold by
life insurers which then invest the money collected into equity
and debt markets. The government has also set up a panel to
decide on the jurisdiction of hybrid financial products,
according to the statement.
