             China’s decision to allow a more
flexible yuan is a “small” step as the Chinese currency
remains “substantially” undervalued, the International
Monetary Fund’s No. 2 official said.  
 “It gives the sense that they are intending to reinstate
the policies that they were following before the crisis,” IMF
First Deputy Director  John Lipsky  said in a Bloomberg Television
interview in St. Petersburg today. “It’s just one small part of
the needed moves.”  
 China today said it will allow a more flexible yuan,
signaling an end to the currency’s 23-month-old peg to the
dollar a week before a Group of 20 summit. The decision to
“increase the renminbi’s exchange-rate flexibility” was made
because the economy has improved, the central bank said. It
added that there is no basis for “large-scale appreciation.”
The yuan’s 0.5 percent daily trading band will remain unaltered.  
 “It would be a mistake to view a single policy move, even
one that’s been as closely watched and broadly anticipated and
hoped for as this, as representing a solution and remedy on
itself,” Lipsky said.  
 It’s not clear how much the Chinese currency may
appreciate, he said, adding that the decision will help develop
domestic demand, rein in consumer-price growth in China and
support commodity prices.  
 “We are convinced that this would be a very helpful
contribution to the process of the global economic adjustment
and reform,” he said.
