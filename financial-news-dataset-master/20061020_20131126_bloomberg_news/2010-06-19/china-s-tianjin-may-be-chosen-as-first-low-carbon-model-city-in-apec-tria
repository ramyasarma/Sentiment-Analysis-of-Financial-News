             Asia-Pacific nations will establish
as many as 20 low-carbon model cities to test new technology
including smart grids and renewable-power generation as part of
efforts to reduce pollution and dependence on crude oil.  
 Tianjin, northeastern China, may be the first city picked
for the project, Japan’s trade minister,  Masayuki Naoshima , said
today after a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
energy ministers in the western Japanese town of Fukui. The
cities will be chosen within three years, he said.  
 The meeting comes as the BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico heightens concerns about environmental degradation and
global dependence on crude oil. APEC wants to spur the
development of low-carbon, non-oil energy sources in the region,
which accounts for 60 percent of world energy demand and where
pollution is forecast to rise the fastest.  
 APEC will also seek to cooperate on financing new nuclear
plants as the region adds reactors to meet rising power demand
without emitting more carbon dioxide or importing additional oil,
according to a joint statement released after the meeting today.  
 APEC will also evaluate the potential of unconventional
sources of natural gas, which include gas extracted from shale
rock and from coal seams, as demand grows for the cleaner-
burning fuel, it said.  
 The 21-member body will set up a task force to choose
cities for the Low-Carbon Model Town Project, and will consider
a proposal by China for Tianjin, Naoshima said.  
 Smart grids are advanced power transmission networks that
are able to efficiently integrate renewable energy such as  wind
and solar power .
