             Taiwanese free-range eggs were found
to have 5.7 times more dioxins than caged-chicken eggs,
researchers Hsu Jing-fan, Chen Chun and Liao Pao-chi wrote in
the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry.  
 Samples from six free-range and 12 caged-chicken eggs found
higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
dibenzofurans in the free-range eggs, which indicate different
levels of exposure to the dioxins, the researchers wrote,
according to an abstract of the article published on the Website
of the American Chemical Society.
