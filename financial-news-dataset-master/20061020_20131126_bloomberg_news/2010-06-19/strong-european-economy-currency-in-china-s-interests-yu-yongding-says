             A strong European economy and a
strong euro are in China’s interests, economist Yu Yongding, a
former adviser to the People’s Bank of China, wrote in an
analysis posted on the China Finance 40 Forum today.  
 The decline in the euro is temporary, he wrote on the
website of the non-profit, non-government financial research
institute.  
 The U.S. is still the biggest threat to world financial
stability, Yu wrote. Yu was previously a member of the Chinese
central bank’s monetary policy committee.
