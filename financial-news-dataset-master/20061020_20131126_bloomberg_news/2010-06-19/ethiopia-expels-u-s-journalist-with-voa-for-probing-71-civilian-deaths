             Ethiopia expelled an American
journalist working for the U.S.-owned Voice of America radio
service after detaining her for reporting claims by a rebel
group that government forces killed 71 civilians.  
 Heather Murdock said today that she was detained by
Ethiopian security June 12 while investigating reports by the
separatist Ogaden National Liberation Front of killings last
week near the eastern Ethiopian town of Babile, Murdock said in
an e-mail today. She was released two days later and expelled
from the country on June 17.  
 Bereket Simon, Ethiopia’s communication affairs minister,
confirmed the expulsion, saying in a phone interview Murdock
“was searching for ONLF people.”  
 Murdock said from Cairo she “didn’t know talking to people
was a crime in Ethiopia.”  
 Ethiopia’s foreign ministry accused VOA of attempting to
undermine the country’s May 23 elections and of “rooting for
violence,” according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 Ethiopia, where virtually all domestic radio broadcasters
are controlled by the government or Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi ’s ruling party, has jammed VOA broadcasts to Ethiopia
since March. Last year, it jailed an Ethiopian reporter for VOA
for two weeks on tax charges before releasing him.
