             OAO Gazprom will “aggressively”
seek projects in Africa to catch up with international rivals
there, said Boris Ivanov, head of the Russian company’s
international exploration and production .  
 Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural-gas producer, is
looking at oil and gas projects in Nigeria and plans to work on
the planned trans-Saharan pipeline to Algeria, Ivanov said today
at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Gazprom and
Nigeria agreed last year to set up a venture called NiGaz Energy
Co. Ltd.
