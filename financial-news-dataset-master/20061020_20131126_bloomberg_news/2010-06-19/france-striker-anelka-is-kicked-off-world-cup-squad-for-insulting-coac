             France striker  Nicolas Anelka  was
sent home from the World Cup after he insulted coach  Raymond Domenech  during the team’s 2-0 loss to Mexico.  
 Anelka, who has started both of France’s games in South
Africa, argued with Domenech at halftime, French sports
newspaper L’Equipe reported. He later refused to say sorry when
asked to by French Football Federation president  Jean-Pierre Escalettes .  
 “Words spoken by Nicolas Anelka to the national coach,
Raymond Domenech, are completely unacceptable to the FFF, French
football and the values they defend,” the federation said in
 statement . “With the refusal of the player to publicly
apologize, it was decided in full agreement with the coach and
members of the delegation to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the
squad.”  
 France, the 1998 champion and runner-up four years ago, is
in third place in Group A and its chances of advancing to the
round of 16 are out of its hands following a 0-0 draw with
Uruguay and the loss to Mexico.  
 If Mexico and Uruguay draw in their final group match on
June 22, France will be eliminated.  
 France captain  Patrice Evra  said at a televised news
conference that Anelka’s expulsion was “a hard blow” for the
team to take.  
 “We put ourselves in a catastrophic situation with the
loss, and now we have lost a player,” Evra said. “I know the
guy, and he’s a sweet guy. He’s hurt by what’s happened. You
forget that we are human. These things happen in dressing rooms.
Insults are unacceptable but things get said in dressing
rooms.”
