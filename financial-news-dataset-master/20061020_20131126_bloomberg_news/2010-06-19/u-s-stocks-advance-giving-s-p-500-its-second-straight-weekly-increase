             U.S. stocks rose, capping the
market’s biggest two-week rally since November, after New York-
area manufacturing expanded and Europe’s efforts to contain its
debt crisis bolstered confidence in the global economy.  
 Caterpillar Inc.  and United Technologies Corp. each
advanced at least 4.4 percent this week.  Apple Inc.  jumped 8.1
percent on optimism over the new version of its iPhone.  Intel
Corp.  climbed 3.7 percent to pace gains in semiconductor stocks
after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s
largest contract maker of chips, boosted its market forecast.  
 The  S&P 500  rose 2.4 percent over the past five days to
1,117.51, adding to the previous week’s 2.5 percent advance. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 239.57 points, or 2.4
percent, to 10,450.64. Both measures erased losses for the year.  
 “The recovery is on track,” said  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors, which manages about $400 billion. “Investors are now
thinking that the global pressures will not be sufficient to
derail the economic rebound. The stock market was significantly
undervalued. The trend is higher.”  
 The S&P 500, the  U.S. equity benchmark , fell as much as 14
percent from a 19-month high in April on concern that widening
budget deficits in Europe would curtail global growth. The
decline drove the  S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio  to about
15.2 earlier this month, the cheapest valuation since June 2009.
The index rebounded 6.4 percent from a seven-month low on June 7
amid speculation the economic rebound will continue.  
 ‘Relief Rally’  
 Gains in U.S. equities came as the euro rallied 2.3 percent
to almost $1.24, its biggest weekly advance against the dollar
in more than a year. Increased demand at a Spanish bond sale and
an agreement by European Union leaders to disclose how banks
perform on stress tests bolstered confidence that European debt
crisis is contained  
 “You’ve got a relief rally,” said  Kevin Rendino , who
manages about $11 billion in Plainsboro, New Jersey, for
 BlackRock Inc. , the world’s largest asset manager. “Valuations
are incredibly attractive, companies are doing well. We applied
the right medicine. The economy continues to recover.”  
 All but four of 57 stocks in the  S&P 500 Industrials Index 
gained after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general
economic index increased to 19.6, an 11th-straight month of
growth.  
 The report helped trigger a 2.4 percent rally on June 15,
the biggest gain of the week, which took the S&P 500 above its
200-day moving average for the first time in more than a month.
The index remained above the trend line for the rest of the
week, a bullish sign to investors who make trading decisions
based on chart patterns.  
 Caterpillar, Boeing  
 Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of bulldozers,
surged 9.3 percent to $65.85, leading the gains in the Dow
average.  United Technologies , the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet
engines and Otis elevators, rose 4.5 percent to $69.18.  
 Boeing Co.  gained 4 percent to $67.96. The maker of world’s
most widely flown jetliner plans to boost production of its
best-selling 737 jet by an additional 3 percent, the second
increase in as many months as airlines recover from the
recession and add to the plane’s $138 billion order backlog.  
 Semiconductor companies had the biggest gain in the S&P 500
among 24 industries, climbing 4.8 percent as a group.  
 Chipmaker Demand  
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said global sales will
increase almost 30 percent in 2010, up from its April forecast
of 22 percent growth.  Intel , the world’s largest chipmaker,
advanced 3.7 percent to $21.40. Teradyne Inc. rose 12 percent to
$11.80.  Micron Technology Inc.  jumped 12 percent to $10.  
 Apple  rallied 8.1 percent to $274.07. Piper Jaffray Cos.
analyst  Gene Munster  raised his 2010 earnings estimate to $13.07
a share from $12.90, citing sales of the company’s new iPhone.
He also boosted his forecasts for iPhone sales in the quarters
ending in June and September to 9.5 million each. His previous
estimates were for sales of 8.5 million and 9 million,
respectively. Apple’s share-price estimate was also increased to
$348 from $330 at Piper Jaffray.  
 “Technology companies have great business models and they
generate a lot of cash,” said  Michael Levine , a money manager
at New York-based OppenheimerFunds Inc., which oversees about
$165 billion. “The replacement cycle in conjunction with better
corporate profits will drive higher spending.”  
 M&A Talks  
 M&T Bank Corp.  rose the most in the S&P 500, jumping 16
percent to $90.71, on takeover speculation. Banco Santander SA
said it has made no decision on whether to combine its business
with of the U.S. bank.  Matias Inciarte , the Spanish lender’s
third vice-chairman, said “it’s been said” that there have
been conversations between the two banks.  
 GameStop Corp.  and  Best Buy Co.  had the two biggest
declines in the S&P 500, each dropping at least 8.1 percent.
Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer,
reported first-quarter profit excluding some items of 36 cents a
share, missing the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey by 28 percent. The company said it plans to let customers
trade in their used video games at more than 1,000 U.S. stores
to grab sales from competitors.  
 A  gauge of 12 homebuilders  in S&P indexes declined 3.1
percent.  Toll Brothers Inc. , the largest U.S. luxury
homebuilder, said deposits have been running 20 percent behind
the year-earlier period in the past three weeks as the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill and European debt crisis hurt buyer confidence.  
 Toll Brothers fell 4.7 percent to $17.95, a third-straight
weekly loss. KB Home declined 5.2 percent to $12.30. D.R. Horton
Inc. slid 4.5 percent to $10.75.  
 FedEx Slips  
 FedEx Corp.  dropped 2.4 percent to $78.70. The world’s
largest air-cargo carrier forecast annual profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates, citing rising health-care and pension costs
in a “moderate” economic recovery.  
 Quarterly reports scheduled for next week include  Adobe
Systems Inc. , the world’s biggest maker of graphic-design
programs, and  Oracle Corp. , the world’s second-largest software
maker. Walgreen Co., Carnival Corp., Nike Inc., Bed Bath &
Beyond Inc.,  Lennar Corp. , ConAgra Foods Inc. and H&R Block Inc.
will also report.  
 Sales of previously-owned homes rose in May while those of
new houses fell, reflecting the timing of a tax credit, and a
rise in business spending signaled factories are leading the
rebound, economists said before reports next week.
