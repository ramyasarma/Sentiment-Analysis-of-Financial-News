             Phil Hughes  became the American
League’s second 10-game winner, pitching the New York Yankees
to a 5-3 victory that ended the crosstown rival Mets’ eight-
game winning streak.  
 Mark Teixeira  and  Curtis Granderson  hit two-run home runs
as the Yankees overcame a pair of homers by  Jose Reyes , who
drove in all three Mets runs in the Major League Baseball game
at Yankee Stadium.  
 All the Yankees’ runs came off Mets starter  Mike Pelfrey 
(9-2), who also was seeking his 10th win of the season. Pelfrey
was the winner last month in the only loss for Hughes (10-1),
who joined Tampa Bay’s  David Price  as the league’s 10-game
winners.  
 Mariano Rivera  pitched the ninth for the Yankees for his
16th save of the season.  
 The Yankees had been held to a total of four runs in their
previous three games -- all defeats -- including a 4-0 loss to
the Mets last night. The teams meet again tomorrow, with  CC Sabathia  pitching for the Yankees against the Mets’  Johan Santana  in a duel of former Cy Young Award winners.  
 Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter , who bruised his right heel
last night in the opening game of the weekend series, skipped
today’s game.
