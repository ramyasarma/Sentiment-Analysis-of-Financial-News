             China’s President Hu Jinato 
identified the country’s widening wealth gap and the 
development of the Tibet and Xinjiang regions as top 
priorities for the central government, the South China Morning 
Post reported, citing unidentified officials.   
 Hu sees the three issues as potential triggers of social 
unrest, the newspaper said, citing officials who attended 
internal meetings with the President. Hu chaired two Politburo 
meetings, one on Tibet and Xinjiang, earlier this year, and 
plans to convene a meeting to discuss how to address the 
widening income gap later in the year, the Hong Kong-based 
newspaper said.
