             Japan should reduce government
spending including salaries of public employees before raising
the sales tax, Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said today.  
 “We need to cut costs for government employees and
parliament first,” Noda said today in a TV Tokyo Corp.’s
program. “We must explain to the public that we need
sufficient funds to ensure sustainable social security.”  
 Japan’s national sales tax will be raised to strengthen
the finances of the world’s second-largest economy, the ruling
Democratic Party signaled in its midterm election manifesto.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on June 17 that he will consider
a proposal by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party to
double tax to 10 percent.  
 “We have to rebuild government finance” by stopping
waste and spending money in growth areas, Noda said. “It’s
natural to go beyond parties to talk about this.”  
 The government will discuss changes in corporate, income
and sales taxes after the election next month, Noda said. The
government also should hold elections to earn the public’s
confidence whenever it raises or cuts taxes, he said.  
 Japan’s public  debt , the world’s largest, will rise even
if new government bond sales stay at the current fiscal year’s
cap of 44 trillion yen ($485 billion), Kan said on June 9. His
government is to compile a fiscal restructuring plan by the end
of the month.
