             “Toy Story 3” had $41 million in
sales yesterday, putting the film from  Walt Disney Co. ’s Pixar
on track this weekend to have a $100 million-plus debut, the
best-ever for the studio.  
 It would be the third film this year to open at $100
million or more, joining Paramount’s “Iron Man 2” ($128.1
million) and Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland” ($116.1 million),
box-office tracker  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in a
statement. In addition, it would be Pixar’s 11th debut at No. 1.  
 Yesterday’s sales make a $100 million opening “a foregone
conclusion,” said  Paul Dergarabedian , president of
Hollywood.com’s box-office tracking unit, in a statement.  
 “The Incredibles” is Pixar’s current top-grossing debut
film with $70.5 million in 2004, Hollywood.com said.  
 “Toy Story 3” is the first installment of the franchise
in 3-D. The film, featuring the voices of  Tom Hanks  as Woody and
 Tim Allen  as Buzz Lightyear, follows the toys’ attempt to
reunite with their owner, Andy, who is leaving for college.  
 Movie studios are turning to 3-D films to bolster
attendance and ticket sales following the record box-office
success of “Avatar,”  James Cameron ’s 3-D epic which has had
sales of more than $706 million in the U.S. and Canada. Cinemas
on average charge about $3 more per ticket for a 3-D film.  
 Imax Corp. 3-D showings had receipts of about $3 million
yesterday, the best animated opening day for the giant-screen
company, Hollywood.com said.
