             Noble Group, in which China’s 
sovereign wealth fund is a shareholder, bought a 5.1 percent 
stake in USEC Inc., the only American-owned provider of 
enriched uranium for use in civilian nuclear reactors, the New 
York Times reported, citing a filing to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.  
 Noble, which paid $30.2 million for the stake, wants to 
become USEC’s partner in marketing uranium enrichment for 
reactors in Asia, particularly China, Richard Elman, Noble’s 
founder and executive chairman, told the newspaper. USEC has 
American regulatory clearance to sell enriched uranium to 
mainland China, the report said.   
 Elman said he saw the investment in USEC as a commercial 
transaction and hadn’t told anyone in the Chinese government 
about the purchase, the New York Times said.    
 Noble began buying shares in USEC after Toshiba Corp. and 
Babcock & Wilcox announced they would buy $200 million of the 
American company’s convertible preferred stock, Elman told the 
newspaper.
