             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Global Economist Jim O’Neill said China’s currency, the yuan,
will appreciate 1 percent when markets open June 21, after
China’s leaders decided to allow a more flexible currency.  
 “Markets are going to like” China’s decision, which shows
the nation’s leaders “are increasingly confident,” O’Neill
said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television in St.
Petersburg, Russia.  
 O’Neill said he is maintaining his forecast that the yuan
will appreciate 5 percent by the end of the year and called the
currency “close to fair value.”
