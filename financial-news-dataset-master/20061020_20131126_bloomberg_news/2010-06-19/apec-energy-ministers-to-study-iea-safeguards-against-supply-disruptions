             Asia-Pacific countries will study
safeguards used by International Energy Agency members to
protect against energy supply disruptions and oil price swings.  
 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation energy ministers meeting
in central Japan agreed to participate in a one-week session
organized by the IEA this fall, Mitsuo Matsumoto, a director for
natural resources at Japan’s trade ministry, told reporters
today in Fukui city.  
 The IEA requires its  28 members  to stockpile enough crude
oil to last 90 days and release the fuel when emergencies
disrupt supplies and drive up prices. If a similar mechanism
were adopted by APEC, whose 21 members account for 60 percent of
the world’s energy demand, major energy consumers like China
would need to store millions of barrels of oil.  
 “We need to be better prepared to cooperate in the event
of an emergency,” IEA chief  Nobuo Tanaka  said in an interview
yesterday before the meeting.  
 APEC nations’ dependence on imported oil will  rise  to about
45 percent by 2030, compared with 34 percent in 2005, according
to the Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre. Of the APEC nations,
Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the U.S. are
also IEA member countries.  
 The IEA plans to hold its first meeting with both APEC and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations early next year, and
will discuss measures to deal with supply emergencies, Tanaka
said.  
 When Hurricane Katrina caused an oil shortage in the U.S.
and boosted oil price in September 2005, the IEA coordinated its
members to release more than 60 million barrels of oil and fuel
reserves.
