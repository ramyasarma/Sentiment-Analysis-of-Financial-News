             Macau’s casino revenue will increase
more than 30 percent in the second half this year as growth in
the world’s biggest gaming hub is being sustained,  Las Vegas
Sands Corp.  Chairman  Sheldon Adelson  said.  
 The increase will benefit all six casino operators in the
special administrative region of China, Adelson told reporters
today in Hong Kong after a shareholders meeting of Las Vegas
Sands unit  Sands China Ltd.  The projected growth follows a year-
to-date increase of more than 60 percent, he said.  
 Sands China last month secured $1.75 billion of financing
from lenders including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG as
the unit seeks to complete its new casino hotel complex in
Macau. Construction at the project in the Cotai area was halted
in 2008 as credit markets froze and revenue growth slowed.  
 The unit, the second-biggest casino operator in Macau, is
on target to complete the project by the third quarter of 2011,
Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jacobs  said today. The expansion
will include two casinos, 800,000 square feet of retail area and
800,000 square feet of meeting space, he said last month.  
 The $4 billion project, occupying two sites opposite Sands
China’s Venetian Macao on the Cotai Strip in the island of
Coloane, will add 6,000 rooms to the 3,600 the casino operator
has in the city.
