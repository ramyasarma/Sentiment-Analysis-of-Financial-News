             Manute Bol, a 7-foot-6 Sudanese
center who played 10 seasons in the National Basketball
Association from 1985-95, died this morning at a hospital
in Virginia. He was 47.  
 Bol was hospitalized in May after returning from Sudan
and was being treated for severe kidney trouble and a
painful skin condition, the Associated Press reported.  
 “Sudan and the world have lost a hero and an example
for all of us,” said Tom Prichard, executive director of
 Sudan Sunrise , the humanitarian group that was founded by
Bol after his NBA playing career.  
 Bol entered the NBA in 1985 as a second-round draft
pick of the Washington Bullets and led the league with 397
blocked shots as a rookie. He had 2,086 blocked shots in
his career with Washington, the Golden State Warriors,
Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat, averaging 2.6 points,
4.2 rebounds and 3.3 blocks. After retiring, he helped
raise money for people in Sudan through his foundation and
with publicity stunts as a hockey player, boxer and jockey.  
 ‘He was a person who was continually giving of himself
through his generosity and humanitarian efforts in order to
make the world around him a much better place,” 76ers
President  Ed Stefanski  said in a statement. “He will
always be remembered.”
