             The  Dalai Lama , Tibet’s exiled
spiritual leader, said he has no plan to request official talks
that would “inconvenience” Japan’s government and that his
lecture tour in the country is “non-political.”  
 The Dalai Lama, 74, arrived in Japan yesterday to lecture
on Buddhism at a temple in central Japan’s Nagano prefecture,
and in Yokohama. He spoke to reporters today at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Japan in Tokyo.  
 Overseas receptions of the Tibetan religious leader have
angered China’s government, which regards him as a separatist
since he fled to India in 1959. China objected to the Dalai
Lama’s meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in February and
canceled a China-European Union summit after French President
Nicolas Sarkozy met with him in 2008.  
 “This is a non-political visit, so I have nothing to ask
or discuss with the government,” the Dalai Lama said today.
“I don’t want to create any inconvenience to anybody.”  
 China opposes outside pressure on how the country runs
Tibet, which was brought under its rule in 1950.
