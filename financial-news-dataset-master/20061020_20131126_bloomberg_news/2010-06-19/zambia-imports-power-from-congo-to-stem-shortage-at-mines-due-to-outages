             Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper
producer, imported as many as 50 megawatts of electricity from
the Democratic Republic of Congo to supply mines following a
power outage yesterday, Copperbelt Energy Corp. said.  
 CEC, which distributes power in the southern African
nation, also had to switch on its six emergency turbines,
Managing Director  Neil Croucher  said today in an interview from
Kitwe, north of the capital, Lusaka.  
 “We were importing between 30 megawatts and 50 megawatts
of power from Congo and we had to switch on our emergency
turbines,” Croucher said by phone.
