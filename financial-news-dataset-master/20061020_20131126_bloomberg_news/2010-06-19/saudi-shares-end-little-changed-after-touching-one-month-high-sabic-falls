             Saudi Arabian stocks declined,
erasing an earlier gain to a one-month high, even as some
investors expect petrochemical companies and banks to post
encouraging second-quarter results.  
 The  Saudi Tadawul All Share Index  closed less than 0.1
percent lower at 6,345.67 in Riyadh.  
 “No doubt there was intraday volatility which had been
observed before and some investors preferred to take some
profits out,” said  John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque
Saudi Fransi in Riyadh. “The market is still looking forward
with optimism to the second-quarter results, especially for
petrochemicals, as oil prices have been settling above $75 a
barrel.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery gained 39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $77.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange yesterday. Prices have risen 8.1 percent in the past
year. They increased 4.6 percent this week, the biggest weekly
gain in three.  
 “Equities globally have fared well over the past few days,
which added to the feel-good factor for Saudi stocks over the
past two days,” Sfakianakis said.  
 U.S., European and developing-nation stocks rose yesterday
amid speculation Europe’s efforts to contain its debt crisis are
succeeding.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced for a second week
for the biggest back-to-back weekly gain since November, rising
0.1 percent to 1,117.51.  
 European, Emerging Markets  
 The  Stoxx Europe Index  gained 0.2 percent to 255.5, the
highest closing level since May 13 and the longest streak of
weekly gains since April.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-
nation equity markets, has gained 11 percent since this year’s
low on May 25, as concern eased that the global economic
recovery will falter.  
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, fell 0.5 percent to 91.75 riyals.  Banque
Saudi Fransi  retreated 2 percent, the most in two weeks, to 45
riyals.  
 Yansab National Petrochemicals Co. surged 4.6 percent to 43
riyals, the highest since May 18.  Riyad Bank , the third-largest
lender in the kingdom, rose 2.5 percent to 28.9 riyals, the
highest in a month.  
 Zamil Industrial Investment Co.  jumped 3.6 percent, the
most in three weeks, to 43.5 riyals. The company, along with
French water operator Saur SA, won a 173 million-riyal ($46.1
million) contract to operate the water and sewerage networks in
Mecca and Taif for five years.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Arab Gulf index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
