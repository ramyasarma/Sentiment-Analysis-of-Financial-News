             England beat the Wallabies 21-20 in
Sydney to secure its first victory in Australia since the 2003
Rugby World Cup final.  
 Jonny Wilkinson, who kicked the winning drop goal in the
final seven years ago, booted a late penalty to seal the win
after coming on as a replacement. Scrum-half Ben Youngs and wing
Chris Ashton got first-half tries, while Toby Flood added two
penalties and a coversion.  
 Australia inside center Matt Giteau scored all the points
for the Wallabies, who won last week’s opening Test in Perth
27-17.  
 It was England’s first win over a Tri-Nations team since
beating Australia at the 2007 World Cup and only its second away
victory in two years under manager Martin Johnson.
