             Umpqua Holdings Corp., owner of
Umpqua Bank in Oregon, bought its third failed lender this year,
agreeing to acquire Nevada Security Bank.  
 The bank in Reno, Nevada, was seized yesterday by state
regulators, according to a  statement  posted on the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. website.  Umpqua , based in Portland,
Oregon, said it will expand into Nevada with the purchase, which
boosts its number of branches to 181.  
 FDIC Chairman  Sheila Bair  said yesterday in a speech that
the U.S. needs new rules for loan origination, securitization
and servicing as banks continue to fail. She cited a “lack of
market discipline” that resulted in more than $2.1 trillion of
securities issued between 2004 and 2006 that were backed by
subprime mortgages or home loans made to borrowers not required
to document their income.  
 “The financial crisis was triggered by a reckless
departure from tried and true, common-sense loan underwriting
practices,” Bair said in  prepared remarks  at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in Philadelphia. “The FDIC is in
the midst of cleaning up the damage.”  
 Nevada Security Bank, with five branches, had $480.3
million in assets and $479.8 million in deposits, the FDIC said.
The FDIC and  Umpqua  will share any losses on $368.2 million of
the assets. The agency said the transaction will probably drain
$80.9 million from its deposit-insurance fund.  
 Umpqua acquired  Rainier Pacific Bank of Tacoma, Washington,
and Seattle-based Evergreen Bank earlier this year. In 2009, it
purchased the failed Bank of Clark County in Vancouver,
Washington.  
 Problem Lenders  
 The FDIC’s list of “problem” lenders is the longest in 17
years. Bair has said the confidential list rose to 775 banks
with $431 billion in assets in the first quarter. That’s an
increase from 702 banks with $402.8 billion in assets at the end
of the fourth quarter.  
 Umpqua rose  21 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $12.56 yesterday
in regular Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has climbed about 50
percent in the past year, compared with the 37 percent gain of
the 24-company  KBW Bank Index .
