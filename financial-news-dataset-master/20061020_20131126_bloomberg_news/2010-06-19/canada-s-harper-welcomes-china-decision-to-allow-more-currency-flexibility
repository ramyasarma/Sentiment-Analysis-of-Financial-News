             Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper today said he welcomed China’s announcement that it will
allow more flexibility in its currency, calling it “an
important step forward.”  
 In an e-mailed statement, Harper said that full
implementation of the increased flexibility would “contribute
to strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.” Harper also
said he is looking forward to “additional steps by G-20
countries at the Toronto summit to improve the economic
prospects of all of our citizens.”  
 Harper will host a meeting of leaders from the Group of 20
nations June 26-27 in Toronto.
