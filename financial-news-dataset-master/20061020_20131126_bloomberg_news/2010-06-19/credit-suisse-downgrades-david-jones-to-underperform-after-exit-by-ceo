             Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded
David Jones Ltd. to “underperform” from “outperform” and
reduced the target price to A$4.50 from A$5.30 after the
unexpected departure of Chief Executive Officer Mark McInnes.
Credit Suisse analyst Grant Saligari said reputational risk and
team instability were reasons for the downgrade.
