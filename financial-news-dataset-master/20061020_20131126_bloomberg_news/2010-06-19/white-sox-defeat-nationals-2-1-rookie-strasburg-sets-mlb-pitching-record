             Alex Rios  drove in a run in the
11th inning to give the Chicago White Sox a 2-1 win over
Washington as Nationals rookie  Stephen Strasburg  set a Major
League Baseball pitching record.  
 President  Barack Obama , wearing a White Sox cap, attended
the game with his daughters at Nationals Park to see Chicago
(32-34) win its fourth straight contest.  
 Strasburg struck out 10 in seven innings for a record 32
strikeouts in his first three major league appearances. The 21-
year-old right-hander surpassed Houston Astros J.R. Richard,
who retired 29 in his first three outings in 1971.  
 “That wasn’t a goal of mine” Strasburg said in a
televised interview. “My goal is to help the team win. It’s
all about wins and losses at this level.”  
 Strasburg left the game with the Nationals tied at 1-1. He
threw 59 strikes in 87 pitches and surrendered four hits and
one run without allowing a walk.  
 “I definitely wanted to finish the game, but there’s a
bigger picture,” Strasburg said. “The bullpen came out and
kept us within scoring distance.”  
 Rios grounded out to first to score  Juan Pierre  in the
first inning, while the Nationals’  Adam Dunn  tied the game in
the seventh, driving in  Ryan Zimmerman  on a double to center.  
 Gavin Floyd  pitched eight innings for the White Sox,
giving up four hits and one run and striking out five. J.J.
Putz (2-2) pitched one inning for the win and  Bobby Jenks  got
his 14th save.  
 Drew Storen (2-1) took the loss for the Nationals,
pitching two innings and allowing two hits, one run and two
walks.
