             Asian  stocks  rose this week, driving
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index up the most since December, as U.S.
economic reports eased concern that deficits in Europe will slow
a global recovery, and brokerages boosted investment ratings.  
 Samsung Electronics Co. , Asia’s biggest semiconductor maker,
gained 3.1 percent in Seoul this week on the outlook for chip
demand. Nissan Motor Co. jumped 6.2 percent in Tokyo after
Citigroup Inc. reiterated its “buy” rating on the carmaker.
Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore oil producer, rose 4.7
percent in Hong Kong as crude oil exceeded $75 a barrel and
analysts recommended the stock.  Nintendo Co.  soared 16 percent
in Osaka, Japan, after introducing a new video-game player.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 3.3 percent this week, the
most since the period ended Dec. 4. It has lost 3.6 percent this
year on concern Greece and other European countries will
struggle to curb their budget deficits and repay debt.  
 “There was a lot of pessimism about what’s happening in
Europe that took the market down,” said  Tim Leung , who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“It’s rebounding from that pessimism.”  
 Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 3 percent this week,
South Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 2.2 percent, Hong Kong’s  Hang
Seng Index  gained 2.1 percent, and Taiwan’s  Taiex index 
increased 2.7 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index declined
2.2 percent in a two-day week shortened by holidays.  
 Chip Shares Advance  
 Samsung Electronics, which receives about 44 percent of its
sales from the Americas and Europe, gained 3.1 percent to
822,000 won this week in Seoul. Tokyo Electron Ltd., the world’s
second-biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, increased 2.3
percent to 5,690 yen in Tokyo. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest maker of custom chips,
increased 3.6 percent to NT62.7 in Taipei.  
 Global sales in the chip industry will increase almost 30
percent this year, compared with an April forecast of 22 percent,
Morris Chang, chairman and chief executive officer of TSMC, said
this week.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has slumped 10 percent from its
high this year on April 15 as swelling budget deficits prompted
Standard & Poor’s to cut ratings of Greece, Spain and Portugal.
The retreat has driven down the average price of shares in the
gauge to about 14.8 times  estimated earnings . The ratio sank to
13.8 times on May 18, the lowest level since December 2008.  
 U.S. Boost  
 Stocks rebounded this week, with the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index  advancing every day . The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment for June
advanced to the highest level since January 2008, and the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its general economic index
of manufacturing rose in June for an 11th consecutive month.  
 “U.S. economic data remain resilient, and economies
continue to improve globally,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.,
which oversees more than $65 billion.  
 Li & Fung Ltd. , a trading company that generates two-thirds
of its sales in the U.S., jumped 7 percent to HK$38.30 in Hong
Kong. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent
of its revenue abroad, gained 3.2 percent to 2,690 yen in Tokyo.
Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea’s largest automaker, jumped 5.1
percent to 144,500 won. LIG Investment & Securities Co. raised
its estimate on the automaker’s share price by 20 percent.

to 671 yen. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its rating on the
company to “buy” from “neutral.”  Cnooc  advanced 4.7 percent
to HK$13.50 this week after HSBC Holdings Plc boosted the
company to “overweight” from “neutral.”  
 Nintendo , the world’s biggest maker of video-game machines,

unveiled a handheld player that shows 3-D images without special
glasses. UBS AG boosted its recommendation on the stock to
“buy” from “neutral.”
