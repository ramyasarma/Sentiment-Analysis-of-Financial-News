             OAO Uralkali , Russia’s second-
largest potash producer, rose the most in more than two weeks in
London trading after billionaire owner  Dmitry Rybolovlev  agreed
to sell a controlling stake.  
 Uralkali  depositary receipts advanced as much as 5.5
percent, the largest gain since May 28, and traded up 4.2
percent at $19.75 as of 8:50 a.m. local time.  
 Rybolovlev’s Madura Holding Ltd. disposed of 53.2 percent
of Uralkali to Kaliha Finance Ltd., Aerellia Investments Ltd.
and Becounioco Holdings Ltd., according to a statement today.
Kaliha, owned by billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov , acquired 25
percent, the largest stake.  
 Rybolovlev, who held about 66 percent of Uralkali through
Madura, is ranked by the Russian edition of Forbes magazine as
the country’s 10th richest man with a fortune of $8.6 billion.
He also owns about 25 percent of larger competitor OAO Silvinit.  
 Uralkali owns half of trader Belarusian Potash Co., which
controls 29 percent of the global market for the nutrient,
according to the company’s website. Uralkali cut potash output
by 45 percent last year to 2.6 million metric tons as demand for
the fertilizer dropped.
