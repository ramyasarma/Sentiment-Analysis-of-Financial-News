             Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, the state-
owned company known as PetroVietnam, may seek to buy liquefied
natural gas from Australian energy companies after visiting
several firms this year, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing an interview with Austrade’s Kuala Lumpur-based
trade commissioner Paul Martin. Vietnam is targeting more than
A$1 billion of energy exports from Australia to Vietnam by 2015,
the newspaper cited Martin as saying.
