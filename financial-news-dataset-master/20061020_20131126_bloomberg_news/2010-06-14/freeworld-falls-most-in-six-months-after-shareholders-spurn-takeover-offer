             Freeworld Coatings Ltd. , a South
African paint producer, fell the  most  in more than six months in
Johannesburg trading after investors spurned a takeover bid.  
 The stock  dropped  64 cents, or 6 percent, to 10 rand, its
biggest one-day decline since Dec. 7, reducing the Johannesburg-
based company’s market value to 2.04 billion rand ($270
million). Freeworld has gained 19 percent this year.  
 Shareholders didn’t approve a 10.45 rand a share offer led
by a group of private-equity funds controlled by Brait SA at a
meeting today, Freeworld said in a statement. The offer has now
lapsed, it said.
