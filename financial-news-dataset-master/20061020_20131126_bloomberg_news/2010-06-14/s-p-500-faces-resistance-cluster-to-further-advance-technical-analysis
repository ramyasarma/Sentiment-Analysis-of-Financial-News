             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
faces a “resistance cluster” of levels restricting further
gains following last week’s rally, according to technical
analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The S&P 500 rose 2.5 percent to 1,091.6 last week, the
biggest advance since March.  Michael Krauss  and  David Cohen ,
New-York based technical analysts at JPMorgan, called it a
“bullish reversal week” as the S&P 500 made a lower low than
the prior week but closed higher than the prior week’s close.  
 Further gains in the benchmark index for U.S. stocks will
face several resistance levels between 1,106 and 1,114, the
analysts wrote in a note to clients dated June 11. These include
the 200-day moving average at 1,107.95 and a  Fibonacci
retracement level  at 1,109. In addition, a gap that was formed
on the one-hour chart between the June 3 closing low of 1,100
and the June 4 opening high of 1,098 must be closed.  
 “The 1098-1100 gap and 1106-1114 resistance cluster will
be key for the near-term direction,” the analysts wrote.
“Sustained closes through there would imply a three-week base
pattern above the 1,041 lows.”  
 Last week’s advance pared the  S&P 500 ’s decline since April
23 to 10 percent. The index has fallen 2.1 percent this year
after concern that European budget deficits would lead to a
default forced the region’s regulators to intervene with a 750
billion-euro ($919 billion) rescue package.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  
 Fibonacci analysis assumes markets retrace earlier patterns
in specific stages. A Fibonacci retracement level is created by
taking two extreme points on a stock chart and dividing the
vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6 percent,
38.2 percent, 50 percent, 61.8 percent and 100 percent. If a
price breaks through one of the levels, it may signal a move
toward the next resistance or support point.
