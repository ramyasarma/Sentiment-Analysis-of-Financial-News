             Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  signaled
that Japan should extend a cap on new bond sales beyond next
fiscal year to help contain the expansion of the nation’s
growing debt burden.  
 “Even if we keep bond sales at 44.3 trillion yen ($482
billion) over three years, the debt-to- gross-domestic-product 
ratio will still exceed 200 percent,” Kan said in parliament
in Tokyo today. “So I think we need to uphold this kind of
goal at any cost.”  
 Kan took office this month pledging to spur economic
growth and restore the public finances as the largest debt load
in the industrialized world swells. His administration plans to
compile mid-term fiscal and economic growth plans by June 22,
National Strategy Minister  Satoshi Arai  said last week.  
 As finance chief in the previous administration, Kan had
said he wanted to cap bond sales at 44.3 trillion yen, the
amount budgeted this year, in the year starting April 1, 2011.  
 In an indication of his commitment to fiscal discipline he
said the ruling Democratic Party of Japan should include its
views on consumption tax and other changes to the tax system in
its policy platform ahead of mid-term elections in July.
