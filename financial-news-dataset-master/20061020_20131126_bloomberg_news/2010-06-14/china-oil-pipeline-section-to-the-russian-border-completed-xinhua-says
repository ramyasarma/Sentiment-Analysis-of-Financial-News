             China completed a 927 kilometer
(576 mile) stretch of a Russia-China crude oil pipeline in
northeast Heilongjiang province, according to the official
 Xinhua News Agency .  
 Russia may supply China with 15 million metric tons of
crude oil every year, Xinhua said. China’s section to the border
of Russia in Mohe County will go into operation in October,
Xinhua said today.  
 The planned 999 kilometer link will connect Russia’s East
Siberian Pacific Ocean Pipeline with PetroChina Co.’s Daqing
oilfield in Heilongjiang.  
 Russia agreed last year to supply crude oil to China 
for 20 years in return for loans, an official at China
National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina’s parent, said in 
February 2009.
