             ETF Securities Ltd. will offer 22
currency exchange-traded funds on the London Stock Exchange in a
bid to create more access to assets not always available to
international investors.  
 The funds include four so-called emerging-market exchange-
traded commodities with long and short exposure to the Chinese
renminbi, also known as the yuan, and the Indian rupee. The
remaining 18 products will be based on the British pound’s long
or short exposure to Group of 10 currencies. A long is a bet a
currency will increase and a short is a bet it will fall.  
 “Many emerging-market currencies are not accessible to
foreign investors due to restrictions or capital controls,” the
company said in a statement today. “Even though a currency such
as the Chinese renminbi is pegged to the U.S. dollar, it is
possible for emerging-market currency ETCs to change in price.”  
 China pegged the yuan to about 6.83 per dollar in July 2008
after allowing a 21 percent gain the previous three years.  
 ETF Securities, which has 28 long and short G-10 ETCs
versus the U.S. dollar and euro, said the products will be
available in “the next couple of weeks,” without being more
specific.
