             Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
agreed to buy Citigroup Inc.’s C$2.1 billion ($2.03 billion)
Canadian credit-card portfolio to add MasterCard to its
offerings and increase its card assets by 15 percent.  
 The deal makes CIBC, Canada’s fifth-biggest bank, the
largest dual credit-card issuer in the country, offering Visa
and MasterCard, the Toronto-based bank said today in a
statement. The price wasn’t disclosed and CIBC said the purchase
will add to earnings in the first year.  
 This is CIBC’s third  acquisition  since March. The bank
agreed on April 30 to buy CIT Business Credit Canada from
partner CIT Group Inc. to expand corporate lending. On March 2,
CIBC invested $150 million for a minority stake in Bank of N.T.
Butterfield & Son Ltd. to boost its presence in the Caribbean,
where it owns Barbados-based FirstCaribbean International Bank.  
 Citigroup sold the card portfolio as part of its efforts to
shed non-core assets, Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said
in a separate statement. New York-based Citigroup, the No. 3
U.S. lender, is focused on growing global banking, transaction
services and private banking in Canada, he said.  
 The MasterCard portfolio includes accounts associated with
Petro-Canada cards, CIBC said. The C$2.1 billion in credit-card
balances adds to CIBC’s C$14 billion portfolio, the bank said.  
 The transaction is expected to close by Oct. 31.
