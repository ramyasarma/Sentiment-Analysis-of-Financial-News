             Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. rose as
much as 1.6 percent in Mumbai and traded at 63.9 rupees as of
9:00 a.m. local time. The biggest refiner will buy 51 percent of
Equipav SA Acucar & Alcool for 25 percent less than it had
agreed with the Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer, the
Economic Times reported, citing an unidentified person close to
the deal. Shree Renuka will pay about 11.5 billion rupees for
the Brazilian company, less than the 15.3 billion rupees agreed
to in February, it said.
