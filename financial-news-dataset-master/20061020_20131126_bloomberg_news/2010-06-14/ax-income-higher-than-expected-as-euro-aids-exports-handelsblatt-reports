              Germany’s tax revenue in May
rose by 1.6 percent, the second consecutive increase after
falling for 14 straight months, as the weaker euro helped
Germany sell more goods abroad,  Handelsblatt  said, citing people
from Germany’s finance ministry it did not identify.  
 As tax revenue has been higher than budgeted for, Germany
will have to increase borrowing by only 65 billion euros ($79
billion) this year, compared to the current planning of 80.2
billion euros, the newspaper said.
