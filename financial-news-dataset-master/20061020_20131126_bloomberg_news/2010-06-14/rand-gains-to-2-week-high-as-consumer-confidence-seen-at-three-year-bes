             South Africa’s rand climbed to an
almost two-week high against the dollar before a report that is
expected to show consumer confidence stayed at a three-year
high, adding to signs the economy is recovering from recession.  
 The currency appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 7.6155
per dollar, the strongest level since June 3, before trading 0.4
percent up at 7.6525 by 10:29 a.m. in Johannesburg. Against the
euro, the rand lost 0.2 percent to 9.3315.  
 Consumer confidence  in South Africa, host of the monthlong
soccer World Cup competition, is expected to stay at 15 in the
second quarter, matching a reading in the first three months of
the year that was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2007,
according to the  median estimate  of four economists polled by
Bloomberg. U.S.  consumer sentiment  rose to its highest since
January 2008, a report late on June 11 showed.  
 “As long as the global economic recovery holds up then the
rand will remain generally quite firm,” said  John Cairns , head
of foreign-exchange research at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg.  
 Africa’s biggest  economy  expanded 4.6 percent in the first
three months of the year, the fastest pace in seven quarters, as
record low interest rates triggered a rebound in consumer
spending. Signs that Americans are gaining confidence boosted
sentiment that the global economic recovery won’t falter, even
as Europe’s debt crisis roils investors.  
 Government bonds rose, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 gaining 2 cents to 123.16 rand. The
yield on the bond fell less than 1 basis point to 7.99 percent.  
 South Africa’s consumer confidence index, which is compiled
by  First National Bank  and the Bureau for Economic Research, is
scheduled for release at 12 p.m. in Johannesburg.  
 Investors trimmed bets that the South African Reserve
Bank’s monetary policy committee will reduce the  benchmark
lending rate  when it next meets on July 2, forward-rate
agreements showed. The cost of  three-month contracts  for cash in
three months increased for the first day in six, adding 1.5
basis points to 6.415 percent. The rate reached a 6 1/2-year low
of 6.36 percent on April 21.
