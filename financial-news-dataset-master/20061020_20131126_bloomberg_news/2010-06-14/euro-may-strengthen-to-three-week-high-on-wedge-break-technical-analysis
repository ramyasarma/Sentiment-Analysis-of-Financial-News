             The euro may rise to a three-week
high against the dollar after it broke out of a so-called
descending wedge, according to Forecast Pte in Singapore.  
 Europe’s single currency climbed beyond $1.2097 last week,
the upper trend line of the descending wedge, signaling further
gains in coming weeks, said  Pak Lai Ng , a technical analyst at
Forecast, citing trading patterns. A descending wedge is
typically seen as “bullish,” according to Ng. The upper trend
line connects the highs of May 21 and June 3. The pattern is
formed by a series of lower highs and lower lows.  
 “With the wedge broken, the euro should go back to the
high of that wedge,” Ng said in an interview, citing the May
21 high of $1.2672.  
 The euro traded at $1.2221 as of 7:20 a.m. in Tokyo,
unchanged from New York yesterday. The currency has rebounded
2.9 percent since touching $1.1877 on June 7, its lowest level
since March 2006.  
 Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, also signal the euro may
advance against the greenback, Ng said.  
 The common currency’s MACD versus the dollar was minus
0.0172 today, compared with minus 0.0214 for the so-called
signal line, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The rise of
the MACD above the signal line suggests the euro will
strengthen, Ng said.  
 The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day
exponential moving average, or EMA, from the 12-day EMA. A
nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is plotted on
top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell
signals.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
