             Bulgarian  inflation  accelerated to
the fastest pace in 11 months in May on higher fuel costs and
increased excise duties on alcohol and tobacco.  
 The inflation rate rose to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent in
April, the National Statistics Institute in Sofia said today.
The median estimate of seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a rate of 1.9 percent. On the month, consumer prices
fell 0.2 percent.  
 Inflation in Bulgaria, which joined the European Union in
2007, plummeted from 11 percent a year ago as the recession cut
private consumption. The rate dropped to 0.6 percent at the end
of last year, compared with a government forecast of 1.8
percent. It began accelerating in February when the effects of
excise-tax increases and rising fuel prices hit.  
 Bulgaria, which scrapped plans to apply for the pre-euro
exchange-rate mechanism this year as its budget deficit widened,
expects a recovery from last year’s  recession  to spur year-end
inflation to 3.2 percent. The International Monetary Fund sees
the end-year inflation rate at 2.2 percent.
