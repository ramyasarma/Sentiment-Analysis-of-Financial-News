             Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS and
the Turkish tax office reached an accord over about 400 million
liras ($255 million) Turkcell allegedly owes in charges and
interest from unpaid taxes related to wireless roaming, a
spokesman for the tax office said.  
 The spokesman declined to be named or say how much Turkcell
agreed to repay, citing laws governing secrecy of such
agreements. The government is also talking with Vodafone Group
Plc and Avea about backtaxes owed for the roaming abroad, the
spokesman said.
