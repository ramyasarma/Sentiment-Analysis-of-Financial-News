             Peru’s sol was little changed as
rising copper prices were offset by demand for dollars from
local pension funds.  
 The sol traded at 2.8430 per U.S. dollar at 3:08 p.m. New
York time, from 2.8440 on June 11. The currency earlier touched
2.8410, the strongest level since May 21.  
 Copper futures rose for a fifth straight day as the
dollar’s decline boosted demand for commodities as an
alternative investment. The metal also climbed after a report
showed European industrial production increased more than
economists forecast in April, easing concern a debt crisis may
derail growth. Copper is Peru’s biggest export, earning the
country $726 million in April, the central bank said June 10.  
 “The sol followed the positive trend in commodities,”
said  Antonio Diaz , a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru.
“The decline in the dollar prompted pension funds to buy.”  
 The central bank didn’t  intervene  in the foreign-exchange
market today, it said on its website.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.93 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit.
