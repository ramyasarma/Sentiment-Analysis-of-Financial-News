             Former  Fujitsu Ltd.  President
 Kuniaki Nozoe  lost a court bid to be reinstated as a director
at the company, Japan’s biggest computer-services provider.  
 A Yokohama court rejected Nozoe’s petition on grounds
that the 62 year-old stepped down voluntarily, according to a
statement by Nozoe’s lawyers today. Nozoe filed an objection
asking the court to reconsider its ruling, according to the
statement.  
 Fujitsu said in March the executive resigned as
president in September after acknowledging ties to
“antisocial forces,” a euphemism in Japan for organized
crime. The company had previously said he had resigned for
health reasons. Nozoe denies the antisocial forces allegation
and says he was forced to quit after an hour-long
interrogation on Sept 25.  
 Fujitsu  gained 1.6 percent to close at 569 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, before the ruling was announced. The
shares have fallen 2.6 percent since the battle between the
company and its former chief became public on March 5, while
the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  has dropped 4.7
percent.  
 Fujitsu wasn’t immediately available for comment.  
 Proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co. this month said
shareholders should vote the company’s chairman and a
director off the board for their role in obscuring the
reasons for Nozoe’s dismissal. Fujitsu’s next board meeting
is scheduled for June 21.  
 Open Letter  
 Nozoe will send an open letter to Fujitsu asking the
company to explain why it has nominated some of its board
members for new terms, according to today’s statement from
Nozoe’s lawyers, Kunsen Gen and Mikito Ozawa. Nozoe will also
renew calls for an independent investigation into his claims,
according to the statement.  
 Fujitsu rejected earlier requests by Nozoe that the
company set up an independent committee to investigate his
dismissal and the allegations he had connections with the
yakuza. Ties to organized crime are grounds for delisting,
according to rules adopted in 2009 by the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
