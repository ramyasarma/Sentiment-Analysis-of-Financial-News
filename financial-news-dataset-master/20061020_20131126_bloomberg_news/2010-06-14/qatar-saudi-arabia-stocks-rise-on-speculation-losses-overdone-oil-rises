             Qatari and Saudi Arabian stocks
increased as oil approached $76 a barrel and investors
speculated that declines spurred by the European debt crisis are
overdone given growth prospects in the Gulf countries.  
 Masraf Al Rayan , a Qatar-based bank, gained the most in
more than six months.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp , the world’s
largest petrochemical maker known as Sabic, advanced 2.5
percent. Qatar’s  QE Index  rose 1.5 percent to 7,024.72, the
highest since May 20. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index 
gained 1.2 percent to 6,340.03, the highest in more than three
weeks. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  advanced 0.5 percent.  
 “We expect companies will have sequential quarterly
financial growth and will not be affected by a falling euro or a
defaulting Greece,” said  Yazan Abdeen , fund manager at ING
Investment Management (Dubai) Ltd. “The extreme sell-off has
eased and Saudi Arabia and Qatar have a lot of value and
selective story growth.”  
 The  GCC 200 Index  is valued at 16 times the earnings of its
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, near the
lowest since March 2009. The measure has lost 9.3 percent so far
this quarter. Gulf companies will begin announcing second-
quarter earnings next month.  
 Qatar’s index is up 3.5 percent and Saudi Arabia’s gauge
3.6 percent this month after respective losses of 9.7 percent
and 11 percent in May. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose as much
as 1.4 percent today. The measure has retreated 7.4 percent from
this year’s high on April 15 amid concern that efforts by
European nations to reduce their budget deficits may harm the
economy.  
 Crude Gains  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose to as high as $75.84 a
barrel and last traded at $75.69. Saudi Arabia holds about 20
percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.  
 The Saudi Arabian government said today inflation last
month accelerated to 5.4 percent, a 12-month high, as housing,
fuel and the cost of goods and services increased in the largest
Arab economy.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  fell 0.4 percent, the most since
June 6 and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  lost 0.3 percent.  
 “Most Gulf Arab Markets, especially Saudi Arabia, are
responding mainly to international trends,” said  Haissam Arabi ,
chief executive officer of Gulfmena Alternative Investments in
Dubai. “In the United Arab Emirates, there are internal fears
over debt restructuring and whether we are going to see a
double-digit recession, combined with the performance of
international markets.”  
 U.A.E. Growth  
 The U.A.E. economy may grow an average of 4 percent in 2010
and 2011 as the government embarks on nuclear power generation
and railway projects, Central Bank Governor  Sultan Bin Nasser al-Suwaidi  said in Singapore today.  
 Sabic rose 2.5 percent, the most since June 12, to 91.25
riyals. Masraf Al Rayan advanced 5.1 percent, the most since
Dec. 2, to 14.5 riyals.  
 Mobile Telecommunications Co.,  also known as Zain,
retreated 3.5 percent to 1,100 fils, the lowest since Feb. 11.
The Kuwaiti company’s Chief Executive Adviser for Saudi Affairs,
Khaled al-Hajeri, resigned after being appointed to the position
June 10, Al-Qabas reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.  
 Bahrain’s  gauge  increased 0.4 percent, while  the Kuwait
Stock Exchange Index  retreated 1.3 percent to the lowest in more
than three months. Oman’s  MSM30 Index  dropped 0.7 percent.
