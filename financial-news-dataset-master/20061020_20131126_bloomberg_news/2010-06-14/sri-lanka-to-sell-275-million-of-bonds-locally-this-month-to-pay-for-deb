             Sri Lanka plans to sell $275 million
of dollar-denominated bonds locally this month to pay for
maturing debt, three months after failing to raise a targeted
$100 million from a debt issue.  
 The South Asian nation will issue $175 million of two-year
debt and $100 million of three-year paper, the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka said on its  website  today. Subscriptions for the so-
called development bonds, which will pay a margin over the six-
month London interbank offered rate, close on June 18.  
 “Looking at the liquidity situation, I expect favorable
rates,”  C.J.P. Siriwardena , head of the central bank’s public
debt, said in a telephone interview. “We want to extend the
yield curve and maturity structure.”  
 President  Mahinda Rajapaksa , who was re-elected to a six-
year term in January, has pledged to spend $1 billion on ports,
roads and power plants this year to help drive economic growth
to as much as 7 percent.  
 The government is targeting a budget deficit of 7.5 percent
of gross domestic product in 2010, compared with an actual
shortfall of 9.7 percent last year. The International Monetary
Fund set a deficit target of 6 percent for this year when it
granted a $2.6 billion emergency loan in July 2009 to help the
nation tide over a foreign-exchange crisis.  
 Sri Lanka may find it “challenging” to meet this year’s
budget-deficit target as the government steps up spending to
rebuild infrastructure after the end of a three-decade-long
civil war, central bank Governor Nivard Cabraal said on Feb. 9.  
 The nation raised $92 million by selling development bonds
in March. The government sold $37 million of two-year bonds at a
weighted-average yield of 380 basis points above Libor and $55
million of three-year debt 395 basis points over Libor. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.
