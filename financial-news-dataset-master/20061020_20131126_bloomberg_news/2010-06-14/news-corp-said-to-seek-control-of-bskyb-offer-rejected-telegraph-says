             Rupert Murdoch-controlled  News Corp. 
said it made an offer to take full control of satellite TV
service  British Sky Broadcasting Plc .  
 BSkyB, the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV provider, rejected the
offer of 700 pence per share, it said today in a statement.
News Corp.’s offer for the 61 percent  stake  of BSkyB that it
doesn’t already own is valued at 7.8 billion pounds ($11.5
billion), the New York-based company said in a statement. BSkyB
has a  market value  of 10.5 billion pounds.  
 News Corp., led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Rupert Murdoch , could boost earnings and free cash flow by
taking full control of BSkyB, BTIG LLC analyst  Richard Greenfield  wrote in a note to clients yesterday. Murdoch, 79,
said on May 4 his company was evaluating how to use its $8.18
billion in cash.  
 BSkyB gained 14 pence to 600.5 pence yesterday in London
and has advanced 6.9 percent this year.  
 News Corp. recorded $176 million in earnings from its BSkyB
stake in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a $7 million
loss a year earlier. The satellite service’s operating profit
increased with the addition of high-definition TV subscribers.  
 News Corp. shares may benefit from full ownership of BSkyB
by eliminating a discount in the stock that reflects the partial
ownership,  Hale Holden , a Barclays Capital debt analyst, wrote
in a May 25 report. The decline in the value of the British
pound relative to the U.S. dollar may also have increased the
likelihood of such a deal, he said.  
 In December, News Corp. raised its stake in Sky Deutschland
AG, Germany’s biggest pay-TV service, to more than 45 percent.  
 News Corp., based in New York, fell 25 cents to $13.12 in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The Class A shares have fallen 4.2
percent this year.
