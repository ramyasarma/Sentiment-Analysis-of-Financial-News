             Customers of IndyMac Bancorp Inc.,
the California mortgage lender that failed two years ago, would
recover some of their $265 million in lost deposits under a
proposal offered by House lawmakers to the financial-overhaul
bill.  
 Pasadena-based IndyMac collapsed in July 2008, three months
before Congress temporarily boosted the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.’s insurance limit on individual deposits to
$250,000 from $100,000. House lawmakers are proposing making the
higher limit permanent and retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008.  
 “For the folks who had deposits that weren’t covered, it’s
going to be something that will be favored,”  Wayne Abernathy ,
the executive vice president of the American Bankers
Association, said in a telephone interview. “This will be paid
for by the banking industry.”  
 The  proposal  was released today by House lawmakers as part
of a package of proposed changes to the bill that aims to
overhaul regulation of Wall Street. House and Senate negotiators
are set to consider the changes tomorrow during the second
meeting of the committee working to merge the legislation passed
by each chamber.  
 IndyMac, the fourth-largest U.S. bank to fail, was seized
by regulators after a run by depositors depleted its cash.
Customer deposits were insured by the FDIC for as much as
$100,000 at the time, leaving about $265 million in uninsured
deposits, said FDIC spokesman  David Barr .  
 ‘More Even Treatment’  
 The proposed change “would provide a more even treatment
of uninsured depositors since the onset of the crisis,” Barr
said.  
 The FDIC previously arranged to give IndyMac depositors 50
percent of their money above the insurance limit, Barr said. For
example, a customer who had $300,000 on deposit at IndyMac has
already received $200,000 -- the $100,000 insured amount and
another $100,000 representing 50 percent of the $200,000 that
was uninsured.  
 If the $250,000 limit becomes retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008,
that customer would receive another $50,000 for a total of
$250,000, Barr said.  
 Congress in October 2008 temporarily raised the limit to
$250,000 through the end of 2009 as part of legislation to set
up a $700 billion financial-rescue package. Congress in 2009
approved legislation extending the limit to 2013.  
 The funds to reimburse customers of IndyMac and other banks
that failed in the nine-month period would come from the FDIC’s
deposit-insurance fund, Barr said. The fund, which is supported
through fees on the banking industry, had a $20.7 billion
deficit at the end of the first quarter, according to the latest
data from the FDIC. The fund balance reflects $40.7 billion the
FDIC has set aside to cover losses from anticipated bank
failures.  
 Credit Raters  
 Congressional negotiators tomorrow also are scheduled to
consider changes to language that sets up a national insurance
office, strengthens oversight of credit-rating firms and
requires hedge-fund managers to register with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  
 House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat, and Senate Banking Committee Chairman
 Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat, have said they would
like to complete negotiations and get a single bill for
President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 4.
