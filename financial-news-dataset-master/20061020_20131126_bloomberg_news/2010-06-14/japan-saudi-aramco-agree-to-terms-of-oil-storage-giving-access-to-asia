             Japan and Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
agreed to terms of a deal allowing the kingdom to use idle crude
oil storage on the island of Okinawa, giving the world’s biggest
crude-supplying nation better access to Asian markets.  
 Aramco, as the state oil company is known, will store as
much as 600,000 kiloliters of crude at the site with first
shipments due to arrive within the year, Hiroshi Oikawa,
director of petroleum refining and reserves at the trade
ministry, said by phone from Tokyo. He declined to give
financial details of the agreement.  
 The arrangement gives Aramco easier access to growing Asian
markets and a cushion against supply disruptions through the
Strait of Hormuz. Japan has made similar agreements with Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co. and Petroleo Brasileiro SA as declining
domestic fuel demand frees up storage space.  
 “Oil producers are tapping available storage facilities in
Japan in a bid to get crude to growing markets in Asia led by
China,” said  Hirofumi Kawachi , an energy analyst at Mizuho
Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Japan wants to make use of
idle storage tanks by lending them to someone else.”
