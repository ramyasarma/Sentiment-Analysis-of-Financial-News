             Spain plans to replace its system of
premiums paid for renewable energy with a system of regulated 
tariffs that would give companies a yield on their investment 
of between 7 percent and 8 percent, Cinco Dias reported.  
 The change, if it takes effect, would affect existing 
plants and mean a cut in premiums of about 2.6 billion euros 
($3.2 billion), the newspaper said, citing proposals drafted by
the industry ministry and sent to companies. The reduction 
would hit photovoltaic energy premiums to the tune of 1.05 
billion euros and solar-thermal  energy by 1.1 billion euros, 
the newspaper said.
