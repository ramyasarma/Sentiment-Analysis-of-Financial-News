             New Hampshire will use money raised
by auctioning carbon dioxide permits in the U.S. Northeast’s
cap-and-trade program to help close the state’s $295 million
budget shortfall.  
 A budget bill approved by the New Hampshire Legislature and
signed into law June 10 by Democratic Governor  John Lynch 
diverts $3.1 million that would have been spent on energy-
efficiency and renewable electricity projects into the state’s
general fund, according to a  summary  of the plan.  
 “This action still leaves sufficient funds to invest,”
Colin Manning, Lynch’s spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview.  
 New Hampshire has  received  $24.4 million from the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative’s eight carbon dioxide permit auctions
since September 2008. New York, the largest member of the 10-
state cap-and-trade program, used $90 million in carbon permit
revenue last year to help cover a budget shortfall and New
Jersey has proposed using $65.2 million for the same purpose.  
 Besides spending carbon dioxide permit revenue on
pollution-cutting projects, New Hampshire is taking other steps
to reduce greenhouse gases, including a  requirement  that the
state’s utilities get 25 percent of their electricity from
renewable sources such as wind farms and biomass-fueled power
plants by 2025, Manning said.
