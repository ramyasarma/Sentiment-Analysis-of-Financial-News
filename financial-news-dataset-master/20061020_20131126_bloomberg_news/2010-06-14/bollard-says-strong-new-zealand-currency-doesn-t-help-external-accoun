             New Zealand’s strong currency has
not helped efforts to reduce the nation’s large investment
income deficit and overall external liabilities, Reserve Bank
Governor  Alan Bollard  said.  
 “The trade balance has improved with strong export prices
and less demand for imports,” Bollard said in a speech to a
Wellington business audience today. “But a large deficit on the
investment income balance is showing no signs of enduring
improvement and the strong New Zealand dollar has not helped.”  
 New Zealand’s currency has gained 7.6 percent against the
U.S. dollar the past year, curbing exports which make up 30
percent of the economy. Bollard last week forecast the  current
account deficit , the broadest measure of trade, will widen to
7.2 percent of gross domestic product by March 2013 from 3.3
percent in the year through March 2010.  
 The investment income deficit is showing little sign of
enduring improvement, he said today.  
 “It will be difficult to improve this metric as that would
require us to get our net external debt position on to a
downward trend and that would require a significant change in
historic patterns of inward and outward investment,” he said.  
 Notes of his speech were e-mailed to Bloomberg News.
