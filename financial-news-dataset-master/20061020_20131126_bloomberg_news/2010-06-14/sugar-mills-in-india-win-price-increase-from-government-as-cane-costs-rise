             India, the world’s biggest sugar
consumer, increased the price paid to mills for refined supply
under a government program, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said.  
 Producers will be paid as much as 18 rupees (39 cents) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) for supply in the crop year ending Sept.
30, up from an average of 13.05 rupees last season, he told
reporters today in New Delhi. The new price will apply to the
entire crop year retrospectively, he said.  
 India’s sugar mills are required to sell 20 percent of
their production at below-market prices to the government for
resale to the poor under the so-called levy quota. The mills can
sell their remaining output at market rates. The government
controls the sugar market by telling mills how much they should
sell each month.  
 The government plans to pare the levy quota from 20 percent
to 16 percent to increase the supply to the open market, Pawar
said today. The proposal will be discussed at the next meeting
of a ministerial panel on food, he said.  
 Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd. and other mills paid cane growers as
much as 280 rupees for 100 kilograms in the current season, more
than the government-set price of 129.84 rupees, to secure supply.
India, also the world’s second-biggest sugar producer, imported
record amounts of mostly raw sugar after a drought last year
parched fields. Brazil is the largest producer.
