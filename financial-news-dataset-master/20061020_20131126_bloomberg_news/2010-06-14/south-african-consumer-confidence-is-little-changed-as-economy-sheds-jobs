             South African  consumer confidence 
was little changed in the second quarter as job losses mounted,
raising concern about the strength of the  economy ’s recovery
from last year’s recession.  
 The FNB/BER  consumer confidence  index fell to 14 from 15 in
the first three months of the year,  First National Bank  and the
 Bureau for Economic Research  said on their websites today.  
 The economy shed 171,000 jobs in the first quarter, pushing
the  unemployment rate  to 25.2 percent, the highest of 62
countries tracked by Bloomberg. Job losses and weak consumer
spending led  business confidence  to slump in the second quarter,
with the index dropping to 36 from 43, Rand Merchant Bank said
on June 8. That may stall growth in Africa’s biggest economy,
which expanded an annualized 4.6 percent in the first quarter.  
 There is “deep unwillingness in important consumer
segments to buy consumer durables at this time and to incur the
associated debt,” First National Bank said. For spending to
improve “this requires, among other things, a recovery in
employment to boost income and a rebalancing of household
balance sheets to stimulate credit spending.”  
 The Reserve Bank has cut its  benchmark interest rate  seven
times to 6.5 percent since December 2008 to spur consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of expenditure in the
economy.  Retail sales  rose for the first time in 14 months in
March, gaining an annual 1 percent, the statistics office said
on May 19.
