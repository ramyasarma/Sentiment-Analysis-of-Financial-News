             Australian lawmakers may pass paid
parental leave legislation as soon as today, the Australian
Financial Review reported, without saying where it got the
information. The opposition has indicated it won’t block the
bill, the newspaper said. The legislation gives either new
parent up to 18 weeks leave at the minimum wage rate of A$544
per week, according to the Review.
