             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  may
raise as much as $15 billion in the Hong Kong part of what could
be the world’s largest initial public offering, according to an
e-mail sent to investors.  
 The bank, China’s largest by number of customers, will sell
$10 billion to $15 billion of shares in Hong Kong, according to
the e-mail to institutions. Banks arranging the IPO will start
gauging investor demand for the sale today, the document said.
Agricultural Bank is also selling stock in Shanghai.  
 Agricultural Bank may raise at least $23 billion from the
total offering, people with knowledge of the matter said last
week. The IPO, likely to surpass the $22 billion sale by
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in 2006, coincides
with an equities rout that’s caused more than 30 companies to
cancel or delay IPOs globally since the end of April, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “The market is still very discerning,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1.1 billion at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “The deal has got to be really
attractively priced to get away with it.”  
 Agricultural Bank, based in Beijing, is starting the IPO
after the  MSCI World Index  has slid nearly 10 percent since the
end of April amid concerns about the European debt crisis and
worries about global economic recovery.  
 Pulled Sale  
 Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. , a Chinese wind-
turbine maker, scrapped a plan to raise as much as HK$9.09
billion ($1.2 billion) in a Hong Kong share sale, said two
people with knowledge of the matter today. Some investors
decided to skip the Goldwind offering in favor of Agricultural
Bank’s IPO, according to one person, who declined to be
identified because it hasn’t been publicly announced. Goldwind
spokesman  Thomas Yao  declined to comment.  
 Agricultural Bank is selling 25.4 billion shares in Hong
Kong and 22.2 billion shares in Shanghai, it said in a  draft
prospectus  posted on China Securities Regulatory Commission’s
website. The top end of Hong Kong offering size indicated in
today’s e-mail would allow the bank to raise $19 billion to $28
billion in the two cities combined.  
 Agricultural bank is reserving as much as 40 percent of the
Hong Kong shares for corporate investors who will agree not to
sell their holdings for a few months in exchange, said two
people with knowledge on June 9. Rabobank Groep NV, Qatar
Investment Authority, Kuwait Investment Authority and  Archer
Daniels Midland Co.  were among those in advanced talks to buy
shares through this arrangement, they added.  
 Agricultural Bank plans to start taking orders from
institutions for the Hong Kong share sale on June 24 and price
it on July 6, said a separate e-mail to investors. The stock
will start trading in Hong Kong on July 16.  
 China International Capital Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG,
Macquarie Group Ltd. and ABCI Securities are managing the sale.
