             India’s stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index to its highest level in a month, as investors
bought shares in companies that are most likely to benefit from
economic expansion.  
 Reliance Industries Ltd. , operator of the world’s largest
oil processing complex, climbed to its highest in a month after
agreeing to take control of Infotel Broadband Services Ltd.,
giving it access to the wireless Internet business. State-run
 IDBI Bank Ltd.  jumped the most in more than four months after
the government approved a plan to inject funds to bolster its
capital.  
 “There is a surge in confidence in Indian companies,”
said  Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New
Delhi-based brokerage. “Investors should buy stocks with a view
of the next one to three years as the economic fundamentals are
very strong.” Gupta advises investors to buy shares in
financial companies, banks, automobile and auto parts makers,
while declining to name specific stocks.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,

Capital Ltd., said. Reliance, which briefed analysts June 12,
will also pay 128.5 billion rupees for Internet services
licenses earmarked for Infotel.

nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
