             Kenya’s shilling depreciated the
most in a week after an explosion at a rally yesterday to oppose
a new constitution killed six people, raising concern about
political stability.  
 The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.7 percent to 81.18 versus the dollar and traded 0.6
percent down at 81.10 as of 11:03 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.
Kenya’s  All-Share Index  retreated as much as 0.5 percent before
increasing less than 0.1 percent to 73.77.  
 At least 75 people were injured in the rally in a park in
downtown Nairobi, Kenya Television News reported, citing
hospital workers. The rally was led by religious leaders and
politicians who oppose the constitution that is scheduled to be
put to a national referendum on Aug. 4.  
 “We expected there would be some reaction to the bad news
of the explosion,” Steve Lagat, a dealer at CCFC Stanbic Bank
Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi today.  
 Protesters disagree with a clause that stipulates women can
terminate pregnancies that pose a risk to their health and
another, which is also in the current constitution, that
recognizes Islamic law.  
 The adoption of a new constitution was a key element of a
power-sharing accord decided in 2008 to end post-election
violence that killed 1,500 Kenyans and displaced another
300,000. It is meant to replace the current charter dating back
to the country’s independence from Britain in 1963, in which the
president holds most power. The draft aims to decentralize
government decision-making and curb abuses of authority by the
state.
