             Wheat rose to a two-week high as wet
weather slowed the harvest of winter varieties in the U.S.
Soybeans rose as rain may prevent seeding in some areas.  
 As much as six times the normal precipitation fell last
week in parts of Kansas, the biggest U.S. winter-wheat producer,
where the harvest is under way, and in Iowa and Illinois, the
largest soybean producers, where crops are being planted,
National Weather Service  data  show. Heavy rain also has
prevented wheat seeding in Canada, according to the Canadian
Wheat Board.  
 “This wet weather is supporting the market a little bit,”
said  Darrell Holaday , the president of Advanced Market Concepts
in Manhattan, Kansas. “The last 7 or 8 percent of soybeans may
be getting in later than we’d like. There are some concerns out
of Canada -- it’s been so wet. The wheat market needs these
supply jolts to move it up.”  
 Wheat futures for July delivery rose 11 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $4.68 a bushel at 10:08 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.685, the highest price for the most-
active contract since May 28. The grain gained 4.9 percent last
week, partly because wet weather delayed harvesting in parts of
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the biggest producers of winter
varieties.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 7.75 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $9.1675a bushel in Chicago. The price has fallen
12 percent this year.
