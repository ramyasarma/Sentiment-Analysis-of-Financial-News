             Astellas Pharma Inc.  and  Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH  said their telmisartan drug used to lower blood
pressure is safe based on patient studies, refuting a finding
that tied the medicine to cancer risk.  
 Studies involving 50,000 patients for as long as five years
showed no association between the drug and increased risk of
cancer, the companies said in a  statement  today. The medicine is
sold under the brand name Micardis.  
 A study published in the Lancet Oncology journal linked a
class of drugs used to reduce blood pressure, which includes
telmisartan, with a “modestly increased risk of new cancer
diagnosis,” according to the statement. The study is mainly
based on a combination of telmisartan and another treatment
ramipril, rather than individual medicines, it said.  
 Boehringer and Tokyo-based Astellas jointly sell Micardis
in Japan. Closely held Boehringer, of Ingelheim, Germany, sells
the drug overseas with companies including Bayer AG and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc.  
 Astellas  rose  0.8 percent to close at 2,974 yen in Tokyo
trading. The stock has declined 14 percent this year, compared
with a 3.2 percent drop for Japan’s benchmark Topix index.
