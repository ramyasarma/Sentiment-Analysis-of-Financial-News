             The yen traded near a one-week low
versus the dollar as speculation the worldwide economic recovery
is intact damped demand for the safety of Japan’s currency.  
 The yen was close to a four-week low versus New Zealand’s
dollar before reports that may show manufacturing in the New
York region expanded at a faster pace and U.K. inflation stayed
above the government’s 3 percent upper limit. The euro retreated
from near a two-week high versus the greenback after Moody’s
Investors Service lowered Greece’s credit rating to junk.  
 “Markets appear increasingly confident that the global
recovery will be sustained,” said  Mike Jones , a currency
strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington. “Risk
appetite is recovering, reintroducing downward pressure on the
‘safe haven’ currencies like the yen.”  
 Japan’s currency traded at 91.65 per dollar as of 9:34 a.m.
in Tokyo from 91.58 in New York yesterday, when it weakened to
92.12, the lowest level since June 4. The yen was at 112.04 per
euro from 111.92. Europe’s single currency bought $1.2225 from
$1.2221 yesterday, when it advanced to $1.2299, the strongest
since June 3.  
 New Zealand’s dollar traded at 63.78 yen from 63.62 yen
yesterday, when it strengthened to 64.43, the highest level
since May 18. New Zealand’s benchmark interest rate of 2.75
percent, compared with Japan’s key rate of 0.1 percent, makes
its assets relatively attractive to investors.  
 Growth Signs  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index rose to 20 in June from 19.1 the previous month, according
to a Bloomberg survey before today’s report. U.K. consumer
prices increased 3.5 percent in May from a year earlier, after a
3.7 percent increase in April, a separate Bloomberg survey
showed before the data is released today.  
 The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro
and the yen, climbed to 86.627 from 86.511 yesterday, when it
fell to 86.184, the lowest since June 1.  
 The euro reversed gains yesterday after Moody’s said it
downgraded Greece’s government bond ratings by four levels to
Ba1, below investment grade, from A3. The outlook is stable, the
company said.  
 Moody’s cited “substantial” risks to Greece’s economic
growth from the austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro
($134 billion) aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund.  
 ‘Remain Bearish’  
 “We remain bearish on the euro, given that the euro-zone
debt crisis is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon,” said
 Gareth Berry , a currency strategist at UBS AG in Singapore.
“The austerity measures which are designed to deal with the
crisis will likely act as a drag on future growth. We continue
to forecast the euro at $1.15 in three months.”  
 Greece has slashed spending, increased taxes and cut wages
to address the deficit, which widened to 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product last year, more than four times the European
Union limit. To secure aid from the EU and IMF, the government
pledged to trim the shortfall to 8.1 percent of GDP this year
and bring it back under the 3 percent EU ceiling in 2014.
