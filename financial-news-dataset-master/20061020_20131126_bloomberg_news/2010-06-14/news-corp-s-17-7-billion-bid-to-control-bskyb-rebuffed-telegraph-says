             News Corp.  made an offer to take
full control of satellite broadcaster  British Sky Broadcasting
Plc , valuing the company at about 12 billion pounds ($17.7
billion), the Daily Telegraph reported.  
 BSkyB, the U.K.’s biggest pay-television provider, rejected
the offer, made last week, because the company considered it too
low, the Telegraph said. The broadcaster has a market value of
$15.5 billion. News Corp., owner of the Wall Street Journal, has
a 39 percent  stake  in the broadcaster, the newspaper said.  
 News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  could boost earnings and free cash flow by taking full
control of the broadcaster, BTIG LLC analyst  Richard Greenfield 
wrote in a note to clients last month. BSkyB was still
considering its options late yesterday, the Telegraph said.  
 BSkyB spokesman  Robert Fraser  declined to comment. It’s
being advised by Morgan Stanley and UBS, the newspaper said.
News Corp. spokeswoman  Alice Macandrew  also declined to comment.  
 News Corp. recorded $176 million in earnings from its stake
in BSkyB in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a $7
million loss a year earlier. BSkyB’s operating profit was
boosted as it added high-definition TV subscribers.  
 News Corp., based in New York, fell 25 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $13.12 at 5:19 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite  trading . The shares have fallen 4.2 percent
this year.
