             The British pound is vulnerable to
declines on sovereign-debt risks and U.K. inflation may erode
the value of longer-term debt, said Pacific Investment
Management Co., which runs the world’s biggest bond fund.  
 Shorter-term bonds are likely to offer the best total
returns in the U.K. as the Bank of England holds down interest
rates, said  Michael Amey , executive vice president of U.K. fixed
income for Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, in a piece
posted on the company’s  website . Pimco prefers to be overweight
currencies of high-quality  emerging markets  and to hedge against
British price pressures using the inflation-linked debt of non-
U.K. industrialized nations, he wrote.  
 “The current outlook for the U.K. is one of low short-term
interest rates for a multi-year period with some longer-term
inflation risks,” Amey said. “We think the British pound
remains vulnerable, not least because it is the primary
mechanism used to reflect U.K. sovereign risk.”  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is set to
outline the deepest spending cuts since the 1970s in an
emergency budget on June 22 to tackle a deficit that ballooned
to 11.1 percent of GDP in the fiscal year through March. Fitch
Ratings said last week that Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
coalition needs to step up the pace of reductions to protect
Britain’s top credit rating.  
 Sterling dropped 8.5 percent this year to $1.4749 as of
10:03 a.m. in Tokyo. The 10-year gilt yield rose eight basis
points to 3.54 percent yesterday.  
 Credit Default Swaps  
 “We do not expect the U.K. to fail in meeting its
commitments,” Amey wrote. “We believe exposure to the U.K. in
the credit default swap market offers a valuable opportunity for
sophisticated investors.”  
 The cost of protecting British government debt against
default for five years reached as high as 101.3 basis points on
Feb. 4, the most since April 2009, and traded at 84.3 yesterday.
Its four-year average is 55.3 basis points.  
 Credit-default swaps are derivatives that pay the buyer
face value if a borrower -- a country or a company -- defaults.
In exchange, the swap seller gets the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent.
