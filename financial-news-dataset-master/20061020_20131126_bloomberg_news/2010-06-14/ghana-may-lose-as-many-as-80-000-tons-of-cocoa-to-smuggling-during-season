             Ghana may lose 60,000 to 80,000
metric tons of cocoa to smuggling during the 2009-10 season,
Ghana Cocoa Board Chief Executive Officer Tony Fofie said.  
 Ghana may produce 50,000 tons during light crop, barring
the effect of smuggling, he said in a telephone interview from
the capital, Accra. Cocoa smuggling was previously estimated to
be between 40,000 and 50,000 tons, Fofie said.
