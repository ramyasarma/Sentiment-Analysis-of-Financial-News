             Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a
vehicle in the West Bank today, killing an Israeli police
officer and wounding two others, police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said.  
 Two groups linked to the Fatah movement of Palestinian
Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  claimed responsibility for the
attack in an e-mailed statement to journalists.  
 Police are searching for the assailants, Rosenfeld said in
