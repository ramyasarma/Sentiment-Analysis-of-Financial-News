             Argentina’s biggest union wants to
raise the minimum wage 30 percent to 2,000 pesos ($510) per
month because of  inflation , newspaper El Cronista reported.  
 Hugo Moyano, head of Argentina’s  General Labor
Confederation , will discuss the proposal with President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  this week, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said, citing labor leaders it didn’t identify.  
 The government is seeking an increase in the minimum wage,
which is earned by about 500,000 workers, of no more than 23.5
percent, Cronista said.
