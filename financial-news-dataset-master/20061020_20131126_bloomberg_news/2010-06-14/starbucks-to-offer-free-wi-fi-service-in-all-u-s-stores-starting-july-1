             Starbucks Corp.  will offer free Wi-
Fi in all of its U.S. stores through AT&T Inc. starting July 1,
Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said today.  
 “This is specifically about enhancing the experience,
enhancing the brand, and giving people a reason to come to
Starbucks and stay as long as you want,” Schultz said at Wired
magazine’s “Disruptive by Design” business conference in New
York.  
 The Seattle-based company will offer access to exclusive
information and content with Yahoo! Inc. in the fall, Schultz
said. The Starbucks Digital Network will include unrestricted
access to paid websites, such as the Wall Street Journal, as
well as local community news and free downloads.  
 “The key aspect of everything we’ve ever done as a
company is create this third place between home and work,”
Schultz said.  
 Starbucks rose 44 cents, or 1.6 percent to $27.59 at 1:40
p.m. New York time in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares had gained 18 percent this year before today.
