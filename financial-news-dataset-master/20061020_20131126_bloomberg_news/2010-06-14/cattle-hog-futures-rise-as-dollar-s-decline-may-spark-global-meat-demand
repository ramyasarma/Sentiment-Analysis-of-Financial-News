             Cattle futures rose the most in a
week and hogs climbed on speculation that global demand for U.S.
beef and pork will increase as the dollar drops and equities
rally.  
 The  dollar  fell for the fourth time in five sessions
against a basket of six currencies, boosting the appeal of U.S.
exports. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained as much as 1.3
percent. U.S. beef exports in the four months ended April 30
surged 26 percent from a year earlier, and pork exports rose 1.5
percent, the Department of Agriculture said on June 11.  
 Futures got “a little bit of a bounce just because of the
stock market, and the dollar being down,” said  Mark Schultz , a
vice president at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.85 cent, or 1
percent, to 88.125 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, marking the biggest gain since June 2.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained 0.35
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.10425 a pound.  
 Hog futures for August settlement climbed 1.425 cents, or
1.8 percent, to 81.775 cents a pound. Earlier, the price reached
82 cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since
June 3.  
 Cattle futures plunged to a five-month low on June 11 as
 wholesale-beef  prices dropped to the lowest level since March.
Declines may have been exaggerated with equity and currency
markets signaling a demand rebound, said  Andrew Gottschalk , an
analyst at HedgersEdge.com LLC in Greenwood Village, Colorado.  
 Beef extended a slide at midday to $1.5302 a pound,
according to the USDA.  
 ‘A Little Bounce’  
 “There’s a little better feel in the financial markets,”
Gottschalk said. Cattle markets “were oversold from last week’s
selling pressure, so no one should be surprised that we’re
getting a little bounce today,” he said.  
 Wholesale pork  climbed to 83.99 cents a pound on June 11,
up 1.3 percent from an eight-week low on June 9, according to
the USDA. Low meat prices may spur retail buying before the U.S.
Independence Day holiday on July 4, when many consumers grill
outdoors, Northstar’s Schultz said.  
 “I’m hoping that it’s been down enough where maybe we’ll
get some buying interest,” he said.
