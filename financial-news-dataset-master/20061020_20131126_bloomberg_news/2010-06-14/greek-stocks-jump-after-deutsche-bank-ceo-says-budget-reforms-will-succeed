             Greek stocks surged the most in five
weeks after  Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  said Greece will succeed in implementing reforms to
reduce its budget deficit.  
 The  ASE  Index advanced 56.56, or 3.8 percent, to 1,540.69
in Athens trading, the biggest gain among 18 western European
benchmark indexes today. The  FTSE/ASE 20 Index  of Greece’s
biggest companies rose 4.3 percent to 740.92.  The Cypriot
General Index  added 3.5 percent to 1,140.25.  
 Ackermann said on June 12 that he was confident Greece
could repay its debt obligations based on Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s personal commitment to implement necessary reforms
“however difficult they are, even sacrificing his own political
future.”  
 Papandreou has raised taxes, trimmed wages and reduced
spending in a bid to tame the deficit, which widened to 13.6
percent of gross domestic product last year, more than four
times the European Union limit. To secure the EU aid, the
government pledged to trim the shortfall to 8.1 percent this
year and bring it back within the EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014.  
 “These positive comments and any positive feedback from
the committee are likely to trigger a positive reaction in the
market,”  Panagiotis Kladis  and Vassilis Kourmpetis, analysts at
National P&K Securities in Athens, said in an e-mailed note
today.  
 Deficit Narrowed  
 Greece’s budget deficit narrowed 38.8 percent to 8.97
billion euros ($11 billion) in the first five months of the
year, according to an announcement on June 10 from the Athens-
based Finance Ministry. That beat the 35 percent target in the
country’s budget plan, the ministry said.  
 Euro-area nations and the International Monetary Fund
agreed on May 2 agreed to provide 110 billion euros ($135
billion) in emergency loans to Greece, which is struggling to
cut the region’s second-widest budget gap. In exchange for the
aid, the government pledged to implement austerity measures of
almost 14 percent of GDP over four years.  
 EU and IMF officials began talks in Athens today as part of
regular checks on the government’s budget plans, which are being
monitored. EU spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  said today the body was
“optimistic” and that the work ahead was hard “but is
proceeding well.”  
 National Bank, Alpha  
  National Bank of Greece SA , the country’s biggest lender,
advanced 5.7 percent to 10.25 euros, rising for a second day.
 EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA , the second largest, gained 6.4 percent
to 4.19 euros. Alpha Bank SA rose 3.3 percent to 4.75 euros,
while Piraeus Bank SA jumped 2.8 percent to 4.01 euros.  
 Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA  gained 2.5 percent to
17.7 euros, erasing most of a 2.8 percent drop the previous
trading day. The world’s second-biggest bottler of Coke
beverages acquired 70,000 of its own shares at an average price
of 17.72 euros apiece on June 10, according to an Athens  bourse
filing  today.  
 Hellenic Petroleum SA  advanced 1.3 percent to 6.08 euros, a
fifth straight day of gains. Greece’s biggest refiner got
shareholder approval to pay a dividend of 45 cents a share on
2009 earnings, according to an Athens bourse filing today.  
 Motor Oil Hellas SA  added 0.9 percent to 7.57 euros, paring
a 1.3 percent fall the previous trading day. Greece’s second-
biggest refiner got approval from the country’s competition
watchdog on its planned acquisition of Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
Greek operations and liquid-gas unit.
