             Turkey’s Constitutional Court is set
to halt changes to the constitution passed by parliament that 
are due to be voted on at a nationwide referendum, Star said 
citing a conversation between a judge of the court and former 
Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay.  
 The judge allegedly told Oktay, who is a member of the main
opposition Republican People’s Party, of the court’s decision 
during a phone conversation on May 5, the Istanbul-based 
newspaper reported.  
 Though the court isn’t specifically enpowered under laws to
halt the changes, it decided to lay down a legal precedent, 
Star said citing the judge.
