             Ukraine will be able to purchase as
much as 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year once it
builds a liquefied natural gas terminal in Odessa, Interfax-
Ukraine news agency reported, citing Fuel and Energy Minister
 Yuriy Boyko .  
 The terminal will cost about $1 billion and Ukraine expects
to get financing from the European Union, Boyko told the Kiev-
based newswire.  
 Ukraine will be able to extract between 7 billion and 10
billion cubic meters of shale gas and coal methane in three to
four years, Boyko said, according to Interfax. The country wants
to sign an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell Plc by the end of
the year to explore for methane and shale gas, it reported.
