             Investment Dar Co. , the Kuwait-based
owner of half of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., and its creditors
agreed to most commercial aspects of restructuring its
liabilities, the company’s creditors committee said.  
 Relevant documents will be presented to a Kuwaiti court in
a few weeks for approval, the committee said in an e-mailed
statement today. Provided the court approves Investment Dar’s
restructuring plan, the first payment of profits will be made by
March 31, 2011, according to the statement. The first fixed
amortization payment will be by Sept. 30 next year.  
 Investment Dar, which missed a payment on a $100-million
Islamic bond in May last year, said in March it started a
process of legal protection under Kuwait’s Financial Stability
Law to implement a restructuring plan. The stability law was
enacted by the Kuwaiti government in April 2009 to bolster
financial institutions hurt by the credit crisis.  
 The company started talks last year to restructure its debt
after the global financial crisis hit Kuwaiti banks and
investment firms, forcing the government to guarantee all local
bank deposits in 2008. The company, which had 1.03 billion
dinars ($3.5 billion) of debt outstanding at the end of
September 2008, presented a plan to investors in December.  
 “As part of the restructuring plan documentation,
Investment Dar presented a revised budget and 5-year business
plan to the Coordinating Committee at a meeting in Dubai on May
24,” the statement said. The budget and business plan have yet
to be agreed by the committee, it said.
