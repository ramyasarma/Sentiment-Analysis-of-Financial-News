             Gold fell for the third time in four
sessions as a rally in the euro reduced demand for the precious
metal as a haven. Platinum rose the most in two weeks.  
 The euro rose as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar
after European industrial production rose more than forecast in
April, easing concern that a sovereign-debt crisis in the region
would derail the economy. Gold surged to a record $1,254.50 an
ounce on June 8 amid mounting budget concerns.  
 “A lot of the risk trade has abated with a rally in the
euro,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “That’s the biggest reason to sell gold.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $11, or 0.9
percent, to $1,219.20 an ounce at 12:04 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price has dropped 2.8 percent from the all-time high.  
 Before today, the metal climbed 12 percent this year as the
euro tumbled 15 percent against the dollar on concern that the
region’s fiscal crisis will hamper a global economic recovery.  
 Gold futures gained in the previous nine years. Holdings in
the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by
bullion, have increased 15 percent in 2010.  
 The metal may be too expensive for jewelers, analysts said.  
 “The challenge for gold is to replicate the heightened ETF
demand that occurred in the second half of May,”  Edel Tully , an
analyst at UBS AG in London, said in a report. “On the scrap-
supply front, metal is visible, but this supply source is not at
extreme levels. Jewelry demand from India and other regional
hubs in Asia is also sedate.”  
 Platinum, Palladium  
 Precious metals with wider industrial applications rallied
on bets that demand for raw materials will increase as the
global economy recovers. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials rose the most in a month.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $27.70, or 1.8
percent, to $1,562.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. A close at the price would mark the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since May 26.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery gained $12.50, or
2.8 percent, $461.05 an ounce.  
 Silver futures for July delivery rose 16.9 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $18.40 an ounce on the Comex.
