             Japanese  stock   futures  fell as a
reduction of Greece’s credit rating raised concerns the global
economic recovery may slow. Australian futures gained.  
 American depositary receipts of Panasonic Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of home electronics that gets 10 percent
of its revenue in Europe, lost 1.1 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s largest bank by market value, gained 0.6 percent
after its share price estimate was increased at Nomura Holdings
Inc. Those of National Australia Bank Ltd. climbed 0.4 percent.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,840 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,865 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,850 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index increased 0.2 percent in Wellington.  
 “Shares will unlikely advance because of the bad news
about Greece,” said  Yasushi Noguchi , strategist at SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “That may encourage investors to sell to lock in
recent gains.”  
 In New York, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2
percent to 1,089.63 yesterday as Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Greece’s government bond rating to junk, cutting the
grade four levels to Ba1 from A3, and as the S&P 500 failed to
hold above levels watched by traders who base investment
decisions on charts.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has declined 5.2 percent this
year, compared with drops of 2.3 percent by the  S&P 500  and 0.5
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.7 times for the Stoxx.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
nickel and copper jumped 2.8 percent yesterday.  
 The yen appreciated to 91.62, compared with 91.97 against
the dollar at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 111.88 from
112.07. The stronger yen reduces income when overseas revenue is
converted into local currency.
