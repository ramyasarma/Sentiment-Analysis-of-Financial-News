             U.S. stocks fell after a downgrade
of Greece halted an early rally and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index failed to hold above levels monitored by traders who base
investment decisions on charts.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Wells Fargo & Co. lost more than
1.5 percent as financial shares in the S&P 500 reversed an
earlier 1.1 percent rally.  Newmont Mining Corp.  helped lead  raw-
materials producers  lower as gold fell for the third time in
four days.  Apollo Group Inc. , the largest U.S. for-profit
university, slid 6.9 percent for the worst drop in the S&P 500.  
 The  S&P 500  lost 0.2 percent to 1,089.63 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  decreased 20.18 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 10,190.89. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent to
1,105.91 earlier, the highest intraday since May 20 and near its
200-day average of about 1,108, before turning lower. The index
closed at 1,102.83 on June 3, the day before slower-than-
estimated U.S. jobs growth sent it to a 3.4 percent tumble.  
 “We’ve identified the 1,105 level as the critical upside
resistance level,” says  Phil Orlando , the New York-based chief
equity market strategist at Federated Investors, which manages
about $400 billion. “The move this morning up to the 1,106
level was the run we were looking for. We’ve hit 1,105, bounced
off and we’ve got to go back.”  
 Benchmark indexes began trimming their advances after
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Greece’s credit rating by
four steps to Ba1, or junk, from A3, citing economic risks. The
S&P 500, the benchmark index for U.S. stocks, has fallen 10
percent from a 19-month high in April amid concern some European
nations will struggle to fund budget deficits.  
 Last Week’s Rally  
 The S&P 500 climbed 2.5 percent last week as China’s
exports jumped the most in six years, Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic recovery is intact and
commodity prices gained.  
 Earlier gains in U.S. stocks followed a rally in European
shares after the region’s  industrial production  grew more than
economists forecast in April, led by demand for intermediate
goods such as steel and car engines. Output in the economy of
the 16 nations using the euro rose 0.8 percent from March, the
European Union said. Economists had projected a gain of 0.5
percent, according to the median in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Stocks Vs. Bonds  
 The decline in global equities since April has left stocks
at the cheapest level relative to bonds since the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a sign that shares in the U.S.
and Europe may rally.  
 “We expect global markets to continue to rally this year,
though at a slower pace than from March last year,” Nomura
Holdings Inc.’s London-based strategist  Ian Scott  wrote in a
report dated June 11. “Equities should continue to derive
support from a number of factors, namely still-attractive
valuations, positive earnings growth and asset allocations that
remain skewed toward cash and continued policy support.”  
 Analysts have lifted their average 2010 earnings growth
forecasts for the S&P 500 to 32 percent from 26 percent at the
end of March even as the benchmark measure of U.S. equities
retreated 13 percent between April 23 and June 4, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Apollo Group , the largest U.S. for-profit university,
declined 6.9 percent to $47.60 for the biggest drop in the S&P
500.  
 Materials Producers  
 Newmont Mining  helped lead  materials producers  to the
biggest drop among 10 industries in the S&P 500. The largest
U.S. gold producer fell 2.3 percent to $54.94. Gold futures for
delivery in August fell $5.70, or 0.5 percent, to $1,224.50 on
the Comex in New York. The price has dropped 2.4 percent from
the all-time high.  
 CF Industries Holdings Inc., the world’s second-largest
producer of nitrogen fertilizer, fell 5 percent to $62.08.
DuPont Co., the third-largest U.S. chemical maker, dropped 2
percent to $36.86.  
 Financial stocks had the second-biggest decline in the S&P
500 among 10 groups as Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home
lender, fell 1.6 percent to $27.40 and  JPMorgan  lost 2 percent
to $37.33 for the biggest decline in the Dow.  
 AIG , recipient of the first and the biggest of U.S. insurer
bailouts, rallied 5.7 percent to $37.09 as  Lincoln National
Corp.  said it plans to repay its rescue funds, sending that
company’s shares up 4 percent to $27.41.  
 Chipmakers Gain  
 SanDisk Corp.  had the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
advancing 6.1 percent to $47.34. The flash-data storage company
is leading its Silicon Valley peers in boosting profit per
employee. It earned $684,381 more from each worker last year
than the prior year, according to Bloomberg data measuring the
most recent fiscal year.  
 Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, rose 1.2
percent to $20.89.  
 BP Plc ’s U.S. traded shares fell 9.7 percent to $30.67.
President  Barack Obama  wants BP to set up an escrow account to
pay the claims for damages caused by its oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico, White House adviser  David Axelrod  said. The company’s
board also today met to discuss its dividend in light of the
leak.  
 Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.  gained 10 percent to
$11.59, the biggest increase in the Russell 1000 Index. The oil
and gas services company said its floating production unit,
Helix Producer I, has been contracted to assist in BP’s oil-
spill response operations.
