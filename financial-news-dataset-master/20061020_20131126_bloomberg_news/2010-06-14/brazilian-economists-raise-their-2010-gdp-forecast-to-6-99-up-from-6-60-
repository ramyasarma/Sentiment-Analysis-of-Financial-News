             Brazilian policy makers in July will
raise their  benchmark interest rate  for a third straight meeting
as the economy this year may expand at the fastest pace in more
than two decades, according to a central bank survey of
economists.  
 Policy makers may raise the Selic to 11 percent at their
July 20-21 meeting after last week’s 0.75 basis-point increase
to 10.25 percent, according to a central bank survey of about
100 economists published today. The rate will end 2010 and 2011
at 11.75 percent, the survey showed.  
 Economists in the survey expect an annual  inflation  rate of
4.76 percent in 12 months time, up from a week-earlier forecast
of 4.72 percent. For year-end 2010, economists see annual
inflation at 5.61 percent, compared to a forecast of 5.64
percent in last week’s survey.  
 Brazil’s  economy  will expand 6.99 percent this year, up
from a week-earlier forecast 6.6 percent, the survey showed.  
 Latin America’s biggest economy expanded 9 percent in the
first quarter of this year, compared with the same period a year
earlier, the national statistics agency said last week.
Inflation may slow in coming months as a food price shock
abates, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV on June 11.  
 The real rose 0.9 percent to 1.7951 per dollar at 8:15 a.m.
New York time, from 1.8107 on June 11.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
the contract due in January 2012, the most traded on Sao Paulo’s
BM&F exchange, rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 12.19 percent.
