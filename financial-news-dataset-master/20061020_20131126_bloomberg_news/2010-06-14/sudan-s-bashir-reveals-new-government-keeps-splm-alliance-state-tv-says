             Sudanese President  Umar al-Bashir 
revealed a new government almost two months after the first
multiparty elections in 24 years returned him to office, Sudan’s
state-run Sudan TV channel said today.  
 The government, like the pre-election administration, is a
coalition between Bashir’s National Congress Party and the  Sudan
People’s Liberation Movement , which governs  Southern Sudan . The
two parties have been in an alliance since they signed a  peace
agreement  in 2005 ending a 21-year civil war between the
northern and southern regions.  
 Bashir’s vice presidents remain SPLM leader  Salva Kiir  and
 Ali Osman Taha . The minister of finance is Ali Mahmoud Abdel
Rasool of the NCP, while the minister of oil is Lual Ashweil
Deng of the SPLM.  
 Semi-autonomous Southern Sudan is due to hold a referendum
on independence in January.  
 International observers including the European Union and
the Atlanta-based Carter Center said the April 11-15 elections
failed to reach international standards in both the northern and
southern regions.  
 Sudan is sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest oil producer,
producing about 490,000 barrels of crude a day, according to the
 BP Statistical Review of World Energy .
