             Societe Generale SA and  BNP Paribas 
SA are among banks considering a bid for  Allied Irish Banks
Plc ’s stake in  Bank Zachodni WBK SA  of Poland valued at about $3
billion, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Poland’s PKO Bank Polski SA and OAO  Sberbank of Russia  are
also interested in making an offer for the 70 percent stake,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
matter is private. Indicative offers are due later this month
and at least two private-equity firms are also interested in
making bids, another person said.  
 Bank Zachodni, based in Warsaw, has a market value of 14.6
billion zloty ($4.4 billion). The international banks may be
seeking to increase exposure to  Poland ’s economy, which was the
only European Union nation to avoid a recession last year. The
economy may expand 3 percent in 2010, according to a government
forecast.  
 Dublin-based Allied Irish said in March it plans to sell
stakes in banks in the U.S. and Poland to help meet its bank
regulator’s requirement to raise 7.4 billion euros ($9 billion)
of capital. Proceeds from the disposal of businesses in the
U.S., Poland and the U.K. are expected to meet a “substantial
part” of the capital needs, Allied Irish Chairman Dan O’Connor
said April 28.  
 Spokeswomen at Societe Generale and BNP declined to
comment. Allied Irish spokesman Ronan Sheridan declined to
comment, as did Sergei Rachkovsky, a spokesman for Sberbank in
Moscow. Bank Zachodni spokesman Piotr Gajdzinski declined to
comment.  
 SocGen CEO  
   Societe Generale  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Frederic Oudea said earlier today the price of Bank Zachodni
seems “too high.” Oudea was speaking to reporters ahead of a
presentation to investors in Paris. Bank Zachodni’s shares have
more than doubled in the past 12 months.  
 PKO Bank Polski’s “strategy for 2010 to 2012 is based on
organic growth,” Chief Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello said
in an e-mail when asked about a possible bid. Still, “no
potential acquisition that could lead to an increase of the
bank’s assets or its market position should be excluded.”  
 Polish law requires an investor that buys more than 66
percent of a publicly traded company to bid for the rest of the
shares.  
 Allied Irish is among lenders transferring loans at a
discount to the country’s National Asset Management Agency.
Ireland’s banking system began unraveling two years ago after
the economy entered a recession and the real-estate market
collapsed.
