             Posco  may this week tentatively
agree to a price increase of 25 percent to 30 percent for iron
ore for the third quarter, the Korea Economic Daily reported
today, without citing anyone.  
 Iron ore prices may climb to about $135 a metric ton, from
$105 a ton, the Korean-language newspaper reported. Coking coal
prices are likely to rise about 10 percent to 15 percent, the
report said.  
 Posco spokesman  Choi Doo Jin  couldn’t immediately be
reached on his mobile phone for a comment.
