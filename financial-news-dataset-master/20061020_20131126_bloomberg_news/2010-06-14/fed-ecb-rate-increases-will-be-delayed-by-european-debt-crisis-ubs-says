             UBS AG pushed back forecasts for
interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve and European
Central Bank because of the European debt crisis.  
 The U.S.  target rate  for overnight loans between banks will
increase in January, rather than in September, UBS said in a
research note today. The ECB will tighten in the second quarter
of 2011, instead of the first quarter, the firm said.  
 The Fed funds target will climb to 1.5 percent by the end
of 2011,  Geoffrey Yu , a London-based strategist, wrote in the
research note.  
 “The rationale is that looser monetary policy will be
needed to offset the effects of fiscal tightening” in Europe,
Yu wrote.  
 The Fed lowered its target rate to a record low range of
zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 amid the worst recession
since the 1930s. The ECB lowered its rate to an all-time low of
1 percent in May 2009.
