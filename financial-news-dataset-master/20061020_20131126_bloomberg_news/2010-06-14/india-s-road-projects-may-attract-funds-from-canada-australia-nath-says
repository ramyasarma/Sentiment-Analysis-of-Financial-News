             India, Asia’s third-biggest economy,
may attract funding for  road projects  from Canadian and
Australian investors, Road Transport and Highways Minister  Kamal Nath  said in an interview to Bloomberg-UTV.  
 Investors in Canada and developers in Australia were
considering Indian infrastructure and road projects “because
they are finding this is a good vehicle of investment,” Nath
said today, without providing any further details. The minister
last week said he met with Temasek Holdings Pte to discuss the
“idea” of setting up a fund to invest in roads, ports and
airports as the country seeks to improve infrastructure.  
 Roads , used to transport 65 percent of India’s freight, are
plagued by single lanes and irregular surfaces that slow trucks
to an average speed of about 20 kilometers (12 miles) per hour,
according to a 2009 study by the Indian Institute of Management
Calcutta and Transport Corp. of India Ltd.  
 Nath has set a target of building 20 kilometers of highways
a day through 2015 as the government tries to ease congestion
and accelerate economic growth.  
 India will need to  borrow  100 billion rupees to 200 billion
rupees annually from domestic and global markets for the next 15
years to fund the road building projects, the National Highway
Authority said last month.
