             Japan wants to establish a
comprehensive exchange for securities and commodities by fiscal
2013 to increase market clout and attract foreign investment,
Nikkei English News reported, without saying where it got the
information.   
 The Financial Services Agency, the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry, Agriculture Ministry and other agencies will
create a committee to discuss regulations and supervisory roles
now handled by separate authorities, Nikkei said. The new
exchange would handle financial products, including stocks and
interest-rate futures, as well as commodities futures, Nikkei
reported.
