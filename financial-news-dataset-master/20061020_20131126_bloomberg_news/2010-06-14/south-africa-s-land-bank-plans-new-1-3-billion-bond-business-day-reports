             South Africa’s Land Bank plans to 
register a 10 billion-rand ($1.3 billion) local bond program 
and intends to redeem a 2.2 billion-rand bond “soon,” 
Business Day reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Phakamani
Hadebe.  
 The lender has already bought back 1 billion rand of the 
bond paying 14 percent interest and will redeem the rest this 
month, Hadebe told the Johannesburg-based newspaper. 
Investigators are continuing their forensic inquiry into 
transactions worth 700 million rand, according to the newspaper.
