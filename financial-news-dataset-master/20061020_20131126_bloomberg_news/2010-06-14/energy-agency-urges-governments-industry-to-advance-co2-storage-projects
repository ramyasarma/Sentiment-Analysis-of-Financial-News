             Governments and industry should
boost efforts to deploy carbon capture and storage projects that
reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas and help fight global
warming, the International Energy Agency said in a report.  
 The Group of Eight’s goal of implementing 20 large-scale
CCS demonstration projects by 2010 “remains a challenge,” IEA
said in the  report , which will be presented to G-8 leaders at
their summit in Canada later this month.  
 Some 80 projects to capture carbon dioxide and bury it
underground are being developed around the world, according to a
study commissioned by the Global CCS Institute and integrated
into the IEA report.  
 “The growing number of projects under development around
the world demonstrates that increased action is being taken,”
Nick Otter, chief executive officer for the institute, was
quoted as saying in an IEA statement e-mailed today. “Rapid
progress towards operation of those projects is now required if
CCS is to be on track for broad deployment by 2020.”
