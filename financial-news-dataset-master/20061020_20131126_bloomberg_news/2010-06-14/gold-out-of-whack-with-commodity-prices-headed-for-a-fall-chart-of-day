             Gold is “way out of whack with
commodity prices” and headed for a fall, according to  Brian Belski , Oppenheimer & Co.’s chief investment strategist.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY displays the ratio between gold’s
price for immediate delivery, determined in the so-called spot
market, and the  Commodity Research Bureau ’s spot commodity index
on a monthly basis. The latter consists mainly of scrap metals,
textiles, livestock and farm products.  
 This month’s reading of 2.93 is the second highest since
1981, as shown in the chart. The highest was 3.03 in February
2009, when spot gold ended a four-month advance by trading at
more than $1,000 an ounce.  
 Gold dropped as much as 13 percent in the next two months
before rebounding to records. The precious metal’s price peaked
on June 8 at $1,252.11 an ounce, a 45 percent increase from its
April 2009 low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Momentum and misguided fear appear to be behind gold’s
rise,” Belski wrote today in a report that featured a similar
chart. “Therefore, we do not expect the gold trade to end
well.”  
 After taking inflation into account, the metal is more
costly than at any other time since the early 1980s, he wrote.
Spot gold tumbled 48 percent between 1981 and 1984. A similarly
“sharp and severe” drop is likely to follow the current rally,
the report said.
