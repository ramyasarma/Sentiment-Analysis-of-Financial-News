             Zenyatta secured her 17th straight
victory in thoroughbred racing at the Vanity Handicap.  
 The win for the 1-5 favorite, by half a length, in the
$250,000 race at  Hollywood Park  in Inglewood, California, took
Zenyatta past the 16 consecutive wins achieved by Triple Crown
winner Citation and two-time Horse of the Year Cigar.  
 Zenyatta, a 6-year-old mare who beat a field of male
horses last year in the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic,
covered the 1 1/8 miles on the artificial Hollywood Park track
in 1 minute, 49.01 seconds.  
 “She’s sort of in a class by herself,” owner  Jerry Moss 
said after yesterday’s win. “It’s an awesome gift to have a
horse like this.”  
 St Trinians was second and Zardana was third in the race.
Zardana is Zenyatta’s stablemate and beat reigning Horse of the
Year Rachel Alexandra in the New Orleans Ladies Stakes at Fair
Grounds on March 13.  
 Zenyatta and Rachel Alexandra have yet to meet on the race
track. Rachel Alexandra’s owner,  Jess Jackson , declined to enter
the filly in the Breeders’ Cup last year because it was run on
an artificial surface at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia,
California.  
 Jackson has alluded to the possibility that Rachel
Alexandra, winner of the 2009 Preakness Stakes, will run in this
year’s Breeders’ Cup on the dirt track at Churchill Downs.  
 Rachel Alexandra won her first race as a 4-year-old by 10
1/2 lengths in the $214,000 Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill
Downs two days ago.  
 Last year, Zenyatta was the top-earning North American
thoroughbred at $3.3 million and won honors as the 2009 champion
older filly or mare.  
 Citation won 16 consecutive races through 1950 and Mister
Frisky matched the feat in 1990. Cigar joined the list in 1996
and Louisiana-bred Hallowed Dreams also reached the mark in
2000. Peppers Pride won her 16th race in 2008 at the age of five
and entered North American thoroughbred racing’s record books on
Oct. 4 of that year when she claimed her 17th win. The mare’s
last race and 19th win was on Dec. 14, 2008.
