             Canada’s dollar fell from the
highest level this month as a downgrade of Greece rekindled
concern that the global economic recovery will stall.  
 The loonie, as the currency is sometimes known, rose 3
percent last week, the most in eight months, on speculation
economic growth will fuel demand for the nation’s raw materials.
Moody’s Investors Service lowered Greece’s credit rating to
junk, increasing investors’ risk aversion.  
 “The downgrade of Greece was a catalyst,”  Shaun Osborne ,
chief currency strategist at TD Securities Inc., a unit of
Canada’s second-largest bank, said by phone from Toronto. “We
generally think that the Canadian dollar is going to struggle to
do much better than C$1.02 or C$1.03 because a lot of the good
news is priced in.”  
 The currency traded at C$1.0333 at 4:36 p.m. in Toronto,
after gaining as much as 0.9 percent to C$1.0225 per U.S.
dollar, the strongest level since May 14, from C$1.0322 on June
11. One Canadian dollar buys 96.78 U.S. cents.  
 The loonie was the third-worst performer among the
greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts after Moody’s reduced
Greece’s credit rating to Ba1 from A3. Standard & Poor’s already
rated the debt as junk.  
 The loonie earlier rose as the  MSCI World Index , a gauge of
equities in 23 developed nations, climbed 1 percent. Crude oil
for July delivery rose as much as 3 percent to $75.99 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 10-Year Yield  
 The  yield  on Canada’s 10-year bond rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage points, to 3.44 percent, after touching 3.47
percent, the highest level since May 18. The 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 fell 34 cents to C$100.47.  
 Canada’s government bonds have lost investors 0.5 percent
this month, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
Government bonds returned 1.9 percent in May on concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will slow the global economic recovery.  
 Futures traders boosted  bets  on gains in the Canadian
dollar versus the U.S. dollar, figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the
number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on a
Canadian dollar advance compared with those on a drop -- so-
called net longs -- was 22,510 on June 8, compared with net
longs of 22,154 a week earlier.  
 “Speculators are unwilling to increase bets against a
currency that remains so fundamentally sound,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a
strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-
largest bank, wrote in a note to clients.
