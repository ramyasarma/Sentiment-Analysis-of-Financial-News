              Morgan Stanley raised its growth
outlook for Brazil’s economy this year after the government
reported stronger than expected first quarter growth.  
 Morgan Stanley expects Latin America’s biggest economy to
expand 7.9 percent this year compared with a previous forecast
of 6.8 percent, Marcelo Carvalho, Morgan Stanley’s chief
economist in Sao Paulo, wrote in an emailed report today.  
 “The math changes, although our view ahead does not:
Brazil’s economy is booming,” Carvalho wrote.  
 Brazil’s economy is growing at a Chinese-like pace, with
the labor market tight and little spare capacity, according to
the report.
