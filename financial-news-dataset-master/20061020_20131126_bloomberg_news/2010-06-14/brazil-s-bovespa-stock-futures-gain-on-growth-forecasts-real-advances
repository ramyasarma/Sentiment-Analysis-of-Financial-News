             Most Brazilian stocks rose as higher
commodity prices and increased growth estimates by economists
offset a drop in  Petroleo Brasileiro SA .  
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes ,
Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, and  Lojas Americanas
SA , the largest discount retailer, gained more than 2 percent on
the outlook for a faster expansion. The Bovespa index’s gain was
limited as  Petrobras,  the state-controlled oil company, dropped
1.9 percent on speculation its share sale may be larger than $25
billion.  
 “The big picture for Brazil that people bought into last
year is not going to change,” said  Greg Lesko , who helps manage
$800 million at Deltec Asset Management in New York. “Flows are
still coming in, and people want to hold Brazil in their
emerging markets portfolio.”  
 The  Bovespa  slipped 0.1 percent to 63,532.85. Thirty-six
stocks rose, while 26 fell. The measure climbed 3.1 percent last
week after economic reports from China bolstered the global
growth outlook and Itau Unibanco Holding SA advised buying the
nation’s stocks. The real was little changed at 1.8109 per
dollar.  
 Petrobras fell to 29.05 reais. The company, which hasn’t
announced how much money it will raise in its share sale, may
have an offering of as much as $30 billion, while the government
trades 5 billion barrels of oil reserves for another $30
billion, said  Ricardo Vitorino , a trader with Spinelli Corretora
SA in Sao Paulo. Petrobras said on May 18 that demand for the
share offer may reach $25 billion.  
 ‘Losing Power’  
 “Minority stockholders are concerned about losing power,”
Vitorino said. “They don’t have so much money, so they would
have to sell other stocks to get a new position that is
proportionally the same.”  
 The company expects to conclude the offering by the end of
July.  
 Oil and copper prices rose as a weaker dollar spurred
demand for commodities as an alternative investment and on
speculation growth in the U.S. will spur consumption. The
Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index climbed 2.9
percent. Gerdau SA, Latin America’s biggest steelmaker, advanced
0.5 percent to 25.13 reais.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , Brazil’s second-biggest steelmaker, gained 1.1 percent to
46.50 reais.  
 Growth Forecasts  
 Brazil’s economy will expand 6.99 percent this year,
compared with a week-earlier forecast of 6.6 percent, according
to the median forecast in a June 11 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today.  
 Cyrela gained 3.6 percent to 20.80 reais. Lojas Americanas
increased 2.1 percent to 13.30 reais.  
 The Bovespa has dropped 12 percent from its 2010 high on
April 8 on concern sovereign debt problems in Europe and higher
borrowing costs will curb growth.  
 Industrial output in the 16 nations using the euro
increased 0.8 percent in April from the prior month, the
European Union’s statistics office said. Economists had
projected a gain of 0.5 percent, the median of 33 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. From the year-earlier month, April production
jumped 9.5 percent, the biggest gain since the data were first
compiled in 1991.  
 In the interest-rate futures market, traders increased bets
for higher borrowing costs, sending the yield on contracts due
in January 2011 up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 11.16 percent.  
 Telefonica Bid  
 Vivo Participacoes SA, Brazil’s biggest mobile-phone
company, fell 2 percent to 52.70 reais. Portugal Telecom SGPS SA
investor Ongoing Strategy Investments SGPS SA plans to vote
against selling the company’s stake in a Brazilian joint venture
at a shareholder meeting this month.  
 Portugal Telecom is asking investors to vote June 30 on an
increased 6.5 billion-euro ($8 billion) bid from Telefonica for
its stake in their venture, which controls Vivo. Ongoing is
Portugal Telecom’s fourth-biggest investor, with a 6.8 percent
stake.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.1 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.8 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.4
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.7 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
