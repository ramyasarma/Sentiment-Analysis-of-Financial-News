             Companies including TitleMax
Holdings LLC are marketing $4.9 billion of dollar-denominated
bonds in the U.S., as debt sales continue to falter on investor
concern that lawmakers and central bankers can’t tame Europe’s
fiscal crisis.  
 TitleMax, the automobile title lending company, is
marketing a $225 million sale of five-year notes through June
17, according to a person familiar with the offer, who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t set. Companies sold $9.04
billion of debt in the U.S. from June 7 through June 11, as
issuance trailed the year’s weekly average of $20.3 billion for
a seventh consecutive time.  
 Sales have slowed as investors lose confidence that
European leaders can contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis,
and reports point to a slower economic recovery than previously
anticipated. European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said
last week a 750 billion euro ($907 billion) rescue package will
be increased if it fails to quell volatility, a day before a
report showed sales at U.S. retailers dropped in May for the
first time in eight months.  
 “The tone of the market remains cautious and is likely to
remain defensive until the market feels comfortable that a
comprehensive strategy is in place for Europe,” said  Rajeev Sharma , a money manager who oversees $1.4 billion of investment-
grade debt at First Investors Management Co. in New York.  
 Issuance for the week ended June 4 was $8.05 billion,
Bloomberg data show. May was the slowest month of U.S. corporate
bond sales since October 2008, when credit markets froze in the
aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  
 Bond Spreads  
 The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of Treasuries was unchanged at 213 basis points on
June 11, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Corporate Master index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Debt sales may pick up as bonds are traded more actively in
the secondary market, offering borrowers and syndicate members
“some sense of transparency,” said  Justin D’Ercole , head of
investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Barclays Capital.  
 “Week over week, we’re noticing a meaningful improvement
in sentiment in the market,” D’Ercole said.  
 Deere & Co ., the world’s largest farm equipment maker, and
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp . both boosted the size of their
debt offerings by at least $150 million last week, suggesting
investor demand for the bonds, according to people familiar with
the transactions, who declined to be identified because terms
weren’t yet public.  
 High-Yield Spreads  
 Spreads on high-yield debt widened 8 basis points to 727
basis points on June 11, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s U.S. High Yield Master II index. That’s 185 basis points
from the year’s low of 542 basis points on April 26.  
 Company debt sales remain “in the pipeline,” said  Lon Erickson , a managing director at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based
Thornburg Investment Management.  
 “If the market can get comfortable that at least for a
little while, it’ll be steady without any more big shocks to the
system, then we can probably start to see a steady stream of new
issuance,” said  Erickson , who oversees about $9 billion in
fixed-income assets. “People are still a little bit reluctant
to come and have a deal price badly and perform badly.”  
 Following is a description of the $4.9 billion pending
sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S.
