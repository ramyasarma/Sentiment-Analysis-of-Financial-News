             Oando Plc, a Nigerian oil company,
is in talks to acquire between 1 billion barrels and 4 billion
barrels in oil-equivalent resources in Nigeria, Chief Executive
Officer Wale Tinubu said.  
 The “ball-park value” of the resources may be $2 billion,
Tinubu told reporters in Johannesburg today. The company is in
talks with oil majors operating in Nigeria, he said.  
 Oando could also spin off its downstream unit by the end of
September, Tinubu said.
