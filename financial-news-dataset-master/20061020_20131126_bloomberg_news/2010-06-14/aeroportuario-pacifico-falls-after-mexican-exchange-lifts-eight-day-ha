             Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB 
fell the most in three weeks after the Mexican stock exchange
lifted an eight-day trading suspension on the airport operator.  
 Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico dropped as much as 6.7
percent, the steepest intraday retreat since May 25, to 41.10
pesos and slid 3.3 percent to 42.60 pesos at 12:01 p.m. New York
time. The shares closed at 44.07 pesos June 1 before the
suspension and have gained 4.9 percent in 2010.  
 Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, the operator of Mexico’s
stock exchange, said it lifted the suspension after the company
met a requirement for reporting information. The exchange
suspended trading of Aeroportuario del Pacifico shares June 2
after receiving orders from the National Banking and Securities
Commission.  
 Aeroportuario del Pacifico operates airports in 12 Mexican
cities, including Guadalajara, Tijuana and Puerto Vallarta.
