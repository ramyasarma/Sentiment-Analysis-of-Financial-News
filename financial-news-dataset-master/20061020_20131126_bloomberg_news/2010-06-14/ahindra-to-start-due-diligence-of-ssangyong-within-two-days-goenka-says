             Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , India’s
biggest sport-utility vehicle maker, will begin carrying out due
diligence on  Ssangyong Motor Co.  within the next two days, as
the automaker aims to expand overseas.  
 A bid will depend on the findings of the inspection into
Ssangyong, Mahindra & Mahindra President  Pawan Goenka  said in
Pune, western India today.  
 Pyeongtaek, South Korea-based Ssangyong, which entered
bankruptcy protection in February 2009, offers buyers access to
Asian and Russian markets, sale advisers Samjong KPMG Advisory
Inc. and Macquarie Group Inc. said in a document sent to
investors. Ssangyong said May 28 that seven parties expressed
interest in a controlling stake, reported by MoneyToday to be
worth at least 700 billion won ($573 million).  
 Ssangyong may be a “good fit” for Mahindra as the South
Korean company would give access to new markets, Goenka said on
May 29.  
 Mahindra  gained as much as 1.6 percent to 616.3 rupees in
Mumbai and changed hands at 608.75 rupees at 1:33 p.m. The
shares have gained 12 percent this year compared with a 1.7
percent decline for the benchmark  Sensex index .  
 A group led by  Nissan Motor Co.  that includes partner
Renault SA expressed interest in buying a controlling stake in
Ssangyong,  Andrew Palmer , a senior vice president at Nissan,
said on June 1. Renault is the largest shareholder of Nissan and
holds an 80 percent stake in South Korea’s Renault Samsung
Motors Co. unit.
