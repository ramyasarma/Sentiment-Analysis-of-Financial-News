             Argentine grain and soybean quality
inspectors, who are seeking a 48 percent salary increase,
suspended a strike scheduled to start today until Wednesday amid
further pay talks, a union leader said.  
 “We are meeting with employers tomorrow and if we don’t
settle we will see how we can suspend our activities,” union
official Pablo Palacio said today in a telephone interview from
the Argentine city of Bahia Blanca. “We expect the government
to order a 15-day truce, though.”  
 The union, known as URGARA, is seeking 6,000 pesos ($1,529)
a month while employers are offering to increase wages to 4,800
pesos, the union said last week. The current base salary is
4,063.46, according to the   union’s website .  
 Argentina is the world’s third-largest exporter and producer
of soybeans and the second-largest exporter of corn, according
to Bloomberg data. The largest exporters in Argentina are
Cargill Inc. and Bunge Ltd.
