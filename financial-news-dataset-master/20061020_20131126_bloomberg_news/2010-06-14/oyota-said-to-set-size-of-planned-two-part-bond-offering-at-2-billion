             Toyota Motor Corp. set the size of
its planned two-part bond offering at $2 billion, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  
 The world’s largest automaker may sell $1.25 billion of
five-year notes at 120 basis points more than similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set. Toyota also plans to sell $750 million
of 10-year notes at a spread of 130 basis points, the person
said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
