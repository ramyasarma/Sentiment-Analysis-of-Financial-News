             Japanese companies will likely boost
dividends as earnings increase free cash flow and liquid assets,
according to UBS AG.  
 “Companies have unprecedented amounts of cash, and are
likely to increase shareholder returns beyond market
forecasts,”  Shoji Hirakawa , chief equity strategist at UBS in
Tokyo, wrote in a report dated June 11.  
 Hirakawa, who estimates gains of 50 percent in pre-tax
profit and 10 percent in capital spending in fiscal 2010, said
dividends will jump as much as 30 percent to an aggregate 4.5
trillion yen ($49 billion) this year. The projection, based on
data from 952 non-financial companies listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange’s first section, exceeds corporate forecasts for an
average 14 percent increase, according to the report.  
 UBS is focusing on  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. , NTT DoCoMo
Inc., Mitsui & Co., Kansai Electric Power Co., Osaka Gas Co.,
Alps Electric Co. and Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. among the
shares it rates as “buy,” the report said.
