             Italy’s FTSE MIB Index gained the
most in more than two weeks, rising 528.27, or 2.7 percent, to
20,188.54 in Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Assicurazioni Generali SpA  (G IM) rose 50 cents, or 3.4
percent, to 15.08 euros, the highest in more than two weeks.
French entrepreneur  Vincent Bollore , vice chairman of Generali,
may lift his stake in the insurer to as much as 2 percent,
Italian newspaper  La Repubblica  reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  
 Separately, Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, a deputy
chairman of Generali, bought additional stock shares for 3.5
million euros on June 9-10, according to a regulatory filing.  
 Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM), Italy’s largest independent
fund manager, gained 26 cents, or 3.6 percent, to 7.41 euros as
European stocks rose for a fourth day.  
 Cell Therapeutics Inc.  (CTIC IM) surged 10.1 cents, or 33
percent, to 41.1 cents, the highest in more than a month, as the
authority responsible for drug regulation in Italy approved the
facility for the production of CTI’s drug candidate pixantrone.  
 Eni SpA  (ENI IM) rose 38 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 15.75
euros, a fourth straight gain. Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts
raised their recommendation on European oil shares to
“bullish” from “neutral,” saying a decline in the past two
months has left the industry attractively priced.  
 The brokerage kept a “buy” rating on Italy’s biggest oil
company, while trimming its price estimate to 20.8 euros from
22.3 euros.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) climbed 29.5 cents, or 3.3 percent, to 9.23
euros, the highest in about a month. The Italian carmaker won a
partial agreement from unions on its requests for increased
shifts to boost production at its Pomigliano d’Arco plant near
Naples.  
 Fondiara-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) surged 35 cents, or 4.3 percent,
to 8.43 euros. Gruppo Banca Leonardo said in a note that the
strategy to exit property developer CityLife “may lead to a
disposal value above the current consolidated book value of the
stake.”  
 Separately, the insurer sold 83 million euros of Lehman
Brothers bonds to an unidentified hedge fund in the U.S.,
realizing a gain of 23 million euros, a Fondiaria spokeswoman
said on June 11.  
 Gruppo Coin SpA  (GCN IM) advanced 24 cents, or 4.5 percent,
to 5.6 euros, the highest in more than eight weeks. Deutsche
Bank AG reiterated a “buy” rating on Italy’s largest clothing
distributor, citing “slightly better-than-expected first-
quarter results.”  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM), Italy’s second-biggest bank,
rose 6.3 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 2.24 euros. Centrobanca said
in a note that the “Italian banking sector is one of the best
positioned in Europe if we consider the whole framework of the
new rules,” regarding capital, liquidity, leverage, market and
risk.  
 Pirelli & C. SpA  (PC IM) gained 2.05 cents, or 4.3 percent,
to 49.25 cents, a fourth session of gains. HSBC Holdings Plc
initiated coverage of Europe’s third-largest tiremaker with an
“overweight” recommendation and a price estimate of 55 cents.  
 The brokerage cited “surprise potential from Latin
America,” while the spinoff of  Pirelli & C. Real Estate SpA 
(PRS IM) “offers potential re-rating.” Pirelli Re shares
advanced 1.8 cents, or 4.9 percent, to 38.75 cents.  
 Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, gained 44 cents, or 3.5 percent, to 13.15 euros, a fourth
consecutive increase as metal prices advanced on signs of
sustained demand in China after domestic inventories fell for a
sixth week.  
 Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of seamless
steel tubes for oil and gas extraction, advanced 52 cents, or
3.5 percent, to 15.54 euros. Oil and natural-gas rigs operating

Texas exceeded declines in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM), Italy’s biggest bank, increased 9
cents, or 5.1 percent, to 1.84 euros, the highest in almost four
weeks. Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Profumo said the slide
in the euro against the dollar won’t have an impact on the
bank’s earnings.  
 Profumo also said that European governments are taking the
right actions in cutting deficits. Profumo’s comments in Milan
today, earlier reported by Ansa and Radiocor, were confirmed by
a company official.
