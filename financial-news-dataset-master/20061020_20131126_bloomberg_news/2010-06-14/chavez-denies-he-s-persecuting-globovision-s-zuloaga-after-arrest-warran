             Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
denied that he’s persecuting  Guillermo Zuloaga , a businessman
who’s owner of opposition television network Globovision,
after the Attorney General issued an arrest warrant for him
on June 11.  
 Chavez, speaking on state television, said that Zuloaga
has his rights guaranteed by Venezuelan law and is presumed
innocent until proven guilty.  
 Zuloaga, who has failed to turn himself into Venezuelan
authorities, is wanted along with his son on charges of usury
after 24 new vehicles were found at his residence in Caracas
last year, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Attorney General’s Office.
