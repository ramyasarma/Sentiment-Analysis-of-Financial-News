             The euro’s gain to a one-week high
versus the dollar may be a “false friend” setting the currency
up for a drop to $1.1875 if it doesn’t rally further, according
to UniCredit SpA.  
 Its increase from a four-year low of $1.1877 reached June 7
may be a “fragile pullback” if it doesn’t break above $1.2290,
a level that provides a test of the rebound’s momentum,
UniCredit analysts led by  Roberto Mialich  in Milan wrote today
in a research note.  
 The euro gained 1 percent to $1.2229 at 12:13 p.m. in
London, after earlier rising to $1.2259, the highest level since
June 3. Europe’s currency gained 1.2 percent to 112.28 yen after
touching 112.67, the highest since June 4. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index rose for a fourth day, advancing 0.9 percent.  
 “We’re skeptical about this rebound,” Mialich said in an
interview. “The bounce in equity markets created a positive
sentiment, which is reducing the selling pressure on the euro.
But the underlying weaknesses remain.”  
 The euro’s advance today pared this year’s drop to 15
percent versus the dollar and 16 percent against the yen. The
European currency’s move in the past week, according to
UniCredit, is similar to an increase last month, when the euro
rallied from about $1.22 on May 18 to $1.2672 on May 21, only to
decline to the four-year low earlier this month.  
 “The euro pullback may be a false friend,” the analysts
wrote. “This is more likely to offer some near-term
consolidation rather than a thorough change in sentiment.”  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast price changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
