             Asia-Pacific corporate defaults will
“drop sharply” in 2010 as the region’s economy and credit
markets strengthen, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The speculative-grade default rate for non-financial
companies in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, will
plunge to about 3.5 percent this year, from 17 percent in 2009,
 Clara Lau , a Moody’s analyst, she said in a statement from the
New York-based rating company today.  
 “The sharp expected decline in the default rate for Asia
Pacific reflects the significantly better credit market
environment and progressively improving economic conditions in
the region,” Lau said.  
 The rate of corporate failures globally is forecast to fall
to 2.4 percent by the end of the year from 13 percent at the end
of 2009. The scenario is based on the assumption of continued
economic recovery and relatively stable credit spreads
throughout the rest of the year, Lau said.  
 “Further contributing to the lower default rate is the
overall increased accessibility by the region’s speculative-
grade companies to the bank and capital markets,” Lau said.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own Asian dollar-
denominated high-yield corporate bonds rather than government
debt tightened to 792 basis points from a six-month high of 800
basis points on June 7, according to Bank of America Corp.
indexes. A basis point is 0.01 percentage points.  
 High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.
