             Questar Corp.,  the Salt Lake City-
based utility owner, scheduled the spinoff of its oil and
natural-gas exploration and production unit for June 30.  
 Shareholders as of the close of business June 18 will get
one share of QEP Resources Inc. for each share of Questar they
own, the company said in a statement today. QEP Resources will
include Questar businesses that accounted for 54 percent of 2009
net income, according to company filings.  
 QEP Resources will be based in Denver and will own gas-
processing and energy-trading subsidiaries, in addition to the
exploration and production unit.  
 Questar will remain based in Salt Lake City, comprised of
three subsidiaries including Questar Gas, a regulated utility
that serves about 900,000 homes and businesses in Utah, Wyoming
and Idaho. It will own a pipeline unit and Wexpro, a gas-
production unit that supplies the utility.  
 Questar rose 3 cents to $47.83 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. It has gained 4.3 percent since
announcing plans for the spinoff.
