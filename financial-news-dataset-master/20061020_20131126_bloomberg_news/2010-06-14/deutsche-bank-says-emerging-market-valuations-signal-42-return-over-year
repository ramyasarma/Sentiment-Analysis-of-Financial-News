             Investors buying emerging-market
stocks at current valuations may reap gains of as much as 42
percent over the next 12 months, according to Deutsche Bank AG,
citing historical returns.  
 Emerging-market  shares  are trading at about 9.9 times
estimated earnings, compared with their average</a> of about 12.1
times, Hong Kong-based strategist  Brad Jones  said. On an equity
risk premium basis that takes into account the “unusually low
level of real U.S. interest rates,” developing nations are also
1.1 standard deviations cheaper, he also said.  
 At these levels, developing-nation stocks have historically
yielded returns of between 19 percent and 42 percent, according
to Deutsche Bank. Valuations have shrunk this year as the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  dropped 6.6 percent, giving up some of
last year’s record 75 percent rally, as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis spreads and concerns that China’s efforts to curb
speculation in its real estate market will cool the nation’s
economic growth.  
 Emerging markets are “converging toward, but not quite at,
a valuation floor,” Jones wrote in a June 11 report. “Though
valuations are still shy of a ‘boundary condition’ low, Asia
excluding Japan and emerging-market stocks have been cheaper
than today on just 10 to 20 percent of months since 1995.”  
 Current multiples for developing nations are at least
as low as those of 1998, the strategist said. That’s when
the Asian financial crisis drove the region’s economies into
recession and Russia defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.  
 ‘Negligible’ Inflows  
 The “negligible” inflows to emerging-market stocks and
the worst monthly performance for developing-nation hedge funds
in May since September and October of 2008 also suggest signs of
“distress” within the markets, according to Jones.  
 Emerging-market stock funds posted a second straight week
of inflows in the week ended June 9, taking year-to-date
investments to $11.9 billion, according to EPFR Global. That
compares with record inflows of about $83 billion last year.  
 Within  Asia markets  outside of Japan, valuations have
become 1 standard deviation cheaper than its historical average,
after having been 1.5 standard deviations more expensive last
July, according to the strategist. At these levels, markets have
posted average one-year returns of between 9 percent and 36
percent, he said.
