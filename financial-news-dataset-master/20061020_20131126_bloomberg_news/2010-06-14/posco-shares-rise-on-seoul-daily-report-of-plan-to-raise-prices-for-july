             Posco  rose to the highest in five
weeks in Seoul trading after the Seoul Economic Daily reported
South Korea’s largest mill plans to raise July product prices.  
 The stock  advanced as much as 2.8 percent to 478,500 won,
the highest level since May 11, and traded at 476,500 won as of
9:52 a.m. on the Korea Exchange. The benchmark  Kospi  stock index
was up 1.1 percent.  
 Major South Korean steelmakers including Posco are weighing
increases of as much as 20 percent, the Seoul Economic Daily
reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information.
Steelmakers are under pressure from rising raw material costs,
with coking coal prices up 12.5 percent in the July quarter.  
 Posco, Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker, isn’t considering
a price “adjustment” now and is studying the market, Choi Doo
Jin, a spokesman for the Pohang-based company, said by phone
today in response to the report. The Korean-language newspaper
said a price gain may be announced as early as June 21.  
 Posco raised domestic steel prices by as much as 25 percent
in May, taking advantage of strong demand from makers of cars
and appliances to pass on higher raw material costs.  
 Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, the biggest
iron ore exporters, may demand a 30 percent price increase for
the July quarter from the previous three months, China Steel
Corp. said last month.
