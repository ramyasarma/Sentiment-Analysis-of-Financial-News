             Most  Canadian stocks  rose for a
third day, led by banks, after the European Union reported a
bigger increase in industrial production than most economists
forecast.  
 Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest bank, gained
1.4 percent after Canada said new-vehicle sales dropped less
than the median economist estimate in April. Goldcorp Inc.,
Canada’s  second-largest gold producer , fell 2.9 percent as
futures on the metal declined as the euro rose. TransCanada
Corp., owner of Canada’s largest pipeline system, advanced 1
percent as natural gas climbed to a 16-week high.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 0.42
point to 11,667.34. Among S&P/TSX stocks, 125 gained, 94
declined and 2 were unchanged.  
 “The anticipation of a slowdown in euro-land or a seizing
up of their banking system created the fundamental motivation to
initiate short positions,” said  Bob Decker , who helps oversee
C$4.2 billion ($4.1 billion) at Aurion Capital Management in
Toronto. “If there’s any sort of positive outcome in Europe
with respect to economic stability, the people in those
positions are unwinding it because they are a bit nervous.”  
 The S&P/TSX advanced 0.8 percent last week as Chinese
exports and U.S. consumer confidence increased more than most
economists estimated. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price
Index has climbed six straight days, the longest streak since
October. Energy and raw-materials companies make up 46 percent
of Canadian stocks by market value.  
 Industrial Production  
 Industrial production  rose 0.8 percent in April, the
European Union’s statistics office said today. Economists had
forecast a gain of 0.5 percent, according to the median of 33
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. From a year earlier, April
production jumped 9.5 percent, the most for a 12-month period
since the data started in 1991.  
 The Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against
the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss
franc, dropped as much as 1.5 percent as investors sought
higher-yielding assets.  
 Meanwhile, sales of new cars and trucks decreased 4.7
percent in April, Statistics Canada said. All 12 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey forecast a fall of at least 5 percent.  
 All eight  publicly traded Canadian lenders climbed. Royal
Bank rose 1.4 percent to C$53.74 to contribute the most to the
S&P/TSX’s gain. Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-
biggest bank, advanced 1.3 percent to C$71.37. Bank of Montreal,
the No. 4 bank by assets, gained 0.9 percent to C$61.64.  
 S&P/TSX gold stocks slumped the most in three weeks as the
metal retreated as much as 1 percent. Goldcorp fell for a fifth
day, dropping 2.9 percent to C$43.85. Barrick Gold Corp., the
world’s largest gold producer, declined 2.8 percent to C$43.32.  
 Industrial Metals Producers  
 Forty-one of 53  S&P/TSX energy producers  gained as natural
gas exceeded $5 per million British thermal units on forecasts
for hot weather in the U.S.  
 TransCanada climbed 1 percent to C$36.38. Enbridge Inc.,
the country’s biggest pipeline company, gained 1.1 percent to
C$49.31. Talisman Energy Inc., which produces oil and gas in
 North America, the North Sea and Indonesia , rose 0.8 percent to
C$17.80.  
 Magna International Inc., the country’s biggest auto-parts
maker, advanced 3.7 percent to C$71.87 after the company said
RiskMetrics Group recommended shareholders approve a deal to buy
out founder  Frank Stronach ’s Class B shares. The Canada Pension
Plan Investment Board, which owns about 1 percent of the Class A
shares, opposes the proposal.  
 Viterra Inc., Canada’s largest grain handler, plunged 7.1
percent, the most since April 2009, to C$7.64 after Desjardins
Securities analyst  Edward Sollbach  changed his rating on the
stock to “strong long-term sell” from “sell.”  
 Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer, sank 1.6 percent to C$102.21 after analyst
 Keith Carpenter  reduced his 12-month price estimate on its U.S.-
listed shares to $135 from $145. Carpenter told clients the
company should earn less this year than he previously estimated
due in part to a reduction in the forecast price of nitrogen
fertilizer.
