             FIFA, soccer’s governing body, and
South African organizers of the World Cup are investigating
transportation plans in Port Elizabeth after thousands of seats
were empty at a June 12 soccer game between South Korea and
Greece.  
 “There is an investigation into transport arrangements at
the game in Port Elizabeth,”  Rich Mkhondo , chief communications
officer of the World Cup Organizing Committee, said in an
interview from his mobile phone today. FIFA aims to find out
“why people who bought tickets didn’t come.”  
 At least 8,000 of the more than 39,000 seats for which FIFA
said it sold tickets were empty, Johannesburg-based Business Day
newspaper reported today. Companies bought some of the tickets,
Mkhondo said. The Nelson Mandela Bay stadium has a capacity to
seat about 45,000, according to FIFA.  
 The World Cup, which began on June 11, is the first to be
held in Africa. The government has spent about 43 billion rand
($5.6 billion) on stadiums, transportation and other
infrastructure in preparation for the tournament.
