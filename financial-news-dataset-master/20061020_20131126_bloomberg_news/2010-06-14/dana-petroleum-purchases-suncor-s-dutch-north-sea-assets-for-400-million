             Dana Petroleum Plc , a U.K. oil and
gas explorer, agreed to buy Suncor Energy Inc.’s Dutch North Sea
assets for 328 million euros ($400 million) in cash in its
biggest purchase to date.  
 The acquisition will boost Dana’s previous production
estimate for this year by as much as 12 percent, the Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company said today in a statement. Output will
increase by as much as 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
2011 and 14,000 barrels in 2012. It will also add 31 million
barrels of proved and probable reserves, the company said.  
 Dana, which holds more than 100 interests in exploration
and production licenses in nine countries, reported a
“significant” gas discovery in the U.K. southern North Sea in
April. Suncor, Canada’s biggest oil company, is selling assets
acquired through last year’s takeover of Petro-Canada.  
 A $900 million term loan and revolving credit facility from
the Royal Bank of Canada to pay for the assets is also part of a
“broader corporate refinancing initiative,” the company said.  
 The cash payment of 328 million euros is calculated by
taking the headline sum of 445 million euros at Jan. 1 and
deducting an amount equal to the debt owed by Suncor to Petro
Canada, Dana said. The headline amount also includes post-tax
cashflow generated between Jan. 1 and the date of completion.  
 Dana rose 0.6 percent to 1,095 pence as of 2:30 p.m. in
London. The stock is down 14 percent in the past 12 months.  
 The deal is expected to complete in the third quarter.
