             Swiss stocks  advanced for a fourth
day before a report that may show the euro region’s industrial
production increased for an 11th straight month in April.  
 ABB Ltd., the world’s biggest supplier of power grids, and
UBS AG, Switzerland’s largest bank, rose more than 0.8 percent.  
 The  Swiss Market Index , a gauge of the biggest and most
actively traded Swiss companies, increased 0.3 percent to
6,445.2 at 9:47 a.m. in Zurich. The broader  Swiss Performance
Index  climbed 0.3 percent to 5,657.08.  
 The SMI jumped 2 percent last week after the Federal
Reserve said it would act as needed to support the recovery and
economic reports lifted investors’ confidence. The benchmark
index has still dropped 7.4 percent from this year’s high on
April 15 on concern that some European nations will struggle to
fund their deficits without hurting the economic recovery.  
 Euro-region industrial output expanded 0.5 percent in April
from March, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before
the European Union publishes data today. The report is due at 11
a.m. Frankfurt time.  
 ABB rose 1.2 percent to 20.48 Swiss francs. UBS climbed 0.8
percent to 15.08 francs.  
 OC Oerlikon Corp. AG  increased 1.3 percent to 5.46 francs,
gaining for a third day. Renova Group, an investment vehicle for
Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg , said it raised its stake
in the Swiss textile machinery maker to 46 percent.  
 Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG  climbed 2 percent to 90
francs, a fourth day of gains. The Swiss freight forwarder is
“confident” it will this month settle a dispute with U.S.
authorities over alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in Nigeria, Chief Executive Officer  Monika Ribar 
told  Sonntag .
