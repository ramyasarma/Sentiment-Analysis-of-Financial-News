             The 1-1 draw with England in its
opening game of the World Cup was the most-watched game for the
U.S. national soccer team since 1994, ESPN said.  
 The match, shown on ABC, averaged 13 million viewers, ESPN
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The transmission
attracted the biggest audience for any game at the tournament in
South Africa so far, the broadcaster said.  
 ESPN and ABC, owned by  Walt Disney Co. , have averaged 4.94
million viewers through five games, more than double the figures
for the corresponding fixtures in the 2006 World Cup, the
statement said.  
 The game against England had the most viewers since the U.S.
played Brazil in the round of 16 at the 1994 World Cup, which
was held in the U.S. Brazil won that game 1-0 on its way to
winning the title for a fourth time.  
 The U.S. earned a draw against England when goalkeeper
 Robert Green  allowed  Clint Dempsey ’s shot to bounce off his
hands and into the net five minutes before halftime. The goal
canceled out  Steven Gerrard ’s fourth-minute strike.
