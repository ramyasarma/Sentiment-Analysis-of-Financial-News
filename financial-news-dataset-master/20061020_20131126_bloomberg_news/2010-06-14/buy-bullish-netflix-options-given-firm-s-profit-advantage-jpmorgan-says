             Investors should buy bullish Netflix
Inc.  options  while selling bearish ones because the movie
subscription service’s technology makes it more profitable than
rivals, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  
 Equity derivatives strategists  Amyn Bharwani  and  Marko Kolanovic  recommended buying September $120 calls while selling
September $110 puts. The trade, known as a risk reversal,
profits if Netflix shares are above $125.15 when the contracts
expire in three months, the strategists wrote in a report before
the open of U.S. exchanges. The shares climbed 5.1 percent,  the
most in a month, to close at $123.29 in New York.  
 The strategists cited JPMorgan stock analyst  Imran Khan ,
who raised his share-price forecast to $133 on June 9 and
boosted his estimates for earnings and subscriber growth. He
 maintained  his “overweight” rating on the shares. Netflix,
based in Los Gatos, California, is poised to benefit as
consumers buy more devices to watch movies over the Internet and
video rental stores close, putting $1 billion in revenue “up
for grabs.”  
 “The company’s unique technology and reach allow it to
monetize content in ways competitors can’t,” Khan wrote. “We
think downside in the stock is limited.”  
 Neflix competes against Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. and
Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California.
