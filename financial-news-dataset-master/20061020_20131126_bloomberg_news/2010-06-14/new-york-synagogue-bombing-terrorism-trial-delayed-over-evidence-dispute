             The trial of four men charged with
plotting to set off explosives outside a New York synagogue and
shoot down military planes with anti-aircraft missiles was
delayed over a dispute regarding possible exculpatory evidence.  
 The charges against the men, residents of Newburgh, New
York, include conspiracy and attempting to use weapons of mass
destruction within the U.S., to acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles and to kill officers and employees of the U.S.,
according to their indictment.  
 Jury selection was to begin this week in federal court in
White Plains, New York. The start of trial was delayed after
defense lawyers sought unspecified documents related to
potentially exculpatory evidence.  
 “It’s a really untenable situation for us,” said Vincent
Briccetti, a lawyer for the defendants, who said he may seek to
have the charges thrown out unless the government provides the
evidence. “Dismissal of the case is a big deal and we’re not
being flip about this.”  
 The defendants, James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta
Williams and Laguerre Payen, face as much as life in prison if
convicted of the most serious charges.  
 They were arrested in May 2009 after attempting to detonate
explosives near a synagogue and Jewish community center in the
Riverdale section of the Bronx, in New York City, according to
the indictment. The four men also plotted to shoot down military
planes at the New York Air National Guard Base at Stewart
Airport in Newburgh using Stinger missiles, the government said.  
 Reviewing Material  
 Prosecutors are reviewing the requested material to
determine whether to challenge the defense bid. They have 48
hours to decide, according to the court.  
 “It is not to gain any advantage for the government or
otherwise,” said prosecutor David Raskin at a hearing today in
White Plains.  
 U.S. District Judge  Colleen McMahon  said she will hear
arguments next week on whether to grant the defendants bail.
They are currently in federal custody. A new date for jury
selection wasn’t set.  
 The case is U.S. v. Cromitie, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (White Plains).
