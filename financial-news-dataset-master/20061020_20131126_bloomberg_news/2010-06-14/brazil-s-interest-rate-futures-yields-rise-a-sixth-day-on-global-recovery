             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts climbed for a sixth day, the longest streak
since February, on speculation policy makers will boost
borrowing costs as the global economy shows signs of recovery.  
 The yield on the contract due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 11.16 percent at 2:16 p.m. New York time. The yield has risen
24 basis points since June 4.  
 “The market was questioning whether the next rate increase
would be 75 basis points or 50, and now they’re seeing that
it’ll be 75,” said  Eduardo Duarte , a currency trader at
Interbolsa do Brasil, the Sao Paulo-based unit of Colombia’s
biggest brokerage.  
 The central bank last week raised the benchmark Selic rate
0.75 percentage point, the second consecutive increase of that
amount, to 10.25 percent.  
 Brazil’s real was little changed at 1.8103 per dollar, from
1.8107 on June 11.
