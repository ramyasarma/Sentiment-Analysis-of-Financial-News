             Copper gained for a fifth day, and
was on pace for its longest rally in more than five months, on
signs of sustained demand in China after domestic inventories
fell for a sixth week. Nickel, zinc and lead advanced.  
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange added 1.7
percent to $6,589 a metric ton at 2:21 p.m. in Singapore, the
highest price in a week. The metal is heading for its longest
advance since the six-day climb ended Jan. 4. July-delivery
copper in New York was 2.1 percent higher at $2.9650 a pound.
China’s markets are closed today and will reopen on June 17.  
 China’s  stockpiles  of copper dropped 8.8 percent to 139,332
tons last week, the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 19.
 Inventories  tallied by the London Metal Exchange were at 465,000
tons on June 11, the lowest level this year.  
 “Total exchange stocks have fallen over 70,000 tons since
their combined peak at the end of April,” Societe Generale
analysts led by the head of commodity research,  Frederic Lasserre , wrote in a report.  
 Copper in London last week capped its best week since April
after government reports showed China’s exports jumped 48.5
percent in May from a year ago, surpassing all 32 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists, signaling Europe’s debt
crisis isn’t yet weighing on the global recovery.  
 Chinese export data “demonstrated significant consumption
growth” from destination economies,  Hussein Allidina , head of
commodities research at Morgan Stanley, said in an e-mail.  
 Nickel Climbs  
 Nickel climbed for a second day, rising 2.1 percent to
$19,950 a ton at 1:49 p.m. in Singapore.  
 Nickel pig iron makers in China, the world’s largest
consumer of nickel, have started to idle capacity as prices and
demand weaken amid the nation’s curbs on property development,
according to a state-owned researcher.  
 Production of the low-cost substitute for the refined metal
dropped to between 14,000 and 15,000 tons in April from a record
17,000 tons in March, said  Xu Aidong , senior nickel analyst at
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. There would be
further falls in output in May and this month, Xu said.  
 Among other LME-traded metals, aluminum rose 1 percent to
$1,963.75 a ton, zinc gained 1.8 percent to $1,770.75 a ton,
lead added 2.2 percent to $1,707 a ton, while tin was unchanged
at $16,550 a ton.  
 Metals also advanced today as the dollar declined to a one-
week low against the euro before a European report that
economists said will show industrial production expanded for an
11th month. Dollar-denominated commodities tend to move
inversely to the U.S. currency.
