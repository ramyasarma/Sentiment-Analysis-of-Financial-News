             As many as 80 percent of Islamic
money managers risk failing because they lack critical mass and
regulations aren’t harmonized enough across countries, according
to Ernst & Young LLP.  
 “Islamic fund managers say they still have very little
understanding of how to move towards new markets and
geographies,” Ernst & Young Partner Sameer Abdi told the  World
Islamic Banking Conference  in Singapore today, the first time
the event has been held in Asia. “Most struggle with going
cross-border, and Shariah compliance across markets is very
different.”  
 Most Islamic funds have assets under management of less
than $100 million, making it “tough” to survive and forcing
consolidation, Abdi said. Islamic fund managers should target
the “mass affluent market” in Islamic financial centers such
as Malaysia and Dubai, rather than focus on a smaller number of
high-net worth individuals, Abdi said.  
 Abdi was discussing findings from Ernst & Young’s annual
Islamic Funds and Investments Report 2010, which interviewed
more than 2,600 conventional and Islamic fund managers globally.  
 The financial services industry complying with Muslim law,
or Shariah, is expected to top $1 trillion in assets soon,
according to  Lim Hng Kiang , Singapore’s minister for trade and
industry. Shariah law governs investments based on Islamic rules,
including banning the receipt of interest, or investments in
gambling or alcohol.
