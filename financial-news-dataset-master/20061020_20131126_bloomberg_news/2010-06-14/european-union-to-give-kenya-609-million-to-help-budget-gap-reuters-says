             The European Union will give Kenya,
home to East Africa’s biggest economy, about 500 million euros
($609 million) to supplement its 2010-11 fiscal budget,  Reuters 
reported.  
 The amount is 25 percent more than that provided in the
previous year, the news service said on June 12, citing an EU
statement published in a newspaper. Reuters didn’t identify the
newspaper.  
 The Kenyan government said June 10 that its budget deficit
would widen next year to 6.8 percent of gross domestic product
as the country boosts spending on salaries for teachers and
other state employees. This would probably put pressure on the
government to borrow to cover the shortfall, said  Simon Freemantle , an economist at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd.  
 About 82.7 billion shillings ($1.03 billion) of the
expenditure would come from donors and an additional 105.3
billion shillings from domestic borrowings, he said.
