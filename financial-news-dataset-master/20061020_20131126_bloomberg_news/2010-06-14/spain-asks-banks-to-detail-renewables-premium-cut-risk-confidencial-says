             Spain’s industry ministry has begun 
a round of contacts with the country’s banks to better 
understand their level of risk in the event of cuts to  
renewable energy premiums, El Confidencial reported, citing 
people familiar with the situation it didn’t identify by name.  
 Banks have provided more than 15 billion euros ($18.3 
billion) in credit to finance solar projects, the news Web site
reported. In the event of a reduction in premiums, they may 
have to ask investors to put up more equity or risk having to 
take the assets onto their books, El Confidencial said.
