             The soccer World Cup in South Africa
has grounded aircraft operators because of unexpected airspace
closures around stadiums, Business Day reported, citing Kosie
Marais, chairman of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.  
 The South African Airforce last week began closing airspace
for 54 kilometers (34 miles) around stadiums being used in the
tournament during match periods, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. the ban has hindered access to some airports,
Marais said, according to the newspaper.
