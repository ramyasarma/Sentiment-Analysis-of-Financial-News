             Malaysian retailers have stopped
selling sugar, flour and cooking oil due to a new government
ruling that they must get a license to sell these items, the New
Straits Times reported, citing Lean Hing Chuan, president of the
Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Association. The 20,000-
member group will continue the boycott until the government
scraps the requirement, the report said.
