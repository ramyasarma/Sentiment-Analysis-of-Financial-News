             Societe Generale SA , France’s
second-largest bank, is in talks to buy Societe Marseillaise de
Credit from BPCE SA for 872 million euros ($1.1 billion) to
boost its consumer network in the southeast of the country.  
 The Paris-based company plans to merge the lender, which
has 144 branches and about 200,000 customers, into its Credit du
Nord network, the bank said in a  statement  on its website today.
 Societe Generale  rose as much as 5 percent to 35.40 euros in
Paris trading and was at 35.18 euros at 11:40 a.m.  
 The deal would enable the company to “further consolidate
its position as the third retail-banking network in France,” it
said in the statement. The acquisition would be financed by a
sale of new shares that will be subscribed by Societe Generale,
the company said.  
 The lender agreed to pay 676 million euros to Dexia SA in
December to take full control of Lille, France-based Credit du
Nord to bolster its French consumer-banking business.  
 BPCE is France’s second-biggest retail-banking network by
branches behind Credit Agricole SA.
