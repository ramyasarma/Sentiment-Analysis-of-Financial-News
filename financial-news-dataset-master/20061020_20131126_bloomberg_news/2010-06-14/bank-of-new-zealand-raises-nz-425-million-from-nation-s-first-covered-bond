             Bank of New Zealand  raised NZ$425
million ($295 million) in the first covered bond sale by an
Australasian bank as it seeks to bolster its balance sheet.  
 The Auckland-based lender, a unit of National Australia
Bank Ltd., priced NZ$175 million of five-year notes to yield 6
percent and NZ$250 million of seven-year bonds to yield 6.425
percent, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “Issuing five-year and seven-year bonds in these
significant volumes in the New Zealand market” will support the
bank’s “balance sheet strength,” Mahes Hettige, BNZ’s head of
balance sheet management, said in the statement.  
 The $2.9 trillion covered bond market may offer “the way
forward” as lenders seek to increase their financial strength
after the global credit crisis, Hettige said at a conference
last month. Covered bonds, which are mostly sold by European
banks, attract higher credit ratings than regular notes and
typically pay less interest because they’re backed by a pool of
assets such as mortgages that can be sold in a default.  
 Australian banks, which own the four largest lenders in New
Zealand, are barred from selling covered bonds in their home
market. Australia’s financial regulator forbids the notes
because it says the home loans used as security wouldn’t be
available to repay depositors if a bank defaulted.  
 BNZ’s NZ$3 billion covered bond program is “credit
positive” for the company and “widens the range of available
wholesale funding options” for all New Zealand banks, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a June 8 report.
