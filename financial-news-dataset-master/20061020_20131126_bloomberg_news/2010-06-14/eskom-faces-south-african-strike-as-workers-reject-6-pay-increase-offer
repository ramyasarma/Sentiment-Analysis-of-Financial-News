             Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned
South African power utility, offered to increase the pay of
workers by 6 percent, improving an earlier offer, the National
Union of Mineworkers said.  
 The latest offer was rejected by the labor union, which
will tomorrow seek permission to strike, Lesiba Seshoka, a
spokesman for the Johannesburg-based union, said in a mobile
phone interview today. The company on June 3 increased its offer
to 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent.
