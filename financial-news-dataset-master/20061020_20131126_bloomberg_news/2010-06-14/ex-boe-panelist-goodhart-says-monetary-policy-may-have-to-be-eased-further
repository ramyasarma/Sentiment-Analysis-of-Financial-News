             The Bank of England may need to
expand its bond-buying program further later this year to
counterbalance fiscal tightening to tackle Britain’s record
budget deficit, former policy maker  Charles Goodhart  said.  
 “If the economy should start faltering, should start
growing slower, then the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee must take up the baton and restart quantitative
easing,” Goodhart said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in London today. “It may be necessary to restart
quantitative easing later on this year.”  
 The Bank of England held the  target  for its bond holdings
at 200 billion pounds ($293 billion) last week to aid the
economic recovery. Officials are trying to stave off contagion
from the euro region’s sovereign debt crisis and the prospect of
a relapse in the economy from the deepest budget cuts since at
least the early 1980s.  
 “To the degree that fiscal policy has to be a little bit
tighter in order to maintain credibility, the counterpart to
that should be that monetary policy should be and remain
somewhat easier and possibly be eased further in order to
maintain balance in the economy,” Goodhart said.
