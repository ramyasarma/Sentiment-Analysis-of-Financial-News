             South Africa’s World Cup organizers
replaced security guards with police officers at stadiums in
Cape Town and Durban after the officials went on strike over
pay, Rich Mkhondo, chief communications officer of the Local
Organizing Committee, said.  
 Security officials meant to monitor the match between Italy
and Paraguay quit their posts before the game, he said in a
mobile phone interview today. Riot police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets to break up a protest over pay following
yesterday’s match between Germany and Australia in Durban, on
South Africa’s east coast.
