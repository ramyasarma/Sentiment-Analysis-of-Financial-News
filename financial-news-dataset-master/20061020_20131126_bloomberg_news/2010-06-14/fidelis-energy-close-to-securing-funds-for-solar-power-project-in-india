                  June 14 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  Fidelis Energy
Inc.  said it expects to secure additional funding within the
month for its $25 million solar photovoltaic project, which is
being developed in partnership with India’s Esar Solar Power.  
 “The company is currently in negotiations with six
separate entities interested in additional funding for this
project,” Fidelis Chief Executive  James Poole  said in a
statement to shareholders. “Three of these are well known
financial institutions looking for solar projects and the other
three are very well known solar companies. Management feels that
a letter of intent from one or more of these sources could be
signed within the next 15 days.”  
 The company had already secured $30 million in funding from
Empres Voss Capital of Switzerland in January.  
 The project to generate 5 megawatts of electricity near
Jaisalmer in Rajasthan state is part of a larger 100-megawatt
facility in the Thar desert.  
 The region gets 330 days of sunshine per year “and
receives up to 6.2 kilowatt hours of solar energy per square
meter every day, which is the highest in the world,” the
company said in the statement.  
 The company said that the 960 acres of land required for
the project will be “purchased from a syndicate of landowners
at a cost of approximately $3.7 million.” The site is about 5
kilometers from the nearest government substation connected to
the grid, it said.
