             A limestone head by the 20th-century
sculptor  Amedeo Modigliani  sold today at an auction in Paris
for 43.2 million euros ($53 million) including fees.  
 The price was more than 10 times the low estimate and a
record for any work of art sold at a French auction.  
 Christie’s International  said it had expected Modigliani’s
“Tete” to sell for between 4 million euros and 6 million
euros at hammer price. The 2-foot-high (0.6 meter) modernist
piece, influenced by African sculpture and the work of the
artist’s mentor  Constantin Brancusi , was one of the last
Modigliani sculptures left in private hands, said Christie’s.  
 It had been in the collection of Gaston Levy, co-founder
of the business that what would become the Monoprix supermarket
chain, since 1927, said Christie’s. The anonymous buyer, making
a telephone bid, beat one European and one U.S. bidder, said
the auction house: 15 phones were registered to bid.  
 The previous auction record for France was for a Matisse
painting at Christie’s Yves St. Laurent auction, said 
Christie’s. The Matisse still life of cowslips fetched 35.9 
million euros (then $45.6 million) in Feb. 2009.
