             Mexico’s peso rose for a fifth day,
the longest winning streak in two months, on speculation a
global economic recovery will encourage investors to buy higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The peso gained 0.4 percent to 12.6031 per dollar at 9:32
a.m. New York time, from 12.6548 on June 11. The currency gained
for nine straight days during the period ended April 6.  
 “Risk appetite returns in emerging markets,” wrote
analysts at UBS AG. “Both the Mexican peso and Brazilian real
were bought against the dollar. Strong emerging-market growth
expectations will continue to lift positioning in these
currencies.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.26 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.5 centavo to
124.49 centavos per peso.
