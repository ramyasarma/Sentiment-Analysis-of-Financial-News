             Ukraine’s currency will remain
stable in the “short term,” with the hryvnia trading between
7.8 and 7.9 per dollar in the “next quarters,” said Anatoly
Balyuk, the central bank’s executive director of foreign
currency regulation, in Kiev today.  
 The bank will continue its policies to stabilize the
hryvnia, he said.
