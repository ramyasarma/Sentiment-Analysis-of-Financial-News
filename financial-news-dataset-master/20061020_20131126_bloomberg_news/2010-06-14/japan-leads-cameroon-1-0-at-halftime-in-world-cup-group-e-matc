             Japan leads Cameroon 1-0 at halftime
in their soccer World Cup Group E match in Bloemfontein, South
Africa today.   
 Keisuke Honda scored the goal in the 39th minute for Japan,
which is playing at its fourth straight World Cup.

for a second time, with Cameroon reaching the quarterfinals in
1990 and Japan making the round of 16 in 2002.  
 The Netherlands beat Denmark 2-0 in the same group earlier
today.
