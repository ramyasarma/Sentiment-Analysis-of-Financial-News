             Corn rose, extending the longest
rally in two months, on signs that demand will increase from
U.S. ethanol makers and China, the world’s second-largest grain
consumer.  
 The U.S. ethanol industry will use 4.7 billion bushels of
corn in the next year, the  government  said on June 10. In May,
the projection was 4.6 billion, and estimated demand a year
earlier was 4.55 billion. U.S. exporters sold 120,000 metric
tons of corn to China for delivery before Aug. 31, the
Department of Agriculture said today.  
 “Plants will produce ethanol beyond their ability to make
money,” said  Darrell Holaday , the president of Advanced Market
Concepts in Manhattan, Kansas. “When you have a $250 million
plant, you’ve got to pay the bills. I don’t hear a lot of talk
about ethanol plants pulling back” on production, he said.  
 Corn futures for July delivery rose 4 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.75 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
climbing for the fifth straight session, the longest advance
since in mid-April. The price has dropped 9.5 percent this year,
partly on forecasts for increased U.S. production.  
 Sina.com, citing industry website China Corn, reported on
June 10 that grain supplies in China’s Jilin province, the
country’s top producer, may be facing damage from mold because
of high temperatures.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
