             Palm oil rose for the first time in
six days amid concern the Argentine supply of soybeans and
soybean oil may be affected by a port strike.  
 August-delivery futures added 1 percent to 2,410 ringgit
($742) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, snapping a
five-day drop of 3.6 percent. The gain was the most since May 20.  
 “According to last week’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange
report, Argentina grain port inspectors may be launching a
strike today due to discontentment over wages,” an AmResearch
Sdn. report said. Argentina is the largest exporter of soybean
oil. Palm and soybean oils are direct substitutes.  
 Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade, which added 1.6
percent on June 11, gained 0.3 percent to $9.12 a bushel at 6
p.m. Singapore time. Chicago soybean oil climbed for a fourth
day, gaining 0.9 percent to 37.22 cents a pound. That made it
$78.42 a ton  more expensive  than palm oil, according to data on
the Bloomberg.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
which is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, gained 0.2
percent to $724.25 a ton.  
 Still, palm oil prices may decline on higher supplies from
soybean oil makers and lower demand if the Europea’s sovereign-
debt crisis curbs purchasing power, according to a report by
Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd.  
 Palm oil may “face further headwinds in the form of
seasonally higher production and slower economic growth as a
result of the European contagion,” the bank said. “Technically,
the price action continues to indicate a less-than-positive
picture, slipping even below the 2,400 ringgit level.”  
 A stronger ringgit also reduces the appeal of palm oil,
grown mainly in Indonesia and Malaysia. The ringgit rose a
fourth day, gaining as much as 0.9 percent to 3.2473 a dollar.
