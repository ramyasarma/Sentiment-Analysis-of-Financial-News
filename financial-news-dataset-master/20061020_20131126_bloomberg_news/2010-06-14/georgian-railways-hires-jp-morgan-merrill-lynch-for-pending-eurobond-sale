             Georgian Railways , the former Soviet
republic’s state-owned rail company, said it hired JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Merrill Lynch to manage a sale of Eurobonds,
without elaborating on the amount or the schedule.  
 “We already have signed agreements with JP Morgan and
Merrill Lynch to place our Eurobonds on the market, but we
cannot say when or what amount is being discussed,” the
company’s director general, Irakli Ezugbaia, said in an
interview in Tbilisi today. “We cannot talk about the details
as it will raise expectations on the market.”  
 Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri said on Feb. 24 that
the rail company may sell as much as $200 million of Eurobonds.
Ezughbaia declined to confirm the amount. He also couldn’t say
whether the government may sell Georgian Railways, whose annual
capacity is set to reach as much as 20 tonnes this year.  
 The company’s only outstanding bond is a 25 million lari
($14.5 million), 13.5 percent security due in 2011, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 Merrill Lynch is a unit of Bank of America Corp.
