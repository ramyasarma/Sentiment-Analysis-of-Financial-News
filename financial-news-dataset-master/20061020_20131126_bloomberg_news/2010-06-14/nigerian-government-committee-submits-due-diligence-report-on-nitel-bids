             A committee conducting further due
diligence on prospective bidders for state-owned Nigerian
Telecommunications Ltd. submitted its report to President
 Goodluck Jonathan , the Bureau of Public Enterprises said.  
 Chukwuma Nwokoh, a spokesman for the BPE, which handles the
sale of state-owned assets, spoke in a phone interview today
from the capital, Abuja. He didn’t provide further details.  
 Nigeria ’s government on Feb. 16 selected New Generation
Telecom Ltd., consisting of  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. ,
Minerva Group of Dubai and Nigeria’s GiCell Wireless Ltd., as
the preferred bidder after the group offered $2.5 billion for
Nitel. On March 9, the head of the BPE was suspended. Two days
later, the government said further due diligence would be
conducted on prospective investors in Nitel.  
 A previous attempt in 2006 to sell Nitel was annulled after
 Transnational Corp. , a Lagos-based investment company, failed to
comply with sale conditions.  
 Since that attempted sale, Nitel’s 500,000 fixed lines in
service have dropped to 45,000, its workforce has declined to
2,000 from 12,000 and the company has $500 million of debt,
 TeleGeography , a Washington-based research company, said last
year. Nitel has lost market share to rivals including MTN
Nigeria Ltd., a unit of  MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s biggest mobile-
phone company.
