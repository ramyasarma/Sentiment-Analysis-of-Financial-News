             International Dairy Queen Inc. , the
soft-serve ice cream franchise owned by  Warren Buffett , reached
an agreement with Al Safwa Food Group to expand in the Middle
East by opening stores in Saudi Arabia.  
 The inaugural Dairy Queen is scheduled for Riyadh in the
first half of 2011, with 32 projected throughout the country by
2015, the Minneapolis-based chain said today in a statement.  
 Dairy Queen is adding to Mideast locations in Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The chain has more
than 5,700 stores, including 680 outside the U.S. and Canada.  
 Al Safwa is a Riyadh-based retail holding group. Dairy
Queen said it will serve its traditional foods such as Blizzard
Treats and GrillBurgers in the Saudi locations.  
 Riyadh’s average June high temperature is 108 degrees
Fahrenheit (42 Celsius), compared with 79 degrees in
Minneapolis, according to Foreca and Weather Decision
Technologies.  
 Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , based in Omaha,
Nebraska, acquired Dairy Queen in 1998.
