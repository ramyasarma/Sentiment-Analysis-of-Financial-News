             Appreciation of the yuan won’t solve
the trade imbalance between China and the U.S. or resolve the
U.S.’s consumer debt, low savings rate and unemployment, Qin
Gang, spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said today.  
 The exchange rate isn’t the main reason for the Sino-U.S.
trade imbalance, he said in a statement on the ministry’s
website. China hopes that U.S. politicians will “seriously
consider” how to solve the structural problems in their economy
and not blame others, Qin said.
