             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, has agreed to sell its
Argentine unit to Banco Comafi SA as part of a plan to scale
back international operations and cut its balance sheet.  
 The sale of the business should be completed by the first
half of 2011, the Edinburgh-based lender said in a statement
today. The price was “not material to RBS overall,” the bank
said. The Argentine bank is the country’s 18th-biggest with
about 2.9 billion pesos ($740 million) in deposits and 1.8
billion pesos in loans, according to the country’s  central bank .  
 RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  is selling
assets after his predecessor,  Fred Goodwin , built up the lender
by expanding into more than 54 countries as he made more than
$100 billion of acquisitions. The bank is scaling back
operations in 36 countries after posting the biggest loss in
British corporate history in 2008.  
 RBS also sold its Colombian investment-banking business to
Bank of Nova Scotia in March, as well as its offshore loan book
that covers assets in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. The bank
will continue to have a presence in Mexico and Brazil.  
 The bank, which is 83 percent government owned, is also
seeking to sell its credit card payment processing unit, Global
Merchant Services, and other assets including 318 U.K. branches,
as well as its insurance division. It received 45.5 billion
pounds ($67 billion) in taxpayer-funded capital injections
during the credit crisis.
