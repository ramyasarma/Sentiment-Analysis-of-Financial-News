             Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.  shelved a plan to raise as much as HK$9.09
billion ($1.2 billion) in a share sale in Hong Kong, citing poor
market conditions.  
 The Chinese wind-turbine maker won’t proceed “in light of
the deterioration in market conditions and recent unexpected and
excessive market volatility,” Goldwind said in a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. A sale would be
“inadvisable” at this time, the company said.  
 Goldwind, listed in Shenzhen, dropped its fund-raising
plans after Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  slid more than 10
percent since April 9 and as Europe’s debt crisis curbs
investors’ willingness to take risk, prompting at least three
other companies to shelve offerings in the city.  
 “The Chinese market has been out of favor for the last few
months,” saild  Khiem Do , the Hong Kong-based head of Asian
multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd.
“Some investors have concerns about inflation, wage rises.”  
 Renewable-energy stocks have fallen worldwide after the
failure of United Nations climate talks in December to produce a
treaty to fight global warming and promote clean-power sources.  
 The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index , an 88-
member benchmark with a $2.1 trillion market capitalization, has
declined 24 percent in 2010. That’s almost four times more than
the 6.7 percent drop by the MSCI World Index in the period.  
 Foreign Expansion Blocked  
 The delay may hamper Goldwind’s plans to grow abroad. The
company, which last year got 99 percent of its revenue in China,
had planned to channel almost a quarter of the proceeds from the
share sale on expansion in the U.S., Australia and Europe.  
 The economic slump in the U.S. and Europe has slowed
investment in wind energy, with the average price paid for wind
farms worldwide declining to 1.66 million euros ($2.03 million)
per megawatt from a peak of 1.75 million euros in mid-2008,
according to a report last week by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  
 Goldwind, based in Urumqi city in Xinjiang province, had
planned to sell 395.3 million new shares, equal to a 15 percent
stake, at between HK$19.80 and HK$23 apiece, it said June 6.
About 40 percent of the proceeds would be spent on building
plants and 24 percent on overseas expansion, the company said.  
 Some investors decided to skip the Goldwind sale for the
coming initial public offering by Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. in Shanghai and Hong Kong, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. Goldwind spokesman  Thomas Yao  declined
to comment.  
 Agricultural Bank Sale  
 Agricultural Bank, China’s biggest by number of customers,
may sell as much as $15 billion of shares in Hong Kong,
according to an e-mail sent to investors.  
 Swire Properties Ltd. delayed a plan to sell shares in Hong
Kong on May 6, its parent said at the time. Strikeforce Mining &
Resources Plc, the Russian molybdenum producer controlled by
billionaire  Oleg Deripaska , delayed taking orders for its Hong
Kong IPO until equity markets have stabilized, a person with
knowledge of the decision said on May 8.  
 China Tian Yuan Mining Ltd., the largest privately owned
iron ore producer in the northern province of Hebei, delayed a
Hong Kong IPO last month, two people with knowledge of the
decision said on May 7.  
 “The fact that AgriBank is continuing to push through with
their IPO is a positive sign, although the valuation obviously
cannot be as optimistic as it was before,” Baring Asset’s Do
said.  
 Markets in China are closed June 14 to June 16 for a
holiday.
