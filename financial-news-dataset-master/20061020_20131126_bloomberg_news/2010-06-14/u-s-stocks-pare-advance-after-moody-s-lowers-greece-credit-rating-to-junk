             U.S. stocks pared gains after
Moody’s downgraded Greece’s credit rating.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,098.11 at 1:08 p.m. in New York after jumping as much as 1.3
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased
60.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,271.15.  
 Moody’s cut Greece’s credit rating to Ba1 from A3, the
ratings company said today in a statement.
