             Chile’s peso strengthened for a
fourth straight day, the longest winning streak in six weeks, as
economists forecast the central bank will raise borrowing costs,
and as the  euro  rose on faster-than-forecast output growth.  
 The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 534.35 per dollar at
10:13 a.m. New York time, from 537.25 on June 11. The currency
gained during four straight days in the period ended May 3.  
 European  industrial output  rose 0.8 percent in April, more
than the 0.5 percent median forecast of 33 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Chile’s central bank tomorrow will raise its
benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 0.75 percent, the
first rate increase since September 2008, according to the
median forecast of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “We had a very strong open because of industrial
production in Europe, which was positive for European growth and
had a strong effect on the euro, and therefore on the Chilean
peso,” said  Ruben Catalan , an economist at BCI Corredor de
Bolsa in Santiago. “About 80 percent of local currency movement
can be explained by movement in the euro, or the international
movement of the dollar, which had been holding the peso back.”
