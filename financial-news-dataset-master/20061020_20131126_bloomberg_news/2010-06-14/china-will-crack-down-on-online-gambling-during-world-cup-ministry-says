             China will crack down on gambling on
the Internet during the football World Cup and will “severely
punish” anyone caught betting online, the Ministry of Public
Security said in a statement on its Web site yesterday.  
 Law enforcement agencies have investigated more than 740
online gambling cases and arrested more than 3,600 people since
starting a “strike hard” campaign against the crime in January,
according to the statement. More than 700 million yuan ($102
million) has been impounded, the ministry said.
