             FIFA, soccer’s governing body, said 
it will investigate transport problems in the South African 
city of Port Elizabeth after at least 8,000 seats were empty at
a soccer World Cup match between Greece and South Korea on June
12, Business Day reported.  
 More than 39,000 tickets for the 42,486-seat Nelson Mandela
Bay Stadium were sold, FIFA said, according to the 
Johannesburg-based newspaper. A bus service to the stadium may 
have been inadequate, the newspaper said, citing Nicolas 
Maingot, a FIFA spokesman.  
 Lencedo Njezula, a spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay 
Municipality, denied that there had been transport problems, 
the newspaper said.
