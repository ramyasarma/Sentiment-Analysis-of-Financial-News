             Transocean Ltd.  can’t use a 159-
year-old law to stall claims by the U.S. or state governments
over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a federal judge in Houston
said.  
 Transocean asked U.S. District Judge  Keith Ellison  in May
to limit its liability for damages caused by the spill in the
Gulf of Mexico to the value of the rig’s unpaid drilling rental
fees, about $27 million. Ellison ordered a stay on claims
against Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon, until after
he ruled on the company’s cap request.  
 The stay doesn’t apply to claims by the U.S., state or
tribal governments brought under the federal Oil Pollution Act
or to U.S. claims under other federal environmental laws,
Ellison said today.  
 The U.S. asked Ellison June 1 to rule the cap, stemming
from the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, didn’t apply to
government claims. That law is pre-empted by the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990, the U.S. said. Transocean last week agreed that the
requested cap in the 1851 law wouldn’t apply to environmental
losses by the U.S. and Gulf Coast states.  
 The case is In Re the Complaint and Petition of Triton
Asset Leasing GmbH, Transocean Holdings LLC, 10-01721, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).
