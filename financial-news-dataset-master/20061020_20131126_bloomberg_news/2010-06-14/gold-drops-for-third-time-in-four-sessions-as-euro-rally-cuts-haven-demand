             Gold fell for the third time in four
sessions as a rally in the euro reduced demand for the precious
metal as a haven. Platinum rose the most in two weeks on
improved prospects for industrial commodities.  
 The euro rose as much as 1.5 percent against the dollar
after European industrial production rose more than forecast in
April, easing concern that a sovereign-debt crisis in the region
would derail the economy. Gold has surged 12 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,254.50 an ounce on June 8, as the euro
plunged 15 percent.  
 “A lot of the risk trade has abated with a rally in the
euro,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “That’s the biggest reason to sell gold.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $5.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,224.50 on the Comex in New York. The price has
dropped 2.4 percent from the all-time high.  
 Gold futures gained in each of the previous nine years.
Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, have increased 15 percent in 2010.  
 The metal may be too expensive for jewelers, analysts said.  
 “The challenge for gold is to replicate the heightened ETF
demand that occurred in the second half of May,”  Edel Tully , an
analyst at UBS AG in London, said in a report. “On the scrap-
supply front, metal is visible, but this supply source is not at
extreme levels. Jewelry demand from India and other regional
hubs in Asia is also sedate.”  
 Platinum, Palladium  
 Precious metals with wider industrial applications rallied
on bets that demand for raw materials will increase as the
global economy recovers. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a one-
month high.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $28.40, or 1.9
percent, to $1,563.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since May
26.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery gained $14.05, or
3.1 percent, $462.60 an ounce.  
 Silver futures for July delivery rose 18 cents, or 1
percent, to $18.411 an ounce on the Comex.
