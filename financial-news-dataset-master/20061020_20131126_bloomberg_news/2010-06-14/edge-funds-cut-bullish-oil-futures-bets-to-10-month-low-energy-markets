             Hedge funds cut their bets on higher
oil-futures prices to a 10-month low as U.S. economic reports
signaled fuel demand is diminishing.  
 Speculative  net-long positions , or wagers that prices will
increase, in crude futures declined 30 percent to 17,457
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the week ended
June 8, the lowest level since July, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s  Commitments of Traders Report 
released on June 11. Bets on gains have dropped 87 percent since
reaching a record 135,669 in January.  
 Traders retreated from bets on rising oil prices as the
euro depreciated to a four-year low on concern efforts to cut
budgets in Europe because of the debt crisis will curb the
global rebound. U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in May for
the first time in eight months, the Commerce Department said
June 11. Oil prices in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of
the fuel, have slipped 15 percent from a 20-month high in May.  
 “Unwinding long positions makes a lot of sense given the
uncertainty about global economic growth, the end of the uptrend
in prices and the relatively weak euro,” said  Kyle Cooper , a
managing director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in Houston.
“We saw the same factors at work in reverse at the beginning of
the year.”  
 Crude for July delivery rose 1.8 percent to $75.12 today,
building on last week’s 3.2 percent gain.  
 ‘Modest Improvement’  
 U.S.  retail sales  decreased 1.2 percent in May, the biggest
decline since September, according to last week’s Commerce
Department report. Companies added 41,000 workers to payrolls in
May, the fewest in four months and down from a 218,000 increase
in April, the Labor Department said on June 4.  
 While showing signs of “modest improvement” this year,
the U.S. economy will take time to recapture the jobs lost
during the recession, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said on June 9 in a speech in Richmond, Virginia.  
 Crude touched $87.15 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
May 3, the highest level since Oct. 9, 2008, before trading as
low as $69.51 June 7.  
 The decline accelerated as the euro weakened against the
dollar, reducing the appeal of commodities as an alternative
investment. The euro depreciated to $1.1877 on June 7, the
lowest level since March 2006, on concern that the region’s
sovereign debt crisis would spread from Greece to other nations.
The 16-nation currency traded at $1.2229 at 3:43 p.m. today in
New York.  
 Reallocating Assets  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has retreated 10 percent
since reaching a 19-month high of 1,219.83 on April 26.  
 “We’re seeing a lot of asset reallocation,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.
“Investors have been selling crude as the euro and equities
have dropped.”  
 Speculators are trimming bets on rising crude prices as the
U.S. continues to consume less of the commodity than it did
before the global financial crisis. Oil demand in the world’s
biggest economy will be 18.97 million barrels a day in 2010, the
International Energy Agency said June 10, compared with 20.68
million in 2007. It was 18.77 million barrels a day last year.  
 Hedge funds and other large speculators were less bearish
on natural gas, the CFTC report showed.  Net-short positions  in
gas futures, or bets on falling prices, declined 11 percent to
154,750 lots, the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 19 and
the biggest single-week drop since March 2009.  
 Hurricane Season  
 Natural gas for July delivery advanced 22.5 cents, or 4.7
percent, to $5.006 per million British thermal units in New York
today. The contract touched $4.995 on June 8, the highest price
since Feb. 19.  
 “They are probably getting ready for the hurricane season
and possible disruptions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York.  
 Colorado State University researchers boosted their
forecast for the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season on June 2,
calling for 18 named storms, 10 of them becoming hurricanes. The
U.S. season began June 1 and ends Nov. 30.  
 Gas futures rose to a record $15.78 per million Btu in
December 2005 after the worst hurricane season on record damaged
production platforms and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Speculators increased their  bets  on gains in heating oil
futures by 20 percent to 13,809 contracts, the CFTC data showed.
Futures for July delivery rose 4.76 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$2.0053 a gallon in New York during the week ended June 11.  
 Wagers that gasoline futures will gain rose 4.3 percent to
27,100 contracts in New York, the first increase in five weeks.
Gasoline for July delivery rose 5.44 cents, or 2.7 percent, to
$2.0497 a gallon in the week ended June 11.
