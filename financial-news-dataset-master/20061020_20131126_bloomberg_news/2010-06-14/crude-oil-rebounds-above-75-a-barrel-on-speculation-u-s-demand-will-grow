             Crude oil advanced in New York to
trade above $75 on speculation growth in the U.S. economy will
boost fuel demand from the world’s biggest energy consumer.  
 Oil climbed for the fourth time in five days as European
equity indexes advanced before reports this week that may show
U.S. factories churned out more goods last month and the cost of
living declined. These may point to a manufacturing-led recovery
without inflation, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The dollar dropped to its lowest level against the
euro in more than a week, bolstering the appeal of commodities.  
 “The market is moving on the usual suspects,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “It’s a sentiment-driven rally based on a weaker
dollar, stronger equities, and bargain-hunting by investors.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose as much as $1.92, or 2.6
percent, to $75.70 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $75.45 at 12:51
p.m. London time. Brent crude oil for July delivery rose $1.47
to $75.82 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities increased
in May for the 10th time in 11 months, according to the median
estimate from 63 economists polled by Bloomberg News before
Federal Reserve figures due June 16. Consumer prices probably
declined 0.2 percent in May, after slipping 0.1 percent the
previous month, the survey showed.  
 “Fundamentals are getting better and the euro is also
driving the crude market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity
derivative sales manager at Newedge in Tokyo. “On the downside,
the market is well-supported above $73 at the moment.”  
 Weaker Dollar  
 The dollar declined against the euro for the fourth time in
five days. The single European currency gained as much as 1.2
percent to $1.2259, the highest since June 3, after a report
showed industrial output in the 16 nations using the euro rose
more than economists forecast in April. The  Stoxx Europe 600
Index  gained 0.9 percent to 251.73 as of 12:43 p.m. in London.  
 Oil fell 2.3 percent on June 11 after the Commerce
Department said U.S. retail sales decreased 1.2 percent in May,
the biggest drop since September.  
 Concerns about the viability of the U.S. economic rebound
have led hedge funds to cut their bets on higher oil-futures
prices to a 10-month low.  
 Speculative  net-long positions , or wagers that prices will
increase, in crude futures declined 30 percent to 17,457
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the week ended
June 8, the lowest level since July, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders Report
released on June 11. Bets on gains have dropped 87 percent since
reaching a record 135,669 in January.
