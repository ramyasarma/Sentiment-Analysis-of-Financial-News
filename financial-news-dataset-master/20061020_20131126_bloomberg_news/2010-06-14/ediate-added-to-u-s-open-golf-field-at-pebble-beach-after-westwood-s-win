             Golfer  Rocco Mediate  accepted an
invitation to play in this week’s U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf
Links.  
 Mediate, who will be playing in his 15th U.S. Open, was the
runner-up to  Tiger Woods  at the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines
Golf Course near San Diego following a 19-hole playoff.  
 Mediate, the No. 1 alternate after sectional qualifying,
was offered the spot because  Lee Westwood , who won the St. Jude
Classic yesterday, was already in the field, the  United States
Golf Association  said in a news release.  
 Mediate’s best finish this year is a tie for 48th at the
Farmers Insurance Open. He’s also missed nine weekend cuts and
withdrawn twice in 14 U.S. PGA Tour events.
