             Summer demand may push gasoline
futures up to $2.20 a gallon by mid-July, according to a
technical analysis by Lind-Waldock.  
 “We’ve got a geometrical uptrend line” based on the July
contract,  Blake Robben , a strategist at the division of MF
Global Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. Strength
behind gasoline is due to a second round of demand for the
summer driving season, he said.  
 Extending a line connecting intraday lows in the July-
delivery contract of $1.9008 on May 25 and $1.9609 on June 7
indicates a rally to $2.20, he said.  
 Gasoline for July delivery fell 2.08 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $2.0497 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on June 11. The front-month contract reached a 19-month
high of $2.4411 on May 3.  
 The rally could end if prices close below $1.99 a gallon,
Robben said, after which the July contract would be poised for a
fall to $1.94.
