             Orange-juice futures rose to a
three-week high on speculation that demand for the beverage will
improve amid signs that the economy is recovering. Cotton prices
also gained.  
 Equities rallied before reports this week that may show the
global economy is rebounding, and after the European Union said
industrial output in April rose more than economists forecast.
The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials jumped to a
one-month high as the dollar slumped against a basket of six
major currencies.  
 “We’re just rallying with the basket of commodities
today,” said  James Cordier , an OptionSellers.com portfolio
manager in Tampa, Florida. “It’s partly the realization that
the economy’s getting better.”  
 Orange juice for September delivery rose 2 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $1.4545 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier, futures
touched $1.4695, the highest price for a most-active contract
since May 21. Orange-juice futures have climbed 13 percent this
year.  
 The increase in equities “offers hope for stronger demand
for orange juice in the future, and that’s part of orange
juice’s rally,” Cordier said.  
 Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.53 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 79.47 cents a pound on ICE. Prices have gained 5.1
percent this year.
