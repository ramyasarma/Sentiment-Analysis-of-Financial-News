             Tanzania’s central bank plans to
increase the minimum capital requirements for commercial banks
to 15 billion shillings ($10.3 million) from 5 billion
shillings.  
 This is aimed to “strengthen crisis preparedness to
facilitate a rapid response in the event that a crisis
emerges,” the Bank of Tanzania said in a statement on its
website today. The bank is also targeting an inflation rate of 5
percent by the end of June 2011 and 21.3 percent in private
sector credit growth, it said.
