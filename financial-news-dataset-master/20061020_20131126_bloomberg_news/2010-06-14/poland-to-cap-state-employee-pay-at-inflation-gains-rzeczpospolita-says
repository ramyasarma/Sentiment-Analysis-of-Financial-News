             The Polish government will limit
public sector salary increases to the rate of gains in the
country’s consumer price index,  Rzeczpospolita  reported, without
saying how it obtained information.  
 The Warsaw-based  Finance Ministry  estimates next year’s
average inflation rate at 2.5 percent, the newspaper said.  
 Public-sector wages account for 8.6 percent of total
government spending, while capping increases to the inflation
rate would create savings of at least 1.2 billion zloty ($358
million), Rzeczpospolita said, citing its own estimates.
