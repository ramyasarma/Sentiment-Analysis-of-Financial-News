             Keisuke Honda scored the only goal
as Japan beat Cameroon 1-0 in Group E of soccer’s World Cup in
Bloemfontein, South Africa, today.  
 Honda’s close-range effort after 39 minutes gives Japan,
playing in its fourth straight World Cup, an opening-match
victory for a first time. Cameroon had never lost its opener.  
 Both teams are aiming to progress beyond the group stage
for a second time, with Cameroon reaching the quarterfinals in
1990 and Japan making the round of 16 in 2002.  
 Earlier, the Netherlands beat Denmark 2-0 in the same
group. Defending champion Italy plays Paraguay in Group F later
today.  
 Honda received a cross from the right by Daisuke Matsui at
the far post and struck the ball past goalkeeper Hamidou
Souleymanou to secure Japan’s win. The country’s only previous
World Cup victories came when it was co-host with South Korea
eight years ago.
