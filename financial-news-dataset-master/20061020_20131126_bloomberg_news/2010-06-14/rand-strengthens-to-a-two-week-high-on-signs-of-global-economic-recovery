             South Africa’s rand rose to an
almost two-week high against the dollar as stocks worldwide
gained on signs the global economy is enduring Europe’s debt
crisis, boosting appetite for higher-yielding assets.  
 The currency appreciated as much as 1 percent to 7.6080 per
dollar, the strongest level since June 3, and traded 0.6 percent
up at 7.6427 by 4:24 p.m. in Johannesburg. Against the euro, the
rand lost 0.7 percent to 9.3704.  
 Stocks and emerging-market currencies strengthened after a
report showed European industrial production increased more than
economists forecast in April, adding to signs the region’s
economy may weather the sovereign debt crisis. U.S.  consumer
sentiment  rose to its highest since January 2008, a report late
on June 11 showed.  
 “As long as the global economic recovery holds up then the
rand will remain generally quite firm,” said  John Cairns , head
of foreign-exchange research at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg.  
 Industrial output  in the 16-member euro zone rose 0.8
percent from March, the European Union’s  statistics office  in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had projected a gain of 0.5
percent, the median of 33 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey 
showed.  
 The rand held gains even after  consumer confidence  in
Africa’s biggest economy fell in the second quarter, according
to a report. The FNB/BER  consumer confidence  index retreated to
14 from 15 in the first three months of the year,  First National
Bank  and the  Bureau for Economic Research  said today.  
 Bonds, Forward-Rate Agreements  
 Government bonds rose, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 gaining 6 cents to 123.21 rand. The
yield on the bond fell 2 basis points to 7.98 percent.  
 Investors maintained bets that the South African Reserve
Bank’s monetary policy committee will reduce the  benchmark
lending rate  when it next meets on July 22, forward-rate
agreements showed. The cost of  three-month contracts  for cash in
three months was steady at 6.40 percent. The rate reached a 6
1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.
