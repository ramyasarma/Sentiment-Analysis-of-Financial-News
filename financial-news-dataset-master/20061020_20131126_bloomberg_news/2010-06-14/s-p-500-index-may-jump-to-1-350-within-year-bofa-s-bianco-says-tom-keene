             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  will
rally as much as 23 percent to 1,350 over the next 12 months,
propelled by corporate profit growth, according to  David Bianco ,
head of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  
 The equity gauge will climb as high as 1,200 in the second
quarter and trade in a range of 1,050 to 1,300 through the end
of the year, he said in a radio interview with  Tom Keene  on
“Bloomberg Surveillance.” Bianco said other analysts are too
pessimistic in forecasting the S&P won’t match its record high
of 1,565.15, reached in October 2007, in the next several years.  
 “Many investors think we won’t see that high for another
decade or so, and I think that’s incorrect -- we will see those
highs and higher within the next handful of years,” said
Bianco, based in New York. “What we see is corporate profit
growth in a very low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment.”  
 The Federal Reserve will keep its target rate at a record
low until August 2011, and yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries
will remain at or below 5 percent for the next two to three
years, according to Bianco.  
 The  S&P 500  climbed for a third day, increasing 1 percent
to 1,102.71 at 12:23 p.m. in New York. The  yield  on 10-year
Treasury note advanced 0.08 percentage point to 3.31 percent.  
 The S&P 500 will benefit from profit growth in businesses
in emerging markets, Bianco said. China’s companies, which now
account for 5 percent of profits on the S&P, will contribute 20
percent by 2015, he said.  
 Analysts have raised their average 2010 earnings growth
forecasts for the S&P 500 to 32 percent from 26 percent at the
end of March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
