             PSG Group Ltd. , a South African
brokerage firm, started a reorganization of its asset-management
units in a bid to double funds under administration.  
 “Our aim in the next three years is to have 50 billion
rand in assets under administration with half of those funds
managed internally,” Ross Breedt, head of marketing and sales
for PSG Fund Management, said in a telephone interview from Cape
Town today. “We haven’t factored in any acquisitions. Those
would be a bonus.”  
 PSG Group’s asset-management business has grown from 1
billion rand ($130.7 million) to 24 billion rand in six years.
Should the funds double over three years within a more “focused
and simplified” structure, the company would be one of South
Africa’s 10 largest collective investment-fund managers.  
 PSG Group was unchanged at 24.50 rand as of 3:09 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading.
