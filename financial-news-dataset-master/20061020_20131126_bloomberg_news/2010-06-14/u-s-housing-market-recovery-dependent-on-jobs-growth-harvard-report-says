-- U.S. Housing Market Recovery Dependent on Jobs Growth, Harvard Report Says

             Job growth will be the key factor in
whether the U.S. real estate market can extend a  recovery  after
the end of the federal homebuyer tax credit, according to a
Harvard University study.  
 High unemployment is fueling the foreclosure crisis and
discouraging the household formation that drives property
demand, according to the State of the Nation’s Housing report
issued today by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. The
weak labor market resulted in people “doubling up,” or sharing
residences, rather than buying their own home, the report said.  
 “What happens with jobs will matter the most to the
strength of the housing rebound,” said  Eric Belsky , executive
director for the center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “If
employment growth surprises on the upside or downside, housing
numbers could too.”  
 The U.S. unemployment  rate  dropped to 9.7 percent last
month from 9.9 percent in April, the Labor Department said June
4. For all of 2010, it probably will be 9.6 percent, the highest
for any year since 1983, according to the average estimate of 82
economists polled by Bloomberg.  
 The homebuyer tax  credit  of as much as $8,000 required
buyers to have a signed contract by April 30 and close on a
property by July 1. The credit resulted in 1 million additional
home sales between February 2009, when it began, and its
expiration this year, according to  Lawrence Yun , chief economist
of the Chicago-based National Association of Realtors.  
 Consumer confidence now needs to improve for the market to
sustain itself, he said in an interview. The percentage of
 consumers  who planned to buy a home in the next six months fell
to 1.9 percent in May after touching a seven-month high of 2.8
percent in March, the New York-based Conference Board said in a
report last month.  
 ‘Self-Fulfilling Prophecy’  
 “It comes down to whether consumers perceive that the
market has bottomed or if they continue to wait,” Yun said.
“If they wait, it pushes the market down and becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy.”  
 Mounting foreclosures are another headwind for a real
estate recovery, according to the Harvard report. There were 2.1
million loans in the  foreclosure  process in the first quarter,
almost quadruple the number from three years ago.  
 “The foreclosure trend is going to get worse before it
gets better,”  Thomas Lawler , an independent housing consultant
in Leesburg, Virginia, said in an interview. “The biggest risk
for housing is that you’ll see more foreclosed homes hitting the
market and not have an offsetting rebound in household formation
triggered by a recovering jobs market.”
