             Asian stocks  rose to the highest
level in almost four weeks as improving sentiment among U.S.
consumers boosted speculation that demand for products and
resources will increase in the world’s biggest economy.  
 Sony Corp. , an electronics maker that gets 21 percent of
its revenue in the U.S., climbed 1.8 percent in Tokyo after an
index of U.S. consumer confidence released June 11 climbed to
the highest level in more than two years. Samsung Electronics
Co., Asia’s biggest semiconductor maker, gained 1.3 percent on
the outlook for chip demand.  Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, climbed 4 percent after most workers at an
affiliate’s factory in China agreed to end a strike.  
 “U.S. economic data remain resilient, and economies
continue to improve globally,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.,
which oversees more than $65 billion.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 1.5 percent to 114.08 as
of 7:23 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its highest close since May 19.
Almost seven shares gained for each that dropped. The gauge has
slumped 12 percent from its high this year on April 15 on
concern Greece and other European countries will struggle to
curb their budget deficits or repay debt, denting a global
economic recovery.  
 Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.8 percent to
9,879.85, the biggest gain among equity benchmarks in the Asia-
Pacific region. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and South Korea’s
Kospi Index increased 0.9 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index advanced
1.2 percent. Markets in Australia, China and the Philippines
were closed today for holidays.  
 Dwelling on Negatives  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.8
percent. The  index  rose 0.4 percent on June 11 as National
Semiconductor Corp. spurred a rally in technology shares and the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment advanced to 75.5 in June, the highest level
since January 2008.  
 Europe’s government debt crisis has created an environment
in which investors are dwelling on negative developments even
when data show economic recovery, the Bank for International
Settlements said.  
 “Investors have been concerned about a double-dip
recession in the U.S. later this year,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka ,
a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The
report on consumer sentiment showed it is less likely to be the
case as the economy continues to recover.”  
 Valuations, Exporters  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has fallen about 5.3 percent
this year, driving down the average price of stocks in the gauge
to 14.7 times  estimated earnings . The ratio sank to 13.8 times
on May 18, the lowest level since December 2008.  
 Honda , which gets 42 percent of its sales in North America,
rose 4 percent to 2,711 yen and was the biggest contributor to
the MSCI index’s advance. Sony gained 1.8 percent to 2,618 yen.
Panasonic Corp. increased 3.2 percent to 1,259 yen. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s No. 1 carmaker, climbed 1.2 percent to 3,255
yen.  
 Hyundai Motor Co., which expanded its U.S. market share in
May, rose 3.3 percent to 142,000 won. The carmaker also advanced
after China extended subsidies for trading in used vehicles and
LIG Investment & Securities Co. raised its estimate on the
automaker’s share price by 20 percent.  
 Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. , which makes nearly all of
its revenue in China, surged 5.3 percent to HK$2.58 in Hong Kong.
Dongfeng Motor Group Co. jumped 6.8 percent to HK$8.66.  
 The group that includes makers of electronics and cars
advanced the most among the 10  industry groups  in the MSCI index,
followed by information-technology companies.  
 Chip Stocks Climb  
 Semiconductor stocks climbed after National Semiconductor
forecast first-quarter sales on June 11 that exceeded the
average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Chip stocks
rallied that day after the Semiconductor Industry Association
raised its outlook for global chip sales this year.  
 Samsung Electronics gained 1.3 percent to 807,000 won.
 Elpida Memory Inc. , Japan’s bigger maker of computer-memory
chips, advanced 2.5 percent to 1,753 yen. Toshiba Corp., which
gets about 15 percent of revenue from semiconductors, increased
2.2 percent to 470 yen.  
 Posco, Asia’s third-biggest steelmaker, climbed 1.6 percent
to 473,000 won after the Seoul Economic Daily said the company
plans to raise prices. Posco isn’t considering price
“adjustments” now, spokesman  Choi Doo Jin  told Bloomberg News
today by telephone.  
 Korea Gas Corp. , the world’s biggest buyer of liquefied
natural gas, rose 1.8 percent to 44,800 won. The company said
sales jumped for a seventh month as the economic recovery
boosted demand for the fuel from power producers. Sales rose 53
percent to 1.89 million metric tons in May.  
 Commodities, Real Estate  
 Mitsui & Co. , which gets about 29 percent of sales from
commodities, gained 1.8 percent to 1,112 yen in Tokyo.  Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer of the metal,
climbed 2.8 percent to HK$6.27. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s
biggest producer of the metal, rose 1.2 percent to HK$14.88.  
 The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
nickel and zinc advanced for a fourth day on June 11 with a 0.9
percent climb. Copper futures for July delivery rose as much as
2.6 percent today, extending their gain to a fifth session.  
 Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. soared 7.4 percent to
10,050 won, leading increases among South Korean builders after
the Seoul Economic Daily said the government may announce
measures to boost property markets late this month. GS
Engineering & Construction Corp. rose 5.2 percent to 81,000 won.  
 Mitsubishi Estate Co. , Japan’s second-largest developer,
increased 2.2 percent to 1,342 yen. Tokyu Land Corp. jumped 5.2
percent to 347 yen. Both stocks had their investment ratings
raised to “outperform” from “neutral” by Credit Suisse Group
AG, saying markets for office buildings and condominiums will
improve.
