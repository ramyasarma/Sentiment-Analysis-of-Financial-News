             Financial companies  will displace
computer and software makers as the largest industry in the
Russell 3000 after the addition of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. when
the index rebalances this month.  
 The insurance and investment company run by billionaire
 Warren Buffett  is set to be added to the Russell 3000 and
Russell 1000, according to the Tacoma, Washington-based Russell
Investments’  website . Berkshire is one of 38 financial companies
on the preliminary list. Russell will review and update the
additions June 18 and again on June 25 before they take effect.  
 Banks and financial firms will account for 19 percent of
the index, up from 15.3 percent last year, making it the biggest
increase by industry based on market value. Berkshire will also
account for about 1.1 percent of the rebalanced Russell 1000 and
will rank in its top 20 companies, according to New York-based
Investment Technology Group Inc., which monitors and analyzes
changes in indexes for its institutional clients.  
 “It reflects the recapitalization of the financial sector,
as many of the companies in that sector over the last two years
either failed, merged or declined,” said  Eric Teal , who
oversees about $4.5 billion as chief investment officer at First
Citizens BancShares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina. “As the
sector has stabilized, benchmarks are adding new constituents.
It’s a theme with financials, there are similar moves occurring
in the S&P benchmarks.”  
 Technology vs. Financial  
 Russell plans to add 47 technology stocks, increasing the
sector’s market value to $2.23 trillion and accounting for 16.7
percent of the index. While nine fewer financial companies will
be added, the industry will see a 57 percent gain in value to
$2.54 trillion. That will give the sector the largest chunk of
the index at 19 percent.  
 Berkshire Hathaway’s Class B shares became more affordable
after the company’s 50-for-1  stock split  in January. The Class B
shares now trade at $74.92, compared to the $3,340 before the
split. Berkshire Hathaway, the fifth-largest U.S. company with a
market value of $185.9 billion, replaced Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  on Feb. 12.  
 The Russell 3000 represents the 3,000 largest U.S.-based
companies, while the Russell 1000 is made up of the largest
third of those companies. The indexes are reconstituted each
year by ranking U.S. stocks by equity value as of May 28.  
 26 Percent Growth  
 There are 262 preliminary stocks designated for addition to
the Russell 3000, with 47 technology firms accounting for the
most by sector, according to the number of companies. The total
market capitalization is set to grow 26 percent to $13.4
trillion. Energy companies account for the only sector that will
see a decline in market capitalization this year, falling 0.8
percent to $1.26 trillion.  Exxon Mobil Corp.  remains the largest
company by market value.  
 Companies that are added to the index tend to outperform
those taken out on the day of the rebalancing, according to ITG.
Last year, additions beat deletions by almost 22 percent on the
day the changes went into place. That may help bring speculators
back to the market this year as they hope for another wide
spread, said ITG.  
 The Russell 3000 Index has fallen 1.2 percent, while the
Russell 1000 has fallen 1.7 percent in 2010,  compared  with the
2.3 percent drop by the S&P 500. The Russell 2000 has rallied
4.3 percent.
