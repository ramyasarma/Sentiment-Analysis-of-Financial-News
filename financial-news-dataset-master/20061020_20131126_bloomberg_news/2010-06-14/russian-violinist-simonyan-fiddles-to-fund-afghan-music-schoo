             Last year,  Mikhail Simonyan  read an
article about how Afghan youths were deprived of music
instruction under the  Taliban . The Russian violinist could
recall stories about artistic expression being stifled in his
own country.  
 So six months ago Simonyan launched  Beethoven Not Bullets ,
a nonprofit, to help raise money for the  Afghanistan National
Institute of Music .  
 “A society without music and culture is empty,” Simonyan,
25, said in an interview from his New York home. “This is about
the education of a generation. Music is the key to their
success.”  
 Simonyan, who was 13 when he made his debut at New York’s
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, will gather with friends
from the  New York Philharmonic  tonight at  City Winery  to raise
money for Afghan music school. His performance is part of a
classical showcase produced by  Music Unites , a New York
nonprofit that helps needy students get music instruction.  
 Simonyan will perform Schumann’s Piano Quartet in G Minor
for piano, violin, viola and cello. He’ll also perform the
Handel/ Johan Halvorsen  Passacaglia in G Minor for Violin and
Viola and a work by the Russian violinist and composer Nathan
Milstein.  
 The $30 ticket price will be used to fund instruction at
the Afghan music school, which costs $360 per student, Simonyan
said. Run by  Ahmad Sarmast , the school teaches Afghan and
Western classical music, as well as basic educational courses.  
 Pitch to Prince  
 “There is a lack of money to support culture in
Afghanistan,” Simonyan said. “With the collapse of the Taliban
regime, the country is rebuilding, but they’re not focused on
rebuilding the culture.”  
 Simonyan said Beethoven Not Bullets has raised about $7,000
from friends and musicians, including  Liang Wang,  the
Philharmonic’s principal oboist.  
 This week, Simonyan plans to solicit support from  Prince Charles  after a private solo performance at Buckingham Palace
for  Queen Elizabeth . The prince, who oversees  several family
charities , met Simonyan earlier this year.  
 “Prince Charles is a musician who plays cello, he’s a
colleague in a sense,” Simonyan said. “To get him involved would
be absolutely amazing for me and the kids in Afghanistan.”  
 Simonyan performs tonight at City Winery, 155 Varick St.
