             Siemens AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  said the company’s “underlying commercial
performance” shows “we are either level or have surpassed
what” General Electric Co. “is doing”, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview.  
 Concerns over possible contagion from Greece’s financial
crisis have been “overdone,” the newspaper also cited him as
saying.
