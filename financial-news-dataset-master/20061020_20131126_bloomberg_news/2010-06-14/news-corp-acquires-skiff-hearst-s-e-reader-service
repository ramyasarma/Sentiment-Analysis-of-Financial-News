             News Corp. , the owner of the Wall
Street Journal, boosted its investment in digital journalism
with the acquisition of Skiff LLC, Hearst Corp.’s e-reading
service, which transmits news articles to portable devices.  
 Skiff delivers newspapers and magazines to devices such as
tablets, smartphones and e-readers, New York-based News Corp.
said today in a statement. The company also announced an
investment in  Journalism Online LLC , a venture that helps
publishers collect revenue from online readers. Terms weren’t
disclosed for either deal.  
 News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  is pushing his newspapers, including the Times of London
and the New York Post, to join the Journal in charging consumers
for access to articles on the Web. Murdoch has become an
advocate for pay walls across the journalism industry and has
also criticized  Amazon.com Inc. ’s Kindle for taking too big a
share of the revenue from publishers.  
 The reader Skiff had been developing to compete with the
Kindle and Apple Inc.’s iPad, isn’t part of the purchase, News
Corp. spokeswoman Julie Henderson said.  
 Journalism Online, co-founded by  Steven Brill  and  Gordon Crovitz , runs Press+, a service that provides online readers a
universal account to access news. It also helps publishers
adjust pricing and offerings for paid access to their content,
including managing the so-called meter model, which grants free
access until a reader surpasses a certain threshold.  
 Jon Housman , an adviser at the company, was named president
of News Corp.’s digital journalism efforts, reporting to  Jon Miller , the chief digital officer.  
 News Corp. fell 25 cents to $13.12 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market  trading . The shares have fallen 4.2 percent this
year.
