             Club Mediterranee SA  rose the most
since August in Paris trading after China’s Fosun International
Ltd. acquired a 7.1 percent stake and formed an alliance with
the French company to open resorts in China.  
 Club Med gained as much as 1.50 euros, or 12 percent, to
14.10 euros, and traded at 13.59 euros as of 10 a.m. local time,
heading for its highest close since April 16. The  stock  has
risen 5.5 percent this year, giving the company a market value
of about 387 million euros ($471 million).  
 The five resorts that Club Med and Fosun plan to set up
would open by 2015, the companies said in a statement yesterday.
Club Med aims to increase its number of Chinese customers to
200,000 by 2015 from 23,000 last year, making the country its
second-largest market, the Paris-based resorts operator said.  
 Fosun acquired 628,295 Club Med shares and 1,616,551
mandatory convertible bonds, the Shanghai-based investment
company said in a separate statement yesterday. Neither
announcement provided a value for the transaction.
