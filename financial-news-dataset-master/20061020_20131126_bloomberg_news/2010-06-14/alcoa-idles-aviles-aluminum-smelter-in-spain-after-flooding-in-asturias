             Alcoa Inc. , the largest U.S.
aluminum maker, temporarily idled a smelter and declared force
majeure on shipments from the plant after floods in Spain’s
Asturias region late last week.  
 The Aviles plant, the electrical substation that supplies
its power, and the surrounding region experienced “severe”
flooding, New York-based Alcoa said in a statement today.  
 Aviles has a production capacity of 93,000 metric tons of
aluminum a year. The plant will be idled while the company
cleans up and assesses flood damage, Alcoa said. Employees
mitigated some of the flood’s impact by raising anodes from the
smelter’s so-called pots.  
 Aluminum is typically smelted by separating alumina in
pots, using electricity that’s conducted via carbon anodes.
Force majeure is a contractual clause that allows companies to
miss deliveries because of circumstances beyond their control.
