             Crude oil advanced in New York to
trade around $75 on speculation growth in the U.S. economy will
boost fuel demand from the world’s biggest energy consumer.  
 Oil climbed for the fourth time in five days before reports
this week that may show U.S. factories churned out more goods
last month and the cost of living declined. These could point to
a manufacturing-led recovery without inflation, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. The dollar dropped to its
lowest level in a week against the euro, bolstering the
investment appeal of commodities.  
 “Fundamentals are getting better and the euro is also
driving the crude market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity
derivative sales manager at Newedge in Tokyo. “On the downside,
the market is well-supported above $73 at the moment.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose as much as $1.47, or 2
percent, to $75.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $74.95 at 8:55
a.m. London time. Brent crude oil for July delivery rose 93
cents to $75.28 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities increased
in May for the 10th time in 11 months, according to the median
estimate from 63 economists polled by Bloomberg News before
Federal Reserve figures due June 16. Consumer prices probably
declined 0.2 percent in May, after slipping 0.1 percent the
previous month, the survey showed.  
 Weaker Dollar  
 The dollar declined against the euro for the fourth time in
five days. The single European currency gained as much as 0.8
percent to $1.2208, the highest since June 4.  
 Oil fell 2.3 percent on June 11 after the Commerce
Department said U.S. retail sales decreased 1.2 percent in May,
the biggest drop since September.  
 Concerns about the viability of the U.S. economic rebound
have led hedge funds to cut their bets on higher oil-futures
prices to a 10-month low.  
 Speculative  net-long positions , or wagers that prices will
increase, in crude futures declined 30 percent to 17,457
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the week ended
June 8, the lowest level since July, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders Report
released on June 11. Bets on gains have dropped 87 percent since
reaching a record 135,669 in January.
