             The  U.S. Supreme Court  agreed to
review an order that would require California to reduce its
prison population by 46,000 within two years to ease
overcrowding.  
 Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  and a group of Republican
state lawmakers contend that the lower court order conflicts
with a federal law aimed at reducing prison litigation. The
three-judge panel said the reduction is needed to remedy the
constitutionally inadequate level of medical and mental health
care inmates are receiving.  
 Under a plan submitted by the state in January, California
would use county jails and home detention to alleviate the
overcrowding. California, the nation’s most populous state, is
facing a $19 billion budget deficit.  
 The case is Schwarzenegger v. Plata, 09-1233.
