             Globe Specialty Metals Inc. , a maker
of silicon, rose the most in six months after Eagle Capital
Partners’  Meryl Witmer  made the company a top stock pick in a
Barron’s roundtable because of rising silicon prices.  
 Globe rose 71 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $11.02 at 12:20
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of the
New York-based company earlier increased 10 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Dec. 7.  
 Economic growth in developing countries is spurring price
gains for silicon metals and alloys, Witmer, general partner at
Eagle Capital in New York, said in the June 14 edition of
 Barron’s . The metal is in short supply because competitors are
facing electricity shortages and cost increases in China and
Venezuela, she said.
