             Japan’s 10-year yields were near a
one-week high after stocks gained and a report showed sentiment
among large manufacturers improved, adding to signs the
nation’s economic recovery remains on track.  
 Demand for the relative safety of government debt also
waned on speculation primary dealers will cut their debt
holdings to prepare for a sale of 20-year bonds this week. The
Bank of Japan is forecast to keep interest rates on hold at the
end of a two-day policy meeting starting today.  
 “I remain optimistic about Japan’s economic
fundamentals,” said  Akihiko Inoue , chief market analyst in
Tokyo at Mizuho Investors Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s
second-largest bank. “Bonds have been overbought and yields
are bound to go up.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 rose half
a basis point to 1.235 percent at 10:13 a.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.045 yen to 100.578 yen.  
 The yield touched 1.245 percent on June 11, the highest
since June 4. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery dropped 0.01
to 140.33 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  rose 1.7 percent and the Topix index gained 1.3 percent.  
 Ten-year yields may rise to 1.4 percent by the end of
September, according to Mizuho Investors’ Inoue. Should his
forecast prove accurate, investors who buy the securities today
will incur a 1.1 percent loss, Bloomberg calculations show.  
 Sentiment Improves  
 An index of sentiment among Japan’s large manufacturers
increased to 10 points in the current quarter, up from 4.3
points last quarter, the government said in Tokyo today. The
survey asks respondents whether conditions improved from the
previous quarter, and a positive number means optimists
outnumber pessimists.  
 The Ministry of Finance will sell 1.1 trillion yen ($12
billion) of 20-year bonds on June 16. Primary dealers, which
are required to bid at government debt sales, often reduce
holdings of bonds in case prices decline before they can pass
on the new securities to investors.  
 The central bank will keep the benchmark interest rate at
0.1 percent tomorrow, according to all 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.
