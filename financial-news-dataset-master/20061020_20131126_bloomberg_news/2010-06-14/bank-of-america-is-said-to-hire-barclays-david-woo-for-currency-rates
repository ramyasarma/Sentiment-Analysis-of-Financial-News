             Bank of America Merrill Lynch hired
 David Woo  from Barclays Plc to head Group of 10 foreign-exchange
and interest-rate research, according to two people with
knowledge of the appointment.  
 Woo, formerly a managing director at Barclays Capital, will
start at Bank of America in New York in August, the people said
under condition of anonymity because the hire has yet to be made
public. Woo’s role, covering both currencies and rates, is a new
one for Bank of America, which previously split the job between
two people.  Steve Pearson , former head of Group of 10 currency
research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, left the company in
March.  
 The Merrill Lynch unit helped  Bank of America Corp.  post
net income of $3.18 billion in the first three months of 2010,
its first profit in three quarters. Sales and trading revenue
hit a record $7 billion in the first quarter, the bank said in
April. Merrill Lynch’s results more than erased losses tied to
home lending.  
 Woo will report to  Candace Browning , head of research at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, the people said. He
will work next to  Daniel Tenengauzer , head of emerging-markets
foreign-exchange and rates strategy.  
 A spokesman for Bank of America in London declined to
comment. Woo couldn’t immediately be reached on his mobile
phone.  
 The biggest difference in yields between two- and 10-year
U.S. Treasuries since at least 1990 helped fixed-income traders
generate record revenue as they borrowed short-dated securities
and bought longer-dated bonds. The  spread  widened to a record
291 basis points on Feb. 22, and was at 255 basis points today.
The median since 1991 was 105 basis points.

                          Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- David Woo, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Barclays Capital, talks with Bloomberg's Scarlet Fu about the outlook for the dollar and factors contributing to its market valuation.
     Woo also discusses the euro, the possible impact of European Central Bank and Bank of England monetary policy on investor sentiment and the performance of some emerging market currencies. (Source: Bloomberg)
