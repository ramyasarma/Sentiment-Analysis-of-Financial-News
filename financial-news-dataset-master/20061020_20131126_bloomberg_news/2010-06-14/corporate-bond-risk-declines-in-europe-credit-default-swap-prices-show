             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 16
basis points to 580, according to Markit Group Ltd. prices at
7:20 a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline indicates
improvements in the perception of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 4.5 basis points to 125, Markit
prices show.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
