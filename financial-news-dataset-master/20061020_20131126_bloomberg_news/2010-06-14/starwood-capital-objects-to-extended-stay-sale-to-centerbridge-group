             Starwood Capital Group, which lost
an auction for  Extended Stay Inc. , said it will continue to
compete for the hotel chain and try to defeat a planned sale to
Centerbridge Partners LP, Paulson & Co. and  Blackstone Group.   
 Starwood said in a court filing yesterday that the deal
undervalues Extended Stay. It said it plans to seek a judge’s
permission to propose a competing plan to restructure the hotel
company and take it out of bankruptcy.  
 “Creditors should be given an opportunity to vote on each
of the plans and select the plan that they believe results in
the highest and best recovery,” Starwood said.  
 Starwood lost the bidding for Extended Stay at a May 27
auction. The Centerbridge group won the auction with a
$3.9 billion offer. The Centerbridge bid, which requires court
approval, would give the group full ownership of Extended Stay’s
more than 600 hotels.  
 Starwood said in its court filing that Spartanburg, South
Carolina-based Extended Stay could be worth as much as
$5.2 billion. It said certain auction rules chilled bidding for
the company.  
 Lawyers for Extended Stay and the Centerbridge Group
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment yesterday.  
 The case is In re Extended Stay Inc., 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
