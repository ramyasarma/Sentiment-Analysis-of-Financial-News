             South Africa’s Richards Bay, the
world’s second-biggest coal export harbor, boosted sales to
India by 12 percent in May, a trader said.  
 Exports of the fuel rose to 1.93 million metric tons last
month from 1.72 million in April, according to a note by 
 mjunction Services Ltd. , a Web-based trader backed by India’s 
biggest steel producers. The coal shipped was mostly thermal, 
used in power plants to generate electricity.  
 The terminal exported 4.57 million tons of coal in May, up
from April’s 3.91 million tons and 22 percent more than a year
earlier even as deliveries were cut by an 18-day national port
and rail strike that ended on May 28. At the shipment rate so
far this year, the terminal will export 57.72 million tons of
the fuel in 2010, about 64 percent of its capacity.  
 Buyers from India accounted for about 42 percent of the
terminal’s exports in May, according to the note. India’s
imports of power-plant coal may grow 14 percent a year as demand
for electricity increases, according to Tata Power Ltd.  
 Pakistan’s coal imports fell by about 69 percent to 40,233
tons in May from April, mJunction said. The South Asian nation
imported 2.97 million tons in the first five months from
Richards Bay terminal.  
 India imported 8.33 million tons in the first five months
of this year from Richards Bay, 18.7 percent higher than the
year-earlier period, according to the note. Richards Bay shipped
about 35 percent of its total coal to India this year until May.  
 The country, Asia’s largest economy after Japan and China,
expanded its industrial output by 17.6 percent in April,
boosting its consumption of electricity as factories stepped up
production. The nation’s thermal coal imports may climb to 72
million metric tons in 2011, according to Tata Power.  
 Prices for coal shipped through Richards Bay fell 0.4
percent to an average of $92.41 a ton on a free-on-board basis
in the four days through June 4, according to IHS McCloskey.
Asian benchmark prices at the port of Newcastle in Australia
rose 1.2 percent to $99.30 through June 11.
