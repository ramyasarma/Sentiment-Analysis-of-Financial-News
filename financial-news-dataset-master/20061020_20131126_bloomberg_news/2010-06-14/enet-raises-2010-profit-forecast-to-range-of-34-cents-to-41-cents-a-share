             Tenet Healthcare Corp. , the third-
largest publicly traded U.S. hospital chain, said it raised its
2010  earnings  forecast to a range of 34 cents to 41 cents per
share excluding certain items.  
 Tenet previously forecast per share earnings of 24 cents to
32 cents, the Dallas-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts estimated 27 cents a share, according to a Bloomberg
 survey  of 20 analysts.  
 The company lowered its forecast for 2010 operating
expenses by $50 million to reflect reduced costs for labor,
information technology and malpractice expenses, Chief Executive
Officer  Trevor Fetter  said in the statement. Tenet, which owns
49 U.S. medical facilities, said last week it had ended a
preliminary effort to bid for Healthscope Ltd, Australia’s
second-largest hospital operator.  
 “Continuing improvements in cost efficiencies are driving
an improved earnings picture,” Fetter said in the statement.  
 Tenet’s shares rose 14 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $5.20 at
5:22 p.m. in extended trading on the New York Stock Exchange
after falling 1 cent to close at $5.06.
