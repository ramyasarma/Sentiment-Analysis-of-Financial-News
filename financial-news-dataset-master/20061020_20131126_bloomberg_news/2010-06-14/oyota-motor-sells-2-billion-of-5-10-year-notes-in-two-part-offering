             Toyota Motor Corp. ’s U.S. finance
unit sold $2 billion of 5- and 10-year notes, the first such
sale in the U.S. by the world’s largest automaker in four years.  
 Toyota Motor Credit Corp. yesterday issued $1.25 billion of
five-year notes that yield 120 basis points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, and $750 million of 10-year debt with
a spread of 130 basis points, Bloomberg data show. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “We always try to keep a diverse source of funding,” said
 Justin Leach , a spokesman for the finance unit in Torrance,
California. “It had been a while since we were in the market,
and the timing was right.”  
 The sale is Toyota’s first benchmark offering of dollar-
denominated debt since 2006 and comes after the Toyota City,
Japan-based company recalled more than 8 million vehicles
worldwide this year to fix sticky gas pedals and misshapen floor
mats.  
 Funds raised from the sale aren’t earmarked for a specific
program, Leach said, without elaborating.  
 Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is also based in Torrance.
