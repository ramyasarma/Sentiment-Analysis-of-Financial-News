             U.S. stocks halted a global rally as
Greece’s credit rating was cut and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index failed to hold above levels watched by traders who base
investment decisions on charts. Treasuries pared losses, while
the euro rallied on signs the region’s economy is strengthening.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent to 1,089.63 at 4 p.m. in New
York after gaining 1.3 percent earlier to 1,105.91, near its
200-day average of about 1,108.  The MSCI World Index  of stocks
in 24 developed nations advanced 1 percent for a fifth
consecutive gain, its longest streak since October. Ten-year
Treasury yields rose 2 basis points to 3.26 percent after
jumping 9 basis points earlier. The euro climbed 0.9 percent to
top $1.22.  
 Benchmark indexes in the U.S. began paring gains as Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded Greece’s government bond rating to
junk, cutting the grade four levels to Ba1 from A3. Losses in
the S&P 500 accelerated after it slipped below its June 3
closing level of 1,102.83, the day before slower-than-estimated
growth in U.S. jobs sent the gauge down 3.4 percent for its
biggest slump since February.  
 “Greece is not a new story for the market and the Moody’s
downgrade comes after S&P and Fitch, but the market may be
sensitive to new bad news,” said  Stephen Wood , who helps manage
about $179 billion as chief market strategist for Russell
Investments in New York. “We continue to have this tug-of-war
between negative and positive information in the market.”  
 Financial Shares Retreat  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. lost more than
1.5 percent as financial  shares  in the S&P 500 reversed an
earlier 1.1 percent rally.  Newmont Mining Corp.  helped lead raw-
materials producers lower as gold fell for the third time in
four sessions.  
 Gauges of raw-materials producers, financial firms and
energy companies lost at least 0.5 percent to lead declines
among the 10 main industry groups in the S&P 500, which did not
turn negative on the day until the final half hour of trading.  
 “It was a technical move,”  Ryan Detrick , senior technical
analyst at Schaeffer’s in Cincinnati, said of the late-day
retreat. “We have the 200-day moving average for the S&P 500 at
1,108. Buyers are very reluctant to step in. We got Greece
downgraded and there’s a feeling that the uncertainties are
still out there.”  
 U.S. stocks followed European shares higher earlier after
industrial production increased more than economists forecast in
April, rising 0.8 percent for an 11th month of gains, the
European Union said. The Federal Reserve may say on June 16 that
output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities grew 0.9 percent
last month after a 0.8 percent increase in April, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Economic Recovery  
 The S&P 500 climbed 2.5 percent last week as China’s
exports jumped the most in six years, Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic recovery is intact and
commodity prices gained.  
 Analysts have raised their average 2010 earnings growth
forecasts for the S&P 500 to 32 percent from 26 percent at the
end of March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
improving forecasts came even as the benchmark measure of U.S.
equities retreated 13 percent between April 23 and June 4 amid
concern some European nations will struggle to finance deficits.  
 The S&P 500 is  trading  at about 13.4 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next 12 months, near the lowest level
since March 2009, the month the benchmark index slumped to a 12-
year low.  
 Bianco Eyes 1,300  
 “What we see is corporate profit growth in a very low-
inflation, low-interest-rate environment,”  David Bianco , head
of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said
in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with  Tom Keene . “By year-
end, we’ll be at 1,300” for the S&P 500.  
 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard ,
speaking in Tokyo today, said Europe’s debt crisis shouldn’t
cause the Fed to postpone raising interest rates as the economy
recovers. The central bank has kept its benchmark lending rate
at a record-low range near zero since December 2008 to foster
growth.  
 Eighteen of 19 industries in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose, sending the benchmark index up 1.2 percent.     The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index climbed 1.6 percent to the highest in almost four
weeks. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group climbed more than
2.4 percent in London. Axa SA, Europe’s second-biggest insurer,
rose 3.7 percent in Paris after saying it’s in talks to sell
part of its U.K. life insurance unit to  Clive Cowdery ’s
Resolution Ltd. for 2.75 billion pounds ($4 billion).  
 BP Slumps  
 BP Plc , struggling to contain its oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico, slipped 9.3 percent to a 13-year low of 355.45 pence in
London. President  Barack Obama  is demanding an escrow account
for damages claims related to the worst environmental disaster
in the nation’s history.  
 Developing-nation stocks rose for a fifth day, the longest
winning streak in two months, with the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index  gaining 1.4 percent. Benchmark gauges in Taiwan, South
Africa, Thailand and Qatar advanced at least 1.2 percent.  
 The yen dropped against 11 of 16 major currencies, while
the euro strengthened against 11 of 16 and the dollar weakened
against 12.  
 South Korea’s won appreciated 2 percent against the dollar
after policy makers said they will give banks time to meet a new
ceiling on forward contracts, holding off from imposing controls
on capital flows.  
 Commodities Rally  
 Commodity prices jumped to the highest level in a month
amid signs that the improving economy will boost demand for
energy, metals and crops.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose
1.6 percent to 259.98 in New York. Earlier, the gauge reached
260.51, the highest level since May 14. Gold was the only index
component to decline.  
 Copper futures for July delivery rose 8.8 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.992 a pound on the Comex in New York, poised for
the fifth straight gain, the longest rally since early January.
The metal climbed 3 percent last week. Crude oil futures for
July delivery increased 1.8 percent to $75.12 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange after jumping 3 percent earlier.  
 The Belgian 10-year yield jumped 11 basis points to 3.47
percent. Flemish nationalists took the lead in  Belgium ’s general
elections, setting up coalition talks with French-speaking
Socialists who face demands from Dutch-speaking voters to give
more powers to the nation’s regions.  
 The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default fell in
the U.S. and Europe. The Markit CDX North America Investment
Grade Index Series 14, which investors use to hedge against
losses or speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.3 basis
points to a mid-price of 123.1 basis points, according to Markit
Group Ltd.
