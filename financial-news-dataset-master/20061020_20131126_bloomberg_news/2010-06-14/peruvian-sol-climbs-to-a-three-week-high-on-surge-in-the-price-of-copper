             Peru’s sol climbed to its highest
level in three weeks after rising European industrial production
buoyed copper prices, boosting demand for the currency.  
 The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.8418 per U.S. dollar at 12:44
p.m. New York time, from 2.8440 on June 11. The currency earlier
touched 2.8410, the strongest since May 21.  
 Copper is Peru’s biggest export.  
 “The sol is following the positive trend in international
markets, including commodities, which is generating demand for
the currency” said  Antonio Diaz , a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru.
