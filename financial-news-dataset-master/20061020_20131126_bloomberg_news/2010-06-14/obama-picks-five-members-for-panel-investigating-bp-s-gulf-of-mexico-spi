             President  Barack Obama  named five
people to a commission to investigate the  BP Plc  oil spill,
completing a panel charged with determining the causes of the
accident and recommending ways to prevent another such disaster.  
 The five are  Cherry A. Murray , dean of the Harvard School
of Engineering and Applied Sciences; Frances Beinecke, president
of the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council; Donald
Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for
Environmental Science;  Terry D. Garcia , vice president for
mission programs at the National Geographic Society; and Frances

former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to lead
the commission.  
 The president directed the panel to issue a report before
the end of the year.
