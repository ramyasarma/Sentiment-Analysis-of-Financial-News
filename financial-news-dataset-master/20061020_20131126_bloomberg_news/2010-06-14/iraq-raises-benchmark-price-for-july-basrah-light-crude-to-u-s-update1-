             Iraq, holder of the world’s third-
largest oil reserves, raised the official selling price for its
Basrah Light crude grade for July liftings to the U.S. and cut
the price to Asia, the state oil marketing company said today.  
 The discount for Basrah Light crude to the U.S. narrowed to
$1.45 less than the  Argus Sour Crude Index  price for July,
making the grade 10 cents more expensive than in June, the
marketing agency said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The discount to Asia widened for the sixth time in seven
months, reaching $1.10 below the Dubai-Oman benchmark from a
June price of $1.05 off the price published by Platts, the
energy-information division of McGraw-Hill Cos., Iraq said.  
 Iraq raised prices on Basrah Light and Kirkuk crude to
Europe for July. The Basrah Light discount to Europe was cut in
half, reduced to a $2.40 discount to Dated Brent, while the
discount on Kirkuk was lowered by more than half to $1.10 below
Brent for July from $3.30 below the benchmark in June. U.S.
buyers will get Kirkuk at a 15-cent premium to ASCI, unchanged
from a month earlier.  
 Iraq exported 627,000 barrels of crude a day to the U.S. in
2008, representing about 6.4 percent of all U.S. oil imports,
according to data from the  Energy Information Administration .  
 Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, this month
raised the price for July liftings of its Arab Light crude
grades to the U.S. and Europe and cut the price of all light
grades to Asia.
