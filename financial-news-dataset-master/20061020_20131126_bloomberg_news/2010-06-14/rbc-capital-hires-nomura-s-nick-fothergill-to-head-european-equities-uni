             RBC Capital Markets, the corporate
and investment banking arm of Royal Bank of Canada, hired Nick
Fothergill as a managing director and head of European equities.  
 Fothergill joined from Nomura Holdings Inc., where he was a
managing director and head of sales and trading for sector
specialist sales and industry groups, RBC Capital Markets said
in an e-mailed statement today. Fothergill was head of sales and
trading for industrials at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. prior
to that.  
 RBC Capital Markets is expanding its presence in Europe and
has hired 140 people in the region this year, the statement
said. The Canadian lender is seeking to buy an investment bank
in London and has held exploratory talks with possible targets,
the Financial Times reported earlier today, without saying how
it obtained the information.
