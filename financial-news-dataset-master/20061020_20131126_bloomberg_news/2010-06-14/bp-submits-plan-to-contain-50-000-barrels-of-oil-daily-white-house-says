             BP Plc has submitted a new plan to
the Obama administration that would contain more of the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill faster, a White House official said today.  
 Under the new plan, 50,000 barrels of oil could be
contained per day by the end of June, two weeks earlier than
originally suggested, according to the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.  
 BP made the commitment as President  Barack Obama  prepared
to leave the White House this morning for a two-day, three-state
tour of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida to confer with state
and local officials on containment and cleanup efforts.  
 The president is scheduled to address the nation on the
spill and the next steps tomorrow night at 8 p.m. Washington
time. Obama meets June 16 with BP Plc Board Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  and other company officials to press his plan for an
escrow account to pay the claims for damages caused by the oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico, White House adviser  David Axelrod 
said yesterday.
