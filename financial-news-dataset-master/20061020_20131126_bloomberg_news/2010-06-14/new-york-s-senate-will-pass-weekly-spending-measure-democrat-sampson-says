             New York’s Senate will pass an 11th
consecutive weekly emergency spending bill today, avoiding a
shutdown of state government, Senate Democratic leader John
Sampson said.  
 “We’re going to pass the extender and government is going
to continue to operate,” Sampson told reporters in Albany after
meeting with Governor David Paterson and Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver. All three officials are Democrats.  
 “We are moving closer and closer to an overall budget
plan,” Silver said.
