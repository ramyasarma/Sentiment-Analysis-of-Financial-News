             Iran is seeking to remove Russian-
built Tupolev Tu-154 planes from its fleet following a spate of
crashes,  Pool  reported, citing the director of Iran Civil
Aviation Organization, Reza Nakhjavani.  
 U.S. sanctions against Iran are preventing the country from
acquiring the newer Tupolev Tu-204, the Tehran-based newspaper
said. Iran will also find it difficult to get replacement parts
for the Tupolev Tu-154, the newspaper said.  
 In January, 46 people were injured when the tail of a
Tupolev Tu-154 caught fire as the plane landed in the
northeastern city of Mashhad. In July last year, a Tupolev Tu-
154 crashed in the northwestern province of Qazvin on a flight
to Armenia, killing all 168 people on board. In September 2006,
another Tu-154 caught fire and crashed while landing in Mashhad,
killing 27 people.
