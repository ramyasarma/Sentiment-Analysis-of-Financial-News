             Macquarie Group Ltd.  cut its price
estimate for Taiwan real-estate stocks by 20 percent on concern
government tightening and equity declines will slow property
sales in the second half of the year.  
 “After a strong selling pace in the high season in March-
April, we saw the selling pace started to come off in May,”
analyst  Corinne Jian  said in a report dated June 11,
distributed today. “It will become more difficult for housing
prices to increase in the remainder of the year.”  
 Rising property prices has spurred the central bank to
pledge to prevent asset bubbles, while some state-owned lenders
raised mortgage rates and reduced loans for luxury homes. The
island’s  Taiex index  has plunged 10 percent this year, Asia’s
second worst-performer, on concern tightening in China and
Europe’s debt crisis will derail global economic growth.  
 Taiwan’s property sector has outperformed its Chinese peers
by 23 percent in the past 12 months and the net asset value
premium is “far more expensive” than other Asian real-estate
shares, Macquarie said. The brokerage expects the island’s
property developers to “catch up with the underperformance in
the region,” Jian said.  
 The brokerage reduced its 12-month share-price estimate for
Cathay Real Estate Development Co., Taiwan’s second-largest
construction company by value, to NT$11.50 from NT$17, while
lowering its recommendation to “neutral” from “outperform.”
