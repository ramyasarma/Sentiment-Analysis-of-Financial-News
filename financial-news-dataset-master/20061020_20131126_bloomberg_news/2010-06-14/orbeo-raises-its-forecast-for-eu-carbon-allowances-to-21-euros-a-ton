             Orbeo, the carbon-trading venture of
Societe Generale SA and Rhodia SA, raised its 2011 forecast for
EU carbon-dioxide allowances by 2 euros ($2.44) a ton to 21
euros in 2011 amid expectations of an economic recovery.  
 Paris-based Orbeo forecast the price of carbon in the
European Union emissions trading system will rise to 17 euros a
metric ton in the third quarter and to 19 euros in the fourth.  
 “After a relative period of stability, we think that
carbon prices could start rising again, in line with the
progressive yet genuine economic recovery,” Orbeo said in a
research note e-mailed June 11.
