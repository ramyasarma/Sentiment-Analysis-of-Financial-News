             Johnson & Johnson’s  McNeil Consumer
Healthcare president recommended a recall of faulty Motrin pills
without notifying regulators or consumers, according to a person
familiar with a congressional probe of the company.  
 Peter Luther, whose unit produced the Motrin tablets in
2008, told McNeil employees in an e-mail to go ahead with a
“market withdraw of Motrin,” writing, “Let’s make this happen
ASAP.” The e-mail was obtained by Bloomberg from the person
familiar with the investigation by the House  Oversight and
Government Reform Committee .  
 The probe into the Motrin tablets, which didn’t dissolve
properly, began in May as part of an inquiry into children’s
medicines  recalled  April 30 by McNeil because of manufacturing
defects.  Colleen Goggins , J&J’s consumer group chairman, told a
May 27 committee hearing that the company hadn’t intended to
mislead anyone about the Motrin incident. Contractors were hired
to buy pills, emptying store shelves without announcing a
recall, the person familiar with the investigation said.  
 “The FDA was kept fully informed of McNeil’s plans and
actions throughout the process,”  Bonnie Jacobs , a spokeswoman
for J&J’s McNeil unit, said in a phone interview. “The memo you
referenced is consistent with what we have stated previously.”  
 Luther has been McNeil’s president since January 2009, she
said.  
 Go Ahead  
 A May 27, 2009, e-mail from Luther in response to a
discussion among McNeil executives about whether to go ahead
with the plan to buy the Motrin in stores expressed concern
about the expense of the contractors hired by the company, the
person said.  
 “Given our current financial situation, I hope we’re not
going to really double our cost to do this,” Luther said in the
e-mail to six McNeil employees, according to the person familiar
with the investigation.  
 The e-mails show that senior McNeil executives were
involved with the plan to buy back the defective Motrin in large
quantities, the person said, and not just perform a sampling of
whether the product made it into stores, as Goggins said in
testimony.  
 There was no safety risk from the faulty Motrin tablets,
J&J said.  
 ‘Unique’ Outlets  
 “The objective was to remove the affected product from a
unique distribution channel, namely convenience stores and gas
stations, with as little disruption and consumer confusion as
possible,” Jacobs said. “The FDA was kept informed of the
survey and product retrieval, and after it was essentially
complete, the FDA requested that we conduct an additional step,
which was to conduct a formal recall, and we agreed.”  
 McNeil told the FDA it would “sample” from stores where
the Motrin had been sent, Meghan Scott, a spokeswoman for the
agency, said on June 11.  
 “They did not inform the agency that they would instruct
contractors to go into stores, ‘act like a regular customer,’
and buy all of the product in question,” Scott said in an e-
mail. The agency didn’t respond immediately today to a new
request for comment.  
 J&J fell 4 cents to $58.42 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The  shares  have fallen 9.1 percent since the
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company announced the April 30
recall of 40 children’s medicines.
