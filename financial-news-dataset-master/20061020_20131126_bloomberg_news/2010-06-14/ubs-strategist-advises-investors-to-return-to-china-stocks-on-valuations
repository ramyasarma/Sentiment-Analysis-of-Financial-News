             Investors should return to Chinese
stocks traded in the domestic and Hong Kong markets because of
their valuations and the outlook for growth, UBS AG strategist
John Tang said.  
 “For the A-share as well as H-Share market, now definitely
is the time to go back in,” Tang said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “The valuation is about 7 percent lower than the 10-
year average, while on the other side, growth is about 60
percent higher,” he also said, referring to the MSCI China
Index.  
 UBS favors bank and technology stocks, Tang also said.
