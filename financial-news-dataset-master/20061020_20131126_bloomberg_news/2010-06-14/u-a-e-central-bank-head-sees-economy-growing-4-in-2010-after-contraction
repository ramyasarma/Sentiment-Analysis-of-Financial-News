             The United Arab Emirates economy may
grow an average 4 percent in 2010 and 2011 as the government
embarks on nuclear power generation and railway projects,
central bank Governor  Sultan Bin Nasser al-Suwaidi  said.  
 “These projects are expected to add value and help expand
other economic sectors,” al-Suwaidi said at a conference in
Singapore today.  
 The U.A.E., among the four biggest oil producers in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is turning to
nuclear power as infrastructure expansion and industrialization
use up domestic natural-gas supplies. It awarded a 75 billion-
dirham ($20 billion) contract in December to a group led by
 Korea Electric Power Corp . to build nuclear power plants.  
 Union Railway Co., which is building the U.A.E’s first
train service, plans to start operating a link between Ruwais,
an oil port and industrial city on Abu Dhabi’s Persian Gulf
coast, to Habshan, where the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has
production and processing facilities, in 2013, Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Bowker  said May 11.  
 The U.A.E economy may expand as much as 3.2 percent this
year with crude oil prices at about $85 a barrel, Economy
Minister  Sultan bin Saeed al-Mansouri  said in May. If oil prices
are at $75 a barrel, the Arab world’s second-largest economy
will grow between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this year, al-
Mansouri said.  
 A challenge facing the country is “short-term liquidity
management at Islamic banks and other financial institutions,”
al-Suwaidi said today, adding that the U.A.E. Central Bank has
devised “a reasonable proposal to advance a solution for this
issue.”
