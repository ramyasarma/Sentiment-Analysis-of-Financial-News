             (Corrects year Draaisma joined Morgan Stanley in second
paragraph.)  
 Teun Draaisma, Morgan Stanley’s top-
ranked European equity strategist, is leaving the U.S. bank to
join hedge-fund manager TT International, according to a
spokesman for Morgan Stanley.  
 Graham Secker will head the bank’s European equity strategy
team, which also includes Ronan Carr, said Sebastian Howell,
London-based spokesman. Draaisma joined Morgan Stanley in 1997
and was voted best European equity strategist in the 2009
Thomson Extel survey.
