             Mining companies may miss next
month’s deadline to secure financing for the A$4 billion Wiggins
Island coal terminal at Gladstone in Queensland state, the
Australian reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal group will miss the
deadline because of uncertainty caused by the federal
government’s proposed resource super-profits tax and other
issues, the newspaper said. A group spokeswoman, who wasn’t
identified, declined to say when financing commitments are
expected, adding the group is still aiming for a 2013 start date,
the newspaper said.
