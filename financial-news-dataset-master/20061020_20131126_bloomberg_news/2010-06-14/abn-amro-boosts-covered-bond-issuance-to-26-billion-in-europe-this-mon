             ABN Amro NV, Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg and UniCredit SpA’s planned covered bond offerings
will add at least 1.125 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to this
month’s issuance, as sales rebound from the lowest this year.  
 Sales of the bonds, backed by mortgages or state-sector
loans as well as the issuer’s pledge to pay, have risen 83
percent from May to 21.4 billion euros this month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. LBBW, Germany’s biggest state-owned
bank, is selling 1 billion euros of covered bonds yielding 10
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, while Dutch
state-owned lender ABN Amro Bank NV is marketing notes at 83
basis points over swaps. Italian lender  UniCredit SpA  is adding
125 million euros to its 2015 bonds at a spread of 3 basis
points.  
 Borrowers are rushing to sell covered bonds before the
European Central Bank’s 60 billion-euro purchase program aimed
at freeing up lenders’ balance sheets ends this month. Sales of
the debt dropped to 11.1 billion euros in May, the lowest this
year, as the region’s debt crisis roiled investors.  
 “The end of the European Central Bank purchase program in
two weeks and the approaching summer break should be supportive
for ongoing strong covered bond issuance activity,”  Markus Ernst , a credit strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich, wrote in
a note to investors today.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold covered bonds
rather than benchmark government debt rose 2 basis points to 154
basis points last week, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch EMU Covered Bond index.
