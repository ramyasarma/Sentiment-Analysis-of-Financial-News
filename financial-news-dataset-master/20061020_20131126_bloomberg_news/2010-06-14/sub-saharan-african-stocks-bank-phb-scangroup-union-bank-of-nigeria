 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Bank PHB Plc  (PLATINUM NL), a Nigerian lender, snapped five
days of declines, increasing 2 kobo, or 1.7 percent, to 1.19
naira. The bank sees profit of 7.87 billion naira ($52 million)
for the nine months through September, compared with a year
earlier.  
 Oando Plc  (OANDO NL), a Nigerian oil company, retreated 69
kobo, or 0.9 percent, to 79 naira. Oando is in talks to acquire
as many as 4 billion barrels in oil-equivalent resources in
Nigeria with a “ball-park value” of $2 billion, Chief
Executive Officer  Wale Tinubu  said. The company could also spin
off its downstream unit by the end of September.  
 Scangroup Ltd.  (SCAN KN), East Africa’s biggest marketing
and advertising company, surged to the highest on record,
gaining 2 shillings, or 5.9 percent, to 35.75 shillings. The
stock gained on speculation the company may receive regulatory
approval for a joint venture with Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide,
Judd Murigi, head of research at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic
Financial Services Ltd., said in response to e-mailed questions.  
 Union Bank of Nigeria Plc  (UBN NL), a lender bailed out by
the country’s central bank, fell to an almost three-week low,
dropping 26 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5 percent, to
4.97 naira. The lender reported a 97 percent decline in first-
quarter profit from a year earlier.
