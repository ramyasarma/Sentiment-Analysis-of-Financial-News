             Majestic Wine Plc , the biggest
independent U.K. wine chain, said full-year profit more than
tripled as reducing its minimum purchase lured new customers.  
 Net income was 11.3 million pounds ($16.6 million), or 18.3
pence per share, in the year ended March 29, compared with 3.3
million pounds, or 5.3 pence per share in the same period a year
earlier, the Watford, England-based company said today in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service. Sales gained 16
percent to 233.2 million pounds.  
 Majestic said a decision last year to reduce the minimum
purchase to six bottles of wine from 12 helped it add 54,000
customers, giving it a total of 472,000. Majestic also said it’s
seeking to sell more wine over the Internet after sales rose by
almost a fifth to 10 percent of its U.K. total.  
 “For a lot of customers, 12 bottles is something you buy
for a wedding or a party,” Chief Executive Officer  Steve Lewis 
said today in a telephone interview. “Six bottles was much
better for just popping in.”  
 Majestic rose 15.5 pence, or 5.7 percent, to 288 pence at
9:10 a.m. in London, the biggest gain since February 23. The
shares have increased 33 percent so far this year, giving it a
market value of 177 million pounds ($259 million).  
 Lewis said the company will open 12 outlets this year, up
from six, and its goal is to have 250 shops compared with a
current 153.  
 Last year’s earnings included a 5.3 million-pound charge
against the value of its French retail operations. Full-year
sales at stores open at least a year gained 8.4 percent, and 7.3
percent in the 10 weeks ended June 7.
