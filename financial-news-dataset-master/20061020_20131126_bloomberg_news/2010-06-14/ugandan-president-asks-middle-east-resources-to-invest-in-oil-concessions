             Ugandan President  Yoweri Museveni 
wants Middle East Resources, a Dubai-based company, to explore
investment opportunities in the East African country’s oil
industry, the Ugandan presidency said.  
 Museveni, at a meeting with the company’s chief executive,
 Mohammed Alabbar , asked Middle East Resources to submit bids so
that it can compete with other companies in the industry’s
development, the presidency said yesterday in an e-mail from the
capital, Kampala.  
 Uganda has an estimated 2 billion barrels of oil, with 800
million barrels already discovered, according to Tullow Oil Plc,
one of the companies exploring for oil in the country.  
 Museveni also asked the company to consider investing in
Uganda’s agro-processing industry to benefit from tax-free and
quota-free markets for exports to the U.S., Europe, China and
India, the statement said. The country has opportunities in
coffee, tea, beef, fish, milk and cotton processing, it said.
