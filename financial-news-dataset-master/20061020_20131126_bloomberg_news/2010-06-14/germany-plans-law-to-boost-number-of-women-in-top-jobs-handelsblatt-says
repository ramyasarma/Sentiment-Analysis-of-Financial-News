             German Family Minister  Kristina Schroeder  plans legislation to boost the share of women in top
positions at companies, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  
 The law would force companies to set and publish goals for
the share of top jobs they want to give to women, Schroeder told
the newspaper in an interview.  
 Only 3 percent of executives at Germany’s 160 biggest
exchange-listed companies are female, the newspaper said.
Schroeder said she wants to increase the share of women on
executive boards to 20 percent by 2015.
