             Iraq’s new parliament was sworn in
today as a three-month political deadlock over a cabinet line-up
prevented the house from electing its president.  
 A majority of lawmakers elected in the March 7 elections
took the oath in the two official languages, Arabic and Kurdish,
before the eldest lawmaker,  Fuad Massum , closed the session.  
 Iraq’s constitution stipulates that the house elect a
speaker, two deputy speakers and a new president, who asks the
leader of the largest bloc to name a new prime minister.  
 The agenda of Monday’s session did not include a vote on
the matter, Massum said.  
 The parliamentary blocs will take at least “a few days”
before proceeding to the election process, lawmaker  Hassan Suneid  said in an interview on Al-Iraqiya television.  
 Iraqi political groups have been feuding over the
composition of the government since the polls closed without
yielding a clear win. The situation has raised fears about the
stability of the country as the U.S prepares to pull out troops
in August.  
 The deadlock, now in its third month, is similar to the
dispute that delayed announcement of a new government by six
months in 2005, after the first elections held in Iraq following
the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled  Saddam Hussein .
