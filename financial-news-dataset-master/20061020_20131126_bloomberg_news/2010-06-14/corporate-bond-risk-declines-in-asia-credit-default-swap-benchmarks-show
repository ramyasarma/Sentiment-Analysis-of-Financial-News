             The cost of protecting Asian bonds
from non-payment declined, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 6.5 basis points to 139 basis
points as of 1:44 p.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  
 The Markit  iTraxx Japan index  fell 3 basis points to 147 as
of 2:49 p.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices show. Markets in
Australia and China are closed for public holidays.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
