             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found more evidence of oil in an
onshore well in Brazil’s Guriri field, the Brazilian petroleum
regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 3BRSA824DES well in the
Espirito Santo basin, the National Petroleum Agency said on its
Web site. The Guriri field, in the ES-T-383 block, was declared
a commercial find in November 2008.  
 Separately, Cowan Petroleo e Gas SA found evidence of oil
in the 1CW2ES and 1CW3ES onshore wells at the ES-T-400 block,
also in Brazil’s Espirito Santo basin, the regulator said.
