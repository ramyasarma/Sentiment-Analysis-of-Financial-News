             HSBC Holdings Plc  named  Niall Booker 
as chief executive officer of its North American unit, replacing
 Brendan McDonagh  who is retiring after more than 30 years with
the bank.  
 Booker, 51, currently deputy CEO of North America and head
of HSBC Finance, is promoted immediately and joins the group
management board on Aug. 1, the London-based bank said today in
a statement.  
 “The combination of Niall’s four U.S. postings during his
HSBC career to date and his international experience mean that
he is Brendan’s obvious successor,” said HSBC CEO  Michael Geoghegan  in the statement.  
 HSBC’s U.S. unit posted its first profit in three years in
the first quarter, as bad loan provisions declined at HSBC
Finance, formerly known as Household International. The bank has
recorded more than $58 billion in provisions for bad loans in
North America since it bought subprime lender Household for
$15.5 billion in 2003.  
 Booker joined the bank in 1981 and has also served as CEO
of HSBC Middle East and the bank’s operation in India. McDonagh,
also 51, joined the bank in September 1979 and has worked in
Europe, Asia and the Middle East. He has worked in the U.S.
since 2002, the bank said.
