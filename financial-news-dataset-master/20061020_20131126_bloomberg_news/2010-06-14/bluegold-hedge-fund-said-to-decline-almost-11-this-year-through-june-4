             BlueGold Capital Management LLP, the
energy hedge fund manager overseeing $1.8 billion in assets,
fell 10.7 percent in the year through June 4, according to two
investors in the fund.  
 A 2.9 percent drop in the first week of June and a 12.5
percent decrease in May erased gains in the first four months of
the year, the two people said, declining to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Chief Executive Officer
 Dennis Crema  and Chief Investment Officer  Pierre Andurand 
declined to comment.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of 19 commodities slumped
8.2 percent in May on concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis would curb growth and demand for raw materials. New York-
traded crude lost 14 percent last month, the steepest drop since
December 2008. Commodity funds declined 1.7 percent on average
in May, according to New York-based Hedgefund.net.  
 “I’m very confident his fund will bounce back this year,”
 Uday Narang , London-based managing partner of hedge fund
Chichester Capital Management LP, said of Andurand, whom he has
known for a decade. Narang is not an investor in the fund.  
 Crema, 49, and Andurand, 33, founded BlueGold in February
2008 and the fund returned 380 percent between then and the end
of last year.  
 Andurand started his career as an oil trader at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.’s J. Aron & Co. unit in Singapore in 2000.
Crema spent 12 years at oil trader Vitol Group, where he was a
senior partner and head of trading, before founding BlueGold.  
 Hedge funds are private, largely unregulated pools of
capital whose managers can buy or sell any assets and
participate substantially in profits from money invested.
