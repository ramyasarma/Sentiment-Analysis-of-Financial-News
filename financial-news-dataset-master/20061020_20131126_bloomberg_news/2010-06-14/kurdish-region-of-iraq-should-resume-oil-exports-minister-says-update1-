             The Kurdish areas of northern Iraq
should resume oil exports “immediately,” without waiting for
clearance from the finance ministry, Iraqi Oil Minister  Hussain Al-Shahristani  said.  
 Kurdistan should not wait for an agreement on payments to
foreign companies before resuming oil exports, he said in an
interview in Baghdad today.  
 “We have informed them that they should resume oil exports
immediately, and we are surprised at their reluctance to do
so,” he said.  
 “This issue is not related to the ministry of finance,”
he said.  
 The semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan has previously said
that it was expecting a letter from the Iraqi finance ministry
on the mechanism for payments involving foreign companies
working in the province.  
 Iraq’s central government approved last month an agreement
between the oil ministry and Kurdistan to resume oil exports
produced in the province.  
 Companies including DNO International ASA and Genel Enerji
AS halted oil exports from Kurdistan in October, about four
months after they started, because there was no procedure in
place to pay them.  
 DNO International rose as much as 1.9 percent in Oslo,
after Shahristani’s comments. The shares were up 4.2 percent
today at 8.185 kroner at 10:10 a.m. GMT.
