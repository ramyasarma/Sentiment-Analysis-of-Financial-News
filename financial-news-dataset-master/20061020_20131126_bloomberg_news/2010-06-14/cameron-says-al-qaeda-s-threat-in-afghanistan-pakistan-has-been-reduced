             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
speaking after a trip to Afghanistan last week, said the threat
from the al-Qaeda terror network in that country and neighboring
Pakistan had diminished.  
 “Today I am advised that the threat from al-Qaeda from
Afghanistan and Pakistan has reduced,” Cameron told lawmakers
in Parliament in London today. “But I am also advised that if
it were not for the current presence of U.K. and international
coalition forces, al-Qaeda would return to Afghanistan and the
threat to the U.K. would rise.”  
 Former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown , who lost power in
elections last month, repeatedly said that three quarters of all
terrorist plots investigated in the U.K are linked to Muslim
extremists based in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area.  
 Cameron’s spokesman  Steve Field  could not immediately
provide more details of the premier’s assessment of the terror
threat when questioned by reporters in London today.
