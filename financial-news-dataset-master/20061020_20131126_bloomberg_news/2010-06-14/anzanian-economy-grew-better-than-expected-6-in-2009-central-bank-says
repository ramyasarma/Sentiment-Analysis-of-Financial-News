             Tanzania’s economy grew a better-
than expected 6 percent last year, the country’s central bank
said in its June monetary policy statement. It had earlier
projected 5 percent growth.  
 Inflation is expected to slow further on food supply and
the country collected 91.3 percent of its revenue target in the
first nine months of its financial year, the bank said on its
website today.
