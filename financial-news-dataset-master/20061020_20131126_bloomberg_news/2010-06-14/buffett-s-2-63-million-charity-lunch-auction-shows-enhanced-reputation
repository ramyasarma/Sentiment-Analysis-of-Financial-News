             Warren Buffett ’s annual charity-
lunch auction reached a record $2.63 million after a year in
which the billionaire defied an economic slump by completing his
biggest takeover and boosting Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s profit.  
 Bidding outpaced last year’s during the first days of the
weeklong event and ended in a frenzy June 11 with 77 offers,
according to EBay Inc., which ran the online sale. Proceeds go
to the San Francisco-based  Glide Foundation , a favorite charity
of Buffett’s first wife,  Susan , who died in 2004. The winner
asked to remain anonymous, the organization said.  
 As a global credit crisis accelerated in 2008, firms
seeking capital appealed to Buffett, 79, for support, and  Barack Obama  enlisted his economic expertise during the presidential-
election campaign. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire prospered
without a U.S. bailout, providing Buffett with funds for a $27
billion  buyout  of railroad  Burlington Northern Santa Fe  in
February.  
 “Warren Buffett’s reputation, if anything, has been
enhanced over the last couple of years” as Berkshire was
sustained by the $44 billion cash cushion that he built through
the end of 2007, said  David Kass , a professor at the University
of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “For those
who can afford it, this lunch can have great value.”  
 New York Steakhouse  
 Buffett, the world’s third-richest person, rose to
prominence through five decades of investing success. Like in
previous years, he will meet the winner and as many as seven
guests for lunch at  Smith & Wollensky , the steakhouse on New
York’s Third Avenue with the commercial tagline “Nice to see
you again.”  
 Berkshire’s investments in firms that were blamed for
contributing to the housing slump have increased pressure on
Buffett to publicly discuss the financial crisis, assign blame
and recommend remedies.  
 At his company’s annual meeting in May, shareholders
pressed Buffett about his investment in  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. , which was sued by regulators in April for misleading
investors. Buffett on June 2 defended credit-ratings firm
 Moody’s Corp. , another Berkshire holding, at a hearing by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.  
 Moody’s management shouldn’t be singled out for failing to
anticipate the nationwide decline in housing prices, Buffett
said.  John Taylor , chief executive officer of the National
Community Reinvestment Coalition, said after Buffett’s testimony
that ratings firms deserve blame for assigning top grades to
securities created by Wall Street that plunged in value.  
 ‘Stinking Garbage’  
 Investment banks “walked into the room with a bagful of
stinking garbage and the rating agencies not only embraced it
but put their best sale of approval on it,” Taylor said.  
 Diners at the charity lunch may leave the table with
investment ideas, business contacts and career advice, said
Kass, who accompanied 48 students to Omaha for a lunch with
Buffett five years ago. After that meal, Buffett picked up the
tab, Kass said.  
 The auction’s previous record was set in 2008, when hedge
fund manager  Zhao Danyang  of Hong Kong won it for $2.11 million.
A group led by  Courtenay Wolfe  of Salida Capital paid $1.68
million last year. Greenlight Capital Inc.’s  David Einhorn 
prevailed in 2003 with a $250,100 bid. Including this year,
Buffett has raised more than $8 million with the auctions to
help Glide, which serves meals to the needy.  
 “It’s actually a remarkable calibration of his value,”
said  Jeff Matthews , author of “Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett’s
Omaha” and founder of hedge fund Ram Partners LP. “It measures
what people think his worth to them is.”  
 Profits Amid Crisis  
 Berkshire’s earnings increased  61 percent  to $8.06 billion
in 2009, helped by Buffett’s investments during the crisis. The
company got a coupon of 12 percent on an investment of 3 billion
Swiss francs ($2.6 billion) in Swiss Reinsurance Co. and of 10
percent on a $3 billion allocation to  General Electric Co .  
 The $5 billion that Buffett injected in Goldman Sachs 2008
yields $500 million a year for Berkshire, and the warrants he
negotiated as part of the deal show a paper profit of more than
$897 million. Weeks before he invested in the New York-based
bank, he rebuffed a request for funds from American
International Group Inc., which then needed a U.S. rescue.  
 Buffett’s fortune was estimated at $47 billion by Forbes
magazine in March, placing him behind telecommunications
investor  Carlos Slim  and  Microsoft Corp.  co-founder  Bill Gates 
in the worldwide rankings. Buffett’s stock picks and takeovers
turned Berkshire from a failing textile mill to a $184 billion
seller of bricks, power and hurricane insurance.  
 Annual Meeting  
 His views on markets are followed by investors around the
world, and tens of thousands of people gather in Omaha each year
at Berkshire’s annual meeting to hear Buffett expound on the
economy and public policy. He advised Obama during his
successful 2008 campaign, and the president seized upon
Buffett’s characterization of derivatives as  “weapons of mass
destruction”  to rally support for reform.  
 In 2006, Buffett pledged 85 percent of his Berkshire
holdings, a commitment valued at about $37 billion at the time,
to the  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  and charities of four of
his family members. The Gates donation is being made in annual
installments, and will continue after Buffett’s death. The
charity, established by Gates and his wife, combats disease and
global poverty, and funds U.S. education initiatives.
