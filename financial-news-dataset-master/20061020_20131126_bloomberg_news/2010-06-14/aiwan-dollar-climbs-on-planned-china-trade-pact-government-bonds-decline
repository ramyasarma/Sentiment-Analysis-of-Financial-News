             Taiwan’s dollar rose to its highest
level in more than a week on optimism the island will sign a
trade pact with China this month, helping spur exports to the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  
 China and Taiwan held talks over the weekend to strengthen
economic and trade ties, reaching a basic agreement on
industries chosen for initial tariff cuts. Overseas funds bought
$179 million more of Taiwanese equities than they sold on June
11, a second day of net purchases, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Bonds declined as investors sought higher returns in
the stock market.  
 “It seems the trade deal is progressing as planned,” said
 Lucas Lee , an economist at Mega Securities Co. in Taipei. “At
this stage, it is helping attract overseas funds.”  
 The local dollar rose 0.4 percent to NT$32.316 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 10:07 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier reached NT$32.228, the strongest
level since June 4.  
 Cross-strait ties improved after President Ma Ying-jeou
took office in May 2008 and abandoned his predecessor’s pro-
independence stance. Ma’s administration has said the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement, or ECFA, may be signed this
month. China is Taiwan’s biggest overseas market and No. 1
investment destination.  
 Taiwan’s 10-year government bonds fell on speculation
investors shifted funds to equities. The Taiex index of stocks
climbed for a third day, buoyed by the prospect of closer
economic ties with China.  
 “The development in ECFA is negative for bonds,” said Lee.  
 The yield on the 1.375 percent bond maturing March 2020
climbed one basis point to 1.48 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market, Taiwan’s biggest exchange for bonds. Its
price fell 0.0757, or NT$75.7 per NT$100,000 face amount, to
99.0531. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
