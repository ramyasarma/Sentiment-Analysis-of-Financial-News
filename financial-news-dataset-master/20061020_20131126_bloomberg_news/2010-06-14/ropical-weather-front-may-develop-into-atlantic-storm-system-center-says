             A low-pressure weather disturbance
about 1,025 miles (1,649 kilometers) west-southwest of the Cape
Verde Islands in the Atlantic Ocean has the potential to develop
into a tropical cyclone within a couple of days, the National
Hurricane Center in Miami said.  
 “There remains a high chance -- 60 percent -- of this
system becoming a tropical cyclone during the next 48 hours,”
the center said in an outlook  statement  on its website at 2
a.m. New York time today.  
 The disturbance, on the high sea between Venezuela and West
Africa, is moving northwest at 15 miles per hour, the report
said.
