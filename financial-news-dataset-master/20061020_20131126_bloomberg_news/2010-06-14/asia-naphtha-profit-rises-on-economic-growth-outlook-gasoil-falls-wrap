             The profit from processing crude oil
into naphtha, used to make plastic bottles and polyester
clothing, rose in Asia on signs an economic recovery will boost
demand for petrochemicals.  
 Naphtha swaps  discount  to benchmark Dubai crude today
narrowed $1.48 to $2.57 a barrel, according to data from broker
PVM Oil Associates Ltd. Japan open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half July delivery were bid at $670.50 a
ton against offers at $673.50 at 9:34 a.m. Singapore time,
according to broker Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. That’s about

points last quarter, the government said in a report in Tokyo
today. Overall naphtha deliveries in the Asia-Pacific climbed
0.8 percent in April over March, with China posting a 42 percent
