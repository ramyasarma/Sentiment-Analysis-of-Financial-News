             Amazon.com Inc. , the world’s largest
online merchant, won the top spot in an annual survey of the
healthiest U.S. and Canadian retailers for a second year in a
row as more shoppers make purchases online.  
 Amazon.com’s technology keeps inventory levels and expenses
down, said Consensus Advisors Chief Executive Officer  Michael O’Hara , whose firm did the survey. Aeropostale Inc., Urban
Outfitters Inc., CVS Caremark Corp. and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
round out the top five in the list, released today.  
 Amazon.com  has posted three consecutive  quarters  of profit
growth as consumers begin spending again amid the economic
recovery. E-commerce retailers have an “inherent advantage”
because they don’t have to buy and own inventory in hundreds of
stores, O’Hara said in an interview last week.  
 “Our highest rated company, Amazon.com, has exploited the
increasing availability of broadband Internet and mobile
technology to build a fast-growing and highly efficient
retailing superpower,” O’Hara said.  
 Consensus Advisors examined about 160 publicly held
retailers over a five-year period on criteria such as growth,
debt levels and ability to control pricing. The Boston-based
firm began the survey last year, and the results were compiled
before  CVS Caremark  became embroiled in a dispute over its drug
plans with Walgreen Co.  
 Several of the retailers in the top 10, like  Coach Inc.  and
Guess? Inc., make and sell their own brands, allowing them to
retain higher profits on sales.  
 Others, such as Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart,
benefited as consumers restricted spending to basics in the
steepest economic slump since the Great Depression.  
 New Arrivals  
 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and clothing retailer Buckle Inc.
completed the top 10, along with new addition  Lululemon
Athletica Inc. , a Vancouver-based yoga apparel company. While
Lululemon has potential to expand as a newer chain, its narrow
focus may limit sales growth, O’Hara said.  
 “Any specialty-store concept that is focused on one niche
concept is always at risk of that niche being out of favor,” he
said. “There’s a lot of places to do what Lululemon has done --
nonetheless,  Lululemon  is doing it the best right now.”
