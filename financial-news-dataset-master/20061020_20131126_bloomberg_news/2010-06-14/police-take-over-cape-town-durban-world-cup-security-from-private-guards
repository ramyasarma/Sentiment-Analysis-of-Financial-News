             South African police took control of
security at the soccer World Cup stadiums in Cape Town and
Durban today after private guards went on strike over pay.  
 “This is an employer-employee wage dispute,”  Danny Jordaan , head of the tournament’s local organizing committee
said in a statement distributed in Cape Town today. “Although
we have respect for worker rights, we find it unacceptable for
them to disrupt match-day proceedings.”  
 The security guards are employed by Johannesburg-based
Stallion Security Consortium (Pty) Ltd.  
 There were adequate police personnel to control access to
the Cape Town stadium, where Italy is playing Paraguay in a
Group F encounter tonight, and the process ran smoothly,
spokesman Billy Jones said in a telephone interview from the
site.  
 Driving rain prompted many fans to forgo public transport
and use their own cars to travel to the Cape Town stadium today,
tying up traffic.  
 An hour before the game, the situation had improved and
traffic was flowing again, city spokeswoman Kylie Hatton said in
a telephone interview.  
 Yesterday, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
break up a protest over pay following a match between Germany
and Australia in Durban, on South Africa’s east coast.
