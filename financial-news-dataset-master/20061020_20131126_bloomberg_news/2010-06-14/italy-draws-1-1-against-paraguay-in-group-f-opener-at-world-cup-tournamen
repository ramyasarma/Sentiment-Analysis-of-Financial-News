             Defending champion Italy rallied in
the second half to tie 1-1 against Paraguay in the opening match
of Group F at soccer’s World Cup.  
 Antolin Alcaraz gave Paraguay a 39th-minute lead in driving
rain in Cape Town, South Africa, with  Daniele De Rossi  tying the
game on 63 minutes.  
 Italy, which has progressed from the group stage at the
past eight World Cups, is aiming to match Brazil’s record five
titles. Paraguay has three times reached the round of 16.  
 New Zealand and Slovakia are also in Group F and play their
first game tomorrow. Earlier today in Group E, the Netherlands
won 2-0 against Denmark, while Japan beat Cameroon 1-0.  
 Alcaraz outjumped  Fabio Cannavaro  and De Rossi to head a
cross from Aureliano Torres past  Gianluigi Buffon  as Paraguay
looked for a first win against Italy.  
 The Italians had to replace Buffon with Federico Marchetti
at halftime, but Paraguay struggled to test his replacement as
Italy started to take control.  
 De Rossi got his team’s goal after the Paraguay keeper
Justo Villar failed to clear a corner.
