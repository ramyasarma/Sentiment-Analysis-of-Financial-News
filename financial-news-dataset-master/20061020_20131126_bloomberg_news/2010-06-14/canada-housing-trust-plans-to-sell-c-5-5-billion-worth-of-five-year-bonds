             Canada Housing Trust, the financing
arm of the nation’s housing agency, plans to sell at least C$5.5
billion ($5.4 billion) of fixed-rate bonds maturing on June 1
2015, according to  David DesLauriers , managing director of
government finance in Toronto at Toronto Dominion Bank, lead
coordinator of the sale.  
 The notes may be priced to yield 43 basis points over the
2.5 percent Canadian government bond maturing in June 2015,
DesLauriers said in an e-mailed statement. Pricing is expected
to complete by noon tomorrow.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, National Bank Financial and
Royal Bank of Canada are also part of the syndicate handling the
sale.
