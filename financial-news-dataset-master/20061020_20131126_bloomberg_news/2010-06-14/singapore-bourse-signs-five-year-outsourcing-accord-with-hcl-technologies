             Singapore Exchange Ltd. , operator of
the city’s derivatives and securities exchange, signed a five-
year, S$110 million ($79 million) information-technology
infrastructure outsourcing agreement with India’s HCL
Technologies Ltd.  
 The contract is part of a S$250 million ($179 million)
project to speed up the bourse’s trading systems,  Bob Caisley ,
Singapore Exchange’s chief information officer, told reporters.  
 The bourse said on June 3 that investment will allow its
systems to execute transactions in 90 microseconds, the fastest
in the world. High-frequency trading already accounts for about
30 percent of derivatives transactions on Singapore’s exchange,
according to the bourse.  
 Exchanges worldwide have been building networks in response
to competition from alternative trading systems such as dark
pools and other off-exchange platforms.
