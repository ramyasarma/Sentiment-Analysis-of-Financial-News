             Akbank TAS , a Turkish bank part-
owned by Citigroup Inc., is considering opening an office in
Russia and will expand in the Gulf with corporate and investment
banking, chairwoman  Suzan Sabanci  said.  
 Akbank will use its representative office in Dubai as a
platform to grow in the Middle East region and may consider
retail banking later “if we think the market is there,”
Sabanci said in an interview two days ago on the sidelines of a
Chatham House roundtable meeting in Istanbul hosted by Akbank.  
 The Turkish government should do more to encourage foreign
direct investment, “entrepreneurship” and small and medium-
sized businesses, Sabanci said. Turkey’s fiscal and monetary
policy is “very strong,” she said.  
 Akbank plans to grow in Turkey organically and will only
consider acquisitions should “it create long-term shareholder
value,” Sabanci said.  
 Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS , Turkey’s second-biggest group
of companies, owns a controlling stake in Akbank. Citigroup has
20 percent.
