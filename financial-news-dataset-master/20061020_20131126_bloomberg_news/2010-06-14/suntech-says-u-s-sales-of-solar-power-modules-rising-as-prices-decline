             Suntech Power Holdings Co. , the
world’s largest maker of polysilicon solar-power modules, said
U.S. sales are increasing as lower prices make panels more
attractive to utilities and residential customers.  
 Suntech expects U.S. sales of 200 megawatts to 250
megawatts this year, compared with 65 megawatts last year, Chief
Strategy Officer  Steven Chan  said today in an interview in
Hollywood, Florida.  
 The U.S., which accounts for about 10 percent of the Wuxi,
China-based company’s sales, will be its biggest market in four
or five years, Chan said.  
 Lower production costs allowed Suntech to cut prices in the
U.S. about 10 percent to $1.70 to $2 per watt this year, he
said.  
 Globally, Suntech plans to sell 1,400 megawatts this year,
compared with 704 megawatts in 2009, Chan said. The company’s
previous forecast for 2010 was 1,300 megawatts.  
 Electricite de France SA is Suntech’s largest customer in
the U.S., Chan said.
