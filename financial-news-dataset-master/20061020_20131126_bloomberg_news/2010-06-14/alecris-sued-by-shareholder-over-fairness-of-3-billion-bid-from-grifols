             Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings
Corp.  was sued by an investment fund challenging the fairness of
a $3 billion cash-and-stock buyout offer from  Grifols SA ,
Europe’s largest maker of blood-plasma products.  
 Directors of Talecris, based in Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina, have a duty to get the best price for
shareholders, the Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds contend in a
Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed today in Wilmington.  
 “Talecris is a leading biotherapeutic company with
excellent prospects for financial growth,” and company insiders
“are well aware of the company’s intrinsic value and the fact
that Talecris shares are significantly undervalued,” the funds
lawyers said in the complaint.  
 Barcelona, Spain-based Grifols said June 7 it would pay $19
in cash and 0.641 of its shares for each Talecris share. The
deal is valued at about $3.4 billion, according to court papers.
The lawsuit asks a judge to stop the transaction and award
damages and legal fees.  
 Drayton Virkler , spokesman for Talecris, wasn’t immediately
available to comment on the lawsuit.  
 Talecris rose 7 cents to $21.88 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Grifols rose 2 cents to 8.80 euros
in trading in Spain today.
