             The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in U.K. and Irish
markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses and prices are from
the last market close.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  rose 38.45, or 0.7 percent, to
5,202.13. The  FTSE All-Share Index  climbed 0.8 percent and
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced 0.3 percent.  
 Bellway Plc  (BWY LN): The homebuilder said its sales rate
for the 18 weeks through June 15 was “broadly comparable” with
last year’s performance. The shares declined 0.9 percent to 635
pence.  
 BP Plc  (BP/ LN): The oil company has hired three advisors
including Blackstone Group LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to
stop a potential hostile takeover, Fox Business Network
reported, citing people familiar with the situation that it
didn’t identify. The stock fell 9.3 percent to 355.45 pence.  
 British Sky Broadcasting Plc  (BSY LN): News Corp. says it
approached the board of BSkyB with an offer for the pay-TV
company at 700 pence per share in cash. The independent
directors of BSkyB said the proposal “significantly” undervalues
the company. The stock advanced 2.4 percent to 600.5 pence.  
 Hargreaves Services Plc  (HSP LN): The company said it
expects overall full-year results to be in line with management
forecasts. The stock increased 1 percent to 635 pence.  
 Healthcare Locums Plc  (HLO LN): The company said that all
discussions about a possible takeover offer have ceased. The
stock sank 4 percent to 217.5 pence.  
 Photo-Me International Plc  (PHTM LN): The company said its
pretax profit excluding one-time items will exceed current
market estimates of about 10.5 million pounds ($15 million) for
the year ended April 30 by about 20 percent. The stock was
unchanged at 30 pence.  
 Spice Plc  (SPI LN): Cinven Ltd. confirmed it is considering
an offer for Spice and said it made an approach on May 24. Spice
rejected the bid of 56 pence a share. Talks are not taking place
between the companies, Cinven said. Spice shares jumped 7
percent to 49.75 pence.  
 Ted Baker Plc  (TBK LN): The clothing company that dressed
James Bond actor  Daniel Craig  in “Casino Royale” said sales
rose 18 percent in the 19 weeks ended June 12 compared with the
same period a year earlier. Gross margin was “in line with
expectations,” the company said. The shares rose 0.2 percent to
506 pence.  
 Tesco Plc  (TSCO LN): The U.K.’s largest supermarket chain
said domestic revenue barely grew in the first quarter as
inflation eased and shoppers balked at the prospect of higher
taxes. Sales at U.K. stores open at least a year rose 0.1
percent, excluding gasoline and value-added tax, in the 13 weeks
ended May 30, the retailer said. That was less than the 2.7
percent growth the company reported for the second half of the
previous year and missed the 0.4 percent median estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The stock fell 0.7 percent
to 391.65 pence.
