             German government bonds fell as
rising stock markets and higher-than-forecast industrial output
in the euro region mitigated demand for the safest assets.  
 German  10-year yields  rose from within six basis points of
their lowest in more than 20 years, reached last week as concern
about Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis deepened.  Industrial
production  in the euro area grew 0.8 percent in April from
March, European Union statistics showed, above economists’ 0.5
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The  Stoxx Europe
600 Index  added 1 percent, its fourth straight increase. Belgian
bonds fell relative to bunds as election results suggested the
country faces political deadlock.  
 “Some normality has resumed insofar as higher stocks mean
lower bonds,” said  Marius Daheim , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Bayerische Landesbank in Munich. “It will take
some time before markets have some confidence that the crisis is
over, helping bund yields to creep upwards.”  
 The German 10-year bund yield rose six basis points to 2.63
percent as of 3:24 p.m. in London. The 3 percent security due
July 2020 fell 0.58, or 5.8 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,219) face
amount, to 103.21. Two-year yields climbed three basis points to
0.50 percent.  
 Bund yields touched the lowest since at least 1989 on June
8 amid speculation that weaker euro-region economies will be
overwhelmed by their debts, stoking demand for the perceived
safety of German fixed-income assets. The crisis has driven the
16-nation currency down 20 percent between Nov. 25, 2009 and the
end of last week.  
 Bond Buying  
 Soaring bond yields in so-called peripheral euro-region
nations, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal, forced the EU
to craft a 750 billion-euro ($913 billion) rescue package and
the European Central Bank to start buying government bonds on
May 10.  
 The premium that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds over benchmark German bunds increased 14 basis points to
204 basis points. Europa Press reported that Spanish unions will
call a general strike to protest the government’s planned
changes to labor laws.  
 Spain needs to shore up its savings banks on its own and
doesn’t require European Union aid to tackle its public debt,
the German Finance Ministry said today. Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s government “currently sees no need for action” to
help Spain from the EU’s aid package, Finance Ministry spokesman
Michael Offer told reporters in Berlin today.  
 The yield on Greek 10-year government bonds rose eight
basis points relative to German bunds for a difference of 539
basis points. The so-called yield spread between  German and
Irish 10-year bonds  widened two basis points to 256 basis
points, while the Portuguese-German spread widened six basis
points to 259 basis points.  
 Belgian Election  
 The  German-Belgian spread  widened by four basis points to
83 basis points after Flemish nationalists who want more
autonomy for their region took the lead in Belgium’s general
elections.  
 The euro climbed 1.3 percent against the dollar to $1.2268,
its fourth gain in five days, after falling to a four-year low
of $1.1877 on June 7.  
 Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann ,
reversing earlier remarks, said he’s confident Greece can repay
its debt because the nation is committed to reform.  
 “The personal commitment given by the prime minister to
implement the necessary reforms, however difficult they are,
even sacrificing his own political future, convinces me it will
happen,” Ackermann told reporters in Vienna on June 11 after a
speech by Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou . “It will
enable them to service their debt.”  
 Ignoring Positives  
 Europe’s debt crisis has created an environment in which
investors dwell on negative developments even when data show
economic recovery, the Bank for International Settlements said.  
 “Against this background of heightened uncertainty, market
participants focused on the deteriorating financial-market
conditions while often ignoring positive macroeconomic news,”
the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said in its quarterly report
yesterday. “The April jobs report, for example, saw U.S. non-
farm payrolls increase by 100,000 more jobs than expected to
290,000, but the S&P 500 Index fell by 1.5 percent on the day.”  
 German  factory orders  unexpectedly jumped for a second
month in April as the weaker euro boosted export demand and
companies increased investment. Orders, adjusted for seasonal
swings and inflation, rose 2.8 percent from March, when they
surged 5.1 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said on June
7. Economists had forecast a 0.4 percent drop.  
 ‘Fundamental Focus’  
 “At some point, the focus will turn once again to the
fundamentals, and some of the past few months’ moves towards
safety could be partly reversed,”  Laurent Fransolet , head of
European fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital in London,
wrote in a research report today.  
 Euro-region governments plan to sell more than 16 billion
euros of bonds this week, starting with Ireland’s sale of up to
1.5 billion euros of 2016 and 2018 notes tomorrow. Germany plans
to auction 5 billion euros of 10-year bonds on June 16, while
Spain will sell an undisclosed amount of 2020 and 2041 bonds on
June 17. France is scheduled to auction 8 billion euros of 2012,
2013 and 2015 notes and 1.8 billion euros of inflation-linked
securities maturing in 2017, 2023 and 2040 on June 17.  
 German government bonds returned 7 percent this year,
compared with 4.5 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 5.3 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
