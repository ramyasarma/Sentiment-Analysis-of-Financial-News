             Marsh & McLennan Cos., the second-
largest insurance broker, climbed the most since September after
resolving a lawsuit brought by the Alaska Retirement Management
Board that blamed the firm for billions of dollars in unfunded
liabilities.  
 Marsh & McLennan gained 77 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $22.85
at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
New York-based broker’s Mercer consulting unit said late June 11
that it was in the company’s best interest to pay $500 million
to settle because of the uncertainty of the outcome of a jury
trial.
