             Coffee futures rose to a 23-month
high in New York on speculation that global supplies may lag
behind demand. Cocoa also gained.  
 Coffee exports from Uganda, Africa’s biggest exporter, may
fall 17 percent this month, the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said on June 11. European stockpiles fell 4.7 percent
to 10.7 million bags on April 30 from a month earlier, the
European Coffee Federation said last week. Prices climbed 14
percent in the past five sessions.  
 “The supply situation is tight,” said  Rodrigo Costa , a
vice president of institutional sales at Newedge USA LLC in New
York.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 5.5 cents, or
3.8 percent, to $1.516 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching $1.523, the highest price for a most-active
contract since July 3, 2008.  
 In another ICE market, cocoa for September delivery climbed
$36, or 1.2 percent, to $2,973 a metric ton. The chocolate
ingredient declined 9.6 percent this year.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for July delivery
rose 27 pounds, or 1.1 percent, to 2,485 pounds ($3,664) a ton.
Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery gained $34, or 2.2
percent, to $1,558 a ton, sixth-straight gain.
