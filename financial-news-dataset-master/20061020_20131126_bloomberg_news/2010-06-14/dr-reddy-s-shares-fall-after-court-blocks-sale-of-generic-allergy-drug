             Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. ,
India’s second-largest drugmaker, fell the most in more than
four months in Mumbai after a court in the U.S. blocked sales of
its version of allergy medication Allegra.  
 Dr. Reddy’s  lost 3.7 percent to close at 1,411.55 rupees in
Mumbai, the biggest decline since Jan. 21. India’s benchmark
Sensitive index gained 1.6 percent.  
 The U.S. District Court of New Jersey granted a preliminary
injunction brought by  Sanofi-Aventis SA  and Albany Molecular
Research Inc. against Dr. Reddy’s’ application to market generic
Allegra D24, a longer acting version of the drug, according to a
statement from the Hyderabad-based company.  
 “Dr. Reddy’s strongly disagrees with the court’s decision
and intends to appeal,” the Indian company said in the June 12
statement.  
 Allegra was Paris-based Sanofi’s  fifth-largest drug  last
year, accounting for 731 million euros ($894 million) or 2.5
percent of revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. is India’s biggest drugmaker by sales.
