             Crude oil fell in New York as
concern over possible European sovereign debt defaults
outweighed speculation of rising fuel demand after industrial
production in the region climbed.  
 Oil retraced yesterday’s 1.8 percent climb after Moody’s
Investors Service cut Greece’s government bond ratings to junk.
Prices had advanced after a report that economic output in the
eurozone had its biggest year-on-year rise since data was first
collected in 1991. The euro pared gains against the dollar,
limiting the appeal of commodities to investors.  
 “Any downgrades now are expected so the reaction will be
muted,” said  Mark Waggoner , president of Excel Futures Inc. in
Newport Beach, California. “It brought the stock market down so
you’re seeing a bit of follow through on that.”  
 Crude oil for July delivery fell as much as 38 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $74.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was at $74.81 a barrel at 7:48 a.m. Singapore time.
The contract yesterday rose $1.34 to settle at $75.12. Prices
are down 5.7 percent this year.  
 Oil retreated after Moody’s Investors Service said it
downgraded Greece’s government bond ratings by four levels to
Ba1 from A3. Oil and the euro tumbled in May on concern that
Greece’s debt crisis would spread to other nations using the
common currency.  
 Equities also gave back earlier gains with the  S&P  500
losing 0.2 percent to 1,089.63 in New York. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average decreased 20.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to
10,190.89.  
 European Production  
 The euro yesterday gained as much as 1.5 percent against
the dollar on the industrial production report. After the Greek
downgrade the currency rose 0.9 percent at $1.2221. It was
trading at $1.2210 at 7:31 a.m. Singapore time.  
 European industrial output advanced 0.8 percent in April
from March, according to the EU’s statistics office in
Luxembourg. Economists projected a gain of 0.5 percent,
according to the median of 33 responses in a Bloomberg News
survey. Production increased 9.5 percent from a year earlier.  
 Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities probably
increased in May for the 10th time in 11 months, according to
the median estimate from 63 economists polled by Bloomberg News
before Federal Reserve figures scheduled for June 16.  
 “If we meet or exceed expectations things should be
fine,” said Excel’s Waggoner. “Obviously if it’s below, that
will hurt the stock market a bit and subsequently hurt oil. It’s
still following the stock market, absolutely.”  
 Stockpiles Fall  
 Brent crude oil for July settlement increased 85 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $75.20 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday.  
 U.S. inventories of crude oil probably slipped for a third
week as imports declined, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Stockpiles  fell 1.75 million barrels in the seven days
ended June 11 from 361.4 million the week before, according to
the median of eight analyst estimates before an Energy
Department report this week.  
 Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 1 million barrels from 155
million, according to the survey. Gasoline  stockpiles  rose
625,000 barrels from 219 million, the survey said.
