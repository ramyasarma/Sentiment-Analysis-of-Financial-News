             Teun Draaisma , Morgan Stanley’s top-
ranked European equity strategist, is leaving after 13 years at
the  U.S. bank  to start a hedge fund for investment company TT
International.  
 Following Draaisma’s departure,  Graham Secker  will head the
bank’s European equity strategy team, which also includes  Ronan Carr , said  Sebastian Howell , a London-based spokesman for Morgan
Stanley. Draaisma joined Morgan Stanley in 1997 and was voted
best European equity strategist in the 2009 Thomson Extel
survey.  
 In December, Draaisma was the only strategist among 16
surveyed by Bloomberg to forecast a retreat in European stocks
by the end of 2010. He raised his recommendation on the region’s
equities to “overweight” from “underweight” on May 10 to
“take advantage of the recent weakness.” The benchmark  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  slumped 15 percent from this year’s high on
April 15 to May 25 amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis may
derail the economic recovery.  
 Draaisma was joint head of European strategy with  Ben Funnell  from 2003 until 2006, when Funnell moved to hedge fund
 GLG Partners Inc.  A call to TT International was referred to the
marketing department, where no one was immediately available to
comment.
