             Rangers’ owner said it’s dropping a
plan to sell control of the Scottish soccer champion.  
 Murray International Holdings Ltd. said in October it was
considering options including the possible sale of a controlling
stake in the Glasgow-based team.  
 Today, in a Regulatory News Service statement, MIH said it
had received interest in the stake from “a number of
parties” but it had not been able to secure an offer that it
considered to be “in the best interests of the club, its
shareholders and its fans.”  
 MIH, whose chairman is David Murray, said it had “recent
positive discussions” with Lloyds Banking Group Plc that give
it a “real platform for operational stability.”  
 Murray International said it considers that the interests
of stakeholders are “presently best served” by providing the
soccer management team and board of directors with an
opportunity to implement its business plan, which it said is
supported by Lloyds.  
 “In these circumstances, MIH hereby announces that it is
no longer actively marketing its controlling stake in the club
for sale,” MIH said.  
 On June 9, RFC Holdings (Guernsey) Ltd., a company
controlled by London-based property developer Andrew Ellis, said
it was in “advanced” talks with Murray about buying a
controlling stake.  
 In May, Rangers won the Scottish league for a record-
extending 53rd time.  
 The club had net income of 13.1 million pounds ($19.4
million) in the six months ended Dec. 31 after a loss of 3.9
million pounds in the year-earlier period. Revenue almost
doubled to 37.8 million pounds.
