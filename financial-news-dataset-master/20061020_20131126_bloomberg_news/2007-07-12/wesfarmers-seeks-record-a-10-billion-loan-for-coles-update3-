             Wesfarmers Ltd. (WESDA)  is seeking A$10
billion ($8.6 billion) of loans to fund its takeover of Coles
Group Ltd., the largest borrowing by an Australia-based company.  
 Wesfarmers, the nation's biggest home-improvement chain,
hired  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) 
and  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  to arrange the loan, according
to a statement today from the banks. The bid values Coles at
A$19.1 billion based on today's share price.  
 Chief Executive Officer Richard Goyder is seeking to finance
Australia's largest takeover at a lower cost by tapping demand
for investment-grade debt. Wesfarmers's private equity partners
dropped out of their bidding for Coles as concern over U.S.
subprime mortgage defaults made it more expensive to finance
leveraged buyouts.  
 Credit-default swaps based on $10 million of Wesfarmers debt
were unchanged at $40,000 at 5:50 p.m. in Sydney, according to
BNP Paribas.  
 ``Wesfarmers' credit-default swaps are tighter than they
should be if it is taking $8 billion of debt,'' said David Verschoor, a credit derivatives trader with BNP in  Hong Kong .
``As this funding comes through, I expect people to start
repricing Wesfarmers' debt.''  
 Credit Ratings  
 The loans will be for a combination of short and medium
terms which will also allow Wesfarmers to refinance them through
other debt-market products, according to the statement, which
didn't provide details on maturities and pricings. The three
arrangers plan to sell the loans to Australian and international
banks, the statement said.  
 Buyout firms typically raise two-thirds of the acquisition
price by borrowing and then use the target company's cash flow to
repay lenders, causing a deterioration in credit ratings.  
 Wesfarmers's debt is rated A-, the seventh-highest of 10
investment grades, by  Standard & Poor's .  
 ``People are unsure about the rating outcome for Wesfarmers,
the market is assuming it would get downgraded to BBB+ or BBB,''
Verschoor said.  
 Perth-based Wesfarmers will also sell as much as A$14
billion in new stock to secure control of 3,000 supermarkets,
 discount stores  and office supply outlets.  
 The offer from Wesfarmers, whose businesses also include
mining and insurance, was worth A$15.91 a share based on today's
closing prices. Investors will receive A$4 cash, 0.2843
Wesfarmers shares and Coles' forecast second-half dividend of 25
cents a share.  
 Wesfarmers' A$210 million 6 percent bonds maturing in 2009
now trade at 73 basis points more than government securities of
similar maturity, unchanged from yesterday, according to National
Australia Bank. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 ``The quality of Wesfarmers will be very attractive to
investors, but that will be balanced by whatever pricing will be
settled,'' said Sarah-Percy Dove, head of credit research at ANZ
in Sydney, who is not involved in the deal.
