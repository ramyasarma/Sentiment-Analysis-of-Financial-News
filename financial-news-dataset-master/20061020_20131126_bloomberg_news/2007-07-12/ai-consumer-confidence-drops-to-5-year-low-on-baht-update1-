             Thailand 's  consumer confidence  declined
in June to the lowest level in five years on concern baht gains and
higher fuel costs will curtail economic growth.  
 An  index  of consumer confidence slipped for an eighth straight
month to 71 from 71.4 in May, the University of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce said in Bangkok today. The June reading was the lowest
since February 2002. The gauge measures the results of a survey of
2,243 respondents nationwide.  
 ``The baht has risen to a level that may mean most Thai
exporters are unable to compete,''  Thanavath Phonvichai , an
economist at the university, told reporters in Bangkok today.
``Slowing export growth will be a very worrisome sign because it
has been the only driver of growth.''  
 An appreciation in the local currency makes the nation's
products more expensive in global markets. Thailand has been
relying on  exports , which account for 60 percent of gross domestic
product, to propel the economy as domestic consumption and
investment slow after a military coup last September.  
 ``It's inevitable that the stronger baht will hurt some
exporters,'' Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont told reporters in
Yala province, 1,080 kilometers south of Bangkok. ``The government
is concerned about this.''  
 A Thai garment supplier of  Adidas AG (ADS)  yesterday shut its
factory without notice because a stronger baht and falling orders
widened its losses, Krungthep Thurakij reported today, citing an
unidentified company official. Five thousand workers protested the
closure, demanding compensation.  
 Sales Fall  
 Companies such as  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI) ,  Thai Union
Frozen Products Pcl (TUF)  and  Hana Microelectronics Pcl (HANA)  say gains in the
baht against the dollar are curbing their sales when converted to
the local currency. The baht is at its highest level since 1997
after climbing 6.7 percent this year in onshore trading, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 PTT Pcl, the nation's biggest energy company, and other fuel
suppliers have raised gasoline prices by as much as 4.2 percent in
the past two months, according to the Energy Ministry's  Web site .
The retail price of 91-octane gasoline is the highest since August,
2006. Thailand imports almost all of is oil.  
 Consumer confidence  has fallen in all but two months since a
military junta ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's
government last September. Terrorist attacks erupted in Bangkok in
December and worsened in southern provinces after the putsch.  
 Limits on bringing money into the country imposed on Dec. 18
have eroded consumer confidence in Southeast Asia's second-largest
economy, reducing demand for imports. The currency controls also
spawned an offshore exchange rate that has risen two times faster
than the official price of the baht.  
 The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce conducts its
monthly confidence survey jointly with the Thai Chamber of Commerce,
a business organization. The results are monitored by the central
bank and the Finance Ministry to gauge consumer spending.
