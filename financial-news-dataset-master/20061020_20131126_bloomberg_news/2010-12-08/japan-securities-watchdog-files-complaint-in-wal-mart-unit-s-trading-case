Japan’s securities watchdog said it
filed a complaint with prosecutors over possible insider trading
by the husband of a former board member of  Seiyu GK , the local
unit of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.   The man and his company bought 268,000 shares of Tokyo-
based Seiyu for 23.4 million yen ($280,000) between Oct. 2 and
Oct. 19, 2007, after hearing from his wife that Wal-Mart was
about to take over the supermarket chain, the Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission said yesterday. The regulator
didn’t identify the couple in its  statement .  The price translates to an average of 87 yen per share. The
stock traded at an  average  of 90 yen when the purchases took
place, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart announced its plan on Oct. 22, 2007, to
pay 140 yen a share to take full ownership of Seiyu.  “We’re fully cooperating with authorities for their
investigation,” Kumie Wama, a Seiyu spokeswoman, said by
telephone. “We decline to comment further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
