Paris closed the Eiffel Tower and the
French capital’s airports suspended or canceled flights, as
heavy snowfalls caused transport disruptions across the country.  The Parisian landmark was closed to visitors for the day,
 Agence France-Presse  reported, amid worsening weather conditions
that hit the city’s two main airports and forced major road
closures, leading to over 100 miles of snarled traffic.  The larger Paris airport, Charles de Gaulle, reopened one
of its four runways, after halting all flights earlier. Services
ran up delays of about two hours at Orly,  Aeroports de Paris 
said. Conditions were worsened by low visibility and severe
crosswinds, said an ADP spokeswoman, who asked not be named,
citing company policy.  The delays at Charles de Gaulle came in addition to the
earlier cancelation of one in five flights ordered by France’s
 DGAC  civil-aviation authority.  Elsewhere in the country, rail and bus services and some
major roads were closed, TF1 television reported. Across the
Paris region, heavy trucks were ordered off the road.  The  SNCF  national railway ordered speed limits on some
sections of its network, leading to delays of up to 30 minutes,
spokesman Michael Chefles said by telephone. The rest of the
network was otherwise operating normally, he said.  About 5,000 police were deployed to manage traffic,
including 2,000 in the Paris region, said AFP, citing the
Interior Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
