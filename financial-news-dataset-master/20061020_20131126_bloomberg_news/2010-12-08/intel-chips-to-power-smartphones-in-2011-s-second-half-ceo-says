Intel Corp.  chips  will make their way
into smartphones from large manufacturers in the second half of
next year, Chief Executive Officer  Paul Otellini  said.  The chips will be used in “premier” smartphone brands,
Otellini said today at an investor conference in San Francisco.
He declined to name any customers.  Intel , the world’s largest semiconductor maker, is trying
to win orders from phone manufacturers to lessen its dependence
on the personal-computer market. While the company has
agreements with Nokia Oyj and  LG Electronics Inc. , there are no
phones currently on sale that use Intel processors.  The market for chips that run the radios in mobile phones,
called digital signal processors, is dominated by  Qualcomm Inc. 
Intel is entering that field through its purchase of Infineon
Technologies AG’s wireless unit. Intel is also scaling down its
PC chips to create a product called Atom to gain a foothold in
the growing business of supplying chips that run phone programs.  While Intel’s 10-year effort to capture orders in mobile
phones has yet to help its earnings, Otellini said the company
has more resources and technological capabilities than any of
its rivals.  “We can bet big,” he said. “We can do it for the long
term.”  Intel  rose  24 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $21.82 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has
gained 7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
