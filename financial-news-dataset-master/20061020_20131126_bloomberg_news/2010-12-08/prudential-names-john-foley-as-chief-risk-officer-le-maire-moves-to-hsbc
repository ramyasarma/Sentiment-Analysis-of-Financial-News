Prudential Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer, appointed  John Foley  as chief risk officer, replacing
 Thibaut Le Maire , who is moving to HSBC Holdings Plc.  Foley, the 54-year-old chief executive officer of the
insurer’s capital-management division, will take up his new
role on Jan. 1, the London-based insurer said today in a
statement. Foley will also join Prudential’s main board as an
executive director.  “The decision to make the position of group chief risk
officer a board role underlines the importance of risk
management for Prudential,” the insurer said in the statement.  Prudential is strengthening its board following its failed
$35.5 billion bid for AIA Group Ltd. earlier this year. In
October, the firm appointed  Howard Davies , former head of the
U.K. financial-services regulator, and  Paul Manduca , ex-CEO of
Rothschild Asset Management Ltd., as non-executive directors.  Foley’s salary next year will be 550,000 pounds ($865,000)
and his maximum annual bonus will be 160 percent of his base
pay, Prudential said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
