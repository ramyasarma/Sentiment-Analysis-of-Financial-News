Russia’s central bank isn’t excluding
the possibility of raising interest rates in the first quarter
of next year, Chairman  Sergey Ignatiev  said.  “Inflation is beginning to worry us,” he told reporters
today in Moscow. Annual price-growth is set to reach 8.4 percent
this year, he estimated.  A weaker ruble in recent months has affected inflation,
Ignatiev said.  Annual inflation accelerated to 8.1 percent in November,
the highest this year, after the worst drought in at least half
a century hobbled agriculture and pushed up food prices. The
central bank retracted its pledge to keep its main interest
rates at a record low “for the coming months” in a statement
on Nov. 26, when it kept the refinancing rate at 7.75 percent
for a sixth consecutive month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
