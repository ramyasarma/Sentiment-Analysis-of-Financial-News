Costco Wholesale Corp.  posted a 17
percent increase in first-quarter profit, surpassing some
analysts’ estimates, as membership fees boosted revenue for the
largest U.S. warehouse-club chain.  Net income  climbed to $312 million, or 71 cents a share, in
the quarter ended Nov. 21, from $266 million, or 60 cents, a
year earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today
in a statement. Analysts  projected  69 cents a share, the average
of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 11 percent.  Costco has lifted sales since the recession by luring
bargain-hungry consumers to pay for membership, which lets
shoppers and small businesses buy discounted goods including
groceries and televisions. Membership increased 3.6 percent to
58 million in the year through August, and fee revenue rose 10
percent to $416 million last fiscal quarter.  “The quarter continued the theme of modest gross margin
expansion, strong membership fee growth and execution on
curtailing expenses,”  Brian Sozzi , an analyst for Wall Street
Strategies Inc. in New York, said in a note to clients.
Investors may have wanted more earnings per share, which led the
stock to small drop, Sozzi said.  Costco fell 39 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $69.25 at
4:01 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
stock has risen 17 percent this year, while competitor  BJ’s
Wholesale Club Inc.  has gained 43 percent. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
the world’s largest retailer and operator of wholesaler Sam’s
Club, has climbed 2 percent in 2010.  Membership Fees Up  Costco’s  gross profit , or income after cost of goods sold,
as a percentage of total revenue rose to 12.9 percent from 12.8
percent. Selling and administrative costs as a portion of
revenue dropped 0.2 percentage points.  Sales at stores open at least a year, excluding
fluctuations in gasoline prices and currency exchange rates,
rose 5 percent,  Costco  said. Sales advanced 10 percent at the
company’s 157 stores outside the U.S. and 4 percent at its 425
locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.  Total revenue, including membership fees, rose to $19.2
billion from $17.3 billion a year earlier, the company said.
Analysts predicted $18.8 billion, the  average  of 16 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
