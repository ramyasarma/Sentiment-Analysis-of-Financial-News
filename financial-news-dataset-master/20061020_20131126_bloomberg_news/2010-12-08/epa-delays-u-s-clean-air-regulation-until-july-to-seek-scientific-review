The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency is delaying until late July tougher clean-air rules that
are opposed by businesses led by the National Association of
Manufacturers.  EPA Administrator  Lisa Jackson  plans to seek additional
information from a group of advisers to ensure the decision is
“grounded in the best science,” said  Brendan Gilfillan , an
agency spokesman, in an e-mail.  EPA proposed in January restrictions on ground-level ozone,
a key ingredient of smog, that exceeded limits adopted by the
Bush administration in 2008. The EPA said the rule would help
prevent 12,000 premature deaths, 58,000 cases of aggravated
asthma and save as much as $100 billion in health costs. The
Washington-based  National Association of Manufacturers  has said
the rule, which was to become final this month, was too strict.  “The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision leaves
thousands of Delawareans and millions of Americans unprotected
from harmful ozone air pollution under an outdated, ineffective
ozone standard,” said Senator  Tom Carper , a Delaware Democrat,
in a statement expressing disappointment by the delay.  Howard Feldman, director of regulatory and scientific
affairs for the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, said
the group welcomed the postponement. He urged the agency to
delay other “costly and unworkable proposals,” such as an
upcoming rule to limit greenhouse-gas emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
