Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, outpaced sales growth at
competitors Audi and Mercedes-Benz last month as the revamped 5-
Series sedan and new X1 sport-utility vehicle attracted buyers.  Deliveries of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce models rose 20
percent from a year earlier to 129,014 vehicles in November, the
Munich-based  automaker  said today in a statement. Sales by
 Volkswagen AG ’s Audi division increased 5.2 percent to 87,050
vehicles, the Ingolstadt, Germany-based unit said today.
Deliveries by  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz Cars, including the
Smart city-car brand, jumped 14 percent to 112,300.  Growth in China and a rebound in the U.S. are propelling a
recovery in luxury-car demand following the global recession.
The 5-Series, X1 and new Mini Countryman have given BMW extra
momentum. The November sales increase, BMW’s biggest monthly
gain this year, lifted 11-month deliveries to 1.32 million
vehicles, a gain of 14 percent.  “At BMW, you can clearly see the strong success of the new
products,” said Marc-Rene Tonn, an analyst at M.M. Warburg in
Hamburg who  recommends  buying the stock. “That will continue
with the new 6-Series next year, followed up later by the 1-
Series.”  BMW fell 3.3 percent to 61.90 euros as of the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Frankfurt, paring the stock’s  gain  this year
to 95 percent. Volkswagen’s preferred stock  fell  5.6 percent to
129.25 euros, while Daimler slipped 1.6 percent to 53.26 euros.  Audi Beats Record  Audi , which aims to overtake  BMW  as the luxury-auto sales
leader by 2015, said its deliveries in the 11 months through
November surpassed the full-year sales record set in 2008, with
more than 1 million vehicles sold.  The pace of growth slowed last month after “super”
performance a year earlier, when Audi received a boost from the
German government’s car-scrapping sales incentives, said Esther
Bahne, a spokeswoman. The brand would have reported a decline in
deliveries last month without the roughly 7,500 A1 cars that
customers bought in November, she said. The subcompact was
introduced in September.  5-Series Sales Jump  BMW’s revamp of the 5-Series boosted  deliveries  of the
sedan by 87 percent to 20,702 cars. BMW sold 9,160 X1s, topping
100,000 deliveries for the SUV since it was introduced in
October 2009. The Mini brand sold 4,165 units of the Countryman,
which went on sale in September as the division’s first four-
door model. The model accounted for 20 percent of Mini sales
last month, BMW said.  The BMW brand defended its lead this year with 11-month
sales rising 15 percent to 1.11 million vehicles. Daimler’s
 Mercedes-Benz  brand increased sales 16 percent to 1.06 million
vehicles in the period, while Audi deliveries climbed 15 percent
to 1,003,900 cars and SUVs.  “BMW is well on its way to reaching its target of more
than 1.4 million units this year,”  Ian Robertson , the
manufacturer’s sales chief, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
