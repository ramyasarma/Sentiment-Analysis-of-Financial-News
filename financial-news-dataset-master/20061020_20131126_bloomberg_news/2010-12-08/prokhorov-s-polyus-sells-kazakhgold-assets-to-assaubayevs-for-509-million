OAO Polyus Gold , Russia’s largest
producer of the metal, said it sold the main production assets
of its KazakhGold Group Ltd. unit to Kazakhstan’s Assaubayev
family for $509 million in cash.  The Assaubayev family will also pay Polyus for investments
in KazakhGold’s assets and guarantee the company’s Eurobonds,
Moscow-based Polyus said on its website today. Both sides agreed
to drop all legal proceedings against each other, according to
the statement.  Polyus, controlled by billionaires Mikhail Prokhorov and
Suleiman Kerimov, said it will keep Jersey-based KazakhGold as a
corporate entity and merge with it to get a primary listing on
the London Stock Exchange, giving the company access to a wider
range of investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
