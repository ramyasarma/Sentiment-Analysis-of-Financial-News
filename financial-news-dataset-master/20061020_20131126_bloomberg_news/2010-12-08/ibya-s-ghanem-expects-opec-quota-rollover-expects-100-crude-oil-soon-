The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will keep its production quotas unchanged as
oil gets ready to hit $100 a barrel, Shokri Ghanem, chairman of
Libya’s National Oil Corp., said.  OPEC, which is scheduled to gather Dec. 11 in Quito,
Ecuador, will probably agree to a quota rollover and will focus
on discussing compliance during this meeting, Ghanem said today
at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. The price of oil will increase
to $100 “pretty soon,” and once that happens OPEC may alter
its production strategy, he said.  “We’ve had output unchanged now since December 2008 and I
think if we breach $100 next year we could see some relaxation
in the quota,” Ghanem said before boarding the plane that will
take him to the Ecuadorian capital.  Crude oil futures rose 3.3 percent last month on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and exceeded $90 a barrel on Dec. 7 for
the first time in two years.  Ali al-Naimi , oil minister for
Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, said Nov. 1 that crude-
importing countries are happy with prices between $70 and $90 a
barrel, a higher range than the spread of $70 to $80 he cited
previously.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
