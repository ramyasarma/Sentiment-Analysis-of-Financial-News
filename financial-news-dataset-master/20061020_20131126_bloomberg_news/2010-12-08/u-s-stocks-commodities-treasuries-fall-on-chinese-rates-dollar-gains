U.S. stocks retreated, led by
commodity producers, while a stronger dollar weighed on prices
of oil and raw materials as concern China will raise interest
rates overshadowed optimism about the potential extension of
American tax cuts. Treasuries slid, sending the 10-year yield to
the highest since June.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,218.93 at 10:42 a.m. in New York, erasing an early gain of 0.4
percent. The Dollar Index climbed for a third day, rising 0.5
percent to 80.251. The S&P GSCI index of commodities tumbled 1
percent and the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 14 basis points to
3.27 percent..  “We’re trying to digest everything,” said Jack Ablin,
chief investment officer at Chicago-based Harris Private Bank,
which oversees $55 billion. “The Obama tax accord might be a
near-term positive, but there’s China concern offsetting
it. China does need to cool down a little. Even though I believe
they will level off gradually, investors get spooked every time
they hear about higher interest rates. That’s dragging stocks
and commodities.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
