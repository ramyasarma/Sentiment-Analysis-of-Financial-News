Treasuries dropped, pushing yields on
10-year notes up the most over two days since September 2008, on
optimism the global economic recovery is gathering pace.  U.S. debt remained lower after the government sold
$21 billion of 10-year notes in the second of three sales this
week totaling $66 billion two days after President  Barack Obama 
agreed to extend his predecessor’s tax cuts for two years.  “Some investors seem hesitant to buy,” said  Michael Pond ,
co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Barclays Plc, a
primary dealer, before the auction. After the tax-cut agreement,
traders may have “a lower expectation for how much the Fed
purchases over time,” he said.  The yield on the 10-year note rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 3.30 percent at 1:04 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data.  At today’s auction, the securities drew a  yield  of 3.340
percent, compared with the average forecast of 3.307 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of 7 of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary
dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.92. The average at the last 10 auctions was 3.12.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 44.4 percent of the notes,
compared with 56.6 percent in November, the most since the
Treasury began releasing the data in 2003. The average for the
past 10 sales is 43.4 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 11.4 percent of
the debt, compared with 9.4 percent at the November offering and
a 10-sale average of 13.3 percent.  The sale was a reopening of the Nov. 9 auction of 10-year
notes, which drew yield of 2.636 percent.  Debt Returns  Treasury 10-year notes have returned 9.1 percent this year,
compared with 6.2 percent for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Yields on German bunds rose above 3 percent for the first
time since May, and Japanese  five-year  note yields jumped the
most in more than two years.  Yesterday’s $32 billion auction of three-year debt drew the
lowest demand since February. The U.S. will sell $13 billion of
30-year debt tomorrow, completing this week’s $66 billion of
note and bond sales.  Obama agreed on the two-year extension of current tax rates
in exchange for another 13 months of federal unemployment
insurance for the long-term jobless and cutting the payroll tax
by $120 billion for one year. The president said he would accept
a lower rate for the estate tax than Democrats wanted in order
to break a stalemate over extending  George W. Bush ’s tax cuts.  ‘More Relief’  “It’s no doubt that this is more relief than most expected
in the market, particularly with the payroll taxes,” said  Russ Certo , a managing director and co-head of rates trading at
Gleacher & Company in New York. “A concept that is worth noting
is higher rates could threaten the housing recovery. I don’t
think it’s anyone’s intention to have higher rates cut off the
benefits we are getting from the tax situation.”  The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and those on
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the securities
known as the break-even rate, increased today to as much as 2.29
percentage points, the widest since May 13.  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, gained five basis points to 2.99 percent,
after reaching 3.03 percent, the highest since May 4.  Japan’s five-year note  yield  jumped 10 basis points to
0.524 percent in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The increase in yields was the
biggest since June 11, 2008, Bloomberg data showed.  The Fed bought today $1.63 billion of inflation-protected
securities maturing from July 2012 to February 2040 today as
part of an asset-purchase program aimed at lowering borrowing
costs and stimulating economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
