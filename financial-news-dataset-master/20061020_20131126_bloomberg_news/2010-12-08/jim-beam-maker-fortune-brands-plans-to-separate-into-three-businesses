Fortune Brands Inc., the maker of
Courvoisier cognac, Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf balls, 
plans to split into three businesses to focus on its spirits 
division after investor William Ackman built up a holding.  Fortune will spin off its home and security division into a
publicly traded company and either sell or spin off its golf
business, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said in a
statement today.  “We are taking the next logical step in the evolution of
Fortune Brands, which we believe will maximize long-term value
for our shareholders and create exciting opportunities within
our businesses,” Bruce Carbonari, chairman and chief executive
officer of Fortune Brands, said in the statement.  Activist investor Ackman, who previously pushed for change
at Target Corp. and Wendy’s International Inc., disclosed an 11
percent stake in Fortune Brands two months ago. Fortune found
“much strategic common ground,” with Ackman’s Pershing Square
Capital Management, the company said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
