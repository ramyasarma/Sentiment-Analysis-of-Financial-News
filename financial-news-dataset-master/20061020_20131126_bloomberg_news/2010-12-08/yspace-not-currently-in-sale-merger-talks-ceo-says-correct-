MySpace, the social network owned by
News Corp., isn’t currently in discussions over a possible sale
or merger, according to  Mike Jones , the website’s chief
executive officer.  In comments on the sidelines of the “LeWeb” conference in
Paris, Jones said News Corp. will give MySpace “enough time”
for a makeover. He said the success of the newly redesigned
website will become clear in January or February.  “I will be involved in any discussions that happen,”
Jones said in the interview. “Right now there are no
discussions.”  At a conference last week,  News Corp.  Chief Operating
Officer  Chase Carey  said the company is open to all options for
Beverly Hills, California-based MySpace, including a possible
sale, according to a report from Reuters.  News Corp., which bought MySpace for $580 million in 2005,
is pushing the website to become profitable after it fell behind
Facebook in users. On a Nov. 3 conference call, a week after
MySpace introduced its redesign, Carey said that MySpace’s
losses “are not acceptable or sustainable.”  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , fell 8 cents to $14.28 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares have gained
4.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
