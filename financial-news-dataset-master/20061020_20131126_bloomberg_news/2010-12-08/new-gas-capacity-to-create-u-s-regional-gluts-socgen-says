New natural gas production capacity
coming on-stream next year in North America will create a supply
glut in places such as the northern Rockies, Louisiana and
Pennsylvania, Societe Generale said in a research note.  As much as 13.7 billion cubic feet a day of new natural gas
production capacity expected to come online in the first half of
2011, and new pipelines increasing supply, will add to pressure
on prices, Societe Generale analysts said in a note yesterday.  Shale drilling, where rock formations are horizontally
drilled and fractured using water and chemicals under high
pressure, is driving a surge in U.S. natural-gas output. It last
year made the country the world’s largest gas producer,
overtaking Russia, and drove prices lower.  According to the French bank, the Dec. 1 start of the Tiger
Pipeline, with a capacity of 2 billion cubic feet a day, will
allow to move natural gas from lucrative wells in Haynesville
Shale play in Louisiana toward end markets in the Midwest and
Northeast. Another pipeline, the southbound Acadian Haynesville
extension, will come online before the end of 2011 providing a
transport route from Louisiana to Florida and cutting inbound
flows from Texas, the bank said.  “This depressed picture should eventually affect Henry
Hub, since flows are likely to increase toward southeastern
Louisiana with the changing price dynamic,” Societe Generale
said.  The French bank on Nov. 3 revised downwards its 2011
natural gas price forecast to $3.56 per million British thermal
units from the previous $3.75.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marek Strzelecki in
