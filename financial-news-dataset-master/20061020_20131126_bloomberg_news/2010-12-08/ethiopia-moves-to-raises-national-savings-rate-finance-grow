The Ethiopian central bank’s decision
to raise the minimum deposit rate at commercial banks to 5
percent from 4 percent and create government bonds for
individual savers aims to boost the country’s low savings rate,
a bank official said.  The nation saved 2.3 percent of its gross domestic product
in 2009, according to  World Bank  statistics. Its neighbors Kenya
and Sudan saved 9.7 percent and 25.7 percent respectively.  “It is assumed there are a lot of savings outside the
banking system,” Alemayehu Kebede, a spokesman for the central
bank, said in an interview in the capital, Addis Ababa,
yesterday. “These measures will attract those savings,
especially in rural areas.”  Increased savings would help the government finance its
five-year growth plan that aims to boost growth to as much as
14.9 percent a year, Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi  said on Dec. 2.  The National Bank of Ethiopia raised the deposit rate at
all financial institutions effective from Dec. 2. Also
introduced were inflation-linked government bonds starting at
500 birr ($30) that will pay an initial rate of 5.5 percent when
held for up to five years, and six percent for longer.  Credit caps placed on banks to try and stem inflation that
peaked at 64 percent in July 2008 will be “lifted in a very
short period of time,” Alemayehu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
