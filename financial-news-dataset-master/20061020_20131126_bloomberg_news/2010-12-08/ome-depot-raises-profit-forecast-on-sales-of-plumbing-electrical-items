Home Depot Inc. , the world’s largest
home-improvement retailer, increased its full-year profit
forecast on stronger fourth-quarter demand for plumbing and
electrical items and Christmas trees.  Home Depot expects to  earn  $1.97 a share in the year ending
Jan. 30, the Atlanta-based retailer said in a statement today,
raising a forecast of $1.94 made on Nov. 16. Analysts predicted
$1.95, the average of 23  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales for the year will rise about 2.3 percent, up from 2.2
percent, helped by a “terrific Black Friday,” Chief Financial
Officer  Carol Tome  said today, referring to the shopping day
after Thanksgiving. Sales of seasonal merchandise including
Christmas trees are higher, she said.  “As we look at November into December, we see strength
across the store,” Tome said by telephone from Boston where
Home Depot is holding an analysts’ meeting. “Ordinarily we
wouldn’t lift guidance so early in a quarter, but we feel more
than confident of the guidance we are giving today.”  The retailer earned $1.55 from continuing operations in
2009.  Home Depot rose 48 cents to $34.03 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 18
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
