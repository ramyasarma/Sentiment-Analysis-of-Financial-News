Cattle prices that touched a 27-month
high in Chicago yesterday may be headed for the biggest monthly
decline in two years, based on a technical analysis by  Doug Harper , an analyst at Richard A. Brock & Associates.  Futures touched $1.07325 a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange yesterday, the highest since Aug. 15, 2008, and then
fell to $1.045. Cattle’s price swing created a “very negative
chart formation” as the intraday high exceeded the previous
day’s peak, and the low was less than the nadir on Dec. 6, he
said. That signaled the commodity may drop as much as 5 cents to
99.55 cents by Dec. 25, Harper said.  “What a downside reversal really represents is a change in
momentum,” Harper said by telephone from Milwaukee. “We’ve had
strong upward momentum the last couple of weeks. This suggests
that pendulum has swung to the downside.”  The fact that yesterday’s high marked a new contract high
makes it a “key reversal, which is an even stronger signal”
that prices will decline, Harper said. Futures may have put in
an “intermediate-term top,” after rallying 21 percent this
year, he said.  Cattle futures for February delivery dropped 1.875 cents
yesterday, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $1.0455 a pound, the
biggest decline since Sept. 22. A drop to 99.55 cents by the end
of December would mark a 6.4 percent slide for the month, the
biggest since a 7.6 percent plunge in October 2008.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
