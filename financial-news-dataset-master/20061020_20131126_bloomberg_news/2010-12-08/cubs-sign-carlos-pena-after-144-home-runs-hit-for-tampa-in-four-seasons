Carlos Pena  signed a one-year
contract with the Chicago Cubs after hitting 144 home runs for
the Tampa Bay Rays over the past four seasons.  Pena, 32, is coming off a season in which he had a career-
low .196 batting average with 28 homers and 84 runs batted in.
The left-handed-hitting first baseman was voted an All-Star in
2009, when his 39 home runs tied  Mark Teixeira  of the New York
Yankees for the American League lead.  The Cubs didn’t disclose financial terms of Pena’s
contract.  MLB.com  said Pena will get $10 million next season,
without disclosing where it got the information.  A 10-year Major League Baseball veteran, Pena helped the
Rays reach the World Series in 2008, when he hit .247 with 31
home runs and 102 RBI. Pena’s best season was in 2007, when he
batted .282 with 46 homers and 121 RBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
