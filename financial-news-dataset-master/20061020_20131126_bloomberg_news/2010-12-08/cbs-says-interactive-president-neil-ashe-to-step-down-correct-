CBS Corp.  said  Neil Ashe , president
of the media company’s interactive unit, is stepping down two
years after joining as part of the acquisition of  Cnet Networks
Inc.   Ashe, 42, will leave the company next year,  Dana McClintock , a spokesman for CBS, said today in an e-mail. The
departure was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal’s All
Things D blog.  “Neil has helped make CBSi into the successful and
profitable business it is today,” New York-based CBS said today
in a statement, referring to CBS Interactive. “Looking out into
2011, we are working on a relaxed timeframe to name a successor
to his post, as he embarks on his next great thing.”  Ashe was previously chief executive officer of Cnet, the
online publisher of technology news and reviews. He joined CBS
when it bought Cnet in 2008 for $1.8 billion.  Quincy Smith 
stepped down as CEO of CBS Interactive at the end of 2009 to
start an advisory business, Code Advisors, and wasn’t replaced.  Display advertising  revenue  at CBS Interactive, which
includes Cnet, CBS.com and TV.com, increased 17 percent in the
third quarter, according to the company’s regulatory filing. CBS
doesn’t break out further financial results for the unit.  CBS rose 9 cents to $17.98 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have  gained  28 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
