U.K. Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt 
announced an 80 million pound ($120 million) matching fund to
boost cultural philanthropy, saying the rich in Britain gave six
times less to the arts than their U.S. equivalents.  In a speech at the JPMorgan Chase & Co. offices in London
today, Hunt said his purpose was not to find a substitute for
government grants, nor was it “importing a U.S. model wholesale
into the U.K.”  “Surely we must ask ourselves what we can learn from a
country in which cultural giving per capita is 37 pounds a month
compared to just 6 pounds in the U.K.?” he said.  Hunt’s department is having its budget cut to 1.1 billion
pounds by 2015. National museums will get grants reduced by 15
percent over the period.  Far deeper cuts of 29 percent will be sustained by Arts
Council England, the body that funnels government subsidies to
performing-arts groups and non-national museums in England. Its
regularly funded organizations include the  Royal Opera House ,
the National Theatre, Sadler’s Wells Theatre and the Serpentine
Gallery.  With the U.K. facing the deepest public spending cuts since
World War II, the government is keen to make the wealthy dig
into their pockets more.  Of the 80 million pounds in the matching fund announced
today, 50 million pounds will come from a five-year package of
lottery funding provided to Arts Council England.  The matching fund means that for every 1 pound given, the
government will put in an equivalent amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
