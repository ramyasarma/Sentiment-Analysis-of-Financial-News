MasterCard Inc. , the world’s second-
biggest payments processor, said its website was slowed by a
“flood” of traffic after the company blocked use of its
network by WikiLeaks.  The MasterCard  website  was knocked offline today in a so-
called denial-of-service attack orchestrated by Anonymous, an
“Internet vigilante group,” and users of 4Chan, a network of
uncensored message boards, TechCrunch  reported . In a  post  on
Twitter that referred to WikiLeaks, Anonymous dubbed the move
“Operation Payback.” The group also  claimed  responsibility for
taking down  Visa Inc. ’s website later in the day.  “The issue appears to be the result of a concentrated
effort to flood our corporate website with traffic and slow
access,” said James Issokson, a spokesman for Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard, in an e-mail. MasterCard’s systems
haven’t been compromised and “there is no impact on our
cardholders’ ability to use their cards for secure transactions
globally,” he said.  MasterCard and London-based Visa Europe Ltd. said yesterday
that they are suspending use of their networks by WikiLeaks, an
organization that publishes secret documents on its website. The
actions are the latest in a series by companies that may crimp
access to funds for WikiLeaks, a nonprofit that relies on
donations.  ‘Political Pressure’  EBay Inc.  unit PayPal recently cut off WikiLeaks for
violating the online payment processor’s acceptable use policy.
PostFinance, the banking arm of SwissPost, closed a bank account
held by WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange , saying he doesn’t
qualify to be a client.  Amazon.com Inc.  dropped WikiLeaks from
its website-hosting service for breaching terms of service.  Visa Europe, the biggest payment-card network in the 27-
member European Union, is bowing to “political pressure to
close us down,” said Andreas Fink, chief executive officer of
Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell ehf, a company that helps
WikiLeaks accept donations online.  “The suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a
violation of the agreements with their customers,” Fink said in
a  statement  on the company’s website, in which he vowed legal
action to keep contributions flowing. “Visa users have
explicitly expressed their will to send their donations to
WikiLeaks and Visa is not fulfilling this wish.”  Simon Kleine, a spokesman for Visa Europe, declined to
comment beyond a company statement yesterday that said it had
suspended payment acceptance on WikiLeaks’ website “pending
further investigation into the nature of its business and
whether it contravenes Visa operating rules.”  Assange Arrested  Visa Europe split from Visa Inc., the world’s biggest
payments network, before the San Francisco-based company’s
initial public offering in March 2008.  Chris Monteiro , MasterCard’s chief spokesman, has said that
the company didn’t receive a request from the U.S. government or
any third party before cutting off WikiLeaks. “This decision
was MasterCard’s alone,” he said yesterday.  Visa Inc.’s website was “experiencing heavier than normal
traffic,” said Ted Carr, a spokesman. “The company is taking
steps to restore the site to full operations.”  Assange, 39, was arrested in the U.K. yesterday after
Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant on rape
allegations. Assange, who denies the charges, challenged the
request to turn him over to Swedish authorities.  Since it began releasing thousands of secret U.S. military
and State Department documents on Nov. 28, WikiLeaks also has
faced denial-of-service attacks, where hackers attempt to
overwhelm a website with repeated requests for data.  MasterCard climbed $3.86, or 1.6 percent, to $250.64 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have declined 2.1 percent this year. Visa Inc. advanced
1.4 percent to $77.94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
