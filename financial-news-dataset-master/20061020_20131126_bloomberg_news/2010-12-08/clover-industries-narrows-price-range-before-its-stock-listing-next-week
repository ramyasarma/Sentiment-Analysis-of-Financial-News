Clover Industries Ltd. , South
Africa’s largest milk and cheese supplier, is selling shares in
a narrower pricing range ahead of its planned Dec. 14 listing on
the Johannesburg stock exchange.  The 10-rand to 11-rand range is at the midpoint of the 9-
rand to 12-rand range that Clover initially expected, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer  Manie Roode  said today by telephone from
Johannesburg, where the company is based. The offer closes at 4
p.m. local time today.  Clover, raising funds to expand production, reorganize
logistics and reduce debt, said it will offer about 47.6 million
shares to selected investors in the bookbuild. The company would
raise 500 million rand ($72 million) if all shares were sold at
the midpoint of the narrowed range.  Clover plans to invest 350 million rand in boosting
production and efficiency and may repay as much as 130 million
rand of debt from the funds raised, CEO  Johann Vorster  said last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
