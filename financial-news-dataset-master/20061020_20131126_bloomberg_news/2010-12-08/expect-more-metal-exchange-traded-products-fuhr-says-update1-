More exchange-traded products based
on metals are likely as suppliers of other commodities seek the
same boost that gold has received in the market, BlackRock
Inc.’s  Deborah Fuhr  said.  “Everyone seems to want to get involved in the exchange-
traded-product area, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see others,
particularly on the metals side, come to market,” Fuhr, global
head of ETF research and implementation strategy for BlackRock,
said at a Bloomberg Link forum in Toronto today.  The assets of the world’s commodity exchange-traded
products increased to $159.3 billion in October from $7 billion
at the end of 2005, according to BlackRock. Seventy-six percent
of the assets were in precious-metal products.  Gold futures have outperformed an index of Canadian gold
companies’ stocks, 167 percent to 88 percent, since the end of
2005, as exchange-traded products made it easier to invest in
physical gold.  BlackRock, ETF Securities Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
have said they plan to start funds backed by copper, the world’s
third-most widely used metal behind iron and aluminum.  Fuhr said she couldn’t comment on what other commodities
might back exchange-traded products. Some items would make poor
candidates for products backed by physical commodities.  “You’re not going to have a warehouse where you’re
sticking cattle or lean hogs,” she said.  BlackRock, based in New York, oversees $3.45 trillion.  Editors: Stephen Kleege, Joanna Ossinger  To contact the reporter on this story;
