The Australian dollar strengthened
against most of its major counterparts after a government report
showed employers added more than twice as many jobs as
economists forecast.  Australia’s currency gained for the first time in four days
against the greenback as the  extra yield  the South Pacific
nation’s bonds offer compared with Treasuries widened and
traders added to bets the central bank will boost interest
rates. New Zealand’s dollar fell for a second day against
Australia’s after the smaller country’s central bank said
borrowing costs will likely rise “to a more limited extent”
during the next two years.  “This is significant data and it supports the Australian
dollar,” said  Robert Rennie , head of currency research in
Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest
lender. “The market is more or less fully priced for a hike by
September next year, today’s data suggests that you probably
want to start bringing that forward.”  Australia’s currency rose 0.3 percent to 98.29 U.S. cents
as of 11:35 a.m. in New York from 97.96 yesterday, after
weakening 1.4 percent in the past three days. The Aussie gained
0.3 percent to 82.54 yen, and appreciated 0.5 percent to
NZ$1.3173.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to 74.65 U.S. cents,
and traded at 62.66 yen from 62.82 yen.  Australia’s currency rallied after the statistics bureau
said employers added 54,600 workers in November, reducing the
 unemployment rate  to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in October.
Economists forecast 20,000 extra jobs, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  Rate Outlook  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will
increase the benchmark rate by about 40 basis points during the
next 12 months, up from a prediction of 24 basis points at the
end of last week, according to a Credit Suisse AG  index .  New Zealand’s dollar slid to a six-week low against
Australia’s as economists from Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and TD
Securities Inc. set back their predictions for when the central
bank will resume raising rates.  The kiwi fell as low as NZ$1.3216 per Australian dollar,
the weakest since Oct. 25.  Governor  Alan Bollard  left New Zealand’s benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 3 percent, saying the nation’s worst
earthquake in 80 years may curb economic growth in the near
term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
