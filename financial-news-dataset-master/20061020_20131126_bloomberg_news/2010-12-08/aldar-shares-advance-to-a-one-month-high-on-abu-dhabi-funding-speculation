Aldar Properties PJSC  rose the most
in more than eight months as investors expect government support
for Abu Dhabi’s largest developer to be “shareholder
friendly,” Daman Investments PSC said.  The  shares  gained 7 percent, the most since March 28, to
2.45 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi. Aldar has lost 51
percent this year.  “We have said before we will give the framework in the
fourth quarter,” Chief Financial Officer  Shafqat Ali Malik  said
in a telephone interview today, declining to provide details.
Aldar said Nov. 9 it is in the “final stages of discussions”
with the Abu Dhabi government regarding the company’s funding
requirements and expects to reach a “framework” by the end of
the year.  About 80 million shares traded today, compared with 11.6
million shares yesterday. “From the heightened trading
activity, it seems the market view is that there will be a
shareholder friendly” outcome for the company’s cash needs,
said  Shehzad Janab , asset management head at Dubai-based Daman.  Aldar sold assets on Yas Island to the emirate’s government
for 9.14 billion dirhams ($2.5 billion), it said in March. The
company has 22.4 billion dirhams of debt outstanding, including
11.8 billion dirhams due in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  -- Editors:  Shanthy Nambiar ,  Claudia Maedler   To contact the reporters on this story:
