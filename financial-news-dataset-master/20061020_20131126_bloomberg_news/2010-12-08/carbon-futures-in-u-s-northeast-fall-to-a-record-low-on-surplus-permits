Northeast’s carbon cap-and-trade program for power plants fell
to a record low amid a surplus of pollution permits.  December-delivered permits from the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative fell 2 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.87 each on the
 Chicago Climate Futures Exchange  today. Each permit represents
one ton of carbon dioxide.  Northeast carbon-dioxide futures have fallen 19 percent
this year. The carbon market created by the regional cap-and-
trade program is “oversupplied,”  Paul Tesoriero , director of
environmental trading at  Evolution Markets LLC  in White Plains,
New York, said in a telephone interview.  A gap between the output of carbon dioxide from power
plants and the number of pollution rights being issued by the
Northeast states has created a surplus of permits. The states
decided in 2005 how many permits to issue and left room for
emissions to rise before trading started two years ago.  Instead, emissions fell as the economy slowed and natural
gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, became cheaper for power
plants.  Last week, the 10 states that run the regional carbon-
trading program auctioned 25.9 million permits for $1.86 each,
the minimum allowable bid. An additional 19.4 million permits
that were offered at the auction didn’t sell.  Screen trading on the Chicago exchange is “relatively
light” compared with the over-the-counter market, where permits
today were priced from $1.87 to $1.90 each, Tesoriero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
