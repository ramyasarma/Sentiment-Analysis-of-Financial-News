Irish 10-year bonds opened little
changed, reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The 10-year Irish yield was less than one basis point lower
at 8.21 percent as of 7:35 a.m. in London, while the benchmark
German  bund yield  rose seven basis points to 3.01 percent.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds increased eight basis
points to 5.30 percent and similar-maturity Italian yields
climbed six basis points to 4.58 percent.  Greek 10-year bond yields were little changed at 11.80
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
