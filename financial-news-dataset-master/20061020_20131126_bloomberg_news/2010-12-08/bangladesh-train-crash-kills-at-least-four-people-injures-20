At least four people were killed and
20 injured when two passenger trains collided in Bangladesh’s
Narsingdi district, local police said.  “We fear there are more dead people,” Mohammed Akkasuddin,
the district’s superintendent of police, said in a telephone
interview. Police and rescuers workers are still combing the
wreckage, he said.  The accident took place at around 5 p.m. local time killing
at least 19 people and injuring more than 300, Xinhua news
agency reported separately, citing police officials. The area
where the trains collided is 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of
Dhaka, the capital.  Outdated signaling systems and poor track maintenance often
cause train accidents in Bangladesh. In 2008, a train collided
with a bus at a railway crossing in central Bangladesh killing
17 people and injuring 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
