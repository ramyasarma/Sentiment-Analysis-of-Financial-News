Australia’s weather bureau is warning
of severe thunderstorms in six of the nation’s eight states and
territories as New South Wales, already suffering from the worst
flooding in 20 years, braces for further rain.  The Bureau of Meteorology has severe thunderstorm warnings
in place for all states and territories apart from Tasmania and
Western Australia, according to information on its  website .
North-east Victoria faces damaging winds, heavy rainfall, flash
flooding and large hailstones in the coming hours, the bureau
said in a warning issued at 6:49 p.m. local time.  Australia had its wettest September-to-November spring on
record, weather bureau data show. Heavy rain and flooding, the
worst in two decades, has isolated hundreds of people in New
South Wales and forced 750 people to evacuate their homes,
according to the  State Emergency Service .  Residents across parts of New South Wales, Australia’s most
populous state, may experience very heavy rainfall, flash
flooding and damaging winds over the next few hours, the weather
bureau said in a warning at 6:43 p.m. local time.  Floodwater may enter properties in the central district of
Dubbo over the next few days as the Macquarie River rises,
according to the SES.  Rain has depleted stockpiles at mines, disrupting
deliveries of coal to the Dalrymple Bay export terminal at Hay
Point port in Queensland state, General Manager Greg Smith said
by telephone today.  Melbourne experienced minor flash flooding today, the
Herald Sun newspaper reported on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
