Senegal’s former Prime Minister
 Idrissa Seck  will challenge President Abdoulaye Wade for the
ruling party’s nomination for the 2012 presidential elections,
le Pop reported.  Seck told reporters he is the only constitutionally
eligible candidate contesting the ruling party’s primary, the
Dakar-based newspaper said. President  Abdoulaye Wade’s  bid for a
third term in office is “unconstitutional,” he said.  Wade, 84, said he will contest the election as the party’s
candidate and won’t cede the position to his son, Karim Wade,
who is the minister for air transportation, infrastructure,
international cooperation and energy, the newspaper reported.
He said 63 of the party’s 66 delegates have pledged support for
him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
