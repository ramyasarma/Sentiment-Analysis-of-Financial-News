Pakistan may ship as much as 2
million metric tons of wheat in the next six months after the
government lifted its export ban, Agrocorp International
Managing Director  Vijay Iyengar  said.  The shipments would be without export subsidies and go to
nearby countries and Indonesia, Iyengar said at an interview
today at a grains conference in Perth, citing market speculation.
The country removed its shipment ban, the government’s finance
committee said in a statement yesterday. The committee, headed
by Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, met in Islamabad.  Supplies of milling-quality wheat have been curbed by
drought in the Black Sea region and rains earlier this year in
Canada and Germany. A lot of buyers delayed purchases on
expectation of plentiful supplies from Australia, where heavy
rain has delayed the harvest and hurt quality, Iyengar said.  “It’s going to take a little bit of time before the
Australian situation is clear,” he said. “The next two or
three weeks will be critical.”  Wheat futures fell 1.6 percent to $7.7225 a bushel at 12:40
p.m. in Singapore, after gaining to a four-month high this week
amid concerns about supply from Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
