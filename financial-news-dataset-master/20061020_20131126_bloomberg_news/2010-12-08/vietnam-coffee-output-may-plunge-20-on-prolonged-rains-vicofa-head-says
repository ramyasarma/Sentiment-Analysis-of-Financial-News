Coffee output for the 2010-2011 crop
year in Vietnam, the world’s biggest grower of robusta beans
used in instant drinks, will decline about 20 percent from the
previous harvest of 1.1 million metric tons as prolonged rains
hurt crops, Luong Van Tu, chairman of the Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa
Association, said before a conference today in Ho Chi Minh City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
