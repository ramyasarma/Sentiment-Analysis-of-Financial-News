Russia sold more bonds than it
offered for the first time ever, accepting the highest yield in
six months, as the prospect of rising interest rates increases
the cost of financing its budget deficit.  The Finance Ministry  sold  6.5 billion rubles ($209 million)
of notes due in August 2012 yesterday, more than the 5.9 billion
rubles planned, at a yield of 6.1 percent, the highest since
June 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The government
also issued 10.4 billion rubles of the so-called OFZs due in
July 2015 at a yield of 7.26 percent, the highest end of
guidance given Dec. 7.  Inflation that the government expects to exceed its 8
percent target this year is starting to “worry” the central
bank, Bank Rossii Chairman  Sergei Ignatiev  said yesterday.
Traders expect record-low benchmark rates to climb by more than
half a percentage point from as low as 2.5 percent during the
next three months, according to forward-rate agreements, after
14 cuts between April 2009 and May this year.  “With monetary tightening on the horizon in the first
quarter and higher inflation they have to offer a higher
premium,”  Dmitry Gourov , an emerging-markets strategist at
UniCredit SpA, said by phone from Vienna yesterday. “OFZs will
become an even better buy next year when rates go higher.”  Brazil offered investors a yield of 12.208 percent on its
domestic bonds due in January 2015 last week, 2 basis points
from the highest rate since the securities were first sold in
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
the South American country’s bonds in reais due in January 2014
yield 12.385 percent, up from 11.373 percent when they were last
offered in August, the data show.  Brazilian Rates  Traders in the interest-rate futures market are betting
Brazil will raise its benchmark rate by at least 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 11 percent in January,
Bloomberg data show. The central bank held the benchmark rate at
10.75 percent yesterday. Consumer prices rose 5.63 percent in
November from a year earlier, the highest level since February
2009. The central bank targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus 2 percentage points.  Russia has sold 558 billion rubles of OFZs this year, or 67
percent of the 839 billion rubles targeted for 2010, based on
 central bank  data.  “The Finance Ministry has a big bag of debt it still
hasn’t placed and that’s the reason they sold more this week,”
 Konstantin Kostrub , the head of fixed-income trading at ING
Groep NV, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. The auction
marked the first time the government sold more debt than
scheduled, he said.  Spending Reserves  The government has tapped its Reserve Fund, one of two
sovereign wealth funds, to finance the country’s second budget
deficit since 1999. That fund dropped 33 percent this year to
$40.9 billion. The government plans to spend $20 billion from
the fund in December and $10 billion next year, Deputy Finance
Minister  Dmitry Pankin  said at a conference in London on Nov.
30.  “Ideally the government would not have to use the Reserve
Fund,” Kostrub said. “It’s in the Finance Ministry’s interest
to place at such levels,” he said, referring to yesterday’s
increased sale of OFZs.  The ruble was little changed at 31.0449 per dollar by 1:03
p.m. in Moscow today, after earlier surging to the highest level
since Nov. 19. Non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs, which provide
a guide to expectations of currency movements and interest rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against currency
movements, show the ruble at 31.3078 per dollar in three months.  Extra Yield  Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose for the first day
this week, pushing the yield 11 basis points lower to 4.82
percent. The price of country’s ruble notes due August 2016 also
gained, leaving the yield unchanged at 7.31 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries fell 3 basis points to 196,
according to JPMorgan EMBI+ Indexes. The so-called spread
compares with 128 for debt of similarly rated Mexico and 166 for
Brazil, which is rated two steps lower at Baa3 by Moody’s.  The  spread  on Russian bonds is 32 basis points below the
average for emerging markets, down from a 15-month high of 105
in February, according to JPMorgan Indexes.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell 1 basis point to 143
points today, down from this year’s peak of 217, according to
data provider CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  Overnight Rates  Credit-default swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-lowest investment grade rating,
cost 17 basis points more than contracts for Turkey, which is
rated four levels lower at Ba2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40
basis points less on April 20.  Overnight interbank rates on ruble deposits surged to 5
percent on Nov. 30, the highest level since Jan. 25. MosPrime,
the average rate Russian banks charge to lend money to each
other overnight, hit an 11-month high of 4.78 percent last week.
 Ruonia , the average rate 31 banks charge to lend rubles to one
another, reached 4.43 percent, the highest since March 30.  The  Finance Ministry  said Nov. 23 it delayed a Dec. 1
auction to sell 15.2 billion rubles of November 2014 bonds and
10.5 billion rubles of June 2011 securities until Dec. 22 as
Europe’s debt crisis and the weakening ruble spurred investors
to shun local-currency debt. The government sold 29.4 billion
rubles, or 83 percent of the 35.5 billion rubles of bonds it
offered in a Nov. 24 auction.  Russia’s year-on-year inflation rate rose for a fourth
month in November, to 8.1 percent, the highest level since
December 2009. Russia’s central bank has a “free hand” to
start raising borrowing costs, Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman
 Alexei Ulyukayev  told a conference in Munich on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
