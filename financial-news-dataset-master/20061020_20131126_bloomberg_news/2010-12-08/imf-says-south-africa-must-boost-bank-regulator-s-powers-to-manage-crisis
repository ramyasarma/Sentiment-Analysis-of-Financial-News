South Africa should strengthen the
powers of the banking regulator to tackle possible problems in
the industry, the International Monetary Fund said.  The registrar of banks,  Errol Kruger , can’t appoint a
curator at a lender and there are “severe limitations on his
authority to cancel or suspend a bank’s license,” the
Washington-based lender said in a report on its website today.
“These constraints limit the registrar’s ability to act
decisively in case of emerging problems at a bank.”  The IMF gave a positive assessment of South Africa’s
financial system, saying it had weathered the global financial
crisis better than most countries, with no banks requiring a
bailout. Regulation of the industry is “sound” and effective,
which helped to reduce the impact of the crisis, the fund said.  “It is the strength of our regulatory system that ensured
that the South African financial sector responded to the 2008
financial crisis as well as it did, unlike the major
systemically important banks operating in the advanced economies
of the world,” the  National Treasury  said in an e-mailed
statement.  South Africa’s banking industry is dominated by four
lenders:  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , FirstRand Ltd.’s First
National Bank, Barclays Plc’s  Absa Group Ltd.  and  Nedbank Group
Ltd.   To contact the reporters on this story:
