Canada’s currency came within less
than one cent of parity with the greenback and also rose against
most major peers on speculation that extended U.S. tax cuts will
boost the North American economy.  The currency gained for the first time in four days against
its U.S. counterpart and advanced versus the euro, yen and
Australian and New Zealand dollars. Government bonds fell,
pushing the 10-year yield to a five-month high. The Bank of
Canada yesterday left interest rates unchanged at 1 percent amid
falling exports and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “The Canadian dollar is faring better than most currencies
due to our strong commodity basis and our relatively decent
economic performance, compared to the rest of the globe,”  John Curran , a senior vice president at the online currency dealer
CanadianForex Ltd., said by phone from Toronto.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, strengthened as much as 0.6
percent to C$1.0063 per  U.S. dollar  before trading at C$1.0109
at 4:43 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0124 yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.92 U.S. cents.  The loonie advanced 0.1 percent to C$1.3414 against the
euro and rose 0.8 percent to 83.09 yen. It appreciated 0.5
percent to 99.02 cents per Australian dollar and strengthened
1.4 percent to 75.56 cents per New Zealand dollar. The two South
Pacific nations, like Canada, are commodities exporters.  U.S. Tax Cuts  The U.S. currency gained versus half of its major peers as
Treasury yields rose, making it more attractive, after President
 Barack Obama  agreed on Dec. 6 to extend tax reductions for two
years. In return, Obama would get lengthened unemployment
benefits for the long-term jobless and a $120 billion cut in the
payroll tax for one year.  The proposed payroll tax reduction may result in Americans
spending $108 billion more than forecast, according to a note to
clients from  Joseph LaVorgna ,  Carl Riccadonna  and  Brett Ryan ,
economists at Deutsche Bank AG.  The Reuters-Jefferies  CRB Index  of raw materials rose 0.4
percent after earlier falling 0.9 percent. The loonie has
rallied 4.2 percent this year, partly on demand for the nation’s
commodities, including gold, crude oil, copper, timber and
wheat, which account for about half of its export revenue.  Canada’s dollar will weaken to C$1.02 by the end of 2011,
according to the median forecast of 29 economists and analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Housing starts  rose in November to 187,200, from a revised
167,800 in October, Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported
today. That beat the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of 21 economists, which called for a rise to 173,000.  Canadian Bonds  Government bonds dropped, sending the benchmark 10-year
yield up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.25
percent. It touched 3.32 percent, the highest level since June
22. The price of the 3.5 percent security due June 2020 fell 25
cents to C$102.03.  Canadian government bonds have lost investors 1.1 percent
this month, paring the gain for the year to 5 percent, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data show.  Canada sold C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion) of three-year debt
today, drawing an average yield of 2.091 percent. The government
received bids of C$7.8 billion for the 2 percent securities
maturing in March 2014, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website.  Russian Reserves  The share of Canadian dollars in Russia’s international
reserves may rise to between 1 percent and 2 percent,
approaching the level of the Japanese yen, central bank Chairman
 Sergey Ignatiev  said today.  Ignatiev, who last month indicated Russia had begun buying
assets denominated in Canadian dollars, said the central bank
doesn’t plan to add additional currencies after it expands the
stockpile to include Australian dollars. There probably won’t be
any “serious changes” in the structure of the world’s third-
biggest reserves in 2011, he told reporters in Moscow.  Europe, where a sovereign-debt crisis prompted bailouts of
Greece and Ireland this year, remains in a “troubling”
situation, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.  The effects of the global financial turmoil “are far from
over,” IMF Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said today
in Geneva, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. “The
situation in Europe remains troubling and the future is more
uncertain than ever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
