China  National Offshore Oil Corp.,
the nation’s largest offshore oil developer, got state approval
to buy a 50 percent stake in  Exoma Energy Ltd. (EXE) ’s exploration
blocks in  Australia  for A$50 million ($50.5 million).  The parent of  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  will gain access to Exoma’s five
coal-seam gas blocks in Queensland, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a  statement  on its website today.  China National signed an agreement for the Australian gas
blocks in December, joining companies such as BG Group Plc and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc in exploring for coal-bed methane to meet
rising demand for energy from the Asia-Pacific region including
China. Domestic rival PetroChina Co. and Shell acquired
Australian coal-seam gas producer Arrow Energy Ltd. last year
for A$3.5 billion.  Listed unit Cnooc also received approval from the Chinese
government to buy 33.3 percent of  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) ’s
Niobrara shale gas project in Colorado and Wyoming, according to
 another statement  on the NDRC website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
