South African retail sales rose for a
10th straight month in October, as a series of interest-rate
cuts supported a rebound in consumer spending.  Sales  growth accelerated to an annual 6.1 percent from a
revised 6 percent in September, Pretoria-based  Statistics South
Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of eight
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.2 percent. Sales rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in the month.  “It’s a positive number” that reflects improved consumer
confidence and lower interest rates, said  Carmen Altenkirch , an
economist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg. “Hopefully we
will see retail sales ticking up over the next two months.”  The Reserve Bank has cut its benchmark interest  rate  nine
times to 5.5 percent since December 2008 to help spur spending,
as a rally in the rand helped contain inflation.  The rand traded at 6.9565 per dollar at 12:13 p.m. in
Johannesburg from 6.9735 before the release of the sales data
and 6.8938 late yesterday.  On Nov. 23, Edcon Holdings Ltd., a South African retailer
owned by Bain Capital LLC, said sales rose 14 percent to 5
billion rand in the quarter to Oct. 3.  Massmart Holdings Ltd. ,
the country’s biggest food and general goods wholesaler, on Nov.
24 said sales for the first 21 weeks of its 2011 fiscal year
rose 14 percent, as it opened more stores and consumer spending
rebounded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
