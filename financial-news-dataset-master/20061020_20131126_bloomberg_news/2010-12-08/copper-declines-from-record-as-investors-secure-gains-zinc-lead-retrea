Copper dropped from Shanghai to New
York and declined from a record in London as some investors sold
the metal to lock-in gains following its climb to an all-time
high, amid speculation China will tighten monetary policy.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 2 percent to $8,705.50 a metric ton and
traded at $8,770.75 a ton by 4:04 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract advanced for a sixth day yesterday, the longest rally
since July, reaching a record $9,044 a ton. Zinc, lead and
nickel also dropped today.  The metal used in construction and automobiles has gained
18 percent this year, rallying on prospects that the U.S. will
take further steps to boost its economy, including extending tax
cuts and increasing asset purchases.  “The market needs to consolidate the big gains made in the
past few days but the uptrend remains intact,” Lin Yi, a deputy
manager at Zhongda Futures Co., said from Zhejiang. “The
conditions are in place for further new highs.”  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost as much as 2 percent to 65,510 yuan ($9,827) a
ton, before ending the day at 65,520 yuan. Futures on the Comex
in New York dropped as much as 1.8 percent to $3.97805 a pound,
after climbing to a 31-month high of $4.1315 yesterday.  The dollar’s rebound also weighed on prices today, Lin
said. The greenback rose for a third day against a six currency
basket including the euro and yen after President  Barack Obama 
agreed to extend tax cuts for two years.  China Rates  “The biggest risk to the market now is the prospect of an
interest rate hike in China,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at
China International Futures (Shanghai) Co.  The government’s statistics bureau brought forward the
release of November economic data on inflation, retail sales,
industrial output and fixed-asset investments by two days to
Dec. 11, heightening speculation the People’s Bank of China will
raise interest rates this weekend.  Expectations that the central bank will raise borrowing
costs again have grown after the ruling Communist Party
announced on Dec. 3 the country will shift to a “prudent”
monetary policy next year from a “moderately loose” stance as
the government seeks to combat accelerating inflation.  Aluminum in London fell 1.3 percent to $2,274 a ton, zinc
dropped 3.3 percent to $2,230 a ton, and lead decreased 2.5
percent to $2,341.25 a ton. Nickel shed 1.6 percent to $23,700 a
ton, and tin declined 0.8 percent to $25,000 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
