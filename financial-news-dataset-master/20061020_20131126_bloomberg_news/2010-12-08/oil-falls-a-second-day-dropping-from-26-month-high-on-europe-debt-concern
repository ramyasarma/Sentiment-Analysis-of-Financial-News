Oil declined after breaking through
$90 a barrel yesterday as on concern Europe’s debt crisis will
hurt fuel consumption, and after an industry report showed U.S.
gasoline supplies surged the most since January.  Futures fell a second day as traders secured profits from a
rally to $90.76 a barrel, the highest in 26 months. The dollar
strengthened after European ministers ruled out immediate aid
for debt-ridden Portugal and Spain, dulling investor appetite
for commodities. The American Petroleum Institute said gasoline
stockpiles  increased  4.8 million barrels last week.  Crude for January delivery lost as much as $1.08, or 1.2
percent, to $87.61 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $88.37 at 1:32
p.m. London time. Brent crude for next-month settlement fell as
much as $1.12, or 1.2 percent, to $90.27 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “Oil is facing contradictory pressures,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London. “On
the one hand it’s being pumped up by Chinese demand and colder
weather, while on the other relatively high supplies and
economic anxieties are dragging it down.”  Yesterday, futures in New York snapped a four-day advance
after rising to the highest since Oct. 8, 2008. Oil has risen 11
percent this year, heading for a second annual increase. The
market soared 78 percent in 2009, the most since prices more
than doubled in 1999.  OPEC Production  Oil’s rally is unlikely to coax OPEC into raising
production quotas at a meeting this week in Ecuador, as group
members consider the global economic recovery strong enough to
withstand price gains, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for about 40 percent of global supply, will maintain
limits set in 2008 when representatives gather in Quito on Dec.
11, according to all but one of 39 analysts and traders
surveyed. Oil ministers from Angola, Venezuela and Libya say the
group will probably stand by its target to pump  24.845 million 
barrels a day.  Crude slipped today amid speculation that China, the
world’s largest energy user, will raise interest rates this week
to tame inflation.  Asian stocks  fell by the most in two weeks
after China’s statistics bureau brought forward the release date
of economic indicators by two days to Dec. 11, heightening
expectations that the People’s Bank of China will act.  Futures later pared losses as December futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index advanced 1.6 to 1,224.80.  Sovereign Debt Contagion  European institutions must act more quickly to stem
contagion from the sovereign-debt crisis, International Monetary
Fund Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said in Athens
yesterday. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against
six major trading partners, gained 0.4 percent to 80.16.  “The market continues to worry over Europe’s ability to
prevent debt issues from spreading,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
in Melbourne, said in a note today. “Crude prices lost
momentum, potentially as cautious long investors took profits
due to uncertainty in the market.”  U.S. crude stockpiles decreased 7.34 million barrels to
349.3 million last week, the industry-funded API said yesterday.
An Energy Department report today will  probably show  supplies
dropped 1.4 million barrels, according to the median estimate
from 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Distillate fuel inventories, which include heating oil and
diesel, increased 1.7 million barrels to 159.3 million, the API
said. The Energy Department’s report, due at 10:30 a.m. in
Washington, is expected to show stockpiles  declined  900,000
barrels, based on the survey. Gasoline inventories probably
 slipped  300,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
