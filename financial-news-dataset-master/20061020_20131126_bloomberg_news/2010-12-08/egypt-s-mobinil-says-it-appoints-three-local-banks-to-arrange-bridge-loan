Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services  said
it appointed three local banks to arrange a 1 billion-Egyptian
pound ($173 million) “bridge loan,” to finance the company’s
network expansion.  The lenders are Commercial International Bank, National
Societe Generale Bank and the National Bank of Egypt, the Cairo-
based company, which operates under the brand Mobinil, said in a
regulatory filing. The loan will be paid off using a 2 billion-
pound medium-term loan from the same banks, it said.  The North African country’s biggest mobile-phone network
operator needs the funds to expand 3G coverage and upgrade its
network, as well as that of its Internet service provider
LinkdotNet, Chief Executive officer  Hassan Kabbani  said in an
interview on Oct. 24.  Mobinil shares advanced 0.2 percent to 168 pounds at 1 p.m.
in Cairo, valuing the company at 16.8 billion pounds.  Khalid Ellaicy , Mobinil’s vice president for finance, did
not respond to voice and text messages to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
