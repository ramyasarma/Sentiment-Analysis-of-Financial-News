Sugar gained for the first time in
three days on concern that global supplies may lag behind
demand.  Russia lost 1.3 million metric tons of output after the
worst drought in at least five decades damaged crops, Interfax
reported, citing First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov.
Pakistan may import as much as 600,000 tons next year to ease
shortages and control prices, a growers group said.  “The fundamentals are bullish,” said Mario Silveira, an
analyst at FCStone Group Inc. in Campinas, Brazil. “The market
has been volatile because of global financial developments.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.57 cent, or 2
percent, to settle at 28.98 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price declined 3.7 percent in the
previous two days.  The commodity has more than doubled since touching a 13-
month low of 13 cents in May. Adverse weather in China and
Brazil, the world’s largest grower, also threatened production.  It’s “too early” for India, the second-biggest producer,
to estimate output or formulate a proposal for exports, said
Sharad Pawar, the country’s farm minister.  “The market is still waiting for a clearer picture on
exports from India,” said  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst at F.O.
Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. “As long as there is no
announcement, volatility in sugar can be expected to persist.”  India was the biggest importer last year after a weak
monsoon reduced production.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery were
little changed at $732.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
