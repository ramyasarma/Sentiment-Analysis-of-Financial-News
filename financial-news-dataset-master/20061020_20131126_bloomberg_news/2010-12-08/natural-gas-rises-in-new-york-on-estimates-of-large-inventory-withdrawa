Natural gas futures rose to the
highest price in more than three months in New York on
speculation that warm weather and declining production may widen
a stockpile deficit.  Gas advanced 2.8 percent after the Energy Department
reported that output in the lower 48 states slid 1.9 percent in
February. The department said yesterday that gas inventories for
the week ended April 22 totaled 1.685 trillion cubic feet, 0.6
percent below the five-year average.  “We had an inventory level that was supposed to be
impenetrable,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFGBest in
 Chicago . “We’ve had a few bullish stockpile reports, and people
are wondering if there’s an issue with production.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 12.7 cents to settle at
$4.698 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The settlement price was the highest since
Jan. 21. The futures climbed 6.5 percent this week, the third
consecutive gain, and were up 7 percent for April.  Inventories were below the five-year average for the first
time since the week ended Feb. 25. Stockpiles were 11 percent
below levels a year earlier, the widest year-on-year deficit
since Aug. 8, 2008, yesterday’s report showed.  Gas output in the lower 48 states fell to 65.49 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 66.78 billion, the government
said today in its EIA-914 report. Much of the decline was caused
by cold weather in  Texas ,  New Mexico ,  Oklahoma  and  Wyoming , the
department said.  Large Drop  “This was the biggest drop in over a year,” said Pax Saunders, an analyst with Gelber & Associates in Houston, in a
note to clients today.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. rose by
four to 882 last week, the first increase in four weeks,
according to data published today by Baker Hughes Inc.  Hot weather in the southern U.S. may boost air conditioning
use, sparking demand for natural gas in  power plants . Above-
normal temperatures are likely in the region from May 9 through
May 13, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville,
 Maryland .  The high temperature in El Paso, Texas, on May 12 may be 88
degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 3 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  Power plants use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Nuclear Production  U.S. nuclear-power output rose from its lowest level in
more than 10 years as  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) 
boosted the Salem 1 reactor in New Jersey, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said. Nuclear power plant shutdowns can
boost demand for gas as a replacement fuel.  Power generation nationwide increased 994 megawatts, or 1.4
percent, from yesterday to 71,277 megawatts, or 70 percent of
capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-nine of the nation’s 104 reactors were
offline.  “We attribute the bullish storage surprises primarily to
nuclear power facility outages, which have led to a higher than
expected call on gas-fired power generation,” analysts
including  Cameron Horwitz  at Canaccord Genuity in Houston said
in a note to clients today.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
275,927 as of 2:54 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 319,000. Volume was 412,862 yesterday. Open interest was
960,981 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
926,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
