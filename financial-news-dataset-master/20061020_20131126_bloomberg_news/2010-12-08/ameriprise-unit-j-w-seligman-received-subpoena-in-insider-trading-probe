Ameriprise Financial Inc ., the
Minneapolis-based money manager and insurer, said its J&W
Seligman & Co. unit received a subpoena seeking information
related to a federal probe of alleged insider trading.  “Like many other firms, a couple weeks ago, Seligman
received a general information request that is not specific to
individuals or securities,”  Ben Pratt , a spokesman for
Ameriprise, said in an e-mailed statement. Authorities told the
company it isn’t a target of the investigation, he said.  Hedge funds SAC Capital Advisors LP, Diamondback Capital
Management LLC and Level Global Investors LP and mutual fund
company  Janus Capital Group Inc . said last month they had
received subpoenas, and mutual fund manager Wellington
Management LP said it had also been asked for information. The
firms have said they’ve been informed they aren’t targets of the
investigation. No firm has been accused of wrongdoing.  Ameriprise bought Seligman for $440 million in 2008, adding
$18 billion in assets, including $3.2 billion in hedge funds.
Ameriprise managed about $444 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.  Pratt wasn’t able to immediately identity which regulatory
or law enforcement agency issued the information request.  Ameriprise rose 67 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $55.35 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has gained
43 percent this year, compared with the 9.8 percent increase for
the Standard & Poor’s  index  of asset managers and custody banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
