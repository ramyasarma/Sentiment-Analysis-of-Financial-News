Qantas Airways Ltd. ’s grounding of
its Airbus SAS A380 fleet after an engine explosion may cost
A$207 million ($204 million), analysts at Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit said.  The estimate includes A$137 million for lost revenue at
Australia’s largest airline and A$70 million for direct repair
costs for the  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  Trent 900 engines that power
its A380s, Merrill Lynch analysts led by  Kevin O’Connor  said in
a Dec. 7 report to clients.  Qantas began legal action against London-based Rolls-Royce
last week, seeking unspecified compensation for the grounding
prompted when a Trent 900 exploded shortly after takeoff from
Singapore on Nov. 4. The Sydney-based carrier has returned two
of its six A380s to the air for flights to London while Los
Angeles services for the jets are halted pending further tests.  “We expect compensation to fully cover direct costs and
revenue loss,” O’Connor wrote, affirming his “buy”  rating  on
Qantas shares. “But this doesn’t cover the cost of rebuilding
Qantas’ brand.”  Qantas  fell 1.9 percent to A$2.64 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
Sydney trading. The stock has dropped 8 percent since Nov. 3,
compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the S&P/ASX 200 index.  Olivia Wirth , a Qantas spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the Merrill Lynch estimate. Roger Hunt of Sydney-based Hunt
McDonald & Associates, which handles Rolls-Royce’s media
communications in Australia, said the engine maker continues to
work with customers on resolving issues with the Trent 900,
declining to comment further.  Qantas said Dec. 2 it has begun talks with Rolls-Royce to
recoup financial losses and may sue if a settlement can’t be
reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
