Corn rose from a one-week low after a
government report showed that ethanol demand surged to a record,
reducing U.S. inventories of the grain used to make the fuel.  Ethanol  production  jumped 6.1 percent last week to a record
939,000 barrels a day, the biggest weekly gain since the end of
July, as  stockpiles  sank 4.2 percent, the steepest decline since
Aug. 20, the Energy Department said. Production of gasoline
blended with  ethanol  soared 9.8 percent to 4.97 million barrels
a day, the agency said.  “The record ethanol production and increased consumption
were a big surprise and boosted corn buying,” said  Jim Riley , a
broker for the Linn Group in Chicago. “The grind for corn
appears to be stronger than people expected,” reducing supplies
available for export and for U.S. livestock producers, he said.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 12.75 cents, or 2.3
percent, to close at $5.745 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after falling to a one-week low of $5.5225.  On Nov. 9, corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said adverse weather had reduced
the size of the domestic crop. The department also projected
U.S. inventories before next year’s harvest would fall to the
lowest since 1996.  For the year ending Aug. 31, implied annual demand for corn
to produce ethanol rose to 5.1 billion bushels last week, above
the 4.8 billion the USDA forecast in November, said  Jerrod Kitt ,
a market analyst for the Linn Group in Chicago.  “It’s a huge gain in production growth,” Kitt said. “The
drop in inventories suggests better demand.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
