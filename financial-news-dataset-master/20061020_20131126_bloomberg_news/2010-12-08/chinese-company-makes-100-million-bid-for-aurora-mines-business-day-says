An unidentified Chinese state-owned
mining company making a $100 million bid for South African gold
mines owned by Aurora Empowerment Systems Ltd. will meet
liquidators of the assets today, Business Day said.  The liquidators are meeting a delegation from the Chinese
company to agree on guarantees for the purchase of a 65 percent
stake in the two Aurora mines, Business Day said, citing Enver
Motala, one of the liquidators.   The Chinese company will take operational control of the
mines being run by Aurora, which is owned by President Jacob
Zuma’s nephew, Khulubuse Zuma, and former President Nelson
Mandela’s grandson, Zondwa Mandela, it said.         To contact the editor responsible for this story:
