Japanese  stocks  gained, boosting the
Topix’s market value to its highest level in more than five
months, after the yen weakened, raising expectations exporters’
earnings will improve.  Sony Corp. , an electronics maker that earns about 40
percent of its revenue from the U.S. and Europe, rose 1.9
percent. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent
of its sales abroad, gained 2 percent. East Japan Railway Co.,
the nation’s largest train operator by sales, jumped 2.8 percent
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. iterated its “buy” rating.
Mitsui & Co., a trading house whose biggest profit source is
commodities, rose 1.3 percent after metal prices increased.  “A weaker yen is positive for exporters, so investor
pessimism is receding,” said  Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee
about $2.2 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “If
the yen were to strengthen, that would drag down earnings for
carmakers and other exporters.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.9 percent to 10,232.33
at the close in Tokyo. The Topix advanced 0.9 percent to 887.39,
with more than four times as many shares gaining as falling. The
total value of shares on the Topix rose to more than 300
trillion yen ($3.58 trillion) for the first time since June 22.  The  Topix  has tumbled 11 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about U.S. economic growth damped confidence
in a global recovery. Stocks in the index trade at 15.4 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Dollar Advances  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent yesterday,
after surging 1 percent earlier. U.S. stocks pared gains in the
final hour of trading, pulling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
down from a two-year high, after a probe of insider trading
reportedly widened and President Barack Obama said he’ll push to
overhaul the tax code in two years.  The dollar climbed against most of its major counterparts
as Treasury yields surged on speculation an agreement to extend
tax cuts will boost the economy, increasing demand for U.S.
assets. The greenback rallied against the euro and the yen after Obama  broke a stalemate on extending middle-class tax cuts
introduced by the administration of  George W. Bush .  “The global economy is on track for mild recovery in terms
of fundamentals,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are likely to
buy stocks, led by those of export-related industries, on the
reversal of the yen’s appreciation.”  Exporters Gain  Sony  rose 1.9 percent to 3,040 yen. Kyocera Corp., an
electronic-equipment maker that earns a third of its revenue
from the U.S. and Europe, gained 1.4 percent to 8,690 yen,
contributing the most to the Nikkei 225’s gain.  Electronics makers were the biggest support to the Topix’s
advance among its  33 industry groups , followed by carmakers.  Honda gained 2 percent to 3,135 yen, the heaviest
contributor to the gain of the Topix among its 1,664 companies.
Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru brand vehicles,
rose 1.6 percent to 630 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.94 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 82.51 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened
to 111.11 from 110.11. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Railways Advance  East Japan Railway  rallied 2.8 percent to 5,220 yen and
Central Japan Railway Co., the country’s biggest high-speed
train operator, advanced 1.2 percent to 664,000 yen.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. maintained its “buy” rating on
the railway companies, saying “we think recent declines have
left the stocks undervalued” in a report dated today.  Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest trading house, increased 1.3
percent to 1,379 yen and its smaller rival Sumitomo Corp. rose
1.2 percent to 1,188 yen.  The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
copper and aluminum gained 1.1 percent yesterday, rising for a
second day. Copper climbed to a 31-month high in New York and
reached a record in London on speculation that an extension of
U.S. tax cuts will help bolster the economy, increasing demand
for the industrial metal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
