Mozambique’s economy expanded 7.4
percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a
year earlier, the country’s statistics agency said.  Growth in the southern African country slowed from 8.8
percent in the previous three months, the Maputo-based National
Institute of Statistics said in a  statement  on its website
today. Gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.8
percent from the previous quarter, the agency said.  Mozambique’s economic growth may exceed 7 percent this
year, the International Monetary Fund said on Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
