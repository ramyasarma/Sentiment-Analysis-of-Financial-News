China’s passenger car sales jumped to
a record in November, climbing 27 percent from a year ago, China
Daily reported, citing the China Passenger Car Association.  Sales exceeded 1.28 million cars last month, up 10.5% from
October, the Beijing-based newspaper said today, citing the
association. Sales will continue to gain in December,  Rao Da ,
secretary general of the association said, according to the
newspaper.  Government stimulus policies including tax rebates and
vehicle trade-in subsidies have spurred car sales in China. The
country overtook the U.S. to become the world’s biggest market
for new automobiles last year.  The  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers , the
official trade body for the auto industry, is scheduled to
release November vehicle sales data tomorrow.  -- Tian Ying ,  Tan Hwee Ann . Editor:  Chua Kong Ho ,  Lena Lee .  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
