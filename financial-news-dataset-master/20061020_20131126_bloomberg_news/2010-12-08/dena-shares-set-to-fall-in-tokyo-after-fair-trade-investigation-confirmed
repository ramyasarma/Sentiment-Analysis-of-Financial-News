DeNA Co. shares were set to pare
gains in Tokyo after the social network website operator
confirmed the company is under investigation by the nation’s
Fair Trade Commission.  The shares were untraded with sell offers outnumbering bids
by about 6 to 1 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of 12:32 p.m.
local time. They had gained 1.2 percent to 2,732 yen before a
Nikkei newspaper report of the investigation.  The Japanese operator of the Mobage-town gaming website may
have tried to bar game developers from providing content to
competitor Gree Inc., the Nikkei said.  A DeNA spokesman, Tetsuhiro Kaneko, confirmed the
commission is investigating the company.   To contact the reporter on this story:
