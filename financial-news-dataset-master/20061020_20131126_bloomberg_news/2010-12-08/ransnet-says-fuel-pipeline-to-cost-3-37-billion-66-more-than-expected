A fuel pipeline being built between
Johannesburg and Durban by state-owned logistics company
Transnet Ltd. will cost 23.4 billion rand ($3.37 billion), 52
percent more than estimated a year ago.  Costs for the 555-kilometer (344-mile) link, which will
connect South Africa’s biggest port to its industrial hub by the
end of 2013, rose for several reasons, including climbing steel
prices, and were compounded by changes to the route and design,
acting Chief Executive Officer  Chris Wells  said today. Costs
aren’t likely to rise further after a comprehensive review, he
told reporters in Johannesburg.  The Johannesburg-based company has applied for a 69 percent
tariff increase with South Africa’s energy regulator. The
company charges oil producers including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,
 BP Plc , Total SA, Sasol Ltd. and  Chevron Corp.  for use of its
current 45-year-old pipeline.  The new pipe is to have a 70-year lifespan and will pump
170 million liters of petrol, diesel and jet fuel a week by
2017, covering users’ requirements entirely and eliminating the
need for road transport, Wells said. The project will add 5
cents a liter to the price of fuel for consumers, he said.  Transnet has funds to pay for the pipeline, Wells said. The
company will sell $1 billion in bonds in international markets
when the conditions are right, Wells said. The initial issue,
which will help fund capital spending, was delayed because of
instability triggered by the Greek debt crisis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
