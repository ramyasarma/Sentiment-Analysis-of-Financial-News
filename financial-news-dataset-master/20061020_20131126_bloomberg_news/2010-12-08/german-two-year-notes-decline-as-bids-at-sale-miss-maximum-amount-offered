German two-year  notes  extended
declines, sending the yield nine basis points higher to 0.96
percent as of 10:31 a.m. in London, after investors bid for less
than the full amount of securities offered.  The German government sold 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion)
of debt due in December 2012 today, less than the maximum 5
billion euros on offer. It received bids for 4.58 billion euros.
The notes were sold at an average yield of 0.92 percent.  “This is the third auction in a row going technically
uncovered for Germany,”  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in London, wrote in an e-mailed
note. “At today’s auction the unattractive level of the front
end of the German curve coupled with the risk-on environment
over the last two days have likely played a role in the weak
result.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
