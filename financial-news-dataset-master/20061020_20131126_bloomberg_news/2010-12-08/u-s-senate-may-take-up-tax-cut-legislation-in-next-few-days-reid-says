Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said
he hopes to bring tax-cut legislation to the floor in the next
few days and that Democrats will seek changes to the agreement
between Republicans and President Barack Obama.  “I hope in the next day or two that we can be on that,”
said Reid after a meeting of Senate Democrats to discuss the
tax-cut plan. Asked whether the Senate would have the votes to
pass the measure, he said, “I hope so.”  He said Democrats would seek changes to the measure while
refusing to spell out what they would be.  Leading Democrats for months pushed Obama’s position that
Bush-era income-tax cuts should be extended beyond Dec. 31 only
on the first $200,000 earned by individuals and $250,000 by
couples filing jointly.  Obama, in the deal he announced Dec. 6, yielded to
Republican insistence on extending tax cuts for all income
levels in exchange for an additional 13 months of unemployment
insurance for the long-term jobless and cutting the payroll tax
by $120 billion for a year.  The plan also would create a top federal estate tax rate of
35 percent while exempting the first $5 million from each
individual’s estate. It would be the second-lowest estate tax in
80 years.  Vice President  Joe Biden  will meet with House Democrats
later today to discuss the agreement, a day after he came to the
Senate Democrats’ weekly luncheon to try to round up support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
