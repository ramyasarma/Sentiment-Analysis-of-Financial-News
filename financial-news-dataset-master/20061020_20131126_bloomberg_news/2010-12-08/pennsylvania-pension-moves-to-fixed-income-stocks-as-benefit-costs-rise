Trustees of the $24 billion
retirement system for state employees in  Pennsylvania , the sixth
most-populous U.S. state, approved plans to shift assets from
hedge funds to stocks and fixed-income securities.  The move will raise the share of the fund’s holdings to 39
percent stocks from 27 percent, and to 26 percent fixed income
from 15 percent, according to a news release from the State
Employees’ Retirement System. The transition will help cover
rising benefit payments and is a long-term target, the release
said.  Benefits and expenses are expected to cost $2.6 billion in
2011, rising to $4 billion in 2020, the news release says.  The plan adopted today “continues the planned gradual
shift, introduced last year (and subject to annual review),
toward a greater allocation to fixed-income investments in order
to meet the liquidity needs arising from a projected increase in
benefit payouts as the fund matures,” the release says.  The  fund , which has about 226,000 members, gained 5.2
percent, or $1.2 billion, during the quarter that ended Sept.
30, according to the news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
