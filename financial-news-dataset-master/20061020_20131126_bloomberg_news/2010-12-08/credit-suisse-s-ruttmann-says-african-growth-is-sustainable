Multinational companies are looking
to Africa to offset a slowdown in growth in developed markets,
driving an increased number of mergers and acquisitions on the
continent, according to Robert Ruttmann, an emerging markets
equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “We have seen M & A transactions in excess of $50 billion
that have been announced” this year, Ruttmann said in an
interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television’s
Countdown. “This is a trend that is likely to become a very
important part of the 21st century.”  Africa’s population reached 1 billion last year and after
economic growth averaging 4.9 percent from 2000 to 2008 the
number of families with an income of more than $20,000 a year
has exceeded India’s, according to a report published in June by
McKinsey & Co.  “You have a consumer market that is still in its infancy,
you have massive technological catch-up potential and you have
growing populations,” Ruttmann said.  “The fact that Africa has recovered so quickly from the
financial crisis in 2008 I think is testament to the fact, and
it’s also confounding a lot of skeptics, that this African
growth story is sustainable. We expect growth rates on an income
inflation-adjusted basis per-capita of 5 percent plus a year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
