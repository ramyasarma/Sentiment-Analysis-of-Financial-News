South Africa’s government named a new
board for Transnet Ltd., the state-owned rail, ports and
pipeline operator, and tasked it with appointing a chief
executive officer within three months.  Mafika Mkwanazi , a former Transnet CEO and current chairman
of Hulamin Ltd., Africa’s largest aluminum processor, will be
chairman of the board, which will assume office by Dec. 13,
Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba said. Other board
members include Juergen Schrempp, CEO of Katleho Capital GmbH,
 Peter Moyo , chairman of Vodacom Group Ltd., and Nazmeera Moola,
an economist at Macquarie First South Securities.  “The appointment of the board puts Transnet on a firmer
footing,” Mbalula told reporters in the capital, Pretoria,
today. The announcement “brings some stability to the
company.”  The new board and CEO will oversee a 93.4 billion-rand
($13.5 billion) expansion program over the next five years aimed
at ending transportation bottlenecks in Africa’s largest
 economy .  Transnet has been without a permanent CEO since  Maria Ramos 
left to join  Absa Group Ltd. , South Africa’s largest retail
bank, in March last year. On Nov. 1, Transnet said acting CEO
 Chris Wells  would resign from the position by March 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
