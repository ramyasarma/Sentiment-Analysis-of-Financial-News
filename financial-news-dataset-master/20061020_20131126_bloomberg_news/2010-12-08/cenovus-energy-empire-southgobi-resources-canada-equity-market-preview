     Dec. 9 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as railroads and metal producers gained after
the U.S. reported a bigger drop in initial jobless claims than
most economists forecast.  Goldcorp Inc., the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, gained 1.8 percent as the metal advanced after
Fitch Ratings cut Ireland’s credit rating three grades to BBB+.
Canadian National Railway Co., the country’s biggest railroad,
advanced 1.2 percent as U.S. first-time unemployment claims
declined 3.4 percent. Lululemon Athletica Inc. surged 15 percent
after beating analysts’ profit estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 14.94
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,166.94. The index has closed
higher than 13,000 every day this month after trading below that
level from September 2008 through early last month.  “We’re sort of establishing a new floor above 13,000,”
said  David Cockfield , who helps oversee C$300 million ($297
million) as a money manager at MacNicol & Associates Asset
Management Inc. in Toronto. “The double-dip has faded into the
background. People who were frightened to the sideline are
coming back into the market.”  The S&P/TSX fell 0.9 percent Dec. 7 and yesterday after a
seven-day streak of gains as precious metals dropped on
speculation that tax cuts will keep the U.S. economy from re-
entering recession. The Canadian benchmark rallied 12 percent
this year through yesterday, led by raw-materials producers, as
prices of metals and agricultural commodities have jumped.  U.S. Jobless Claims  First-time unemployment applications in the U.S. fell to
421,000 last week from 436,000 the week before, the Labor
Department said today in Washington. Economists had forecast a
drop to 425,000, according to the median of 50 estimates in a
 Bloomberg survey .  Also today, Japan said its  economy  grew at a 4.5 percent
annualized rate in the third quarter, up from a 3.9 percent
estimate reported last month.  Stocks extended their advances after Pacific Investment
Management Co., which manages the world’s largest bond fund,
boosted its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2011.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, rose 3.1 percent to C$108.50
after  Anindya Mohinta , an analyst at Citigroup Inc., raised his
rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold.” Inmet Mining
Corp., which produces copper, gold and zinc, climbed 5.2 percent
to C$74.91, the highest since May 2008.  Gold, Silver Rebound  Shares of precious-metal producers gained as gold and
silver rebounded from their biggest decreases in three weeks
yesterday.  Goldcorp advanced 1.8 percent to C$46.80. Barrick Gold
Corp., the world’s largest producer of the metal, increased 0.8
percent to C$53.91. Kinross Gold Corp., Canada’s  No. 3 producer ,
climbed 0.9 percent to C$18.61.  Canaco Resources Inc., which explores for gold in Africa,
surged 15 percent to C$6.05, extending its monthly gain to 41
percent. For the second time this week, the company announced
drilling results from Tanzania, this time saying the findings
“continue to indicate excellent continuity of grade and
structure.”  Canadian National gained 1.2 percent to C$67.32 as North
American  carriers  advanced with the U.S. economic data. Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd., the No. 2 railroad in Canada, increased
1.2 percent to C$65.25.  Calfrac Climbs  Oilfield-services company Calfrac Well Services Ltd.
climbed for a fifth day, rallying 4.6 percent to C$34. The
company raised its semi-annual  dividend  to 7.5 Canadian cents a
share from 5 Canadian cents a share, as of the dividend payable
next month.  Lululemon soared 15 percent to a record C$64.23 after
topping the average analyst estimate for third-quarter earnings
by 43 percent, excluding certain items. The company also
forecast fourth-quarter profit higher than all 16  analyst
estimates .  Propane distributor Superior Plus Corp. rose 2.4 percent to
C$10.84. The stock had fallen  nine straight days , the longest
streak since 2006, as the company announced a C$150 million
offering of debt that can be converted into stock.  To contact the reporters on this story;
