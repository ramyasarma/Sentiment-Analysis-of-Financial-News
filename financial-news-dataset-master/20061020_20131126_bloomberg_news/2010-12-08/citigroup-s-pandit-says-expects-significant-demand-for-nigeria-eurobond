Citigroup Inc.’s Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit said he expects to see “significant
demand” for Nigeria’s planned eurobond.  The bond will be received by a broad investor base and will
attract interest from developed and emerging markets, Pandit
told reporters today in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.
Citi may consider entering the Nigerian equity market to provide
liquidity and access to capital, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
