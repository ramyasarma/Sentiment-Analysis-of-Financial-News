Warren Buffett ’s Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. railroad shouldn’t be allowed to have its trains
inspected in Mexico instead of the U.S., labor unions said.  The railroad, part of Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc ., is
asking U.S. regulators for permission to move U.S.-Mexico border
inspections, saying facilities in Mexico are better and that
equipment reviews there match the quality on the U.S. side.  Moving the inspections to Mexico would cost U.S. jobs and
jeopardize safety, labor unions said in comments filed this week
with the Federal Railroad Administration. Divisions of the AFL-
CIO, the Transportation Communications International Union and
the Teamsters were among groups that commented.  “Once you allow as a matter of government policy to have
these trains inspected in Mexico, then it’s just a matter of
time when all the cross-border train business gets outsourced,”
 Edward Wytkind , president of the AFL-CIO’s transportation union,
said today in a telephone interview. “It’s not just a threat to
jobs. It’s a threat to the safety of the rail system.”  Burlington Northern, based in Fort Worth, Texas, wants to
use Ferrocarril Mexicano SA de CV, the rail unit of Grupo Mexico
SAB, to perform border inspections before trains cross into the
U.S., according to a July 5 filing with the rail administration,
which regulates railroad safety.  Spokesmen for Burlington Northern and the rail regulator
didn’t immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
