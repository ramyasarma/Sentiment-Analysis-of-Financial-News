Billionaire  Philip Falcone ’s new
satellite for his  LightSquared  wireless venture has a
malfunction that’s preventing its antenna reflector from opening
properly, according to builder Boeing Co.  The satellite, launched Nov. 14, is designed to supplement
coverage for the fourth-generation wireless network Falcone is
building to compete with  AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Wireless  in
selling mobile services. Falcone is the founder of the Harbinger
Capital Partners hedge fund.  “ Boeing , in close partnership with its LightSquared
customer, has assembled a team of experts to assess progress and
continue deployment of the antenna,” Chicago-based Boeing said
in an e-mailed statement. “As with any post-launch checkout,
it’s not unexpected for minor delays to occur.”  The glitch could imperil discussions between LightSquared
and other companies that may be seeking to buy capacity on the
network,  Jennifer Fritzsche , a Wells Fargo & Co. analyst in
Chicago, said in a research note today. She said LightSquared’s
authorization from the Federal Communications Commission is
contingent on having a working satellite.  Tom Surface , a spokesman for Reston, Virginia-based
LightSquared, said in an e-mail that the company expects its
network rollout “to proceed on schedule.”  The satellite difficulties were reported earlier by Space
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
