BOC Kenya Ltd., a supplier of
industrial and medical gasses and accessories, said earnings for
the 12 months through December will be lower than the same
period a year earlier.  “This is in line with restructuring and other measures
announced and implemented following this year’s half-year
results,” the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. It didn’t provide further details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
