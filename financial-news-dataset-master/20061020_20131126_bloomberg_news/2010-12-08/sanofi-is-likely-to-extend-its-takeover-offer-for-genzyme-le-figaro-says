Sanofi-Aventis SA is likely to extend
its bid for Genzyme Corp., which expires at midnight in New York
on Dec. 10, without raising the price, Le Figaro reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Bankers and lawyers acting for Sanofi are studying the
possibility of offering guaranteed value certificates which
could allow a further payment to Genzyme holders based on the
performance of the Campath drug, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
