Commodities fell the most in a week
on speculation China is getting closer to raising interest
rates, curbing demand for raw materials.  The S&P GSCI spot index of 24 commodities declined as much
as 1.1 percent, the most since Nov. 30, and was down 2.57
points, or 0.4 percent, at 604.57 by 10:49 a.m. in London.
Cotton slid 2.6 percent and zinc dropped 2.1 percent. The index
has gained 15 percent this year as economic growth spurred
demand in China, the world’s largest energy user and biggest
buyer of copper, cotton and soybeans.  China’s statistics bureau brought forward the release of
November economic data including inflation and retail sales to
Dec. 11, heightening speculation the central bank will raise
interest rates this weekend. The GSCI index fell 1.7 percent
after China announced higher rates on Oct. 21. Copper and gold
rose to records yesterday.  “Should interest rates actually be raised and measures to
dampen the economy be introduced, metal prices would most
probably remain under pressure for a while,” Commerzbank AG
said in an e-mailed report today. “Investors are clearly taking
profits after the latest high-altitude flight.”  Copper for delivery in three months slid as much as 2
percent on the London Metal Exchange, the first drop since Nov.
29, and was last down 0.4 percent at $8,845 a metric ton. It
reached $9,044 yesterday. Gold for immediate delivery, which
yesterday touched $1,431.25 an ounce, today fell 0.4 percent to
$1,396.18.  Chinese Lending  Loans in China may have topped the government’s forecast of
7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) by the end of November, which
“has led to expectations that China could implement further
measures to cool the local economy,” Commerzbank said.  “The biggest risk to the market now is the prospect of an
interest-rate hike in China,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at
China International Futures (Shanghai) Co.  Among agricultural commodities, wheat plunged 1.9 percent
to $7.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans
dropped 0.8 percent to $12.7575 a bushel and corn fell 0.7
percent to $5.58 a bushel. Lower closes today for soybeans and
corn would mark the third straight decline for both.  Rice tumbled 3.2 percent to $13.71 per 100 pounds in
Chicago and cocoa slid 1.1 percent to $3,049 a ton on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
