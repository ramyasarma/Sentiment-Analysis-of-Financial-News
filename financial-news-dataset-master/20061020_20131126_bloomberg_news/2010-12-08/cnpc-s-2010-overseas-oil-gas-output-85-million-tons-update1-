China National Petroleum Corp. , the
country’s biggest energy producer, said new discoveries
increased its overseas crude and gas output to about 85 million
metric tons this year.  Overseas crude production rose 16 percent a year on average
between 2006 and 2010, while overseas natural gas output gained
21 percent annually, CNPC, the parent of Hong Kong-listed
PetroChina Co., said in its on-line newsletter today.  PetroChina  has pledged to step up acquisitions and expand
cooperation with global oil companies to help meet rising
domestic demand. CNPC’s overseas crude output was 70 million
tons last year while gas production reached 8.2 billion cubic
meters, the state-controlled company said in January.  Oil processing at CNPC refineries outside China reached
10.1 million tons, unchanged from 2009, the Beijing-based
company said today. Overseas crude refining volume climbed 2.6
percent a year on average between 2006 and 2010, CNPC said.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
