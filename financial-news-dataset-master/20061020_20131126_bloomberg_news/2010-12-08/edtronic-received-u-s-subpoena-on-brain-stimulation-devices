Medtronic Inc ., the largest maker of
heart devices, said it received a subpoena from the U.S.
Attorney in western New York related to sales, marketing and
reimbursement practices for its brain stimulation products.  Medtronic received the U.S. inquiry on Oct. 14 and is
cooperating with the investigation, the Minneapolis-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  The Medtronic neuromodulation division reported  sales  of
$1.6 billion last year. The unit makes stopwatch-size
 implantable devices  that are used to reduce chronic pain,
stimulate movement for such diseases as Parkinson’s and treat
psychiatric disorders.  “We have no comment beyond what we state in the filing,”
Medtronic spokesman  Brian Henry  said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
