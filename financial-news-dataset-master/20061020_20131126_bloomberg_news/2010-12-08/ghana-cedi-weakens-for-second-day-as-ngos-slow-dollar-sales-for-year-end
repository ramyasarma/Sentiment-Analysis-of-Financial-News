Ghana’s currency, the cedi, weakened
for a second day as non-governmental organizations slowed down
their operations for the end of the year.  The currency traded at 1.4590 versus the dollar as of 11:42
p.m. in  Accra , or 0.1 percent weaker than 1.4575 when the market
opened this morning, he said.  The agencies, which receive funding in dollars or euros and
sell the foreign currency for cedis to finance local operations
“are all shutting down for the year,” said Kevin Adarkwa, an
Accra-based currency trader at Standard Chartered Plc’s  Ghana
unit .  Demand for the currency may revive as the holiday season
approaches as Ghanaians overseas send remittances to family and
friends in the West African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
