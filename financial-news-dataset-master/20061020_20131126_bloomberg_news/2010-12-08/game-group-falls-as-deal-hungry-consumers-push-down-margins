Game Group Plc , a U.K. electronic
games retailer, declined the most in 10 weeks in London trading
after it said sales fell and margins may narrow as consumers
seek more Christmas bargains.  The company  declined  as much as 7.3 percent, the biggest
drop since Sept. 28, after saying margins will likely narrow by
between 1.6 and 1.9 percentage points this year, dampening
profit, compared with a year earlier. Sales fell 7.8 percent in
the 18-weeks to Dec. 4, and the Basingstoke, England-based
retailer maintained its cautious outlook in a statement today.  “Candidly, there is no doubt that what we’ve signaled
today is steeper margin erosion than we necessarily indicated,”
 Ian Shepherd , chief executive officer of Game Group, said on a
conference call. “Certainly in the run up to Christmas
consumers appear to be more deal-hungry.”  Shepherd said analysts had estimated full-year profit of
about 37 million pounds ($58 million). After today’s
announcement, “you’ll see some of the analysts coming out at
the lower end of the current range and that’s probably a
sensible thing to do when you play through the numbers,” he
said.  Same store sales declined 4.6 percent in the 18-week
period, an improvement from a 7.9 percent drop in the 44 weeks
to Dec. 4, Shepherd said. Comparable sales fell about 3 percent
in the last 10 weeks as the retailer benefited from new
products, including Microsoft Corp.’s motion-sensing peripheral
Kinect for Xbox 360, he said.  Game Group said today it expects continuing weakness in
hardware and gamer-product markets. The company expects 7
million pounds of cost savings this year.  Game Group was trading 6.6 percent lower to 67.5 pence at
10:10 a.m. local time today, giving the company a market value
of 234.4 million pounds ($369 million.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
