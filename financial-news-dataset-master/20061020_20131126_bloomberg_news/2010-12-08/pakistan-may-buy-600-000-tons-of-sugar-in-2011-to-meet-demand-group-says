Pakistan, Asia’s third-largest sugar
user, may import as much as 600,000 metric tons of sugar in the
next calendar year to ease shortages and control prices, said
the Sindh Abadgar Board, a grower’s group.  “Production is expected to remain at 3.3 million tons this
year, against an annual demand of 4.2 million tons,” said
Zulfiqar Yousfani, vice president of the board. An additional
600,000 tons may be needed to keep prices stable after 300,000
tons was imported recently, he said in an interview.  The government on Sept. 16 said the country would face a
shortage of 1.2 million tons after floods caused $7 billion in
damage, including $3.27 billion in terms of crop losses. On
Sept. 21, Paksitan abolished a 25 percent duty on raw sugar to
facilitate imports, after purchasing 1.2 million tons for the
calendar year 2010.  Iskandar Khan, a former chairman of the Pakistan Sugar
Mills Association, said orders for as much as 600,000 tons
should be placed in August next year so that they can be
delivered in October or November.  Domestic retail prices fell to 72 rupees a kilogram ($0.84
cents) on Dec. 1, after reaching a record 120 rupees two months
ago, said Abbas Zia, a trader at Jodia Bazaar in Karachi, which
is the country’s biggest wholesale commodities market.  “Prices fell after mills started crushing sugarcane, and
this increases competition between them,” Zia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
