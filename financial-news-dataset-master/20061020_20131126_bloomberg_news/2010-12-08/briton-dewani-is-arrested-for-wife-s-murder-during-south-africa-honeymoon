Shrien Dewani, whose wife was
murdered while the U.K. couple was on a honeymoon in South
Africa last month, was arrested yesterday after surrendering to
police in Bristol, England.  The 30-year-old is accused by South African authorities of
conspiring “with others to murder Anni Dewani” in Cape Town,
the Metropolitan Police Service said in an e-mailed statement.  Anni, 28, was killed Nov. 13 after the taxi she and her
husband were traveling in was carjacked in the township of
Gugulethu, near Cape Town. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was hired by
Shrien to arrange the murder, the Western Cape Director of
Public Prosecutions Rodney de Kock told the Cape High Court
yesterday, the South African Press Association reported.  Max Clifford , a publicist hired by Shrien Dewani, said
yesterday the allegations were “ludicrous” and “totally
untrue.”  Tongo, who was sentenced to 18 years in jail for his role
in the murder, said in a plea bargain with the state that Shrien
Dewani offered him 15,000 rand ($2,160) to orchestrate a hit on
his wife, according to the news agency. Tongo, 31, found two
other men, who have also been arrested in connection with the
murder, to carry out the killing, Sapa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
