Pete Sampras , whose 14 major
championships are second in tennis history to  Roger Federer ’s 16, was robbed of most of the trophies he won
throughout his playing career, the Los Angeles Times said.  Sampras, 39, told the newspaper that while he still has 13
of his Grand Slam trophies, he lost “everything else” when
dozens of boxes were stolen from a public storage facility in
west Los Angeles.  Sampras and his family recently moved and rented two
storage units, the Times said. Among the items stolen were
trophies for winning 64  ATP Tour  events and reaching the finals
of 24 others; awards from his five season-ending ATP World Tour
titles, 11 ATP Masters event titles and two Davis Cup wins; an
Olympic ring; and six trophies for finishing No. 1 in tennis’s
annual ranking, according to the report.  “Losing this stuff is like having the history of my tennis
life taken away,” Sampras said, adding that none of the
trophies or memorabilia was insured because there was no way to
assess its value.  Sampras’s first Australian Open trophy was also stolen,
along with items including magazine articles and newspaper
clippings, the Times said. Sampras told the newspaper that
police have no leads in their investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
