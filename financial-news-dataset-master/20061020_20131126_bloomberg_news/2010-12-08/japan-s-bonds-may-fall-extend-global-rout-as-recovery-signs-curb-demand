Japan’s  bonds  rose and erased earlier
losses on signs consumer prices are unlikely to climb any time
soon, increasing the value of the fixed payments of debt.  Ten-year yields fell from a six-month high after government
data showed a gauge of prices across the nation’s economy
declined more than estimated. Bonds also slumped after Bank of
Japan board member  Yoshihisa Morimoto  said upside and downside
risks for the economy are “generally balanced.”  “I expect deflation to persist for a substantially long
time,” said  Takeshi Minami , chief economist at Norinchukin
Research Institute Co. in Tokyo. “Japan’s bond market is
bottoming out.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell three basis
points to 1.2 percent as of 2:04 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.2 percent security due December 2020 added 0.267 yen to 99.999.
The yield earlier climbed 3.5 basis points to 1.265 percent, the
highest level since June 4.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery rose 0.49 to
140.59 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan’s gross-domestic-product deflator, a gauge of price
trends, fell 2.4 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, compared with the 2 percent drop initially reported,
the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
