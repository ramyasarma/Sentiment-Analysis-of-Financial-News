KKR Financial Holdings LLC  call-
options volume jumped to triple the four-week average, even as
the shares declined, after a single wager that the publicly
traded debt vehicle of KKR & Co. will rally by April.  More than 8,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 2.6
times the number of puts to sell, as of 4 p.m. in New York. The
 biggest trade  was a spread strategy in which an investor bought
1,500 April $9 calls and sold the same number of April $10
calls,  Caitlin Duffy , an equity options analyst at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote in a
report. The shares fell 5.1 percent, the most since July, to $9.  “Today’s spread trader seems to be looking for a move
beyond $10 through the April expiration,”  Frederic Ruffy ,
senior options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a New York-based
provider of options-market analysis, wrote in a note.  The investor is betting on a rebound in the specialty-
finance company as it fell today after saying it plans to sell
18 million of its common shares in an underwritten public
offering. The San Francisco-based company hasn’t closed above
$10 since August 2008.  Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that  volatility , or stock swings, will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
