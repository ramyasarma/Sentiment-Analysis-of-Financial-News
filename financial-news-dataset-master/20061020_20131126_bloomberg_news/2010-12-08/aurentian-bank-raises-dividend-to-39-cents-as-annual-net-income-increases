Laurentian Bank of Canada  raised its
dividend for the second time in 12 months after annual profit
rose on higher mortgage and commercial loans.  Laurentian, the last Canadian bank to report results,
increased its quarterly payout 8.3 percent to 39 cents a share.
The Montreal-based bank said fourth-quarter profit declined 14
percent because of a year-earlier gain.  Laurentian is the third Canadian bank to increase dividends
this quarter as lenders end a year-long freeze in payout gains.
National Bank of Canada and Canadian Western Bank also boosted
their dividends, while Canada’s five biggest banks kept their
payouts unchanged.  Net income at Laurentian for the period ended Oct. 31
declined to C$32.5 million ($32.2 million), or C$1.24 a share,
from C$38.2 million, or C$1.47, a year earlier, according to a
statement today.  Profit topped the C$1.18-a-share average  estimate  of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canada’s seventh-biggest bank rose 85 cents, or 1.9
percent, to C$46.25 in 9:37 a.m. trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
