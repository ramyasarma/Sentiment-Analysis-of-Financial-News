Duke University freshman guard Kyrie
Irving is out indefinitely after injuring a toe in a Dec. 4 win
over Butler.  Irving, who has been selected as the Atlantic Coast
Conference’s Rookie of the Week three times this season while
averaging 17.4 points per game for the top-ranked Blue Devils,
will rest and undergo rehabilitation for the injury on his right
foot, coach  Mike Krzyzewski  announced on the school’s  website .  “Our medical staff will continue to monitor the recovery
process and he will return to action once it has sufficiently
healed,” Krzyzewski said in a statement. “Kyrie is an
outstanding player and we are confident that he will bounce back
from this setback.”  Irving is second in scoring for the Blue Devils (8-0)
behind Nolan Smith (17.8 points per game) and has scored in
double figures in each of Duke’s eight games. He had 31 points,
six rebounds and four assists in an 84-79 win Dec. 1 against
sixth-ranked Michigan State, and added 21 points in the victory
against Butler, which was a rematch of last season’s national
championship game.  Duke is the unanimous No. 1 team in both the Associated
Press Top 25 and ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
