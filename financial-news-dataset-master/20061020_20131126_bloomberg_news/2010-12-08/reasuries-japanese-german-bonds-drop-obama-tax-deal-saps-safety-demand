Treasuries dropped, pushing  yields  of
benchmark 10-year notes to the highest level in six months, as
optimism the global economic recovery is gathering pace sapped
demand for safety.  Yields  on German bunds rose above 3 percent for the first
time since May, and Japanese five-year yields gained the most in
more than two years. U.S. debt remained lower as the government
sold $21 billion of 10-year notes two days after President
 Barack Obama  agreed to extend his predecessor’s tax cuts. Yields
on corporate and municipal debt surged.  “The carnage hasn’t stopped,” said  George Goncalves , head
of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 18
primary dealers obligated to participate in government auctions.
“The market got greedy” ahead of the Federal Reserve’s plan to
buy Treasuries “and is paying for it as investors have been
selling underwater longs for the last three weeks.” A long is a
bet an asset will rise in value.  The 10-year Treasury note  yield  advanced 14 basis points,
or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.27 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 fell 1 1/8, or $11.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 94 18/32.  The yield touched 3.33 percent, the  highest level  since
June 4. It had earlier increased 36 basis points over two days,
the most since Sept. 19, 2008, when Treasuries fluctuated
following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Two-
year note yields climbed as much as 10 basis points today to
0.64 percent, the highest level since July 28.  Yield Curve  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt increased to as much as 2.70 percentage points
today, the widest spread since May 18.  At today’s 10-year note auction, the securities drew a
yield of 3.340 percent, compared with the average forecast of
3.307 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 7 primary dealers.
The sale was a reopening of the Nov. 9 auction, which produced a
yield of 2.636 percent.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 44.4 percent of the notes,
compared with 56.6 percent in November, the most since the
Treasury began releasing the data in 2003. The average for the
past 10 sales is 43.4 percent.  “Often in sell-offs like this, international buyers will
step in and bail the market out, but it isn’t clear that they
are willing to do that,” said  Steve Rodosky , the head of
Treasury and derivatives trading at Newport Beach, California-
based Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
largest bond fund. “That has some in the market concerned.”  Bid-to-Cover  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.92. The
average at the last 10 auctions was 3.12.  Yesterday’s $32 billion auction of three-year debt drew the
lowest demand since February. The U.S. will sell $13 billion of
30-year securities tomorrow, completing this week’s $66 billion
of note and bond sales.  Bonds fell for a second day after Obama agreed on Dec. 6 to
the two-year extension of current tax rates in exchange for
another 13 months of federal unemployment insurance for the
long-term jobless and cutting the payroll tax by $120 billion
for one year. The president said he would accept a lower rate
for the estate tax than Democrats wanted in order to break a
stalemate over extending  George W. Bush ’s tax cuts.  “It’s no doubt that this is more relief than most expected
in the market, particularly with the payroll taxes,” said  Russ Certo , a managing director and co-head of rates trading at
Gleacher & Co. in New York. “A concept that is worth noting is
higher rates could threaten the housing recovery. I don’t think
it’s anyone’s intention to have higher rates cut off the
benefits we are getting from the tax situation.”  Corporate Bonds  U.S. corporate bonds lost 0.76 percent yesterday, the most
since May 7, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. The debt has declined 0.92 percent this month, paring this
year’s gain to 10.87 percent. Company bond yields jumped 0.12
percentage point yesterday to 4.95 percent, the biggest increase
since February 2009.  Signs that the global economic recovery is gathering pace
helped to push down Build America Bond prices. The average yield
on the taxable securities climbed yesterday to 6.35 percent, the
most since Jan. 7, according to a Wells Fargo & Co. index.  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, gained seven basis points to 3.01 percent,
after reaching 3.03 percent, the highest since May 4.  Japan’s five-year note  yield  jumped 10 basis points to
0.524 percent in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The increase in yields was the
biggest since June 11, 2008, Bloomberg data showed.  Break-Even Rate  The  difference  between yields on U.S. 10-year  notes  and
those on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
securities known as the break-even rate, increased today to as
much as 2.29 percentage points, the widest since May 13.  The White House budget office projects the federal deficit
this year will exceed $1.5 trillion, or 10.6 percent of gross
domestic product, and will remain as high as $751 billion, or
3.9 percent of GDP, in five years.  “We believe the market’s getting back to fundamental
values on the Treasuries,” said  Andrew Harding , who helps
manage $22 billion as chief investment officer for fixed income
at PNC Capital Advisors LLC in Cleveland. “There’s plenty of
Treasuries out there. And Treasuries at the end of the day
aren’t collectibles. With that kind of a deficit, it will be
very hard for the Fed to create scarcity value.”  The Fed bought $1.63 billion of inflation-protected
securities today maturing from July 2012 to February 2040 as
part of the asset-purchase program known as quantitative easing,
aimed at lowering borrowing costs and stimulating the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
