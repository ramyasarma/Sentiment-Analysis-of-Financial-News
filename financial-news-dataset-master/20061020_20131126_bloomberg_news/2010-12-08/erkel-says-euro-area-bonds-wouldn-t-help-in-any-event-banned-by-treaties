German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
reiterated her opposition to proposals for joint euro-area
bonds, saying the debate over steps to resolve the debt crisis
should be conducted “quietly and in a goal-oriented fashion.”  Issuing joint bonds, as proposed this week by Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , would in the first instance
fail to “provide the right impulse economically,” Merkel told
reporters in Berlin today. “Secondly, in our assessment it’s
not at all compatible with current treaties” that govern the
European Union.  Merkel, speaking at a joint press briefing with Sweden’s
Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt , also repeated that it is
important to “involve investors” in any future sovereign debt
crisis after 2013. Reinfeldt backed her, saying that treaty
changes are needed to include investor participation.  Merkel, under fire from Greece, Ireland and Spain over her
insistence that investors accept losses in any recurrence of the
turmoil sweeping Europe, is meeting with fellow EU leaders this
week to build support ahead of a Dec. 16-17 summit in Brussels
that will decide the matter. She is due to hold a joint Cabinet
meeting with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  Dec. 10.  “It’s about gathering all our strength to secure a good
result for the euro next Friday,” Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
