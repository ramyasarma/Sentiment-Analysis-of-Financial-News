U.S. ethanol  production  jumped 6.1
percent last week to a record 939,000 barrels a day, according
to the Energy Department.  Output gained the most since July 30.  Stockpiles  of the
gasoline additive sank 4.2 percent to 16.4 million barrels, the
steepest decline since Aug. 20 and the lowest level since Nov.
5, the department said today in Washington.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
soared 9.8 percent to 4.97 million barrels a day, the biggest
increase since June 5, 2009. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax
credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.3 cent to
$2.065 a gallon at 9:37 a.m. local time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has dropped 12 percent in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
