Rio Tinto Group  will take over
management of the Mongolian Oyu Tolgoi project, the world’s
biggest untapped copper and gold deposit, after agreeing to 
invest as much as $3.7 billion in partner  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.   Rio agreed to lend Ivanhoe $1.8 billion and will exercise
share warrants, participate in Ivanhoe’s planned $1.2 billion
rights offer and buy outstanding shares, the London-based said
in a statement. The deal will allow Rio to raise its stake in
Ivanhoe to 49 percent from 35 percent, the Vancouver-based mine
operator said separately.  The two companies, embroiled in a dispute since Ivanhoe
adopted a shareholder rights plan in April, yesterday said they
would suspend their arbitration proceedings for six months. Rio
and Ivanhoe, founded by mining billionaire  Robert Friedland , are
jointly building the $6 billion Oyu Tolgoi mine.  Ivanhoe  yesterday fell C$4.29, or 15 percent, to C$25.28,
at 4 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading, the most since
October 2008. Rio declined 0.3 percent to A$87.29 at 10:09 a.m.
in Sydney. Ivanhoe owns a 66 percent stake in the mine, with the
remaining interest held by Mongolia.  The interim loan from Rio will fund development of the mine
through to production, Friedland said yesterday in a statement.
Both companies are seeking to complete talks on a long-term
project finance package of $3.6 billion to replace the interim
loan in the first half of 2011, Ivanhoe said.  In addition to buying new stock as part of Ivanhoe’s rights
offer and exercising warrants, Rio will buy 20 million shares at
current market prices from Citibank Inc. and Friedland.  Mongolian Negotiations  Ivanhoe , which spent more than six years negotiating an
accord with Mongolia for Oyu Tolgoi, said in January it hired
Citigroup to study financing options including debt and equity
offerings and asset sales. The company said on Oct. 18 it
planned a rights offer, which Rio said it might seek to block.  Oyu Tolgoi holds estimated resources of 37 million metric
tons of copper and 1,300 tons of gold, allowing the mine to
operate for almost 60 years, Rio said. Mongolian President
Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj said last year the project may operate for
30 years and generate $30 billion to $50 billion of revenue.
Output is scheduled to begin next year.  Oyu Tolgoi, which means “turquoise hill” in Mongolian,
lies about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Chinese border.
The mine will produce an average 1.2 billion pounds of copper
and 650,000 ounces of gold a year for the first decade,
according to Ivanhoe.  Rio  agreed to buy 9.95 percent of Ivanhoe for $303 million
in October 2006 and acquired the right to increase its stake by
converting a credit line and outstanding warrants into equity.
Before yesterday’s accord, Friedland owned 18.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
