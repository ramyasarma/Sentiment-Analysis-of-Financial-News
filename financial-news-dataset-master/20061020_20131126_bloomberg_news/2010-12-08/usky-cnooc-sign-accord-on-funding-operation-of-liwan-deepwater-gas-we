Husky Energy Inc. , the Canadian oil
company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , said it
signed an agreement with Cnooc Ltd. formalizing the funding and
operation of China’s first deepwater gas discovery.  Husky will operate the deepwater portion of Liwan 3-1 in
the South China Sea, including drilling and developing links to
a shallow-water platform, the Calgary-based company said in a
statement.  Cnooc  will operate the shallow-water platform,
pipelines to the shore and an onshore gas-processing plant.  The Toronto-listed company found natural gas at two fields
in the South China Sea including Liwan 3-1, which could be
China’s largest offshore deposit with more than 100 billion
cubic meters (3.5 trillion cubic feet) of gas, according to
government estimates in 2006. Cnooc and its partners may spend
about 200 billion yuan ($30 billion) through 2020 to develop
fuel reserves in the region, Cnooc said in 2008.  The development plan for Liwan may be submitted to Chinese
regulators in early 2011, and production is expected in late
2013, according to Husky. The company said in February it
expected to submit the plan early this year with approval to
come within 2010.  Husky holds a 49 percent stake in Liwan, while Cnooc holds
the rest. The field will produce 8 billion cubic meters a year
initially and 20 billion cubic meters a year in the second phase,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported in December 2009.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Alexander Kwiatkowski .  To contact the reporter on this story:
