Kenya’s shilling weakened for a
second day against the dollar as the U.S. currency gained
against the euro on prospects an extension of tax cuts will
bolster an economic recovery.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.9 percent to 81.24 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent lower at 80.55 as of 14:12 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.
The shilling closed at 80.50 yesterday.  “The dollar is strengthening against the major currencies,”
Solomon Alubala, a trader at  Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. ,
said in a phone interview today. The shilling is trading in a
“limited range,” he said. “I foresee more activity in the coming
week as companies close before Christmas.”  The dollar rose after U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to
extend Bush-era tax cuts for two years. The currency traded at
$1.3205 per euro as of 12:48 p.m. in London from $1.3261, after
reaching $1.3442 per euro on Dec. 6, the lowest since Nov. 23.  The shilling weakened against the euro after the  Central
Bank of Kenya  said it bought 5 million euros today at 106.63
shillings each. The Kenyan currency traded at 106.62 shillings
per euro in Nairobi, compared with 106.42 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
