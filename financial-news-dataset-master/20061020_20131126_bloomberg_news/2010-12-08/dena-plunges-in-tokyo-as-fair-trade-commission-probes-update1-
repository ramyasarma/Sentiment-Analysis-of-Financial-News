DeNA Co. , Japan’s biggest developer
of social games for mobile phones, fell the most in two months
in Tokyo trading after the company confirmed it’s under
antitrust investigation.  DeNA  fell 6 percent to 2,538 yen at the 3 p.m. close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest decline since Oct. 13. The
stock earlier dropped as much as 11 percent.  DeNA  has gained 38
percent this year compared with a 3 percent decline in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  A DeNA spokesman, Tetsuhiro Kaneko, confirmed Japan’s Fair
Trade Commission is investigating the company. Kaneko declined
to comment on a Kyodo News report that said DeNA may have told
game developers it would stop doing business with them if they
provided content to competitor  Gree Inc.  Developers who didn’t
comply may have been excluded from search results on DeNA’s
Mobage Town site, Kyodo reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Mobage Town is a social network site which contains titles
made in-house and by third-party developers. Games played on the
site are typically free, with the makers of the titles
generating revenue by selling virtual goods such as body armor
and machine guns in DeNA’s most popular game, “ Bandit Nation .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
