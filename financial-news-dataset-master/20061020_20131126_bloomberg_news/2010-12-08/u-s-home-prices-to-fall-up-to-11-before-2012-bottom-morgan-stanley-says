U.S. home prices will decline as much
as 11 percent as weak demand and rising inventory extend the
housing slump into 2012, according to Morgan Stanley.  Prices  will be as much as 36 percent below their 2006 peak
before finding a bottom, Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Oliver Chang  wrote in a report today. Sales will stay “depressed”
through next year amid tightened lending standards, they said.  “We see the trough occurring in 2012 instead of our
previous call of 2011,” Chang said in a telephone interview
from San Francisco. Values will be little changed for three to
four years after 2012, gaining or losing about 2 percent without
factoring in inflation, he said.  As many as 8 million homes are in default or foreclosure
and may be offered for sale, known as shadow inventory,
according to Morgan Stanley. The looming supply will combine
with tight credit and questions about housing-finance regulation
to reduce prices 6 percent to 11 percent from current levels,
the analysts said.  Housing demand has slumped since the start of the year as a
government tax credit expired and unemployment hovers near 10
percent. Sales of  existing homes  in October fell to an annual
pace of 4.43 million, compared with 5.98 million a year earlier
and an annual average of 5.81 million over the past decade, the
National Association of Realtors reported Nov. 23. The median
price was $170,500, down from $172,000 a year earlier.  Douglas Yearley , the chief executive of  Toll Brothers Inc. ,
said in an interview yesterday that the worst is over for the
housing market. Yearley said 2012 will be a “big year” for his
company, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, after the market
changes little next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
