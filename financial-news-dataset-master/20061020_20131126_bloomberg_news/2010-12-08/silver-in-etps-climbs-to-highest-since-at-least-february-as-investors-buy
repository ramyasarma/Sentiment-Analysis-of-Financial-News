least February on concern government plans to pump money into
the global economy to support a recovery may devalue currencies.  Holdings jumped 136.168 metric tons to 15,009.54 tons
yesterday, exceeding the 15,000-ton mark for the first time,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Silver for immediate delivery
rose as much as 1.4 percent to $29.0650 an ounce after rallying
yesterday to a 30-year high of $30.7025 an ounce. The price
traded at $28.5225 an ounce at 12:03 p.m. in Seoul.  “Silver has an aspect as a means for a store of value,”
Park Jong Beom, a trader at Tong Yang Futures Trading Co. in
Seoul, said by phone today. “But actually it’s closer to a
commodity used in industries.”  Silver has gained 69 percent this year, outperforming
gold’s 27 percent gain. One ounce of gold bought as little as
46.5988 ounces of silver yesterday, the least in four years,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The dollar  held gains from a three-week low against the yen

recovery in the U.S. President Barack Obama yesterday agreed to
extend Bush-era tax cuts for two years. A report tomorrow is
