Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” in the Central business district for a fourth
consecutive day, the city’s Environmental Protection Department
said on its website.  The pollution index read 149 in Central and 114 in Causeway
Bay roadside monitoring stations as of 6 a.m., the department
said.  Roadside readings above 100 are classified as “very high”
and trigger a government warning that people with heart or
respiratory ailments should avoid prolonged stays in heavy
traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
