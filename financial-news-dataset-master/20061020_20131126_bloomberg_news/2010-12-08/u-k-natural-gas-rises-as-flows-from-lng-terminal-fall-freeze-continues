U.K. natural-gas contracts advanced
after deliveries from liquefied gas terminals dropped while
freezing temperatures boosted heating demand.  Gas flows  declined from the Isle of Grain near London, BG
Group Plc’s Dragon LNG terminal and the South Hook facility in
Wales, National Grid Plc data show.  Gas for January delivery gained as much as 2 pence, or 3.4
percent, to 61.45 pence a therm. It was at 60.5 pence as of 4:30
p.m. in London. That’s equal to $9.55 a million British thermal
units. A therm is 100,000 Btus. The contract reached a 22-month
high of 62 pence a therm on Dec. 6.  “For the remainder of December and into the start of the
New Year, temperatures look set to remain very cold, well below
average for much of the U.K., with often widespread frost and
the risk of ice,” the Met Office said on its  website .  Gas for the first quarter of next year gained 0.65 pence,
or 1.1 percent, to 59.75 pence a therm. Gas for immediate
delivery gained 1.1 pence at 63.9 pence a therm.  London temperatures may drop to minus 9 degrees Celsius (16
Fahrenheit) by Dec. 20 from today’s low of minus 4, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Colder weather increases
demand for gas-fired heating and may allow storage inventories
to be replenished.  Stockpiles at  Rough , the country’s largest gas-storage
facility, fell to 27,470 gigawatt-hours as of 6 a.m. today, 27
percent less than at the same time last year, grid data show.  National Grid forecast  demand  will be 447 million cubic
meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, 93 million more than normal for the
time of year. The U.K.’s highest recorded daily gas demand was
465 million cubic meters in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
