Talisman Energy Inc. , the Canadian
explorer aiming to spend about $200 million in Papua New Guinea
this year, said it is interested in supplying gas to Exxon Mobil
Corp.’s $15 billion project in the Pacific nation.  Talisman may feed a potential third or fourth production
unit at the Exxon-led liquefied natural gas venture, among other
options, Ian Angell, Talisman’s business development manager,
said in Sydney today. The company aims to tap as much as 5
trillion cubic feet of gas resources, he said.  Exxon , Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
ConocoPhillips are among companies in Australia and Papua New
Guinea advancing with LNG projects to meet Asian demand for the
fuel. Exxon partner  Oil Search Ltd.  has said it is seeking
reserves to support two more processing units, or trains.  “You might think Talisman is all about shale” development
in North America, Angell said at a conference today. “Southeast
Asia potentially offers the greatest upside.”  The Calgary-based company also is “actively pursuing and
have invested significant money already in understanding the
potential for a longer-term gas offtake project,” possibly an
LNG development or a gas-to-liquids development, he said.  Talisman in 2009 acquired U.K. explorer Rift Oil Plc for
about 108 million pounds, adding gas assets in Papua New Guinea.  Horizon Oil Ltd. said in November that Papua New Guinea
refused to extend a license covering gas fields in the nation.
The permit is held by a venture including Horizon, Adelaide-
based oil and gas producer Santos Ltd. and Talisman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
