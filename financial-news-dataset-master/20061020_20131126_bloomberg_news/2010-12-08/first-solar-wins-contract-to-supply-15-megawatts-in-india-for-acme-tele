First Solar Inc. , the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar modules, said it won a contract to
supply 15 megawatts of panels to India’s  ACME Tele Power Ltd.   First Solar shares  jumped  as much as 2.6 percent after the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said today in an e-mailed statement
that it will ship the panels to ACME for a project in Gujarat by
March. The value of the contract was not disclosed.  First Solar rose $2.52, or 1.9 percent, to close at $133.50
in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. That trimmed the
stock’s decline this year to 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
