Swings in foreign-exchange rates will
surge next year as economic growth rates diverge, central
bankers seek to sustain recoveries and European leaders battle a
sovereign debt crisis, according to UBS AG.  Annual exchange-rate price swings may double on some major
currencies, predicted strategists at UBS, the world’s second-
biggest currency trader. The euro may range from $1.1 and $1.5,
compared with $1.1877 to $1.4579 so far this year; and U.S.
dollar may touch as low as 70 yen and high as 100 yen in 2011,
two times its 80.22 to 94.99 year-to-date range, the firm said.  “The divergence between the strength in emerging markets
and the unusual levels of uncertainty in the world’s major
economies will cause this super volatility,”  Mansoor Mohi- uddin,  the Singapore-based head of global currency strategy at
UBS, said in a telephone interview. “There is also high risk of
policy-maker error in relation to interest rates, quantitative
easing and fiscal tightening.”  UBS, the biggest currency trader after Deutsche Bank AG,
said companies should increase hedges against greater swings in
exchange rates. Corporations from the U.S., Japan and Europe
increased the percentage of projected income protected against
swings in exchange rates to a record, the most recent quarterly
survey of clients by JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Oct. 1 showed.  Standard Chartered Plc, the most accurate foreign-exchange
strategists, said weakness in the euro will extend into next
year as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis saps economic growth.  Fed Speculation  Standard Chartered, the top overall forecaster in the six
quarters ended Sept. 30 based on data compiled by Bloomberg,
predicted the euro may weaken to less than $1.20 by mid-2011
from about $1.3252 today.  Just a month ago, the euro reached $1.4282, the strongest
level since January, as traders sold the dollar on speculation
the Federal Reserve would debase the greenback by printing more
cash to purchase $600 billion of Treasuries in so-called
quantitative easing. The Fed began those purchases last month.  Implied volatility on options for major exchange rates
averaged 12.34 percent this year, compared with an average of
10.6 percent since January 2000, according JPMorgan Chase & Co.
data. The bank’s index of three-month options touched its 2010
high of 16.95 percent in May and was at 12.49 today.  “Overall investors will have to be more aware of foreign
exchange risk in 2011,” said Mohi-uddin. “For at least several
more years, volatility will be structurally higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
