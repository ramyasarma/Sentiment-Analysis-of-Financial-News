Serena Williams  may not make her
comeback on the women’s tennis tour until spring, she told the
 New York Post .  “I hope to be out of the cast and back on court by
spring,” the former world No. 1 told the paper at a fashion
party in Miami.  Williams, 29, last month withdrew from defending her title
at the Australian Open in January following a second surgery on
her injured foot in October.  Williams, who’s won five of her 13 Grand Slam singles
titles at Melbourne Park, hasn’t played competitively since she
retained her Wimbledon title in July. She said she cut her foot
on a shard of glass in Germany following that victory and had
surgery later that month.  Williams finished the year ranked fourth, as  Caroline Wozniacki  of Denmark took over the top spot from the American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
