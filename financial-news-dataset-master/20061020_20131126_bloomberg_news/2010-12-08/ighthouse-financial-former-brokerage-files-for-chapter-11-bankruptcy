Lighthouse Financial Group LLC, a
former securities brokerage, filed for bankruptcy protection
with $14.6 million in debt.  The Chapter 11 petition filed in Manhattan court today
listed $4.1 million in assets, and estimated the New York City-
based broker has up to 199 creditors. A separate petition for
holding company Lighthouse Global Partners was also filed,
listing up to $10 million in debt and under $1 million in
assets.  Robert Bradley, a managing member of the holding company,
said in court papers that the brokerage hasn’t had any business
aside from liquidating its positions since Aug.3, when it was
notified by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that it
was out of compliance with minimum net capital rules.  “In this chapter 11 case, the Debtor intends to wind-down
its remaining business, and liquidate any and all assets for the
benefit of its creditors,” lawyers for Bradley wrote.  The case is In re Lighthouse Financial Group LLC; 10-16506,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
