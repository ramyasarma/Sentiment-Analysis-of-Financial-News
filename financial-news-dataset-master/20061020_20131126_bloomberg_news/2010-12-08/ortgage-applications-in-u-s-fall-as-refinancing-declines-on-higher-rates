The number of mortgage applications
in the U.S. fell last week as higher lending rates led to a
fourth straight decline in  refinancing .  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  decreased 0.9
percent in the week ended Dec. 3, figures from the Washington-
based group showed today. Refinancing fell 1.4 percent, while
 purchases  climbed 1.8 percent, the third straight increase.  The  average rate  on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to the
highest level since July as the economy showed signs of
improving heading into 2011. Home-purchase applications rose for
the sixth week in the last seven, indicating the housing market
may be stabilizing even as  foreclosures  mount and unemployment
hovers near a 26-year high.  “The housing market continues to bounce along this fragile
bottom,”  Neil Dutta , an economist at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Global Research, said before the report. The purchase
index is down 13 percent from the same time last year.  The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.66
percent, the highest since the week ended July 23, from 4.56
percent. Borrowing costs have been rising since reaching 4.21
percent during the week ended Oct. 8, the lowest in records
going back to 1990.  At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be about $516.24, or $14 less than a
year ago when the rate was 4.89 percent.  Adjustable Rates  The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage rose to 3.98
percent from 3.91 percent, and the rate on a one-year adjustable
mortgage increased to 7.07 percent from 6.81 percent.  Borrowing costs may continue to increase. Yields on Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities that guide home-loan
rates jumped to their highest level in almost six months
yesterday after President Barack Obama agreed to extend tax cuts
for two years, as well as reduce payroll taxes and extend
emergency unemployment benefits.  Higher rates may be prompting some buyers to sign
contracts.  Toll Brothers Inc.,  the largest U.S. luxury-home
builder, saw deposits increase 10 percent in the final two weeks
of November compared with a year earlier as mortgage rates began
to climb, Chairman  Robert Toll  said Dec. 2.  “In the last two weeks, interest rates have been going
up,” Toll said yesterday during the company’s earnings call.
“So finally there is no longer a reason to sit and wait.”  Toll expects to sell between 2,100 and 2,900 homes in
fiscal 2011, compared with 2,642 units in the recently ended
year.  Americans still aren’t optimistic. Almost six in 10 U.S.
adults say a housing recovery is at least two years away,
according to a survey by Trulia Inc. and RealtyTrac Inc.
released Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
