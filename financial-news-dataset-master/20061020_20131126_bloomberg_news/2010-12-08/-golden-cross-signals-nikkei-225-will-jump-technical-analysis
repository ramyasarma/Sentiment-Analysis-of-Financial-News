Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
formed a so-called golden cross, indicating the gauge may climb
11 percent back to this year’s April high within the next
quarter, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  Nikkei’s 25-day moving average surpassed the 200-day moving
average today to form a golden cross, which is considered by
chart watchers to be a bullish signal. The event last occurred
in June 2009. The Nikkei’s high this year was on April 5, when
it closed at 11,339.30 and it may rise back to that level in
quarter ending March, said  Shoichiro Yamauchi , a technical
analyst at Nomura.  “A cross would signal the gauge is headed for its April-
high as a short-term target,” said Nomura’s Yamauchi. “The
200-day moving average has been moving sideways, and for the
shorter measure to move up and cross over, it indicates a
stronger bullish trend than if the cross-over was caused by a
decline in the longer measure.”  The last golden cross was formed on June 4 last year, when
the 200-day moving average crossed below the 25-day measure as
it continued a decline that started in 2007. The  Nikkei  then
surged 17 percent to its 2010 April high. It has since tumbled
9.6 percent as the 25-moving average fell through the longer
measure on May 31.  The Nikkei has jumped 16 percent from this year’s low on
Aug. 31. Bull markets are traditionally defined as gains of more
20 percent or more.  To contact the reporters on this story:
