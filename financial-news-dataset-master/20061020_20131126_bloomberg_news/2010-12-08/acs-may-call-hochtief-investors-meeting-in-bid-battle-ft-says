Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA may call an extraordinary shareholders meeting of
 Hochtief AG  in pursuit of its hostile bid to take over the
German construction company, the Financial Times reported,
citing two unidentified people close to ACS.  The Spanish company would try to use the meeting to break
down Hochtief’s remaining defences against its all-share offer,
which is designed to raise its stake above 30 percent, the
newspaper said.  An adviser to ACS said an attempt may be made to block
registration of a 10 percent capital increase announced by
Hochtief, which would see Qatar Holding LLC become the German
company’s second-biggest shareholder and dilute ACS’s stake to
27.25 percent, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
