Ricky Ponting  dropped out of the top
20 in the International Cricket Council’s Test batting rankings
for the first time since 2001 after Australia’s loss to England
in the second Ashes Test.  The Australian captain slipped 12 places to  25th  after
scoring 0 and 9 in his team’s defeat by an innings and 71 runs
in Adelaide, the ICC said. He’s scored 70 runs in four innings
so far in the series, 51 of those in the second innings in the
drawn first Test in Brisbane.  There are no Australian batsmen in the top 10. Left-armer
 Mitchell Johnson , who was dropped after the series-opening
match, is the only Australian in the top 10-ranked bowlers.  England spinner  Graeme Swann ’s haul of 5-91 in Australia’s
second innings moved him to within 14 ratings points of South
Africa’s Dale Steyn atop the Test bowling rankings. “A good
performance in the Perth and Melbourne Tests” could see him end
2010 in the No. 1 spot, the ICC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
