Gold and silver futures tumbled the
most in three weeks as the dollar climbed, eroding the appeal of
precious metals as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose for the third straight day against a
basket of six major currencies on speculation that an extension
of tax cuts will spur the U.S. economy. Gold has gained 26
percent this year, reaching a record $1,432.50 an ounce
yesterday.  “Gold is dominated by short-term traders at the moment,”
said  Frank Lesh  at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “Big
players have taken a profit after record highs, and the dollar
has stabilized, so short-term traders will sell gold and
commodities.”  Gold futures for February delivery dropped $25.80, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $1,383.20 at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Nov.
16.  Silver futures for March delivery tumbled $1.525, or 5.1
percent, to $28.252 an ounce, the biggest decline since Nov. 12.
Yesterday, the price reached $30.75, the highest since March
1980. The metal has jumped 68 percent this year.  Record silver-coin sales and investment in exchange-traded
products backed by the metal may signal a peak in the rally,
said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago.  ‘Big Players’ May Sell  “Once you suck in all the little people, that’s when the
big players will take the opportunity to sell,” Zeman said.  Silver holdings in ETPs jumped 136.17 tons to 15,009.54
tons, data from four providers show. That marked the biggest
gain in almost a month and the highest amount since at least
February.  Gold assets  in ETPs rose 2.22 metric tons to 2,101.37 tons
yesterday, the highest since Oct. 15, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record
2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  ETPs backed by silver represent a “new species of Hunt
Brothers” that could be a “potential threat” to trading, said
 Jon Nadler , a senior economist at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  The metal reached a record $50.35 on the Comex in 1980, a
year after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  Gold may fall because of China’s moves toward monetary
tightening,  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at  MF  Global Holdings Ltd.
in Chicago, said in a report.  Buying Opportunity?  The decline may be an opportunity to buy, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-
based Gartman Letter. He recommends investors purchase gold
priced in euros, U.K. pounds and yen to hedge against relative
dollar strength.  Palladium futures for March delivery declined $9.75, or 1.3
percent, to $728.95 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the third straight decline. On Dec. 3, the price
reached $780, the highest since April 2001. The metal has jumped
78 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped $23.80, or
1.4 percent, to $1,681.40 an ounce. The price has advanced 14
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
