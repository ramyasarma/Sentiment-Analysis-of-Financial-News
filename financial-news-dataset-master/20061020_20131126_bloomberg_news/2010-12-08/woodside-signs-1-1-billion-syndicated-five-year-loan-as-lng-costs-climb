Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s
second-largest oil producer, agreed to a $1.1 billion five-year
syndicated loan to refinance existing debt.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. arranged the loan, which was provided
by 34 banks, Perth-based Woodside said in a stock exchange
filing. It will use the funds to repay a loan of the same size
signed in May 2009, according to the filing.  Woodside said Nov. 30 that its Pluto liquefied natural gas
venture, one of more than a dozen proposed LNG developments in
Australia and Papua New Guinea, will cost A$900 million ($881
million) more and start about six months later than previously
projected. The company’s  credit rating  was cut to BBB+ from A-
by Standard & Poor’s on Dec. 3.  Woodside reduced its financing costs with the new loan, it
said today, without being more specific.  The oil producer was paying 225 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate on the loan signed in May last
year, while it was rated A-, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The margin increased to 250 basis points for a BBB+
rating, the data show.  Woodside  shares  rose 0.9 percent to A$43.11 as of 10:10
a.m. in Sydney, paring their decline this year to 8.8 percent.
