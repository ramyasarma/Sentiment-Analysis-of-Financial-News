Hong Kong’s main  stock  index fell the
most in two weeks after China advanced the release of economic
data, heightening concern the government will raise interest
rates this weekend as it fights to curb inflation.  PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest oil company, lost 2.7
percent as crude prices decreased. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,
the listed unit of the country’s biggest maker of the metal,
dropped 1.7 percent. China Citic Bank Corp., the banking unit of
the nation’s No. 1 investment company, slid 2.3 percent after
Citigroup Inc. recommended investors sell the shares.  “The market is in a consolidation phase,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-based research director at Cinda International
Holdings Ltd. “There’s going to be resistance for the market to
move higher. The expectation is that China may even raise
interest rates as soon as this week.”  The Hang Seng Index fell 1.4 percent to close at 23,092.52,
its sharpest drop since Nov. 23. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies retreated 1.4
percent to 12,735.86.  The Hang Seng Index has increased 5.6 percent this year on
expectations that growth in corporate earnings will overcome
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China’s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 14.5 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  PetroChina fell 2.7 percent to HK$9.83.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s
biggest offshore energy explorer, lost 2.4 percent to HK$17.92.
Aluminum Corp. dropped 1.7 percent to HK$7.14.  Crude oil futures decreased 0.9 percent to $87.91 as of
4:43 p.m. Hong Kong time in electronic trading in New York. The

data on Dec. 11 at 10 a.m. local time, two days earlier than
originally scheduled, according to a statement today.  The central bank may raise rates around the time set for
the release of November’s inflation data, the China Securities
Journal reported yesterday.  The bureau said Sept. 10 that its decision to bring forward
the release of August data to Saturday from Monday shouldn’t be
“over interpreted” after the move spurred speculation the
central bank was preparing to raise benchmark interest rates
that weekend. The People’s Bank of China moved a month later
with a 25 basis point increase in benchmark lending and deposit
rates, the first gain in two years.  Citic Bank  fell 2.3 percent to HK$5.20. Citigroup cut its
rating on the stock to “sell” from “hold.”  Sateri Holdings Ltd., a Chinese cellulose maker, fell 1.5
percent to HK$6.50 after gaining as much as 0.9 percent on its
trading debut.  CSR, Shangri-La  CSR Corp., China’s largest maker of rail vehicles, jumped
6.7 percent to HK$9.90 after the China Securities Journal
reported that the government may invest as much as 4 trillion
yuan ($601 billion) on the nation’s railways as part of its
five-year plan for the period ending 2015.  Trading in Shangri-La Asia Ltd. was suspended ahead of an
announcement on a proposed rights issue, according to a
statement. Shangri-La, a hotel operator, gained 1 percent to
HK$20.70 before trading was halted.  Almost eight stocks declined for each that climbed among
the Hang Seng Index’s 45 constituents. Futures of the gauge fell
