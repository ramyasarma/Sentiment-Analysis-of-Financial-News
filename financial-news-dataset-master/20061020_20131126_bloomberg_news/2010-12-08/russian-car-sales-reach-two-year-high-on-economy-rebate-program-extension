Russian new car sales rose 80 percent
in November, the most in two years, as the economy rebounded and
the government extended its rebate program for used vehicles.  Sales of automobiles and light trucks reached 189,902
vehicles last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 1,7
million, or 28 percent more than for the same period last year,
the  Association of European Businesses  said in a statement
today.  Sales may reach 1.9 million units this year, which is
“significantly beyond any previous forecasts,” David Thomas,
chairman of the AEB’s automobile-manufacturers committee, said
in an e-mailed statement.  The government is spending at least 21.5 billion rubles
($687 million) this year on cash incentives for automobile
purchases. Russia is following countries around the world that
extended incentive programs to reverse slumps in car sales
during the worst global slowdown since World War II.  “Clearly the scrappage scheme and improving credit
availability have combined with increased consumer confidence to
deliver growth across all segments and most brands,” Thomas
said.  Foreign carmakers including Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co.
and Toyota Motor Corp. are increasing output in Russia and
rolling out new models as the country’s economy expands.  The four best-selling models through November are all
Ladas, made by OAO AvtoVAZ, Russia’s largest automaker, followed
by Ford’s Focus and Renault SA’s Logan, which are made in
Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
