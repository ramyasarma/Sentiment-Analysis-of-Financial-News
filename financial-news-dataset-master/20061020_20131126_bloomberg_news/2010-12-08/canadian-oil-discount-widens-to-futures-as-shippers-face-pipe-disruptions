The discount for heavy Canadian crude
oil widened as  Enbridge Inc.  reported some shippers faced
temporary delivery interruptions.  “Some feeders have experienced temporary disruptions to
deliveries while space is created in receipt tanks by injections
into the mainline,” Gina Jordan, a spokeswoman for the Calgary,
Alberta-based company, said in an e-mail. “We expect to see
increasing improvement day by day as the month progresses and
expect to meet the apportioned nominations by month-end.”  Enbridge said Dec. 2 it could meet 74 percent of demand on
crude-oil pipelines 6A, 14 and 62 for December deliveries, after
earlier announcing restrictions on lines 6, 14 and 62. The
second restriction came after deliveries were slowed along the
670,000-barrel-a-day 6A line because of a power failure at a
pump station.  Western Canada Select ’s discount to WTI widened 75 cents to
$18.75 a barrel at 2:20 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The discount has widened 37 percent since
Dec. 1.  The discount for  Syncrude , a light, low-sulfur synthetic
oil derived from the tar sands in Alberta, was unchanged at
$2.65 a barrel. Canadian Oil Sands Trust is shipping less crude
oil than normal because tanks along Enbridge’s system are full,
Alison Trollope, a spokeswoman for the producer, said in a
telephone interview today.  Southern Green Canyon ’s discount narrowed 15 cents to $1.25
a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $2.50.
Poseidon’s discount to WTI widened 5 cents to $1.20 a barrel.  The premium for  Heavy Louisiana Sweet  widened 15 cents to
$4. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 10 cents to
$5 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
