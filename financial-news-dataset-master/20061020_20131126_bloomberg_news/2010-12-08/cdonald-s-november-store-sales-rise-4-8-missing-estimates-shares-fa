McDonald’s Corp.,  the world’s largest
restaurant chain, said comparable-store sales rose 4.8 percent
last month owing to strength in the U.S. and Europe.  Analysts projected sales would rise 5 percent. Sales
increased 4.9 percent in Europe, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based
company said today in a statement, helped by a drive to
modernize restaurants there.  Sales rose the same amount in the U.S., where  Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner  has been luring customers with the
McRib sandwich and new menu items.  Sales advanced 2.4 percent in Asia, Africa and the Middle
East, the worst performance since December, 2009.  Comparable, or same-store sales, include locations open at
least 13 months. This kind of revenue is a key indicator of
growth because new and closed locations are excluded.  McDonald’s  fell $1.60, or 2 percent, to $78.74 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has gained
26 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent increase for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
