Ethiopia will complete repairs on the
420 megawatt Gilgel Gibe II power plant this month and start
exports to neighboring Djibouti, an official at the state-owned
Ethiopian Electric Power Corp. said.  Transmission lines to Sudan are also “near to
completion,” Mekuria Lemma, head of strategic management at the
company, said in an interview yesterday in the capital, Addis
Ababa.  EEPCo said on July 12 that it would repair a collapsed
tunnel at Gilgel that month and begin exports in September.
Addis Ababa has suffered intermittent power cuts this year as
demand grows and EEPCo builds transmission lines from the new
300 megawatt Tekeze and 460 megawatt Tana Beles power plants.
Those lines will be completed next year, Mekuria said.  By March 2013, another power line should be completed to
Kenya, in time for the scheduled opening of the 1,870 megawatt
Gibe III project later that year, Mekuria said. The amount
exported will depend on the size of the surplus.  A new five-year national growth plan aims to quadruple
power generation to at least 8,000 megawatts and expand
electricity coverage to 75 percent of the population from 41
percent. This needs $11 billion of investment, Mekuria said. New
hydropower plants, supplemented by wind and geothermal projects,
will mean supply matches a projected annual demand increase of
32 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
