Britain’s cold snap was so severe
that it forced car drivers onto buses and trains, reducing the
revenue impact on transport companies from closed routes,
Stagecoach Group Plc said today.  The sales drop after the U.K.’s most widespread November
snowfall since 1993 was “relatively minor,” Stagecoach said,
with motorists in Scotland and cities such as Newcastle upon
Tyne in northern England switching to public transport as local
roads iced up, according to Brian Souter, the company’s founder.  “Where we are operating the buses were actually getting a
lot of passengers becasue people can’t get their cars out,”
Souter said on a conference call after Perth-based Stagecoach
announced a 72 percent jump in first-half net income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
