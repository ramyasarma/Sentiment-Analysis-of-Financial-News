China CNR Corp.  and CSR Corp., the
nation’s largest trainmakers, jumped in Shanghai trading after a
report that the government is planning to spend as much as 4
trillion yuan ($600 billion) expanding rail networks.  CSR  rose 7 percent to 7.69 yuan and China CNR surged 6
percent to 6.74 yuan. Builder China Railway Group Ltd. jumped
2.3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1 percent.  China may make the rail investment as part of a five-year
plan starting next year as it works to ease transport
bottlenecks and spread economic development, the China
Securities Journal said today, citing an unidentified person.
The country also formed ventures with Alstom SA and Bombardier
Inc. this week to help develop new rail systems.  “Rail suppliers are sure to benefit from the investment
plans as it will boost demand for their products,” said  Liang Futao , a research manager at Changjiang Pension Insurance Co.
“Foreign companies will also benefit because China needs their
advanced technology.”  Calls to  Wang Yongping , a spokesman at the railway ministry
in Beijing, went unanswered.  Jinxi Axle Co. , a manufacturer of railroad axles, surged by
the 10 percent limit. China Railway Erju Co., a railway
construction company, climbed 3 percent.  In Hong Kong, CSR, which has a trainmaking venture with
 General Electric Co. , rose 6.7 percent. China Railway Group
climbed 2.8 percent.  -- Jiang Jianguo . Editors:  Neil Denslow ,  Terje Langeland   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
