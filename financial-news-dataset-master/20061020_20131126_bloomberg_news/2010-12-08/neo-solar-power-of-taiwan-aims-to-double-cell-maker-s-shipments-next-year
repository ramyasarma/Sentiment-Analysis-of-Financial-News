Neo Solar Power Corp. , Taiwan’s
third-largest solar-cell maker by market value, said it aims to
double shipments in 2011 as demand rises.  The company may ship 1 gigawatt of cells next year, from an
estimated 500 megawatts in 2010, Chairman  Quincy Lin  said today.
The solar-cell maker may sell shares in 2011 to help fund
expansion, he said, without giving details.  Global installations of solar panels may more than double
to 15.8 gigawatts this year as developers seek to set up systems
and benefit from government incentives, according to technology
researcher  Isuppli . Demand may rise to 19.3 gigawatts in 2011,
Isuppli said last month.  “In order to catch market opportunities, we’ll raise funds
from equity,” Lin told reporters in Taipei.  Annual production capacity of Neo Solar, based in Hsinchu,
Taiwan, may increase to 1.2 gigawatts by the end of next year,
from 800 megawatts currently, Lin said. One megawatt can power
about 800 U.S. homes.  The company plans capital spending of NT$10 billion ($331
million) for next year, more than double from NT$4.5 billion in
2010, as it expands capacity, Lin said.  The  shares  climbed 1 percent to close at NT$74.50 in Taipei
trading. The stock has fallen 2.8 percent this year, compared
with the 6.3 percent gain in the benchmark Taiex index.  Net income reached NT$1.96 billion in the first nine months,
compared with a loss of NT$699 million a year earlier, the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said in a statement on Oct. 20.
Sales surged 93 percent to NT$13.4 billion.  Motech Industries Inc. and Gintech Energy Corp. are
Taiwan’s biggest solar-cell makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
