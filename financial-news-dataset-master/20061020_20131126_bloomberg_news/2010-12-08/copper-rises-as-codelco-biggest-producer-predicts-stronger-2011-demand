Copper rose in New York and London as
Codelco, the world’s largest producer of the metal, predicted
stronger demand next year.  The company sees demand gaining between 4 percent and 5
percent, Chief Executive Officer Diego Hernandez said yesterday
in an interview, adding that copper may average near $4 a pound
in 2011. That compares with $3.3858 so far this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Copper advanced to a 31-month high
yesterday on the Comex in New York.  “This latest price surge has its roots embedded firmly in
a mix of concentrate supply constraints which has limited output
to a miserly increase of just 1.5 percent this year against
burgeoning demand from emerging markets led by China,”  Alex Heath , head of industrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of Canada
Europe Ltd. in London, said in a report.  Copper for delivery in March rose 2.9 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $4.0785 a pound on the Comex at 9:14 a.m. New York
time, erasing a decline of as much as 1.8 percent. Prices
yesterday reached $4.1315, the highest level since May 5, 2008.
Copper for delivery in three months added 0.6 percent to $8,932
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 1.6 percent to
$25,600 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,500 on Nov. 9. The
metal has jumped 51 percent this year, leading advances on the
exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  PT Timah, Indonesia’s largest producer of the metal, said
2011 tin output may be less than 40,000 tons because of rainfall
throughout the year.  Aluminum gained 1.1 percent to $2,331 a ton and nickel lost
0.4 percent to $24,000 a ton. Lead added 0.8 percent to $2,420 a
ton and zinc added 0.2 percent to $2,310 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
