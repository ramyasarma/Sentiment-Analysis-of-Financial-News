DeNA Co. shares plunged in Tokyo
after the games developer confirmed it’s under investigation by
the nation’s Fair Trade Commission.  The shares fell as much as 8.2 percent to 2,480 yen in
afternoon trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, giving up an
earlier 2.4 percent gain.  The Japanese operator of the Mobage-town gaming website may
have tried to bar game developers from providing content to
competitor Gree Inc., the Nikkei newspaper reported.  A DeNA spokesman, Tetsuhiro Kaneko, confirmed the
commission is investigating the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
