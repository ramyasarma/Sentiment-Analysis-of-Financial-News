Julian Assange , founder of the
 WikiLeaks  website that posted thousands of secret U.S.
documents, said Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s
condemnation of his actions is “disgraceful.”  Assange, an Australian citizen, wrote today in an  editorial 
in the Australian newspaper that the publishing of U.S. military
and State Department documents has resulted in death threats for
him and suggestions his son be kidnapped. In contrast, the
response to media organizations that have also released the
material has been muted, he said.  “Australians should observe with no pride the disgraceful
pandering to these sentiments by Julia Gillard and her
government,” he wrote. “The powers of the Australian
government appear to be fully at the disposal of the U.S. as to
whether to cancel my Australian passport, or spy on or harass
WikiLeaks supporters.”  Assange, 39, accused the U.S. and Australia of hypocrisy by
saying both that the leaks will endanger lives and that there is
nothing of importance in the documents.  “WikiLeaks has a four-year publishing history,” he wrote.
“During that time we have changed whole governments, but not a
single person, as far as anyone is aware, has been harmed.”  His website drew condemnation for posting classified
documents including U.S. embassy communications and a military
video of a July 2007 helicopter attack in Iraq that killed a
Reuters television cameraman and his driver. The cables have
been the subject of articles in newspapers including the New
York Times, the Guardian and Der Spiegel.  Assange yesterday was denied bail in the U.K. at an
extradition hearing over rape allegations in Sweden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
