Coffee-producing countries are
expected to earn a record $16.5 billion from exports in the 2010
calendar year because of rising prices, even as volumes decline,
the International Coffee Organization said.  “The $16.5 billion is not definitive yet, it is still a
forecast, but we are confident we will surpass the record this
year,”  Jose Sette , the organization’s acting executive director,
said at a conference in Ho Chi Minh City today.  Supply problems in many producing countries have prevented
exporters from taking advantage of a surge in prices, Sette said.
Exports may fall to around 94 million bags this year, from a
high of 97.7 million in 2008, he said. There is “simply no
coffee to make available to the world market” in addition to
current supplies, he said.  Robusta-coffee futures in London have jumped 44 percent
this year, advancing to $2,098 a metric ton on Nov. 9, the
highest level in more than two years, as rains delayed the
Vietnam harvest. Arabica futures in New York soared to a 13-year
high of $2.2145 a pound on Nov. 10 and have increased 54 percent
this year.  The value of coffee exports in 2009 fell to $13.3 billion,
compared with $15.4 billion a year earlier, according to the ICO.  The tighter coffee market will leave stocks of the Arabica
variety “fairly low” entering the 2011-2012 season, VM Group
said in a quarterly report published with ABN Amro on Nov. 30.
Arabica production from Brazil, the world’s largest producer, is
expected to decline as its trees “go into the ‘off’ period of
their biannual cycle,” it said.  Brazil’s coffee production is subject to an alternating
cycle, in which trees produce less every other year.  Shrinking Inventories  Coffee stockpiles in producing nations dropped to about 12
million bags this year, the lowest level since the ICO began
keeping records in the 1960s, Sette said last month.  “As we go into the 2011 season with historically low world
stock levels, and with Brazil entering its lower-yielding year
of its biennial cycle, we fear that the global coffee supply
shortfall will become very acute indeed,” Macquarie Group Ltd.
said in a report distributed Nov. 26.  Coffee output for the 2010-2011 crop year in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest grower of the Robusta variety used in instant
drinks, will decline about 20 percent from the previous harvest
of 1.1 million tons, Luong Van Tu, chairman of the Vietnam
Coffee & Cocoa Association, said at the conference today.  “We have had both droughts and rains, and the unexpected
rains lately have delayed the harvesting and affected the crops
in many areas,” Luong Van Tu, chairman of the Vietnam Coffee &
Cocoa Association.  The Vietnamese coffee harvest, which typically starts on
Oct. 1, was delayed by at least a month because of rain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
