Cotton futures rose for the first
time in three days on speculation that government efforts in
China, the world’s biggest fiber consumer, won’t erode demand.  China’s central bank may raise borrowing costs again in a
shift to a more “prudent” monetary policy, according to the
ruling Communist Party’s Politburo. Cotton has surged 75 percent
this year on signs that demand will outpace dwindling worldwide
supplies.  China’s efforts won’t have a “lasting effect,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana. “You
could cool it some, and you’re still not really going to hurt
demand.”  Cotton for March delivery climbed 1.58 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $1.3195 a pound at 2:46 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price declined 1.5 percent in the
previous two days.  On Nov. 10, the fiber reached $1.5195, the highest since
the commodity began trading 140 years ago.  China may import 15 million bales in the year ending July
31 to help meet domestic demand, the USDA  said  on Nov. 9. That
would be up from 10.9 million a year earlier, the agency said.
The department will update its projections on Dec. 10. A bale
weighs about 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
