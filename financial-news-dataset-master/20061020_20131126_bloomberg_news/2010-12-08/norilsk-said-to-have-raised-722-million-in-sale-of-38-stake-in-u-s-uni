OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s
largest mining company, sold 38 percent of its U.S. unit
 Stillwater Mining Co.  for $722 million in a public offering,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Norilsk sold 37 million shares at $19.50 each, the people
said. The price is 5 percent below yesterday’s close in New
York, valuing the company at $1.9 billion, according to
Bloomberg calculations. Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., UBS AG and VTB Capital were running the sale.  Norilsk may offer another 9.8 million shares in the form of
an issue of so-called mandatory exchangeable notes by UBS,
according to a regulatory filing on Nov. 29.  Including over-allotment stocks, Norilsk may offload its
entire 49.8 million shares in  Stillwater . The mining company
decided this year to sell the stake because it doesn’t have
operational control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
