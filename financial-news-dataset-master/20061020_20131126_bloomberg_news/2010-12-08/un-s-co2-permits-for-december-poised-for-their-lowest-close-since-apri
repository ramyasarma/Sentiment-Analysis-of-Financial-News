United Nations emission credits fell
to their lowest level in eight months after supplies were
boosted last month from market regulators.  UN credits for  December  declined 9 cents, or 0.8 percent to
11.54 euros ($15.29) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, the lowest close since April 5.  The executive board overseeing the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism issued 17.8 million tons of credits on Nov. 29, mostly
to hydrofluorocarbon-23-cutting projects, according to UN
website data. That’s the most for any single day and makes
November the biggest month for new supply since issuance started
in October 2005, according to IDEAcarbon, the London company
that rates projects.  Factories and power stations can use a portion of UN
credits to cover their emissions. European Union permits for
December lost 12 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 14.67 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
