Asian stocks  fell by the most in two
weeks on speculation China will raise interest rates to help
stem inflation in the world’s fastest growing major economy,
curbing demand for commodities.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil producer, declined
2.4 percent in Hong Kong. Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, dropped 2 percent.  Sumco Corp. , a
Japanese maker of silicon wafers for semiconductors, slumped 9.6
percent in Tokyo after forecasting a wider full-year net loss.
 Sony Corp. , the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles, rose 1.9 percent as the dollar gained against regional
currencies, raising expectations exporters’ profit will improve.  “Markets tend to go hot and cold on expectations that
Chinese authorities will take more steps in their tightening
campaign,” said  Nader Naeimi , a Sydney-based strategist at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which manages about $93 billion and is a
unit of AMP Ltd., Australia’s second-largest asset manager.
“There is pressure on interest rates in China, but I don’t
think there’s any reason they’d would want to crush growth.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.8 percent to 132.64
as of 5:46 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest drop since Nov. 26. About
the same number of stocks rose as fell. The gauge slid 0.6
percent last month after two straight monthly gains as concern
grew that China’s anti-inflation measures, Europe’s debt crisis
and tensions on the Korean peninsula may cool the global
economic recovery.  Rate Speculation  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  fell 1 percent after the
government’s statistics bureau brought forward the release of
November economic data on inflation, retail sales, industrial
output and fixed-asset investments by two days to Dec. 11. The
move heightened speculation the People’s Bank of China will
raise interest rates this weekend. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index 
decreased 1.4 percent.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index  lost 0.4 percent, erasing gains
of as much as 0.4 percent earlier, after North Korea fired
artillery shells into its own waters near the disputed western
border with South Korea today, Yonhap News reported.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  increased 0.9 percent, its
highest close since June 21. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained
0.4 percent, while Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  slipped 0.6
percent.  Expectations that the central bank will raise borrowing
costs again have grown after the ruling Communist Party
announced on Dec. 3 the country will shift to a “prudent”
monetary policy next year from a “moderately loose” stance as
the government seeks to combat accelerating inflation.  Sumco Slides  Cnooc dropped 2.4 percent to HK$17.92. Jiangxi Copper
decreased 2 percent to HK$24.75.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. ,
the nation’s biggest producer of the metal, slid 1.7 percent to
HK$7.14.  In Tokyo, Sumco tumbled 9.6 percent to 1,211 yen. The
silicon-wafer maker widened its full-year loss forecast to 66
billion yen ($789 million) from 12 billion yen and Credit Suisse
Group AG cut its rating on the company to “underperform.”  Australian banks declined even after home-loan approvals
rose for a fourth straight month in October.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  held the
benchmark rate at 4.75 percent yesterday after a quarter
percentage-point rise last month. A recovery in demand for home
loans, which tumbled for seven straight months through April as
the RBA embarked on the most aggressive round of rate increases
by a Group of 20 member, may be dependent on the timing of more
rate changes, economists said.  Australia Lending Weakness  “We expect further weakness in new housing credit for the
remainder of 2010 and into 2011,” said David Cannington, an
economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
Melbourne. “Weak growth in house prices combined with the
increased cost of servicing housing debt will continue to lower
the incentive for home buyers to rush into the market.”  ANZ Banking Group fell 1.5 percent to A$23.15.  Westpac
Banking Group Ltd. , Australia’s second-largest bank by market
value, lost 0.8 percent to A$21.76. National Australia Bank Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest lender to companies, declined 1.4 percent
to A$23.62.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, after surging 1
percent to a two-year high earlier. U.S. stocks pared gains in
the final hour of trading, pulling the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index down from a two-year high, after a probe of insider
trading reportedly widened and President  Barack Obama  said he’ll
push to overhaul the tax code in two years.  Dollar Advances  The dollar rose against most of its major counterparts as
Treasury yields surged on speculation an agreement to extend tax
cuts will boost the economy, increasing demand for U.S. assets.
The greenback rallied against the euro and the yen after Obama 
broke a stalemate about extending middle-class tax cuts
introduced by the administration of  George W. Bush .  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.55 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 82.51 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened
to 110.81 from 110.11. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Among Japanese exporters, Sony Corp., which gets about 70
percent of sales outside of Japan, gained 1.9 percent to 3,040
yen. Konami climbed 5.4 percent to 1,703 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. ,
the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 0.8 percent to 3,280 yen.  In Seoul, Hyundai Motor increased 1.1 percent to 180,000
won.  Kia Motors Corp. , South Korea’s second-biggest automaker,
gained 0.6 percent to 51,900 won. The won depreciated to as low
as 1,145.30 today, compared with 1,130.55 at the close of
trading yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 9.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 7.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
