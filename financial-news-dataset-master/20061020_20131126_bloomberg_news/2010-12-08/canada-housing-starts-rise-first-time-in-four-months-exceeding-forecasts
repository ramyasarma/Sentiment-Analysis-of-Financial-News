Canadian  housing starts  rose in
November for the first time in four months, Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp. reported.  Starts advanced 11.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual pace of 187,200 from a revised 167,800 rate in October,
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.  said  from Ottawa today. The
reading exceeded all 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
that had a median estimate of 173,000 units.  Housing starts will drop to 174,800 units in 2011 from an
estimated 186,200 units this year, Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corp. said Nov. 15. The Bank of Canada said in October that
housing will be a drag on economic growth next year, after
temporary stimulus measures for homeowners lapsed.  “Looking ahead into 2011, housing starts will gradually
become more closely aligned to demographic demand, which is
currently estimated at about 175,000 units per year,” the
agency said today in a statement posted on its website.  Urban multiple-unit  housing rose  20.9 percent to 101,800
units, the report said. Single-family starts in cities increased
5.5 percent to 61,300 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
