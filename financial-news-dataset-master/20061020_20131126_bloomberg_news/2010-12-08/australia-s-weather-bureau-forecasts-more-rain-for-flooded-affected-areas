Australia’s weather bureau is warning
of flooding in five of the nation’s eight states and territories
as New South Wales, already suffering from the worst flooding in
20 years, braces for more rain.  The Bureau of Meteorology has flood warnings in place for
Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania, according to information on its  website . People in
some parts of New South Wales have been told that rain may lead
to flash flooding, the bureau said in a warning issued at 6:29
a.m. today.  Australia had its wettest September-to-November spring on
record, weather bureau data show. Heavy rain and flooding, the
worst in two decades, has isolated hundreds of people in New
South Wales and forced 750 people to evacuate their homes,
according to the  State Emergency Service .  New South Wales’ State Emergency Service has had more than
1,850 requests for assistance for flood-affected communities
since Nov. 29, it said on its website today. Many rural
properties have been isolated by the rain, it said.  Rain in Queensland has depleted stockpiles at mines,
disrupting deliveries of coal to the Dalrymple Bay export
terminal at Hay Point port in Queensland state, General Manager
Greg Smith said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
