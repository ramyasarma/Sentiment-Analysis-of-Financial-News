             Bodycote International Plc (BOY) , the U.K.
metal-treatment company that spurned a takeover offer from  Sulzer
AG (SUN)  earlier this month, said first-quarter sales grew 22 percent,
buoyed by purchases and demand from energy customers.  
 Sales at the heat treatment unit rose 14 percent from a year
earlier, increasing in all geographic regions with the exception
of the U.S., the Macclesfield-based company said in a statement
today. Its operating profit margin widened 1 percentage point.  
 Bodycote, which on April 18 spurned Sulzer's sweetened 1.07
billion-pound bid as too low, said demand from oil and gas
customers was ``robust,'' while sales to carmakers in North
America showed no growth. The company is evaluating a number of
potential acquisitions and it expects to spend about 60 million
pounds ($120 million) this year on purchases.  
 ``Trading looks very positive,'' said David Gorman, an
analyst at WH Ireland Ltd. in Manchester,  England  with a ``hold''
recommendation on the stock. ``Sulzer should be encouraged by
this to offer more. Bodycote would strongly argue there is more
value in the company than what's been offered.''  
 Shares of Bodycote rose 8 pence, or 2.6 percent, to 315
pence, giving a market value of 1.02 billion pounds. The stock
has advanced 36 percent since Jan. 25, the day before the company
first said it was aware of takeover speculation.  
 Gorman said an offer of 15 pence more a share might be
enough to clinch a deal. A bid at the price would value the U.K.
company at 1.12 billion pounds.  
 Acquisitions  
 Bodycote, which strengthens metal for aerospace, power-generation, rail and engineering clients, made 17 purchases last
year and those transactions will likely add 100 million pounds to
revenue in 2007. The U.K. company is expanding a division that
tests the endurance of metals, cement and glass, with 12 of the
acquisitions added to that unit. Testing now accounts for more
than a quarter of sales.  
 Revenue generated by testing jumped 53 percent at constant
exchange rates. The company is opening sites in  Brazil ,  Turkey ,
Saudi Arabia,  Croatia  and Kazakhstan to tap demand from
manufacturers moving production there.  
 ``The board expects all markets in which the group operates,
except for automotive, to remain buoyant,'' the company said.
``Automotive has improved since the end of 2006 in Europe and
especially in  France , but North America continues to be muted.''  
 Once adjusted for currency movements, a weaker dollar slowed
first-quarter sales growth to 16 percent. If exchange rates
remain at the current level, sales and operating profit will be 3
percent higher this year, the statement said.  
 Bodycote's treatment processes put metal under intense
weight and heat to remove air bubbles and improve durability,
according to its Web site, making a harder-wearing material
suitable for use in high-stress applications such as jet engines
and Formula One racing cars.
