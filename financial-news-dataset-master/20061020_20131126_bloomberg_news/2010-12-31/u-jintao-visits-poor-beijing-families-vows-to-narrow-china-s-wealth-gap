Chinese President Hu Jintao visited
low-income families in Beijing yesterday in a gesture to show
the government is trying to narrow the widening wealth gap in
the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  “The party and the government attach high importance to
the issues of people’s welfare,” Hu said on the 7 p.m. news on
state-run  China Central Television  last night, “There will be
more measures to improve the lives of the people in
difficulty.”  The government’s effort to provide better social welfare to
low-income people comes as China’s Gini coefficient, a measure
of inequality, reached 0.47 in 2009, exceeding the 0.4 mark used
as a predictor for social unrest, according to World Bank data.  The Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said
yesterday that it will raise the minimum wage by 20.8 percent in
2011 to 1,160 yuan ($175) a month and increase pension and
unemployment benefits. Inflation reached 5.1 percent in
November, the highest in 28 months.  The program also showed Hu asking Guo Chunping, a woman
living in low-cost government housing, whether she can keep up
with the 77 yuan rent a month for a two-bedroom apartment.  Hu urged the government to boost capital investment and
land supply in the building of affordable and low-rental housing
to “ensure the supply of practical and cheap housing for low-
income people,” CCTV said.  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
