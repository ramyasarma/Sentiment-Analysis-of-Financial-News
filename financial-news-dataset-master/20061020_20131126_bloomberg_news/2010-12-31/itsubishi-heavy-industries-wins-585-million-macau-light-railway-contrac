  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd .,
Japan’s biggest heavy-machinery maker, won a 4.69 billion pataca
($585 million) contract to build a light rail system in Macau
after beating rival bids led by  Bombardier Inc . and  Siemens AG .  The railway will begin operations in 2014, the Macau
government said in a  statement  on its website yesterday. The 21-
kilometer (13 mile) long first phase will include 21 stations,
it said.  The initial route will connect the city’s eastern coastal
areas, while phase two will run through the western harbor
region, the ministry said. Macau, the world’s largest casino hub,
has increased infrastructure spending as economic growth in
mainland China boosts visitor numbers.  Bombardier and partner China Road & Bridge Corp. bid 4.57
billion patacas to build the railway, while Siemens and China
Civil Engineering Construction Corp. bid 6.28 billion patacas,
the transport  ministry  said. Mitsubishi Heavy had the highest
rating under a points system, it said.  Macau’s visitor numbers rose 15 percent in the first 11
months of the year to 22.7 million, according to the Macau
Statistics and Census Service. More than 80 percent of visitors
come from China and Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
