  South Korea  discovered H5N1 avian
influenza at two poultry farms in southern regions and raised
its alert level for the disease by one notch.  Local authorities destroyed 10,000 ducks at a farm in
Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, and 17,000 chickens at a
farm in Iksan, North Jeolla Province, and restricted poultry
movement near the areas, the Ministry for Food, Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said today in an e-mailed statement.  The government raised its bird flu warning to “caution”
from “attention,” the lowest level, the statement said. The
North Asian nation found three cases of the highly pathogenic
strain in wild birds earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
