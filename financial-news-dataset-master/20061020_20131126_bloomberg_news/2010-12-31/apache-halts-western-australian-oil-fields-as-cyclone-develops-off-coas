  Apache Corp . and  Woodside Petroleum
Ltd . halted oil fields off Western Australia because of a
tropical low system forecast to become a cyclone. Inbound iron
ore shipments to Port Hedland are also suspended.  Woodside stopped production at its Vincent and Cossack oil
fields, Laura Hammer, a spokeswoman, said from Perth today.
Apache has halted its Stag and Legendre fields, according to
David Parker, a Perth-based company spokesman.  The tropical low is forecast to pass over Broome later
today with heavy rains and strong winds, the  Bureau of
Meteorology  said in an update on its website. The low pressure
system is likely to intensify into a tropical cyclone off the
Pilbara coast tomorrow, reaching Category three on the five-step
Saffir-Simpson scale, the bureau said.  Apache has also evacuated all non-essential staff from its
Varanus Island gas-processing plant because of the storm, Parker
said in a telephone interview. Varanus Island continues to
operate, he said.  Inbound iron-ore shipments to Port Hedland, the world’s
largest bulk export terminal, have been suspended,  BHP Billiton
Ltd . spokeswoman Kelly Quirke said by phone.  Vessels currently in the harbor may depart once they are
loaded, while ships moored outside of Port Hedland have been
advised to lift anchor and depart from the area today, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
