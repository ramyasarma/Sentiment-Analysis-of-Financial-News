  DirecTV  reached an agreement with
Hearst Corp.’s television division, averting the loss of local
TV stations to its satellite-TV customers.  “We’re happy to have reached a fair agreement that will
allow Hearst’s local broadcast networks to remain available to
our customers,” Robert Mercer, a spokesman for El Segundo,
California-based DirecTV, said today in an e-mail.  Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. At least seven
blackouts occurred in 2010 because of fee disputes, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. At risk for DirecTV were signals
from ABC, CBS and NBC stations that Hearst owns in Boston,
Pittsburgh and Baltimore, among other markets.    Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc ., based in Hunt Valley,
Maryland, and New York-based  Time Warner Cable Inc . are seeking
a new agreement to replace a contract that expires tomorrow at
midnight. Viacom Inc., the New York-based owner of MTV, Comedy
Central and Nickelodeon, and St. Louis-based Suddenlink
Communications are also in talks on a new pact.  DirecTV, the biggest U.S. satellite-TV provider, fell 1
cent to $40.09 today in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
have climbed 20 percent this year. Closely held Hearst is based
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
