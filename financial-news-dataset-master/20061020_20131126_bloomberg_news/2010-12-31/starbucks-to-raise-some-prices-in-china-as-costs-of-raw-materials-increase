  Starbucks Corp ., the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, said it will increase prices on some
Frappuccino products in China by as much as 2 yuan (30
cents) from tomorrow as raw material costs rise.  The markup, which will be the first since 2007, is made to
“reflect price increases in commodities and raw materials,”
spokeswoman Caren Li said in a telephone interview today.  China will be Starbucks’ biggest growth market in two
years, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in November.
The Seattle-based coffee chain aims to increase the number of
outlets in the world’s most populous nation to 1,500 by 2015,
from about 400.  Starbucks will cut prices by one to two yuan for some other
products such as vanilla latte, Li said.  Sales at China’s coffee shops more than tripled to 35
million yuan in 2009 from 11 million yuan in 2004, according to
data from Euromonitor International. Starbucks dominated the
market with a 70 percent share last year, compared with No. 2
player Jiangsu Yueda Group Co. which operates Costa Coffee
restaurants with 5 percent share, according to the researcher.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
