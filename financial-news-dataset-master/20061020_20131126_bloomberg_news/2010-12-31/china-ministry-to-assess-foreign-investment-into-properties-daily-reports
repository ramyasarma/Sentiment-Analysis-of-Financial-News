China’s regulators will regularly
assess foreign investment in the nation’s  property market  as
part of its efforts to curb surging prices, the  China  Daily
reported.  The nation’s housing ministry will work together with the
Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange to monitor overseas capital inflows into the property
market, the report said, citing unidentified people.  Home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose for an 18th month in
November, even after the government raised borrowing costs,
suspended mortgages for third-home purchases and pledged to
introduce a property tax. Foreign investment in China’s property
market rose 48 percent to $20.1 billion in the first 11 months,
more than double the 17.7 percent increase in the country’s
total overseas inflows, official data show.  The Ministry of Commerce last week ordered local
authorities to halt approvals of some foreign property
investments to curb speculative buying. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
Dec. 26 that measures to curb the real estate market weren’t
well implemented and the government will introduce new steps to
crack down on speculation.  China will step up its review of projects by foreign
companies and verify more data for the industry after it noticed
faster growth in overseas investment this year, Yao Jian, a
Commerce Ministry spokesman, said in Beijing last month.  --Luo Jun. Editors: Malcolm Scott, Philip Lagerkranser  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
