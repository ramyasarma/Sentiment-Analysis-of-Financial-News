Japan may further ease regulations
on tourist visa applications for Chinese visitors, aiming to tap
growing travel demand among the nation’s emerging middle class,
the Nikkei newspaper said.  A relaxing of rules, which now require households to have
annual income of at least 100,000 yuan ($15,140), may come in
time for next summer after some deregulation last July increased
Chinese tourist numbers significantly, Nikkei reported, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
