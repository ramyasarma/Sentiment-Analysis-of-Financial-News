Mervyn Davies, the former Standard
Chartered Plc chairman who’s drawing up a strategy to increase
the number of women on U.K. company boards, said he’s “not
convinced” that setting quotas is the solution.  Davies, who was asked by Business Secretary Vince Cable in
August to draw up proposals on the subject for the government,
is scheduled to issue his recommendations in February. He said
in an article for today’s Guardian newspaper that he “will be
considering carefully” quotas before making his report,
according to an advance copy provided by the  Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills .  “Quotas have proved successful in some countries but many
of the women I have spoken with are against these,” Davies
wrote. “I have not ruled them out as a recommendation but at
the moment I am not convinced that they are the right method to
encourage progress.”  A study of FTSE 100 company boards published Dec. 2 showed
the proportion of women at senior levels in companies is around
12.5 percent. The Female FTSE Board Report by  Cranfield
University School of Management  found that among FTSE 250
companies the proportion was around 7.8 percent.  “There needs to be more pressure on companies to open up
their recruitment process and to bring women up the ranks from
within the business,” Davies wrote. “Companies could be
required to provide board internships to give senior staff the
experience of what it means to be on a board.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
