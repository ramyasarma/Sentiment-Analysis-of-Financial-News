Sugar futures in New York may rise
next week on concern that dry weather in Brazil, the world’s
biggest producer, and record rainfall in Australia will slash
supplies, according to a survey.  Five of eight traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in New York will rise.
Three predicted that prices will fall.  The commodity has declined 11 percent this week to 30.38
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Prices plunged 10
percent yesterday, the biggest slump in more than a month.  In the second half of this year, sugar has jumped 89
percent, the biggest gain among 19 raw materials in the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index. In 2010, the sweetener is up 13
percent. The price plunged 40 percent in the first half.  Four of eight survey respondents said refined sugar on the
NYSE Liffe exchange in London will gain. Four said it will fall.
The price has retreated 7.2 percent this week to $761.30 a
metric ton, heading for the biggest weekly loss since Nov. 12.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener will narrow,
according to three of seven people surveyed. Two said it will
widen and two said it will be little changed.  In the attached chart, red bars are derived by subtracting
bearish forecasts from bullish estimates for raw sugar, with
readings above zero signaling that most respondents expect
higher prices. The green line shows raw-sugar prices, and the
blue line shows white sugar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
