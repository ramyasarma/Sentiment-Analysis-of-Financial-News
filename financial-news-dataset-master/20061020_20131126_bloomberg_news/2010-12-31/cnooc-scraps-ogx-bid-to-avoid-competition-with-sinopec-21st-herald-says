  Cnooc Ltd ., China’s largest offshore
oil and gas producer, withdrew a plan to bid for a stake in
Brazil’s OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA to avoid
competition with China Petrochemical Corp., the 21st Century
Business Herald reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  China Petrochemical, also known as Sinopec Group, is still
evaluating whether to make a bid, the newspaper reported late
yesterday. Jiang Yongzhi, Beijing-based spokesman for Hong Kong-
listed Cnooc, declined to comment on the report. Huang Wensheng,
Beijing-based spokesman for Sinopec Group, also declined to
comment.  Cnooc and Sinopec Group may offer at least $7 billion for
Brazilian oil assets and a stake in OGX, two people with
knowledge of the matter said Sept. 10. No offer had been
presented and Cnooc hadn’t decided whether to make a joint bid,
one of the people said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
