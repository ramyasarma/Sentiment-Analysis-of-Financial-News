             ThyssenKrupp AG , Germany’s largest
steelmaker, said it will reduce output at some steel-processing
facilities in the third quarter.  
 So-called hot-strip capacity will be about 10 percent lower
in the quarter, mainly because of work at mills in Duisburg and
Bochum following upgrades, company spokesman  Dietmar Stamm  said
today in Duisburg.  
 ThyssenKrupp will carry out a “multi-week” shutdown at
its hot-dip coating line at Finnentrop for repairs after an
explosion in an aluminum bath, and will halt the continuous
annealing line in Dortmund for pollution-control upgrades.  
 The company said it will coordinate restrictions to
delivery capabilities with its customers. Steelmaking operations
will continue to run at full production because of “tight”
slab capacities, it said.
