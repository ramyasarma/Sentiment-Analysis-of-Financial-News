             Copper dropped for the first time in
five days, falling by the most in two weeks, on speculation
China’s State Reserve Bureau may sell some of its stockpiles
after prices rallied to the highest level in four months.  
 The three-month delivery contract lost as much as 1.4
percent, the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 25, to $7,601.25 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded at $7,630 at
3:08 p.m. in Singapore. The commodity climbed to $7,750 Sept. 3,
the highest level since April 27, after better-than-expected U.S.
jobs data eased concerns the economic recovery was faltering.  
 “There is talk today that the SRB might sell copper, and
while such rumors emerge from time to time, especially when
prices rally strongly, it does hurt investor sentiment,” said
 Liu Biyuan , an analyst at GF Futures Co. “Copper is also lower
because of the stronger dollar and weaker equities.”  
 China’s State Bureau of Material Reserve, also known as the
State Reserve Bureau, operates under the National Development
and Reform Commission, formulating strategy and managing state
buying of mineral reserves. The bureau bought 235,000 tons of
the metal last year, according to the China Nonferrous Metals
Industry Association. When contacted, an official at the bureau,
who did not wish to be identified, declined to comment.  
 “While it might make sense to sell now considering what
they paid for it, the bureau isn’t out to profit from market
moves,” said Wen Jinghai, an analyst at Bohai Futures Co. “If
they really do sell part of the stockpile, it will only be a
little at a time so as not to cause disruptions in the market.”  
 Shanghai Copper  
 Copper for December delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped by as much as 1.7 percent to 59,500 yuan
($8,766) a ton, before ending the session at 59,680 yuan. The
metal gained to 60,620 yuan yesterday, also the highest price
since April 27. Immediate-delivery copper in Changjiang,
Shanghai’s biggest cash market, traded at about 59,580 yuan
today, down 0.7 percent, the biggest drop in three weeks.  
 “Higher prices always make physical buyers shy away and
the market loses an important area of support,” Guan Jianxiong,
an analyst at Zhujiang Futures Co., said from Guangdong. “The
uptrend remains intact as economic data improves,” Guan said by
phone. Copper has surged 21 percent in the past year.  
 The  dollar  gained for a second day against a six-currency
basket including the euro. It rose the most in a week against
the 16-nation currency after the Association of German Banks
said that the nation’s 10 largest lenders, including Deutsche
Bank AG, may need about 105 billion euros ($134 billion) in
fresh capital because of new regulations.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell for the first day in five,
and stocks in China declined after a government official said a
slowdown in industrial output growth will deepen on real-estate
and energy curbs and the outlook for exports.  
 Aluminum in London declined 0.2 percent to $2,187.75 a ton,
zinc fell 0.8 percent to $2,179.50 a ton, and lead decreased 0.6
percent to $2,182 a ton. Nickel shed 1.1 percent to $21,900 a
ton and tin was little changed at $20,900 a ton.
