             Defense lawyers for Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned former head of oil company OAO
Yukos, say PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company’s auditor and
adviser, acted under pressure from the Russian government when
it withdrew its approval from Yukos’s financial statements, the
Wall Street Journal reported.  
 The lawyers say PwC wanted to protect its own business
interests in Russia and to avert the possibility of partners
going to jail, the newspaper said.  
 PwC said in a statement that it stands by its decision,
having acted on fresh information suggesting that Yukos’s former
management may have made “inaccurate representations,” the
Journal reported.  
 Russian prosecutors declined to comment, the newspaper
added.
