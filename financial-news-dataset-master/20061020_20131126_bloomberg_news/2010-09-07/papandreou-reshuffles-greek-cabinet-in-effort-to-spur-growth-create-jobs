             Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  reshuffled his Cabinet for the first time, demoting a
key minister in charge of growth. Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  retained his post.  
 Michalis Chrisochoides , who until now headed the police
ministry, will replace  Louka Katseli  as head of a revamped
economy and competitiveness ministry, government spokesman
 George Petalotis  said today in an  e-mailed statement . Katseli
will head a new employment and social security ministry, while
 Andreas Loverdos , who shepherded this year’s pension system
reform, was named head of the health ministry before a planned
overhaul to the state health system.  
 Papandreou is under pressure to revive growth and boost
jobs in an economy forecast to shrink 4 percent this year while
reducing the European Union’s second-biggest budget gap. The
government is implementing a three-year  deficit-cutting  plan in
return for 110 billion-euros ($126 billion) of emergency loans
from the EU and International Monetary Fund.  
 The Greek economy declined for a seventh quarter in the
three months to June as wage and pension cuts and tax increases
damped spending. The country is in a second year of recession as
key industries such as tourism and shipping are hurt by the
global crisis and austerity measures depress growth.  
 In other Cabinet appointments, Yiannis Diamantides will
head a new ministry for maritime, fishing and island affairs.
Costas Skandalidis was appointed agriculture minister, replacing
 Katerina Batzeli . Haris Pamboukis was named minister in charge
of investments while Papandreou relinquished his post of foreign
minister to his deputy,  Dimitris Droutsas .
