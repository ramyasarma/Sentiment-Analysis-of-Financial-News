             Most Chinese stocks rose as the
prospect the government will curb overcapacity to meet energy
efficiency targets fueled a rally for the nation’s biggest metal
producers.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index gained less than 0.1 percent
to 2,696.67 at 2:56 p.m. local time, erasing a loss of as much
as 0.6 percent.
