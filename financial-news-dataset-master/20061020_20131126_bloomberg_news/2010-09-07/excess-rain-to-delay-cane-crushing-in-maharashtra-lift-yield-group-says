             Sugar cane processing in India’s
biggest producing state may be delayed by an extended monsoon
season, which is improving prospects of higher yield and output,
a producers’ group said.  
 Mills in Maharashtra may not begin crushing from Oct. 1 as
planned if rain continues,  Prakash Naiknavare , managing director
of the  Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation
Ltd. , said in a phone interview. Most parts of India, including
Maharashtra, will get widespread showers until Sept. 11, the
state-owned forecaster said on its website.  
 “Heavy rain of this nature is unprecedented and unexpected
in mid-September and can upset our crushing plans,” Naiknavare
said. “The good thing is that this may add weight to standing
cane and boost production.”  
 Maharashtra’s output may exceed 8.6 million tons estimated
by the producers’ cooperative last month, he said. Cane harvest
may surpass 75 million tons estimated in August and this
season’s 57.6 million tons, he said.  
 India’s  monsoon  rainfall, the main source of irrigation for
the country’s 235 million farmers, is 100 percent of the 50-year
average this season, a level considered normal, according to the
 India Meteorological Department . Rain-bearing clouds will begin
to withdraw only in the second half of this month, the IMD said.  
 The June-September rainy season normally begins to retreat
from the northwestern parts of the country starting Sept. 1.
