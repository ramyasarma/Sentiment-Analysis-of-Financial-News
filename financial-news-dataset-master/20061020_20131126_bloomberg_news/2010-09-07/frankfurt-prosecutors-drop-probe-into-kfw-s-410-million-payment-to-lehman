             German prosecutors dropped a probe
into KfW Group managers over a 320 million-euro ($410 million)
payment to  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , German newspaper Die
Welt reported.  
 Frankfurt prosecutors investigated former and current KfW
managers over the automated payment to Lehman on Sept. 15, the
same day the New York-based securities firm filed the biggest
bankruptcy case in U.S. history. The probe was ended because
there was no evidence of wrongdoing, Die Welt said, citing the
prosecutor’s order on the case.  
 KfW hasn’t received the decision, spokesman Wolfram
Schweickhardt said in an interview with Bloomberg News today.
