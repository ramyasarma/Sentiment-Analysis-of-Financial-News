             Peyton Manning  and the Indianapolis
Colts are favored by Las Vegas oddsmakers to win the Super Bowl
after coming up short in their championship bid last season.  
 The Colts enter the regular season with 13-2 odds of
capturing their second National Football League title in five
years, according to Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which advises
Nevada’s sports books on betting lines.  
 The 34-year-old Manning led the Colts to an NFL-best 14-2
record last season and beat out New Orleans quarterback  Drew Brees  to win his fourth Most Valuable Player award before losing
to the Saints 31-17 in the Super Bowl.  
 “We’ve made some improvements almost in every area a
little bit, albeit somewhat incremental, but the true test comes
up (this) week,” Colts coach  Jim Caldwell  said. “That’s when
you can really start to gauge exactly who you are. But you can
make an assessment, and I think in a lot of areas we got
better.”  
 The 31-year-old Brees’s Saints are tied with the Dallas
Cowboys as the second Super Bowl choice with odds of 8-1.  
 The Saints are seeking to become the first repeat Super
Bowl champions since the New England Patriots after the 2003 and
2004 seasons. The Cowboys will aim to become the first franchise
to win the title game in its home stadium.  
 Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will be the site of
this season’s Super Bowl on Feb. 6, 2011.  
 Saints vs Vikings  
 The San Diego Chargers have 17-2 odds of winning the title,
followed by the Patriots at 9-1 and the Green Bay Packers and
Minnesota Vikings at 10-1.  
 The Saints host the Vikings and quarterback  Brett Favre  in
the NFL’s regular-season opener on Sept. 9. It’s a rematch of
last season’s conference championship game, which the Saints won
31-28 in overtime to reach the Super Bowl.  
 The Colts, one of two teams to go winless in the preseason,
open the regular season on Sept. 12 in Houston.  
 The New York Jets, who fell one win short of reaching the
Super Bowl last season, have 12-1 odds in the second season for
coach  Rex Ryan  and quarterback  Mark Sanchez .  
 The Jets have gained added attention this season from their
appearance on the HBO program “Hard Knocks,” which chronicled
their preseason training camp and the holdout of  Darrelle Revis ,
who yesterday ended a seven-month impasse by agreeing to a new
contract. The Jets will also be playing their first season in
the $1.6 billion New Meadowlands Stadium, which they share with
the New York Giants.  
 The Giants have championship odds of 15-1, just behind the
Baltimore Ravens at 14-1.  
 Improved Ravens  
 The Ravens had one of the biggest improvements in odds
during the offseason among top Super Bowl contenders, narrowing
from 24-1 after the acquisition of Pro Bowl wide receiver  Anquan Boldin .  
 The Pittsburgh Steelers’ odds rose to 20-1 from 12-1 after
quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger ’s suspension. Roethlisberger, who
was accused of sexually assaulting two women, will miss the
team’s first four games for violating the NFL’s personal conduct
policy. Roethlisberger denied the assaults.  
 The Washington Redskins went to 28-1 from 50-1 after adding
quarterback  Donovan McNabb  from the Philadelphia Eagles.  
 The Saints won the Super Bowl last season after entering
the year with 20-1 odds of winning the title. The Colts a year
ago were the sixth choice to win the championship at 12-1.
