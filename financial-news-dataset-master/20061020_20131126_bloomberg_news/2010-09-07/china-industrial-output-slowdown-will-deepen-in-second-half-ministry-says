             China’s slowdown in  industrial
output growth  will deepen after the smallest increase in 11
months in July, a government forecast showed today.  
 Production will gain about 10 percent in the second half of
2010 from a year earlier, the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology said at a briefing in Beijing today. That
compares with July’s 13.4 percent and the 17.6 percent average
for the first half of the year. August data is due next week.  
 “Economic growth will slow further,” said  Xin Guobin , the
head of the ministry’s operation monitoring and coordination
bureau. He cited real-estate and energy curbs, an uncertain
outlook for  exports , and a higher base for comparisons as
reasons for smaller output gains.  
 China’s economy, the world’s second biggest after
overtaking Japan in the second quarter, is still growing
steadily and isn’t at risk of a “second dip,” Xin told
reporters. UBS AG forecasts the nation’s growth to keep slowing
from a first-quarter peak, cooling to between 8 percent and 8.5
percent in the final three months of the year.  
 Industrial output may grow 13 percent for the full year,
Xin said.
