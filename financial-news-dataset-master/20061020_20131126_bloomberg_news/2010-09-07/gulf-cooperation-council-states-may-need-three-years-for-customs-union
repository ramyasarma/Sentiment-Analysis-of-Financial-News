             The six-member Gulf Cooperation
Council may need as many as three years for full implementation
of a regional customs union agreement, Kuwait’s Finance Minister
said.  
 “Not all countries are ready,”  Mustafa al-Shimali  told
reporters late yesterday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. “We need more
time to implement the remaining items.”  
 The region’s customs union has been hindered by differences
over how to distribute revenue earned from tariffs, al-Shimali
said. The group also needs to remove some tariffs on specific
goods, he said.  
 Gulf countries agreed on a single currency in 2001, saying
it would help integrate their economies. Their original
timetable would have seen a new monetary unit in place this
year. The deadline was missed after the global financial crisis
and the U.A.E. and Oman withdrew from the currency union.  
 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain took a step on
March 30 toward a single currency when their central bank
governors held the first meeting of the Monetary Council, a
precursor to a united central bank. Kuwait’s dinar is pegged to
a basket of currencies while the other three countries have a
dollar peg.
