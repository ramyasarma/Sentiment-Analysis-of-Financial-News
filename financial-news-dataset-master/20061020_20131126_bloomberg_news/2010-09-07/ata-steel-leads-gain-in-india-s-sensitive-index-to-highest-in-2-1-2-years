             India’s benchmark stock index
extended gains for a second day from the highest level in more
than 2 1/2 years amid expectations domestic companies will
benefit from spending aimed at bolstering the U.S. economy.  
 Tata Steel Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer of the alloy,
led metal producers higher after U.S. President  Barack Obama 
proposed a $50 billion spending plan.  Idea Cellular Ltd.  jumped
the most in more than six weeks after Emirates Telecom Corp.
said it may invest in the phone company.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
rose 60.00, or 0.3 percent, to 18,620.05 at 11:01 a.m. in Mumbai,
set for its highest close since February 2008. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange gained 0.4 percent to
5,596.90. The  BSE 200 Index  added 0.5 percent to 2,395.01.  
 “With the domestic growth outlook intact, the U.S. plan
stands to benefit local companies by boosting demand and
appetite for riskier assets like stocks,” said R.K. Gupta, who
manages equities at Taurus Asset Management in New Delhi. He
declined to say how much he manages or what he’s buying and
selling.  
 Tata gained 0.8 percent to 580.35 rupees. Obama yesterday
called for a six-year program to fix roads, railways and
modernize the air-traffic control system.  Steel Authority of
India Ltd. , the nation’s second-biggest producer, rose 1.2
percent to 198 rupees.  
 Idea Cellular  
 Idea Cellular jumped 4.6 percent to 75 rupees, on course
for its highest close since July 23. Emirates Telecom, the
United Arab Emirates’ largest phone company known as Etisalat,
is considering investing in Idea Cellular to expand its business
in the world’s second-biggest wireless market.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  4.86 billion rupees  ($104
million) of Indian equities Sept. 3, raising total investments
in the stocks this year to 610.8 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
