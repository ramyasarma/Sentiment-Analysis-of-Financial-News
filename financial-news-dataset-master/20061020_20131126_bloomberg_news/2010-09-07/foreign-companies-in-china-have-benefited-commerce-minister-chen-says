             Foreign companies have benefited
through their investments in China, Commerce Minister Chen
Deming said today in a speech at an investment conference in
Xiamen today.  
 Chinese overseas investment is a “win-win” for recipient
countries and China, Chen said. Protectionism has been used in
the name of national security when it comes to Chinese
investment abroad, he said.
