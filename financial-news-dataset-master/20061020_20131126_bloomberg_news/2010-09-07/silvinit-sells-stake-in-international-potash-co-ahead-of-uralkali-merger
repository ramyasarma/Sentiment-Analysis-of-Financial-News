             OAO Silvinit , Russia’s biggest
potash producer, sold its 32 percent stake in trader
 International Potash Co.  and may coordinate its sales strategy
with rival producer OAO Uralkali.  
 Silvinit didn’t provide any financial details of the
transaction, which was announced in a statement on the company’s
 website .  Anton Subbotin , a spokesman for Silvinit, declined to
comment on the details of the sale.  
 Russian billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov  and partners acquired
controlling stakes in Uralkali and Silvinit between June and
August and are seeking to merge the two potash producers.  
 Russia may allow the merger of the two producers,  Andrei Tsyganov , deputy chief of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, said
last month. One option could be to combine Uralkali and Silvinit
with Minsk, Belarus-based Belarusian Potash Co., a trader
representing Uralkali and Belaruskali, he said at the time.  
 The sale “does not mean that Silvinit is completely
parting with its trader,” VTB Capital analyst  Elena Sakhnova 
wrote in a note today. Silvinit’s sales are likely to remain
“formally” with IPC, while the company’s marketing strategy
“will be put into the hands of BPC,” Sakhnova wrote.
