             Pakistan, Asia’s third-largest sugar
user, may buy as much as 500,000 metric tons of the raw variety
by December because it is cheaper than white sugar, according to
the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association.  
 “Refined sugar costs 73 rupees (90 cents) a kilogram on
landing at Karachi Port, while raw costs 50 rupees,” Iskandar
Khan, chairman, said. “The country can save millions at a time
when it has lost billions in the recent floods.”  
 The country is facing its worst-ever floods, with damages
estimated at $7 billion, Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani
said in his address on national radio Sept. 3. Sugar cane output
in the year ending October is estimated at 3.8 million tons,
compared with demand of 4.2 million tons.  
 “Demand may rise for the new season by 100,000 tons, which
will create a shortfall of 500,000 tons,” Akram Burq, spokesman
for the industries ministry, said Sept. 3. “We hope the floods
have destroyed only 5 percent of our sugar cane crop,” he said,
without providing an estimate.  
 Cane-crushing season in Pakistan begins in November and
ends in March.  
 Pakistan’s government last month decided to allow duty-free
imports of raw sugar by the private sector. It will announce the
actual quantity in December.  
 The country has completed its purchases of 1.2 million tons
of white sugar for 2009-2010, according to the Trading Corp. of
Pakistan.
