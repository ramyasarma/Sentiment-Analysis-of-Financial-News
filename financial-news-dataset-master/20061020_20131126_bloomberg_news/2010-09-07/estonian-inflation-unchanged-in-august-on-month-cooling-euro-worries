             Estonian  inflation  was unchanged in
August from the previous month, reducing concerns that
businesses may try to raise prices ahead of euro adoption in
January.  
 The inflation rate was 2.9 percent, the Tallinn-based
statistics office said on its website today. The median estimate
of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 3 percent. In the
month, prices were unchanged.  
 Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  and Justice Minister  Rein Lang 
last month urged consumers to remain vigilant to prevent price
increases by businesses during the currency changeover or in the
preceding months. The central bank of the Baltic nation, due to
become the third east European nation to adopt the euro in
January, has warned that higher prices may hamper a recovery
from the second-deepest recession in the European Union in 2008
and 2009.  
 Annual inflation will accelerate to around 4 percent by
year-end, said Andrus Saalik, head of the Finance Ministry’s
economics department, on Aug. 25. Still, inflation will probably
slow at the beginning of the year due to a more stable outlook
for oil prices and a milder winter weather forecast.
