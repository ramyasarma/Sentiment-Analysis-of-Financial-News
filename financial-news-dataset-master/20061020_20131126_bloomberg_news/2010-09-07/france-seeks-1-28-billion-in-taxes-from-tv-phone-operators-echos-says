             France is seeking to raise 1 billion
euros in increased revenue from the television and
telecommunications industries, Les Echos reported, without
citing anyone.  
 Moves being considered to raise the money include charging
the full rate of value-added tax on ADSL television and mobile
phone packages which include TV, Les Echos said. Taxes on
‘triple-play’ offers are set to increase, according to the
newspaper.
