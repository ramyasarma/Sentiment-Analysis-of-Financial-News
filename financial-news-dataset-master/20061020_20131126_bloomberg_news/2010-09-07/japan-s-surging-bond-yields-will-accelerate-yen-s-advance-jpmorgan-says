             Japan’s surging 10-year government
bond yields could accelerate gains in the yen by encouraging the
nation’s investors to bring back overseas earnings, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo.  
 The  yield  on 10-year debt has risen to as high as 1.195
percent this week, the most since June 22, on speculation Ichiro
Ozawa will wrest leadership of the ruling party from Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and increase spending. Ozawa, who controls
the Democratic Party of Japan’s largest faction, will challenge
Kan for leadership in a ballot on Sept. 14.  
 “If JGB yields start rallying, it could lead to yen
appreciation as it accelerates repatriation of overseas assets
held by Japanese investors,” JPMorgan analysts led by  Tohru Sasaki , head of Japan rates and foreign-exchange research, wrote
in a research note today.  
 The yen rose to 83.82 per dollar at 8:29 a.m. in London
from 84.21 in New York yesterday, after climbing to 83.60 on Aug.
24, the highest level since June 1995.  
 Japan’s currency may also strengthen as exporters buy the
yen, the JPMorgan analysts said, citing the Bank of Japan’s
Tankan survey released on July 1. Japanese large manufacturers
expected the yen to average 90.16 per dollar in the six months
ending March 2011, according to the Tankan survey.  
 “Dollar-yen has never touched that level since late June
and has been on a constant downtrend,” the analysts wrote.
“This means that their hedging operation for the latter half of
fiscal 2010 could be significantly behind schedule. Under such a
situation, Japanese exporters may rush to buy yen if yen
appreciation further accelerates from the current level.”
