             Convertible Islamic debt sold by
Dana Gas PJSC and Aldar Properties PJSC are headed for the best
quarter in a year, a sign the Persian Gulf market is reviving.  
 Dana Gas’s 7.5 percent bonds due October 2012 yielded 10.77
percent yesterday, down from 13.6 percent on June 30, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The United Arab Emirates energy
company has operations in Egypt and Iraq. The yield on the 5.767
percent sukuk due November 2011 issued by Aldar, Abu Dhabi’s
biggest real-estate developer, was 7.30 percent, after falling
below 10 percent on Aug. 17.  
 The combination of plunging yields in developed markets and
a successful restructuring of state-owned Dubai World’s $14.4
billion of debt may spur more gains, said Holinger Asset
Management and DWS Investments GmbH, which hold Dana Gas and
Aldar sukuk respectively. Islamic debt is typically backed by
assets because the religion bars payment of interest.  
 “You still get nice yield pick-up in Dana Gas plus some
potential upside on the equity option,”  Tobias Bettkober , who
helps manage $400 million at Holinger in Zurich, said in an
interview yesterday. “In terms of yield, we suddenly got a flat
world, meaning 5 percent is the new high yield.”  
 U.S. non-investment grade bond yields averaged  8.49 percent 
yesterday, down from 9.18 percent on June 30, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. High Yield Master II Index. Two-
year Treasuries yielded 0.50 percent.  
 Restructuring Progress  
 The average yield on sukuk sold by Gulf Cooperation Council
borrowers fell 25 basis points last month to 6.52 percent,
according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai GCC US Dollar Sukuk Index . It
reached 8.76 percent on Dec. 11 after Dubai companies announced
plans to restructure debt in November.  
 Kuwait’s Investment Dar Co., owner of half of Aston Martin
Lagonda Ltd. was the first company from the region to default on
a sukuk, in April 2009. International Investment Group KSCC, a
Kuwaiti finance company, missed a payment this April on
convertible notes maturing 2012.  
 Bonds of Nakheel PJSC, a real estate unit of Dubai World,
rallied this year as it offered sukuk to pay contractors as part
of its debt restructuring plan. The yield on Nakheel’s 2.75
percent $750 million Islamic notes due in January fell 88 basis
points to 14.69 percent last week, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 “Bonds have been recovering nicely post Nakheel
restructuring,”  Skander Chabbi , who manages 3.7 billion euros
($4.8 billion) of  bonds  at DWS Investments in Frankfurt, said in
a Sept. 1 interview.  
 Best Quarter  
 Sukuk returned 1.4 percent last month, according to the
 HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index , while debt in
developing nations gained 2.4 percent,  EMBI Global Diversified
Index  showed. The spread between the  average  yield for sukuk and
the London interbank offered rate narrowed 16 basis points to
385 in August. It was at 377 basis points yesterday.  
 Global sukuk sales fell 12 percent from a year earlier to
$10.3 billion so far in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gulf issuance dropped 24 percent to $2.47 billion.
Sales of Islamic and non-Islamic dollar-denominated convertible
debt in the Gulf jumped 56 percent to $3.86 billion this year,
versus $1.66 billion in all of 2009, the data show.  
 Dana Gas  
 Bonds of Sharjah-based  Dana Gas  returned 8 percent since
June 30, the most since the end of last September, even though
the company’s share price is below the conversion price of the
securities.  
 Investors may exchange $10,000 face value of Dana Gas sukuk
for 19,076.68 shares in the company, or a conversion price of
1.926 dirhams each. The  stock  has risen 23 percent this quarter
to 0.81 dirham, trimming 2010’s decline to 4.7 percent.  
 Returns on some Gulf debt “are relatively attractive given
the implosion in the U.S. and Europe bond yields,” Bettkober
said. “Dana Gas, for one, is backed by oil and gas assets.”  
 The company, which discovered its fourth gas field this
year in the Nile Delta, is “ undervalued ” and may triple in two
years, depending on success in Kurdistan and Iran operations,
said  Bobby Sarkar , an analyst at NBK Capital in Kuwait.  
 Aldar’s convertible sukuk gained 4 percent since June 30.
While bondholders are unlikely to convert with its stock at 2.37
dirhams versus a conversion price of 5.69 dirhams, investors are
banking on government support for full redemption at maturity.
The company is 19.2 percent-owned by state-backed investor
Mubadala Development Co.  
 “The chances that Aldar will honor its debt commitments is
100 percent,”  Majed Azzam , a real-estate analyst at HC
Securities in Dubai, said in a Sept. 2 phone interview. “The
form of government support is uncertain. Investors are concerned
about potential equity dilution.”
