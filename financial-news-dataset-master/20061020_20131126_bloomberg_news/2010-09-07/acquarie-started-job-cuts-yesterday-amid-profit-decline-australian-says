             Macquarie Group Ltd.  started cutting
jobs late yesterday, the same day it said first-half profit
would fall 25 percent, the Australian newspaper  reported .  
 Several workers were made redundant today, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified fund managers. Macquarie told the
newspaper that comments on employee numbers are made only when
the bank reports full-year results.  
 Paula Hannaford , a spokeswoman for Macquarie in Sydney,
didn’t immediately reply to a message left on her mobile phone.  
 Australia’s biggest investment bank said yesterday that
profit in the six months to Sept. 30 will fall about 25 percent
from a year earlier, when it posted net income of A$479 million
($439 million). “Weak” markets are weighing on the bank’s
biggest businesses, the bank said.
