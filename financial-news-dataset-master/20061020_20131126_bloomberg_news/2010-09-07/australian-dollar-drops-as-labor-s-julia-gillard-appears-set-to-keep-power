             The Australian dollar fell after
Prime Minister Julia Gillard won the backing of a key
independent lawmaker, making it likely she will retain
government and pursue a tax on mining companies.  
 The Australian currency traded at 91.29 U.S. cents as of
3:11 p.m., from 91.46 cents before independent member of
parliament Tony Windsor said he will back Gillard’s Labor Party.
