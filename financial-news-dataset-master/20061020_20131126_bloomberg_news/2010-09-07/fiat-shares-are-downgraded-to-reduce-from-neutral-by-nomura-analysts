             Fiat SpA  was downgraded to
“reduce” from “neutral” at Nomura International Plc, which
expects the news flow for the Italian carmaker to “remain
negative over the next few months.”  
 “The current battle with unions and continued decrease in
market share are likely to weigh on the share price,” the
brokerage said in a note today.
