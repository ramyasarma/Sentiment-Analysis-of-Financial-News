             South Africa should consider
developing a mechanism to ensure that the windfalls from boom
times in the mining industry are shared more equitably by the
nation, said Joel Netshitenzhe, a member of the country’s
National Planning Commission, in a speech in Johannesburg.  
 South Africa’s current mining policy is suffering from a
lack of “strategic coherence” and black economic empowerment
in the industry needs to be accelerated, said Netshitenzhe, who
was speaking today in his role as executive director of the
Mapungubwe Institute of Strategic Reflection, a research
institute.
