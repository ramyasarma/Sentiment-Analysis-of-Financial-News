Strategist  Brian Belski  cut his 2010 and 2011 estimates for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, becoming at least the third
strategist in two weeks to reduce his outlook on U.S. stocks.  
 The benchmark for American equities may end the year at
1,225, Belski said, a gain of 11 percent in the next four months
from its Sept. 3 close. He had earlier predicted an advance to
1,300. Birinyi Associates Inc.’s  Laszlo Birinyi  lowered his 2010
projection to 1,225 from 1,325 on Aug. 26, and  Barry Knapp , of
Barclays Plc, trimmed his estimate to 1,120 from 1,210 on Aug.
27.  
 “We have to be realistic and acknowledge that the pace of
recent economic data has been weaker than we would have
expected,” Belski said in a research note. “The deceleration
of important economic indicators recently cannot be ignored.”  
 The S&P 500 has tumbled 9.3 percent since April 23 after
Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. economic reports ranging from home
sales to employment raised concern the economy may fall into a
recession. Oppenheimer predicts the index may rally through the
rest of 2010 as rising corporate  profits  lead investors back to
stocks.  
 The average S&P 500 forecast from 12 Wall Street
strategists tracked by Bloomberg shows the index may gain 9
percent and finish 2010 at 1,204. That’s down from a previous
estimate of 1,242 at the beginning of August.  
 Belski, who is based in New York, also cut his 2011
estimate for the  S&P 500  to 1,300 from 1,350. He maintained his
earnings forecasts for the index at $78.50 a share for 2010 and
$84.50 a share for 2011.
