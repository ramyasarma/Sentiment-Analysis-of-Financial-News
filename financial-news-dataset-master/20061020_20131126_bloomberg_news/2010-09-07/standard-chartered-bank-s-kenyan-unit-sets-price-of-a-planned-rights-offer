             Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd.,
the local unit of Standard Chartered Plc., will sell 15.1
million shares at 165.45 shillings ($2.04) each through a rights
offer, an adviser on the sale said.  
 The offer opened today and will close Sept. 28, and the new
shares will begin trading on the Nairobi stock exchange on Oct.
29,  Wanjiku Mugane , chief executive of Nairobi-based First
Africa Capital Ltd., told reporters in the city today.  
 Part of the 2.5 billion shillings raised from the sale will

1.88 billion-shillings acquisition on May 28, he said.  
 “The business is a successful pan-African and securities

in eight African markets,” he said. Custody business will be
