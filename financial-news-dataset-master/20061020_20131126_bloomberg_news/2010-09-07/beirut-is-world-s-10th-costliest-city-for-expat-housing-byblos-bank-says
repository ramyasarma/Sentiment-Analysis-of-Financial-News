             Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, is the
10th most expensive rental city in the world for expatriate
housing in 2010, compared with its rank of 28 last year,  Byblos
Bank SAL  said.  
 The city is ahead of Paris, Abu Dhabi, Amsterdam, Geneva
and Rio de Janeiro and behind Singapore, Osaka, New York City,
Moscow, Hong Kong and London, the bank said in an e-mailed
report, citing a survey by  EuroCost International .  
 Tokyo remains the most expensive city in the world for
expatriates.  
 Beirut is the most expensive city in the Middle East this
year, because of the increase in rental prices, the bank
reported, citing the survey, which evaluated the average rental
cost of two- and three-bedroom apartments for expatriates.
