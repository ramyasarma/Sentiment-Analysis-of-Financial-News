             Shinsei Bank Ltd. , the Japanese
lender partly owned by J.  Christopher Flowers , appointed
 David Morgan , a managing director at the U.S. buyout firm, as a
senior adviser.  
 Morgan, 63, took the position Sept. 2,  Eiji Otaka , a
spokesman for Shinsei, said today by telephone from Tokyo.
Morgan now oversees JC Flowers & Co. LLC’s Europe and Asia-
Pacific operations after serving as chief executive officer at
Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp. until 2008.  
 Shinsei’s board of directors appointed Morgan, an 18 year
Westpac veteran, to advise the Japanese bank as it rebuilds its
management after a failed merger with local rival  Aozora Bank
Ltd.  Shinsei shares have  tumbled  36 percent since the merger
talks broke down on May 14.  
 Masamoto Yashiro , former chief executive officer,  Rahul Gupta , former chief financial officer, and several Shinsei
managing directors have resigned to take responsibility for two
straight years of losses.
