             Fondul Proprietatea SA, the Romanian
property restitution fund, will sell shares on the  Bucharest
Stock Exchange  early next year and hold an initial public
offering on the London Stock Exchange by the end of 2011,  Mark Mobius  said.  
 “For the local listing, new shares are not necessary, for
a London listing in order to be successful you have to offer
shares because otherwise brokers would not be interested,”
Mobius said in an interview in Bucharest yesterday.  
 Fondul Proprietatea’s shareholders approved the share sale
and appointed Mobius’ Franklin Templeton Investment Management
Ltd. as manager of the fund, whose value was 2.7 billion euros
($3.5 billion) as of 2009. The fund on Aug. 25 picked a group of
three banks led by Raiffeisen Capital & Investment to manage its
share sale, after a new valuation is carried out and announced
this month, according to Mobius.  
 “The net asset value will be announced and then investors
will say: ‘OK, that’s the value of the fund and people will
begin to compare and then you will see trading taking place,’ ”
Mobius said. “Hopefully the price will come up to the net asset
value, but there is no guarantee.”  
 The Bucharest share sale will take place “at the beginning
of next year once all the processes have been done,” said
Mobius, who oversees about $34 billion and whose biggest are in
Brazil, China, India, Thailand and Russia.  
 Fondul Stakes  
 Fondul Proprietatea owns stakes in 84 companies, including
 Petrom SA , Romania’s largest oil company,  Transelectrica SA ,
 Transgaz SA  and atomic power company Nuclearelectrica SA,
according to the fund’s website. The fund was set up to
compensate Romanians for property confiscated under communism.  
 Mobius also said Franklin Templeton is interested in buying
Fondul Proprietatea after the share sale.  
 “We would like to buy Fondul, but we didn’t want to do
that now because we thought it would be unfair, so we want to
wait until it is listed and then our fund managers all over the
world can look at it and say: ‘OK, it’s a good price we’ll buy
it,’ ” Mobius said.
