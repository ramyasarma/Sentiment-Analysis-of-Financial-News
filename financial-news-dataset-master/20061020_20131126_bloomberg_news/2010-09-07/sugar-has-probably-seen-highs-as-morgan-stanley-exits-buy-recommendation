             Raw sugar has probably seen its
highs for now, Morgan Stanley said.  
 Hot weather in Russia has increased the sucrose content by
10 percent to 20 percent, Morgan Stanley analyst Hussein
Allidina wrote in a report today. “Absent production
disruptions, we see little in the way of catalysts to propel
front-month prices further from current levels,” he wrote.
Morgan Stanley is exiting its recommendation to buy raw sugar
for March delivery, according to the report. The buy
recommendation was initiated on March 25, 2009, Morgan Stanley
said.
