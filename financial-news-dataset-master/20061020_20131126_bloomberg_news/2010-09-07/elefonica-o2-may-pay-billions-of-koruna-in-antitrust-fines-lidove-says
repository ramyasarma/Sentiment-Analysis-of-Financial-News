             Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS is
under investigation by the Czech anti-monopoly office and may
end up paying billions of koruna in fines for engaging in unfair
competition,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing  Kristian Chalupa ,
the watchdog’s spokesman.  
 The office suspects O2 of practising so-called “margin
squeeze” from 2006 to 2008, misusing its dominant position in
the Czech market, the newspaper said.
