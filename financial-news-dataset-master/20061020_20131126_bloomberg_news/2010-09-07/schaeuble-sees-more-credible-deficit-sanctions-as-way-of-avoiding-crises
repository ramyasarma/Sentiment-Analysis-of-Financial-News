             German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said Europe needs improved surveillance and “more
credible” sanctions for countries breaching the region’s
deficit rules.  
 “Better supervision, earlier intervention, more credible
sanctions and a limitation of instruments would improve chances
to avoid future crises,” Schaeuble said in an interview with
German television ZDF. “We will try to nail” a financial
transaction tax, he added.
