             The Australian dollar extended
declines after Prime Minister Julia Gillard won the backing of
key independent lawmakers, allowing her Labor Party to retain
government and pursue a tax on mining companies.  
 The Australian currency slid to 91.26 U.S. cents as of
3:34 p.m. in Sydney, from 91.76 cents yesterday in New York.
