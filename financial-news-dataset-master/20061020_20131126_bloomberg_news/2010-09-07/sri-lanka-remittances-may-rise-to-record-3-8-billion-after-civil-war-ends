             Remittances sent home by Sri Lankan
nationals overseas may rise to a record $3.8 billion in 2010, a
central bank official said, adding that policy makers will
ensure stability of the currency as the flows increase.  
 “We are still getting sustained inflows from the Middle
East and people are sending more money to their families in the
north and east since the war ended,” Swarna Gunaratne, acting
director of the  central bank ’s economic research department,
said in a telephone interview today.  
 Sri Lankan troops defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam in 2009, freeing areas in the north and east which were
controlled by the separatists for 26 years. The Central Bank of
Sri Lanka would “purchase excess foreign exchange in the
market” and keep the Sri Lankan rupee stable, Gunaratne said.  
 Spending on imports will exhaust some dollar inflows and
prevent a sharp gain in the rupee, she said.  
 The Sri Lankan rupee, which has climbed about 2.3 percent
since the war ended, was at 112.55 to the dollar at 1:20 p.m. in
Colombo, according to Bloomberg data.
