             Posco , JFE Holdings Inc. and other
Asian steelmakers advanced after steel prices in China, the
biggest consumer of the metal, jumped amid production cuts.  
 Benchmark hot-rolled coil  prices  in China rose 3.5 percent
yesterday to the highest in almost four months as steelmakers in
Hebei province shut  mills  after the local government limited
electricity supply to reach power efficiency targets.  
 As much as 25 million metric tons of annual steel capacity
may be suspended as local governments seek to meet power targets,
Credit Suisse Group AG said last week. Hebei province, the
biggest steel producer in the country, will demand that Tangshan
Iron & Steel Group, Shougang Corp., and other steelmakers curb
output to meet energy targets, according to the Tangshan city
government  website.   
 “We believe there are more targeted measures ahead to
conserve energy consumption and that both steel prices and
equities have further upside from here,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst  Nathan M. Zibilich  said in a note today. China has cut
energy consumption per unit GDP by 15.6 percent between 2006 to
2010, below its target of a 20 percent reduction, he said.  
 Posco advanced 4.5 percent, the biggest gain since June 21,
to close at 504,000 won in Seoul. JFE, Japan’s second-biggest
steelmaker, gained 2.4 percent to 2,695 yen in Tokyo. Maanshan
Iron & Steel Co. surged 10 percent, the daily limit, to 3.94
yuan in Shanghai trading.  
 Hebei Curbs  
 “Investors seem to be betting that Korean mills will
benefit from output curbs in China’s Hebei province, which drove
prices in China higher,” Park Kee Hyun, an analyst at Tong Yang
Securities Inc., said by phone.  
 Tangshan Steel Group, Tangshan Guofeng Iron & Steel Co.,
Hebei Jinxi Iron & Steel Co. and 27 other mills in Tangshan city
should cut production by a combined 47 percent each month for
the rest of the year from the monthly levels of January-to-July,
the  Economic Information Daily  said today. The paper, an
affiliate of the official Xinhua News Agency, citied a
government document.  
 “Our new plant in Hebei must meet the environmental
standards set by the government,”  Wu Jianxin , a spokesman of
Shougang, said by phone from Beijing. “It’s facing production
cuts probably because it’s a large producer.”  
 Fu Guanghua, a vice president of privately owned Tangshan
Guofeng, said the company may have to cut production at furnaces
as well as its rolling mills. Wang Weigang, a spokesman of Hebei
Steel, didn’t answer calls seeking comment.
