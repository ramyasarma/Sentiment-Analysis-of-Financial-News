             The Swedish Debt Office will unwind
a 50 billion kronor ($6.9 billion) bet on the currency against
the euro, taking as much as a year to sell its position, the
Stockholm-based agency said today in a statement.  
 "We believe that the Swedish krona could appreciate further
from these levels, though we consider the current levels to be 
relatively normal," Riksgaelden said. "We're not targeting a 
best possible exchange rate. The position will be closed on 
many different levels."
