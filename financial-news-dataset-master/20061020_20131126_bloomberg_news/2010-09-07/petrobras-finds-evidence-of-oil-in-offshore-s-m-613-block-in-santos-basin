             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, found evidence of oil in an
offshore well in Brazil’s Santos basin, the Brazilian petroleum
regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at well 1BRSA841SPS in the S-M-613
block at a water depth of 104 meters (341 feet), the National
Petroleum Agency said on its website. Rio de Janeiro-based
Petrobras hasn’t determined if the find can be developed
commercially.
