             BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto
Group are set to pay higher taxes in Australia after  Julia Gillard ’s Labor party today won support to form a minority
government, following the closest election in 70 years.  
 Prime Minister Gillard clinched a deal with two independent
lawmakers  Rob Oakeshott  and  Tony Windsor , paving the way for her
to form a government. The Australian dollar extended losses as
it became clear she would retain power.  
 BHP, Rio and rival iron ore and coal producers will pay
A$10.5 billion ($9.6 billion) more in tax in the first two years
of the 30 percent levy proposed by Gillard, 48. Oakeshott today
said he wants an “open public discussion” on the mining levy
as part of a broader debate on tax reform.  
 “At this stage, it only includes coal and iron ore but who
knows if the scope changes or the rates change,”  Peter Chilton ,
a fund manager at Constellation Capital Management Ltd., who
holds shares in both BHP and Rio, said by phone from Sydney. The
issue of a possible increase to the tax rate casts “a bit more
doubt” on the mining sector, he said.  
 BHP dropped 0.3 percent to A$38.44 at 4:10 p.m. Sydney time
close on the Australian stock exchange. Rio  declined  0.9 percent
to A$74.35.  
 Tony Abbott , 52, leader of the Liberal-National coalition,
had pledged to scrap the tax. Opposition to the tax in the
nation’s mining states wasn’t enough to topple Gillard, who
wants the money to fund tax breaks for small businesses and
roads, rail links and ports.  
 “Let’s have a meaty debate about tax reform in this
country,” Oakeshott said. “That dialogue is important so we
can then make some substantial decisions on what is one of the
core issues for this country.”
