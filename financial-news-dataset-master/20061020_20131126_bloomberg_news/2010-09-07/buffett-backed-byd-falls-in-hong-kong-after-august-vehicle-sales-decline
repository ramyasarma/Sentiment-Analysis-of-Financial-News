             BYD Co. , the Chinese automaker
backed by  Warren Buffett , fell the most in a week after saying
its sales in August declined.  
 BYD dropped as much as 3.1 percent to HK$47.75 and traded
at HK$48.05 as of 12:29 p.m. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  was
little changed.  
 The carmaker’s sales in China fell 19 percent from a year
earlier to 31,069 vehicles last month, the Shenzhen-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 BYD, 10 percent owned by Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., cut its full-year vehicle sales target
by 25 percent to 600,000 units on Aug. 4.
