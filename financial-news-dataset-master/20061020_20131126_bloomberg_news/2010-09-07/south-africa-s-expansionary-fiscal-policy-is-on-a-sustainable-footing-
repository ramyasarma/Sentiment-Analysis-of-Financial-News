             South Africa’s expansionary fiscal
policy is on a “sustainable footing,” Deputy Finance Minister
Nhlanhla Nene said.  
 The budget deficit, which is forecast to reach 6.2 percent
of gross domestic product this year, has “given the economy
much needed support” after last year’s recession, Nene said in
a speech hosted by the Banking Association of South Africa in
Johannesburg today.
