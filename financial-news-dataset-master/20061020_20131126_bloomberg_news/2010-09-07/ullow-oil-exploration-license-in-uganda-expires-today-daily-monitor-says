             Uganda’s government could take back
an exploration license for an oil field in the west of the
country from  Tullow Oil Plc  if it’s not renewed before it
expires later today, the  Daily Monitor  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 The license is for Block 1 in western Uganda, where some of
the country’s largest oil finds have been made, the Kampala-
based newspaper said.  
 Tullow, which is involved in a tax dispute with the Ugandan
government, is in talks with officials “on a wide range of
issues” and is confident “an amicable solution” will be
reached, the newspaper said, citing Tullow spokesman Jimmy
Kiberu.
