             South Africa must consider using
nuclear fuel to meet the country’s power needs, Energy Minister
Dipuo Peters said.  
 It would be more cost-effective for the nation to consider
a series of nuclear power plants rather than just one, Peters
said in a speech in Johannesburg today. Nuclear power currently
supplies about 4 percent of South Africa’s energy needs, she
said.
