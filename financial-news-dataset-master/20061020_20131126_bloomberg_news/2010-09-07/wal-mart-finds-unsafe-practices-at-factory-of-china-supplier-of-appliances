             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, has found unsafe work practices in a mainland
China factory operated by  Elec-Tech International Co. , which
supplies the chain with home appliances.  
 Elec-Tech will decommission hazardous machines until the
installation of improved safety features such as infrared
detectors,  Kevin Gardner , a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart, said by e-mail today, confirming details in an
earlier report in the South China Morning Post.  
 Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior , a Hong
Kong-based organization that lobbies companies on labor
conditions, last month  said  safety shortcomings at Elec-Tech led
to unsafe work practices and injuries to workers. The southern
China-based manufacturer produces appliances such as coffee
makers, blenders and food processors.  
 Wal-Mart  made two unannounced audits at Elec-Tech’s plant
in Zhuhai and identified 55 incidents of staff injuries, the
South China Morning Post reported. Gardner said the details in
the report were accurate.  
 Calls to  Elec-Tech ’s headquarters in Zhuhai in the southern
Chinese province of Guangdong weren’t answered.  
 Elec-Tech  declined 1.4 percent to 20.03 yuan at the 11:30
a.m. trading break in Shenzhen, paring its  gain this year  to 17
percent.
