             Taiko Pharmaceutical Co. , a Japanese
maker of antiseptics, rose the most since listing on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange after several types of drug-resistant bacteria
were reportedly found in the country.  
 The stock surged 29 percent to 1,336 yen as of 1:26 p.m. on
the exchange, the biggest  gain  since March 2009. Taiko has
fallen 30 percent this year, compared with 7.8 percent decline
in the benchmark Topix index.  
 Forty-six patients have been infected with a drug-resistant
bacterium called Acinetobacter at Tokyo’s Teikyo University
Hospital over the past year, the Yomiuri newspaper reported
today. The report also said bacteria with the NDM-1 gene,
resistant to almost all antibiotics, was identified for the
first time in Japan yesterday in a patient at Dokkyo Medical
University Hospital, north of Tokyo.  
 “The stock’s surge may be attributed to the new
bacterium,” said  Hitoshi Ohnishi , an analyst at Cosmo
Securities Co., who has a “neutral plus” rating on Osaka-based
Taiko. “I don’t know how effective their products are, but the
company has an established reputation in the antibacterial
business.”
