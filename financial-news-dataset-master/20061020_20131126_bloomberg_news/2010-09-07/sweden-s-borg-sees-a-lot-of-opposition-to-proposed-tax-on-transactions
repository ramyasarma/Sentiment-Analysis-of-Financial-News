             Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
said there is “a lot of opposition” among his European
colleagues to a proposed tax on financial transactions.   
 “It will make the markets less liquid,” Borg said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television today in Brussels. “We
should go for a banking levy instead of a transaction tax.”
