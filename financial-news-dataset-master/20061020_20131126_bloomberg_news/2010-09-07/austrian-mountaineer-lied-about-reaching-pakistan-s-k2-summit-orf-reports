             Austrian mountaineer Christian
Stangl lied about climbing the summit of Pakistan’s K2, Austrian
public broadcaster ORF reported, citing Stangl.  
 The photo showing Stangl on the summit was forged, ORF
television said. The photo was taken about 1,000 meters (3,280
feet) under the peak, the broadcaster said.   
 Stangl said that due to stress and fear of failure, he only
imagined reaching the summit, ORF said. He had been in a trance-
like state, ORF cited Stangl as saying.
