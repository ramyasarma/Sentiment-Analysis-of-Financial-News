             Electricity of Vietnam plans to
raise as much as $1 billion from an overseas bond sale to fund
new power projects, according to Mai Quoc Hoi, head of finance
and accounting at the state-owned utility.  
 Hanoi-based EVN, as the company is known, is in talks with
banks for advice as it seeks to get a credit rating this month
ahead of a sale “at the end of the year or in early 2011,” Hoi
said in a telephone interview today. The government has approved
its plan, he said.  
 EVN is trying to raise money to build power plants as the
government forecasts a shortage of almost 1 billion kilowatt-
hours this year. Power demand may rise as much as 18 percent as
the economy expands by 6.7 percent this year and 7.5 percent in
2011, according to government estimates.
