             The European Union asked Hungary to
modify a law that cut the salary of Central Bank President
 Andras Simor ,  Index  reported, citing a letter from  Marco Buti ,
head of the European Commission’s economics department.  
 The department believes the law violates EU rules on
central bank independence and asked the government to respond by
Oct. 1, Index reported. If Hungary doesn’t alter the law, the
department will ask the European Commission to take action,
which may result in a lawsuit at the European Court of Justice,
the news website said, citing an unidentified person.  
 Hungary’s  Economy Ministry  said yesterday that the decision
to cap central bankers’ pay at a 2 million forint ($8,920) a
month was part of a wider pay ceiling for public workers and can
be “reconciled” with central bank independence, Index
reported, citing a ministry statement.  
 Simor earned 8.34 million forint a month before the law
took effect Sept. 1.
