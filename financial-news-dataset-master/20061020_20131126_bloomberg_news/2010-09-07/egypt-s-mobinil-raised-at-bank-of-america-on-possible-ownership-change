             Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services ,
the country’s largest mobile-network operator by subscribers,
was raised at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which cited a
possible change in the “strategic” ownership of the company.  
 Mobinil was raised to “buy” from “neutral” and its 12-
month share-price estimate to 220 Egyptian pounds from 180
pounds, Dubai-based analyst  Stephen Pettyfer  wrote in a report
today.  
 A change of control at its parent  Orascom Telecom Holding
SAE  “would likely lead to a sale of the 20 percent directly
owned Mobinil stake,” according to the report. “While we are
unclear whether the regulator would view this as a change of
control, thus warranting a minority bid, we consider it likely
that a transaction would provide valuation support.”  
 Mobinil shares rose 1.3 percent to 185.96 pounds at the
1:30 p.m. close in Cairo yesterday.
