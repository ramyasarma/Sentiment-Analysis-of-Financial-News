             Ian Burgess  and  Alfredo Mattera , who
headed the credit unit at London-based asset manager Polygon,
are seeking $100 million for a distressed debt fund.  
 Warwick Capital Partners LLP’s European Special Situations
and Distressed Credit Fund will bet the world’s riskiest
borrowers could struggle to refinance should the global economy
slow, according to Burgess. Warwick raised $100 million of
capital in May and the new fundraising is expected to be
completed by Nov. 1, he said.  
 Distressed debt funds had inflows of $2.6 billion during
the first half of the year, compared with more than $10 billion
of outflows in the previous two years, according Chicago-based
 Hedge Fund Research . Moody’s Investors Service forecasts the
global corporate default rate will fall to 2.6 percent by year-
end, from as high as 13.5 percent in November 2009.  
 “There are a lot of businesses in Europe that are
overleveraged,” Burgess said in an interview in London.
“Combine this with a wave of refinancing over the coming years,
a weak economic and sovereign backdrop, and there are sure to be
a lot of restructurings over the next one to three years.”  
 Polygon closed its $3.7 billion Global Opportunities Fund
in October 2008 saying it would take until 2012 to return all
the cash to investors after running into trouble during the
financial crisis. The fund lost 48 percent of its value in 2008,
hurt by positions in convertible bonds, and has since returned
about 50 percent of assets to investors.  
 Debt is considered distressed when its price falls to less
than 70 percent of face value, or yields rise to at least 10
percentage points more than benchmark rates. Distressed debt
funds returned 11.87 percent on average this year, according to
 Eurekahedge Pte , a Singapore-based research firm. It earned
investors 34.8 percent in 2009, Eurekahedge data show.
