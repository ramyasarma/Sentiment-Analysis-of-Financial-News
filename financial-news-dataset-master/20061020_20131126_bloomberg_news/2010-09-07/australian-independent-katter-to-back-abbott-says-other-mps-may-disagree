             Australian independent lawmaker  Bob Katter  said he’ll support the coalition’s  Tony Abbott , putting
the opposition leader two seats short of the 76 he needs to form
government following the closest election in 70 years.  
 “I will be backing the coalition,” Katter told reporters
during an impromptu news conference in Canberra today. “I don’t
think my colleagues see it the way I see it.”  
 Fellow independents  Robert Oakeshott  and  Tony Windsor  will
hold a press conference at 3 p.m. local time, Windsor said in a
statement. The three so-called country independents have been
weighing which party to back after the Aug. 21 national election
failed to produce a majority for either Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s Labor Party or Abbott’s Liberal-National coalition.  
 “I made up my mind and now they have to make up their
mind,” Katter said.  
 Gillard needs the support of two of the three independents
after last week securing the backing of Greens Party member  Adam Bandt  and independent lawmaker  Andrew Wilkie . Abbott needs all
three to govern in the 150-member House of Representatives.
