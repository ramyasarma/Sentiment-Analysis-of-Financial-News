             Japanese stocks  fell for the first
time in five days as a stronger yen and lower oil prices
countered expectations President Barack Obama’s proposed
stimulus will boost the U.S. economy.  
 Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 70 percent
of its revenue abroad, fell 1.8 percent. The euro weakened
against the yen amid concern European banks will have to raise
capital. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest commodities trader,
slid 1.2 percent after oil prices dropped.  Clarion Co.  plunged
9.3 percent after Nikkei said the car audio maker will be
removed from the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  
 “Concern about Europe remains, so we’ll have to wait for
six months to one year before people take a bullish stance on
stocks,” said  Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee $2.2 billion at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Japanese stocks have
declined on concern the U.S. economy will slow, but investors’
pessimism is easing after Obama proposed a new stimulus plan.”  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.8 percent to 9,226 at
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.1 percent
earlier. The broader  Topix  index lost 0.5 percent to 834.92 with
about two stocks falling for every one that rose.  
 The Topix has declined 8 percent in 2010, compared with a
drop of 1 percent by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and a gain
of 2.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 14.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with 13.3 times for the S&P and 11.8 times for the
Stoxx.  
 Yen Strengthens  
 Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. Exchanges in
the U.S. were closed for the Labor Day holiday yesterday.  
 Nissan lost 1.8 percent to 669 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, slid 0.6 percent to 2,936 yen. Honda
Motor Co., which derives more than 80 percent of its sales
abroad, fell 1.4 percent to 2,815 yen, the heaviest drag on the
Topix.  
 The yen appreciated to 107.56 against the euro, compared
with 108.85 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday,
after the Wall Street Journal said European bank stress tests
published in July understated sovereign debt holdings at some
financial institutions. Against the dollar, the yen rose to
84.05 from 84.37 yesterday. The stronger yen reduces income at
Japanese companies when overseas revenue is converted into local
currency.  
 Nomura Securities Co. raised its forecast for the yen
against the dollar to 82.5 from an earlier target of 87.5,
citing global uncertainty and declining yields on U.S. debt,
according to a report dated yesterday.  
 Bridgestone Drops  
 Tiremakers including Bridgestone Corp. fell the most among
the Topix’s 33 industry groups. The pace of an earnings recovery
at Bridgestone, the world’s largest tiremaker, will moderate
because of rising raw material costs and the faltering pace of
recovery in automobile usage in the U.S., Deutsche Bank AG said
in a report.  
 Bridgestone  retreated 1.8 percent to 1,513 yen. Sumitomo
Rubber Industries Ltd. and Yokohama Rubber Co., Bridgestone’s
smaller rivals, declined at least 1.5 percent.  
 Mitsubishi fell 1.2 percent to 1,892 yen and was the third-
largest contributor to the Topix’s decline.  Mitsui & Co. ,
Japan’s second-biggest trading house by market value, dropped
1.2 percent to 1,128 yen. Sumitomo Corp., the No. 3, slid 1
percent to 1,009 yen.  
 Oil, Copper Rise  
 Crude oil for October delivery declined 1 percent to $73.89
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 2:19 p.m. in Tokyo. Copper for three-month
delivery on the London Metal Exchange slid as much as 0.3
percent today.  
 Steelmakers rose after  Obama  proposed spending at least $50
billion to fix roads, railways and runways, and to modernize the
air-traffic control system to help spur an economy that’s lost
jobs for three straight months.  
 “Expectations the economy will not fall into a double-dip
recession increased after Obama announced a stimulus plan for
the U.S.,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co.  
 Japan’s two largest steelmakers Nippon Steel Corp. and JFE
Holdings Inc. advanced 2.4 percent, the biggest gains in the
Nikkei 225. Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. rose 1 percent to 213
yen. Kobe Steel Ltd. gained 1.6 percent to 186 yen.  
 The nation’s top four steelmakers will likely raise their
profit forecasts as a drop in material prices cuts their costs,
the Nikkei newspaper reported. Steelmakers were also supported
by benchmark hot-rolled coil prices in China, which rose 3.5
percent yesterday as producers in Hebei province shut mills.  
 Clarion plunged 9.3 percent to 157 yen, the biggest slide
since September 2009, ahead of the company’s removal from the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average on Oct. 1. The gauge will add Nippon
Electric Glass Co. from Sept. 28 and Tokyo Tatemono Co. from Oct.
1, according to the report.  
 Nippon Electric Glass gained 1.4 percent to 1,080 yen and
Tokyo Tatemono jumped 3.2 percent to 319 yen.
