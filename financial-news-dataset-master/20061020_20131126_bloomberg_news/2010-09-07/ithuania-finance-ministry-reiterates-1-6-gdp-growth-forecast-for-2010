             Lithuanian  consumer prices  will
probably rise this year because of higher commodity and food
prices, the  Finance Ministry  said, reversing an earlier forecast
for deflation.  
 The inflation rate will average 1.1 percent this year,
compared with a May 13 forecast of 0.1 percent deflation, the
Vilnius-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
Consumer prices will average 1.8 percent next year. The
government reiterated its  economic growth  forecast of 1.6
percent for this year and 2.8 percent in 2011.  
 Inflation in the Baltic nation was the fastest in 10 months
in July at 1.9 percent. Lithuania, which maintains a fixed
exchange rate for the litai to the euro, has been using
deflation and wage cuts to restore competitiveness after a
credit-fueled boom led the European Union’s second-worst
recession last year.  
 Prices will accelerate on “a depreciating euro rate
against the dollar, higher global oil and food prices and also
changing compensation trends,” the ministry said. The inflation
rate is expected to jump to 2.5 percent by the end of the year,
it said.  
 Wages rose 1.2 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months for the first time since 2008 as the
economy began to recover and emigration trimmed the workforce.  
 Economic growth may accelerate to between 4 percent and 5
percent in the second half this year on export growth and
“stabilization of domestic demand,” the ministry said.  
 Output returned to growth last quarter, driven by foreign
sales and industrial production. Gross domestic product advanced
1.3 percent from a year ago after a 2.8 percent contraction in
the first quarter.  
 Unemployment will probably accelerate to 17.9 percent this
year before slowing to 16.2 percent in 2011.
