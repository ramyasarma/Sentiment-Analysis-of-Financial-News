             Andean Resources Ltd. , which agreed
to a takeover from  Goldcorp Inc.  after getting an offer from
 Eldorado Gold Corp ., said it hasn’t received other proposals and
will study any fresh bid.  
 “If there is a better bid that comes in, we are going to
evaluate it,” Andean Chief Executive Officer  Wayne Hubert  said
today in interview from Salt Lake City, adding that between six
and eight companies have accessed a data room that was closed
last week after two years. “At this point, we think the
GoldCorp bid is the best one.”  
 Goldcorp’s C$3.6 billion ($3.5 billion) bid last week
trumped an offer from Eldorado to gain control of Andean’s Cerro
Negro project in Argentina, which may produce 285,000 ounces of
gold a year from as early as 2012. Andean’s Toronto-traded
shares on Sept. 3 closed 7.4 percent higher than Goldcorp’s bid,
signaling investors expect a higher offer.  
 “There is a lot of potential in the project and they are
betting on something higher,” Hubert said.  
 Perth-based Andean’s Canadian stock rose 45 percent to
C$6.98 on Sept. 3. Goldcorp is offering 0.14 of a share for each
Andean stock, or cash payment of C$6.50 a share up to a maximum
of C$1 billion. Andean’s Sydney-traded stock has risen 44
percent since the day before Goldcorp’s bid. It traded at A$7.02
at 2:03 Sydney time.
