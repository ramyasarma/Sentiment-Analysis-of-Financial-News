             Banks including Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA and UniCredit SpA rejected a proposal by  Severstal OAO 
Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Mordashov  to wipe out some of
Italian unit Lucchini SpA’s debt, daily Il  Messaggero  said.  
 Lucchini owes creditors 770 million euros ($986 million).
Mordashov plans to inject 50 million euros into the unit through
a capital increase, Messaggero reported, without saying where it
got the information.
