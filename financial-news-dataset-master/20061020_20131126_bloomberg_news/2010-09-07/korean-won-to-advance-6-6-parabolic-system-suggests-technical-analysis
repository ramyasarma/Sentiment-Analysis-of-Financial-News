             South Korea’s won may strengthen 6.6
percent over the next three months, Okasan Securities Co. said,
citing a technical indicator known as the Parabolic System.  
 The currency is likely to reach 1,155.75 per dollar in
about a week, a level last recorded on Aug. 9,  Tsutomu Soma , a
Tokyo-based bond and currency dealer at Okasan, said in an
interview today. An exchange rate of 1,102.85 is projected in
three months, a level not seen since April 26. Won declines have
halted four times just above the 1,200 area since July, another
indication the Asian currency will strengthen, Soma added.  
 “After a break of an Aug. 9 high area, there won’t be any
major resistance for the won,” Soma said. “The won is still on
a long-term trend of appreciation.”  
 The won dropped 0.5 percent to 1,175.70 per dollar as of
1:03 p.m. in Seoul, the first decline in a week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It will end the year at 1,130,
according to the median forecast of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 The Parabolic System is represented by a series of dots on
a chart, also known as a stop-and-reversal-point. When a
currency is below the SAR point, in this case the dollar against
the won, the chart indicates the greenback will weaken.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
