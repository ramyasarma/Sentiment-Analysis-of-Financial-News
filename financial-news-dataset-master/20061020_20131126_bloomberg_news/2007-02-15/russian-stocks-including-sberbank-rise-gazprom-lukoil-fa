             Russian stocks including OAO
Sberbank rose. The nation's largest bank climbed to a three-week
high after the rose after the government said it sold the shares
above the market price.  
 OAO Gazprom and OAO Lukoil led declines by energy companies
after  oil prices  fell for second day. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel
followed the price of the metal higher.  
 The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose for a third day,
adding 0.3 percent to 1894.92. The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost
0.13 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1690.84.  
 Sberbank climbed 1.6 percent to 93,541 rubles, adding to
yesterday's 1.6 percent advance.  
 The Russian Federal Property Fund last week sold 2,176
shares for 91,100 rubles each to a Moscow-based  investment
company  in an auction, the fund said yesterday. Sberbank will
sell as many as 3.5 million new shares at a price to be set by
the board after Feb. 19.  
 ``If this was a bigger stake, then this could have been
seen as a proxy for the secondary placement,'' said Natalia Orlova, a banking analyst at  Alfa Bank .  
 Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, fell 0.9 percent
to 278.79. Lukoil shares dropped 1.7 percent to 2,100.54 rubles.  
 Crude oil for March delivery fell 1.8 percent to $56.93
today after trading began on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
The contract also lost 1.8 percent yesterday.  
 Norilsk, the world's largest producer of nickel, rose 0.9
percent to $181.10. Nickel climbed for a third day in London and
traded near a record as speculation grew that dwindling
stockpiles will lead to shortages. Nickel for three-month
delivery climbed 3.3 percent to $38,750 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange.  
 OAO Severstal rose 0.6 percent to 343.52 rubles, a three-
month high. The steelmaker will join Morgan Stanley Capital
International's  emerging markets  index series, MSCI Barra said
yesterday. The stock climbed 4.3 percent yesterday, its biggest
gain in three weeks.
