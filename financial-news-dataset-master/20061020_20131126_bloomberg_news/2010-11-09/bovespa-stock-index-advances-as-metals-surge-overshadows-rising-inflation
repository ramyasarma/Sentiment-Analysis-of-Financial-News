The Bovespa stock index advanced for
the sixth time in seven days as a surge in metals prices
overshadowed quickening Brazilian inflation.  Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, climbed for
a second session after a jump in Chinese auto sales boosted the
price of copper, a bellwether for global growth. Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, gained as
oil prices jumped to a two-year high.  The Bovespa stock index rose 0.5 percent to 72,987.82 at
8:06 a.m. New York time. Fifty-one stocks gained on the index
while 10 fell. The real strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.6923 per
U.S. dollar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
