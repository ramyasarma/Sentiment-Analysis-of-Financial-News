Raw sugar rose for a 10th straight
session, reaching a 29-year high on concern that India may cap
exports to boost domestic supplies after a smaller-than-expected
cane harvest. Cocoa, coffee and orange juice gained.  India, the world’s second-biggest sugar producer, may
export 1.5 million to 2 million metric tons of the sweetener,
New York-based Commodore Research & Consultancy said yesterday.
Earlier this year it predicted 3.5 million tons. Flooding in the
state of Uttar Pradesh triggered cuts to forecasts, Commodore
said.  “Further heavy rains in India are causing analysts to
restrict upward production estimates,”  Michael McDougall , a
senior vice president at Newedge USA, said in a note e-mailed
today. “There is a finite amount of time for the Indian harvest
to take place.”  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery added 1.06 cents, or
3.3 percent, to 32.94 cents a pound at 11:27 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 33.32 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Jan. 7, 1981.
Before today, the commodity gained 18 percent this year.  Raw sugar will “fly to 35 cents in the coming days,” said
 Jonathan Bouchet , a Geneva-based trader at OTCex Group.  U.S. Sugar Output  U.S. raw-sugar output will total 8.23 million short tons in
the year that began Oct. 1, down 1.8 percent from 8.39 million
forecast last month, the Department of Agriculture  said  today.
Production estimates for Louisiana sugarcane and U.S. sugarbeets
were lowered.  The U.S. will import 2.74 million tons, 21 percent more
than was previously forecast, the agency said.  In London, refined sugar for March delivery gained for the
sixth time in seven sessions, climbing $25.20, or 3.2 percent,
to $803.50 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe, after touching $810.10,
the highest level for a most-active contract since at least
January 1989, when Bloomberg began recording data.  Robusta coffee rose to the highest price in more than two
years on speculation that adverse weather may delay crop
collection in Vietnam, the world’s second-largest grower. The
harvest, which usually starts in November, may be delayed by
rains in the Central Highlands,  Andrea Thompson , an analyst at
CoffeeNetwork in Belfast, Northern Ireland, said yesterday.  Robusta coffee futures for January delivery climbed $33, or
1.6 percent, to $2,079 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe, after
reaching $2,098, the highest price since Sept. 29, 2008.  Arabica coffee futures for December delivery, the contract
closest to expiration, added 7.3 cents, or 3.5 percent, to
$2.154 a pound in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2.1755,
the highest level since June 1997. The March contract, which has
the most open interest, advanced 6.55 cents, or 3.1 percent, to
$2.1725 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery gained $61, or 2.2
percent, to $2,889 a ton in New York. In London, the chocolate
ingredient for December delivery advanced 39 pounds, or 2.1
percent, to 1,868 pounds ($3,003) a ton in London.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 0.05 cent to
$1.553 a pound on ICE, after falling in the previous three
sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
