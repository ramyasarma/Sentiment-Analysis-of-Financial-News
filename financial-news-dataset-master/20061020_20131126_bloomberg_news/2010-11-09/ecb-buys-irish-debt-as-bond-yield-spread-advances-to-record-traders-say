The European Central Bank bought
Irish government bonds today, according to three traders with
knowledge of the transactions.  The ECB purchased bonds with maturities of less than 10
years, the traders said under condition of anonymity because the
deals are confidential. A spokesman for the central bank in
Frankfurt declined to comment.  Irish 10-year bonds tumbled for the 11th consecutive day,
sending the difference in yield, or spread, with similar-
maturity benchmark German bunds to a record 554 basis points, or
5.54 percentage points, according to Bloomberg generic data. The
Portuguese-German 10-year yield spread also widened to an all-
time high.  The ECB’s bond-buying program differs from so-called
quantitative easing policies pursued by the Federal Reserve and
the Bank of England because the central bank mops up the
liquidity created by the purchases, meaning the net effect on
the money supply is neutral.  The ECB began the program on May 10 to stabilize markets
rocked by the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The purchases were
part of a European Union-led push to rescue the euro, which fell
to a four-year low on June 7 after Greece’s near default raised
concern that some nations in the region would struggle to
finance their budget deficits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
