AES Corp. , the U.S. power producer
with operations in 29 countries, plans to spend as much as $15
billion to increase capacity in India and get 10 percent of its
revenue from the South Asian nation in five years.  “A big part of that would be financed by banks,” Chief
Executive Officer  Paul Hanrahan  said in an interview in New
Delhi today. “The equity piece would be about $4 billion to $5
billion.”  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government plans to tap
private investments as it seeks to double infrastructure
spending in India to $1 trillion in the five years ending 2017.
Asia’s second-biggest energy consumer is adding electricity-
generation capacity to reduce blackouts and fuel an economy that
grew at the fastest pace in more than two years in the three
months ended June 30.  “AES is joining a long list of companies building power
stations in India,” said  Michael Parker , a Hong Kong-based
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “Obstacles range from
fuel linkages, transmission, funding, environment approvals and
water-use rights. There are any number of details that can
derail projects.”  AES, based in Arlington, Virginia, is looking for partners
to build plants with a combined capacity of as much as 10,000
megawatts. The utility may sell shares in its Indian unit in
three to four years to fund these projects, said Hanrahan, who
was among U.S. business executives accompanying President Barack
Obama on his visit to India.  Electricity for All  The country’s current installed capacity is 164,836
megawatts. The government has pledged to provide electricity
nationwide by 2012 and needs to increase capacity to 200,000
megawatts to sustain economic growth, according to the power
ministry.  CLP Holdings Ltd. , Hong Kong’s biggest power producer,
plans to bid for large coal-fired plants in India and may spend
40 billion rupees ($902 million) to more than double capacity at
its 655-megawatt, gas-fired plant in Gujarat state.  Tata Power Co. , a unit of India’s biggest industrial group,
is spending 700 billion rupees to increase capacity more than
eightfold to 25,000 megawatts by 2017. Billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s
Reliance Power Ltd. plans to build projects totaling 33,780
megawatts.  Orissa, Chhattisgarh  State-owned  NTPC Ltd. , India’s biggest power producer with
32,194 megawatts of capacity is targeting generation of 75,000
megawatts by March 2017.  “Simply given the amount of capacity currently in planning
or under construction, the electricity market could look very
different come 2015,” said Parker, who rates Reliance Power an
“underperform” and NTPC a “market perform”.  AES currently owns 49 percent in a coal-fired  420-megawatt 
power plant in Orissa state with the local government holding
the rest. The Orissa plant’s capacity will be increased by 1,300
megawatts by 2014 and another 1,300 megawatts three years after
that, Hanrahan said.  AES has been awarded the rights to build a 1,200-megawatt
plant in Chhattisgarh state, he said.  The company is targeting 10 percent of its revenue from
India and 25 percent from Asia in five years, Hanrahan said. AES
received about 4.6 percent of its revenue from Asia last year,
compared with 69 percent from Latin America and 21 percent from
North America, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue from India is currently “inconsequential,”
Hanrahan said. AES reported  net income  of $114 million and
revenue of $4.2 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
