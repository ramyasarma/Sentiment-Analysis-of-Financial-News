South Africa’s Finance Minister,
Pravin Gordhan, said there is a need for “give and take”
between countries over how they manage their currencies,
Business Report said.  Countries that have taken action to weaken their currencies
should recognize the damage they have caused and take mitigating
measures, he said in an interview with a group of newspapers
including Johannesburg’s Business Report. He spoke ahead of
travelling to the G20 summit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
