Bank of Nova Scotia  sold $15 billion
in U.S. dollar debt this year, making it the third-largest
issuer as lenders exploit Canada’s safe-bank reputation to tap
foreign sources of funding after sales by U.S. banks plunged.  Investment-grade U.S.-dollar sales by Canadian banks such
as Scotiabank and Toronto-Dominion Bank accelerated to $31.5
billion this year, from $2.17 billion in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance by U.S. banks dropped 62 percent
to $67.8 billion, the data show. Covered bonds accounted for
about 41 percent of the sales by Canadian lenders.  The World Economic Forum ranked Canada’s financial system
the world’s soundest for the past three years, making its banks
popular investments relative to U.S. or European lenders.
Covered bonds sold by Canadian banks are backed by mortgages and
carry AAA ratings.  “People generally around the world perceive the Canadian
financial system as being very strong,”  Jeff Heath , executive
vice president and group treasurer at Bank of Nova Scotia, said
by phone from Toronto. “For debt investors looking to diversify
their risk, Canadian banks and us in particular, look like a
very favorable risk for them to hold.”  Canadian firms are taking advantage of favorable conditions
to tap U.S. debt markets, with corporate yields near two-decade
lows and spreads tightening. The extra yield investors demand to
hold the debt of U.S. investment-grade companies instead of
Treasuries tightened to 176 basis points at the end of last
week, from 209 basis points in June and 604 in December 2008,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  Consolidated Thompson  Elsewhere in credit markets, relative yields on Canada’s
corporate bonds over their federal counterparts tightened to 139
basis points, or 1.39 percentage points, from 141 basis points
at the end of last week and 143 basis points at the end of
October, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. The so-
called spread in global corporate bonds widened 1 basis point
from Oct. 31 to 165 basis points.  Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines, the Toronto-based mineral
explorer, sold $200 million of debt convertible to shares. The
U.S. dollar debt pays 5 percent and is convertible into shares
at a price of C$15.25 ($15.20) each until November 2017.  Talisman Energy Inc.  paid 128 basis points more than
similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries top sell $600 million of 3.75
percent notes due in February 2021 after increasing the size of
its offering.  VW Credit Canada Inc. sold C$550 million in 2.55 percent
bonds maturing in November 2013. Enbridge Income Fund raised
C$100 million in 4.85 percent notes due in November 2020.  Corporate Yields  Canadian corporate yields ended yesterday at 3.70 percent,
up from 3.67 percent last week and 3.64 percent at the end of
October, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index that
covers 709 bonds with a par value of C$279 billion. The index is
headed for a 9 percent return this year, from 15 percent last
year.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he’s
“apprehensive” about slowing global growth and urged world
leaders meeting this week in South Korea to coordinate policies.  Flaherty, according to the text of a speech he gave in
Jakarta, said the risk is countries may end up seeking to
cheapen their exchange rates unilaterally to bolster exports.  “There is a significant risk that countries will
increasingly undertake unilateral and trade-distorting measures
such as currency inflexibility and exchange rate intervention,”
Flaherty said. He said the Group of 20 nations must implement
its “comprehensive package of global reforms and continue to
demonstrate resolve and cohesion.”  Carney Speech  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  is due to speak at the
International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies today in
Geneva. His remarks will be available on the central bank’s
website at 12:15 p.m. New York time.  The nation’s five-year bond was little changed at 2.10
percent today in Toronto. The yield had been as high this year
as 3.24 percent in April. The price of the 3 percent security
due in December 2015 rose 1 cent to C$104.32.  Canadian new-home prices rose 0.2 percent in September, led
by Montreal, government figures showed. Economists predicted the
total index would rise 0.1 percent according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Canada will auction C$3 billion of 1.5 percent bonds
maturing in December 2012 tomorrow, according to a statement on
the Bank of Canada’s website. The central bank’s previous
auction of two-year bonds, on Sept. 13, drew an average yield of
1.42 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.43 times.  Provincial Bonds  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s broad index of provincial
bonds yielded 3.04 percent yesterday, up from 3.01 percent at
the end of last week. Yields fell to 2.897 percent on Oct. 19,
the lowest since at least 1992.  Canadian government bonds have returned 6.1 percent this
year, and are headed for a 9 percent annual return, the most
since 2008, when they returned 12 percent. U.S. Treasuries are
headed for a 10.5 percent return in 2010, compared with 6.9
percent for global government bonds.  Canada’s five biggest banks sold $3.2 billion in dollar
debt in 2008, and none ranked among the top 100 issuers in 2009
or 2008. They issued $15 billion in 2007, with Bank of Montreal
the 24th-biggest issuer.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Royal Bank of Canada ,
Bank of Montreal and  Toronto-Dominion Bank  join Scotia among the
top 100 issuers of U.S. dollar debt this year. None ranked in
the top 100 in 2008 or 2009.  Diversifying Sources  Scotiabank, which has operations in about 50 countries, has
agreed to buy businesses in Chile and Brazil this year to expand
wholesale and corporate lending businesses.  “Our funding strategy is about diversifying our sources,
as well as managing the costs,” Heath said. “When we looked
around the world -- and it’s been true pretty well all year --on
a relative basis, the U.S. offered us the best relative value as
an issuer.”  Operations outside of Canada accounted for about 30 percent
of the C$1.06 billion in  profit  in the latest quarter at
Canada’s third-largest bank.  Canadian banks didn’t issue much foreign-currency senior
debt during the crisis because costs were prohibitive, according
to  Altaf Nanji , senior credit strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital unit in Toronto.  Lower Finance Costs  “For 2008 and 2009 funding, banks weren’t doing very much
at all, even domestically, due to the crisis,” Nanji said via
e-mail. Canadian banks “pretty much only issue senior abroad,
and there wasn’t much need for senior debt funding at the cost
they would have to pay globally, considering the general lack of
balance sheet growth,” he wrote.  Scotiabank, based in Toronto, recorded C$1.69 billion in
debt-related writedowns during the biggest financial crisis
since the Great Depression. That compares to the $130.4 billion
recorded by New York-based Citigroup Inc.  Covered bonds offer holders a preferential claim against
the cash flows arising from the covered assets, allowing banks
to reduce financing costs. U.S. covered bond spreads ended last
week at 122 basis points, compared with 176 for U.S. investment
grade spreads, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data shows. Some
mortgages used to back Canadian covered bonds are guaranteed by
the nation’s housing agency.  Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, the German development
bank, and General Electric Co. are the two largest issuers of
U.S. investment grade debt this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
