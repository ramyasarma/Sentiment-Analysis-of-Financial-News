Most stocks in Switzerland rose,
sending the Swiss Market Index towards its highest close in six
months, as results from Adecco SA and Swisscom AG exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Adecco rallied 4.8 percent. Swisscom, the nation’s largest
phone company, increased 2.2 percent. Gains in the benchmark
index were limited as drugmaker Novartis AG fell 1 percent.  The  SMI  rose 0.1 percent to 6,607.37 at 2:27 p.m. in Zurich
as stocks sensitive to economic growth advanced. Four companies
advanced for every one that fell on the gauge. The measure has
rallied 11 percent since its low this year in July as concern
eased that the global economy recovery would stall. The broader
Swiss Performance Index rose 0.1 percent to 5,878.53 today.  “The market hasn’t risen higher as cyclical stocks like
Adecco are low weight,” said  Mauro Casalini , who manages 280
million francs ($291 million) in Swiss equities at BSI SA
Lugano. “If you want to get the SMI back to 7,000 we need both
the main banks to perform better. We expect the financials will
catch up but for healthcare I’m a bit uncertain.”  Adecco , the world’s largest supplier of temporary workers,
rose 4.8 percent to 61.40 francs. The company announced third-
quarter net income of 128 million euros ($178 million), an
increase of 42 percent on a year earlier. Profit beat the 109.6
million-euro average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 36 percent to 5.06 billion euros, helped
by Adecco’s $1.19 billion acquisition of MPS, completed in
January.  Top-Line Growth  “Results were stronger than expected, driven by higher
top-line growth, stable margins and stable costs,” said a
Vontobel research note.  Swisscom  increased 2.2 percent to 420.30 francs after
raising its revenue forecast to 12 billion francs ($12.5
billion) for 2010. Net income for the third quarter gained to
536 million Swiss francs from 512 million francs a year earlier,
the Bern-based company said today. Net revenue advanced 0.7
percent to 3.03 billion francs.  Analysts had estimated net income of 510.9 million francs
on sales of 2.98 billion francs.  LEM Holding SA rose 8 percent to 471 francs after
announcing net profit of 19.8 million francs and forecasting
sales for the year of 285 million francs to 295 million francs.  The sales forecast was above estimates, analysts at Helvea
wrote in a note to clients. The guidance shows that “demand is
still extremely healthy,” according to the analysts.  Swissquote, Micronas jump  Swissquote Group Holding AG  jumped 4 percent to 48.70
francs after Helvea raised its price estimate to 53 francs and
its profit forecast for 2012 by 7.9 percent. Switzerland’s
largest online broker kept its neutral rating from Helvea after
third-quarter profit fell short of estimates.  Micronas Semiconductor Holding AG rose 5.7 percent to 8.57
francs after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its price estimate
on the stock from 6.50 to 10.00 francs and increased its 2010-11
earnings-per-share estimates.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. Ltd.  increased 1.5 percent to 51.75
francs after competitor Munich Re, the world’s biggest
reinsurer, beat analysts’ forecasts for net income and raised
its 2010 profit guidance.  Pharmaceutical stocks fell, led by Novartis, which fell 1
percent to 55.55 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Giles Broom  in Zurich at
