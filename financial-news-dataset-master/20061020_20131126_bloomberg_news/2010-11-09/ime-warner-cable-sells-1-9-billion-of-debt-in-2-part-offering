Time Warner Cable Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. cable operator, sold $1.9 billion of bonds to pay
for buying back shares and refinancing debt.  The company issued $700 million of 4.125 percent notes due
in February 2021 and $1.2 billion of 5.875 percent bonds
maturing in November 2040, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
including debt refinancing and stock buybacks, the company said
today in a statement.  Time Warner Cable is taking advantage of borrowing costs
for investment-grade companies near record lows, tapping the
bond market as it repurchases shares for the first time since
Time Warner Inc. spun it off in March 2009. The New York-based
company announced a plan to buy back $4 billion of stock on Nov.
4 after reporting third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  “The low cost of funds is what’s drawing them in,” said
 Michael Hodel , an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. “It’s
an opportunity for them to take advantage of cheap financing and
accelerating their purchases.”  The notes maturing in 2021 yield 155 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and the bonds due in 2040 pay a
spread of 180 basis points, Bloomberg data show. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Sale Managers  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing the sale, Time Warner
Cable said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  Moody’s Investors Service grades Time Warner Cable Baa2 and
Standard & Poor’s ranks the company an equivalent BBB.  Yields on investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds averaged
3.59 percent yesterday and touched 3.53 percent on Nov. 4, the
lowest on record, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  Time Warner Cable, which trails only Comcast Corp. by
number of subscribers, reported third-quarter net income rose 34
percent to $360 million, or $1 a share, from $268 million, or 76
cents a share, bolstered by higher monthly bills, an increase in
high-speed Internet subscribers and a rise in advertising sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
