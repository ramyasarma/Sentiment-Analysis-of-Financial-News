Qantas Airways Ltd. , Australia’s
largest airline, has deployed replacement planes to service all
routes affected by the grounding of its six Airbus SAS A380
aircraft after the inflight explosion of an engine last week.  The remaining backlog of passengers, fewer than 100 people
in Los Angeles, would be cleared by the end of Nov. 8 local time,
Sydney-based Qantas said in an e-mailed statement today.  Rolls-
Royce Group Plc  earlier said the cause of the engine blowout on
the Nov. 4 flight is specific to the Trent 900 model involved.  Qantas’s A380 fleet will remain grounded until at least
Nov. 11 as it works with Rolls-Royce and regulators to determine
the cause of the incident that forced an emergency landing in
Singapore and prompted the grounding. Chief Executive Officer
 Alan Joyce  yesterday said oil was found where it “shouldn’t
be” in three engines on separate planes during safety checks  Qantas  shares  fell 1.8 percent to A$2.75 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading in Sydney. The stock has dropped 8 percent this
year compared with a 2.7 percent decline by the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index.  Rolls-Royce said the Qantas engine failure is unconnected
to the Trent 1000 blast that happened on Aug. 2 “during a
development program with an engine operating outside normal
parameters,” the London-based company said in a statement.  The A380 blowout was the first of its kind on a large civil
engine built by the company since 1994, Rolls-Royce said. The
company will provide more information when it updates investors
on trading Nov. 12, it said.  A day after the A380 incident, a Qantas  Boeing Co. 747  also
returned to Singapore following an engine failure in a different
Rolls-Royce powerplant.  No one was injured in the incidents.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG , the only
other carriers flying Rolls-Royce-powered A380s, have resumed
flights after conducting checks recommended by Airbus and the
London-based engine maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
