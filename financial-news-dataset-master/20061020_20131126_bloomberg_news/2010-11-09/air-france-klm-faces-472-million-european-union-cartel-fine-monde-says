Air France-KLM Group may be fined
339.5 million euros by European Union regulators over its role
in a global cargo cartel, French daily newspaper Le Monde
reported, without saying where it got the information.  British Airways PLC may also be fined 104 million euros in
the same case, which affects 11 carriers, according to Le Monde.
Air France-KLM is likely to appeal the fine, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
