The U.S.’s so-called quantitative
easing will have a negative impact on the global economy, Dai
Xianglong, chairman of China’s National Council for Social
Security Fund, said at a forum in Beijing today.  Quantitative easing in the U.S. may weaken the dollar and
increase the relative value of other currencies, Dai said. It
will also cause hot money to flow into emerging economies, he
said. Prices in the U.S. and the price of commodities may
increase, Dai said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
