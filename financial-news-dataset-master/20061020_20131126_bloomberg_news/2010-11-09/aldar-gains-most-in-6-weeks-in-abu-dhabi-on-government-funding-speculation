Aldar Properties PJSC climbed the
most since September on speculation Abu Dhabi’s biggest
developer will secure government funding.  The shares rose 3.2 percent, the most since Sept. 26, to
2.29 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi. The shares soared
as much as 9.5 percent. They also slumped as much as 5.9 percent
after the company posted a nine-month net loss of 1.52 billion
dirhams ($414 million).  “Aldar has highlighted that it’s in final negotiations
with the government and that they will announce a funding plan
by year end, this alleviates some of the concern out there,”
said Majed Azzam, a real-estate analyst at Alembic HC
Securities. “The main issue is not its quarterly performance
but rather its liquidity position.”  The developer said it expects to reach a “framework”
agreement with Abu Dhabi’s government on cash requirements by
the end of the year. The builder of thousands of homes and
offices across the emirate has been hurt by falling sales and
has about 26 billion dirhams of outstanding debt.   To contact the reporter on this story:
