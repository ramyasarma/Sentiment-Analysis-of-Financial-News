A riot in an overcrowded prison in
Brazil that left 18 inmates dead has ended after 27 hours, O
Globo newspaper reported.  Inmates at the Sao Luis penitentiary in northern Maranhao
state took several guards hostage yesterday to demand better
treatment, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  A guard was shot during a shootout to regain control of the
facility, which was holding twice the 2,000 inmates it was built
for, O Globo said. The last three guards being held were
released today, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
