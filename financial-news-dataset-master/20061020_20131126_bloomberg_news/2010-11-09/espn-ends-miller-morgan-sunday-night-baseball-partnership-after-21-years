Jon Miller  and  Joe Morgan  won’t
return as announcers for ESPN’s “ Sunday Night Baseball ,”
ending a 21-year association.  The Walt Disney Co.  sports network declined to renew
Morgan’s contract and gave Miller the option of staying on as
ESPN’s radio voice for its Sunday night Major League Baseball
games and the playoffs.  “Over the last two decades, Joe went from Hall of Fame
player to one of his sport’s top analysts and Jon’s Hall of Fame
voice and tremendous knowledge of the game have connected with
baseball fans everywhere,” ESPN Executive Vice President  Norby Williamson  said in a statement. “We owe them our deepest thanks
for an outstanding body of work.”  Miller will probably be replaced as the play-by-play
announcer by Dan Schulman, while former major league pitcher
 Orel Hershiser  would fill Morgan’s role providing color
commentary, the New York Times said. Former New York Mets
manager  Bobby Valentine  could make it a three-man booth if he
doesn’t land another managerial job, the paper said.  Miller, 59, earlier this year received the Ford C. Frick
Award for broadcasting excellence from the National Baseball
Hall of Fame. Morgan, 67, helped lead the Cincinnati Reds to
consecutive World Series titles in 1975-76 and was inducted into
the Hall of Fame as a player in 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
