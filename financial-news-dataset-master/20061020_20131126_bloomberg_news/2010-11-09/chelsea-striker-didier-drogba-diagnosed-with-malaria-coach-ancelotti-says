Chelsea soccer striker Didier Drogba
has been suffering from malaria, coach Carlo Ancelotti said in a
televised news conference.  The Ivory Coast player was originally thought to have
a virus and came on as a substitute in the 2-0 loss at
Liverpool two days ago.  He’s recovered well and is due to play against Fulham at
Stamford Bridge tomorrow, Ancelotti said.   “He’s had treatment and now he’s OK, he’ll come back
immediately in the best condition,” he said. “He suffered,
obviously, because he wasn’t 100 percent but now, after
treatment, he’ll be better.”  Ancelotti said he didn’t know where Drogba got the disease.  “I gave him a few days off and he went on holiday for
a few days, and then he has malaria. But it’s over now.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
