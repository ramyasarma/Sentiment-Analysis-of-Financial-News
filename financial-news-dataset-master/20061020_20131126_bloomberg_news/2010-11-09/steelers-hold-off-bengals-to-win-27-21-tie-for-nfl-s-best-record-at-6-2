The Pittsburgh Steelers withstood a
fourth-quarter rally to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 27-21 and
tie for the best record in the National Football League.  The Steelers improved to 6-2 when linebacker  James Harrison 
knocked a fourth-down pass out of the hands of Bengals receiver
 Jordan Shipley  at the Pittsburgh 5-yard line with 34 seconds
left at Cincinnati’s Paul Brown Stadium last night.  Pittsburgh avoided blowing a lead of 20 or more points for
the first time in franchise history and remains tied with
Baltimore atop the American Football Conference’s North
Division. The Steelers are also tied with the Ravens, New York
Giants, New York Jets, Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots
for the NFL’s best record through Week 9.  “We almost gave it away, but the defense held strong,”
Steelers quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  said during a televised
interview.  The Steelers led 20-7 at halftime as  Rashard Mendenhall 
scored on a 1-yard touchdown run and Roethlisberger threw an 8-
yard scoring pass to  Hines Ward . Pittsburgh increased its lead
when  Antwaan Randle El  tossed a 39-yard touchdown pass on a
trick play to  Mike Wallace  to begin the fourth quarter.  The Bengals then pulled within 27-21 as  Terrell Owens 
caught his second touchdown pass of the game and  Cedric Benson 
scored on a 1-yard run.  After  Jeff Reed  missed a 46-yard field goal for Pittsburgh
with 3:59 left, Cincinnati drove 67 yards in 12 plays before
being turned away by a Steelers defense that’s allowed a league-
low 123 points this season.  The Steelers, who next host the Patriots on Nov. 14,
improved to 6-0 in “Monday Night Football” games under coach
 Mike Tomlin .  “We’re far from perfect, but we’re 6-2,” Tomlin said
during a news conference. “It’s great to get out of here with a
win. I liked the way our team fought. We made some mistakes, but
we did enough to win the game.”  Owens finished with 10 receptions for 141 yards and two
scores for the Bengals (2-6).  To contact the reporter on this story:
