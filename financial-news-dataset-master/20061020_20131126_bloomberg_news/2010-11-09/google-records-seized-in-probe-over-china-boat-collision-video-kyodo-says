Tokyo prosecutors seized Google Inc.
records as part of an investigation into how video of a
collision between a Japanese Coast Guard vessel and a Chinese
fishing boat was leaked onto the YouTube website, Kyodo News
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Yoshi Funabashi , a Tokyo-based spokesman for Google, which
owns the YouTube website, said the company couldn’t confirm
whether it has been contacted by the prosecutor’s office.  The posting of the video last week came as Japanese Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  works to ease tensions with China before a
Nov. 13-14 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Yokohama.  The Sept. 7 collision prompted Japanese authorities to
detain the captain of the Chinese trawler, in turn prompting
China’s government to suspend ministerial talks and halt
exports of rare earth metals to Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
