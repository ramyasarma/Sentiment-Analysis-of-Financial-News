month.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 47.25 cents, or

contract since Aug. 28, 2008.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $6.085 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $6.175,
the highest level since Aug. 25, 2008. Wheat futures for
December delivery advanced 13.25 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
