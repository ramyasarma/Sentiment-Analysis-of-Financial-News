Dylan Hartley will start at hooker
for the England rugby team in this weekend’s game against
Australia at Twickenham in London.      Hartley, who came off the bench to score England’s only try
in a 26-16 loss to New Zealand three days ago, replaces Steve
Thompson. Manager Martin Johnson made one other change to his
squad for the Nov. 13 Test, adding Simon Shaw as a substitute
for the injured David Attwood.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
