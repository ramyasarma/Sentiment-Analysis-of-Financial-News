The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
said Kenneth C. Montgomery will become its chief operating
officer and first vice president on Jan. 1.  Montgomery, who is now executive vice president and system
chief technology officer at the Federal Reserve System’s
information technology organization in Richmond, Virginia, will
succeed  Paul M. Connolly , the Boston Fed said in a statement
today. Connolly, 61, announced in April that he planned to
retire at the end of the year.  “The broad-based knowledge, leadership and positive energy
that Ken has exhibited throughout his career in the Federal
Reserve System, as well as his experience and insights into a
wide array of operations and business areas, make him an
excellent choice to fill this important position,” Boston Fed
President  Eric Rosengren  said in the statement.  Montgomery, 51, who has an undergraduate degree from Seton
Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, and a master’s
degree in business administration from Fairleigh Dickinson
University in New Jersey, joined the New York Fed in 1983 and
became an officer in its automation group. Since 1994, he has
been working with the Fed’s information technology organization
and its predecessor system at the Richmond Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
