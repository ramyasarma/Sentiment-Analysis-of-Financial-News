The Australian government expects to
sell less debt in the 12 months ending June 30, 2011, after the
Treasury reviewed the budget.  The government probably will sell between A$53 billion and
A$58.5 billion of bonds, bills and inflation-indexed debt in the
current fiscal year, rather than A$60 billion as previously
estimated, the Canberra-based Australian Office of Financial
Management said today on its website. The AOFM has sold A$21.2
billion of bonds and A$1.9 billion of indexed notes since July
1, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
