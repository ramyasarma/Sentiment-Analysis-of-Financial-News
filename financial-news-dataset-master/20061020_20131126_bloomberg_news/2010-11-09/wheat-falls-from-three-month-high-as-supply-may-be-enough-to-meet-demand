Wheat futures tumbled from a three-
month high on speculation that world supplies may be adequate to
meet demand.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture said today that global
inventories on May 31 will total 172.51 million metric tons, 1.2
percent less than estimated last month. Traders may have
anticipated the cut because futures rallied 6.7 percent in the
previous three sessions, said  Larry Young , the president of
Covenant Trading LLC. U.S. production may total 2.208 billion
bushels, little changed from the previous year, the USDA said.  The government report “wasn’t a surprise,” Young said
from Chicago. “In terms of the fundamental supply, the wheat is
out there and available. We had a good crop this year.”  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 14.5 cents, or
2 percent, to settle at $7.2175 bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price climbed 3.3 percent
to $7.6075, the highest level for a most-active contract since
Aug. 12.  Investors sold contracts to take advantage of the earlier
rally, Young said. Wheat has surged 50 percent since the end of
June, after drought harmed crops in Russia, spurring the country
to halt exports in August.  Today, “traders saw this as an opportunity to cap a three-
day trend,” Young said. “We’ve been at some really high levels
at a time when normally you’d see the market in a lower trading
range, due to harvest pressure.”  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
