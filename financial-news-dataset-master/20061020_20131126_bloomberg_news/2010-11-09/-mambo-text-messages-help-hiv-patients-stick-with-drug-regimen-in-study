Patients with HIV maintained drug
regimens, reducing the amount of virus in their blood when 
health-care workers sent them a weekly reminder text message,
a study found.  The phone messages helped 12 percent of patients better
stay with their treatment, compared with a group that did not 
have mobile follow-up, according to the research, published 
in the medical journal  The Lancet . About 9 percent more 
patients saw the amount of virus in their blood drop.  The study followed 538 people starting anti-viral drug
treatment at three clinics in Kenya. About half of them received
texts at weekly intervals. They had to respond to the message
“Mambo,” Kiswahili for “How are you,” with either “Sawa”
if they were doing well, or “Shida” if they weren’t. Those who
gave the latter response or didn’t answer got a follow-up call
from the clinic.  “Ensuring strict adherence to immunosuppressive
antiretroviral regimens remains a formidable challenge,”
Benjamin Chi and Jeffrey Stringer of the  Centre for Infectious
Disease Research in Zambia , said in an accompanying editorial.  The messages, which cost about 5 cents each, help one
additional patient achieve viral suppression for every 12 ones
texted, the study said. The research, which ran for about a one-
and-a-half years, was led by  Richard Lester  of the  British
Columbia Centre for Disease Control  in Vancouver.  “The SMS intervention was well received by patients, many
of whom reported that they felt ‘‘like someone cares,’’ the
researchers wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
