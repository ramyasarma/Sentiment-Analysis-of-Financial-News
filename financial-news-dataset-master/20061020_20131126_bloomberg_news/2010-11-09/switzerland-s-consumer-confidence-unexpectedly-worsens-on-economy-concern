Swiss  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly worsened in October as households grew more
pessimistic about the economic outlook and the labor market.  An  index  based on a quarterly survey of about 1,100
households fell to 7 from 16 in July, the  State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs  in Bern said in a  statement  today. That’s the
lowest since January. Economists forecast a gain to 17, the
median of eight estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey  showed.  The Swiss economy is losing momentum as a global slowdown
threatens to hurt exports and undermine labor demand. The
government in September lowered its growth projection for 2011,
the KOF leading economic indicator fell in October and
 manufacturing industries  grew at a weaker pace.  “Switzerland’s economy will show a moderation in 2011,”
said Nicole Froehlich, an economist at Clariden Leu AG in
Zurich. “We’re seeing a retreat from pre-crisis levels.”  The franc appreciated after the report, trading at 1.3353
versus the euro at 9:06 a.m. in Zurich, up from 1.3448
yesterday.  A gauge measuring households’ expectations in unemployment
over the coming 12 months jumped to 17 from 6 in July, today’s
report showed. An indicator of confidence in the economic
outlook fell to 19 from 33 and consumers also grew less
optimistic about prospects of their financial situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
