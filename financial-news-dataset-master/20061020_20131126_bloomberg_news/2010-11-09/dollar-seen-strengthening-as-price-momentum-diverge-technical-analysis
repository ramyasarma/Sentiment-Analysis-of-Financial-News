The  dollar  may rally to a level last
reached in September as the greenback’s price against a basket
of currencies including the euro and yen diverges from a
momentum gauge, according to Citigroup Inc.  The November low of IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar
Index is beneath the previous month’s low, while the low in a
 stochastic gauge  of momentum this month is higher than its low
in October. Similar “momentum divergence” seen in November
2009 indicates a possible increase in the gauge of the greenback
to 79.31, Citigroup analysts led by New York-based  Tom Fitzpatrick  wrote in a research note to clients today. The last
time the index reached that level was Sept. 28.  “The big difference is you have a low that is lower than
the low from October on the price chart of the Dollar Index, but
momentum has turned from a higher low compared to October,”
Fitzpatrick said in a telephone interview.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency against
the  euro,  yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Swedish
krona, was little changed at 77.098 at 11:15 a.m. in New York.
It has fallen more than 13 percent from its 2010 high of 88.708,
reached June 7. It has gained 0.6 percent this week.  Stochastic oscillator charts measure the price of a
security or currency relative to its highs and lows. In
technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts of
trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
