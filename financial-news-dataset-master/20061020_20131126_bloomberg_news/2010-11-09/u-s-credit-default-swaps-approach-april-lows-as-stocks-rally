The cost of protecting bonds in the
U.S. from default rose for the second day, after falling last
week to the lowest in six months, on concern that the debt rally
is running “out of gas.”  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.7 basis points to a mid-
price of 90.5 basis points as of 4:56 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. Earlier the
index dropped as much as 2.5 basis points on better-than-
expected corporate earnings and a decline in Europe’s benchmark
swap index.  “It was just a little optimism on the back of Europe,”
 Michael Kraft , who oversees a fixed-income hedge fund at Crimson
Capital Trading LLC in New York, said of the index’s earlier
gains. “The credit markets are for the most part out of gas.”  The reversal comes after U.S. stocks and the benchmark risk
index rallied last week as the Federal Reserve announced a $600
billion bond-purchase plan to boost economic growth, a tactic
known as quantitative easing.  The Markit index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, fell 45.7
basis points since June to 85.6 on Nov. 5. That was the lowest
since April 15, when it ended at 82 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 1.2 basis points to 99.3, and
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 6.8
basis points to 437.7, Markit prices show. The contracts are
down from 529.8 on Sept. 23.  Sara Lee, Grupo Bimbo  Credit-default swaps on Downers Grove, Illinois-based Sara
Lee Corp. declined 8.1 basis points to 118, CMA data show.
Mexico City-based  Grupo Bimbo SAB , the world’s largest bread
maker, agreed to buy Sara Lee’s North American bakery business
for $959 million to boost international sales.  Contracts on International Game Technology, the Reno,
Nevada-based slot-machine maker, lost 7.3 basis points to 183.7,
and those on Islandia, New York-based CA Inc., the maker of
software for mainframe computers, declined 11 basis points to
110.1, the data show.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
