UniCredit SpA , Italy’s biggest bank,
will name the new head of its corporate- and investment-banking
division in the next few weeks, according to General Manager
 Roberto Nicastro .  UniCredit will also appoint a new leader for its business
in central and eastern Europe after the former head of the
division,  Federico Ghizzoni , replaced  Alessandro Profumo  as
chief executive officer in September, he said.  Sergio Ermotti 
decided to step down as head of the investment-banking unit
after a management shakeup on Oct. 26.  “We are working on the matter,” Nicastro told reporters
today while at the Ita-Turk forum in Rome. “The nominations
will be made in the next weeks. There are no changes in our
strategy.”  UniCredit, based in Milan, expects a “strong
contribution” from the CEE division because of the “faster
economic growth in the area,” Nicastro said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
