The Eastern and Southern Trade
Development Bank, the Burundi-based lender known as  PTA Bank ,
said it sold $300 million of five-year Eurobonds to fund loans
small- and medium-sized businesses in the region.  The securities are part of a $1 billion program to
“diversify the bank’s resource base and to raise funding,” PTA
Bank President  Michael Gondwe  said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, where the lender
has an office.  The debt, which matures on Jan. 9 2016, was sold at 6.875
percent,  CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd. , the Kenyan bank that arranged
the transaction, said in an e-mailed statement. The first coupon
will be paid on July 9, 2011, it said.  “A coupon of 6.875 percent is costly,” said  Fred Moturi , a
fixed-income trader at Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank
Ltd. “Right now, the market rate is about 5 percent for a five-
year bond in Kenya sold in Kenyan shillings. If it does well, a
lot of companies will tap into the international debt market.”  Ghana’s 8.5 percent fixed-rate Eurobond, due October 2017,
climbed for a third day, rising 26 cents to $115.48, reducing
the yield by 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.75
percent by the close of trade yesterday.  Debt Ratings  PTA Bank has been assigned a BB rating by Fitch Ratings,
two steps below investment grade, and Ba1, or the highest non-
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service.  In July 2005, the lender sold seven-year bonds worth 800
million Kenyan shillings ($9.9 million) and in October 2007, it
sold seven-year bonds worth 1 billion shillings. Both of those
issues, which are traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, have a
coupon rate of 1 percent above the 91-day Treasury bill rate,
according to data from the Kenyan bourse.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , which is based in Johannesburg,
and London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc  acted as book runners for the
Eurobond sale, CFC Stanbic said.  “This is an affirmation that political risk is taking a
back seat and sets the stage for new sovereign issues in East
and Central Africa,” CFC Stanbic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
