Jonathan Duhamel became Canada’s
first  World Series of Poker  main-event champion, knocking out
John Racener to claim the $8.9 million first prize.  Duhamel won the No-Limit  Texas Hold’Em  world championship
after about two hours of heads-up play that began late yesterday
at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.  The 23-year-old Duhamel, of Boucherville, Quebec, ran over
to a group of friends wearing Montreal Canadiens hockey jerseys
after the winning hand and was lifted into the air in
celebration. He then received a diamond-encrusted gold bracelet
in addition to the top prize, which was piled on the table in
stacks of $100 bills.  Duhamel had started head-to-head play with 189 million
chips to about 30.8 million for Racener. He increased his stack
to 205 million before Racener bet his remaining 14.95 million
with a king and eight. Duhamel had an ace and a jack, and won
the hand and title when the five shared cards came up 4-4-9-6-5.
It was the 43rd hand of heads-up play.  Racener, a 24-year-old poker professional from Port Richey,
Florida, received $5.5 million as the runner-up.  The head-to-head final capped the $10,000 buy-in event that
began in July with 7,319 participants. Nine players advanced to
the final table, with seven being eliminated during a 13-hour
session that was completed early on the morning of Nov. 7.  Duhamel majored in finance before dropping out of the
University of Quebec in Montreal. He’s been a full-time poker
pro -- mostly online -- for about the last two years, earning
$43,000 in WSOP events before today’s payday.  Two Canadians previously finished second in the 41-year
history of the World Series of Poker’s main event. Tuan Lam was
beaten by Jerry Yang in 2007 and Howard Goldfarb lost to Dan
Harrington in 1995.  The last main event winner from outside the U.S. was
Denmark’s Peter Eastgate in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
