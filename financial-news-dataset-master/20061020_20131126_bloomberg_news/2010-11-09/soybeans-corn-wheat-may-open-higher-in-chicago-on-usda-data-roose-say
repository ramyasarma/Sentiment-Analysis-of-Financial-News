Soybean futures may open 15 cents to
25 cents a bushel higher in Chicago after the U.S. government
cut its estimate for domestic inventories before next year’s
harvest, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.  U.S. soybean stockpiles will total 185 million bushels on
Aug. 31, or 30 percent less than forecast in October, as rising
exports soak up an increase in production, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said today.  Corn futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade, and wheat may open 5 cents to 8
cents a bushel higher, Roose said in a telephone interview from
West Des Moines, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
