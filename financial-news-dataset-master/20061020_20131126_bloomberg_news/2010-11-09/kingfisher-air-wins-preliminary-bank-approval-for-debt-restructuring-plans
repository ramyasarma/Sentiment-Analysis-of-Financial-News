Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. , India’s
second-biggest domestic carrier, said it got preliminary
approval from lenders for a debt restructuring plan to cut
interest costs and benefit from rising demand for air travel.  “The bank consortium has agreed generally to the
package,”  Ravi Nedungadi , chief financial officer at the
carrier’s parent UB Group, said today by phone. “Now each of
the banks has to necessarily pass it through their respective
board, so we’ll wait for them to approve before we comment on
the restructuring plan.”  The airline has lost money six years in a row, accumulating
 net debt  of 77.2 billion rupees ($1.74 billion) as of March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Billionaire founder and
Chairman  Vijay Mallya  in September said a planned debt revamp
would slash interest costs by as much as 11 percent. The central
bank approved the plan in the same month.  Kingfisher  gained  1.5 percent to 87.7 rupees at 10:31 a.m.
in Mumbai trading. The shares have gained 39 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent advance by the benchmark Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index.  State Bank of India Ltd., the nation’s largest, said
yesterday that it would approve the debt restructuring program
by the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
