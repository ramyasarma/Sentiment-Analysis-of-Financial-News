Daikin Industries Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest air conditioner maker, cut its annual profit
forecast by a third after posting a quarterly loss.  Net income is expected to be 25 billion yen ($309 million)
for the year ending March 31, compared with an earlier estimate
of 37 billion yen, Daikin said in a statement. It cited the
yen’s strength and economic uncertainty for the outlook cut.  “Business conditions have become increasingly uncertain
since the effects of economic policies in various countries have
worn off,” Chairman  Noriyuki Inoue  said today at a briefing in
Osaka, where the company is based. He estimated the yen, which
has risen 13 percent against the U.S. currency since April, will
trade at 80 per dollar in the second half.  Daikin’s net loss was 1.16 billion yen in the three months
ended Sept. 30, compared with a 7.82 billion yen profit a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg  data . The company, in a
preliminary earnings statement on Oct. 1, said it booked a 23.4
billion yen charge in the quarter because of a drop in the value
of its stockholdings.  Second-quarter operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, rose 89 percent to 24.7
billion yen, beating the 23.4 billion yen average of four
analysts’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 17 percent
to 310 billion yen.  The  shares  closed 1.3 percent lower at 2,972 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement, the first decline
in four days. Daikin is down 19 percent this year, compared with
an 8.1 percent drop in the  Nikkei  225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
