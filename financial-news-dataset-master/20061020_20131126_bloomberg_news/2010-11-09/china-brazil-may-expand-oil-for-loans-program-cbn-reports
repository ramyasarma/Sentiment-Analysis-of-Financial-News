China and Brazil may expand an oil-
for-loans program to intensify energy cooperation, China
Business News reported, citing an unidentified official at the
National Energy Administration in Beijing.  Energy officials from the two nations may meet in Beijing
in the fourth quarter “to discuss many topics,” the Chinese-
language newspaper said today, citing the official.  China Development Bank Corp. agreed to lend $10 billion to
Petroleo Brasileiro SA which in return will supply crude oil to
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  for 10 years, the state-
controlled Brazilian oil company said in November last year.  The newspaper didn’t say if Chinese loans to Brazil will
increase or whether crude supplies to China will expand. Zeng
Yachuan, the Beijing-based spokesman of the National Energy
administration, didn’t pick up calls to his office.  -- Wang Ying  and  Zhe Huang  in Beijing. Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
