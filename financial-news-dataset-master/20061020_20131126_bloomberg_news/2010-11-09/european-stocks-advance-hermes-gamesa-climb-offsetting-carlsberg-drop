European stocks climbed as gains by
Hermes International SCA and Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA
offset a retreat by Carlsberg A/S.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.3 percent to 272.74 as
of 8:45 a.m. in London. Carlsberg fell 5.3 percent to 564.50
kroner, the largest decline in the Stoxx 600 after the Danish
brewer posted third-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
