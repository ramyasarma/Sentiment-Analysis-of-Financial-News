Goodman Property Trust , New
Zealand’s second-largest publicly traded real estate investor,
reported a half-year net loss after incurring a NZ$132 million
($103 million) tax depreciation charge.  The company’s net loss was NZ$99.2 million for the six
months to Sept. 30, compared with a profit of NZ$18.2 million a
year earlier, it said in a statement. Rule changes that removed
tax deductions for depreciation on buildings resulted in the
one-off charge, the company said.  While the loss helped to reduce Goodman’s net tangible
assets per unit by 20 percent to 82.29 cents, the tax liability
would not affect the company’s operating profits, it said.
Goodman reported a NZ$30.9 million profit before the charge,
compared with NZ$13.2 million a year earlier, the company said.  Goodman “recorded a solid operation performance and what
should be a strong profit result of $30.9 million has been
impacted by an accounting adjustment,” Keith Smith, chairman of
Goodman (N.Z.) Ltd., said in the statement.  The trust owns NZ$1.54 billion of industrial and business
space around New Zealand, according to the statement. About 95
percent of its buildings are occupied, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
