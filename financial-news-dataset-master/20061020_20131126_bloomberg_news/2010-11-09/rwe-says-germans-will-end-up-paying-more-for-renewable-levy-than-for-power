RWE AG  said the cost to German
households of subsidizing renewable energy generation will
exceed power costs by 2012.  “We can now predict for the first time the renewable levy
on the household bill will be higher than the actual electricity
price,”  Stefan Judisch , chief executive officer for supply at
RWE Supply and Trading GmbH, said at the European Autumn Gas
Conference in Berlin today. “People will pay more renewable
contribution than they pay for the electricity.”  Natural-gas-fired power generation will be the back-up for
wind power and other renewable generation sources, according to
Judisch. “It is clear we are at a turning point,” he said.  Power prices for German households will go up as much as 40
percent because of renewable charges, Judisch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
