U.S. drivers age 65 or older will
increase from 15 percent to 20 percent of the driving population
by 2025, prompting a safety panel to consider recommendations
such as new designs for automobiles and roads and testing
requirements for elderly motorists.  The issue of older drivers is a “rising tide” as the U.S.
population ages and life expectancy increases,  Deborah Hersman ,
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said today
at a forum in Washington on older drivers. “The real challenge
for all of us, whether it’s for our parents or for us, is when
do you reach that point” to stop driving, she said in an
interview.  The meeting marks the first time in its 40 years that the
agency has looked at safety issues involving older drivers. “We
want to know what the risks are and what some of the possible
mitigations are,” she said.  The board, which issues recommendations to improve
transportation safety, could use its evaluation to suggest
automobile or road designs that would be safer for older
drivers, Hersman said. The board could recommend medical-related
considerations for licensing older drivers for whom dementia is
a particular concern, she said.  The NTSB considered medical- and age-related causes of a
2003 accident in Santa Monica, California, where an 86-year-old
man drove his car through an outdoor market killing 10 people.  32 Million on the Road  Licensed drivers age 65 and older number more than 32
million today and are more likely to die or be seriously injured
in crashes than younger people behind the wheel, Hersman said.  “America is aging,” she said. “Baby-boomers are now well
into their middle years. More and more seniors are on the road
than ever before.”  Aging drivers may face risk from illnesses, including
dementia, Bonnie Dobbs, who directs the Medically At-Risk Driver
Centre at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said at
the forum. Licenses for drivers with cognitive impairments must
be restricted just as a drunk driver wouldn’t be allowed behind
the wheel, she said.  The safety board, based in Washington, investigates
transportation accidents and recommends safety-related changes
to regulators, lawmakers and companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
