A bacterial vine disease could have
affected as many as 18 New Zealand kiwifruit orchards,  Radio New
Zealand  reported, citing a government official.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry may seek to
contain the outbreak of Pseudomonas syringae pv actinidiae if
more cases are confirmed, the broadcaster’s website reported.
One North Island orchard is known to be infected with the
disease and a second adjacent one has been quarantined.  It’s unclear whether PSA has spread “beyond possible
eradication,” the report cited the ministry’s deputy director-
general of Biosecurity as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
