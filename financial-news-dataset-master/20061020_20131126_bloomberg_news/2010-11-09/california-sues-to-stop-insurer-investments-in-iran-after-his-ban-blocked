California’s insurance regulator sued
to stop insurers from investing in Iran, challenging a finding
by an administrative law office that a rule blocking companies
from doing business with Iran was “underground regulation.”  California Insurance Commissioner  Steve Poizner  says any
insurance company licensed in California shouldn’t be doing
business “in any way, with the Iranian regime,” according to a
statement today on the department’s website. The suit contests
the California Office of Administrative Law’s determination that
Poizner’s rule barring Iran investments was improper.  The case is Poizner v. American Council of Life Insurers,
California Superior Court (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
