Silver fell from the highest price in
30 years after CME Group Inc.’s Comex unit raised margin
requirements. Gold dropped from a record.  The minimum amount of cash traders must deposit when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will rise to
$6,500 per contract from $5,000 for exchange members, said
 Michael Shore , a spokesman for the exchange in Chicago. Silver
surged as much as 7 percent to $29.34 an ounce in New York
today, the highest price since March 1980, before retreating.  “The exchange wants to rein in the volatility,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“The threat of margins going up will cause people to liquidate.
They may not want to tie up as much of their money.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose $1.1474, or 5.4
percent, to settle at $28.906 an ounce at the close of floor
trading on the Comex. The most-active contract fell as much as
3.7 percent to $26.415 in after-hours trading and was at $26.82
at 4:15 p.m.  Zeman said margin selling “spilled over” to gold.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $6.90, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,410.10 an ounce. The metal climbed to
an all-time high for the fourth straight session, touching
$1,424.30. In after-hours trading, the price dropped as much as
1.5 percent to $1,382.20 and last traded at $1,390.70.  Before today, gold had rallied 28 percent this year and
silver had gained 63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
