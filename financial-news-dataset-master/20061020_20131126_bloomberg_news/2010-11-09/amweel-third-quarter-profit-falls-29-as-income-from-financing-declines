Tamweel PJSC , a United Arab Emirates
mortgage lender, posted a 29 percent drop in third-quarter
profit as income from Islamic financing and assets fell.  Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 7.3
million dirhams ($2 million) from 10.3 million dirhams a year
earlier, Tamweel said in a statement to the Dubai bourse today.  Income from Islamic financing and investing assets dropped
to 129 million dirhams from 178 million dirhams, the company
said. Operating income fell 15 percent to 165.2 million dirhams.
Tamweel’s impairment provisions were reduced to 46.6 million
dirhams from 52.6 million dirhams.  Tamweel and rival  Amlak Finance PJSC , formerly the U.A.E.’s
two biggest mortgage companies, suspended lending after the
seizure of global credit markets shut their access to funding.
 Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank that complies
with Muslim banking rules, raised its stake in Tamweel to 57
percent from 21 percent in September to help boost lending.  Tamweel expects to book 100 million dirhams of new home
loans a month when it revives lending, Chief Executive Officer
 Wasim Saifi  said in an interview in Dubai on Oct. 5.  The company’s shares were suspended from trading in
November 2008 as the U.A.E’s government worked on a plan to
restructure the company after the onset of the global credit
crisis.  Shares are expected to begin trading “soon” as the
company “has been restructured and we have returned to
profit,” Chairman  Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed Al Nehayan  said on
Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
