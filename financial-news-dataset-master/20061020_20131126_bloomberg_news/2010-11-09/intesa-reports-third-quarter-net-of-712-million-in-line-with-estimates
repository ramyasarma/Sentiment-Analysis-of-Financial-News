Intesa Sanpaolo SpA , Italy’s second-
biggest bank, said third-quarter earnings declined 24 percent on
shrinking deposit margins and lower income from trading.  Net income  fell to 510 million euros ($712 million) from
674 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based bank said in a
statement today. That’s in line with the 511 million-euro
average  estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The lender, which reported the strongest results among
Italian banks in the European stress tests in July, is shedding
assets and cutting costs to boost capital. Chief Executive
Officer  Corrado Passera  is looking at opportunities in central
and eastern Europe to strengthen the bank’s business in
countries where Italian companies are expanding.  Intesa rose 1.4 percent to 2.50 euros at 1:52 p.m. in Milan
trading, giving the bank a market value of 31.4 billion euros.
Investors viewed as positive that the company had its first
quarter-on-quarter increase in net interest income this year.  “Good ratios make Intesa a safe play” and “not in need
of any capital increases,” said  Angelo Manca , a portfolio
manager at Ockham Capital Partners in London.  Net trading in the quarter dropped to 126 million euros
from 447 million euros a year earlier, while net interest income
fell 5 percent from the year-earlier period to 2.47 billion
euros.  Net fees and commissions were unchanged at 1.3 billion
euros. Figures for the third quarter of 2009 were adjusted to
reflect the sale of Intesa’s depositary bank in December.  The core tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, was
unchanged to 7.7 percent as of Sept. 30. The company’s loan-loss
provisions declined 14 percent to 711 million euros in the
quarter. Intesa reiterated it expects  profit  to increase this
year as it cuts operating expenses and the cost of credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
