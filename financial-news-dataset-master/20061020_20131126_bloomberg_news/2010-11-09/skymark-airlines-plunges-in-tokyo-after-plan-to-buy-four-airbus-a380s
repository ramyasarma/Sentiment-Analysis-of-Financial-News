Skymark Airlines Inc. , Japan’s
biggest low-cost carrier, fell the most in five years in Tokyo
trading as some analysts said its plan to buy four Airbus SAS
A380s and begin international services raised risk.  The carrier tumbled as much as 16 percent to 793 yen, the
 biggest intraday drop  since March 2005. It was down 15 percent
at 802 yen at the 11 a.m. trading break. The shares have more
than doubled this year, compared with a 13 percent decline for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index.  The 555-seater A380s would be the first widebody planes to
join Skymark’s fleet of 15 single-aisle  Boeing Co.  737 aircraft
that seat about 150 passengers. The A380 typically seats 525 and
can carry more than 800 people. Moving into overseas services
would also put the budget carrier into competition with full-
fare rivals such as  All Nippon Airways Co ., Asia’s biggest
listed carrier by sales.  “The plunge in the shares reflects concern about the risks
Skymark faces moving into a completely different business,”
said  Satoshi Yuzaki , Tokyo-based research division chief at
Takagi Securities Co. “There are many questions, such as where
will they get the huge amount of funding needed to purchase the
planes?”  Skymark, which started service in 1998, plans to begin
flying the A380s in the fiscal year starting April 2014, the
Tokyo-based company said yesterday in a statement after the
close of trading. The four-plane order is worth 1.39 billion
euros ($1.9 billion) at Airbus list prices.  Qantas Engine Trouble  Qantas Airways Ltd. grounded its fleet of six A380s last
week after one had an engine failure on Nov. 4. Replacement
aircraft are in place and the company is working with Rolls-
Royce Group Plc to investigate the in-flight engine explosion,
Sydney-based Qantas said in an e-mailed statement today.  Skymark hasn’t decided how many classes of service will be
in the superjumbo, Kazusa Naito, a spokeswoman for the airline,
said yesterday.  Skymark now flies only economy class in Japan. Skymark’s
President  Shinichi Nishikubo  was the chairman of an Internet
service provider before buying a stake in the carrier and
becoming its largest shareholder in 2003. He owns 49 percent of
the airline.  Cost Concerns  “I have a lot of concerns” about Skymark’s plan to buy
A380s,  Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., said yesterday. “How are they going to cope if
fuel prices surge? They need pilots with completely different
licenses. It’ll cost more for maintenance. Fixed costs per seat
are going to increase.”  Skymark has been adding routes and hiring pilots as  Japan
Airlines Corp. , which filed for bankruptcy in January, slashes
service and retires its fleet of Boeing Co. 747s. Neither  All
Nippon Airways Co.  nor  Japan Airlines  has bought A380s. All
Nippon said in December 2008 it had postponed a decision on
whether to buy the A380 or Boeing’s 747 jumbo jet.  Airbus had predicted that the A380 would be ideal for Japan
because its larger capacity could help airlines increase
services despite the limited availability of landing slots at
Tokyo’s Narita airport.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. , the first
customer for the A380, flies the plane to Narita, as do Air
France and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Airbus hasn’t picked up a new
customer for the A380 since Air Austral ordered two last year
for the maximum seat configuration.  Of 286 large aircraft in Japanese fleets today, 265, or
about 93 percent, are Boeing models, with the other 21 being
Airbus planes, according to data from Ascend, a London-based
global aerospace and aviation consulting company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
