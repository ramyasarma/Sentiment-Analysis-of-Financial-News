Ferrochrome contract prices may rise
42 percent to about $1.76 a pound next year from $1.24 this year
as demand for the stainless-steel ingredient increases, said
 Heinz H. Pariser , head of Alloy Metals & Steel Market Research.  Demand may increase 7.6 percent to 8.84 million metric tons
in 2011 from an estimated 8.21 million tons this year, he said
in the copy of a  presentation  posted on Merafe Resources Ltd.’s
website today. That may widen a deficit to about 319,000 tons
from 47,000 tons in 2010, according to the documents.  Merafe expects a recovery in the ferrochrome market through
2013 on world economic growth and a shortage of new capacity in
South Africa for the “near future,” it said in a separate
presentation to shareholders. The company’s venture with  Xstrata
Plc  in South Africa is the world’s largest ferrochrome supplier.  Stainless-steel production may grow to 32.7 million tons
next year from an estimated 31.2 million tons, Pariser said.  Demand is rising in China, the largest producer. World
stainless steel production is expected to jump this quarter on
demand for fuel pipelines and petrochemical plants, the Bureau
of International Recycling said in September. Posco will boost
output at its venture in China to 1 million tons a year by 2013,
from 800,000 tons, the Korea Economic Daily reported last month.  “Ferrochrome production in the country is under threat and
probably not sustainable” as the government curbs energy use
and pollution, Pariser said. “China’s numerous small and often
outdated ferrochrome smelters account for approximately 80
percent of the country’s ferroalloy output.”  China Curbs  Some countries supplying chrome ore to China’s ferrochrome
industry are also seeking to export less of the raw material and
process more of it themselves to increase revenue. They are
“taking a more critical stand” on exports, Pariser said.  South Africa, with 72 percent of the world’s chrome ore
reserves and about half of its chromite ore output, may benefit
if it has enough generating capacity to power industry, he said.
The nation earned about $2.5 billion from local and export sales
of ferrochrome last year, according to the presentation.  World ferrochrome demand may rise 22 percent by 2013 and
capacity gain 23 percent, Pariser said. Nickel, also used in
stainless steel, may move from a deficit this year to a surplus
next year, with prices falling to about $14,250 a pound from
$21,537 a pound, according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
