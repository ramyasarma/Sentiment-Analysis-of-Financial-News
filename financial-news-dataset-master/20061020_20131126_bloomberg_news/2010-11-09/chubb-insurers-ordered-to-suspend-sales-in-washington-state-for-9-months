Chubb Corp. , the insurer of corporate
boards and high-end homes, was ordered to suspend policy sales
through six of its subsidiaries in the state of Washington for
violating rate-change laws.  Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler demanded
that six Chubb subsidiaries stop writing new coverage for nine
months beginning Nov. 18, his office said in a  statement  issued
yesterday. Chubb will appeal the suspension and a suggested fine
of $534,000, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  Mark Schussel , a Chubb spokesman, declined to comment.  Kreidler says Chubb broke Washington law by changing rates
on some policies without explanation. The Warren, New Jersey-
based insurer would still honor and renew existing policies.  “We’ve repeatedly tried to work with Chubb and its
subsidiaries to fix a number of ongoing violations of state
law,” Kreidler said in the statement. “Some of the problems
that triggered this decision have been recurring for a decade.”
A call to his office for comment wasn’t immediately returned.  The subsidiaries are Federal Insurance Co., Pacific
Indemnity Co., Great Northern Insurance Co., Executive Risk
Indemnity, Inc., Vigilant Insurance Co. and Northwestern Pacific
Indemnity Co.  “Chubb is extremely surprised and disappointed,” the
insurer said. “Chubb takes seriously its compliance obligations
and remains committed to the insurance market in the state of
Washington.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
