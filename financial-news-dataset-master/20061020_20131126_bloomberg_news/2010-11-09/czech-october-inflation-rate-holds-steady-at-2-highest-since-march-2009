The Czech inflation rate held steady
in October from the previous month at the highest level since
March 2009 on food and housing prices. The rate was below the
central bank’s forecast.  The rate  was unchanged at 2 percent, the  statistics office 
in Prague said on its website today.  Prices  fell 0.2 percent on
the month. The median estimate of 9 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for annual inflation of 2.2 percent in October,
which was also the central bank’s forecast for the month.  Price growth accelerated this year as improving demand
for exports, including Skoda Auto AS cars, helps the economy
recover from the worst recession since the end of communism two
decades ago. Inflation was also driven by an increase in the
excise tax on tobacco products from the start of the year.  Gross domestic product  rose an annual 2.4 percent in the
April-June period, the fastest in two years. The central bank
left the benchmark two-week repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75
percent on Nov. 4. The bank cut its 2011 GDP growth forecast and
pushed back the likely start of increasing interest toward the
end of next year.  The central bank  estimates  inflation will match its 2
percent target in the fourth quarter of 2011 and drop to 1.9
percent in the first three months of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
