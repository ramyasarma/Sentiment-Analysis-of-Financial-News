Parque Arauco SA, the Chilean
shopping center developer and operator, was upgraded to “buy”
from “hold” at Santiago-based brokerage Celfin Capital.  Parque Arauco may rise to 1,298 pesos by year-end 2011,
analysts  Barbara Angerstein  and  Gustavo Fingeret  wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. They cited consumer demand growth,
expansion of operations to Colombia and Peru and divestments in
Argentina as drivers for the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
