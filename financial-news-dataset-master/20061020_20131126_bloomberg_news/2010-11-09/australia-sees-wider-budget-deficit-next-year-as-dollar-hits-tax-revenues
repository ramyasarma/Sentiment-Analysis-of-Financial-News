     Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) --Australia’s budget deficit this year
and next will be wider than the government predicted before an
Aug. 21 election, as a rising exchange rate slows tax revenue
from exporters, according to a midyear economic review.  The shortfall in the fiscal year ending June 30 will be
A$41.5 billion ($41.9 billion), compared with a July estimate of
A$40.7 billion, a report released in Canberra today showed. The
deficit the following year will be A$12.3 billion, the report
showed, compared with a previous projection of A$10.4 billion.  The budget will return to surplus in 2012-13, with a $3.1
billion in excess revenue over spending, smaller than the prior
forecast for a $3.5 billion surplus, the report showed. The
Treasury also said unemployment will be lower next year than
estimated and economic growth will be stronger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
