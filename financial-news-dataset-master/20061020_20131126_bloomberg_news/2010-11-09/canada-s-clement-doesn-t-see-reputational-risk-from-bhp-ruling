Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said today he doesn’t see a risk that the country’s
reputation will be damaged by his government’s rejection of BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc.  “In fact, I think our standing is the same or better,”
Clement told reporters in Mississauga, Ontario. Every
industrialized country has a process to review foreign takeover
bids, he said, referring to the U.S., U.K. and Australia.  Clement also said Canada had an “obligation” to block the
acquisition in his ruling on Nov. 3 because there was no “net
benefit” for the country.  A final ruling will be made after the 30-day appeal period
expires in December.  BHP has “a right to make representations to us, but our
only obligation under the act is to explain our decision,”
Clement said.  Melbourne-based BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining
company, wants to take over Potash Corp., the world’s biggest
fertilizer company. It’s only the second time in about 1,600
cases that Canada has refused a foreign takeover bid since its
investment act was adopted in the 1980s.  Potash is a water-soluble form of potassium found almost
entirely in Canada, Russia and Belarus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
