Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc
can continue to ship copper from its Collahuasi venture in
northern Chile for “various weeks” during a strike by
unionized workers, a company spokeswoman said.  “We are continuing to make our operations work normally,”
Bernardita Fernandez said by telephone today. “Reports that
operations are below normal are incorrect. We can continue our
shipments for various weeks.”  The strike at Collahuasi began Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
