Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA ,
the Portuguese cement maker with operations in a dozen
countries, said profit in the third quarter rose 1.5 percent,
led by sales in Brazil.  Net income rose to 71.8 million euros ($99.6 million) from
70.7 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Revenue rose 7.5 percent to 593.3
million euros as sales in Brazil, which overtook Portugal in the
fourth quarter last year as the biggest revenue source, gained
43 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 11 percent, as Ebitda in Brazil jumped 52
percent, offsetting declines in Spain, Mozambique, South Africa
and Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
