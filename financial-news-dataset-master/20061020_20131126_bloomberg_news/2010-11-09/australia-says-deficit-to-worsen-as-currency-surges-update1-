Australia’s budget deficits will be
wider this year and next than the government predicted before an
Aug. 21 election as a rising exchange rate slows tax revenue
from exporters, the Treasury said in a midyear review.  The shortfall in the fiscal year ending June 30 will be
A$41.5 billion ($42 billion), compared with a July estimate of
A$40.7 billion, a  report  released in Canberra today showed. The
gap the following year was forecast to be A$12.3 billion,
compared with a previous projection of A$10.4 billion.  The Australian dollar’s 12.8 percent rise this year to
above parity with the U.S. currency is reducing taxes collected
on profits earned offshore, forcing Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
to weigh spending cuts to keep election pledges for an end of
deficits within three years. Today’s report showed the combined
surpluses projected for 2013 and 2014 will be about A$1.6
billion smaller than earlier estimates.  “Commodity export earnings have been particularly affected
by the recent appreciation,” the government said in its report.
“The rise in the dollar has implications for both the
Australian economy and taxation revenue.”  The Treasury forecast a return to  budget  surpluses of A$3.1
billion in 2012-13 and A$3.3 billion the following year. In July,
surpluses of A$3.5 billion were predicted for 2012-13 and A$4.5
billion for the year after.  Exchange Rate  The government based its latest economic assumptions on an
exchange rate of 98.5 U.S. cents, up from predictions in the May
budget of 90 cents.  “The Australian economy is expected to grow above trend
over the forecast horizon and, with an already tight labor
market, reach capacity within the next year or so,” today’s
report said. “Consequently, inflation is forecast to rise,”
even though a faster currency appreciation will help contain
rising prices, the report said.  The Reserve Bank of Australia raised the benchmark interest
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75 percent on Nov.
2 on expectations for stronger economic growth next year as
shipments of iron ore and coal to China stoke a jobs boom.  Government revenue was forecast to be A$319.7 billion this
fiscal year and A$355.4 billion the year after, today’s report
showed, A$3.1 billion less than the combined A$678.2 billion in
revenue for those two years predicted earlier this year.  Demand for the nation’s mineral wealth produced by
companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto Group  helped
Australia skirt recession. Treasurer Wayne Swan confirmed 
growth would accelerate, speaking at a press conference in
Canberra.  Australia’s  unemployment rate , at 5.1 percent in September,
is about  half  the level of joblessness in the U.S. The level
probably dropped to 5 percent last month, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of a Nov. 11
government report on employment.  The Australian currency traded at $1.0118 as of 1:15 p.m.
in Sydney, after reaching $1.0183 on Nov. 5, the strongest since
exchange controls were ended in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
