China will become the world’s biggest
user of electricity in 2012, overtaking the U.S., as its
economic growth is set to outperform the western world,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  China, already the world’s biggest energy user, will add
power generation equivalent to the installed capacity of the
U.S. in the next 15 years as consumption is expected to triple
between 2008 and 2035, the Paris-based organization forecasts in
its annual World Energy Outlook published today.  Global power demand will rise 2.2 percent annually from
2008 through 2035, driven mainly by China and countries in the
developing world. About 80 percent of the increase will come
from countries not part of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the IEA said.  The share of fossil fuels in global power generation is
expected to fall to 55 percent in 2035 from 68 percent in 2008
as governments and utilities worldwide boost the use of
renewables and nuclear energy to reduce global warming, the
organization said.  Coal will remain the biggest source of electricity
generation in 2035, with its share falling to 32 percent from 41
percent now, according to the IEA’s New Policy Scenario.
Natural-gas-fired generation will remain at 21 percent.  “Coal remains the cornerstone of the electricity mix
during the Outlook period,” the agency said in the report.  China, where power demand will rise 7.7 percent a year from
now until 2015, will add about 600 gigawatts of coal-fired
generation capacity in the next 25 years, IEA Chief Economist
 Fatih Birol  said today at a press conference in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
