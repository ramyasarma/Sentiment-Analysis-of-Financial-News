Taiwan Power Co., the biggest
greenhouse gas emitter on the island, plans a trial carbon-
capture program at its Taichung coal-fired station as the
government pledges to cut emissions.  The state-run utility aims to capture 10,000 metric tons of
carbon dioxide from the station, the company’s biggest, by 2014,
Chief Engineer  Tu Yueh-yuan  said in a conference in Taipei today.
The carbon may be injected into the seabed off Taiwan’s west
coast for permanent storage, she said.  The project’s success may lead to bigger programs for
Taiwan Power, known as Taipower, which generates 30 percent of
the island’s carbon dioxide. President  Ma Ying-jeou , who took
office in May 2008, has pledged to cut emissions to 2000 levels
by 2025.  “It takes time,” Tu said. “We’ll see if it can be
commercialized by 2025.”  The industrialized island releases about three times more
heat-trapping gases per person than the world average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The utility produced 83 million
tons of carbon dioxide in 2008, Tu said.  The government owns 97 percent of the utility, which
generates about 75 percent of electricity the island uses.  Coal-fired plants accounted for 39 percent of Taiwan’s
electricity production in September, compared with 29 percent
from gas units and 19 percent from atomic reactors, according to
Taipower’s website. Other sources included oil and hydropower.  To contact the reporter on the story:
