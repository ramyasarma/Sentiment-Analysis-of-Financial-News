PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, plans to resume home
repossessions with “enhanced procedures.”  Individual foreclosures have been delayed “until we are
confident that any pending documentation issues have been
resolved,” the Pittsburgh-based lender said today in a
regulatory filing. “We are currently proceeding with new
foreclosures under enhanced procedures designed as part of this
review to minimize the risk of errors.”  Attorneys general in all 50 states are investigating
foreclosure practices after court documents surfaced showing
finance-company employees have signed papers without ensuring
their accuracy.  In early October PNC said it had halted sales of foreclosed
homes for a month to examine documents used to justify
foreclosures. “Based upon our review thus far, we believe that
PNC has systems designed to ensure that no foreclosure proceeds
unless the loan is genuinely in default,” PNC said in the
filing. The average loan in foreclosure is more than one year
delinquent, the company said.  PNC shares  fell  $1.40 to $56.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock is up 6.6 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
