Flooding in Haiti from last week’s
Hurricane Tomas may trigger a “large upsurge” in cholera
cases, according to an  arm  of the World Health Organization.  Health workers in Haiti are preparing for further cases in
an outbreak that has already killed 583 and hospitalized 9,123
in 240 communities, said  Jon Andrus , deputy director for the Pan
American Health Organization, speaking in a web cast from
Washington.  The outbreak could cause new cases for as many as six years
and may spread to neighboring Dominican Republic after gaining a
“foothold” in Haiti’s river system, Andrus said. Most cases
have occurred in the Artibonite region of northwest Haiti that
wasn’t directly affected by the Jan. 12 earthquake that killed
300,000, he said.  Cholera has now spread to the capital, Port-Au-Prince,
where 73 cases have been reported, and may soon reach tent camps
that house the 1.3 million people left homeless after the quake,
Andrus said.  -- Editor: Bill Faries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
