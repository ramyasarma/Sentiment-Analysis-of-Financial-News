Shoprite Holdings Ltd. is being
probed by Zambian competition authorities, Business Day
newspaper said, citing Chilufya Sampa, the director of mergers
at the Zambia Competition Commission.   The commission has been investigating Shoprite for about a
month over allegations it threatened to stop doing business with
suppliers who also sell goods to its rival, Pick n Pay Stores
Ltd., the Johannebsurg-based newspaper said, citing Sampa.
Shoprite wasn’t aware of the investigation, Business Day said,
citing the company.    Carel Goosen, Shoprite’s deputy managing director, didn’t
immediately respond to a message left on his mobile phone by
Bloomberg.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
