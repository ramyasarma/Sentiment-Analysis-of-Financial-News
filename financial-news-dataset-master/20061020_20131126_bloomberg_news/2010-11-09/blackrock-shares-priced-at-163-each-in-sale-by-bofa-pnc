BlackRock Inc.  stakeholders Bank of
America Corp. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. sold $8.3
billion of stock in the New York-based investment firm, the
biggest public offering in the U.S. this year.  The banks, BlackRock’s two largest  investors , sold a
combined 51.1 million shares at $163 each, the company said
yesterday in a statement. The secondary offering was completed
at 3.6 percent below  BlackRock ’s closing price in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. BlackRock fell 2.4
percent, or $4, to $165.09 at 10:00 a.m. in New York.  Bank of America and PNC said last week they would offer as
many as 48.3 million shares as banks seek to reduce investments
not crucial to their main businesses. The sale was increased to
meet investor demand. BlackRock, the world’s largest money
manager, won’t receive any proceeds from the offering.  Before the sale, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America held 34 percent of BlackRock. The bank got its stake
through its acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. last year. PNC,
based in Pittsburgh, controlled 24 percent. Its stake in
BlackRock will drop to 20 percent. The company was BlackRock’s
owner before the fund manager went public in 1999.  Some of the stock sold by the banks was converted from
preferred shares.  BlackRock said Bank of America plans to sell an additional
2.45 million shares directly to an institutional investor at the
offering price. Bank of America also granted the underwriters a
30-day option to purchase an additional 5.21 million to meet
further demand. After exercising the underwriter’s over-
allotment option, also known as the green shoe, Bank of
America’s stake in BlackRock will drop to 7.1 percent.  BlackRock, whose shares have retreated from its closing
peak of $242.81 on Jan. 11, has declined 29 percent this year.  Units of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc
underwrote the deal. Barclays, based in London, owns 20 percent
of BlackRock, a stake it obtained as part of its deal to sell
its investment unit to the firm in December.  Bank of America in the past year has sold its Columbia
Management fund unit, its First Republic Bank catering to
wealthy individuals, stakes in Brazilian and Mexican banks and
about $3 billion in private-equity holdings. PNC in February
said it would sell its asset-servicing unit to Bank of New York
Mellon Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
