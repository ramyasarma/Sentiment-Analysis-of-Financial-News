Raw sugar rose for a 10th straight
session, reaching a 29-year high, on concern that India may cap
exports to boost domestic supplies after a smaller-than-expected
cane harvest. Cocoa, coffee and orange juice gained.  India, the world’s second-biggest sugar producer, may
export 1.5 million to 2 million metric tons of the sweetener,
New York-based Commodore Research & Consultancy said yesterday.
Earlier this year it predicted 3.5 million tons. Flooding in the
state of Uttar Pradesh triggered cuts to forecasts, Commodore
said.  “Further heavy rains in India are causing analysts to
restrict upward production estimates,”  Michael McDougall , a
senior vice president at Newedge USA, said in a note e-mailed
today. “There is a finite amount of time for the Indian harvest
to take place.”  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery added 1.23 cents, or
3.9 percent, to settle at 33.11 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 33.32
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since Jan.
7, 1981. The commodity has gained 23 percent this year.  Raw sugar will “fly to 35 cents in the coming days,” said
 Jonathan Bouchet , a Geneva-based trader at OTCex Group.  U.S. Sugar Output  U.S. output will total 8.23 million short tons in the year
that began Oct. 1, down 1.8 percent from 8.39 million forecast
last month, the Department of Agriculture  said  today. Production
estimates for Louisiana sugarcane and U.S. sugar beets were
lowered.  Production numbers were “bullish based on trader’s
expectations, said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld
Futures in Tampa, Florida.  The U.S. will import 2.74 million tons, 21 percent more
than was previously forecast, the agency said.  In London, refined sugar for March delivery gained for the
sixth time in seven sessions, climbing $24.40, or 3.1 percent,
to settle at $802.70 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe, after touching
$810.10, the highest level for a most-active contract since at
least January 1989, when Bloomberg began recording data.  Robusta coffee rose to the highest price in more than two
years on speculation that adverse weather may delay crop
collection in Vietnam, the world’s second-largest grower. The
harvest, which usually starts in November, may be delayed by
rains in the Central Highlands,  Andrea Thompson , an analyst at
CoffeeNetwork in Belfast, Northern Ireland, said yesterday.  Coffee Rises  Robusta-coffee futures for January delivery climbed $14, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2,060 a ton on NYSE Liffe, after
reaching $2,098, the highest price since Sept. 29, 2008.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for December delivery,
the contract closest to expiration, added 8.95 cents, or 4.3
percent, to settle at $2.1705 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $2.1785, the highest level since June 1997. The March
contract, which has the most open interest, advanced 9.05 cents,
or 4.3 percent, to settle at $2.1975 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery gained $56, or 2 percent,
to settle at $2,884 a ton in New York. In London, the chocolate
ingredient for December delivery advanced 44 pounds, or 2.4
percent, to settle at 1,873 pounds ($3,002) a ton in London.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 6.25 cents,
or 4 percent, to settle at $1.615 a pound on ICE, after falling
in the previous three sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
