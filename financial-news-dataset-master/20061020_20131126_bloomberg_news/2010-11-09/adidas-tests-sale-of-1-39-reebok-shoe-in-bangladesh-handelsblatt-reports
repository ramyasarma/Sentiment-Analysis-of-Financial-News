Adidas AG  has been trying out sales
of a cheap shoe in Bangladesh in an effort to boost its social
responsibility image and test new markets, Handelsblatt
reported, citing an unidentified company spokesman.  Adidas offered 5,000 shoes of a Reebok brand model for the
price of 80 to 120 Bangladesh Taka ($1.14 to $1.70) which were
sold out in three days, the newspaper said. The newly developed
sandal will now be altered to bring product costs below the
sales price, according to Handelsblatt.  The sale was part of Adidas’ plan to develop a 1 Euro
($1.39) shoe to explore consumer behavior in poor countries that
may turn into future markets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
