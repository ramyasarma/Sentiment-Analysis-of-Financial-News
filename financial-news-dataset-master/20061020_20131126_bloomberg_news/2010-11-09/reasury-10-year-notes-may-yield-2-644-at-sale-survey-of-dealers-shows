The Treasury Department’s $24 billion
sale of 10-year notes may draw a yield of 2.644 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in November 2020, yielded 2.65
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Last month’s offering of 10-year notes, on Oct. 13, drew a
yield of 2.475 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The
securities yielded 2.67 percent at the September auction.  The October sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.99,
versus 3.21 at the September auction and an average of 3.14 for
the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 41.5 percent of the notes at the
October offering. The average for the past 10 sales is 40.6
percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.7 percent of
the notes at the October sale, compared with 6.9 percent the
previous month and an average of 14.1 percent at the past 10
auctions.  Ten-year notes have returned 14.2 percent this year,
compared with a 8.7 percent gain by the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. is selling $72 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 0.575 percent and is scheduled to sell $16 billion of
30-year securities tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
