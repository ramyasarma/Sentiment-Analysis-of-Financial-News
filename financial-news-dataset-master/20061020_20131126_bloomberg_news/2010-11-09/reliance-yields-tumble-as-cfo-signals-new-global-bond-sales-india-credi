Reliance Industries Ltd.  bondholders
are shrugging off signals by the energy company that it will add
more debt and are instead focusing on the potential for rising
oil prices to bolster its creditworthiness.  Yields dropped in the past month on six of eight actively
traded dollar-denominated notes issued by India’s biggest
company by market capitalization. The rate on its 4.25 percent
debt due in 2020 has fallen six basis points since Oct. 31, when
Chief Financial Officer  Alok Agarwal  said he will “most likely
follow” last month’s $1.5 billion bond sale with more issuance.  Reliance will be able to use revenue from its energy
business to repay debt after oil prices climbed 6 percent in the
past month to $87 a barrel, according to Mumbai-based JM
Financial Institutional Securities. Reliance’s refineries turn
low-quality crude into gasoline and diesel in a nation whose
economy the International Monetary Fund says will grow 9.7
percent this year, the fastest among major markets after China.  “Reliance’s bonds are an India-play,”  Scott Bennett , the
regional head of credit in Singapore at Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc, which oversees about $260 billion globally, said
in an interview on Nov. 8. “‘The company has a strong credit
profile and its bonds are still a little bit cheap.”  Overseas Expansion  Reliance Chairman  Mukesh Ambani , India’s richest man and
the owner of the country’s largest natural gas field, has shown
he is ready to lead the company in overseas acquisitions to
create a global energy group. Reliance paid $943 million to buy
three shale-gas assets in the U.S. this year and agreed to spend
$2.5 billion in future drilling costs on behalf of its partners.  “Demand growth is in Asia and we should plan for more than
50 percent of our transportation fuels going to this part of the
world,” Agarwal said on an Oct. 31 conference call with
reporters. “Airlines are full and demand for aviation fuel is
improving across Asia, across the world.”  Demand for cars in India has risen more than 30 percent
this year and may double to 3 million vehicles annually by 2015,
according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
 Reliance  refined 33.8 million metric tons of crude oil in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, operating its two refineries at 109
percent of capacity. That’s up from 27.6 million a year earlier.  India has sought $2.96 billion in loans from the World Bank
to convert single-lane highways into two-lane roads, Junior
Roads Minister R.P.N. Singh said in a written reply in the lower
house of parliament in New Delhi yesterday.  ‘Viewed Favorably’  “Reliance’s new debt would be viewed favorably by
investors,”  Mehul Thanawala , an analyst at JM Financial, said
in an interview on Nov. 8. “Reliance should be generating close
to $5 billion of cash flows every year.”  The  yield  on India’s benchmark 10-year rupee bond rose
three basis points today to 8.06 percent, bringing this year’s
increase to 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage point. The
 difference  between the yield and that of similar maturity U.S.
Treasuries was 539 basis points.  India’s rupee appreciated 0.1 percent today to 44.30 per
dollar, Bloomberg data show. The currency has fluctuated between
43.9750 and 44.8725 since the end of September, after gaining
from its weakest level this year of 47.7450 to the dollar in
May.  In the corporate bond market, the  difference  in yield
between India’s top-rated five-year rupee company debt and
similar-maturity government bonds expanded to 66.4 basis points
from 65.4. The gap has shrunk from 86 at the start of the year.  Default Swaps  The cost to protect against a default by State Bank of
India, a state-owned lender that is a proxy for sovereign debt,
has fallen 21 basis points to 161 basis points since Oct. 1,
according to New York-based data provider CMA’s credit-default
swaps prices.  The cost of protecting Reliance’s five-year debt fell to
164 on Nov. 9 from 165.7 on Oct. 1. Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements. A basis point equals $1,000 a year on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt for five years.  This year’s 5 percent advance in the rupee makes it cheaper
for companies that raise funds in dollars to repay loans.
Dollar-denominated debt offerings by Indian companies have more
than tripled this year to $7.5 billion, making it easier to buy
and sell the nation’s securities, according to Aberdeen Asset
Management Asia Ltd.  ‘Very Attractive’  Interest rates outside the country are “very attractive,”
Reliance’s Agarwal told reporters on Oct. 31. The London
interbank offered rate for three month loans in dollars was set
at 0.286 percent yesterday, down from 5.725 percent in September
2007 before global credit markets seized up, according to the
British Bankers’ Association.  “The offshore market allows Reliance to borrow at very low
yields and to sell longer-dated bonds,” Aberdeen’s Bennett
said.  The yield on Reliance’s 8.25 percent bonds maturing in 2027
declined 95 basis points in the past month to 5.82 percent,
while the 9.375 percent debt due in 2026 dropped 60 basis points
to 5.94 percent.  Reliance’s  net income  in the three months ended Sept. 30
rose 28 percent to 49.2 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) from a
year earlier, according to a statement filed on Oct. 30. That
was the best quarter since 2007 for Reliance, which operates the
world’s largest oil-refining complex, located in the western
Indian state of Gujarat.  Rising Debt  The company had 681.98 billion rupees of  debt  outstanding
as of Sept. 30, up from 624.95 billion on March 31. Cash from
operations in the year ended March 31 was 191.63 billion rupees,
25.5 percent higher than a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash flow may be 330 billion rupees in the year ending
March 31,  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R. Choksey
Shares & Securities Pvt., which manages $124 million in assets,
said in an interview yesterday. S&P gave Reliance a BBB rating,
one level above the firm’s rating for India, on Nov. 23, 2005.  “We don’t have any major concerns regarding their debt-
servicing abilities,” Mehul P Sukkawala, a Mumbai-based credit
analyst at Standard & Poor’s, said in an interview yesterday.
“They have large cash flows from petrochemicals, refinery and
exploration businesses.”  Crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange has
risen 10 percent this year, reaching a high of $87.63 a barrel
on Nov. 9. It will sell at $92.50 a barrel in 2012, according to
the median forecast of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Austria-based Erste Bank estimates the fuel will cost $189 a
barrel then.  “As crude prices increase, Reliance can sell oil products
whose prices are benchmarked to high-quality crude,”  Deepak Pareek , an analyst at Mumbai-based Angel Broking Ltd., said in
an interview yesterday. “They procure cheaper-quality crude and
sell higher-quality products, increasing their refining
margins.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
