The U.S. stock rally may stall as the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , which has gained in nine of the
past 10 weeks, nears a level seen as resistance by analysts who
follow the Fibonacci system to forecast stock prices, according
to Instinet Group Inc.  The S&P 500 last week rose to within two points of
1,228.74, which represents a 61.8 percent recovery of the entire
loss during the 2007-2009 bear market. While the advance since
the end of August has pushed the benchmark above its previous
2010 intraday high of 1,220 posted in April and the average
during the past 200 weeks of 1,192, the index may struggle in
the short term as it tests that Fibonacci level, according to
John Schlitz, Instinet’s chief market technician.  “We’re being cautious about committing new money,”
Schlitz said in a telephone interview from his office in New
York. “We’re stretched, and keep getting away with being
stretched because all the bad things we thought were going to
happen just don’t pan out so far.”  The benchmark last approached the 61.8 percent retracement
level when it closed at 1,217.28 on April 23, before plunging as
much as 16 percent on concern that U.S. unemployment and
widening budget deficits in Europe will derail global growth.  Fibonacci analysts use a system pioneered by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa that assumes asset prices will
follow patterns based on proportions found in nature. The system
says that stocks tend to recoup all their losses after erasing a
61.8 percent decline.  S&P 500 Rally  The S&P 500 has rallied 17 percent since the end of August
as  earnings  per share have topped estimates at 76 percent of the
416 companies in the S&P 500 that have announced results since
Oct. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and as the
Federal Reserve said it would bolster economic growth by
purchasing $600 billion of assets.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for the benchmark
yesterday exceeded 70 for a fourth day, the longest streak since
April 15 -- one week before the S&P 500’s previous 2010 peak.
RSI identifies possible turning points by measuring the degree
by which gains and losses outpace each other. Readings of 70 or
more are considered evidence that an index may decline. Such
“overbought” conditions make the rally vulnerable, Schlitz
said.  “We’re still riding the uptrend, because nothing tells us
not to,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we couldn’t have a pretty
sharp, short-term correction if some negatives hit.”  To contact the reporter on this story;
