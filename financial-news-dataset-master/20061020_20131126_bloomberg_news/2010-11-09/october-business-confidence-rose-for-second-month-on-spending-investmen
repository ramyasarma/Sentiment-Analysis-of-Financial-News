French business confidence rose for a
second month in October as improved consumer spending and
investment help lift demand.  The  Bank of France’s Business Sentiment Indicator  for
manufacturers increased to 103 from 102 in September, the
central bank said in a statement today. Economists expected a
reading of 102, the median of five forecasts gathered by
Bloomberg showed.  Today’s report reflects a shift from export-led growth to
reviving consumer demand. Household spending jumped 1.5 percent
in September as companies such as BNP Paribas SA and cosmetics
maker  L’Oreal SA  resume hiring.  Confidence is being supported by the “investment-cycle
recovery,” said  Pierre-Olivier Beffy , chief economist at Exane
BNP Paribas in Paris. “The improvement in the employment
outlook could also benefit consumer-goods manufacturers.”  The Bank of France also gave its first forecast for fourth-
quarter growth, saying the French economy is set to expand 0.5
percent in the final three months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
