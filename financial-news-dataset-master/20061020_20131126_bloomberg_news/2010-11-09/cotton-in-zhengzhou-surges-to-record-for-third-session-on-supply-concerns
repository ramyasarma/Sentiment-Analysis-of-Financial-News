Cotton futures in Zhengzhou jumped to
a record for a third day on speculation that a smaller harvest
in China, the world’s biggest buyer and consumer, may push the
nation’s imports higher and drain global supply.  Cotton for May delivery gained 1.7 percent to 33,515 yuan
($5019) a metric ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange,
before trading at 33,285 yuan at 9:03 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
