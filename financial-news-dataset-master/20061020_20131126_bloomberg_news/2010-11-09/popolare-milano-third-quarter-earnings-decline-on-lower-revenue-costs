Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl , the
oldest Italian cooperative bank, said third-quarter profit fell
34 percent on lower revenue and higher costs.  Net income declined to 37.7 million euros ($52 million)
from 57 million euros a year earlier, the lender said in a
stock-exchange statement today. The bank was expected to earn 27
million euros in the period, according to the  average estimate 
of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Popolare Milano is cutting costs and raising money by
selling bonds and non-strategic assets to boost finances after
the global financial crisis. The Milan-based bank, which
received 500 million euros of government aid last year, isn’t
planning a capital increase, General manager  Fiorenzo Dalu  told
Corriere della Sera in an interview on Nov. 8.  Net interest income in the third quarter declined 10
percent to 185 million euros, while loan-loss provisions were
unchanged at 49 million euros. The core Tier 1 capital ratio, a
key measure of a bank’s financial strength, was 7.4 percent at
the end of the quarter.  Operating costs rose 5 percent in the period to 290 million
euros.  Popolare Milano rose 0.6 percent to 3.25 euros in Milan,
giving the company a market value of about 1.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
