Senegal  may sell its first Islamic
bond, known as sukuk, with involvement from  Citigroup Inc. , a
Finance Ministry spokesman said.  “We are working on this, but it’s not yet for sure,” said
Ousmane Gueye in an interview in Dakar, the capital. He declined
to provide details about the offer’s date, value or specifically
say how Citigroup is involved.  The West African nation, whose population is about 94
percent Muslim, is considering the bond to strengthen ties with
investors and governments in the Middle East, said Birahim Seck,
chief executive officer of Dakar-based  SYM International Finance
Corp. , which advises Middle Eastern investors in Africa. The
funds raised may be used for improvements in roads and energy,
he said.  “This bond is going to happen very soon,” Seck said in a
phone interview today. “Middle Eastern companies want to invest
in West Africa, but they need a channel.”  Senegal is currently selling 75 billion CFA francs ($157.8
million) of five-year bonds, Gueye said Oct. 27. That offer will
close Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
