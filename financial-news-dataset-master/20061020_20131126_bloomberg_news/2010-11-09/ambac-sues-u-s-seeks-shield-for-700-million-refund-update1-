Ambac Financial Group Inc. , a
bankrupt holding company for the bond insurer, filed an
adversary lawsuit against the U.S. in Manhattan bankruptcy court
today, seeking a shield for a $700 million tax refund.  Ambac seeks an injunction that will temporarily bar the
Internal Revenue Service from seizing the refund, which Ambac
received from carrying back losses on credit default swap
contracts. It also seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no
tax liability for 2003 to 2008, and is entitled to keep the full
refund.  The IRS issued a document request to Ambac on Oct. 28,
seeking information about Ambac’s accounting methods on the
refund, and said it may recoup the payment, lawyers for Ambac
said in the court filing.  “Should the IRS take steps to seize the Tax Refunds before
the adjudication of the IRS entitlement (or lack of entitlement)
thereto AFG’s ability to reorganize successfully will be
jeopardized or destroyed,” lawyers for Ambac wrote.  Ambac,  the holding company of Ambac Assurance Corp., which
is being restructured by state regulators in Wisconsin, filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy yesterday with  liabilities  of $1.68
billion as of June 30 on an unconsolidated basis.  The holding company case is In re Ambac Financial Group
Inc., 10-15973, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
