Parque Arauco SA , the Chilean
shopping center developer, rose to a record in Santiago trading
after brokerage firm Celfin Capital upgraded the stock to
“buy” from “hold,” citing increasing consumption.  Parque Arauco  increased 4.2 percent to 1,175 pesos at 10:50
a.m. New York time, and earlier advanced 4.6 percent, the
largest intraday rise in a week. The  IPSA index  climbed 0.5
percent to 5,027.33.  The developer may rise to 1,298 pesos by the end of 2011,
up 15 percent from its Nov. 8 closing price, as consumer demand
increases and the company expands in Colombia and Peru, Celfin
analysts  Barbara Angerstein  and  Gustavo Fingeret  wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. Parque Arauco will also see less
volatility after selling its Argentine operations, they said.  “We see Parque Arauco as a safe exposure to the Andean
consumption sector,” Angerstein and Fingeret said.  They raised their forecast for earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization this year and next,
predicting increases of 30 percent next year and 9.3 percent in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
