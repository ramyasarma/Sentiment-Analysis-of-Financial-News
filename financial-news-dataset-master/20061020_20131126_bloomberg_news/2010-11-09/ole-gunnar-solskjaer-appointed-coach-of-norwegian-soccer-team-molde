Former Manchester United striker  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  was named manager of Molde soccer club in
Norway.  Solskjaer spent the past two seasons as the reserve team
manager at Manchester United. The 37-year-old began his playing
career with Molde in 1995 before joining United.  Solskjaer had 126 goals in 11 seasons at United before
being forced to retire in 2007 because of a knee injury. He came
off the bench to score the winning goal in stoppage time of the
1999 Champions League final as United rallied to beat Bayern
Munich 2-1.  “I think that his career as an outstanding professional
footballer gives him a foundation to get into coaching,” United
manager  Alex Ferguson  said in a  statement  on the Premier League
club’s website. “He’s had a great introduction with our
reserves and this is the right time for Ole to take up his first
managerial position.”  Solskjaer replaces Uwe Rosler at Molde, which finished 11th
out of 16 teams in Norway’s top division this season. He’ll
officially take over on Jan. 10, Molde said in a  statement  on
its website, ahead of the new season starting in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
