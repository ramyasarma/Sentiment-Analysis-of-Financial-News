revenue in Europe, sank 4.2 percent. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
largest oil and gas explorer, retreated 2.2 percent after oil
prices dropped today.  “The yen’s strengthening to the 80 yen level is probably
having a psychological affect on investors,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $104 billion. “Since there’s no other
catalyst for the stock market today, investors care about even
small movements in the currency.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.4 percent to 9,694.49
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix slid 0.2 percent to
839.95 after rising as much as 0.2 percent before the yen’s

the biggest drag in the Nikkei 225, followed by Kyocera Corp.  Electronics Makers  U.S. stocks fell yesterday, dragging benchmark gauges down
from two-year highs, as a five-week rally left the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index at the highest valuation since May and concerns
over Irish debt curbed demand for riskier assets. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  lost 0.3 percent yesterday, after rising for
six straight days.  “Investors are taking profits today prompted by the Dow’s
slump yesterday,”  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund manager in Tokyo who
helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  Electronics makers were the heaviest drag on the Topix

18 months.  Mitsui & Co., a trading house that counts commodities as
its biggest source of profit, fell 1 percent to 1,338 yen and
