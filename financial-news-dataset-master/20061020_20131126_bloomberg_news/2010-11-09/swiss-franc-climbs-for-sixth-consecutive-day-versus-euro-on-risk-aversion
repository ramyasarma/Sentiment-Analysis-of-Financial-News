The Swiss franc advanced for a sixth
consecutive day against the euro as investors sought a haven
from debt-market tension in peripheral euro-region nations.  Switzerland’s currency rose to the strongest in almost
three weeks against the euro as 10-year bond yields in Ireland
and Portugal climbed to records relative to benchmark German
bunds. The franc also gained against the dollar, even as a
report showed Swiss  consumer confidence  unexpectedly fell.  “The franc’s strength is coming from selling the euro as a
hedge against the risk in the periphery,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a
foreign-exchange strategist at UBS AG in London.  The franc appreciated 0.6 percent to 1.3366 per euro as of
5:04 p.m. in London after earlier reaching 1.3325, the strongest
since Oct. 20. It gained 0.2 percent, to 96.38 centimes per
dollar.  The Irish 10-year bond yield rose to a record 554 basis
points, or 5.54 percentage points, above the bund yield. The
 Portuguese-German yield spread  widened as much as 13 basis
points to 452 basis points, also a record.  Swiss consumer confidence fell to 7 in October from 16 in
September, according to the State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs in Bern. Economists had forecast an increase to 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
