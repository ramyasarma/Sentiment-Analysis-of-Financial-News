Harvard, the richest U.S. university,
sold $601 million in tax-exempt bonds with yields falling below
top-rated general obligations at every maturity, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bonds maturing in January 2020, and not eligible to be
bought back by the school, were priced to yield 2.54 percent.
That’s 0.20 percentage point below AAA  10-year  muni debt,
according to Municipal Market Advisors, an independent research
firm based in Concord, Massachusetts.  “Harvard is almost in a class of its own,”  Alan Schankel ,
director of fixed-income research for Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. “It’s so
high-quality, and I still think there’s a lot of muni credit-
worthiness fears out there.”  The bonds, sold today through the Massachusetts Development
Finance Agency, will refinance long-term debt and pay
construction costs related to the Fogg art museum renovation
project. The issue was marketed by underwriters led by  Morgan
Stanley .  The offering follows Harvard’s $300 million sale last week
of taxable 30-year bonds at a coupon of 4.875 percent, its
lowest borrowing cost for that maturity, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Harvard’s previous taxable-debt sale was
in December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
