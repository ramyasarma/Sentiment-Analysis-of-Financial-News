PGE SA, Poland’s largest utility, has
rejected preliminary bids from Netia SA and GTS Central Europe
for Exatel SA, the phone company PGE plans to sell this year,
the newspaper Puls Biznesu reported today, citing Netia Chief
Executive Officer Miroslaw Godlewski and GTS Central Europe CEO
Adam Sawicki.  Polkomtel SA, Poland’s largest mobile phone operator, and
Mediatel SA, majority owned by Warsaw-based investment fund NFI
Magna Polonia, were picked by PGE for further talks on sale of
the Exatel stake, Puls Biznesu reported, citing an unidentified
