Flooding across more than half of  Thailand , the world’s largest rice exporter, may damage 11
percent of the nation’s rice plantation and lower output from
the main crop by 3.9 percent, the Farm Ministry said.  About 7.56 million rai (2.99 million acres) are estimated
to have been damaged in the country’s worst floods in five
decades. Production from the nation’s main crop, which
represents about 72 percent of total output, will probably fall
to 22.34 million metric tons, the Farm Ministry said in a
statement.  Output from last year’s main crop was 23.25 million tons,
according to the Agricultural Economics Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
