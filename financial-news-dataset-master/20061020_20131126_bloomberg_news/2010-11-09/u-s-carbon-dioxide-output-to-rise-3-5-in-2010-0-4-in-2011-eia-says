U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from
oil, coal and natural gas will climb 3.5 percent this year,
according to a forecast by the Energy Information
Administration.  Carbon dioxide output from energy use is expected to rise
0.4 percent in 2011 from 2010, the EIA said today in its
November  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Projected economic growth this year of 2.6 percent and
“increased use of coal and natural gas” by power plants and
factories are driving carbon dioxide emissions up, the EIA said.  Next year, power plants are predicted to burn less fossil
fuel, the EIA said. Still, demand in the transportation sector
for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel will rise enough in 2011 to
“show a small increase” in carbon dioxide output, the EIA
said.  The EIA predicts U.S. gross domestic product will rise by
2.2 percent next year, up from last month’s growth estimate of
2.1 percent. Its 2010 estimate for economic growth is unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
