Brazil’s monetary council may approve
this month new rules for fees that credit card companies may
charge consumers, Justice Minister  Luiz Paulo Barreto  told
reporters today in Brasilia.  The three-member council, comprised of the planning
minister, finance minister and the central bank’s president, may
reduce the number of fees paid by consumers on their credit
cards to no more than 14 from around 40 today, said  Paulo Caffarelli , president of Brazil’s credit card industry group,
speaking after Barreto.  Retail banks that issue debit and credit cards also
committed to increased transparency in billing statements and to
provide a copy of the contract when a new card is requested,
Caffarelli said. Banks also agreed not to send cards to clients
without prior consent, he said.  “We’re not against regulation,” Caffarelli said. “We
believe self regulation is a good way forward.”  Brazil is implementing an overhaul of credit card
regulation after a study by the central bank last year concluded
that profits are above “fair” levels. After tackling fees, the
government may propose additional legislation, Barreto said.  The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.6970 per dollar at 10:51
