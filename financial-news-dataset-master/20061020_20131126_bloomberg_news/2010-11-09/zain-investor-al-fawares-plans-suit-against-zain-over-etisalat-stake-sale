Al-Fawares Holding Co. said it will
file a lawsuit against Mobile Telecommunications Co. and its
board for allowing Emirates Telecommunications Corp. to conduct
due diligence on the Kuwaiti phone operator without presenting
the purchase offer, according to an advertisement in  Al-Watan 
newspaper today.  Mobile Telecommunications, known as  Zain , and its board
also approved opening the books to Emirates Telecommunications,
known as Etisalat, “without checking the sincerity of the offer
to purchase 51 percent of Zain, the price, the terms and
guarantees,” Al-Fawares said in the advertisement. Al-Fawares
described itself as a main shareholder in Zain.  Zain’s board approved a request by Al-Khair National for
Stocks and Real Estate Co. to conduct due diligence for a
possible stake sale to Etisalat, Zain announced yesterday. Al-
Khair is owned by Kuwait’s Kharafi Group, Zain’s second-largest
shareholder which is leading the stake sale.  The decision by Zain’s board contravenes its responsibility
to protect shareholders’ rights, Al-Fawares said in the
advertisement. It also cautioned against “any mishandling of
Zain’s assets, especially its stake in Zain Saudi Arabia.”  The deal is subject to a number of conditions, including
the disposal of Zain’s shareholding in Zain Saudi Arabia, Al-
Khair said Nov. 3 after signing a preliminary agreement with
Etisalat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
