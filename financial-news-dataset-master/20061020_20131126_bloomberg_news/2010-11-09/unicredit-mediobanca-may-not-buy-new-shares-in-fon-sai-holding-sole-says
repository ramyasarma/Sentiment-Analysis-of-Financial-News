UniCredit SpA may not take
part in a capital increase for Premafin Finanziaria SpA, the
company that controls insurer Fondiaria-Sai SpA, daily Il Sole
24 Ore reported, without saying where it got the information.  Mediobanca SpA, which controls Fon-Sai’s larger rival
Assicurazioni Generali SpA, may also not take part because of
antitrust concerns, according to the Italian newspaper.  Foreign banks may prefer to buy shares in Fon-Sai rather
than the holding company, Sole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
