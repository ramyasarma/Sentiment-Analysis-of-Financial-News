Wheat futures rose a fourth day to
the highest in seven weeks on expectations the U.S. Department
of Agriculture will lower its estimate of global supply.  The December-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.1
percent to $7.445 a bushel, the highest price since Sept. 20, on
the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading at $7.425 at 1:56 p.m.
Singapore time.  World inventories of wheat may decline to 173.53 million
metric tons before the 2011 harvest, according to the average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That’s down
from 196.53 million tons a year earlier, and the USDA estimate
of 174.66 million tons in October. The agency will update its
estimate today at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  “The focus of the market today and tonight is certainly
going to be the USDA report,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said by phone from
Sydney today. “On the global ending stocks, there’s a little
bit of uncertainty around the number.”  The condition of the U.S. winter-wheat crop deteriorated
last week because of dry weather in the Great Plains. About 45
percent of  winter wheat  was rated good or excellent as of Nov. 7,
down from 46 percent a week earlier and 63 percent a year
earlier, the USDA said yesterday.  About 95 percent of the crop was planted in 18 states,
mostly in the Midwest and Great Plains, compared with 92 percent
a week earlier and 86 percent a year earlier.  ‘Winter Kill’  Because of the dryness, plants have not been able to
establish strong root systems, leaving them vulnerable to
“winter kill,”  David Streit , an agricultural meteorologist at
the Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland said. A
strong cold air mass in the sub-zero range would make the crop
more susceptible to “dying out,” he said.  March-delivery corn gained 1 percent to $6.05 a bushel in
Chicago, while January-delivery soybeans climbed 0.7 percent to
$12.83 a bushel.  Rough-rice for January delivery rallied as much as 2
percent $15.55 per 100 pounds, the highest for the most active
contract in Chicago since Dec. 17.  Flooding across more than half of Thailand, the world’s
largest rice exporter, may damage 11 percent of the nation’s
rice plantation and lower output from the main crop by 3.9
percent, the farm ministry said today.  About 7.56 million rai (2.99 million acres) are estimated
to have been damaged in the country’s worst floods in five
decades. Production from the nation’s main crop, which
represents about 72 percent of total output, will probably fall
to 22.34 million tons, the farm ministry said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
