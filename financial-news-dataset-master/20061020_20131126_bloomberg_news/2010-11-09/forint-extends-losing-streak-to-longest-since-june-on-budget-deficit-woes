The Hungarian forint weakened for a
sixth day, its longest losing streak since June 29, after the
government yesterday said the budget deficit reached 131 percent
of the full-year target at the end of October.  The forint lost 0.4 percent to 275.75 per euro by 9:58 a.m.
in Budapest, the worst performance among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It has lost 1.9 percent
since Nov. 1.  Hungary, which needed an international bailout to avert
default in 2008, is working to meet European Union-imposed
budget-deficit targets this year and next. A  shortfall  in
October was unexpected, BNP Paribas SA analysts lead by  Shahin Vallee  in London wrote in a note to clients today.  The forint “has been underperforming its peers lately not
least because of yesterday’s release of year-to-date budget
data,” the BNP Paribas analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
