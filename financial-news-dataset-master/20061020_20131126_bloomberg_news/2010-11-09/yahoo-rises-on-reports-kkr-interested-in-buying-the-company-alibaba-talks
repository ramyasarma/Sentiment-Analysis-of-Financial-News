Yahoo! Inc. , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, climbed 3.2 percent in Nasdaq trading on a
report that KKR & Co. is joining a list of buyout firms that
want to take the company private.  KKR is interested in helping finance a transaction, the New
York Post reported today, citing unidentified people. Private-
equity investors approached  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which is
40 percent owned by Yahoo, about taking Yahoo private, Reuters
reported, also citing people familiar with the matter.  Yahoo had lost half its value since Microsoft Corp., the
world’s largest software maker, withdrew a $44.6 billion bid in
2008, and sales haven’t grown much under Chief Executive Officer
 Carol Bartz  amid rivalry with Google Inc. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is working with Yahoo to help field takeover approaches,
people with knowledge of the situation said last month.  Yahoo  climbed 53 cents to $16.97 at 4 p.m. New York time on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, after rising to $17.60 earlier, the
biggest increase in almost four weeks. The shares have risen 1.1
percent this year.  Yahoo has not been approached by any private equity groups,
Dow Jones Newswires reported, citing a source close to the
company.  Kristi Huller , a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment,
as did Alibaba spokesman  John Spelich .  Dana Lengkeek , a
spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
