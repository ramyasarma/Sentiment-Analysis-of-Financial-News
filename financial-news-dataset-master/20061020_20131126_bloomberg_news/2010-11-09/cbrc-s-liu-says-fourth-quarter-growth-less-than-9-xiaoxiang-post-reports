Liu Mingkang, head of China’s
banking regulator, said the nation’s economic growth this
quarter may be less than 9 percent, the Xiaoxiang Morning Post
reported today.  Annual economic growth may be between 9.8 percent and 10.2
percent, according to the report, citing remarks Liu, chairman
of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, made at a government
seminar yesterday attended by local officials from Hunan
province, where the newspaper is based.  The Chinese currency’s appreciation since June has put
great pressure on exports, Liu was cited as saying. The
government’s property measures have cooled property transaction,
Liu was cited as saying. Home price may not see large gains or
declines, the newspaper reported, citing Liu.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
