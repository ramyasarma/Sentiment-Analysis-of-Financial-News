Cargolux Airlines International SA,
Europe’s third-biggest air-freight carrier, said it was fined
79.9 million euros ($111 million) by European Union regulators
for fixing air-cargo prices.  Luxembourg-based Cargolux and “a number of other airlines
were fined by the European Commission” today, Thomas Hempel, a
spokesman for the closely held company, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Cargolux,  Air France-KLM Group ,  British Airways Plc ,  SAS
Group AB  and 22 other airlines received complaints from EU
regulators almost three years ago, following coordinated
antitrust raids across the world that have led to jail terms for
some executives, fines and settlements. U.S. authorities have
already fined 18 airlines at least $1.6 billion and filed
criminal charges against 14 executives for price-fixing.  Under EU rules, companies can be fined 10 percent of annual
sales for antitrust violations. The commission typically opts
for a penalty of about 2 percent to 3 percent of sales in cartel
cases. Companies may appeal to EU courts.  Spokespeople for Air France, British Airways and SAS Group,
owner of Scandinavian Airlines, all declined to comment ahead of
a commission announcement scheduled for today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
