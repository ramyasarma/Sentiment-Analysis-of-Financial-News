Argentine corn and soybean production
may be disrupted this year as a La Nina weather system
potentially brings dry weather, ETF Securities said.  La Nina had the greatest effect in the past in the form of
“drier conditions in Argentina,” Daniel Wills, a senior
analyst at ETF Securities in London, said today in an e-mailed
report. Dryness and a lack of transportation infrastructure in
the country may cause corn and soybean prices to be volatile, he
said.  “Coupled with infrastructure bottlenecks, agriculture
markets are currently characterized by higher supply uncertainty
and price volatility than in previous seasons,” Wills said.
“These potential disruptions take on added significance as
global inventories in some agricultural commodities” decline
worldwide, he said.  A La Nina system is characterized by colder-than-normal
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and usually causes lower-than-
normal rainfall in Argentina and dry weather in the U.S. and
Brazil. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of corn,
followed by Argentina and Brazil.  Corn for March delivery rose 6 cents, or 1 percent, to
$6.0525 a bushel at 8:47 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Soybeans for January delivery gained 8.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $12.835 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
