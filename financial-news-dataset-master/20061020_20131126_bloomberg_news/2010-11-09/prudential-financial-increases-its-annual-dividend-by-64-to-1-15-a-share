Prudential Financial Inc.  and
 Allstate Corp.  are returning cash to shareholders as insurers
rebound from the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.  Prudential, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer, boosted
the annual dividend 64 percent to $1.15 a share, its highest
payout since 2007. Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, said
it will repurchase $1 billion in shares by March 31, 2012.  Prudential and Allstate returned to profitability in 2009
after posting losses the year before as the credit crunch
hobbled equity markets and reduced demand for insurance. Newark,
New Jersey-based Prudential halved its dividend in 2008 from
$1.15 in 2007 and Allstate suspended buybacks.  “Allstate is exceptionally well-capitalized,” Chief
Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson  said yesterday in a statement
announcing the buyback. “As a result, we can resume providing
additional cash returns to shareholders.”  Prudential  climbed 51 cents to $55.40 in extended New York
trading after the announcement yesterday, and has advanced about
10 percent this year. Allstate rose 37 cents to $30.65, and is
little changed in 2010. The  KBW Insurance Index , which tracks 24
insurers including Prudential and Allstate, has gained about 18
percent this year.  The  dividend  is payable on Dec. 17 to shareholders of
record as of Nov. 23, Prudential said. The insurer last boosted
the  dividend  by 12 cents to 70 cents in November 2009. The new
payout gives shares an indicated yield of 2.1 percent, according
to Bloomberg data.  MetLife Inc. , the biggest U.S. life insurer,
has an indicated yield of 1.8 percent.  Confidence  “This increase returns the dividend to the 2007 level,”
Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld  said. The payout
“demonstrates our confidence in the company’s capital position
and future earnings power.”  Prudential posted its seventh straight  profit  in the third
quarter on gains in the annuities business tied to rising equity
markets. It returned to profitability last year after a $1.1
billion loss in 2008.  Prudential agreed Sept. 30 to buy two Japanese life
insurance companies from  American International Group Inc.  for
$4.8 billion. Strangfeld bolstered liquidity at the end of 2009
by selling a stake in a brokerage venture for $4.5 billion.  The insurer was upgraded by Fitch Ratings Nov. 3 on
improved earnings and investment results. The upgrade “reflects
the significant steps the group has taken to reduce its reliance
on short-term debt, reduce overall leverage, and strengthen
overall liquidity,” Fitch said.  Allstate, the largest publicly traded home and auto
insurer, posted losses totaling $1.7 billion in 2008. Since
then, it has reported six consecutive profitable quarters.  Third-quarter profit rose 66 percent as investment losses
narrowed. Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was 83 cents a share, missing the 96-cent average
estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
