Assets at the  New York State  pension
fund, the third largest in the U.S., expanded to $132.8 billion
at Sept. 30 as the value of investments grew 8 percent on rising
prices for equities, Comptroller  Thomas P. DiNapoli  said.  “Our commitment to long-term value investing through our
diversified portfolio has kept the fund secure and well
positioned to benefit from the markets’ continued recovery,”
DiNapoli said in a statement today. The fund’s return on
investments was 26 percent in the year ended March 31, 2010,
according to its annual report.  The New York fund has assets equal to more than 100 percent
of its liabilities, according to its annual report. The fully
funded status of the plan assumes that state and local
governments make future contributions at whatever level the
comptroller determines is necessary.  The 8 percent gain in the fiscal second quarter exceeds the
7.5 percent annual rate the pension assumes when calculating the
contributions required by the state and local government
employers. Because of a 26 percent loss in the year ended March
31, 2009, required contributions in February 2012 are set at
16.3 percent of payroll, more than double the rate two years
earlier.  Rising prices for equities boosted the fund, DiNapoli said.
The pension holds 39 percent of its assets in U.S. stocks and 16
percent in equity from other countries. About 27 percent of the
plan’s assets are in bonds or cash, 10 percent in private
equity, 4.5 percent in real estate, 2.8 percent in hedge funds,
and 0.5 percent in what it calls “opportunistic strategies,”
according to the  comptroller .  Comparable Returns  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 index  rose 10.7 percent in the
three months ended Sept. 30. The Financial Times world  index 
rose 13.8 percent in the same period.  The New York Common Retirement Fund, which covers about 1
million current and retired workers of the state and local
governments, grew from $124.8 billion at June 30.  The fund’s investment performance lagged behind other
retirement plans with more than $5 billion of assets in recent
years, according to its  annual report  and data compiled by the
consulting firm  Wilshire Associates . Its average return of 4.16
percent in the five years ended March 31, 2010, was below the
median 4.51 percent of other large plans, according to Santa
Monica, California-based Wilshire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
