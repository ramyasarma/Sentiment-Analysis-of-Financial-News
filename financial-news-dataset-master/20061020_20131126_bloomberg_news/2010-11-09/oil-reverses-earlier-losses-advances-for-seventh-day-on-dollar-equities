Oil reversed earlier losses as rising
equities and a weakening dollar tempered concern that excess
crude supplies are growing in the U.S., the world’s largest oil
consumer.  Crude for December delivery gained 29 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $87.35 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It had earlier dropped as much as 62
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $86.44.  To contact the reporter on this story:
