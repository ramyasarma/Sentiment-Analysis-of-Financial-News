Automatic Systems Ltd., a Mauritian
company that operates betting-systems for horse racing and
soccer matches, said three-month post-tax profit fell to 10.97
million rupees in the the period ended Sept. 30 from 13.17
million rupees the year earlier.  The company’s revenue fell to 419.58 million rupees from
507 million rupees the year earlier, it said in a statement to
the stock exchange in Port Louis today. An interim dividend of 5
rupees will be paid, down from 7 rupees last year.  “The difficult economic situation, which is having an
adverse effect on the gambling industry added to the strong
competition, the increase in football betting tax from 2% to 8%,
the restriction on advertising and limited coverage of live
racing on TV continue to affect our revenue and profit,” the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
