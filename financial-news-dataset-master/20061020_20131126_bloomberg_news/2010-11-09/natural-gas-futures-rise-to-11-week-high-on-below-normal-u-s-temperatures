Natural gas futures rose to the
highest level in more than 11 weeks on speculation that lower-
than-normal temperatures in the U.S. will boost demand for the
heating fuel.  Gas gained 3 percent as forecasts showed temperatures will
be below average across much of the nation from Nov. 14 to Nov.
22, according to the National Weather Service. About 52 percent
of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  “Weather is turning cold, so people start to get a little
bit jittery and gas prices go up,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an
analyst in Houston at Canaccord Genuity Inc. “Weather is
probably the main driver behind the price move recently.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 12.2 cents to settle
at $4.21 per million Btu on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the highest settlement since Aug. 18.  There will be “widespread” cold weather in the U.S. East
and Midwest beginning Nov. 14, according to Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Chicago will have a low of 22 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-6
Celsius) on Nov. 19, 10 degrees below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. New York will
have a low of 37 degrees.  Demand for the heating and power-plant fuel, which peaks
during the cold-weather months, drove gas to $6.108 on Jan. 7,
still the 52-week high.  The number of  U.S. gas drilling rigs  fell 12 to 955 in the
week ended Nov. 5, the lowest level since the week ended June
18, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count is 30 percent
higher than a year ago.  Record High Stockpiles Expected  The Energy Department is expected to report that  gas
stockpiles  increased by 23 billion cubic feet to 3.844 trillion,
surpassing the current record of 3.837 trillion set in November
2009, according to the median of 13 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  The department will release the weekly data tomorrow at
noon, one day earlier than usual due to the Veterans Day
holiday.  “Temperatures are dropping and that gives bulls a little
more momentum, but overall there are still some serious
fundamental headwinds,” said  Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke
Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky.
“Storage continues to make upside difficult.”  Production Forecast Grows  Gas production will average 61.49 billion cubic feet a day
this year, up from 61.29 billion estimated in October, the
Energy Department said in its  monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook 
today.  Consumption will average 65 billion cubic feet a day, down
from 65.16 billion estimated in October.  Benchmark gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana will average
$4.35 per million British thermal units, down from October’s
estimate of $4.47, according to the department.  Henry Hub gas prices will be $4.31 next year, down 5.9
percent from October’s estimate of $4.58.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 26.88 cents, or 7.7 percent, to $3.7629 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange, the biggest gain
since Jan. 7.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
301,045 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
268,000. Volume was 331,453 yesterday. Open interest was 819,003
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 813,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
