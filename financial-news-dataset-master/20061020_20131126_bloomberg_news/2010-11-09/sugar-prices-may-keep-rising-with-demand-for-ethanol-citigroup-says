Sugar prices may keep rising on
demand to make ethanol, Citigroup Inc. said.  Production of ethanol, made from sugar cane, “is on the
increase, and by using sugar cane as the most cost-effective
feeder stock, this may continue to force sugar prices upward,”
Citigroup analyst Marcelle Jankelow wrote in a report dated
today. Even after sugar prices at a 29-year high, “tight supply
changes look set to continue squeezing the commodity in the near
term,” Jankelow wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
