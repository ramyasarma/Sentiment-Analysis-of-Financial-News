Allstate Corp. , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, approved a $1 billion share
buyback program as Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson  called
the company “exceptionally well-capitalized.”  The repurchases will happen through the open market and be
completed by the end of March 2012, the Northbrook, Illinois-
based insurer said today in a statement.  “We can resume providing additional cash returns to
shareholders,” Wilson said. The insurer has about $15.1 billion
of statutory capital at insurance subsidiaries and $3.5 billion
of holding company investments, he said.  Allstate, which gets the largest portion of  revenue  from
auto insurance and sells most policies through agents, is
competing for customers with Progressive Corp. and  Warren Buffett ’s Geico Corp., which increased Internet and phone sales.
Third-quarter net income climbed to $367 million, or 68 cents a
share, from $221 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, as
investment losses narrowed.  The insurer’s board also  maintained  a 20-cents-a-share
dividend payable on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
