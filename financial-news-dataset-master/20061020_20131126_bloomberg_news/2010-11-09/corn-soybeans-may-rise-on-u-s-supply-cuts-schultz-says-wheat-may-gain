Corn futures may open 15 cents to 20
cents a bushel higher after the government said U.S. farmers
will harvest a smaller crop than forecast last month and world
inventories will fall, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Soybean futures may open 40 cents to 50 cents a bushel
higher after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reduced its
forecast of domestic inventories more than expected, Schultz
said. Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel
higher on shrinking global inventories, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
