U.S. cotton output will be 2.4
percent smaller than forecast a month ago after crops in
Texas were damaged by adverse weather, the government said.  Production  will total 18.42 million bales in the
season that ends July 31, down from the 18.87 million
projected in October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said today in a report. That’s 51 percent more than the
12.19 million bales harvested last season. Ten analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News were expecting 18.92 million
bales.  “Crop conditions in Texas gradually eased from mid-
July through the end of October,”  Gary Raines , an
economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville,
Tennessee, said in a note before the report. “We are more
cautious on yield prospects than earlier this season.”  Cotton futures for March delivery rose 4.42 cents, or
3.12 percent, to $1.4653 a pound at 8:42 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price has more than doubled
in the past year on shrinking global supplies and increased
demand from mills in China, the biggest user.  Texas Yields  Yields in Texas, the largest producing state, may
total 739 pounds an acre, down 6.7 percent from 792 pounds
estimated last month, the USDA said. Last year, yields
averaged 635 pounds.  A hailstorm in Texas damaged unharvested crops last
month. As of Nov. 7, 60 percent of the crop in Texas and 71
percent of all U.S. cotton was harvested, according to the
USDA.  The U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may ship 15.75
million bales this year, up from last month’s forecast of
15.5 million, the USDA said. That compares with 12 million
bales last season.  “Chinese mills maintain their ravenous hunger for
fiber,”  Gary Raines , an economist at FCStone Fibers &
Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a note before the
report. They “will turn to the U.S.” to fill their import
needs, he said.  U.S. stockpiles  at the end of this marketing year will
be 2.2 million bales, down from last month’s estimate of
2.7 million, according to the report. Inventories at the
end of last season totaled 2.95 million bales.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  World output  will be 115.25 million bales, down from
last month’s forecast of 116.68 million, as China’s
production may fall 4.8 percent to 30 million. Global use
will be 116.82 million bales, down from the October
projection of 120.77 million, the USDA said. World ending
stocks will fall to 42.2 million bales, from the previous
estimate of 44.66 million, the agency said.  The government will update its supply and demand
forecasts on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
