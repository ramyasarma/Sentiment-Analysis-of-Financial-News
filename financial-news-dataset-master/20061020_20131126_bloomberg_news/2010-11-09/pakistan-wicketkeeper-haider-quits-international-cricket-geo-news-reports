Pakistan cricketer Zulqarnain Haider,
who went missing from his team’s Dubai hotel on Nov. 8,
announced his retirement from the international game, Pakistan’s
Geo News reported.  Wicketkeeper Haider fled a one-day series against South
Africa in Dubai and traveled to the U.K. amid reports he’d been
approached by match-fixers.  He told Geo News he was receiving threats from an unknown
person and decided to leave Dubai immediately and go to London
where he is seeking asylum, the news organization added.  The U.K.’s Home Office told Bloomberg News it doesn’t
comment on individual cases.  Yesterday, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, High Commissioner of
Pakistan to the U.K., said Haider would be given “any consular
assistance that he requires.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
