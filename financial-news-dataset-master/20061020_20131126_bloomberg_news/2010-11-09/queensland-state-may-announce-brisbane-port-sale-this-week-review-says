The state of Queensland may announce
the winner of the Port of Brisbane sale as early as this week,
the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street talk
column, without saying where it got the information.  The likely buyer is a group including Global Infrastructure

of just under A$2 billion ($2 billion), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
