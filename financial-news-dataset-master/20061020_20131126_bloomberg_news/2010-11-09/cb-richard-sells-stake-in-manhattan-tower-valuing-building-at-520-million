A fund sponsored by  CB Richard Ellis
Group Inc.  sold a 49 percent stake in 1540 Broadway, a tower in
Manhattan’s Times Square, to HSBC Alternative Investments Ltd.
and Edge Fund Advisers as New York property demand increases.  The interest was sold based on a building value of $520
million, or about $575 a square foot, Los Angeles-based CB
Richard Ellis Investors said in a statement today. The developer
bought the office portion of the skyscraper in March 2009 for
$355 million, according to  Real Capital Analytics Inc.   “The value of this asset has gone up 50 percent in less
than 18 months,” said  Dan Fasulo , managing director of Real
Capital, a New York-based research company. “This displays how
much values have recovered in Manhattan, especially for well-
located, class A office buildings.”  Trading volume of Manhattan office properties rose 23
percent to $3.18 billion in the third quarter from a year
earlier, according to Real Capital. The average price per square
foot was $383, compared with a U.S. average of $196.  CBRE Investors bought 1540 Broadway from Deutsche Bank AG,
which had taken it over from developer  Harry Macklowe  after he
was unable to refinance about $7 billion debt from acquisitions.
The purchase was on behalf of a real estate fund raised from
institutional investors in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.  Higher Occupancy  The 907,427 square-foot (84,303 square-meter) building was
78 percent occupied at the time of the sale. It is now about 85
percent leased after renovations to the lobby and the addition
of new suites, CBRE Investors said.  “1540 Broadway has been a major turnaround story and a
success story for not just our fund investors but also for the
Midtown Manhattan office market,”  Vance Maddocks , president of
CBRE Strategic Partners U.S., said in the statement.  Pam Barnett, a CBRE Investors spokeswoman, said in a
telephone interview that the sale was for a 49 percent interest
in the property.  Remaining vacancy includes a block of 74,000 square feet
between the 42nd and 44th floors, CBRE said. The company said it
plans to add more suites, without specifying how many.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
