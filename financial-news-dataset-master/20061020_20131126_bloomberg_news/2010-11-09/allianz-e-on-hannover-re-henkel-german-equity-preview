German stocks retreated from a two-
year high as declines by carmakers and banking shares outweighed
gains by Henkel AG and E.ON AG.  Deutsche Bank AG fell 2.3 percent, its first drop in five
days. Roth & Rau AG sank 11 percent after reporting a decline in
nine-month earnings before interest and taxes. Henkel jumped 9.8
percent, climbing the most in the DAX Index, as the maker of
Loctite glues increased its forecast for full-year profit and
said third-quarter net income almost doubled.  The DAX  fell 1 percent to 6,719.84 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt. The measure increased 2.3 percent last week as the
U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it will buy a further $600
billion of bonds in an attempt to bolster the world’s largest
economy. The broader  HDAX Index  also declined 1 percent today.  Government data due for release in China tomorrow will show
that inflation accelerated to 4 percent in October, according to
the  median estimate  of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That
would be the fastest pace in two years. The government’s full-
year inflation target is 3 percent.  “There seems to be speculation in the market that
tomorrow’s Chinese CPI print could come out hotter-than-expected
at 4.4 percent, which would certainly increase market concerns
of further tightening measures in China,” said  Ben Potter , a
Melbourne-based research analyst at IG Markets Ltd.  China’s central bank will increase the reserve ratio
requirement for the nation’s banks by 50 basis points from Nov.
16, according to a statement posted on the People’s Bank of
China’s website today.  Deutsche Bank Drops  Deutsche Bank, the country’s biggest bank, slipped 2.3
percent to 40.96 euros, ending the longest winning streak since
September. Smaller competitor Commerzbank AG lost 2.6 percent to
6.13 euros.  Banks  from UniCredit SpA to Natixis SA reported a
drop in third-quarter profit today.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG lost 2.1 percent
to 53.75 euros and 1.7 percent to 49.18 euros, respectively.
European carmakers declined 2 percent today, the worst
performance among 19 industry groups in the benchmark  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index .  Roth & Rau sank 11 percent to 14.80 euros, the lowest price
in 20 months. The maker of equipment used to coat solar panels
said nine-month EBIT was 3 million euros ($4.1 million) compared
with 13.1 million euros in the same period in 2009.  Fraport AG  lost 2.7 percent to 45.54 euros as the owner of
Frankfurt airport was downgraded to “underperform” from
“buy” at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.  Henkel, Hannover Re Gain  Henkel surged 9.8 percent to 46.17 euros, the biggest
advance in almost two years. Net income jumped 96 percent to 337
million euros, or 78 cents a preferred share, from 172 million
euros, or 39 cents, a year earlier, Dusseldorf-based Henkel said
today in a statement. That beat the 283 million-euro  average
estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company
forecast that earnings per preferred share will climb more than
45 percent compared with its previous prediction of a 25 percent
increase.  Hannover Re climbed 3.2 percent to 37.89 euros, the first
advance this week. The world’s third-biggest reinsurer raised
its full-year earnings forecast after quarterly profit rose 66
percent, boosted by a one-off tax gain.  Third-quarter net income increased to 271 million euros
from 163 million euros a year earlier, the company said. That
beat the 252 million-euro  average estimate  of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  E.ON jumped 2.2 percent to 22.68 euros as Germany’s largest
utility said nine-month adjusted net income gained 2 percent as
cost cuts in the U.K. boosted earnings and it sold energy at
higher prices in the Nordic region.  The profit gauge used to calculate dividends increased to
4.4 billion euros, the company said today in a statement handed
out in Dusseldorf. E.ON failed to supply year-earlier figures in
the statement. Sales gained 11 percent to about 64 billion
euros, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
