U.S. commercial property transactions
will increase as much as 40 percent in 2011 from this year as
the economy expands, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc .  Buyers and sellers will complete about $92 billion of deals
for apartment, office, industrial and retail properties this
year, Jones Lang said today on a conference call discussing its
real estate outlook. The Chicago-based company is the country’s
second-biggest publicly traded commercial property broker,
behind  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.  of Los Angeles.  Apartment and office building sales have been the most
active in 2010, according to Jones Lang. Transactions will
increase next year as U.S. gross domestic product grows 2
percent to 2.5 percent, the company said.  “Investors will begin taking on more risk,” said Josh
Gelormini, director of capital markets research at Jones Lang.  Apartment buildings will remain attractive as new
construction remains limited, Gelormini said. Investors are
taking advantage of financing involvement from Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac to fund multifamily deals, he said.  Rents in the downtown markets of major cities are starting
to rise, said John Sikaitis, Jones Lang’s director of office
research. Suburban markets in areas including Philadelphia,
Atlanta, Dallas and Chicago may remain stagnant, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
