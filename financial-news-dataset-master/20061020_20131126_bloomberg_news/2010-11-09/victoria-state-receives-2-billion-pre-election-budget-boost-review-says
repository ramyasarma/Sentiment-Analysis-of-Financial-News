Victoria received a A$2 billion ($2
billion) boost in revenue as the state recovered from the global
slowdown, the Australian Financial Review reported, citing a
pre-election budget update released yesterday from the
Department of Treasury and Finance under caretaker provisions
before an election on Nov. 27.  Increased taxes, administrative variations and federal
grants were the main contributors to the rise, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
