The United Arab Emirates will require
Canadian visitors to apply for visas after an aviation dispute
between the two countries over landing rights for commercial
flights.  The new regulations will go into effect on Jan. 2, the
U.A.E. Embassy in Ottawa said in a statement on its  website ,
without providing any details. Currently, Canadians don’t
require visas to enter the country.  U.A.E. carriers including Emirates have been seeking dozens
of new landing slots in Canada, contending that the six weekly
flights currently allowed are not enough to meet demand.
 Transport Canada , the government agency that oversees the
airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots on
concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada’s traffic
to cities such as Frankfurt.  The U.A.E. is the largest trade partner with Canada in the
Middle East and North Africa, with more than $1.5 billion of
business in 2008, according to U.A.E. government figures. As
many as 27,000 Canadians live in the U.A.E. today.  Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade said on Oct. 12 that Canadian troops based in the U.A.E.
will be relocated. Camp Mirage, a military logistics camp near
Dubai, serves as a jump-off point for Canadian forces in
Afghanistan.  Last month, Waterloo, Canada-based Research In Motion Ltd.
averted a ban on its BlackBerry smartphone in the U.A.E., after
the country’s phone regulator said the company’s messaging
services now comply with local security regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
