Investors should sell the euro
against the Swiss franc at 1.355 in the expectation it will
decline to 1.29, according to UBS AG.  UBS previously recommended entering the trade at 1.3870,
 Beat Siegenthaler , a currency strategist in Zurich, wrote in a
research note today.  “The cross has moved in our direction on the back of
eurozone peripheral issues intensifying and the franc benefiting
as the safe haven of choice,” he said. “We expect this move to
continue, but choose to eliminate any downside risks to our
trade.”  The franc strengthened 0.8 percent to 1.334 per euro as of
8:45 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
