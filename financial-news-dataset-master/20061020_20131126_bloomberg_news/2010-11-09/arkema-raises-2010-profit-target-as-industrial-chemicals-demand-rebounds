Arkema SA , the French chemical maker
spun off from Total SA, raised its annual earnings forecast for
the third time in 2010 as growth in Asia, an acquisition and
price increases boosted third-quarter sales 41 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, which more than doubled in the third quarter, will
be roughly 740 million euros ($1.02 billion) in 2010,
representing about 12.5 percent of sales, Arkema said today in a
statement. The company, based in Colombes near Paris, previously
 predicted  Ebitda of more than 600 million euros this year, up
from 310 million euros in 2009.  “Arkema reports its best historical quarterly
performance,” Chief Executive Officer  Thierry Le Henaff  said in
the statement. “This reflects Arkema’s successful repositioning
in emerging countries and in tomorrow’s technologies, in
particular renewable energies and high performance polymers,”
and the purchase of the acrylics business from Dow Chemical Co.  Arkema aims to lift its Ebitda  margin  to at least 13.5
percent of revenue in 2014 from 7 percent in 2009 by making
between a third and half of its investment in Asia, and boosting
revenue from chemicals used for rechargeable batteries, solar
panels and water treatment. The CEO has said the company may buy
companies to expand faster in acrylics, technical polymers and
sulfur chemicals, and trim costs at its vinyl unit that serves
the construction market.  Profit Beats Estimates  Third-quarter net income was 130 million euros, compared
with a loss of 3 million euros a year earlier. It beat the
average 78 million-euro  estimate  from five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Ebitda surged to 246 million euros, or 15.8 percent
of sales, from 101 million euros.  Revenue rose to 1.56 billion euros, helped by the purchase
of acrylics assets from Dow Chemical in January, plant openings
in emerging markets, price increases and exchange-rate
fluctuations.  French competitor  Rhodia SA  forecast on Nov. 4 that
recurring Ebitda, which excludes reorganization costs, may
increase to about 900 million euros, 85 percent higher than last
year’s 487 million euros.  Arkema has  gained  84 percent this year in Paris trading,
giving the manufacturer a market  value  of 2.93 billion euros.
 Rhodia  has risen 74 percent in 2010, valuing the company at
2.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
