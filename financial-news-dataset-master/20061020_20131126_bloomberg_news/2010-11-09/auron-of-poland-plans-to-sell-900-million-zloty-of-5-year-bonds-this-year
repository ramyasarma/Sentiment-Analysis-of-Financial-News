Tauron Polska Energia SA, Poland’s

five-year bonds in late November or early December to refinance
debt, Chief Financial Officer Krzysztof Zawadzki told reporters

400 million-zloty bond program, the CFO said, declining to name
the banks that it hired to organize the financing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
