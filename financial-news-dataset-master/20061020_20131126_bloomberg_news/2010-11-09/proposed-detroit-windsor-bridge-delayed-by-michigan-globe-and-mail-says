The $5.3 billion plan to build a new
bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario has hit a snag after
a key vote on the trade gateway was delayed by the Michigan
Senate, the Globe and Mail reported.  The delay could push back final approval on the bridge for
months, the  newspaper  said.  The bridge would relieve heavy congestion along the Canada-
U.S. border and create “tens of thousands” of jobs in the
region, the Globe said. The newspaper said 40 percent of all
truck traffic between Canada and the U.S. crosses at the
Windsor-Detroit border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
