Southern Sudan plans to build three
new oil refineries if the region decides to secede from Sudan
next year following an independence referendum, Energy and
Mining Undersecretary David Loro told reporters today in Juba,
the capital.  In May, the Akon Refinery Co., a joint venture between
Khartoum-based Eyat Oilfield Co. and Southern Sudan’s state-
owned Nile Petroleum Co., announced a tender for bids to build a
50,000 barrel per day refinery. The cost of the project is
estimated at $1.8 billion, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
