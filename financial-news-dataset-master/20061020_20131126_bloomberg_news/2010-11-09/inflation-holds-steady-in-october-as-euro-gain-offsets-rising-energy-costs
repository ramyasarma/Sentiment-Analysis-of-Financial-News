Inflation  in Germany, Europe’s
largest economy, held steady in October as an appreciating euro
helped offset rising energy prices.  The inflation rate, calculated using to a harmonized
European method, remained at 1.3 percent for a second month, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said, confirming an
initial estimate published on Oct. 27. Prices rose 0.1 percent
in the month.  The euro has risen 16 percent against the dollar since
early June, helping counter higher prices for imports such as
oil, which has risen 22 percent in the same period. Bundesbank
President  Axel Weber  said last month that inflation in Germany
should remain “very moderate.”  “We do not see any major inflation development in Germany
over the next three years unless there is an oil-price shock,”
said Costa Brunner, an economist at Natixis in Frankfurt. “The
euro has been exerting downward pressure on inflation.”  On a non-harmonized basis, consumer prices rose 1.3 percent
from a year earlier, the statistics office said. In the month,
prices rose 0.1 percent.  In the 16-nation euro region,  inflation  unexpectedly
accelerated to 1.9 percent in October from 1.8 percent in
September. The European Central Bank aims to keep the rate just
under 2 percent over the medium term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
