Peru’s imports jumped 37 percent last
month as rising private investment fuelled demand for capital
goods and construction materials, the government said.  Imports rose to $2.78 billion in October, compared with
$2.03 billion in the same month a year earlier, said state tax
and import duty collection agency  Sunat  in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
