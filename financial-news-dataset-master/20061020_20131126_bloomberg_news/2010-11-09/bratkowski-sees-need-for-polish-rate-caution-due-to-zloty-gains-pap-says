It is now “too late” for Poland’s
central bank to increase interest rates by a half-point to head
off rising inflation and policy makers should adopt a policy of
“gradual” tightening as the economy recovers, Monetary Policy
Council member Andrzej Bratkowski was quoted today as saying in
an interview with PAP newswire.  Bratkowski said the zloty is more likely to strengthen on
capital inflows after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a new
round of quantitive easing, PAP reported.  “That’s why I believe we should be cautious and that
monetary policy should not lead in the short term to a
significant, strong appreciation of the zloty,” Bratkowski was
quoted as saying by PAP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
