Hochtief AG  may use a convertible
bond program as a weapon in its fight against a takeover bid by
Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, Handelsblatt
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The program would make the bid more expensive for ACS
because it would have effects similar to those of a capital
increase, the newspaper said. Some Hochtief executives have
doubts about the strategy of fighting the bid and favor
negotiations with ACS, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
