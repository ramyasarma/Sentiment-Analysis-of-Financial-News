Spain led a surge in the cost of
insuring European government debt to a record on concern the
region’s peripheral nations will struggle to cut budget deficits
and repay debt.  Credit-default swaps on Spanish government bonds jumped
10.5 basis points to 275.5, an all-time high based on closing
prices, according to data provider CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments climbed 2.5
basis points to 179.5.  Investors are shunning Europe’s most indebted nations,
driving borrowing costs and swaps higher for an 11th consecutive
day. Confidence in Spain is ebbing after its central bank
estimated the economy stagnated from July to September after
emerging from recession in the first quarter.  “Spain is getting carried along with the general weakness
in peripherals,” said  Nick Burns , a London-based credit
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.  Credit-default swaps on Portugal increased 6 basis points
to 473.5 and Ireland climbed 3 to 602, both records based on
closing prices. Italy was up 5 at 204 and Greece was 3 basis
points higher at 871, CMA prices show.  Sovereign debt concerns drove swaps on European bank bonds
to the highest levels in six weeks. The Markit iTraxx Financial
Index linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose
1.5 basis points to 141, and the subordinated index increased 2
basis points to 216.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  ‘Sovereign Weakness’  “Sovereign weakness has weighed most heavily on
financials, in particular peripheral banks,”  Zoso Davies , a
credit strategist at Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a note
to investors.  Credit-default swaps on the senior debt of Allied Irish
Banks Plc rose 17.5 basis points to a record 927 and Bank of
Ireland Plc jumped 16.5 basis points to a record 739, CMA prices
show.  Contracts on the subordinated debt of Anglo Irish Bank
Corp. increased 1.7 percentage points to 77.5 percent upfront
and 5 percent a year. That means it costs 7.75 million euros in
advance and 500,000 euros annually to insure 10 million euros of
the bank’s debt for five years.  The difference in yield, or spread, between 10-year Irish
bonds and similar-maturity bunds widened to a record 553 basis
points, or 5.53 percentage points. Portuguese 10-year bonds
fell, pushing the yield 20 basis points higher to 7.02 percent.
That’s the highest on record, according to Bloomberg generic
data. The Portuguese-German 10-year yield spread widened 16
basis points to 449 basis points, the most ever.  Funding Costs  “These funding costs that you’re seeing right now are
clearly not sustainable for countries that are not going to grow
that fast for some years,”  Erik Nielsen , chief European
economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday on
Bloomberg Television’s “Midday Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .
“There is a big probability the Irish and the Portuguese will
end up having to get help from” policy makers, he said.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds also rose. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of swaps linked to 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 1.25 basis points to 102, the
highest level since Oct. 7. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of
50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 1 to
445. The index traded at a six-month low on Nov. 5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. an increase
