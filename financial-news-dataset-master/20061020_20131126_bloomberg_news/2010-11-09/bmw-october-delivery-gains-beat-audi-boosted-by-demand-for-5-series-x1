Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s
namesake brand, the world’s best-selling luxury vehicle marque,
outpaced sales growth by Volkswagen AG’s Audi last month on
demand for the revamped 5-Series and new X1 compact sport-
utility vehicle.  BMW brand sales rose 12 percent, to 107,789 cars.
Deliveries including Mini and Rolls-Royce vehicles rose 12
percent in October to 128,593 cars and sport-utility vehicles,
the Munich-based company said today in a statement. The growth
rate beat Audi, even as it trailed Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz
brand.  “Our new models continue to report strong gains in October
and made a positive contribution to our sales performance,” Ian
Robertson, BMW’s sales chief, said in the statement. “Based on
the steady recovery of many markets, we continue to expect
double-digit sales growth through the end of the year.”  Luxury vehicle demand is bouncing back from the financial
crisis on a rebound in the U.S. and growth in China. BMW is
targeting 1.4 million vehicle sales, a rise of about 10 percent
from a year earlier. Reaching that goal would give BMW its
third-highest annual sales total.  Deliveries of the 5-Series surged 55 percent to 23,810
vehicles last month, while BMW sold 10,162 X1s, which was
introduced late last year, the company said in the statement.  Gains in newer models were tempered by declines in the
ageing 1-Series compact and 3-Series small sedan. Sales of the
1-Series fell 20 percent to 15,464, and the 3-Series slipped 4.3
percent to 34,785, BMW spokesman  Jan Ehlen  said by phone.  Luxury Leader  Audi, which aims to overtake BMW as the luxury leader by
2015, recorded 5.8 percent growth in October sales to 87,600.
The A1 subcompact and A7 four-door coupe will likely boost sales
in the coming months,  Peter Schwarzenbauer , the VW unit’s sales
chief, said in a statement yesterday.  The Mercedes brand, the number-two luxury make, posted a 14
percent advance in deliveries to 100,500 vehicles last month on
demand for upgraded R-Class and CL models. Including the Smart
city-car brand, which slumped 15 percent, Daimler’s car sales
rose 11 percent to 108,400, the company said Nov. 5.  Through October, Audi’s sales grew faster than its main
competitors, rising 16.4 percent to 916,900 vehicles. Deliveries
at the Mercedes brand climbed 15.5 percent to 954,400, while the
BMW make rose 14.6 percent to 1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
