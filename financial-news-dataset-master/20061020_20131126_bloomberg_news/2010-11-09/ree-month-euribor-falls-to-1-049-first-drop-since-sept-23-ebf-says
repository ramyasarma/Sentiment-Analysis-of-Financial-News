The rate that banks see each other
paying for three-month loans in euros fell for the first time
since Sept. 23.  The euro interbank offered rate, or  Euribor , for such loans
declined less than one basis point to 1.049 percent, the
European Banking Federation said. It was at 1.05 percent
yesterday, equal to the most since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
