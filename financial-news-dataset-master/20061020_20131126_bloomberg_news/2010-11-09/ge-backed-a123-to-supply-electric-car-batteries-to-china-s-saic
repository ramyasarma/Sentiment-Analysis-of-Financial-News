A123 Systems Inc. , a maker of
rechargeable auto batteries, will supply lithium-ion cells to
 SAIC Motor Corp.  for use in an electric vehicle as the U.S.
startup expands ties with China’s largest domestic carmaker.  Cells made by A123, part-owned by  General Electric Co. ,
will be integrated into battery packs for Shanghai-based SAIC at
Advanced Traction Battery Systems Co., the companies’ joint
venture, A123 said in a statement. The car, due in 2012, will
have range of about 100 miles between charges, said  Jason Forcier , vice president of A123’s automotive group. The battery
maker didn’t say how many vehicles will be built.  “I can’t give you a specific figure, but the number is
significant,”  David Vieau , A123’s chief executive officer, said
in an interview late yesterday. “This is not a ‘build just 200
cars’ kind of thing.”  The U.S. battery maker aims to boost business in China
further after previously announcing plans to supply cells for
SAIC’s Roewe 750 hybrid and Roewe 550 plug-in hybrid sedans.
China, the world’s largest auto market, is offering buyers of
plug-in hybrids and electric cars subsidies of as much as 60,000
yuan ($9,000) to help cut pollution and reduce oil dependency.  A123 rose 3 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $9.94 yesterday in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares have fallen 56
percent this year.  SAIC  fell 3.4 percent to 20.28 yuan yesterday
in Shanghai, trimming its gain this year to 0.9 percent.  Biggest Market  China will be the biggest market for electric vehicles
“for a couple of reasons,” Vieau said.  “The government’s stated commitment is strongest,” he
said. Additionally, “because it’s an evolving market, consumers
don’t have a fixed set of expectations. They don’t have an
expectation that a vehicle must travel 400 miles. For many, a
vehicle with 100 miles of range is sufficient.”  Chinese government officials estimate electric-vehicle
production in the country may reach 1 million units a year by
2020, A123 said. China will have as many as 20,000 plug-in
hybrids and electric cars by 2013,  Wan Gang , China’s minister
for science and technology, said  last week .  Others estimate demand will grow more slowly. Researcher
J.D. Power & Associates forecasts that Chinese consumers may buy
432,000 plug-in hybrid or electric vehicles in 2020, out of a
total of 5.2 million globally.  China Production  Electric and hybrid vehicles may account for 7.3 percent of
global auto sales by 2020, or 5.2 million units, and China will
account for less than 9 percent of the total plug-in hybrid and
electric car demand by 2020, according to J.D. Power.  A123, based in Watertown, Massachusetts, will initially
ship cells made at its battery factory in Michigan for the
electric car, before a China production line opens in 2013,
Forcier said. He didn’t provide financial details.  SAIC will introduce the Roewe 750 gasoline-electric model
in December and Roewe 550 plug-in hybrid at the end of 2012,
said Judy Zhu, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for the carmaker.  A123 and SAIC announced their joint-venture battery company
in December 2009. The Chinese automaker holds a 51 percent stake
in the venture with A123 holding the rest.  A123 also supplies lithium-ion batteries to  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG ’s BMW, truckmaker  Navistar International Corp .
and Fisker Automotive Inc., a maker of luxury plug-in hybrid
sports cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
