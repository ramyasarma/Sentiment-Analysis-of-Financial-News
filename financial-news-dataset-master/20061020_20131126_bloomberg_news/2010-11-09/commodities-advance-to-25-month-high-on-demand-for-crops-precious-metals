Commodities extended a rally to a 25-
month high as the global appetite for crops outpaced dwindling
supplies, and precious metals surged on demand for a haven from
slumping currencies.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  raw materials 
rose as much as 1.6 percent to 320.38, the highest level since
Oct. 6, 2008. The gauge has jumped 21 percent since Aug. 31, led
by cotton, sugar and silver.  Last week, the dollar slumped to the lowest level since
December against a basket of major currencies on plans by the
Federal Reserve to expand a U.S. stimulus program by buying more
debt. The euro fell today amid debt woes in the region, sending
gold to a record high. Soybeans and cotton climbed, partly on
mounting demand in China.  “The fundamentals for most commodities are very strong,
and the global currency situation, not just the dollar but also
the yen and sterling and euro, are like pouring gasoline on a
fire,” said James Dailey, who manages $145 million at TEAM
Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The CRB index rose 1.2 percent to settle at 319.11. The  UBS
Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index  advanced 1.4 percent
to 1,588.37. Earlier, the gauge of 26 prices reached 1,603.01,
the highest level since June 17, 2008.  Raw sugar extended a rally to a 29-year high on concern
that India may cap exports to boost domestic supplies after a
smaller-than-expected cane harvest. Soybeans also gained.  After the close of regular trading, silver futures dropped
from a 30-year high and gold declined after CME Group Inc.’s
Comex unit raised margin requirements.  Sugar  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.23 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at 33.11 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Earlier, the price reached 33.32 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Jan. 7, 1981. The
commodity has gained 23 percent this year.  India, the world’s second-biggest producer, may export 1.5
million to 2 million metric tons, New York-based Commodore
Research & Consultancy said yesterday. Flooding in the state of
Uttar Pradesh pushed the estimate down from 3.5 million earlier
this year, Commodore said.  “Further heavy rains in India are causing analysts to
restrict upward production estimates,” Michael McDougall, a
senior vice president at Newedge USA, said in a report. “There
is a finite amount of time for the Indian harvest to take
place.”  Soybeans  Soybean prices rose to a 26-month high after a government
report showed increasing demand for shrinking supplies from the
U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  Inventories before next year’s harvest will be 30 percent
less than forecast last month, the Department of Agriculture
said today. The crop will total a record 3.375 billion bushels,
down from 3.408 billion projected in October. The average
estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 3.426
billion bushels. Futures jumped by the exchange limit in
Chicago.  “The cut in the soybean crop was a surprise and reduces
inventories to a bare minimum,” said Mark Schultz, the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
“Demand is growing faster than global production.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 54.25 cents, or
4.3 percent, to close at $13.29 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. That marked the biggest gain since Oct. 8, when the USDA
last made its monthly forecast. Earlier, the price rose by the
CBOT limit of 70 cents to $13.4475, the highest level since Aug.
28, 2008.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
