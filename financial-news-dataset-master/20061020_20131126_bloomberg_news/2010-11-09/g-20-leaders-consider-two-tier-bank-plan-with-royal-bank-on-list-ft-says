Leaders of the Group of 20 nations
meeting this week will consider a bank regulatory plan that will
group those with global operations separately from banks with
primarily domestic operations, the Financial Times reported,
citing people briefed on the summit agenda. Banks on the global
list, which would exclude most big Asian lenders, would be
subject to greater regulation and forced to hold more capital,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
