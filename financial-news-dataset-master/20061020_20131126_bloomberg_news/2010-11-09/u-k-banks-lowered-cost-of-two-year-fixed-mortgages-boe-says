U.K. lenders reduced the cost of two-
year fixed-rate mortgages in October, the Bank of England said
today.  The average rate on a home loan fixed for two years with a
25 percent deposit fell to 3.72 percent from 3.8 percent in
September, the London-based central bank said in data posted on
its website.  The housing market has weakened after more homeowners put
their properties on sale and the government announced a budget
squeeze that may wipe out almost half a million public-sector
jobs. A U.K.  housing-market  gauge dropped more than economists
forecast to an 18-month low in October as homebuyers became
“cautious” on prospects for prices, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said today.  The average cost of a three-year fixed-rate home loan fell
11 basis points to 4.22 percent in October and declined 19 basis
points to 4.85 percent for a five-year mortgage, the bank’s
figures showed.  All figures were for loans with a 25 percent down payment.
There were no data for 10-year fixed-rate mortgages.
