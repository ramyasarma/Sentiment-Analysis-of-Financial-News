Corn fell from a two-year high after
the U.S. government cut its harvest forecast in line with
analysts’ forecasts.  Production  in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, will be 12.54 billion bushels in 2010, down from last
year’s record of 13.11 billion, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today. The average estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 12.542 billion bushels. The
USDA will update its forecast in January. Corn prices have
jumped 53 percent in the past 12 months.  “The corn market needed more than a modest decline in the
size of the crop to shock an already bullish trade,” said
 Jerrod Kitt , a market analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago.
“There was nothing in this report that wasn’t already
anticipated. It’s a long time to hold long positions before the
next USDA crop report.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $5.9025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the third straight decline and the
biggest since Oct. 21. Earlier, the price touched $6.175, the
highest level since August 2008.  Before today, the most-active contract rose 60 percent
since the end of June as adverse weather damaged U.S.
production.  Unsold U.S. supplies on Sept. 1, before next year’s
harvest, will total 827 million bushels, compared with the
month-ago forecast of 902 million and 1.708 billion a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected 831 million bushels.  Exports, World Inventories  The government cut its forecast for export sales in the
current marketing year by 50 million bushels and estimated
livestock-feed use by 100 million.  Global inventories before next year’s Northern Hemisphere
harvests will total 129.16 million tons, down from 132.36
million predicted a month ago, and less than the 147.95 million
tons estimated for a year earlier, the USDA said today. Analysts
expected 130.25 million.  “The USDA report was close enough to expectations that no
one wanted to buy more today,” said Ben Buckner, an analyst for
AgResource Co. in Chicago. The “USDA indicated that rising
prices may slow demand.”  Speculative selling increased after the price turned lower,
Buckner said.  “There were just too many speculators already long,”
Bucker said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
