Investors should sell the euro
against the dollar in the expectation that it will weaken to
$1.3450, according to Standard Bank Plc.  “The euro still looks vulnerable on the crosses as well,”
London-based  Steven Barrow , head of Group of 10 currency
strategy, said in an e-mailed note. The trade should be
abandoned if the euro strengthens to $1.4290, he said.  The euro was little changed at $1.3918 as of 11:36 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
