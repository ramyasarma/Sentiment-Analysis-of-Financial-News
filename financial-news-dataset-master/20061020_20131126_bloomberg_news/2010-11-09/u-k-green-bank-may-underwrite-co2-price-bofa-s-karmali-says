The U.K.’s proposed Green Investment
Bank considered setting a long-term price for emission
allowances by sharing some of the market risk, according to the
global head of carbon markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “There was discussion on the advisory panel about the
potential role of the Green Investment Bank in underwriting a
long-term carbon price,” Abyd Karmali, managing director at the
bank, told delegates at the Climate Finance 2010 conference
today in London.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s administration is now
considering a minimum price for CO2 emissions to underpin
investment in cleaner energy when the cost of European Union
permits falls below a certain level. That would raise costs for
power from plants fired by coal and natural gas, which are
cheaper and quicker to build than atomic reactors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
