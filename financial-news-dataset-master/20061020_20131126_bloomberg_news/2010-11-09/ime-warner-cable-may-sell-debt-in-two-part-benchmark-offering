Time Warner Cable Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. cable operator, plans to sell $1.9 billion of bonds
to pay for buying back shares and refinancing debt, according to
a person familiar with the offering.  The company plans to sell $700 million of notes due in
February 2021 and $1.2 billion of bonds maturing in November
2040 as soon as today, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Time Warner Cable is taking advantage of borrowing costs
for investment-grade companies near record lows, tapping the
bond market as it repurchases shares for the first time since
Time Warner Inc. spun it off in March 2009. The New York-based
company announced a plan to buy back $4 billion of stock on Nov.
4 after reporting third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  “The low cost of funds is what’s drawing them in,” said
 Michael Hodel , an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
“It’s an opportunity for them to take advantage of cheap
financing and accelerating their purchases.”  The notes maturing in 2021 may yield 155 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and the bonds due in 2040 may
pay a spread of 180 basis points, the person said. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Sale Managers  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing the sale, Time Warner
Cable said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which
didn’t specify the size or timing of the offering.  Moody’s Investors Service grades Time Warner Cable Baa2 and
Standard & Poor’s ranks the company an equivalent BBB.  Time Warner Cable last sold debt in December, when it
issued $500 million of five-year notes and $1.5 billion of 10-
year debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 5 percent securities maturing in February 2020 traded
at 108.9 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 3.85 percent, or
129 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Yields on investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds averaged
3.59 percent yesterday and touched 3.53 percent on Nov. 4, the
lowest on record, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  Time Warner Cable, which trails only Comcast Corp. by
number of subscribers, reported third-quarter net income rose 34
percent to $360 million, or $1 a share, from $268 million, or 76
cents a share, bolstered by higher monthly bills, an increase in
high-speed Internet subscribers and a rise in advertising sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
