Cotton futures advanced to a record
for a sixth straight day on concern that a wider production
deficit in China may boost the nation’s imports and drain global
supplies.                      Cotton for March delivery gained as much as 1.2 percent to
$1.438 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, before trading
at $1.43 at 10:02 a.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
