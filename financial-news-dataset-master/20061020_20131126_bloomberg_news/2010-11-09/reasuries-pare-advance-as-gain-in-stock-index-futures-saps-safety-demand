Treasuries fell before the sale of
$24 billion of 10-year notes and a Federal Reserve announcement
tomorrow of how much debt it will buy during the next few weeks.  Thirty-year bond yields touched the highest level since
June 22 before the Treasury tomorrow sells $16 billion sale of
30-year debt. The Fed tomorrow plans to reveal details about its
plan announced last week to buy an additional $600 billion in
government debt to support the economy.  “The market is backing up under the weight of the upcoming
supply in the 10s and 30-year auctions,” said  Dan Mulholland , a
Treasury trader in New York at Royal Bank of Canada, one of 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “There’s a
sell-off in sympathy with the supply.”  The yield on the 10-year note rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.59 percent at 12:01 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in August 2020 fell 10/32, or $3.13
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 09/32.  Thirty-year  bond yields  rose for the fifth straight day,
climbing five basis points to 4.18 percent, the highest since
June 22. Two-year note yields rose two basis points to 0.42
percent, the highest since Oct. 28.  Demand Shift  Treasury notes dropped yesterday after a $32 billion
auction of three-year debt saw reduced demand from non-primary
dealers. The three-year securities sold yesterday drew a yield
of 0.575 percent, compared with the 0.577 percent average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought 35 percent of the securities, less than the 44 percent
average of the past 10 auctions. Direct bidders, non-primary
dealer investors, purchased 13.9 percent, compared with 11.9
percent in October. That left primary dealers, 18 companies that
traded directly with the Fed, with 51.1 percent of the sale,
more than the average of 42.8 percent they purchased during the
past 10 sales.  The 10-year securities scheduled for sale today yielded
2.58 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.475 percent
at a sale on similar-maturity debt on Oct. 13. Investors last
month bid for 2.99 times the amount of 10-year notes on offer,
while the average for the past 10 auctions is 3.14. Indirect
bidders bought 41.5 percent of the debt, while the 10-sale
average is 40.6 percent.  ‘Overriding Factor’  “Supply is the overriding factor in the market place,”
 Thomas L. di Galoma , head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim
Capital Markets LLC, a New-York based brokerage for
institutional investors. “With little room for value in the
front end the auctions will show if investors are comfortable
moving out the yield curve to pick up return.”  The Fed said last week it would purchase $600 billion of
debt through June to cap borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve
will announce purchases of $105 billion dollars tomorrow when it
announces its buyback schedule, according to CRT Capital Group
LLC. It bought $1.7 trillion of assets from December 2008
through March.  The Fed has been reinvesting the principal payments from
its holdings of mortgage securities in Treasuries. Yesterday it
acquired $6.26 billion of U.S. debt, buying 15 of the 27
Treasuries listed for possible purchase. The securities mature
from October 2016 to August 2019.  Fed Buys  The Fed has purchased $75.845 billion of Treasuries since
it began the program on Aug. 17. Policy makers are seeking to
keep holdings in the System Open Market Account at about $2
trillion by using the proceeds of principal payments from its
agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.  New York Fed President  William Dudley  has emerged as the
second-most watched central bank official after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  for investors seeking guidance about monetary
policy. Among dozens of public appearances by Fed officials
between their past two meetings, Dudley’s Oct. 1 speech that
more monetary stimulus likely was needed to combat
“unacceptable” inflation and unemployment best  foreshadowed
the central bank’s move to more quantitative easing.  China’s Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. cut its credit
rating for the U.S. to A+ from AA because of a Federal Reserve
plan to purchase bonds to spur growth and inflation, according
to Xinhua News Agency.  The Fed’s quantitative easing policy will erode the value
of the dollar and is against the interests of creditors, the
company said. “Serious defects in the U.S. economy will lead to
long- term recession and fundamentally lower national
solvency,” Dagong said, as cited by Xinhua.  To contact the reporter on this story:
