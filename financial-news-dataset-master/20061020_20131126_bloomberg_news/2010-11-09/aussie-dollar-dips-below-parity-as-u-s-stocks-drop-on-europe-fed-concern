The Australian dollar fell below
parity with the greenback as concern about European debt reduced
investor demand for higher-yielding assets.  Demand for the Aussie was limited as he government said
home-loan approvals advanced. The New Zealand dollar traded near
a one-week low against the U.S. dollar.  “A sudden jump in risk aversion on concerns about Ireland
and Portugal sparked a sell-off in U.S. stocks and broad safe-
haven demand for the U.S. dollar,” said  Mike Jones , a currency
strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington.  The Australian currency traded at 99.73 U.S. cents at 11:41
a.m. in New York from $1.0035 yesterday, sliding below parity
for the second time since Nov. 3. It reached $1.0183 on Nov. 5,
the most since Australia scrapped foreign-exchange controls in
1983. The Aussie fetched 82.62 yen from 81.98 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 77.95 U.S. cents from 77.77
cents yesterday. It earlier touched 77.38 cents, the weakest
since Nov. 3. It traded at 64.37 yen from 63.53 yen.  The spread on Portugal’s 10-year bonds over comparable
German debt widened to a record 466 basis points, or 4.66
percentage points. The spread on  Irish  10-year securities over
bunds reached an all-time high 600 basis points. Portugal and
Ireland are among Europe’s most indebted countries.  U.S. stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
declining 0.5 percent. The MSCI World Index tumbled 1.2 percent.  New Zealand Reserve Bank Governor  Alan Bollard  said recent
gains in the currency are slowing an export-led recovery and
there’s a long-term overvaluation in the kiwi.  New Zealand’s economic recovery has been “tepid,” with
recent indicators suggesting the pace of recovery has slowed,
Bollard said in the RBNZ’s Financial Stability Report, released
in Wellington today. “Despite strong commodity prices,
prospects for export-led growth may also be hampered by a fairly
soft global growth outlook.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
