China’s October economic data
scheduled for release this week will strengthen the case for
further “policy normalization,” according to Royal Bank of
Canada.  The data may show further stabilization in domestic
activity, strong export growth and accelerating inflation, Brian
Jackson, a strategist at RBC wrote in a report today. The
central bank may raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage point
next year and allow the yuan to appreciate to around 6.20
against the U.S. dollar, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
