Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said today that the government may take additional
measures to protect the economy from U.S. efforts to weaken the
dollar,  O Estado de Sao Paulo  reported, citing comments by the
minister in Frankfurt.  Mantega said the U.S. decision to inject $600 billion in
the economy puts a spotlight on the currency war, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper reported. He said U.S. policies may generate
speculative bubbles that can lead to the bankruptcy of
economies, O Estado reported.  According to O Estado, Mantega said the government will
take the necessary steps to prevent U.S. policies from
contaminating Brazil’s economy. Mantega was on a stopover in
Frankfurt in his way to the Group of 20 nations summit in South
Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
