Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks fell as financial companies and
consumer companies dragged benchmark gauges lower for a second
day, overshadowing a rally in energy stocks. *Bank of America
Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Morgan Stanley dropped at least 1.3
percent, pacing declines in financial shares. Kraft Foods Inc.

New York, after rising as much as 0.3 percent.
*The Dow declined 41.06 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,365.78.
U.S. stocks rallied last week as the Federal Reserve announced a
$600 billion bond-purchase plan to boost economic growth, a
tactic known as quantitative easing.  London: European stocks climbed, sending the Stoxx Europe 600
Index to a two-year high, after companies from Barclays Plc to
Adecco SA posted better-than-estimated results. *Barclays,
Britain’s third-largest bank, added 4 percent after saying its
capital ratio remained strong. Adecco advanced 3.7 percent after
the staffing company posted a jump in third-quarter profit.
Hermes International SCA soared 7.6 percent after the luxury-
goods maker lifted its full-year sales forecast.
*The Stoxx 600 gained 0.6 percent to 273.46 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, taking the benchmark index to its highest level
since Sept. 22, 2008. The gauge has climbed 18 percent since its
low this year on May 25 as investors speculated that the U.S.
Federal Reserve would start a second round of asset purchases.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks fell, sending the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average to its first drop in five days, after the gauge reached
its highest close since July and as the yen strengthened,
cutting the outlook for export earnings.
*Canon Inc., the world’s largest camera maker had climbed 7.4
percent in the past four days, lost 1.3 percent. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, fell 0.4 percent after the

the close in Tokyo.

percent to 4,740.70 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar gained versus the euro and the yen as
yields on U.S. Treasuries increased after a $24 billion auction
of 10-year notes.

governments in Europe may struggle to pay their debt, curbing
demand for the region’s assets.

p.m.
in New York, from $1.3920 yesterday. It gained 0.4 percent to

from 113.01 yen.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries fell, with yield on 30-year bonds rising to
the highest level in five months, after the government’s sale of
$24 billion in 10-year notes drew the lowest demand since
February.
*Yields on 30-year bonds climbed for a fifth day on speculation
today’s sale of $16 billion of the securities may receive tepid
demand with the Federal Reserve focusing its purchases of
Treasuries among shorter-maturity debt.
*The yield on 30-year bonds rose 11 basis points, or 0.11
percent, to 4.23 at 2:11 p.m. in New York, the highest since

ninth straight day, heading for the longest string of gains
since March 2005. *Copper futures for delivery in December added

to a record $4.2605 in May 2008.  GOLD  New York: Gold advanced to another record on speculation that
European governments may struggle to pay debt, boosting demand
for the precious metal as an alternative to currencies. *In New
York, gold futures rose to an all-time high of $1,424 an ounce
on concern that Ireland and Greece will struggle to repay
bondholders, and spending cuts may stifle growth in the region.

session. The price for immediate delivery reached a record
$1,424.35.  OIL  New York: U.S. crude-oil inventories probably increased to the
highest level in 18 months, threatening a rally in futures
prices, as refineries idled units because of lower profit
margins, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
*Supplies rose 1.4 million barrels, or 0.4 percent, in the seven
days ended Nov. 5 from 368.2 million a week earlier, according
