Starwood Property Trust Inc. , the
real estate investor founded by  Barry Sternlicht , reported a
third-quarter profit and raised its dividend as the company
originated and bought loans in the commercial property slump.  Net income attributable to Starwood was $22.7 million, or
47 cents a share, the Greenwich, Connecticut-based company said
in a statement today. A year earlier, it reported a loss of $1.9
million, or 4 cents a share. Starwood increased its dividend to
40 cents a share from 33 cents.  Starwood is making loans and buying commercial mortgage-
backed securities tied to offices, shopping centers, apartments,
warehouses and hotels as prices fall. The company has
contributed loans to commercial mortgage securitizations,
keeping junior interests in the debt to boost returns. It
completed $203 million of new investments in the third quarter.  “We like the fact they have the credit underwriting
skills,”  Boris Pialloux , an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in
New York, said before the report. “It’s extremely important.”  The Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property Price  Index  fell 3.3
percent in August from the prior month to the lowest level since
2002, Moody’s Investors Service said Oct. 19. The measure is 45
percent below its October 2007 peak.  Beating Estimates  Starwood’s core earnings were $27 million, or 56 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or 2 cents, a year
earlier. The average  estimate  of six analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for adjusted earnings of 35 cents a share.  The company  defines  core earnings as net income excluding
non-cash equity compensation expenses, depreciation and
amortization and other items. The measure doesn’t conform to
generally accepted accounting principles.  Sternlicht, 49, was chairman of  Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide Inc.  from 1997 to 2005. He took Starwood Property
public in August 2009.  Starwood Property’ s results were released after the close
of regular U.S. trading. The shares fell 13 cents to $20.83 as
of 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have gained 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
