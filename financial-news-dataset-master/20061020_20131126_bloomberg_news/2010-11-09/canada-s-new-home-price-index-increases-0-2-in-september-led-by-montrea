Canadian new-home  prices  rose 0.2
percent in September, led by Montreal, government figures
showed.  Prices rose 1.6 percent in Canada’s second largest city,
and 0.3 percent in Calgary, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists predicted the total index would rise 0.1
percent, matching the prior month’s gain, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  of 13 responses.  From a year earlier, new-home prices increased 2.7 percent
in September, slower than August’s 2.9 percent pace.  Housing is slowing after the government ended temporary
stimulus measures and Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  warned
about record high household debts. The country’s biggest realtor
group last week cut its resale forecast for the second time this
year, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported yesterday
 housing starts  fell in October by the most since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
