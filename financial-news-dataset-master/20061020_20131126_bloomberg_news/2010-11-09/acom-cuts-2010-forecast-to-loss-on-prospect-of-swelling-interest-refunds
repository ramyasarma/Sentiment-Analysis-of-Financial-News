Acom Co. , Japan’s biggest consumer
lender by market value, cut its earnings forecast to a second
year of losses in anticipation of higher repayments of
overcharged interest.  Acom projects a  loss  of 50.9 billion yen ($630 million) in
the year ending March 31, the company said in a statement filed
to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. That compares with a loss of
7.24 billion yen last year and the lender’s previous profit
forecast of 26.2 billion yen for this year.  Tokyo-based Acom joins  Promise Co.  in setting aside more
reserves to repay overcharged interest after the September
bankruptcy of rival Takefuji Corp. spurred claims from borrowers.
The forecast revision comes a day after Aiful Corp. retracted
its full-year outlook, citing “uncertain elements” surrounding 
its business even after unexpectedly posting a profit in the 
first six months.  Operating expenses for the parent company will likely
increase to 240 billion yen, 61.7 billion yen higher than the
previous forecast, due in part to increased reserves for
interest repayments, Acom said in the statement.  Acom and its rivals are struggling amid a four-year
clampdown on coercive lending. The government tightened credit
rules in June, capping interest rates at 20 percent and limiting
loans to a third of a borrower’s annual income.  The company posted a loss of 43.9 billion yen for the six
months ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 2.44 billion
yen a year earlier, according to the statement.  Slumping Interest Income  Interest income from loans fell 14 percent to 102.8 billion
yen in the six months from 120 billion yen a year earlier, said
Acom, an affiliate of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s biggest bank. Writedown of Mitsubishi UFJ shares that
Acom holds was another reason behind first-half losses.  Mitsubishi UFJ’s shares have dropped 23 percent in the past
12 months, while Acom has declined 39 percent.  Acom slid 2.1 percent to 840 yen at the close of trading in
Tokyo today before the earnings release. Smaller rival Aiful
surged 32 percent, the  biggest gain  since March 2009, to 66 yen
following its profit report.  Aiful posted net income of 3.4 billion yen in the six
months ended Sept. 30, compared with an earlier forecast of a
3.2 billion yen loss, as interest income increased, the Kyoto-
based lender said in a preliminary earnings statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
