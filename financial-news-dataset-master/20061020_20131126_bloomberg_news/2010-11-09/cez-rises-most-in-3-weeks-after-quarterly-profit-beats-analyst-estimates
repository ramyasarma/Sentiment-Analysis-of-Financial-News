CEZ AS  shares rose the most in three
weeks after the Czech Republic’s largest power producer reported
a third-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as a
recovery in manufacturing boosted demand for electricity.  The stock  advanced  as much as 2.6 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since Oct. 19, and traded up 2.2 percent at 781
koruna as of 10:18 a.m. in Prague. The  PX  index added 0.3
percent.  Net income dropped to 11.45 billion koruna ($645 million)
from 11.94 billion a year earlier, the Prague-based utility said
today. That beat the 9.84 billion-koruna median  estimate  of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “CEZ positively surprised the market on all levels from
revenue to net profit,” analyst Marek Hatlapatka at Cyrrus
brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in an e-mailed report.
The earnings signal that CEZ may exceed its full-year profit
target of 46.7 billion koruna, according to Hatlapatka.  While electricity prices remained below last year’s level,
consumption rose 4.4 percent in the first nine months of 2010,
driven by increased manufacturing, which jumped an annual 11.7
percent in September. CEZ said its revenue climbed 2.6 percent
to 144.4 billion koruna in the three-month period, helped by the
company almost doubling sales of carbon permits.  “Overall we assess the CEZ results as very good and expect
a positive market reaction,” wrote Hatlapatka. He has an
“accumulate”  recommendation  on the stock with a price estimate
of 1,002 koruna, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
