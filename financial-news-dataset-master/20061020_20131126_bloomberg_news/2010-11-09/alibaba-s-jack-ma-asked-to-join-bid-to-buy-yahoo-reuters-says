Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Chairman
 Jack Ma  was approached by a group of private-equity companies
that’s seeking to buy  Yahoo! Inc. , Reuters reported, citing a
person it didn’t identify.  Ma hasn’t decided whether to join the possible takeover
offer for Yahoo, according to the  report , which didn’t name the
private-equity firms seeking to mount the bid. Yahoo isn’t
reviewing or seeking any proposals, and is not in active talks
with financial or strategic partners, Reuters said, citing
another person it didn’t identify.  John Spelich , a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Alibaba,
declined to comment on the report.  Alibaba, China’s biggest electronic-commerce company, said
in September that talks to buy back shares from Yahoo collapsed.
Alibaba, in which Yahoo holds a 39 percent stake, has “no
intention” of raising the matter again, the Chinese company
said at the time.  AOL Inc. has talked with private-equity funds including
Silver Lake about a possible bid for Yahoo, people familiar with
the matter said in October. Yahoo is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to help defend against possible takeover approaches,
they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
