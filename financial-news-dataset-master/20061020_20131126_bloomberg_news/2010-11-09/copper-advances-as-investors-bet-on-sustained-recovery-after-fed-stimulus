Copper in London and New York climbed
to 28-month highs as investors sought alternatives to declining
currencies amid prospects that economic growth will be sustained
after the Federal Reserve expanded stimulus measures. The metal
reached the highest in 32 months in Shanghai.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 1.6 percent to $8,801 a metric ton,
the highest level since July 2008, when it reached a record
$8,940 a ton. The contract traded at $8,748.75 a ton by 4:02
p.m. Singapore time. The Fed last week said it will purchase an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June to bolster
the U.S. economy.  “The global economy will continue on its recovery path,
and greater liquidity and prospects of inflation can only be
bullish for commodities,”  Wang Qianming , an analyst at
Everbright Securities Co., said from Shanghai. “As liquidity
expands outside China, investors are looking for a place that’s
not stocks or currencies or bonds to put their money.”  December-delivery copper on the Comex in New York rose as
much as 1.3 percent to $4.0090 a pound, trading above $4 a pound
for the first time since July 2008. Futures in Shanghai gained
as much as 2.9 percent to 68,520 yuan ($10,272) a ton, the
highest price since March 2008.  China will strengthen the auditing of overseas fundraising
and force banks to hold more foreign exchange as part of efforts
to crack down on hot-money inflows, the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange said in a statement on its website today. The
government will also regulate Chinese special-purpose vehicles
overseas and tighten controls on equity investments made by
foreign companies in China, it said.  Weakening Currencies  The euro weakened to a one-week low against the  dollar  on
concerns about sovereign debt in Europe. The pound dropped for a
third day versus the greenback after a gauge of U.K.’s housing
market slumped to an 18-month low.  A strike in Chile, the largest copper-producer, lent
support to prices, said Wang.  Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc 
kept their Collahuasi venture operating as usual as a strike by
unionized workers at the world’s fourth-largest copper mine
entered a fourth day, the company said yesterday. Output may be
affected if the strike lasts longer than a week, Morgan Stanley
said yesterday.  Aluminum in London rose 0.2 percent to $2,434 a ton, zinc
gained 1.6 percent to $2,519.25 a ton, and lead advanced 1.2
percent to $2,536 a ton. Nickel increased 0.9 percent to $24,349
a ton, and tin climbed 0.4 percent to $26,716 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
