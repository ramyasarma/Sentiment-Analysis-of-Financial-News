Swisscom AG , Switzerland’s largest
phone company, said third-quarter profit rose 4.7 percent,
beating analyst estimates. It raised its 2010 targets.  Net income gained to 536 million Swiss francs ($554
million) from 512 million francs a year earlier, the Bern-based
 company   said  today. Net revenue advanced 0.7 percent to 3.03
billion francs. Analysts had estimated net income of 510.9
million francs on sales of 2.98 billion francs.  “The Swiss business was very strong,”  Serge Rotzer , an
analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a note. “We were mainly
surprised by the strong profitability of the business. Thanks
to the strong Swiss business, Swisscom has lifted its
guidance.”  Swisscom sees net revenue, excluding  FastWeb SpA , for the
full year of about 9.35 billion francs and earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at about 4 billion
francs. The company had previously predicted the measures at
about 9.15 billion francs and 3.75 billion francs respectively.  Swisscom rose 2 percent to 419.7 francs in Zurich trading,
the highest level since February 2008, giving it a market value
of 21.7 billion francs.  Swisscom has been dealing with an investigation of alleged
value-added-tax fraud and money laundering at FastWeb, Italy’s
second-biggest fixed-line company, which it bought in 2007.  The Swiss company forecast total net revenue of about 12
billion francs for the year and Ebitda of about 4.7 billion
francs, including a provision for the VAT proceedings against
FastWeb. Swisscom said third-quarter ebitda rose 0.6 percent to
1.26 billion francs.  Weak Euro  The forecasts were raised “despite the weak euro,” Chief
Executive Officer  Carsten Schloter  said in a conference call.
“This means the Swiss business is doing much better than at
the beginning of the year.” The franc has gained 11 percent
against the euro this year.  On Nov. 2,  FastWeb  said third-quarter net income fell to
3.9 million euros ($5.4 million) from 12.6 million euros a year
earlier. Revenue rose 5.5 percent to 470.5 million euros.  Net sales and Ebitda at Fastweb may be between 3 percent
and 5 percent lower than the previous expectations of 1.95
billion euros and 580 million euros because of a revenue-
recognition change. The forecasts exclude a provision for the
investigation. FastWeb denies the charges made in the probe.  Swisscom is carrying out a public takeover offer on all
outstanding shares of Fastweb, representing about 18 percent of
the company. The offer will conclude on Nov. 12.  Dividend  Swisscom expects total cash of 256 million euros, “not
endangering the dividend payment capability of the group,” it
said in the  presentation slides  on its website.  “We are leaving our statement regarding the dividend
unchanged,” Schloter said. According to Swisscom’s payout
policy “up to half of the operating free cash flow is paid out
to shareholders in the subsequent year, with payment at least
on a par with the previous year’s  dividend ,” it said in its
nine-month  interim report  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
