European stocks were little changed
as concern mounted that some of Europe’s governments may
struggle to trim their debts. U.S. stock-index futures and Asian
shares also declined.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.1 percent to 272.13 as
of 8:07 a.m. in London. Carlsberg A/S dropped the most in the
Stoxx 600 after the Danish brewer posted third-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
