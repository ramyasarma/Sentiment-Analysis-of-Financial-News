Venezuela will devalue its currency
"by stealth" early next year as nationalizations sap foreign
investment and put added strain on government reserves,
Alejandro Grisanti of Barclays Capital said.  The government will begin selling fewer dollars at the 2.6
bolivars per dollar rate and more at the 4.3 rate in January or
February 2011, Latin America analyst Grisanti said in an
interview at a conference in Caracas. The government will also
raise the exchange rate of the central bank-administered bond
trading market, or Sitme, to 6.5 bolivars per dollar from 5.3,
he said.  “We are going to see a devaluation by stealth,” he said.
“The government won’t make a formal announcement.”  President Hugo Chavez devalued the bolivar by 50 percent in
January for the first time since March 2005 in a bid to kick
start the economy amid falling oil revenue. He banned trading in
a semi-legal parallel market after the bolivar plunged for four
consecutive months.  A finance ministry official, who declined to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak on the issue, declined to
comment.  Grisanti said all companies in Venezuela are at risk of
nationalization and advised them to keep some capital abroad to
protect themselves even if it means buying dollars at the more
expensive new rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
