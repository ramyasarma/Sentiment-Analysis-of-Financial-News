Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, said it’s leased 20 foreign
drilling rigs to begin operation in the next two years as it
seeks to boost oil and gas output at offshore fields.  Domestic shipyards will also start delivering the first of
an additional 28 rigs to be built in Brazil by about 2014,
Petrobras Chief Executive  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said today at an
event in Rio de Janeiro. Environmental permits have complicated
the contracts to build the rigs locally, he said.  Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, is contracting rigs
from overseas oil-services providers to help tap offshore
deposits such as Libra and Tupi, the largest discoveries in the
Western Hemisphere in the past three decades. Brazilian
government regulations also dictate that the state-owned company
should prioritize some purchases from local suppliers.  Oslo-based  Seadrill Ltd , which supplies Petrobras, rose 84
cents, or 2.6 percent, to $33.64 at 2:12 p.m. New York time.
Four of Seadrill’s 11 deepwater rigs were located in Brazil in
the third quarter, according to the company’s website.  Petrobras has contracted 18 rigs to be delivered in 2011
and 2012, and may have to hire more to compensate for potential
construction delays in Brazil, according to  Jud Bailey , an
analyst who covers oil drillers at Jefferies & Co. in Houston.  ‘Bridge the Gap’  It is “very unlikely” local suppliers will deliver the 28
rigs in the next three-to-seven years that Petrobras is
expecting, Bailey said today in a telephone interview.  “There’s been a lot of talk that they would come out and
tender for incremental rigs in 2011 and 2012,” he said. “They
could contract them to bridge the gap.”  Petrobras will probably be unable to receive the rigs it
needs in Brazil until 2015 because of the lack of existing
infrastructure,  Pride International Inc  Vice President  Kevin Robert  said in a Nov 4 conference call with investors. Pride
rents deepwater rigs to Petrobras, which may need to tap
international contractors further, he said.  Brazil holds the largest oil discoveries in the Americas
since 1976, and Petrobras plans to invest $224 billion in the
five years through 2014 to boost oil production and refining.
Gabrielli said Petrobras will get the rigs on time and meet its
long-term production targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
