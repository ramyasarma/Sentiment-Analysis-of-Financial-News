The  Michelin  Guide upgraded five
restaurants in Germany to two-star status and awarded 26 more
their first star. The number of three-star establishments was
unchanged at nine, the second highest in Europe after France.  The new two-star venues included three on the coast:
 Sterneck  in the Badhotel Sternhagen in the North Sea resort of
Cuxhaven; La Belle Epoque in Luebeck-Travemuende on the Baltic;
and  Restaurant Faehrhaus  on the North Sea island of Sylt.  The other two were the  Villa Rothschild Kempinski  in
Koenigstein, near Frankfurt, and the Park Restaurant at
 Brenner’s Park Hotel  in Baden Baden.  The 26 gourmet establishments awarded one new star,
bringing the total to 205, included Nagaya, a Japanese
restaurant in Dusseldorf, and Maurice, in a hotel near Dresden’s
Frauenkirche. Two more were in Munich, two in Cologne and one in
Berlin. Fourteen restaurants lost a star or closed.  Under the Michelin system, one star means a very good place
in its category, two means excellent and worth a detour, and
three stars means among the very best restaurants and worth a
special journey.  Michelin & Cie., the world’s biggest tiremaker, is based in
Clermont Ferrand, France, and has been publishing dining guides
for more than a century. The 1,440-page German guide for 2011
will go on sale from Nov. 12.  To contact the writer on the story:
