Power Grid Corp. of India, the
nation’s biggest transmission company, received at least 77
billion rupees ($1.7 billion) of bids on the first day of its
secondary share sale.  Investors sought 905.4 million shares, or 1.08 times the
stock on offer, as of 5 p.m. local time, according to the
National Stock Exchange’s  website . The state-owned company and
the government are each selling 420.9 million shares at 85
rupees to 90 rupees apiece and may raise as much as 75.8 billion
rupees in the issue, which closes Nov. 12.  The government raised 152 billion rupees from selling a
stake in Coal India Ltd. last month in the country’s biggest
initial public offering. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is
targeting 400 billion rupees from asset sales this year, when
record overseas investments helped push the benchmark  Sensitive
Index  to a record.  “The Power Grid issue is well priced and the company is a
stable one with good management, so there will be a good
response to this sale,” said  Mahesh Patil , who helps manage $3
billion in equities at Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co. “We
expect to continue seeing interest in share sales of government
companies considering the huge appetite from overseas investors,
especially if the pricing is right as it was with Coal India.”  Power Grid shares gained 5.5 percent to 103.80 rupees in
Mumbai trading today, rising the most since May 18, 2009.  The government plans to cut India’s fiscal deficit to 5.5
percent from a 16-year high of 6.9 percent through asset sales.
Overseas investors have poured 1.29 trillion rupees into Indian
stocks this year.  Network Expansion  Power Grid will use  funds  raised in the share sale on 13
transmission projects, Chairman  S.K. Chaturvedi  said in Mumbai
yesterday. The company plans to spend 1 trillion rupees to add
80,000 kilometers (49,720 miles) to its network. The grid’s
length was 79,556 kilometers as of Sept. 30, according to the
company’s share-sale  document .  India is adding transmission capacity in the world’s
second-most populous nation, where the International Energy
Agency has said more people lack access to electricity than any
other country. The nation needs to raise installed generation
 capacity  to 200,000 megawatts from the current 164,836 megawatts
to sustain economic growth, according to the power ministry.  Power Grid may raise as much as 167 billion rupees in the
financial year starting April 1, including loans from the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank, Finance Director  J. Sridharan  said in Mumbai on Nov. 8.  Individual investors and Power Grid employees are eligible
for a 5 percent discount to the offer price, the company said in
an advertisement yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , ICICI Securities Ltd.,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  and SBI Capital Markets are advisers to the Power
Grid share sale.  Power Grid’s  initial public offering  in September 2007
attracted bids for 65 times the 573.9 million shares available
at 52 rupees apiece and raised 29.8 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
