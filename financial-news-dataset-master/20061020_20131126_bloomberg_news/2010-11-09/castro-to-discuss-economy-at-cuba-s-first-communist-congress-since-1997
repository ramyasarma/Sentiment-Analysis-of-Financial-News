Cuban President Raul Castro said his
country will hold its first Communist Party congress in 13 years
next April to discuss the economy.  Castro, speaking in Havana alongside Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez, said sustaining Cuba’s socialist revolution will be
the main focus of the communist party’s 6th national congress,
which was originally announced last year. The party congress is
typically used to announce major policy changes.  Castro, 79, has initiated measures to open the economy,
including loosening of property laws and controls prohibiting
private enterprise, since his brother Fidel Castro began handing
over power in 2006.   Fidel Castro remains head of Cuba’s Communist party.  In September, Cuba announced it was dismissing 500,000
state workers equal to 10 percent of the island’s workforce. The
government has also extended lease periods to 99 years from 50
years for foreign investors in an effort to build up tourism
infrastructure and draw more visitors to the Caribbean island of
11.4 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
