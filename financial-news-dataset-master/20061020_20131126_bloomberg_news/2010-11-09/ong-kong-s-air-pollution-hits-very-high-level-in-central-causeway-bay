Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at two roadside monitoring stations today,
triggering a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory ailments to avoid staying in heavy traffic areas.  The pollution index reached 139 in the Central business
district, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website. That was the 23rd straight day that Central has
recorded readings over 100. Causeway Bay’s roadside station
reported a level of 119 as of 7 a.m., it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
