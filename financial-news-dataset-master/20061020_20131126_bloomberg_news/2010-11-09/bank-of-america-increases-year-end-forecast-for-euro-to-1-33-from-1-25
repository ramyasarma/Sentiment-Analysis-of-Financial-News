The euro will trade at $1.33 by year-
end as monetary easing from the Federal Reserve pressures the
U.S. dollar, Bank of America Corp. said, raising its forecast
from $1.25.  The firm kept its 2011 prediction for the currency pair at
$1.25, citing European sovereign-debt problems, strategists led
by  David Woo  wrote in a report to clients. The Fed said Nov. 3
it will purchase an additional $600 billion in Treasuries
through June to pump more money into the U.S. financial system
in a strategy called quantitative easing, a move that may debase
the dollar.  “We are concerned that U.S. dollar weakness will persist
in the fourth quarter given the Fed’s implementation of QE2,”
New York-based Woo, head of global rates and currency research
at BofA Merrill Lynch, wrote.  The euro has increased 7.9 percent versus the greenback
since Aug. 27, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a
speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank “will do all
that it can” to ensure a continuation of the U.S. economic
recovery.  The shared European currency weakened 1.1 percent to
$1.3773 today in New York, from $1.3920 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
