Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-
largest bank by assets, expects its loan portfolio to increase
about 21 percent this year, the low end of its forecast,
Executive Vice President  Domingos Figueiredo de Abreu  said.  “We’ll end the year at the lower end, around 21 percent,”
Abreu said today in an interview in London. “Mainly because of
the movement of large companies, which have been using capital
markets more than credit.”  The bank had forecast lending growth of 21 percent to 25
percent for the year, Abreu said. Bradesco expects loans to
increase 15 percent to 20 percent in 2011, he said. The Osasco-
based lender hasn’t released official forecasts for next year,
Abreu said. Bradesco posted a 19 percent increase in loans in
September to 255.6 billion reais ($150.2 billion) from a year
earlier, according to a regulatory filing.  Firms that have turned to capital markets for financing
include Petroleo Brasileiro, Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company. It completed the world’s biggest share sale in
September, selling about $70 billion of stock to finance its
$224 billion, five-year investment plan. Brasil Insurance
Participacoes e Administracao SA, which operates insurance
brokerage agencies, in October became the 10th company this year
to sell shares in an initial public offering in Brazil, an
increase from six in 2009.  Bradesco  fell 3 percent to 36 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo at 3 p.m. New York time. The stock gained 23
percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 5.9 percent
increase for the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
