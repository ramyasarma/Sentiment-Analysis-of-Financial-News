Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil
producer, has awarded two contracts valued at 15.7 billion
riyals ($4.2 billion) for construction of a power station and a
desalination plant in Ras Al Zour on the Persian Gulf.  A Korean-Saudi group led by  Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co.  won a contract valued at 6.6 billion riyals to
build a 1.03 million-cubic meter desalination plant in the
coastal city, the  Saudi Press Agency  said. A Saudi-Chinese group
including  Al-Arrab Contracting Co.  and  SepcoIII Electric Power
Construction Corp.  secured a separate contract valued at 9.1
billion riyals to build a 2,400-megawatt power station nearby,
the official news service said.  The projects are part of a five-year, $400 billion fiscal
stimulus package announced in late 2008 and designed to lessen
the country’s reliance on oil exports. Saudi Arabia also
approved a five-year, 1.44 trillion-riyal ($384 billion)
development plan in August, SPA reported on Aug. 9.  Saudi Arabia, with the Arab world’s biggest economy, is
developing water and electricity projects to keep pace with a
swelling population and accelerating economic growth spurred by
government spending. Power demand in the desert kingdom is
likely to increase by 8 percent a year, Saudi Electricity Co.
Chief Executive Officer Ali al-Barrak said on Oct. 4.  The desalination plant will supply 900,000 cubic meters of
drinking water a day to the capital, Riyadh; 100,000 cubic
meters to the northern town of Hafr Al-Batin; and 25,000 cubic
meters to  Saudi Arabian Mining Co. , the state-controlled metals
producer known as Ma’aden, SPA reported. Ma’aden has an aluminum
smelter project in Ras Al Zour, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north
of the industrial port of Jubail.  The power plant will provide electric power and thermal
steam needed to desalinate the 1.03 million cubic meters of
water, the news service said. About 1,350 megawatts will go to
Ma’aden and 1,050 megawatts to  Saudi Electricity Co. , a state-
controlled utility, SPA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
