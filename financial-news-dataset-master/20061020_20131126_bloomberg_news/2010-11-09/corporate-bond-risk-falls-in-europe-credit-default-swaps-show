The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds fell, reversing an earlier increase,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 7
basis points to 437, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 1:30
p.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.75 basis points to 99, JPMorgan
prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from default also
declined, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers down 3.25 at 136.25 and the
subordinated index 5 lower at 209.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
