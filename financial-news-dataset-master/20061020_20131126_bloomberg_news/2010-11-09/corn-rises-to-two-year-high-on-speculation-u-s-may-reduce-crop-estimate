Corn rose in Chicago to the highest
price in more than two years on speculation the U.S. will cut
forecasts for its production and stockpiles today after hot, dry
weather curbed output.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture will probably forecast a
domestic corn crop of 12.542 billion bushels (318.6 million
metric tons), 1 percent below a month-ago estimate, according to
a Bloomberg News survey of 34 analysts. U.S. stockpiles may
total 830.7 million bushels, down 7.9 percent from last month’s
prediction, analysts said.  “Coming into that USDA report, the market is pricing in
some bullish expectations, with the USDA likely to decrease
ending stocks,” said  Alexander Bos , a London-based analyst at
Macquarie Bank. “The market thinks supply will continue to
tighten.”  Corn for March delivery gained 9 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$6.0825 a bushel at 10:45 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices reached $6.0875, the highest level for the
most-active contract since Aug. 25, 2008. The grain has surged
50 percent since the end of July and 48 percent this year.  Global stockpiles may be forecast at 130.25 million tons,
down 1.6 percent from the October estimate, analysts said in a
Bloomberg News survey. The USDA report is due at 8:30 a.m. New
York time.  Soybeans Advance  Soybeans also gained on speculation the USDA would lower
its domestic stockpiles estimate. Inventories may total 238.8
million bushels, down 9.9 percent from the prior forecast of 265
million bushels, analysts said. The report also may show that
demand for the oilseed has strengthened as China keeps buying
from the U.S., Macquarie’s Bos said.  “The key number to watch is U.S. soybean-export demand,”
Bos said. “The pace of Chinese soybean purchases has been
extraordinary. That means USDA needs to move that number higher.
How high they push it, the market will be interested to see.”  Soybeans for January delivery advanced 15 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $12.8975 a bushel. The oilseed has risen 28 percent
since the end of July and reached $12.90 on Nov. 5, the highest
since Sept. 3, 2008. The U.S. is the world’s biggest soybean
exporter, followed by Brazil.  Wheat for December delivery climbed for a fourth session,
rising 7.25 cents, or 1 percent, to $7.4325 a bushel. The price
has gained on speculation dry weather in the U.S. southern Great
Plains will hurt recently planted crops.  Wheat Sowing  The condition of the U.S. winter-wheat crop deteriorated
last week because of dry weather in the Great Plains. About 45
percent of  winter wheat  was rated good or excellent as of Nov.
7, down from 46 percent a week earlier and 63 percent a year
earlier, the USDA said yesterday.  About 95 percent of the crop was planted in 18 states,
mostly in the Midwest and Great Plains, compared with 92 percent
a week earlier and 86 percent a year earlier.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 1.5 percent to 225.75 euros ($314.58) a ton.  Rough rice for January delivery gained 27 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $15.52 per 100 pounds in Chicago. The grain touched
$15.55, the highest for the most-active contract since Dec. 17.  Flooding across more than half of Thailand, the world’s
largest exporter of the grain, may damage 11 percent of the
nation’s rice plantation and lower output from the main crop by
3.9 percent, the farm ministry said today.  About 7.56 million rai (2.99 million acres) are estimated
to have been damaged in the country’s worst floods in five
decades. Production from the nation’s main crop, which
represents about 72 percent of total output, will probably fall
to 22.34 million tons, the farm ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
