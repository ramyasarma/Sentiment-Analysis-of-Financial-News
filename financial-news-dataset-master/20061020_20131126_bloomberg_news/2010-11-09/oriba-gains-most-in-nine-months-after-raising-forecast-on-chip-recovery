Horiba Ltd. , a Japanese maker of
medical instruments and measuring devices, gained the most in
nine months in Tokyo trading after raising its full-year profit
forecast on a recovery in the semiconductor market.  The stock  rose  5.3 percent to 2,223 yen as of 10:06 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest gain since Feb.
1. Japan’s benchmark Topix index was little changed.  Kyoto-based Horiba yesterday raised its full-year net
income forecast by 12 percent to 5.8 billion yen ($71 million)
for the year ending Dec. 31, according to a statement filed to
the exchange after markets closed. Net income rose almost eight-
fold to about 2 billion yen for the three months ended Sept. 30,
according to Bloomberg data.  Motohisa Watanabe , a Tokyo-based analyst at Ichiyoshi
Research Institute Inc. today raised Horiba to “buy” from
“neutral,” a rating he had maintained since September 2009.
Watanabe also raised the company’s 12-month share price estimate
to 3,000 yen from 2,700 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
