India’s stocks rose, led by  Bharti
Airtel Ltd.  amid expectations the nation’s economic growth will
boost corporate profits.  Bharti, the largest mobile-phone operator, gained the most
in more than a week ahead of its second-quarter earnings report
tomorrow. HDFC Bank Ltd., the third-biggest lender, climbed 2.7
percent as the central bank said it will hold additional daily
money-market auctions up to Dec. 16 to lend to banks, resuming
measures aimed at easing a cash crunch.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
gained 80.10, or 0.4 percent, to 20,932.48 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai.  “Strong economic growth and consumption will be positive
for corporate earnings,” said  D.K. Aggarwal , who manages about
$100 million as chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd.
in New Delhi. “India will be the favored destination for
investors.”  The Sensex is trading at 20 times estimated earnings,
compared with its highest ever multiple of 24 in January 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has jumped 20
percent this year, the best performance and most expensive among
the world’s 10 biggest stock markets, the data showed.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.5 percent to 6,301.55. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.4 percent
to 2,659.62.  Fund Flows  Foreign fund inflows have almost doubled this year to a
record. Overseas  investors  bought a net 69.1 billion rupees
($1.56 billion) of Indian equities on Nov. 4, extending this
year’s record inflows to 1.29 trillion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  Bharti added 2 percent to 334.55 rupees, its highest level
since Nov. 1.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , the largest household
products maker, soared 4 percent to 319 rupees, its sixth day of
gains and its highest close in at least 19 years.  India’s economy may expand 8.5 percent in the 12 months
ending March 31, the fastest pace in three years, central bank
governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said Nov. 2.  State Bank of India , the No. 1 lender, dropped the most in
more than nine months, sinking 4.5 percent to 3,272.55 rupees.
Quarterly profit of 25 billion rupees fell short of the 29.4
billion rupee average of 31 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings growth slowed as some loans soured during
the quarter. The lender almost doubled bad debt provisions to
meet a central bank September 2011 minimum requirement deadline.  More Cash  HDFC Bank, the third-biggest, gained 2.7 percent to 2,398.5
rupees, while larger peer  ICICI Bank Ltd.  rose 1.1 percent to
1,269.15 rupees.  The Reserve Bank of India will let banks reduce
bondholdings to as much as 1 percentage point below the
regulatory requirement to raise cash up to Dec. 16 without being
subject to penalty interest, it said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “We remain positive on banking shares even as State Bank’s
result has slightly disappointed,” said SMC’s Aggarwal. “They
are likely to benefit the most as the economy grows.”  Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. , the biggest transmission
company, soared 5.5 percent to 103.8 rupees after being raised
to “buy” from “hold” at Citigroup Inc., which cited the
stock’s underperformance relative to the nation’s benchmark
stock index over the last six months. The brokerage increased
its share-price estimate to 117 rupees from 116 rupees,
according to a report by analysts led by  Venkatesh Balasubramaniam .  Jindal Saw Ltd. , a pipe maker controlled by India’s richest
woman,  Savitri Devi Jindal,  dropped 1.2 percent to 224.85
rupees. The company forecast sales will fall this year due to
rising input costs. Coking coal and iron ore price increases “
may have an impact on profit,” Managing Director  Indresh Batra 
said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
