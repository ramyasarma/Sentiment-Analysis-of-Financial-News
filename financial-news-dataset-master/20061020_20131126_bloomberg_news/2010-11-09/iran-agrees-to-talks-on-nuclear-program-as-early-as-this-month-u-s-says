Iran has agreed to hold talks on its
nuclear program with the five permanent United Nations Security
Council members plus Germany, State Department spokesman Philip
J. Crowley told reporters.  Iran has responded to a letter by European Union foreign
affairs chief Catherine Ashton, and “indicated it is prepared
to move ahead,” Crowley said. The U.S. hopes the meeting
“might occur as early as the end of the month.”  Asked if Turkey would host the talks, Crowley indicated a
location has not yet been picked.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
