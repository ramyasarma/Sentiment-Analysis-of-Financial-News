U.S. soybean inventories before next
year’s harvest will be 30 percent less than forecast a month ago
as rising exports soak up an increase in production, the
government said.  Stockpiles will total 185 million bushels on Aug. 31,
down from 265 million forecast in October, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a  report , cutting
its estimate for the third straight month. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 239 million bushels, on
average. Supplies at the start of this year’s harvest
totaled 151 million bushels.  “The surprise this year has been the robust global demand
for U.S. soybeans, especially from China,” the world’s biggest
consumer, said  Bill Nelson , a senior economist at Doane Advisory
Service Co. in St. Louis. “It is not visible where demand is
going to slow.”  Soybean futures have climbed 33 percent in the past
year on record Chinese purchases and reduced production of
other oilseed crops in Russia and parts of Europe. The
January contract fell 9.25 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$12.7475 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade.  A smaller surplus means higher feed costs for
livestock producers such as Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield
Foods Inc., and may reduce margins for oilseed processors
including Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd. The
soybean crush spread -- the value of the animal feed and
cooking oil derived from a bushel of soybeans, minus the
cost of the oilseed -- has fallen 31 percent from a year
ago.  Consumption, Exports  Domestic consumption of soybeans to make animal feed
and cooking oil will total 1.665 billion bushels, unchanged
from the month-ago forecast, the USDA said. Exports will
reach 1.57 billion bushels, up from 1.52 billion projected
in October and 1.498 billion shipped overseas a year ago.  The U.S. soybean harvest may be 1 percent smaller than the
month-ago forecast after August rains failed to boost yields..  The crop will total a record 3.375 billion bushels,
compared with 3.408 billion projected in October and 3.359
billion gathered last year, the USDA said in the report.
The average estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for 3.426 billion bushels.  Yields are forecast at 43.9 bushels per acre, compared
with 44.4 bushels projected in October and a record 44
bushels a year ago. Analysts expected 44.6 bushels.  World production in the crop year that began Oct. 1
will total 257.4 million metric tons, the USDA said, up
from 255.3 million forecast a month ago. Argentina’s
estimated crop was raised to 52 million tons from 50
million tons. Output in the previous year was a record
260.1 million tons. Global use will rise to 254.7 million
tons, up from a record 238.5 million last year.  World inventories next year before the North American
harvest are estimated at 61.4 million tons, little changed
from the month-ago forecast and up from 60.4 million on
