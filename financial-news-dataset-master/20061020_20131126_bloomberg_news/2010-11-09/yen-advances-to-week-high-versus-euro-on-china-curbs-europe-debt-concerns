The yen rose against all of the most-
traded currencies after China said it will curb capital flows
into its economy and concern that European countries will
struggle with budget deficits fueled demand for safety.  Japan’s currency rose for a third day versus the euro. The
extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Portuguese and
Irish 10-year bonds instead of similar German notes climbed to
records. The 16-nation euro slumped to its weakest level in
almost three weeks against the Swiss franc. The yuan reached a
two-week high as some investors speculated China may also raise
interest rates before a Group of 20 leaders’ meeting this week.  “There is some risk aversion” supporting the yen, said
 Roberto Mialich , senior currency strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Milan. “Also there are rumors China might hike rates again. The
market has shifted its attention to the tensions in the euro
area.”  The yen advanced to 112.61 per euro at 7:45 a.m. in New
York, from 113.01 yesterday. The Japanese currency gained 0.7
percent to 80.63 per dollar. The euro strengthened 0.3 percent
to $1.3966, after sliding to $1.3824, the weakest since Oct. 29.  China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said today
it would crack down on speculative “hot money” flowing into
the country, according to a statement on the regulator’s
website. The agency will “strictly” punish banks that violate
its currency rules, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
