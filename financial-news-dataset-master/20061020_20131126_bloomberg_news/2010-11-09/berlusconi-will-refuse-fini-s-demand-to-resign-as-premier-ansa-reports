Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will
reject his former ally’s demand that he resign as premier,
government spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti said at a conference in Rome
today, news agency Ansa reported.  Fini, who co-founded the ruling People of Liberty party
said on Nov. 7 that he would pull his allies out of the
Berlusconi government if the premier refused to step down and
agree to his demands to design a new program and broaden the
administration to include the Union of Centrists party.  Bonaiuti said that if Fini’s Future and Liberty for Italy
party wanted Berlusconi to go, they would have to vote against
him in parliament and assume the responsibility for bringing
down the government, Ansa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
