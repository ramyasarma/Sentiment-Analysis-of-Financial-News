Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
tomorrow will announce additional assistance to the Palestinian
Authority, which is striving to close its budget deficit as the
U.S. seeks to revive talks toward peace with Israel.  “We are in a new fiscal year and we will have the
opportunity to make an additional contribution to the
Palestinian Authority,” U.S. State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said today in Washington. Clinton will make a
statement on the aid in a video conference with Palestinian
Prime Minister  Salam Fayyad  scheduled for 10:15 a.m. Washington
time.  Fayyad, during a visit to the United Nations General
Assembly in September, asked donors for about $500 million to
help close his budget deficit. The Palestinian Authority needed
$1.2 billion in aid in 2009 and $1.8 billion in 2008.  The European Union on Nov. 4 gave 20.7 million euros ($28.5
million) toward the salaries and pensions of about 85,000
public-sector employees.  U.S. bilateral assistance to Palestinians is forecast to be
$502.9 million this year and $550 million in 2011, according to
the State Department and the Congressional Research Service. The
government fiscal year starts Oct. 1.  The aid would come as the U.S. is seeking to get Israel and
the Palestinian Authority to resume U.S.-mediated peace talks
intended to lead to a Palestinian state. The negotiations
stalled on Sept. 26 at the end of a partial 10-month freeze on
Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.  Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  has said he
won’t continue the talks unless Israel stops settlement
building.  ‘Way Overblown’  Israel Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , who is meeting
Clinton in New York on Nov. 11, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television that Palestinian complaints about Israeli
settlement construction “a minor issue” that has become “way
overblown.”  U.S. aid to Palestinians ballooned to $980 million in 2009
to meet a humanitarian emergency in the Gaza Strip in the
aftermath of a 22-day conflict between Israel and the Hamas
movement, designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Europe.  Since the death of Palestinian leader  Yasser Arafat  in
November 2004, aid has averaged about $400 million a year. That
compares with about $75 million in annual U.S. aid in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
