The  Bovespa  stock index fell the most
in three weeks, led by homebuilders and banks, on concern
quickening inflation will spur the central bank to raise
borrowing costs.  Companies that depend on credit plunged, with  Banco
Santander Brasil SA , the Brazilian unit of Spain’s biggest bank,
and  Gafisa SA , Brazil’s second-biggest homebuilder, both falling
the most since May after inflation rose to an eight-month high.
 B2W Cia. Global do Varejo , Brazil’s largest online retailer,
completed the biggest two-day drop since August.  The  Bovespa  fell 1.4 percent to 71,679.47 as of the 3 p.m.
New York time close, the biggest decline since Oct. 19. Forty-
one stocks on the measure fell, while 23 climbed. The real
weakened 0.1 percent to 1.7013 per dollar.  “The risk of some inflationary pressures exists,” said
 Bernardo Lobao , partner at Rio de Janeiro-based hedge fund
Studio Investimentos. “If this loose fiscal policy continues,
and a tightening in monetary policy is delayed, it could impact
the outlook. But I don’t think it’s the most likely outcome.”  Brazilian consumer prices rose more than forecast in
October, pushing inflation to an eight-month high. Inflation as
measured by the benchmark IPCA price index was 0.75 percent in
October, compared with a 0.45 percent gain in the previous
month, the national statistics agency said in a report today.
The median estimate of 41 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
been for monthly inflation of 0.67 percent.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due January
2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, increased 8 basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 11.50 percent.  Santander, B2W  Santander Brasil  tumbled 5.6 percent to 24.50 reais, the
most since May 25. B2W declined 3.1 percent to 30.76 reais for a
two-day drop of 6.4 percent, the biggest since Aug. 9.  Gafisa plunged 6 percent, the most since May 13, to 13.53
reais. The company said in a filing last night that former
Chairman  Gary Garrabrant  and  Thomas McDonald , executives at
billionaire  Sam Zell ’s Equity International, left Gafisa’s board
after the Chicago-based investment firm reduced its stake.  The  Bovespa  climbed as much as 0.5 percent earlier today as
commodities rallied. Iron-ore miner  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA 
gained after a jump in Chinese auto sales boosted the price of
copper, a bellwether of global growth.  “The market as a whole is seeking assets tied to
commodities,” said  Eduardo Favrin , who oversees $2.5 billion as
head of equities for HSBC Global Asset Management’s Brazil unit
in Sao Paulo.  Copper  Copper rose for a fourth day, reaching a 28-month high as
auto sales climbed in China, the world’s largest consumer of the
metal. Chinese passenger-car sales gained at the fastest pace in
six months in October as government incentives for fuel-
efficient models boosted buying in the biggest auto market.  MMX Mineracao , controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , gained 1.1 percent to 13.70 reais as the  Bloomberg Base
Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index  increased 2.6 percent.  Vale
SA , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, rose as much as 1.4
percent before erasing gains, dropping 0.1 percent to 49.69
reais.  The  Bovespa  trades for 11 times analysts’ 2011 earnings
estimates, compared with a ratio of 11.6 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index and 15.4 for Mexico’s IPC, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.1 times the
reported profits of its companies, down from 25.5 times a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
