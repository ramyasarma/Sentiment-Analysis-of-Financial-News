World wheat inventories will be
1.2 percent smaller than forecast a month ago because of
reduced output in Russia and Eastern Europe, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said.  Global stockpiles will total 172.51 million metric
tons at the end of the marketing year on May 31, down from
174.66 million forecast last month, the agency said today
in a report. The average estimate of 17 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 173.53 million.  Production in Russia, once the world’s third-largest
wheat exporter, may total 42 million tons, the USDA said.
That’s down 1.2 percent from last month’s forecast million
and 32 percent lower than the previous year. Russia halted
wheat exports in August after the worst drought in 50 years
curbed output. The country’s grain harvest was 97 percent
complete as of Oct. 20, the USDA said Oct. 29.  Drought in Russia and Eastern Europe “hasn’t gotten
any worse, but it hasn’t shown signs that it’s gotten any
better,”  Paul Georgy , the president of Allendale Inc. in
McHenry, Illinois, said before the report. Russia “did not
plant as many hectares as they normally would have of
winter crops,” which may affect production next year as
well, he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 7.5 cents, or
1 percent, to settle at $7.3625 a bushel yesterday on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active contract has jumped
53 percent since the end of June because of shrinking world
output.  U.S. Inventories  Unsold U.S. wheat supplies at the end of May will
total 848 million bushels (23.1 million tons), down 0.6
percent from 853 million bushels estimated in October, the
USDA said. Analysts expected 856.5 million bushels.  U.S. wheat production in the year that began June 1
totaled 2.208 billion bushels, down 0.7 percent from the
previous estimate, the USDA said. The agency said it
resurveyed some producers because there were “significant
unharvested” acres when the previous survey was conducted.  The U.S. is the world’s largest wheat exporter and
ranks third in production, behind China and India. Wheat is
the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6 billion in
2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
