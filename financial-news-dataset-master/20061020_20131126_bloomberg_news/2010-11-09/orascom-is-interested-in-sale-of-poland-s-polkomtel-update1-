Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  of Egypt
is interested in the sale of Polkomtel SA, Poland’s largest
mobile-phone operator, as part of its international expansion.  “We are interested to look at Poland and the Polkomtel”
sale, Orascom Chairman  Naguib Sawiris  said at a news conference
in Dubai today, adding that another takeover target could be
Serbia’s Telekom Srbija AD.  Vodafone Group Plc , which owns 24 percent of Polkomtel,

sale of the company. Polkomtel’s other owners are controlled by
the Polish government and include oil refiner  PKN Orlen SA ,

billion), Orlen Chief Executive Officer  Jacek Krawiec  said on
Oct. 29. The owners plan to begin the sale process by sending a
memorandum to potential investors this month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
