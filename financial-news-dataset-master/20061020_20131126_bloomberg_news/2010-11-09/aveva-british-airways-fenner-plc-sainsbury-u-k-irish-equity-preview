U.K. stocks fell, led by basic-
resource companies, amid renewed concern about levels of
sovereign debt and speculation China’s efforts to stem inflation
will hamper economic growth.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group fell, dragging the
FTSE 350 Mining Index down from its highest level since June
2008, as copper declined for the first time in five days. Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc paced a selloff in financial shares
as Ireland’s bonds led a rout in debt from Portugal to Greece.
 Aveva Group Plc  slid 4.3 percent as the U.K. maker of
engineering software reported a fall in profit.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  lost 58.25, or 1 percent, to
5,816.94 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge rallied 3.5
percent last week, reaching its highest level in two years,
after the Federal Reserve pledged to buy more securities to
boost the recovery. The FTSE All-Share Index declined 1 percent
today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  lost 1.5 percent.  “Sovereign debt concerns in the euro zone have started to
weigh a little more heavily on sentiment,” said Michael Hewson,
market analyst at CMC Markets in London.  Government data due for release in China tomorrow will show
the inflation rate accelerated to 4 percent in October,
according to the median estimate of 28 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. That would be the fastest pace in two years. The
government’s full-year inflation target is 3 percent.  Reserve Ratio  China’s central bank will increase the reserve ratio
requirement for the nation’s banks by 50 basis points from Nov.
16, according to a statement posted to the People’s Bank of
China’s website today.  China “has been the trigger for investors to lock in
profits in the heavyweight mining stocks,” said  Joshua Raymond ,
a market strategist at City Index Ltd. in London.  BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, declined
2.4 percent to 2,410 pence. Rio Tinto, the third-largest, lost
2.7 percent to 4,333 pence as copper, lead, nickel and zinc
retreated in London.  Royal Bank of Scotland lost 3.6 percent to 42.16 pence.
Barclays Plc declined 2.5 percent to 289.6 pence. The FTSE 350
Banks Index lost 1.2 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Irish government
bonds instead of German bunds widened to a record today, as LCH.
Clearnet Ltd. demanded its clients place a larger deposit when
trading the nation’s securities after yields soared.  The Irish bond headed for its longest losing streak in at
least three years. Ten-year Portuguese yields jumped 30 basis
points to 7.22 percent, while Greek and Spanish bonds also
slumped.  Metals Retreat  Aveva  fell 4.3 percent to 1,454 pence after saying first-
half pretax profit dropped to 23.1 million pounds ($36.9
million) from 23.3 million pounds a year earlier.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc slipped 3.5 percent to
1,100 pence as the owner of the Holiday Inn brand was downgraded
to “equalweight” from “overweight” at Barclays Capital.

“buy.”  Fenner Plc  climbed 4.7 percent to 281.6 pence as the

pounds for the year ended Aug. 31, from 4.5 million pounds a
year earlier, the company said. Revenue gained 10 percent to
