Crude oil may surpass $90 a barrel by
the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday, building on the strength of a
rally that started Nov. 1, according to a technical analysis by
 Jim Stellakis , an independent analyst.  “Oil has followed through on the breakout above $84 a
barrel,” said Stellakis, founder of New York-based research
company Technical Alpha. An upside target of $90.50 is equal to
the height of a late September rally, projected up from the
start of the current advance, which began Nov. 1, he said.  Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rallied to $83.99 on Oct. 6 from a low of $75.10 Sept.
23. Futures closed yesterday at $87.06, the highest settlement
since October 8, 2008.  The prices may drop if futures waver at $87, but closing
above that price a few times should allow prices to reach $90 by
the Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 25, said Stellakis.  The settlement above $87 also leaves crude poised for a
rally to $105 a barrel in six months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
