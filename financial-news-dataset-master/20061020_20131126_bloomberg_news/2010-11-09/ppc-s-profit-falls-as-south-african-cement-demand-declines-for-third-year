Pretoria Portland Cement Co. ,
Africa’s largest maker of the building material, said its full-
year profit declined after South African cement demand fell for
a third year.  Net income for the 12 months through September fell to 1.01
billion rand ($148 million) from 1.02 billion rand a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. Sales were
little changed at 6.8 billion rand.  Cement volumes in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe fell
7 percent during the period, mirroring a drop in construction in
the region, PPC said. New infrastructure projects in South
Africa have been delayed while residential building has not
recovered following the global recession.  “We remain concerned about the outlook for cement demand
in the short term,” Chief Executive Officer  Paul Stuiver  said
in the statement. PPC “is well positioned to benefit from the
medium to long-term recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
