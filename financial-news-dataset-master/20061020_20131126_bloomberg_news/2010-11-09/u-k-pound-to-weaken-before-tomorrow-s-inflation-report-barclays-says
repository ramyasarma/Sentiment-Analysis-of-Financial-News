The British pound may decline before
the Bank of England publishes its quarterly inflation report
tomorrow as weaker-than-forecast housing data today highlighted
risks to growth, according to Barclays Plc.  The number of real-estate agents and surveyors saying house
prices fell exceeded those reporting gains by 49 percentage
points, compared with minus 36 points in September, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors said today.  The pound has declined 3.6 percent against major trading
partners in the past three months, Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes show. Investors have bet inflation
will accelerate as the central bank signals it’s prepared to
print more money to support the economy, a policy known as
quantitative easing.  “The weakness in the housing market poses a potential for
weaker future consumption growth,” wrote London-based currency
strategist  Sara Yates  in a research note today. “Given the
dominance of consumer activity within U.K. gross domestic
product growth, the potential for a weaker consumer poses
downside risks for growth and thus keeps the possibility for
more quantitative easing on the table.”  Eight out of 13 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
predict the Bank of England will raise its inflation forecast in
the report tomorrow.  The pound was little changed at $1.6137 as of 10:30 a.m.
The currency traded at 86.26 pence per euro compared with 86.25
pence yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
