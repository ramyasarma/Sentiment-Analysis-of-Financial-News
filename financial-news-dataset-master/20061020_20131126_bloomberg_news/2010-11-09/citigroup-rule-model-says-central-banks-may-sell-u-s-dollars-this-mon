Central bank reserve managers may be
net sellers of U.S. dollars this month after the conditions
activating a trading rule were met, Citigroup Inc. said.  The dollar fell last month; reserve managers increased
their currency holdings, on a valuation-adjusted basis, and by
more than the previous month, meaning dollar sales are likely in
November,  Steven Englander , global head of currency strategy at
Citigroup in New York, wrote in a research report today.  “If conditions one through three are met, the rule says
buy euro-dollar on the seventh business day of the month, by
which time the early reporting central banks in our sample will
have reported their reserve levels, and hold the short dollar
position through the seventh day of the next month,” he said.  The  Dollar Index , which measures the greenback against a
basket of its most-traded peers, was little changed at 76.977 as
of 4:06 p.m. in London. It is 1.1 percent weaker this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
