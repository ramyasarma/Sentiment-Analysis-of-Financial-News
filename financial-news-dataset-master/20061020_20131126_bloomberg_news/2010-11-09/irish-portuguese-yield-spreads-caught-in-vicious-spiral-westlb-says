The extra yield investors demand from
Irish and Portuguese bonds instead of German bunds may widen
further amid greater prospects for debt defaults, according to
WestLB AG.  “At times, you feel the spreads offer fundamental value,”
 John Davies , an interest-rate strategist at the bank in London,
said in an interview today. “Then you start to realize that the
longer the spreads and higher yield levels hold in place, the
greater the default risk has become because they simply cannot
afford to finance the interest burden, and then you’re in a
vicious spiral situation.”  The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10-year Irish
bonds and German bunds widened to a record 554 basis points
today, or 5.54 percentage points. The Portuguese-German 10-year
yield spread widened as much as 20 basis points to 452 basis
points, the most ever, according to Bloomberg generic data.  The cost of insuring against default by the Irish and
Portuguese governments rose to the highest levels on record
earlier today. Credit-default swaps on Irish government debt
rose to 602 basis points, before closing 30 basis points lower
at 567 basis points. Portugal reached 473.5 basis points, before
closing at 457 basis points, according to data provider CMA.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals a deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
