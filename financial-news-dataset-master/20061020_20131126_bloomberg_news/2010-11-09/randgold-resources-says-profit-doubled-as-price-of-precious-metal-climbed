Randgold Resources Ltd. , a producer
of the metal in West Africa, said third-quarter profit more than
doubled after prices of the precious metal rose.  Net income grew to $23.6 million from $11.3 million a year
earlier, the Jersey, Channel Islands-based company said in a
statement today. Sales increased 19 percent to $124.1 million.  Gold output slipped 14 percent to 101,468 attributable
ounces, while the metal for immediate delivery averaged
$1,227.73 an ounce in the period, up from $960.69.  Randgold is developing mines in Senegal, Mali and Ivory
Coast, and last year agreed with South Africa’s AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. to acquire Moto Goldmines Ltd., which has a deposit
in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
