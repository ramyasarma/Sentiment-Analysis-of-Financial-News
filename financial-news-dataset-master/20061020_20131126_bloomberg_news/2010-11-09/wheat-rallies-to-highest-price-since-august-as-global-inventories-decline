Wheat rose to a three-month high
after a U.S. government report showed world stockpiles of the
grain are shrinking and that domestic corn and soybean supplies
will be lower than forecast last month.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that global wheat
inventories will total 172.51 million metric tons at the end of
the marketing year on May 31, down 1.2 percent from the agency’s
October estimate and less than analysts expected. U.S. soybean
 stockpiles  before next year’s harvest may be 30 percent less
than forecast, and the USDA cut its domestic corn-crop
projection for the third straight month.  Wheat “ending stocks were a little lower than what the
trade was guessing, so the numbers are somewhat supportive,”
said  Jerod Leman , a broker at Wellington Commodities in Carmel,
Indiana. “The real surprise came out of the bean pit, so that’s
offering support to everything.”  Wheat futures for December delivery were up 3.75 cents, or
0.5 percent, at $7.40 bushel as of 10:21 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price climbed to $7.6075, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Aug. 12. Soybean
and corn futures jumped to the highest levels since August 2008.  Before today, wheat surged 53 percent since the end of
June, after drought harmed crops in Russia. The USDA said today
that Russia’s production may total 42 million tons, 1.2 percent
less than estimated last month.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
