Treasuries halted a two-day drop as a
decline in Asian stocks and concern European nations will
struggle to raise funds spurred demand for the safest securities.  U.S. notes were supported as the  MSCI  Asia Pacific Index of
regional stocks fell for the first time this month. The extra
 yield  investors demand to hold Ireland’s debt instead of German
bunds widened to a record yesterday while Portugal’s premium
rose to the most in 13 years. The U.S. will auction $40 billion
of notes and bonds over the next two days.  “European problems are making investors a bit more risk
averse,” said  Akira Takei , who helps oversee about $24 billion
in Tokyo at Mizuho Asset Management Co. a unit of Japan’s
second-largest bank. “Treasuries should be well supported from
here after investors bought quite a lot of riskier assets. Stock
declines are also supportive of Treasuries.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell one basis
point to 2.54 percent as of 6:38 a.m. in London, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security maturing in
August 2020 climbed 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to
100 23/32.  Takei said he is extending the duration of his Treasury
holdings after keeping them “neutral” between August through
last week. He said he’d also placed bets the dollar would
strengthen against the euro and Australia’s currency on growing
demand for safer assets. Duration is a gauge of sensitivity to
changes in yield.  Wider Spreads  The difference in yield between 10-year Irish bonds and
similar-maturity German bunds widened to a record 550 basis
points, or 5.5 percentage points. The spread on the 10-year
bonds of Portugal over German debt increased to as much as 444
basis points, the most since at least 1997. Portugal will sell
as much as 1.25 billion euros ($1.74 billion) of debt tomorrow.  The Irish government laid out a plan last week to cut
spending and raise taxes by as much as 6 billion euros in 2011.  Gains in Treasuries were tempered as the U.S. prepared to
sell $24 billion of 10-year notes today and $16 billion of 30-
year bonds tomorrow. Treasuries fell yesterday after a $32
billion auction of three-year debt drew reduced demand from non-
primary dealers.  The three-year securities sold yesterday drew a yield of
0.575 percent, compared with the 0.577 percent average forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, rose to 3.26
from 2.95 at the Oct. 12 auction.  ‘More Supply’  “There will be more supply, especially in the longer-end
securities, than demand and it’s hard to see the yield falling
on those tenors,” said  Shun Totani , a senior fund manager in
Tokyo at Asahi Life Asset Management Co., which has $8.5 billion
of assets under management.  The Federal Reserve said last week it would buy $600
billion of Treasuries through June to cap borrowing costs. The
central bank purchased $1.7 trillion of assets from December
2008 through March.  The Fed yesterday acquired $6.26 billion of U.S. debt,
buying 15 of the 27 Treasuries listed for possible purchase. The
securities mature from October 2016 to August 2019, the New York
Fed said in a statement yesterday.  The Fed has bought $75.845 billion of Treasuries since it
began the program on Aug. 17. Policy makers are seeking to keep
holdings in the System Open Market Account at about $2 trillion
by using the proceeds of principal payments from its agency
mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.  “With quantitative easing there is so much money in
developed economies like the U.S. and Japan, and funds that
cannot be invested in riskier assets just go to assets like
Treasuries,” said  Kenichiro Ikezawa , a Tokyo-based fund manager
at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd, which manages about $57 billion.
“The return is much better from longer-maturity securities than
shorter-ones.”  The 10-year yield may fall toward 2.25 percent in about a
month, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
