European  stocks climbed, sending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index to a two-year high, after companies from
Barclays Plc to Adecco SA posted better-than-estimated results.  Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, added 4 percent
after saying its capital ratio remained strong. Adecco advanced
3.7 percent after the staffing company posted a jump in third-
quarter profit. Hermes International SCA soared 7.6 percent
after the luxury-goods maker lifted its full-year sales
forecast. Carlsberg A/S paced declining shares after the Danish
brewer reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  The  Stoxx 600  gained 0.6 percent to 273.46 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, taking the benchmark index to its highest level
since Sept. 22, 2008. The gauge has climbed 18 percent since its
low this year on May 25 as investors speculated that the U.S.
Federal Reserve would start a second round of asset purchases.  “Corporate profitability continues to bounce back
nicely,” said London-based  Henk Potts , who helps oversee $248
billion as an equity strategist at Barclays Wealth. “Despite
the rally, valuations still look undemanding.”  Some 144, or 61 percent, of the 235 companies on the  Stoxx
600  that have announced results since Oct. 7 have beaten analyst
estimates for per-share income, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the U.S., 76 percent of  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  companies have topped predictions in the period.  European Stocks Predictions  European stocks will rally 16 percent by the end of next
year as growth in the global economy drives earnings, according
to Deutsche Bank AG strategists. Easier lending conditions for
banks and households will spur economic growth as the demand for
credit increases more than estimated, strategists including
London-based  Gareth Evans  wrote in a report today.  National benchmark indexes rose in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 0.4 percent,
while France’s CAC 40 Index advanced 0.8 percent. Germany’s DAX
Index gained 0.6 percent.  Adecco increased 3.7 percent to 60.75 Swiss francs after
reporting a 42 percent jump in third-quarter profit to 128
million euros ($177.5 million), helped by its purchase of U.S.
staffing company MPS Group Inc. That beat the 109.6 million-euro
 average estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Barclays gained 4 percent to 297 pence after saying its
capital ratio remained “strong” even as quarterly profit
declined 76 percent.  The lender’s capital ratio “is a lot better than people
will expect and should be taken really well by the market,”
wrote  Michael Helsby , an analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research, who has a “buy” rating on the stock. The lender’s
Core Tier 1 ratio remained at 10 percent, unchanged from the
first half, Barclays said.  Hermes Climbs  Hermes  advanced 7.6 percent to 166.05 euros after the
French luxury-goods maker in which LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA holds a stake raised its full-year revenue forecast
as its third-quarter sales jumped 31 percent.  Revenue will climb about 15 percent in 2010, excluding
currency swings, assuming that “solid” sales growth continues
in the fourth quarter, revising an Aug. 31 forecast of 12
percent growth. Sales increased to 590.1 million euros from
452.1 million euros a year earlier.  Deutsche Post AG gained 4.1 percent to 13.80 euros after
Europe’s largest postal service reported a quarterly profit of
226 million euros after a surge in cross-border shipments
boosted revenue from freight. That compared with an 83 million-
euro loss a year earlier and beat the average  analyst estimate 
of 215 million euros.  Swisscom, Carlsberg  Swisscom AG increased 2 percent to 419.70 francs after
Switzerland’s largest phone company reported third-quarter net
income of 536 million francs ($555.6 million), beating the
average  analyst estimate  of 510.9 million francs.  Danone gained 1.5 percent to 47.16 euros after the Wall
Street Journal reported that Kirin Holdings Co. has held initial
talks through representatives with the yogurt maker about buying
all or part of its bottled-water unit. The Journal added that
Kirin’s rivals Suntory Holdings and Asahi Breweries Ltd. may
also want to acquire the division. Danone could sell the unit
for $5 billion to $7 billion, the newspaper reported.  Carlsberg dropped 5 percent to 565 kroner after the maker
of Tuborg and Baltika beer reported third-quarter net income of
1.95 billion kroner ($362.8 million) amid “challenging”
conditions in northern and western Europe.  That missed a 2.17 billion-krone  average estimate  of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. So-called organic net revenue,
which excludes the effect of acquisitions and disposals, grew 2
percent.  Corio NV lost 3.7 percent to 48.99 euros as Algemene
Pensioen Groep NV sells 4.5 million shares at 48 euros each via
an accelerated bookbuild process. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the
sole bookrunner for the share placing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
