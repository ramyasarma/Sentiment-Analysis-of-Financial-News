Lightstone Group LLC, a real estate
company, and its founder  David Lichtenstein  were sued over a
$100 million guaranty that was triggered when hotel chain
Extended Stay Inc. filed for bankruptcy last year.  Lightstone and Lichtenstein granted the guaranty in favor
of lenders and are liable for losses stemming from the
bankruptcy,  U.S. Bancorp  said in the complaint filed yesterday
in New York state court. Lightstone acquired Extended Stay in
2007.  Extended Stay , based in Spartanburg, South Carolina, filed
for bankruptcy in 2009. A group of investors, including
Centerbridge Partners LP, acquired the company out of bankruptcy
this year.  U.S. Bancorp, the trustee for senior debt holders, is
seeking to be paid ahead of junior lenders to Extended Stay,
according to the complaint. In separate cases, junior lenders
are suing Lichtenstein and Lightstone under guaranty agreements,
according to court papers.  David Friedman , a lawyer for Lichtenstein and Lightstone,
said they aren’t liable.  “We think the law is pretty clear that under the facts of
this case there isn’t any liability and we will defend this suit
as we’ve defended the others,” Friedman said.  The case is U.S. Bank NA v. Lightstone Holdings LLC,
651951-2010, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
