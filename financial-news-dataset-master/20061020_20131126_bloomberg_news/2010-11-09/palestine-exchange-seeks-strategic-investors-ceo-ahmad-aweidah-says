The  Palestine Exchange  is seeking
strategic investors as the bourse looks to improve services next
year, Chief Executive Officer  Ahmad Aweidah  said today.  The bourse is “looking for one or two strategic
investors,” Aweidah said in a telephone interview from the West
Bank city of Ramallah.  The Arab Palestinian Investment Co. plans to sell shares in
an initial public offering in the first quarter of 2011 and is
seeking to raise $20 million, he said.  Wataniya Palestine Mobile
Telecommunications Public Shareholding Co.  plans to list on the
exchange after its IPO, he said.  “We have two significant IPOs coming up and we hope they
will have a huge impact on liquidity and trading volume in the
market,” Aweidah said. The exchange’s capitalization may
increase to $3 billion after the two offerings, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
