China’s passenger-car sales  in
October rose at the fastest pace in six months as government
incentives for fuel-efficient cars boosted buying in the world’s
largest auto market.  Wholesale deliveries of cars, sport-utility vehicles and
multipurpose vehicles increased 27 percent from a year earlier
to 1.2 million last month, the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said today in a statement.  China, the world’s biggest polluter, introduced a 3,000
yuan ($450) subsidy for energy-efficient vehicles in June to
help cut smog. Models from  Ford Motor Co. ,  Hyundai Motor Co.  and
General Motor Co. are among those that qualify for the funding.
Consumers may also be bringing forward purchases because they’re
unsure if the government and carmakers will extend buying
incentives into 2011, said  Xu Minfeng , an analyst at Central
China Securities Holdings in Shanghai.  “It is hard to forecast how demand will go next year if
the government stops or partially stops extending stimulus
packages to vehicle buyers,” Xu said.  Passenger-car sales surged 76 percent to 946,400 vehicles
in October 2009 as the government cut the tax rate for small
cars, according to data from the association  The nation’s total vehicle sales, which include trucks and
buses, increased 25 percent to 1.54 million, according to the
association.  Stockpile Period  Auto demand is expected to be strong for the rest of the
year, analysts from Citigroup Inc., JD Power & Co. and IHS
Automotive have said.  Citigroup analysts  Gerwin Ho  and  Ross Wei  raised their
forecast for China’s 2010 car sales growth to 25 percent from 20
percent in a report on Oct. 19. Discounts from dealers and
automakers rushing to meet year-end targets may spur sales, said
 Lin Huaibin , a Shanghai-based analyst at automotive consultant
IHS Global Insight.  China’s auto sales may reach 17 million units this year,
Zhu Hongren, the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology’s chief engineer, said Oct. 28.  China halved a small-car sales tax to 5 percent last year
to spur demand, helping the country overtake the U.S. as the
world’s largest vehicle market. The government raised the tax to
7.5 percent this year, hurting domestic carmakers such as  BYD Co.   Shenzhen-based BYD’s October vehicle sales fell 13 percent
from a year earlier to 40,578, the company said last week.  China may raise a vehicle-use tax on large passenger cars,
according to  draft plan  posted on the National People’s Congress
website on Oct 29. Cars equipped with engines of between 1.6
liters and 2.0 liters may be taxed 660 yuan to 960 yuan,
according to the plan. Cars equipped with engines exceeding 4.0
liters may be charged 3,600 yuan to 5,400 yuan.  Current rates are 60 yuan to 660 yuan, according to a
statement from the State Council issued in 2006.  -- Liza Lin  and Ying Tian. Editors:  Kae Inoue ,  Terje Langeland   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
