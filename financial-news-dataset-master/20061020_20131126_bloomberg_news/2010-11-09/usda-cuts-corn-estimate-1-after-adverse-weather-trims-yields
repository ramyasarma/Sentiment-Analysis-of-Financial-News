The U.S. corn crop will be 1
percent smaller than forecast a month ago, the government
said, after flooding in June and hot, dry weather in August
cut Midwest yields for a third straight month.  Production will total 12.54 billion bushels, down from
12.664 billion projected a month ago and less than last
year’s record 13.11 billion, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. The average estimate of
34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 12.542
billion bushels.  “The hot weather and flooding resulted in lower
yields,”  Alan Brugler , the president of Brugler Marketing
& Management Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska, said before the
report. “We have yet to see a reduction in corn demand. We
will have to see a slowdown in demand.”  The report was released before the start of trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade, where corn futures for March
delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $5.9925 a
bushel yesterday. The most-active contract has surged 60
percent since June 30 as adverse weather damaged crops.  Today’s estimate is the fourth for this year’s crop
based on farmer questionnaires and a USDA survey of about
1,900 fields in the Midwest.  Reduced supplies of corn may increase expenses for meat
companies such as  Tyson Foods Inc.  and  Smithfield Foods
Inc.  Makers of corn-based ethanol such as  Valero Energy
Corp. , Poet LLC and  Archer Daniels Midland Co.  may see
margins squeezed.  Rain, Heat  Parts of the Midwest received the most rain in June
since 1960, damaging root development and yield potential,
said  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather LLC in
Chicago. In July and August, temperatures in Iowa, Illinois
and Indiana were the fifth-warmest since 1960, restricting
movement of sugars and starch into kernels, he said.  “Corn yields usually suffer when it’s too hot,”
Brugler of Brugler Marketing said. “We will not solve the
supply problem until next year’s harvest.”  The USDA cut its yield forecast to 154.3 bushels per
acre from 155.8 bushels last month. Analysts expected 154.5
bushels, on average. Last year, yields were a record 164.7
bushels.  Farmers will harvest 81.263 million acres this year,
the USDA predicted, unchanged from a month ago.  Unsold U.S. supplies on Sept. 1, before next year’s
harvest, will total 827 million bushels, compared with the
month-ago forecast of 902 million and 1.708 billion a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected 831 million
bushels.  World Production  World production  in the year that began Oct. 1 will be
818.52 million metric tons, down from the month-ago
forecast for 819.65 million.  Production in China, the biggest producer and consumer
after the U.S., will total 168 million tons, up from 166
million forecast last month and up from 158 million last
year, the USDA said.  Inventories  before next year’s Northern Hemisphere
harvests will total 129.16 million tons, down from 132.36
million predicted a month ago, and less than the 147.95
million tons estimated for a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 130.25 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
