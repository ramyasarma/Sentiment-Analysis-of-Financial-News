Ma Delun, a deputy governor of
China’s central bank, said the nation is highly alert for
inflation risks and won’t leave inflation unchecked.  The nation should be on alert for inflation and asset
bubbles fueled by the U.S.’s so-called quantitative easing, Ma
said at a forum in Beijing today. The quantitative easing may
also cause pressure on emerging markets and increase global
imbalances, Ma said. The easing will also “to some extent”
improve the U.S. economy, Ma said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
