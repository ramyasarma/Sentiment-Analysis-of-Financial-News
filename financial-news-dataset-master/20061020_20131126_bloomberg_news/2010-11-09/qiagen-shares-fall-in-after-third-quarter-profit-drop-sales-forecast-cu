Qiagen NV  fell in Frankfurt trading
after third-quarter profit declined and the biotechnology
company cut its sales forecast for the year.  Qiagen shares dropped 7 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 13.44
euros at 5:35 p.m. in Frankfurt.  Net income fell to $36.5 million in the third quarter from
$37.7 million a year earlier, the Venlo, Netherlands-based
company said yesterday. Qiagen cut its revenue forecast for the
year, saying sales are expected to be between $1.09 billion and
$1.11 billion because fewer patients in the U.S. are visiting
doctors for tests to detect the virus that causes cervical
cancer. The company had previously forecast revenue of between
$1.12 billion and $1.17 billion.  Qiagen reiterated its forecast for diluted earnings per
share to be between $0.91 and $0.92 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
