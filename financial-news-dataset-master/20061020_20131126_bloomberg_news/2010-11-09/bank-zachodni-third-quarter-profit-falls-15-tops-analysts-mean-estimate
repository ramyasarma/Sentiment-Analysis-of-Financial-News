Bank Zachodni WBK SA , the Polish bank
being bought by  Banco Santander SA  of Spain, said third-quarter
net income fell 15 percent as personnel costs rose.  Net income declined to 222.9 million zloty ($78.6 million)
from 261 million zloty a year earlier, it said in a regulatory
statement today. That compares with the 218.3 million-zloty  mean
estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Costs rose to 451.2 million zloty from 388.6 million zloty,
driven by a 15-percent increase in personnel expenses, the
Warsaw-based bank said.  Zachodni “is being sold and has been trying to keep its
employees,” Iza Rokicka, an analyst at BRE Bank SA, said by
phone. “We can’t also exclude potential provisions for
bonuses.”  Santander in September agreed to buy Allied Irish Banks
Plc’s 70 percent stake in Zachodni for 2.94 billion euros ($4
billion). Spain’s biggest bank still needs to get the Polish
regulator’s approval to complete the transaction.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, rose 11 percent
to 458 million zloty, while fees and commissions fell 3.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
