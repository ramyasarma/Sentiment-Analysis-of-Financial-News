Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on two days in the third quarter and made more
than $100 million on seven days.  Losses on Goldman Sachs’s trading desks were between $25
million and zero on two days during the period that ended on
Sept. 30, according to a  filing  today by the New York-based
company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm’s traders made between $75 million and $100 million on 24
days, the filing showed.  Trading revenue at eight of the biggest Wall Street firms
declined an average 12 percent through September from the same
period a year ago, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company
filings. Goldman Sachs, which generated 69 percent of its
revenue this year from trading, blamed a 36 percent decline in
third-quarter trading  revenue  on reduced client activity.  Of the 66 trading days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs
traders made money on 64 days, the filing showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
