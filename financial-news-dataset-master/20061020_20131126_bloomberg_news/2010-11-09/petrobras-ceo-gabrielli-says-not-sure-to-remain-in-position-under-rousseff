Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Chief
Executive Officer  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said he doesn’t know
whether he will remain at the helm of Brazil’s state-controlled
oil company under the country’s President-elect  Dilma Rousseff .  Gabrielli, 61, spoke to reporters today at an event in Rio
de Janeiro.  “I don’t know,” he said, when asked about his job future
after the Brazilian elections. Gabrielli added that such a
decision would be made by the company’s board.  Gabrielli, who has been chief executive officer since July
2005, has overseen development of Petrobras’s Tupi offshore oil
discovery, the Americas’ biggest find in three decades. He’s
also headed the company that raised as much as $70 billion in
the world’s largest share sale in September.  Rousseff is in her eighth day as President-elect of Brazil.
She served as energy minister and cabinet chief under President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva before stepping down to run for office
in March.  The day after the Brazilian elections, on Nov. 2, Rio de
Janeiro-based newspaper O Globo reported that Gabrielli was
almost certain to continue in his role until after the
government revises regulations for developments in the so-called
pre-salt region.  Brazil lawmakers may postpone until next year a pending
vote related to exploration of the pre-salt region, Folha de Sao
Paulo newspaper reported Nov. 2, citing representative Candido
Vaccarezza.  Petrobras added  2 centavos to 27.55 reais in Sao Paulo at
2:12 p.m. The stock has dropped 8.5 percent this year, while
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa Index has climbed 6.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
