English soccer champion Chelsea is in
talks to leave Stamford Bridge and build a new 60,000-seat
stadium in west London, the Guardian reported.  Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich , is
considering a move to a site at Earls Court half a mile away
from its present home, the newspaper said, citing a person
familiar with the negotiations it didn’t identify.  Chelsea trailed Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City
and Liverpool in average attendance in the Premier League last
season and a bigger stadium would allow the Blues to boost
matchday revenue, the paper said.  A new stadium would not be ready until 2015 because Earls
Court is scheduled to host the 2012 Olympic Games volleyball
competition before the exhibition center is demolished, the
paper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
