Cotton futures jumped 3.5 percent to
another record after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reduced
its estimates for domestic production and inventories.  Output  will be 18.42 million bales in the year ending July
31, down 2.4 percent from last month’s projection, after crops
in Texas were damaged by adverse weather, the USDA said today.
The agency lowered its estimate for world output by 1.2 percent.
Before today, futures surged 88 percent this year amid a
shortfall spurred by China’s increasing demand.  “It’s as bullish as any report I can remember,” said  Mike Stevens , 72, an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana.
“The big surprise was the cut in the U.S. production.”  Cotton for March delivery rose by the exchange limit of 5
cents to $1.4711 a pound at 10:06 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S., the
highest level since the fiber began trading 140 years ago. The
contract rose to a record for the sixth straight session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
