Oil surged to a two-year high as
advancing equities and a weakening dollar tempered concern of
rising excess crude supplies in the U.S., the world’s largest
oil consumer.  Futures advanced for a seventh day as the dollar retreated
from a one-week high against the euro. An Energy Department
report tomorrow may show that crude stockpiles in the U.S.
 increased  1.75 million barrels last week from 368.2 million,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. That would
take it to the largest amount since May 2009.  “Financial factors like the euro-dollar and equities are
driving the recovery, but sustained gains on the back of
fundamentals are unlikely,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst
at VTB Capital in London. “Inventories are plentiful, there are
no serious supply disruptions and the dollar rebound is capping
gains.”  Crude for December delivery rose as much as 57 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $87.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That’s the highest price since Oct. 9,
2008. It was at $87.49 as of 13:43 p.m. London time. The
contract earlier fell to a low of $86.44. Brent crude for
December gained 39 cents to $88.85 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures exchange.  Yesterday, the New York contract advanced 21 cents to
$87.06, the highest settlement since Oct. 8, 2008.  Futures, which surged 78 percent in 2009, have gained 9.4
percent this year. Prices rallied in the past six days, matching
the longest rising streak since April.  The dollar traded for $1.3925 against the single European
currency as of 10:54 a.m. London time, from $1.3824 earlier.  Inverse Correlation  Oil has increasingly moved in the opposite direction to the
dollar. New York crude futures showed a correlation of minus
0.79 with the currency today, dropping from 0.54 on May 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A correlation of minus
1 means the two moved in opposite directions and 1 signals they
moved in tandem.  “There continues to be the inverse correlation between the
U.S. dollar movements and the oil price,” said  Ben Westmore , a
minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
Melbourne. “Crude stocks are still relatively high.”  U.S.  crude stockpiles  have increased for three weeks to 14
percent above the five-year average level, as refiners cut
processing to the lowest rate since March, the Energy Department
said last week.  Gasoline  inventories probably decreased 1 million barrels
in the week ended Nov. 5 from 212.3 million, according to the
Bloomberg News survey.  Distillate fuel  stockpiles, including
heating oil and diesel, are expected to have fallen 2.1 million
barrels from 164.9 million, the survey showed.  The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington. The
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will publish its
own data today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
