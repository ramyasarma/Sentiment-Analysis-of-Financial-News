Soybean prices rose to a 26-month
high after a government report showed increasing demand for
shrinking supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest grower
and exporter.  Inventories before next year’s harvest will be 30 percent
less than forecast last month, the Department of Agriculture
said today. The crop will total a record 3.375 billion bushels,
down from 3.408 billion projected in October. The average
estimate of 34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 3.426
billion bushels. Futures jumped by the exchange limit in
Chicago.  “The cut in the soybean crop was a surprise and reduces
inventories to a bare minimum,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
“Demand is growing faster than global production.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 54.25 cents, or
4.3 percent, to close at $13.29 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. That marked the biggest gain since Oct.
8, when the USDA last made its monthly forecast. Earlier, the
price rose by the CBOT limit of 70 cents to $13.4475, the
highest level since Aug. 28, 2008.  U.S. inventories will be 185 million bushels on Aug. 31,
down from 265 million forecast in October, the government said.
The estimate was slashed for the third straight month. Analysts
expected 239 million bushels. Supplies at the start of this
year’s harvest were 151 million.  A smaller surplus means higher feed costs for livestock
producers including  Tyson Foods Inc.  and Smithfield Foods Inc.
Profit margins may shrink at oilseed processors including Archer
Daniels Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd.  U.S. exports will reach a record 1.57 billion bushels, up
from 1.52 billion projected in October, the USDA said.  The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
