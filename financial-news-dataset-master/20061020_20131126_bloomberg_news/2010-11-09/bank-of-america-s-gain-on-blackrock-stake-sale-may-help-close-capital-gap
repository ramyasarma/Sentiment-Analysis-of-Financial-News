Bank of America Corp.  may record a
pretax gain of almost $360 million and bolster its capital by
selling most of its stake in  BlackRock Inc ., the world’s largest
money manager.  Bank of America sold 43.6 million shares yesterday at $163
each and plans to sell 2.45 million more shares directly to an
 institutional investor  and 5.21 million shares in the next 30
days to meet demand, BlackRock said today in a statement. The
combined 51.26 million shares is about 26 percent more than
planned when the sale was announced Nov. 3 and would total $8.36
billion at yesterday’s sale price, according to the filings.  Banks hurt by the financial crisis are unloading
investments they don’t consider crucial to their main
businesses. Bank of America, the biggest investor in New York-
based BlackRock, agreed with federal regulators to achieve at
least $3 billion in net gains from asset sales by the end of
this year, and accrued about $1.9 billion as of Sept. 30.  Bank of America’s 34 percent stake in BlackRock had a
carrying value of $10.2 billion, or about $156 a share,
according to a Sept. 30 regulatory filing. The Charlotte, North
Carolina-based lender  acquired  the stake through its 2009
purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.  The bank had no comment on its expanded sales of BlackRock
shares because the transactions aren’t complete, spokesman  Jerry Dubrowski  said. The bank’s economic interest in BlackRock would
decline to 7.1 percent from 34 percent, pending completion of
the sales, according to a BlackRock filing yesterday.  BlackRock  declined $3.60, or 2.1 percent, to $165.49 at
9:30 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Bank of
America gained 13 cents to $12.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
