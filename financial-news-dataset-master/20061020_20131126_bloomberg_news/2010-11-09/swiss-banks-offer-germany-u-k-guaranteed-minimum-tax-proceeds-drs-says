Swiss banks have offered Germany and
the U.K. guaranteed minimum payments if clients from those
countries pull out their assets before new tax deals take
effect, DRS radio reported, citing a Swiss lawmaker.  The arrangement would be part of an agreement between
Switzerland and the two other countries allowing them to claw
back some of the taxes due on undeclared German and U.K. assets
held in Swiss banks, upper-house member Eugen David was quoted
as saying by the  report .  Germany and the U.K. “are concerned that lots of clients
may cancel their account in Switzerland and move elsewhere,”
David was quoted as saying.  The two countries would be guaranteed a minimum return,
with the banks making up any shortfalls caused by clients
withdrawing funds to avoid a new withholding tax, the report
said. Swiss bankers wouldn’t have any incentive to help clients
move their money to other offshore locations, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
