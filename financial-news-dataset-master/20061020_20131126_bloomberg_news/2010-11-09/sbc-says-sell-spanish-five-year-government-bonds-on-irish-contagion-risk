Investors should sell five-year
 Spanish bonds , betting the widening yield premiums demanded for
Irish and Portuguese debt will also spread to securities issued
by the Iberian nation, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  “At most risk to further contagion are the markets of
Spain, Italy and Belgium, because these countries are unlikely
to grow strongly enough to avoid the fiscal arithmetic becoming
more challenging,” Steven Major , global head of fixed-income
research in London, wrote in a research note dated yesterday.  The extra yield investors require to hold Portuguese and
Irish 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German bunds reached
records yesterday amid concern investors would face losses under
potential plans to deal with nations that can’t service their
debt.  While Europe’s proposal for a Sovereign Debt Restructuring
Mechanism will take years to be implemented, “bond holders will
react now on the basis that the amount and timing of future
cashflows could change,” Major wrote. Under the plan, “bond
holders –- individuals, banks and asset managers –- could
eventually face large losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
