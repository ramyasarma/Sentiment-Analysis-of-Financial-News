Mexico’s  consumer prices  rose more
than forecast in October, climbing 0.62 percent from the
previous month as food and housing prices increased.  Prices rose 4.02 percent from a year earlier, the central
bank reported today on its website. Economists expected monthly
inflation to increase 0.56 percent and forecast an annual rate
of 3.97 percent, according to the median estimates in surveys
conducted by Bloomberg.  Mexico is experiencing only “moderate” wage increases and
limited external pressure on prices, central bank Governor
 Agustin Carstens  told reporters Oct. 27. The inflation outlook
will allow the central bank to cut the number of policy meetings
it will hold next year to eight from 11, Carstens said as he
presented the bank’s quarterly inflation report.  Latin America’s second-biggest economy will grow 5 percent
this year as it recovers from the biggest contraction in seven
decades last year, Carstens said. Mexico’s central bank last
month extended its longest-ever interest rate pause, keeping the
overnight rate at 4.5 percent.  Mexico’s consumer confidence fell in October, the national
statistics agency said Nov. 5 on its website. The index
decreased to 89.2 from 91.6 in September, the agency said.  The peso was little changed at 12.2226 per dollar at 11:32
a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
