Iran’s central bank is injecting more
than $1 billion into the market every week,  Aftab  reported,
citing central bank Governor  Mahmoud Bahmani.   The central bank can “easily control” flows if too much
foreign currency enters the market over a specific period, the
Tehran-based newspaper said, citing Bahmani. Iran had $57
billion of oil revenue last year, Bahmani said, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
