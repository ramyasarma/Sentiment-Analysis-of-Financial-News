A Mexican national, who leased the
Los Reyes copper mine in northern Chile where two workers were
killed yesterday, fled the country, investigators confirmed.  The person, whose name wasn’t disclosed, took an injured
worker to the hospital before abandoning a truck at the Copiapo
airport and flying to Santiago, Lorena Soto, deputy prosecutor
in the northern city of Copiapo, said in a statement e-mailed by
the public prosecutor’s office.  “We’ve been able to establish that the subject left the
country yesterday afternoon, heading toward Argentina,” Soto
said in the statement. Prosecutors will continue investigating
the accident and may bring charges of manslaughter and causing
serious injury, she said.  Five miners escaped yesterday’s cave-in, which was caused
by explosives. Regulators hadn’t authorized the Los Reyes mine’s
operations or its use of explosives, Mining Minister  Laurence Golborne  said yesterday in a message on his Twitter account,
which was verified by his press office.  Los Reyes is in the same region of the Atacama Desert as
the San Jose copper and gold mine where last month’s rescue of
33 miners was watched by hundreds of millions of people around
the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
