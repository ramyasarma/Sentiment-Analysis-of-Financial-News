Kumho Tire Co ., South Korea’s
second-largest tiremaker by revenue, may reach a deal with
creditors on new cash injections and debt restructuring by the
end of the month, the head of  Korea Development Bank  said.  The Gwangju, South Korea-based company, a unit of  Kumho
Asiana Group , has already reached an agreement to convert debt
to equity,  Min Euoo Sung , chief executive of KDB, said in an
interview yesterday in Seoul. KDB is Kumho Tire’s main creditor.  “The debt-equity conversion has been decided, and we’re
working on some additional cash and debt restructuring,” Min
said, without elaborating. “We expect an agreement concluded by
the end of November.”  Kumho Asiana lost control of its units to creditors after
debt swelled following its 2006 purchase of  Daewoo Engineering &
Construction Co.  The industrial group put Daewoo Engineering up
for sale last year, facing a cash call of about 4 trillion won
($3.6 billion) from creditors who helped finance the acquisition
of the nation’s third-biggest builder.  KDB is seeking agreement from other financial investors for
potential plans to inject an additional 100 billion won and to
delay repayment of 140 billion won in maturing loans by 2014,
