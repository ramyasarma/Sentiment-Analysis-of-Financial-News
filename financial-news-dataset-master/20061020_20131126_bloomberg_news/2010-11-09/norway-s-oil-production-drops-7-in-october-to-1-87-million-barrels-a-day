Norway, the second-biggest exporter
of natural gas, said output rose 13 percent in October from a
year earlier, while crude oil production slipped 7 percent.  Oil production dropped to 1.868 million barrels a day from
2.009 million and gas output rose to 9.3 billion cubic meters
from 8.2 billion, according to preliminary figures today from
the  Norwegian Petroleum Directorate . Norway pumped 365,000
barrels a day of condensate and natural-gas liquids.  In the year through September, the average daily production
has been about 1.8 million barrels of oil, “marginally less”
than the Petroleum Directorate’s forecast, which also includes
Yme that hasn’t started production yet, the agency said in the
statement.  Norway, the world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter,
discovered oil 40 years ago and many existing fields are being
depleted. Oil output peaked in 2000 and is forecast to drop 6
percent this year to about 1.87 million barrels a day, according
to a directorate estimate. Statoil ASA, which operates 80
percent of the country’s oil and gas production, last week cut
its output guidance for this year to 1.9 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 1.925 million to 1.975 million a day.  Oil and natural gas investments are forecast to climb to a
record 148.8 billion kroner ($25 billion) next year, from an
estimated 139.4 billion kroner in 2010, as companies raise
spending on platforms to keep aging fields alive, Norway’s
Statistics Agency said in a September report.  Following is a table of final data for Norway’s oil and gas
production in September. All figures are in standard cubic
meters of oil equivalent, where 1 standard cubic meter of oil
equivalent equals 1,000 standard cubic meters of gas. One cubic
meter of oil equals 6.29 barrels.
