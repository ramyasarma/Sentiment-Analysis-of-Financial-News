The  yield premium  investors demand to
hold Irish government bonds instead of German bunds implies
bondholders would face a loss of at least 30 percent should the
nation reorganize its debt, UniCredit SpA said.  “The market gauge of a possible haircut is increasing,”
 Elia Lattuga , a fixed-income strategist in Milan, said yesterday
in a telephone interview. “Obviously, this doesn’t mean they
will enforce a haircut, but the exercise shows what is implied
by current market prices.”  Yield spreads over bunds show investors are pricing in a
100 percent probability of a 30 percent loss for Irish 10-year
and 15-year benchmark bonds, Lattuga said. The prices imply a 64
percent chance investors would lose 50 percent of their
investment, he said.  The difference in yield between Irish and German 10-year
securities reached a record 554 basis points today and was at
553 points as of 4:28 p.m. in London today. Ireland has
suspended debt sales until the end of the year. Ray Gordon, an
outside spokesman for Ireland’s National Treasury Management
Agency, wasn’t able to comment.  “If you compare Ireland now with what happened in Greece
in April, the probability of a certain haircut is lower, but the
pace of increase in this probability is remarkable,” Lattuga
said. Still, “Ireland has quite a strong cash position and most
likely it won’t need to go the market until the middle of next
year” to raise funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
