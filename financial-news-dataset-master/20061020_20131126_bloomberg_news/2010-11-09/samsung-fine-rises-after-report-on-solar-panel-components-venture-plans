Samsung Fine Chemicals Co.  surged in
Seoul trading after the Korea Economic Daily said the company is
in talks with MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. of the U.S. to
manufacture polysilicon in South Korea for solar panels.  The South Korean  maker  of fine chemicals jumped 11 percent
to 78,400 won as of 10:37 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, headed for
the highest close since Sept. 24, 1994. The stock was the best
 performer  on the Kospi 200 Index.  The companies will invest 600 billion won ($537 million) in
the 10,000 metric tons-a-year plant, the Korea Economic Daily
reported, citing an unidentified industry official. Lim Young
Oh, a Samsung Fine spokesman, wouldn’t comment. Korea Exchange
Inc., the bourse operator, ordered Samsung Fine to comment on
the report by 6 p.m. today.  The potential investment “reflects confidence in the
growth prospects of the global solar power market,”  Han Byung Hwa , an analyst at Hyundai Securities Co., wrote in a note
today.  The global solar power market may expand to $98.9 billion
by 2019 from $30.7 billion in 2009 as countries including
Germany, Spain, Japan and South Korea boost investment to reduce
greenhouse gases, according to South Korea’s energy ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
