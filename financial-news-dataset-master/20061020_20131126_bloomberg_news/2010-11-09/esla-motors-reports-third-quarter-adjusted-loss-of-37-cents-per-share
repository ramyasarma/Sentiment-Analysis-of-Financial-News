Tesla Motors Inc. , the U.S. electric
carmaker backed by  Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Daimler AG , posted a
third-quarter loss excluding some costs of 37 cents a share,
less than analysts forecast.  The maker of battery-powered Roadster sports cars said in a
statement that its adjusted loss widened to $34.2 million in the
period ended Sept. 30 from $4.1 million, or 58 cents a share, a
year earlier. The average estimated loss from four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 43 cent a share. Revenue fell to $31.2
million from $45.5 million.  Given Tesla’s plans to spend heavily over the next nine
quarters to get the Model S sedan into production, “attaining
quarterly profitability isn’t a goal,” Chief Executive Officer
 Elon Musk  said today on a conference call. “We’re very focused
on long-term profitability.”  Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, intends to become
the auto industry’s leader in battery-powered cars, aided by
supply agreements with Toyota and Daimler. The company is
revamping a former Toyota joint-venture factory in Fremont,
California, that’s scheduled to begin making the $57,400 Model S
by mid-2012.  Tesla shares fell 14 cents to $24.49 in late trading at
5:47 p.m. New York time after the results were released. Earlier
they slipped 35 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $24.63 in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. The stock has risen 45 percent since
an initial public offering on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
