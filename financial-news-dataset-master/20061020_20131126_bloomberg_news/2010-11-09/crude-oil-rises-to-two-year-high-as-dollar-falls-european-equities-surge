Crude oil fell from the highest level
in two years as the dollar strengthened against the euro,
curbing the appeal of commodities as an alternate investment,
and equities declined.  Oil dropped for the first time in seven days as the euro
slipped amid concern some governments in Europe may struggle to
pay their debt. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  decreased, led
by financial and consumer companies.  “The dollar’s stronger today, so certainly that’s helping
to keep a lid on prices,” said  Stephen Schork , president of
consultant Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Crude for December delivery fell 34 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $86.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, it touched $87.63, the highest price since
Oct. 9, 2008, on an intraday basis. Futures have risen 9.2
percent in the past year.  Prices declined from the settlement as the dollar extended
its gains. Oil pared those losses after the American Petroleum
Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles
decreased 7.4 million barrels to 360.2 million. It was the
biggest one-week drop since the aftermath of Hurricanes Gustav
and Ike in September 2008.  December oil fell 51 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $86.55 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent crude for December dropped 13 cents to settle at
$88.33 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures exchange.  Dollar Gains  The dollar increased 1.1 percent to $1.3771 per euro at
4:39 p.m. in New York. The S&P 500 fell 9.85 points to 1,213.40,
and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 60.09 points, or
0.5 percent, to 11,346.75.  Oil has risen 6.5 percent this month as the dollar weakened
after the Federal Reserve announced Nov. 2 it would purchase
$600 billion in additional assets to stimulate the economy, a
move known as quantitative easing.  “Financial factors like the euro-dollar and equities are
driving the recovery, but sustained gains on the back of
fundamentals are unlikely,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst
at VTB Capital in London. “Inventories are plentiful, there are
no serious supply disruptions and the dollar rebound is capping
gains.”  Heating oil and gasoline futures advanced before tomorrow’s
U.S. inventory report. Fuel stockpiles probably fell last week,
according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Inventories  The Energy Department report may show that supplies of
 distillate fuel , which include heating oil and diesel, fell 2
million barrels from 164.9 million, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of 15 analysts. Inventories were 19 percent above
the five-year average in the week ended Oct. 29.  Heating oil for December delivery rose 0.90 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.4067 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices
increased for a seventh consecutive session, the longest advance
since April.  Gasoline  inventories probably decreased 1 million barrels
in the week ended Nov. 5 from 212.3 million, according to the
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline for December delivery rose 0.65 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.185 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest settlement
price since Aug. 3.  Crude stockpiles in the U.S.  increased  1.5 million barrels
last week from 368.2 million, according to the analyst forecast.
That would take inventories to the largest amount since May
2009. Supplies were 14 percent above the five-year in the last
report.  The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  EIA, IEA Forecasts  The U.S. Energy Department  increased its crude oil price
forecast for 2011 to an average $85.17 a barrel from $83,
according to its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook, released
today. It also boosted its fourth-quarter 2011 forecast by $2
from a month ago to $87 a barrel “as U.S. and global economic
conditions improve.”  The department raised its outlook for global oil
consumption next year to 87.77 million barrels a day from 87.44
million last month.  Earlier today, the International Energy Agency in Paris
forecast that China will drive a surge in world energy demand
over the next quarter century, as straining supply enhances the
market share of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and growing coal use undermines efforts to contain
global warming.  Chinese Demand  Chinese demand will jump 75 percent, accounting for more
than a third of an increase in energy use that will bring global
consumption to 16.7 billion metric tons of oil equivalent by
2035, the IEA forecast in its annual World Energy Outlook.  “The IEA’s report, their annual world outlook, came out
with some interesting facts about emerging markets that’s
provided a bit of an interesting background,” said  Matt Smith ,
a commodities analyst for Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 594,704
contracts as of 4:39 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 582,052
contracts yesterday, 17 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.49 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
