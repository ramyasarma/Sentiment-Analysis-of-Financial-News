Treasuries fell, with the yield on
30-year bonds rising to the highest level in five months, after
the government’s sale of $24 billion in 10-year notes drew the
lowest demand since February.  Yields  on 30-year bonds climbed for a fifth day on
speculation tomorrow’s sale of $16 billion of the securities may
receive tepid demand with the Federal Reserve focusing its
purchases of Treasuries among shorter-maturity debt. The bid-to-
cover ratio for the 10-year note sale, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.8, compared with an average of 3.14 for the past 10 sales.  “It’s the law of unintended consequences,” said  Theodore Ake , head of Treasury trading at Societe Generale in New York.
“By the Fed telling us what they are going to do, they cause
everyone to buy early and now there are no shorts in the market.
When we get supply, it rolls right through them. There are not
enough shorts in the market to absorb the supply.”  The  yield  on 30-year bonds rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percent, to 4.25 at 5:05 p.m. in New York, the highest since
June 4. The price of the 3.875 percent securities maturing in
August 2040 fell 2 2/32, or $20.63 per $1,000 of face value, to
93 23/32.  Auction Yields  Today’s $24 billion 10-year sale drew a yield of 2.636
percent, compared with the average forecast of 2.644 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of nine of the Federal Reserve’s 18
primary dealers.  The current 10-year  note  yield rose 11 basis points to 2.66
percent. Ten-year yields touched a 2010 high of 4.01 percent on
April 5 and a low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8. Two-year note
yields increased four basis points to 0.44 percent, the highest
since Sept. 30.  The Fed said in a statement Nov. 3 at the end of a two-day
Federal Open Market Committee gathering that it will make 4
percent of its purchases in the 17- to 30-year sector, less than
the other sectors.  The last 30-year bond  sale  was weaker than expected,
drawing a yield of 3.852, higher than the average forecast of
3.831 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of the Fed’s 18
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount offered, was 2.49, the
lowest since February.  ‘Big Question’  “The big question in the market is the 30-year bond, the
auction tomorrow and whether we will see demand for Treasuries
out there,” said  Thomas Tucci , head of U.S. government bond
trading at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets in New
York, one of 18 firms that trade directly with the Fed.  For today’s 10-year auction, indirect bidders, an investor
class that includes foreign central banks, purchased 56.6
percent of the securities , the highest ever,  compared with
41.5 percent at the sale on Oct. 13 and 54.7 percent at the
September auction. The investor class averaged 40.62 percent for
the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer  investors  that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.4 percent of
the notes, compared 10.7 percent at the October auction and an
average of 14.1 percent for the past 10 offerings.  “The looming QE2 purchases did not aid the market today
with supply concerns at the forefront,”  Justin Lederer  and
 Amrut Bharambe , interest-rate strategists in New York at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, wrote in a note to clients. “If today’s price
action is any sign, tomorrow’s will be even more volatile.”  Ten-Year Returns  Ten-year securities have returned investors 14.2 percent
this year, outperforming the 8.7 percent gain for the broader
Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes.  The Fed tomorrow plans to reveal details about its plan
announced last week to buy an additional $600 billion in
government debt to support the economy. It bought $1.7 trillion
of assets from December 2008 through March.  “Investors are increasingly going to have to fight over
the 10-year notes and there is a little squeeze in the area,
given the Fed’s expectation to buy there a lot there,” said
 Suvrat Prakash , an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP
Paribas Securities Corp., one of the 18 primary dealers required
to bid at Treasury auctions.  The Fed has been reinvesting the principal payments from
its holdings of mortgage securities in Treasuries. The Fed has
bought $75.845 billion of Treasuries since it began the program
on Aug. 17. Policy makers are seeking to keep holdings in the
System Open Market Account at about $2 trillion by using the
proceeds of principal payments from its agency mortgage-backed
securities and agency debt.  Treasury Sale  The Treasury sold $32 billion in three-year debt yesterday
at a yield of 0.575 percent, compared with 0.577 percent average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of 18 primary
dealers.  China’s Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. cut its credit
rating for the U.S. to A+ from AA because of a Federal Reserve
plan to purchase bonds to spur growth and inflation, according
to Xinhua News Agency.  The Fed’s quantitative easing policy will erode the value
of the dollar and is against the interests of creditors, the
company said. “Serious defects in the U.S. economy will lead to
long- term recession and fundamentally lower national
solvency,” Dagong said, as cited by Xinhua.  To contact the reporters on this story:
