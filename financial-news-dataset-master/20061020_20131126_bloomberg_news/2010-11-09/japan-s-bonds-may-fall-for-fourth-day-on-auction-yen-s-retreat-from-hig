Japanese bonds fall, pushing yields
on 10-year debt to a six-week high, as the yen’s retreat from
near a record eased concern that exporters’ profits will drop.  Yields on benchmark five-year notes climbed for a fourth
day as the Ministry of Finance prepared to sell 2.4 trillion yen
($29 billion) of the bonds tomorrow. RBS Securities Japan Ltd.,
one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales, boosted its year-end estimate on 10-year yields to 1.1
percent from 0.9 percent.  “The strength of stocks is driving gains in yields,” said
 Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.,
which manages about $57 billion. “The yen’s gains had
threatened to push the economy into a double-dip recession.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond added two basis
points to 0.99 percent, the highest since Sept. 27, as of 3:22
p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The 1 percent security due September
2020 fell 0.18 yen to 100.089.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery declined 0.18
to 142.52 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 1.4 percent.  The yen traded at 81.82 per dollar today, easing from the
80.22 level reached on Nov. 1 that was the strongest since April
1995 and close to the postwar record of 79.75. A weaker yen
increases the value of overseas sales at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  ‘Room to Rise’  “Concern about a double-dip recession has eased because of
the possibility the central bank will ease policy further to
counter the yen’s appreciation,” Resona’s Kurose said.  The BOJ cut its key interest rate last month to a range of
zero to 0.1 percent and announced the creation of a 5 trillion
yen fund to buy assets including exchange-traded funds and
government bonds.  Japanese  government debt  rose to a record 908.86 trillion
yen at the end of September, a 4.78 trillion-yen increase from
the previous quarter, a Ministry of Finance report showed today.  The  spread  between 10-year yields in the U.S. and Japan
stands at 170 basis points. The gap reached 176 basis points on
Oct. 27, the widest level since Aug. 9.  “Relative to U.S. yields, Japanese 10-year rates still
have a lot of room to rise,”  Akihiko Inoue , chief market
analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors Securities Co., wrote in a
report today.  The benchmark five-year yield advanced 1.5 basis points to
0.35 percent. Japan’s prior sale of the notes on Oct. 19 saw its
coupon set at 0.3 percent and drew bids valued at 3.43 times the
amount on offer, compared with a so-called  bid -to-cover ratio of
2.79 times the previous month.  Worsening Sentiment  “Selling for a hedge is apparently increasing ahead of
tomorrow’s auction,” said  RuiXue Xu , a strategist at RBS
Securities, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. “Because of
the chance that the coupon rate will be set at 0.4 percent,
five-year securities have become more attractive to investors
who have preferred to stay on the sidelines.”  Primary dealers often reduce holdings of bonds in case
prices decline before they can pass on the new securities to
investors.  Declines in bonds were limited after government data showed
Japanese household sentiment slid to a seven-month low in
October. The confidence index dropped to 40.9 from 41.2 the
previous month, matching a level set in March, the Cabinet
Office said today.  “We recommend that investors buy on dips after the
correction phase lasts for a certain amount of time, assuming a
prolonged period of low interest rates from a long-term
perspective,”  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates strategist in Tokyo
at RBS Securities, wrote in a report dated today. The bank
expects 10-year yields will be at 1.05 percent by the end of
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
