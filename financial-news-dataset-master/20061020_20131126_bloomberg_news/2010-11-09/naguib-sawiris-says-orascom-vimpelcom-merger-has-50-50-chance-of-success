Naguib Sawiris, the chairman of
Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, said the merger of the bulk of his
telecommunication assets with Vimpelcom Ltd has a “50-50”
chance of success.                 Sawiris said that he will seek international arbitration to
settle his dispute with the Algerian government over Orascom’s
unit there if the government doesn’t heed the company’s request
for an amicable solution. He made the comments at a news
conference in Dubai today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
