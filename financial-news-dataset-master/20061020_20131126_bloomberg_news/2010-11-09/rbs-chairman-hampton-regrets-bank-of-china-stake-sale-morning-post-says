Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, regrets the lender’s decision to
sell its 4.3 percent stake in Bank of China Ltd., the South
China Morning Post reported.  China’s government was disappointed about the sale because
it was supposed to be a long-term investment, Hampton said,
according to the Morning Post.  RBS bought its Bank of China stake in 2005 and sold the
holding for 1.7 billion pounds last February, after receiving
the biggest bailout in banking history from the British
government, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
