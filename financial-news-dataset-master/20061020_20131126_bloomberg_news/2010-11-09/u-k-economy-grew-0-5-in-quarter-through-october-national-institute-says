The British economy grew at the
slowest pace since the first quarter of this year in the three
months through October, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research said.  Gross domestic product  increased 0.5 percent, the group,
whose clients include the Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement today in London. The result is
slower than the 0.8 percent pace recorded in the third quarter.  The International Monetary Fund said today that the Bank of
England should be “nimble” and respond quickly if the economy
experiences faster inflation or shows signs of a faltering
recovery. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government is enacting
the deepest public-spending squeeze since World War II,
threatening to weaken economic growth.  “The U.K. economy’s strong performance over the past seven
months does not suggest a further round of quantitative easing
is currently necessary,” Niesr said in the report.  Niesr releases its estimate each month after the Office for
National Statistics publishes manufacturing data. Those figures
today showed a 0.4 percent increase in industrial production in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
