 Mail.ru Group Ltd., the Russian
investor in Facebook Inc., said the proceeds of its initial
public offering reached $1 billion after organizers of the sale

Morgan Stanley bought 3.3 million depositary receipts at $27.70
each, the Moscow-based company said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
