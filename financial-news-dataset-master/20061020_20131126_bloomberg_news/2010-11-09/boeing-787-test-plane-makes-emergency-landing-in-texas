Boeing Co.  said it will replace a
power-control panel on a 787 Dreamliner test jet after a fire
while airborne and will need several days to finish studying
flight data for clues to the cause.  Additional inspections are under way to determine whether
other repairs are needed, Boeing said in a statement today, a
day after the plane made an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas.
One of the 42 people on board suffered a minor injury, the
Chicago-based planemaker said.  The episode refocused attention on a plane whose commercial
debut has been delayed six times as Boeing struggles with new
materials, parts shortages, redesign work and a greater reliance
on suppliers. Boeing said it couldn’t say whether the incident
would affect the first delivery, due around February.  “We’re going to have to evaluate what the corrective
action is and what schedule impact there might be,”  Scott Fancher , the 787 program chief, told reporters in Everett,
Washington. “It’s too early to have that information.”  Flight data retrieved from the 787 are being analyzed in a
process that will require several days, said  Lori Gunter , a
Boeing spokeswoman. Test flights of the plastic-composite plane
have been suspended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
