Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. ,
Germany’s only publicly traded soccer club, rose to the highest
in almost four years in Frankfurt trading after extending its
Bundesliga lead to improve the prospects of playing in the
Champions League.  The shares rose as much as 17 percent to 2.44 euros, the
highest since December 2006. Borussia Dortmund won 4-0 at
Hannover two days ago to increase its advantage in the standings
to  four points  as second-place Mainz lost 1-0 at Freiburg.  “Investors are buying the shares as they expect Dortmund
to participate in the Champions League which would bring a lot
of money for the club,” said  Klaus Kraenzle , a consumer goods
analyst at Silvia Quandt & Cie AG in Frankfurt.  Participating clubs in the group phase of the Champions
League, European soccer’s elite club competition, earn an
average 15 million euros ($20.8 million), about the double of
what participants in the second-tier Europa League generate,
Kraenzle said.  Bundesliga rival Bayern Munich earned 44.9 million euros in
prize money after reaching last season’s final.  Borussia Dortmund, which last reached the Champions League
group stage in the 2002-2003 season, had a net loss of 6.2
million euros in the year through June.  The shares were up 32 cents, or 15 percent, to 2.41 euros
at 11:35 a.m. local time, extending a 13 percent gain yesterday.
The Dortmund-based company has a market value of 149.8 million
euros.  Founded in 1909 by a youth group that split from a Catholic
parish club, Borussia took its name from a local Dortmund
brewery, the Borussia Brauerei. Borussia is Latin and means
Prussia, the former German state, in English.  To contact the reporter on this story:
