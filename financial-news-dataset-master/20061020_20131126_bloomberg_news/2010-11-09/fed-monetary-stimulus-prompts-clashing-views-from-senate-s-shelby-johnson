Top lawmakers on the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee stated opposing views about the Federal
Reserve’s expansion of record monetary stimulus, widening the
political rift over the effort to spur the U.S. recovery.  “I commend the Fed for being willing to try and help
improve economic growth in America,” South Dakota’s  Tim Johnson , a Democrat who’s in line to begin leading the committee
in January, said today in a statement to Bloomberg News. Alabama
Senator  Richard Shelby , the panel’s top-ranking Republican, said
he’s “worried about the risks” of the Fed’s actions.  The comments deepen a split between Democrats and
Republicans over Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s Nov. 3 decision
to purchase $600 billion in Treasuries through June. President
 Barack Obama , a Democrat who reappointed Republican Bernanke to
a second term that began in February, yesterday defended the
Fed, while former Republican vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin  criticized the action.  “Bernanke has made a decisive move regarding our nation’s
monetary policy, and I will closely monitor the QE2 developments
and market impact,” Johnson said in a statement provided by
 Julianne Fisher , a spokeswoman. QE2 is shorthand for the Fed’s
second round of quantitative easing, or asset purchases. The
central bank bought $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage
debt through March 2010.  Johnson, 63, is poised to take the helm of the committee
with the departure of Chairman  Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut
Democrat who decided not to seek re-election this year.  Shelby, 76, in a statement through  Jonathan Graffeo , a
spokesman, said that “while I share Chairman Bernanke’s concern
regarding the condition of the economy, I am worried about the
risks associated with his actions.” He said that Bernanke
“would not be in this position had President Obama and the
Democrats used their power to enact pro-growth policies.”  Republicans won the House of Representatives from Democrats
in last week’s midterm elections while slimming down the
Democrats’ Senate majority by six seats to 53-47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
