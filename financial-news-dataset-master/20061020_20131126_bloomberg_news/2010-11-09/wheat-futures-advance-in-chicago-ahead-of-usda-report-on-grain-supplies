Wheat futures rose for a fourth day
on speculation the U.S. Department of Agriculture may lower its
estimate on global grain supplies.  Wheat for December delivery added as much as 0.2 percent to
$7.3775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading
at $7.37 at 8:09 a.m. Singapore time. March-delivery corn was
little changed at $5.99 a bushel, while soybeans were little
changed at $12.73 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
