Tyco International Ltd. , the world’s
largest maker of security systems, agreed to sell a majority
stake in its Electrical and Metal Products unit to a buyout firm
for $720 million, withdrawing plans to spin off the division.  The proceeds from the 51 percent stake sale to Clayton
Dubilier & Rice LLC will be used to accelerate share buybacks
under a $1 billion program announced on Sept. 8, the
Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based company said today.  The unit manufactures tubing, sprinkler pipe and metal clad
electrical cables. The division will operate as a standalone
entity under the name Atkore International.  “The transaction sharpens our focus on our core security,
fire and flow control platforms and reduces our exposure to the
cyclical steel and copper markets,” Tyco Chief Executive
Officer  Ed Breen  said in the statement.  Tyco had fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations
excluding one-time items of 74 cents. The average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 66 cents.  For Clayton Dubilier, the purchase adds to other industrial
holdings that include a 42.5 percent stake in Univar, the
biggest U.S. chemical distributor. Clayton Dubilier sold Brakes,
a food supplier to caterers in the U.K. and France, in 2007
after boosting the company’s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization by 70 percent, according to the
firm’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
