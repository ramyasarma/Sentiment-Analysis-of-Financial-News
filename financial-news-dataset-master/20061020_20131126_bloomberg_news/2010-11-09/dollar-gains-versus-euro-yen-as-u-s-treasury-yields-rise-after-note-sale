The dollar strengthened for a third
day against the euro and rose versus the yen as yields on 30-
year Treasury bonds at a five-month high bolstered demand for
the currency from risk-averse investors.  The euro fell versus most major counterparts amid concern
some governments in Europe may struggle to pay their debt,
curbing demand for the region’s assets. U.S. stocks dropped.
 Treasury yields  climbed after a $24 billion auction of U.S. 10-
year notes drew lower-than-average demand.  “We’ve seen the dollar benefit from risk-off,” said
 Andrew Busch , a global currency strategist at Bank of Montreal
in Chicago. “That 10-year Treasury auction was weak. Bonds are
selling off, equities are selling off and the dollar is
strengthening.”  The dollar advanced 1.1 percent to $1.3773 per euro at 5
p.m. in New York, from $1.3920 yesterday. It touched $1.3753,
the strongest level since Oct. 27. The greenback gained 0.6
percent to 81.69 yen, from 81.18. The euro declined 0.4 percent
to 112.51 yen, from 113.01 yen.  The U.S. currency rose versus most major counterparts as
the U.S.  30-year bond yield  touched 4.26 percent, the highest
level since June 4, fueling investor appetite for dollar-
denominated assets. The current  10-year Treasury yield  was up as
much as 12 basis points to 2.67 percent, its biggest intraday
jump in two months, after the sale drew $2.80 in bids for every
$1 sold, versus an average $3.14 at the past 10 auctions.  The  yield difference , or spread, between 10-year Treasuries
and comparable-maturity German bunds increased to 26 basis
points, the widest in more than five weeks. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Stocks, Oil Drop  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of stocks fell 0.8 percent,
and crude oil for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent after
earlier rising 0.7 percent to $87.63 a barrel in New York, the
highest in two years.  The euro has dropped 1.3 percent this month among 10
developed-nation currencies, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes show.  The Swiss franc strengthened versus the euro for the sixth
straight day, the longest since June, amid concern that
sovereign-debt burdens facing some European nations will damp
demand for the shared currency. The franc gained 0.9 percent to
1.3334 per euro.  The yield spread on Portugal’s 10-year bonds over
comparable German debt widened to a record 452 basis points,
while the spread on  Irish  10-year securities over bunds reached
a record 554 basis points. Portugal and Ireland are among
Europe’s most indebted countries.  ‘Hangover Is Miserable’  “The party was too good for a while, and now the hangover
is miserable,”  Kit Juckes , head of foreign-exchange research at
Societe Generale, said in an interview with on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  The yen earlier gained versus the dollar after China said
it will curb capital flows into its economy.  China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said today
it would crack down on speculative “hot money” flowing into
the country, according to a statement on the regulator’s
website. The agency will “strictly” punish banks that violate
its currency rules, the statement said.  Sterling fell against most of its major counterparts,
erasing earlier gains, before the Bank of England publishes its
quarterly inflation report tomorrow. The pound weakened 0.9
percent to $1.5987, from $1.6139 yesterday, while trading little
changed versus the euro at 86.16 pence. Earlier it touched 85.90
pence, the strongest level since Sept. 30.  Dagong Cuts U.S. Rating  China’s Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. cut its credit
rating for the U.S. to A+ from AA because of a Federal Reserve
plan to purchase bonds to spur growth and inflation, according
to Xinhua News Agency.  The credit outlook for the U.S. is negative amid
deteriorating debt repayment capability and a “drastic” drop
in the government’s intention to repay debt, Dagong said, as
cited by the state-controlled news agency. The Fed’s
quantitative-easing policy will erode the value of the dollar
and is against the interests of creditors, the company said.  The Fed said last week it will buy $600 billion in
Treasuries through June to pump more money into the U.S.
financial system.  The euro will trade at $1.33 at year-end as monetary easing
from the Fed pressures the U.S. dollar, according to Bank of
America Corp., which revised the estimate from $1.25.  Dollar Index  The dollar may rally to a level last reached in September
as the greenback’s price against a basket of currencies
including the euro and yen diverges from a momentum gauge,
according to Citigroup Inc.  The November low of IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s  Dollar
Index  is beneath the previous month’s low, while the low in a
 stochastic gauge  of momentum this month is higher than its low
in October. Similar “momentum divergence” in November 2009
indicates a possible increase in the Dollar Index to 79.31,
Citigroup analysts led by New York-based  Tom Fitzpatrick  wrote
in a research note to clients today.  The index rose for a third straight day, the longest
winning stretch since the five days ended Aug. 25. It gained 0.9
percent to 77.741 after earlier falling 0.4 percent to 76.709.  To contact the reporter on this story:
