Mauritius’s stock index  climbed to
the highest in 29 months, led by Mauritius Commercial Bank, on
expectations the country’s biggest lender by market value will
maintain its interim dividend at last year’s level.  The 37-member  SEMDEX index  advanced 1 percent to 1,890.15,
the highest since June 2008, by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port
Louis, the capital.  MCB , which makes up more than 22 percent of
the gauge, added 1.4 percent to 150 rupees, the highest since
October 2009.  “We would expect the banking group to maintain its interim
dividend at 2.25 rupees per share,” Kishen Nadassen, senior
research analyst at Port Louis-based Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said
in a phone interview from the city. The dividend declaration
will coincide with the publication of the bank’s first-quarter
results that are due at the end of the week, he said.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s stocks measure has risen
14 percent this year, outpacing an 8.1 percent gain in the  MSCI
World index  and underperforming the  MSCI Frontier Market  gauge’s
15 percent advance. Nomura International Ltd., a unit of Japan’s
biggest brokerage, rated the country’s equities “bullish” and
said Mauritius was well positioned to act as a financial hub
between the Middle East, North Africa and India, according to an
e-mailed report today.  Ireland Blyth Ltd. , a logistics and retail company, climbed
the most since Oct. 13, adding 2.9 percent to 70 rupees. First-
quarter profit advanced 56 percent to 160.3 million rupees ($5.4
million) from a year earlier, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
