Stefan Fastesson  resigned from his
role as head of commodities trading at SEB AB, Sweden’s third-
biggest bank by market value, to start his own commodity trading
advisory company.  Fastesson, 41, resigned from SEB on Nov. 1, he said today
by telephone. He joined SEB in October 2007 from Vattenfall AB,
the Nordic region’s biggest utility, to help develop the bank’s
commodity expansion. He also worked at Enron Corp.  Fastesson’s new company, preliminarily called  Commodity
Advisors , will focus on advising industrial consumers and
institutions on commodity risk management and trading, he said.  SEB AB appointed Terje Anderson as acting head of
commodities trading to replace Fastesson, Arne Boberg, head of
institutional commodities sales at the Stockholm-based bank,
said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
