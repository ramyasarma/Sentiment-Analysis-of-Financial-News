Deutsche Post AG , the world’s biggest
carrier of air and sea freight, opened talks with banks
including Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG to raise more than
1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in its first syndicated loan.  Deutsche Post is also negotiating with Commerzbank AG and
HSBC Holdings Plc to arrange the deal, said three people with
knowledge of the deal, who declined to be identified because the
talks are private.  “We’re looking at such a loan and it could well happen
this year,” Chief Financial Officer  Lawrence Rosen  said on a
conference call today, adding that it would be used to refinance
debt coming due in 2012 and 2014. It’s too early to say which
banks the company will hire to arrange the financing, which will
exceed 1 billion euros, he said.  Europe’s largest postal service is diversifying its funding
to replace more than 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of bonds.
Deutsche Post has 1 billion euros of 4.875 percent bonds
maturing in 2014 and 750 million euros of notes due in 2012,
Bloomberg data show. The company is ranked BBB+ by Standard &
Poor’s and Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Banks have cut interest margins to European companies rated
between BBB+ and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s to 78 basis points
this year from an average 142 basis points last year, according
to Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Deutsche Post, based in Bonn, said today third-quarter  net
income  was 226 million euros compared with a loss of 83 million
euros a year earlier. Profit topped the 215 million-euro average
estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
