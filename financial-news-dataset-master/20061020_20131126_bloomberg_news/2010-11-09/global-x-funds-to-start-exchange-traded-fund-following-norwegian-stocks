Global X Funds , a New York-based
provider of exchange-traded funds, will tomorrow start the first
ETF listed outside of Norway to track the country’s stocks.  The Global X FTSE Norway 30 ETF will follow the  FTSE Norway
30 Index  and is the company’s second exchange-traded fund giving
investors access to the Nordic market. The Global X FTSE Nordic
30 ETF began trading in August last year.  “Norway is a hard asset, strong currency play similar to
Canada or Australia,” said  Bruno del Ama , chief executive
officer of Global X Funds in a phone interview from New York.
“The country doesn’t use the euro, it has a heavy commodities
exposure and is one of the most stable economies in the world.”  With 4.9 million people, Norway is the world’s second-
richest country per capita. The nation is the second-largest gas
exporter and the seventh-biggest oil exporter. The FTSE Norway
30 Index has surged 18 percent this year, outperforming the 7.8
percent gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the 10 percent
advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The new ETF is “a very low-risk way to diversify your
exposure play while getting access to a very developed
economy,” said del Ama.  Global X Funds has also applied to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for approval of exchange-traded funds
tracking stocks in Denmark and Finland, del Ama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
