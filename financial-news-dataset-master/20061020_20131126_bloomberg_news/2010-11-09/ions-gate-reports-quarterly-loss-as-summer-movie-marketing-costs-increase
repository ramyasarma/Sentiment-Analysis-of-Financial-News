Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. , the
target of a hostile takeover bid by  Carl Icahn,  reported a
$29.7 million second-quarter loss as movie marketing costs rose.  The loss of 22 cents a share compared with a profit of
$31.7 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier, Vancouver-based
Lions Gate said today in a  statement . Sales rose 25 percent to
$456.3 million in the period ended Sept. 30, topping the $426.8
million average of nine analysts’  estimates .  Marketing costs increased with four summer releases
including the  Sylvester Stallone  action film “The Expendables”
and the horror movie “The Last Exorcism.” Studios must account
for marketing costs as they’re incurred, often before revenue
comes in, said  Matthew Harrigan , a Denver-based analyst with
Wunderlich Securities.  Icahn, 74, is attempting to buy the independent film and TV
studio for $7.50 a share and is suing over deals that have
hobbled the effort. A Canadian court on Nov. 1 rejected Icahn’s
suit to reverse an equity-for-debt swap that increased Lion Gate
board member  Mark Rachesky ’s stake to almost 29 percent.  Icahn, who owns almost 33 percent, is appealing that ruling
while pressing a similar case in New York.  Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, fell 6 cents
to $7.23 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
 trading  and has advanced 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
