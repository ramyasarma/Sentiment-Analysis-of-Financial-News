Copper topped $4 a pound, extending a
rally to a 28-month-high, as speculation mounted that the dollar
will weaken and as commodity prices surged.  The  greenback  has slumped 8.5 percent against a six-
currency basket since July 1 on concern that Federal Reserve
spending will spur inflation. The Fed said last week it will
purchase an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June
to bolster the U.S. economy. The  Thompson Reuters/CRB Index  of
19 raw materials rose for a ninth straight day, heading for the
longest uninterrupted advance since March 2005.  “Lingering misgivings” about the Fed’s move are “fueling
the general aversion away from paper currencies and into hard
assets,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in
Darien, Connecticut, said today in a report.  Copper futures for delivery in December added 8.65 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to close at $4.043 a pound at 1:35 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $4.0475, the
highest level since July 2, 2008.  The metal reached a record $4.2605 in May 2008.  “Copper fundamentals are exceptionally strong,” said
 Wayne Atwell , a managing director at Casimir Capital in New
York.  Prices will reach new highs within three months, driven by
strong demand from China, the world’s largest metals user, and a
dearth of new supplies, Atwell sad in a report yesterday. The
price will climb to $5 next year and $6 in 2012, he said.  The dollar fell as much as 0.4 percent before erasing
earlier losses.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $198, or 2.3 percent, to $8,858 a metric ton
($4.02 a pound).  Tin for three-month delivery rose $750, or 2.8 percent, to
$27,350 a ton on the LME, after earlier touching an all-time
high of $27,500. Lead advanced to a 10-month high, and zinc
gained 4.1 percent. Nickel and aluminum also rallied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
