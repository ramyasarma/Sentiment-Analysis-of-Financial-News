German stocks advanced, pushing the
benchmark DAX Index to a two-year high, as  Deutsche Post AG 
reported earnings that topped estimates.  Deutsche Post, Europe’s largest postal service, rallied 4.1
percent after also raising the lower end of its profit forecast.
Volkswagen AG and  Porsche SE  both gained more than 2 percent
after Lower Saxony Prime Minister  David McAllister  said the
merger risks are “manageable.” ThyssenKrupp AG followed metal
prices higher.  The DAX rose 0.6 percent to 6,787.81 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt. The measure increased 2.3 percent last week as the
U.S. Federal Reserve announced it will buy a further $600
billion of bonds in an attempt to bolster the world’s largest
economy. The broader HDAX Index gained 0.5 percent today.  “Many companies are coming out with good figures and
positive announcements,” said  Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein , an
equity strategist at Deutsche Postbank AG in Bonn. “Deutsche
Post earnings show worldwide logistics companies are on track.”  Deutsche Post  rallied 4.1 percent to 13.80 euros, the
largest advance in six months. Third-quarter net income was 226
million euros ($313 million), compared with a loss of 83 million
euros a year earlier, the Bonn-based company said. The average
estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for a profit
of 215 million euros.  VW, Porsche  Volkswagen and Porsche rose 2.4 percent to 111.45 and 7.2
percent to 43.54 euros, respectively.  Europe’s largest
carmaker ’s merger with Porsche is unlikely to be derailed by
U.S. investor lawsuits, even though its completion in 2011
appears “doubtful,” according to the German state shareholder
with veto power.  “It’s a very complicated process,” McAllister said in an
interview in Berlin. “I consider the judicial and financial
risks from the U.S. to be manageable. Nevertheless, caution
should take priority over haste, thoroughness over speed.”  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  added 2.8 percent to 54.91
euros as the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars said group
unit sales rose 12 percent in October to 128,593 cars and sport-
utility vehicles. Namesake brand sales also gained 12 percent.  ThyssenKrupp,  Germany’s biggest steelmaker , gained 1.9
percent to 28.38 euros as aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin
and zinc climbed on the London Metal Exchange.  Adidas Advances  Adidas AG surged 3.2 percent to 48.52 euros, the highest
close since January 2008. The world’s second-largest sporting-
goods maker has been trying out sales of a cheap shoe in
Bangladesh in an effort to boost its social responsibility image
and test new markets, Handelsblatt reported, citing an
unidentified company spokesman.  The company said yesterday it aims to increase sales as
much as 50 percent in the next five years.  Wincor Nixdorf AG jumped 8.2 percent to 56.95 euros, the
highest close since January 2008. The maker of automated teller
machines forecast an increase in operating profit and net sales
for the financial year 2010-2011. The stock was raised to
“add” from “hold” at Commerzbank AG, which said the company
“should benefit over-proportionally from a recovery of the
European business.”  DIC Asset AG dropped 2.7 percent to 7.56 euros as the
commercial property company said nine-month profit slid to 9.5
million euros from 11.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
