European stocks will likely return 20
percent including dividends in 2011 as improving lending
conditions boost earnings and economic growth, strategists at
Deutsche Bank AG wrote in a report today.  “Our strong GDP growth view is based on the non-consensus
argument that for credit to boost domestic demand growth, credit
growth needs to rise, but it does not need to be positive,” the
strategists wrote. “A slowdown in the pace of de-leveraging is
sufficient to drive strong GDP growth.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index may end next year at 315, the
note said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
