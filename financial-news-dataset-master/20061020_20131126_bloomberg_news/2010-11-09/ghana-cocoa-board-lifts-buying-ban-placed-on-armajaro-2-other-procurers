Ghana has lifted a ban placed on
three licensed cocoa-buying companies, including the local unit
of Armajaro, from operating in parts of the country’s biggest
growing region after allegations they were involved in
smuggling.  The companies have respected the ban, placed in April, and
had trained their staff on anti-smuggling, the Accra-based Ghana
Cocoa Board said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
