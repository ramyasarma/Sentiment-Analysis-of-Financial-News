Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the most
profitable Wall Street firm, will lend $25 million to a
nonprofit community-development organization to finance 16
charter schools in New York City and New Jersey.  The nonprofit group, Local Initiatives Support Corp., will
make the money available to the school operators during the next
two years, Goldman Sachs and LISC, both based in New York, said
today in a statement. The chairman of LISC, according to the
group’s website, is Robert E. Rubin, former U.S. Treasury
secretary.  Charter schools are nonsectarian, public institutions that
operate independently of local boards of education in the U.S.
under special charters. Goldman Sachs’s Urban Investment Group
has committed about $150 million for charter schools in New York
and New Jersey, according to the statement.  “By funding this facility, Goldman Sachs ensures that
thousands of low-income children will have access to innovative
local schools that also help revitalize blighted
neighborhoods,”  Michael Rubinger , president and chief executive
officer of LISC, said in the statement.  The financing may allow the charter schools involved to
obtain as much as $100 million in additional capital, according
to the statement.  LISC raises money to support community organizations that
work to revitalize urban and rural areas. The organization gives
grants, invests money, and underwrites loans to low-income
communities, and has provided $127 million in financing to 130
schools in the U.S. since 1997, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
