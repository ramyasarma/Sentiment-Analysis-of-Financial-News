The main securities exchanges in
Chile, Colombia and Peru plan to begin trialing cross-border
stock trading in an arrangement that may lead to the creation of
Latin America’s second-largest bourse by market value.  The three exchanges, which signed a definitive agreement in
Lima today, will begin testing with brokerages on Nov. 22 in a
system known as MILA, they said in an e-mailed statement.  In a second phase the three countries may establish a
common exchange in a bid to increase trading volume and lure
more foreign investors. The combined market value of the three
bourses is $657 billion compared with Mexico’s $464 billion and
Brazil’s $1.5 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
There is “no horizon” yet for direct trading on each exchange,
Colombian Securities Exchange President  Juan Pablo Cordoba  said.  “This is just stage one,” said  Rupert Stebbings , head of
the Colombian unit of Chilean brokerage Celfin Capital SA.
“Full integration is likely to take a couple of years more
owing to some significant differences in the tax regimes of each
country as well as oversight and of course deciding where the
home of the exchange will be.”  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
