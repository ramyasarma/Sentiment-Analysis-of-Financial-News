Vietnam, the second-largest rice
exporter, will ship more than 6.5 million metric tons of the
grain this year, the country’s agricultural minister said.   Production hasn’t been affected by floods, Cao Duc Phat,
the minister of agriculture and rural development, said at an
international rice conference in Hanoi today.   Rice exports reached a record 6 million tons in 2009,
government data show. The government has a target to ship
between 5.5 million and 6 million tons this year.  “The floods in Vietnam happened in the central part of the
country and at the end of the growing season, so they didn’t
hurt production very much,” Phat said. “Vietnam’s main rice-
growing area is in the south.”   Vietnam’s rice shipments totaled 5.7 million tons in the
January-to-October period, a 5.8 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
