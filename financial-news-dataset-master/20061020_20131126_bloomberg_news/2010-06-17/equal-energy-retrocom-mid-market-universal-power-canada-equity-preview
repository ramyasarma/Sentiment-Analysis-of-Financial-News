             Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in seven days after UBS AG cut its 2011 forecast for potash
prices and natural gas declined on concern U.S. stockpiles are
too high.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, the world’s largest
fertilizer producer, dropped 2.3 percent on the comments from
UBS analyst Joe Dewhurst. EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest natural
gas producer, lost 1 percent as the fuel decreased 3.2 percent.
Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s  largest gold producer , gained 2
percent as precious-metal futures climbed for a second day.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  retreated 18.38
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,927.59. The index was up the
entire day, dropping below yesterday’s close only as the stock
exchange adjusted at 4:10 p.m. for orders executed at the close
of trading. The benchmark has fallen 2.9 percent since April 26
on concern Europe’s debt crisis will curb world growth.  
 “Markets have been trading wildly at the close for weeks
now,” said  Derek Webb , president of Webb Asset Management Inc.
(USA) in San Francisco, which manages C$40 million ($39.2
million) for Canadian and U.S. clients. “Anytime there’s fear,
volatility goes up. We entered a fear cycle with Europe blowing
up.”  
 The S&P/TSX rallied 4.3 percent during its streak of gains,
which overlapped an eight-day run for the Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Commodity Price Index. Energy and raw-materials companies make
up 46 percent of Canadian stocks by market value.  
 Fertilizer Forecast  
 Potash Corp. declined 2.3 percent to C$101.10 after  Dewhurst  reduced his 2011 potash forecast to $370 a metric ton
from $450 a ton. Dewhurst wrote that potash, which traded at
more than $900 a ton in 2008, will remain below $550 a ton until
at least 2020.  
 Agrium Inc., Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer,
lost 1.4 percent to C$53.17.  
 Natural gas slumped a day after the U.S. Energy Department
reported supplies of 2.543 trillion cubic feet, 14 percent over
the five-year average. The fuel has surged 15 percent this month
as alternatives to offshore drilling for oil have received more
attention.  
 EnCana decreased 1 percent to C$35.24. Suncor Energy Inc.,
Canada’s largest oil and gas company, slipped 0.8 percent to
C$34.44. Enbridge Inc., the country’s biggest pipeline company,
retreated 1.1 percent to C$49.21.  
 Gold for August delivery rose 0.8 percent to $1,258.30 an
ounce after Chinese lawmaker Yin Zhongqing told a conference the
country should increase its holdings of precious metals and oil.  
 Mining Companies  
 Barrick gained for a fourth day, advancing 2 percent to
C$47.01. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-largest gold producer,
increased 0.8 percent to C$46.51. NovaGold Resources Inc., which
explores in the U.S. and Canada, surged 7.3 percent to C$7.67
the  biggest gain in the S&P/TSX .  
 Gammon Gold Inc., which operates in Mexico, decreased for a
sixth day, losing 4 percent to C$6.76 on a downgrade to
“neutral” from “buy” by UBS analyst  Dan Rollins . The company
slumped  9.3 percent  yesterday after saying it closed a mine
indefinitely due to a labor dispute.  
 Soft drink maker Cott Corp. had the biggest decline in the
S&P/TSX with a 8.8 percent retreat to C$7.39 after Stifel
Financial Corp. analyst  Mark Swartzberg  cut his rating on the
stock to “hold” from “buy.” Swartzberg told clients Wal-Mart
is selling other soft drinks at the same price or cheaper than
the Sam’s Choice private-label beverages Cott makes for the
retailer.  
 Forest-products company  Tembec Inc.  soared 28 percent, the
most in 14 months, to C$2.22. The company said earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization should rise to
C$47 million to C$53 million this quarter from C$32 million in
the quarter ended in March.
