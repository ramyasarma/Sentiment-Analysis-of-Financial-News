             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts rose to the highest level in almost 16 months
after minutes of the central bank’s monetary policy committee
meeting boosted speculation that borrowing costs will rise.  
 The yield on the contract due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, surged seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 11.27 percent, the highest level since Feb. 25, 2009.  
 The central bank sees “continued deterioration in the
dynamics of inflation,” according to the minutes of the June 9
meeting released today.  
 “The central bank was a little more aggressive and now
investors are consolidating their bets on interbank rates,”
said Deivis Ribeiro, a currency trader at Novacao SA Corretora
de Cambio in Sao Paulo. “People are now awaiting next week’s
inflation numbers to see if it stabilizes or heats up.”  
 Policy makers raised Brazil’s Selic rate 0.75 percentage
point for a second consecutive time at the June 9 meeting. The
yield on futures implies traders expect the central bank to
increase the  benchmark  by 0.75 percentage point for a third
consecutive time in July, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 The central bank’s comment about inflation “means the
process is not near its end,” wrote  Tony Volpon , strategist for
Latin America at Nomura Securities International Inc., in an e-
mailed note to clients today.  
 Brazil’s real rose 0.4 percent to 1.7802 per dollar, from
1.7873 yesterday.
