             A New Jersey rabbi pleaded guilty to
conspiring to launder $1.5 million in a U.S. corruption
crackdown that led to charges against 44 people last July.  
 Eliahu Ben Haim , once the principal rabbi of Congregation
Ohel Yaacob in Deal, New Jersey, today admitted that he used
religious charities to engage in 35 money-laundering
transactions with a cooperating witness. He converted $1.5
million in checks into $1.35 million in cash, keeping $150,000
in fees, according to a charge he admitted in federal court in
Trenton, New Jersey.  
 Ben Haim, who faces as many as 20 years in prison, remains
under house arrest on $1.5 million bail, with a global
positioning system to track him, according to a statement by
U.S. Attorney  Paul Fishman . He agreed to forfeit $1.5 million,
including $630,525 seized last July 23.  
 Ben Haim isn’t cooperating with prosecutors, his attorney,
 Lawrence Lustberg , said in an interview. Lustberg declined to
comment further.  
 Twenty people have been convicted after a sting by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation netted public officials, five
rabbis and a man accused of illegally dealing a human kidney.
Those convicted include a former state assemblyman and two
people not originally charged last July.  
 The case is United States of America v. Eliahu Ben Haim,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).
