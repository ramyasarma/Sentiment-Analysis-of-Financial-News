             The $20 billion that  BP Plc  will set
aside for claims from the worst oil spill in U.S. history
probably won’t be all the company ultimately must pay, President
 Barack Obama ’s senior energy and environment adviser said.  
 “It is likely that the number will be higher,”  Carol Browner  said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Conversations with  Judy Woodruff ,” airing this weekend.  
 BP agreed with Obama on June 16 to set up a $20 billion
compensation fund for victims of the environmental and economic
disaster caused by the explosion of its well in the Gulf of
Mexico. BP and the administration are struggling to stop the
flow of as much as 60,000 barrels of oil daily from the well.  
 BP should be able to contain as much as 90 percent of the
gushing crude in coming days or weeks, Obama said in a June 15
address televised from the Oval Office.  
 “We have pushed them very hard to improve that plan that
will get us to up to 90 percent of it captured while the relief
wells are being dug,” Browner said yesterday. BP is working to
complete relief wells by August that the company says provide
the only prospect of completely plugging the leak.  
 Browner also talked about Obama’s commitment to passing
energy legislation. The spill should spur new laws to “change
how we produce and use energy,” Obama said in his speech. He
didn’t insist that the Senate approve legislation passed by the
House last year with a cap-and-trade system in which companies
buy and sell a declining number of carbon dioxide allowances.  
 Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said
yesterday that the 59-member Democratic caucus is split on
putting a price on carbon.  
 “We need to work on that, and we need to see where members
are, and that is what we are going to do in the coming days and
weeks,” Browner said. “The president has always been clear
about the need to put a cap on carbon.”
