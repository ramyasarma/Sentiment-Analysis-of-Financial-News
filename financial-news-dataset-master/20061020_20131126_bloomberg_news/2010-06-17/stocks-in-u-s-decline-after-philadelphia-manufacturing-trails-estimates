             U.S. stocks dropped after a gauge of
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region trailed economists’
estimates, casting doubt on the strength of the economic
recovery.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,111.82 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average retreated 42.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,367.28.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index slumped to 8 in June from 21.4 the previous month.
Readings above zero signal growth. Economists forecast the index
would fall to 20, according the median of 58 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey.
