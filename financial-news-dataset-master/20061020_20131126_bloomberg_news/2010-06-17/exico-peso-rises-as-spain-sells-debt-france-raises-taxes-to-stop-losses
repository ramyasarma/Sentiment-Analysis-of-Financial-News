             Mexico’s peso fluctuated between
gains and losses as initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose in
the U.S., offsetting a move by France to raise taxes and Spain
selling bonds to deal with the European debt crisis.  
 The peso was little changed at 12.5937 per dollar at 11:41
a.m. New York time, from 12.5985 yesterday. The peso has gained
3.9 percent this year against the dollar, the best performance
among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “We are starting to see European economies every day
announce they are taking action to correct the situation,” said
 Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in Mexico
City. “These are being well received by the markets.”  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of bonds to
finance looming debt maturities today and the Bank of Spain said
it would publish the results of stress tests on the nation’s
lenders.  
 U.S. initial jobless claims rose to 472,000 last week, a
sign that firings remain elevated even as the economy recovers.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index dropped to a 10-month low of 8, less than half the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.28 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.1 centavo to 124.27 centavos per peso.
