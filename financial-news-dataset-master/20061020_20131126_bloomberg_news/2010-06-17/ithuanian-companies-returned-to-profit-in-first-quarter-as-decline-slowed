             Lithuanian businesses returned to
profit in the first quarter as the Baltic nation’s economic
decline slowed.  
 Total gross profit amounted to 703.6 million litai ($250
million), compared with a net loss of 3.1 billion litai in the
final three months of 2009, the Vilnius-based  statistics office 
said in a statement on its website today. Revenue fell an annual
4.6 percent, it said.  
 Earnings at Lithuanian companies have resumed growth as
exports recover and industrial output expands. The country’s
annual  economic decline  eased to 2.8 percent in the first
quarter from 12.1 percent in the previous period.  
 The share of companies that made a profit rose to 45
percent from 43.7 percent in the prior three months, the office
said.
