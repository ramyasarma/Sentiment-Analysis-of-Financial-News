             Posco , South Korea’s largest
steelmaker, agreed to buy a 7.8 percent stake in a coal mine in
Mozambique to secure supplies as raw material costs rise.  
 The mine may supply the steelmaker with 5 million metric
tons of coal a year starting from 2014, Chung Jae Woong, a
spokesman for Pohang-based Posco, said by phone today,
confirming a Yonhap News report. He declined to give the value
of the deal, the identity of the seller, or the type of coal the
mine will supply.  
 Chief Executive Officer Chung Joon Yang said in February he
will “aggressively” pursue mining investments, joining
ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker, in seeking to own
supplies of raw materials. Contract prices for coking coal, used
in steelmaking, will rise 12.5 percent in the July quarter, the
second gain this year, as Chinese demand drained global supplies.  
 Posco  fell 0.7 percent to 468,500 won at 10:55 a.m. in
Seoul trading, while the benchmark Kospi index was little
changed.  
 Posco, planning to invest about $5 billion in overseas
mines, earlier this year agreed to buy as much as a 15 percent
stake in the Roy Hill iron ore project in Australia.
