             German stocks  advanced for a fourth
day as Spain sold the maximum amount of bonds at an auction,
offsetting worse-than-forecast economic data that cast doubt on
the strength of the U.S. recovery.  
 Volkswagen AG  led a rally in carmakers as WestLB AG said
analysts will increase earnings estimates after the company said
yesterday operating profit will be “significantly exceeded” in
2010 from last year. Daimler AG and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG 
also rose.  
 The benchmark  DAX Index  climbed 0.5 percent to 6,223.54.
The gauge has rallied 9.8 percent since May 25 after concern
about the impact of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis pushed the
measure near its cheapest level relative to earnings in more
than a year. The broader HDAX Index also gained 0.5 percent
today.  
 “A successful Spanish bond auction earlier in the day has
helped to improve sentiment,” said  Joshua Raymond , a market
strategist at City Index Ltd. in London. This can “loosely be
interpreted as a vote of confidence in Spain.”  
 Spain sold 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of 10-year bonds
and 479.2 million euros of 30-year debt at auction today, the
Bank of Spain said. The Treasury had planned to sell a maximum
of 3.5 billion euros.  
 U.S. Economy  
 In the U.S., initial jobless claims rose by 12,000 to
472,000 last week, figures from the Labor Department showed
today. The median expectation of a Bloomberg survey of
economists was for a decline to 450,000. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index slumped to 8 in
June from 21.4 the previous month, below the economist forecast
of 20, according to the median of 58 projections in a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 Volkswagen  preferred shares rose 3.8 percent to 75.20
euros. Increases to analysts forecasts are “likely” after
yesterday’s statement from Europe’s largest carmaker, London-
based WestLB analyst  Adam Hull  wrote in a report today.  
 “This reflects VW sales in western Europe, the U.S. and
China being better than it expected and the positive impact of
the weaker euro,” he wrote.  
 Daimler and BMW, the world’s biggest makers of luxury cars,
gained 2.9 percent to 42.32 euros and 1.7 percent to 39.70
euros, respectively. Porsche Automobil Holding SE gained 5.3
percent to 34.60 euros.  
 The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts Index rose 2.3 percent
today, the best performance among 19  industry groups  in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
