             Poland’s Treasury Ministry may 
decide not to ask for a 2009 dividend from PKO Bank Polski SA, 
the country’s largest bank, to help it finance a possible 
takeover of Bank Zachodni WBK SA, which Allied Irish Banks Plc 
is trying to sell this year, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported, 
without saying where it got the information.   
 Maciej Wewior, the ministry’s spokesman, and Elzbieta 
Anders, PKO’s spokeswoman, declined to comment on the dividend,
the newspaper said.
