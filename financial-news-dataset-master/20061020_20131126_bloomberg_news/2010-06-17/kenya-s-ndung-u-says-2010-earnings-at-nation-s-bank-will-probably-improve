             Banks operating in Kenya are likely 
to achieve better results in 2010 than last year, Central Bank 
of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said.  
 The central bank and government of Kenya will continue to 
pursue policies that create a “conducive environment to allow 
the growth of the financial sector,” he said in a speech 
posted on the central bank’s website today.
