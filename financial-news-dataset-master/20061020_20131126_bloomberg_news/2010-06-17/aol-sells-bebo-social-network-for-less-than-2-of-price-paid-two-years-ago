             AOL Inc. , the Internet company spun
off from Time Warner Inc., sold its Bebo social-networking
service to Criterion Capital Partners LLC for less than 2
percent of what it paid for the site two years ago.  
 AOL, which paid $850 million for the site, got less than
$10 million for it, said a person familiar with the matter, who
declined to be identified since the price wasn’t made public.
AOL said in a  filing  today it expects to record a tax benefit
this quarter of $275 million to $325 million from the sale.  
 The New York-based Internet company said April 6 it was
weighing a sale or shutdown of Bebo. AOL said it wasn’t in a
position to fund a turnaround at Bebo after losing ground to
bigger social-networking rivals Facebook Inc. and  News Corp. ’s
MySpace. The price AOL paid for Bebo included $766 million of
goodwill, according to regulatory filings.  
 “Criterion Capital Partners are specialists in
facilitating growth plans and turnarounds,” AOL Chief Executive
Officer  Tim Armstrong  said today in a memo to employees. “For
AOL, the transaction will also create a meaningful tax
deduction.”  
 Criterion, a Los Angeles-based merchant-banking and
financial-advisory firm, said the deal was led by managing
partner Adam Levin, along with strategist Paul Abramowitz and
web entrepreneur Richard Hecker. Criterion will take over Bebo’s
global operations immediately and base the company out of San
Francisco, according to a statement from the firm today.  
 ‘Worthless’  
 Neither party will disclose the price, Criterion said.
Criterion executives, including Levin, weren’t available to
comment, said Jason Damata, an outside spokesman.  
 TechCrunch reported yesterday that Bebo was sold for $10
million or less.  
 AOL said it will treat the common stock of Bebo as
“worthless” for tax purposes. The tax benefit from the sale is
subject to review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. AOL said
it will also test its goodwill for possible impairment charges
this quarter.  
 AOL may begin to use the tax shield immediately and
increase free cash flow “materially,”  Clay Moran , an analyst
with Benchmark Co., said today in a report.  
 AOL, which publishes sites such as MapQuest, Politics Daily
and Lemondrop.com, rose 37 cents to $22.65 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have lost 3.7
percent since the Dec. 10 spinoff from Time Warner.  
 Risky Acquisition  
 Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes has said he may have overpaid
for Bebo, calling the May 2008 purchase the company’s
“riskiest.” Bebo, founded in 2005, was bought when  Randy Falco 
and  Ron Grant  were still running AOL. They left in March 2009
when Armstrong was named CEO.  
 Bebo’s worldwide unique visitors plunged more than 50
percent to 12.6 million in April from a year ago, according to
ComScore Inc. Facebook had 519.1 million unique visitors in
April, and MySpace drew 111.2 million.  
 AOL committed in April to offer Bebo’s U.S. employees
severance agreements to remain with the business until a
strategic decision was reached, according to AOL spokeswoman
 Tricia Primrose . AOL agreed to pay this severance to employees
who stayed during the review period regardless of whether AOL
decided to shut down or sell Bebo, she said.  
 “Substantially all” of Bebo was sold, with the exception
of the division’s cash, some contracts and some furnishings in
leased office spaces, Primrose said.
