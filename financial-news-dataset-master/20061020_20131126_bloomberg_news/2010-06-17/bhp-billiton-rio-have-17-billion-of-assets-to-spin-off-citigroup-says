             BHP Billiton Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto
Group , the world’s largest and third-largest mining companies,
have the potential to spin out $17 billion of assets that
contribute a limited portion of earnings, Citigroup Inc. said.  
 “These assets could be viewed as non-core and there may be
the potential to sell or spin those assets out into the
market,” Citigroup analyst  Craig Sainsbury  said in a report
dated yesterday. “There is over $17 billion of net present
value within the assets.”  
 BHP’s Worsley alumina refinery has a net present value of
$2.6 billion and accounts for about 1 percent of the  company’s
earnings , Citigroup said. OZ Minerals Ltd. and New Hope Corp.
Ltd. could be potential buyers, Sainsbury said. Rio’s Palabora
copper and gold operation has a value of $974 million and OZ
Minerals could be a potential buyer, according to the report.
