             Lowering Japan’s corporate tax rate
could add 1.1 percent to  gross domestic product  in 10 years by
spurring consumer and corporate investment, according to Dai-
Ichi Life Research Institute.  
 The amount, which is equivalent to 5.9 trillion yen ($65
billion) of GDP, could be achieved if Japan’s 41 percent
corporate tax rate is slashed by 10 percentage points, Chie
Umezaki, Tokyo-based economist at Dai-Ichi Life, wrote in a
report published yesterday.  
 The ruling Democratic Party of Japan will today pledge in
its election platform to reduce corporate levies to spur growth
in the world’s second-largest economy, the Nikkei newspaper
reported today, without citing anyone. Tax cuts may compel Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  to pursue other revenue sources to make up
for reduced collections from companies, Dai-Ichi Life said.  
 “Lowering corporate tax is unavoidable to ensure growth in
the longer term,” Umezaki wrote. “The government has to decide
how to solve funding issues to allow it to cut corporate taxes
as soon as possible.”  
 Still, the growth generated won’t be enough to make up for
a decline in revenues obtained from companies, the report said.
The government will only make up for 64 percent of the lost
revenue over 10 years, Dai-Ichi Life said.  
 Kan has initiated debate on whether to raise the country’s
5 percent sales tax.
