             Toyota Motor Corp.  said a strike at
its supplier joint venture in China is over, according to Toyota
spokeswoman  Mieko Iwasaki .  
 “We heard the strike is over,” said Iwasaki. “There is
no impact on operations as of now.”  
 Toyota told its suppliers that it may be forced to stop an
assembly line in northern China’s Tianjin as early as today
because of a walk-out at a parts factory in the city, the Asahi
newspaper reported today.  
 The industrial action took place at a joint venture
factory that makes door parts and is run by Toyota 
affiliate  Toyoda Gosei Co. , said Niu Yu a Beijing-based 
spokesman for the automaker.
