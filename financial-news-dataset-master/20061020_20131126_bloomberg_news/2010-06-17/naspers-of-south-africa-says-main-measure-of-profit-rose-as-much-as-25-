             Naspers Ltd. , Africa’s biggest media
company, said annual profit fell by 40 percent to 50 percent
from a year earlier when the sale of a pay-television unit in
Greece boosted earnings.  
 Earnings per share will be as low as 7.77 rand per share in
the year through March compared with 15.53 rand a year earlier,
the Cape Town-based company said in a statement to
Johannesburg’s stock exchange news service today. Naspers owns
print and electronic news media in South Africa, China, Brazil,
India and Russia.  
 Core headline earnings, which the company regards as its
best performance measure, will increase by between 15 and 25
percent from 11.79 rand a year earlier, it said. A  median
forecast  by 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg put adjusted
earnings at 14.20 rand. The sale of the Greece unit caused a
once-off accounting profit a year earlier, Naspers said.  
 The company had its  stock recommendation  lowered to
“neutral” from “buy” at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research,
which said June 4 that likely investments in new businesses
would weigh on earnings and internet profits were “mediocre.’”  
 Naspers  gained  75 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 272.25 rand in
Johannesburg, giving a market value of 111 billion rand ($14.6
billion).
