             Most Asian  stock markets  rose as
gains among phone and energy stocks overshadowed declines by
export-reliant companies on concern a global economic recovery
will stall.  
 Reliance Communications Ltd.  climbed 2.4 percent after the
Hindu BusinessLine reported the company is considering selling
part of a unit. Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore oil
producer, and India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. gained at least
1.9 percent on brokerages recommendations.  Toyota Motor Corp. 
declined 1.1 percent in Tokyo and  James Hardie Industries SE ,
the biggest seller of home siding in the U.S., lost 3.8 percent
in Sydney after U.S. housing starts dropped.  
 “Investors are taking a cautious approach,” said  Nader Naeimi , a strategist in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors, which
holds $90 billion. “The market has had to deal with a lot of
bad news. From an earnings point of view, people are hopeful.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  was little changed at 115.64 as
of 7:39 p.m. in Tokyo after five consecutive gains pushed the
gauge to a four-week high yesterday. About as many stocks
declined as advanced. The index has lost 4.1 percent this year
on concern that Greece and other European countries will
struggle to curb their budget deficits and repay debt.  
 India’s Sensitive Index gained 0.9 percent and Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index advanced 0.4 percent. China’s  Shanghai Composite
Index  dropped 0.4 percent as trading resumed following a holiday.
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  declined 0.7 percent. Australia,
Singapore and New Zealand were the only other markets to drop in
the region.  
 U.S. Futures Drop  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.3 percent.
The gauge slipped 0.06 percent yesterday in New York. A Commerce
Department report showed housing starts fell 10 percent in May,
the biggest slump since March 2009. FedEx Corp., the world’s
largest air-cargo carrier, also forecast earnings that trailed
analyst estimate.  
 Reliance Communications , India’s second-largest wireless
carrier, added 2.4 percent to 191.7 rupees. The company is
considering raising cash by selling as much as 26 percent of its
Reliance Globalcom unit, which owns a private undersea cable
system, Hindu BusinessLine reported. The sale may fetch as much
as $500 million, the report said.  
 Oil & Natural Gas, India’s largest state-owned oil explorer,
gained 1.9 percent to 1,186.05 rupees after it was rated a new
“buy” at Deutsche Bank AG by analyst  Harshad Katkar .  
 Cnooc , the biggest boost to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index,
climbed 2.3 percent to HK$13.42 after HSBC Holdings Plc boosted
the company to “overweight” from “neutral.”  
 Home Starts  
 Nintendo Co., the world’s No. 1 maker of portable video-
game players, rose 5.2 percent to 27,890 yen after UBS boosted
its rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral.” Nintendo
jumped 5.2 percent yesterday after the company introduced a new
handheld video-game player this week.  
 In Sydney,  James Hardie Industries  lost 3.8 percent to
A$6.76.  Building permits  in the U.S., a sign of future
construction, unexpectedly declined to a one-year low, a report
from the Commerce Department showed. Single-family-home starts
dropped by the most since 1991.  
 Toyota, which gets about 28 percent of its sales from North
America, fell 1.1 percent to 3,295 yen.  Sony Corp. , a maker of
electronics that gets 21 percent of its sales in the U.S.,
slipped 2.8 percent to 2,564 yen. Panasonic Corp., which gets 48
percent of its revenue abroad, lost 2.6 percent to 1,223 yen.  
 Europe’s Debt Crisis  
 A stronger yen helped drag Japanese exporters lower today
as it threatened to cut the value of overseas income when
repatriated. The yen strengthened to as much 111.65 against the
euro today from 112.78 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in
Tokyo, and appreciated to 91.14 per dollar from 91.47.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has slumped 10 percent from its
high this year on April 15 as swelling budget deficits prompted
Standard & Poor’s to cut ratings of Greece, Spain and Portugal.
The retreat has driven down the average price of shares in the
gauge to 14.7 times  estimated earnings . The ratio sank to 13.8
times on May 18, the lowest level since December 2008.  
 “People are nervous,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in
Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about $307
billion. “Investors can’t be bullish enough to bet on
improvements in the global economy and to buy risk assets.”  
 Mining shares dropped after the  London Metal Exchange Index 
of six industrial metals slid 0.4 percent yesterday, its first
decline in six days. Copper in New York slipped 0.5 percent,
halting a six-session rally. Futures fell 1.5 percent today.  
 Henderson Land  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
dropped 1.1 percent to A$38.82 in Sydney and was the heaviest
drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific index.  Rio Tinto Group , the
world’s third-biggest mining company, fell 1.8 percent to
A$70.07. Mitsubishi Corp., which gets about 40 percent of its
sales from commodities, slid 0.6 percent to 1,920 yen in Tokyo.  
 In Hong Kong, Henderson Land Development Co. fell 2.3
percent to HK$46.70, the biggest drop on the Hang Seng Index.
The property developer said it will take a charge of HK$734
million ($94 million) after prospective buyers canceled
purchases of 20 luxury flats were canceled. Credit Suisse Group
AG cut its  rating  to “neutral” from “outperform.’
