             France Telecom SA can reach its aim
of doubling sales in emerging markets in three years, quicker
than the announced timeframe of five years, Chief Executive
Officer Stephane Richard told Les Echos in an interview.  
 To meet the goal, the company needs to purchase 2 billion
euros of revenue, by buying either licenses or assets, Richard
was cited as saying.  
 France Telecom’s favored area for expansion is Africa,
where per head GDP will this year exceed that of India, Richard
told Les Echos.
