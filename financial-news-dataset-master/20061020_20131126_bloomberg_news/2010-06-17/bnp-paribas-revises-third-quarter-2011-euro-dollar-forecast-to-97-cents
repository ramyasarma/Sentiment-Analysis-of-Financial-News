             BNP Paribas SA revised its third-
quarter 2011 euro forecast against the dollar to 97 U.S. cents
from $1.07.  
 “We are convinced that euro-dollar will have to remain
weaker for longer,” currency strategists led by London-based
Hans-Guenter Redeker, wrote in a research report today. “A weak
euro will help Europe generate the required income to deal with
the financial consequences of the crisis. Moreover, the ECB will
have to keep interest rates low to deal with the deflationary
consequences of closing the inner EMU competitive gap.”  
 The euro traded 0.4 percent higher at $1.2357 as of 4:11
p.m. in London. It will reach $1 in the first quarter of 2011,
BNP said, repeating an earlier forecast.
