             The surplus cash with the Indian
government is a “temporary phenomenon” and expenditure will
pick up by the end of this month with the onset of monsoon, a
finance ministry official who didn’t wish to be named, told
reporters in New Delhi. The borrowing schedule for the current
financial year remains “as it is,” he said.
