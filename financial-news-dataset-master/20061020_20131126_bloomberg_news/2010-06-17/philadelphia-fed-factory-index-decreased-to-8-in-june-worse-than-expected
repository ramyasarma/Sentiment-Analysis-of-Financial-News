             The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s  general economic index  slumped to 8 in June from
21.4 the previous month. Readings above zero signal growth.  
 Economists forecast the index would fall to 20, according
to the median of 58 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.
Estimates ranged from 10 to 24.  
 The figures follow a report from the Labor Department today
that showed consumer prices fell in May for a second month. The
Labor Department also said  jobless claims  rose by 12,000 to
472,000 last week.
