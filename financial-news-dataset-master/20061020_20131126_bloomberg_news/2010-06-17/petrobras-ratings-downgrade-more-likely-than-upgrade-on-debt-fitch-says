             Petroleo Brasileiro SA , the state-
controlled oil company, is more likely to get a ratings
downgrade than upgrade as government intervention and debt rise,
said  Jose Luis Villanueva , a director at Fitch Ratings Ltd.  
 “The probability of a positive rating action is lower than
a negative rating action,” he told investors in New York today.  
 Brazil’s Senate approved rules this month that give
Petrobras a minimum 30 percent stake in all new oil projects in
the so-called pre-salt region of the South Atlantic. Previously
foreign oil companies competed with Petrobras in licensing
rounds, and companies including  Chevron Corp. ,  Exxon Mobil Corp .
and  Repsol YPF SA  operate deepwater projects in Brazil.  
 Villanueva said Fitch, which rates Petrobras BBB with a
stable outlook, sees “leverage” as a potential risk. Petrobras
is looking to keep its debt-to-equity ratio below 35 percent and
does not have any plans to issue debt this year to keep its
investment grade rating, Chief Executive Officer Jose  Sergio Gabrielli  said in an April 30 interview.  
 The company plans to raise as much as $25 billion from
minority investors next month in a share sale to finance up to
$220 billion in investments through 2014, the largest spending
plan of any oil company.
