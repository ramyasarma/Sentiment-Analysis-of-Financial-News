             Eruopean stocks erased earlier gains
after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index slumped to 8 in June from 21.4 the previous
month, missing economists’ forecasts.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at
254.42 at 3:02 p.m. in London, after earlier rising as much as
0.7 percent.
