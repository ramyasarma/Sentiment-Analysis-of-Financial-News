             Some investment banks in India are
reluctant to participate in the proposed sale of a government
stake in Hindustan Copper Ltd. on concern that the company’s
share price is too high and will deter investors, the Economic
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd., IDBI Capital Market Services
Ltd. and IDFC-SSKI Ltd. are the only banks that offered to sell
Hindustan shares, even after the government twice extended the
deadline for banks to submit such bids, according to the report.
