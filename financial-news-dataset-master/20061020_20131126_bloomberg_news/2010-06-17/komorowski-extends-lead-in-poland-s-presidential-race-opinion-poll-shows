             Acting Polish President Bronislaw 
Komorowski led Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the opposition
Law & Justice party, by 41 percent to 29 percent before the 
first round of presidential elections set for June 20, TVN24 
television reported on its website late yesterday, citing a 
June 16 survey by MillwardBrown SMG/KRC.  
 Support for Komorowski, the candidate of the ruling Civic 
Platform party, was unchanged from the previous poll on June 
14, while Kaczynski lost 3 percentage points. According to the 
survey, Komorowski would defeat Kaczynski by 54 percent to 34 
percent in a two-candidate runoff, with the remaining voters 
undecided or not planning to cast ballots in the second round.
