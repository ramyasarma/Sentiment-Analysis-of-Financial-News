             HSBC Holdings Plc  may raise as
much as $10 billion by selling new shares in Shanghai next year,
Matrix Corporate Capital LLP analyst  Andrew Lim  said.  
 “We do not expect any capital raised to be used for
growth,” Lim wrote today in an e-mailed note to  investors .
“The capital would merely plug the capital shortfall” faced by
the bank under new regulations, said Lim, who has a “sell”
rating on the stock.  
 The increase in capital would boost the bank’s Core Tier 1
ratio, a measure of financial strength, to 7.3 percent at the
end of 2012, which is “more in line with its peers,” Lim
wrote. Under the Basel III regulations, HSBC’s 2009 Core Tier 1
ratio will be 5.1 percent, he said.  
 Banks globally may need to raise as much as $375 billion to
increase capital and liquidity under Basel III rules, which may
be introduced by the end of 2012, according to an estimate by
UBS AG analysts. HSBC hired China International Corp. and Citic
Securities to advise on raising more than $5 billion in
Shanghai, people familiar with the situation said last August.
