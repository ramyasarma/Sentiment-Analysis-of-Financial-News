             Swiss lawmakers approved a UBS AG
tax treaty with the U.S., ending a two-year legal tussle that
threatened the bank’s American business.  
 The agreement, through votes in both chambers of
Parliament, came after week-long negotiations between the upper
and the lower house in which deputies dropped a demand for the
treaty to be opened to a nationwide referendum.
