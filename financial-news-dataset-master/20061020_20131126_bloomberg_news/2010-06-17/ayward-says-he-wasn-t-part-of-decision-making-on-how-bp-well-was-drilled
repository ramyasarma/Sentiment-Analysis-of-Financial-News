             BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Tony
Hayward told lawmakers he didn’t take part in decisions on
drilling the well in the Gulf of Mexico that blew out,
triggering the worst U.S. oil spill.  
 “I wasn’t involved in any of that decision making,”
Hayward said today at a hearing of a House Energy Committee
panel. “It’s clear that there were some discussions among the
engineering team and that an engineering judgment was taken.”
