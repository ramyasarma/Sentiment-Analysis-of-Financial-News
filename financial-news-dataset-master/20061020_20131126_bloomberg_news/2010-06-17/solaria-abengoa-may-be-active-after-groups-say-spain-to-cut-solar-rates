             Solaria Energia y Medio Ambiente SA 
shares were little changed after a trade group said the Spanish
government will cut revenue for plants that produce electricity
from photovoltaic panels.  
 Shares in Solaria, a solar-panel operator, fell 1 cent, or
0.6 percent, to 1.71 euros in Madrid as of 10:08 a.m. local
time. The stock has lost 32 percent this year as investors
avoided the company after the government said it will cut solar
energy prices.  
 Spain plans to cut the revenue of existing solar-panel
installations by 30 percent by reducing the number of hours a
day during which they may earn subsidized prices for clean
energy, said  Tomas Diaz , director of external relations at the
Photovoltaic Industry Association in Madrid.  
 Solar executives, whose companies have invested more than
18 billion euros ($22 billion) in the last three years in Spain,
have pressed the government for weeks to maintain prices
guaranteed for 25 years under a 2007 law.  
 A spokesman for the industry ministry who asked not to be
identified by name declined to comment yesterday. The ministry
has yet to make public the scale of its proposed reductions.
