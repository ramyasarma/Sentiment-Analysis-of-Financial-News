             The Batu Hijau copper and gold mine,
operated by an Indonesian venture of  Newmont Mining Corp. , may
produce 10 percent to 20 percent less than expected this year
because of heavy rainfall, a government official said.  
 “Sales won’t be affected by the decline in output as
Newmont has sufficient stockpiles to cover the fall,” Witoro
Soelarno, secretary of the minerals, coal and geothermal
directorate general at the energy ministry, told reporters today
in Jakarta, without giving the targeted output.  
 Moderate and heavy rains were forecast in parts of
Indonesia for the week through June 21, according to the
 Meteorological, Geophysics and Climatology Agency . The Batu
Hijau mine may produce 573 million pounds of copper in 2010, up
from 479 million pounds in 2009,  Martiono Hadianto , president of
PT Newmont Pacific Nusantara, the local unit, said Nov. 30.
