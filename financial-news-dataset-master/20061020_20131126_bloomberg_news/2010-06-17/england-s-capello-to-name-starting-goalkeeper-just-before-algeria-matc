             England coach  Fabio Capello  won’t
name his goalkeeper until two hours before today’s game with
Algeria, leaving  Robert Green , whose mistake allowed the U.S.’s
goal in a 1-1 opening World Cup match, in limbo.  
 Capello said the new Adidas soccer ball has caused problems
for goalkeepers. Green, whose miscue came on a long shot from
 Clint Dempsey , had started England’s next-to-last warmup match
against Mexico, a 3-1 win at Wembley in London.  
 “When I chose Green he was in a good moment after the game
they played against Mexico,” the coach told reporters yesterday.
“I saw some keepers make mistakes: the problem is the ball. The
bounce of the ball sometimes is higher. I think the result after
the mistake of the keeper was good. I lost some games after one
mistake.”  
 England and the U.S. are tied for second place in Group C,
which is led by Slovenia, a 1-0 winner against Algeria in the
other group opener. England plays the northern Africans in the
last game of the day, which opens with Germany taking on Serbia
in Group D. The U.S. meets Slovenia in between.  
 “Algeria scored a lot of goals,” Capello said. “They are
very dangerous when they play free kicks and corners. I saw all
the games they played. Not one game was easy. It would be a big
mistake to think that this game will be easy.”  
 England captain  Steven Gerrard  said he expects to play a
more attacking role against Algeria. Gerrard scored England’s
goal against the U.S.  
 Yesterday, Mexico beat France 2-0 in their World Cup Group
A match in Polokwane, South Africa.  Gonzalo Higuain  scored three
goals as Argentina beat South Korea 4-1 and Greece rallied to
defeat 10-man Nigeria 2-1 in Group B matches.
