             Oil fell for the first time in four
days after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose and
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region missed forecasts,
casting doubt on the strength of the economic recovery.  
 Crude dropped from a six-week high as the Labor Department
said the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits last week
climbed to a one-month high. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s  general economic index  decreased in June to the
lowest level since August.  
 “The Philadelphia Fed and the jobless claims are sparking
concerns about economic growth and the resulting energy demand
or lack thereof,” said  Kyle Cooper , a managing director at
energy consultant IAF Advisors in Houston.  
 Crude oil for July delivery lost 88 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $76.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures have risen 8.1 percent in the past year.  
 Initial jobless  applications  increased by 12,000 to 472,000
in the week ended June 12. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected 450,000 claims, according to the median forecast. The
number of people receiving unemployment insurance rose, while
those getting extended benefits dropped.  
 The Philadelphia Fed’s index dropped to 8 this month from
21.4 in May. Readings above zero indicate growth in the regional
gauge, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey
and Delaware. Economists forecast a decrease to 20, according to
the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Equities Fall  
 “When the jobless numbers came out, the S&P turned
downward and seemed to take crude along with it,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.3 percent to
1,111.07, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 25.32
points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,384.14 at 3:36 p.m. in New York.  
 The index of leading U.S. indicators, a gauge of the
outlook for growth over the next three to six months, climbed
0.4 percent in May, according to data from the New York-based
Conference Board, signaling the world’s largest economy will
keep expanding in the second half of the year.  
 Oil dropped as gasoline and heating oil climbed after
 Valero Energy Corp.  shut the sole fluid catalytic cracker at its
McKee refinery in the Texas Panhandle. The gasoline-making unit,
which processes 55,000 barrels a day of oil, will close at least
until the middle of July, said  Bill Day , a Valero spokesman.  
 “The refinery outage is putting pressure on crude along
with the jobless claims number today,” said  Ray Carbone ,
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  
 Products Increase  
 Gasoline for July delivery gained 1.88 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.164 a gallon on the Nymex. Heating oil for July
delivery jumped 3.73 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.1474 a gallon.  
 The hypothetical profit margin, or  crack spread , to refine
three barrels of oil into two of gasoline and one of heating
oil, based on July futures prices, surged to a four-week high.
The spread gained $1.9286 to $13.8656 a barrel.  
 “With the weakness in crude, the cracks are blowing out
today,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York.  
 Fuel consumption fell 0.9 percent to the lowest level in
five weeks in the seven days ended June 11, according to an
Energy Department report yesterday.  
 Oil inventories were 8.4 percent above their five-year
average last week, an increase from 7.3 percent the week before.
Supplies gained 1.69 million barrels, or 0.5 percent, to 363.1
million last week, the department said. It was the first
increase in three weeks as imports climbed and refinery
operations declined.  
 Supplies  
 “There is no fundamental support here,” said  Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of energy at MF Global in New York.  
 Brent crude for August settlement rose 54 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $78.68 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will trim
shipments this month amid high inventories and slack demand in
Europe and North America, according to a report today by tanker-
tracker  Oil Movements .  
 OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of the world’s
crude, will ship 23.58 million barrels a day in the four weeks
to July 3, down 0.3 percent from 23.66 million a day during the
period to June 5, the consultant said. The data exclude Ecuador
and Angola.  
 An offshore drilling moratorium in the wake of the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill could trim U.S. production by 200,000 barrels a
day next year, eventually add $5 or more to the price of oil and
cause the U.S. to seek more foreign crude,  Adam Sieminski , chief
energy economist for Deutsche Bank, said today on Bloomberg
television.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 695,967
contracts as of 3:36 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 705,198
contracts yesterday, 9.8 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.33 million contracts.
