             Massachusetts , whose reserve
dwindled by more than half last year, plans to sell $250 million
in fixed-rate, tax-exempt bonds with yields at an eight-week
high.  
 The state’s 10-year general obligation yield rose to  3.48
percent  yesterday, the highest since April 20, according to
Bloomberg Fair Market Value data. The yield difference over top-
rated obligations  widened  4 basis points to 27 basis points in
the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Massachusetts  reduced  its reserve from $2.1 billion to $841
million in the year that ended in June 2009 as the U.S.
recession sapped revenue, according to Moody’s Investors Service
in a report yesterday.  
 “Significant use of reserves to close fiscal 2009 budget
gap has reduced financial flexibility, although a sizeable
reserve still remains,” Moody’s said. “A larger portion of
those reserves are still available compared to other large
states at this rating level.”  
 Moody’s and Fitch Ratings both grade the state’s debt
second-highest, at Aa1 and AA+, respectively. Standard & Poor’s
today rated the issue one step lower, at AA.  
 “Revenue adjustments have been frequent and gap-closing
actions have been swift, successfully restoring balance,” S&P
analyst  Robin Prunty  said in a report.  
 Fourth-Largest Deal  
 The week’s fourth-largest tax-exempt deal comes the month
after Congress stripped a provision from legislation that would
have extended about $24 billion of Medicaid payments beyond Dec.
31. Massachusetts, which incorporated the anticipated federal
aid in its budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, now
faces a $687 million deficit, according to state Senator  Steven A. Panagiotakos , a Democrat from Lowell.  
 “Investors may be taking pause, trying to wait this out
and get more clarification on how it’s going to affect
individual states,” said  Richard Ciccarone , chief research
officer of Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonnell Investment
Management, which oversees $7 billion of municipal debt.  
 Average yields on tax-exempt, 10-year debt have jumped 7
basis points in the past week, according to Municipal Market
Advisors. Yesterday,  top-rated debt  fell for the first time in a
week, slipping 1 basis point to 3.19 percent.  
 In Massachusetts’s most recent issue of tax-exempt general
obligations, in May 2009, debt maturing in 2019 was priced to
yield 3.08 percent, with investors paying more than 116 cents on
the dollar. The yield was 2 basis points below  similar-maturity 
AAA general obligations, according to Bloomberg Fair Market
Value Data.  
 Those securities traded June 15 at an average yield of 3.14
percent, 19 basis points above top-rated debt of similar
maturity, according to  the benchmark .  
 Individual Investors  
 More than half of the $2.4 billion in debt the commonwealth
sold in 2009 was bought by individual investors even amid
volatile market conditions, said Colin McNaught, the state’s
assistant treasurer for debt management. Top-rated 10-year debt
started 2009 yielding about 3.91 percent and touched 2.95
percent in October, the lowest since at least 1996, according to
MMA data.  
 This week’s sale is the last issue for Massachusetts this
fiscal year, McNaught said. The state plans $1.625 billion in
debt sales during the 2011 fiscal year.  
 Following are descriptions of pending sales of municipal
debt in the U.S.:  
 PUERTO RICO HIGHWAY AUTHORITY , which oversees 4,635 miles
of roads, plans to reoffer $297.9 million in tax-exempt revenue
refunding bonds as soon as next week. The floating-rate
securities were originally issued in 1998, maturing in 2026, and
in 2003, maturing in 2035. The new, fixed-rate bonds are backed
by gasoline taxes, a portion of vehicle licensing fees and toll
revenue. Jefferies & Co. is leading the group underwriting the
deal. (Added June 16)  
 GUAM POWER AUTHORITY, which serves 47,000 customers in the
westernmost U.S. territory, plans to sell $146.5 million in
revenue bonds as soon as next week. The debt is rated BBB, the
second-lowest investment grade, by S&P and will be split into
tax-exempts and taxable Build America Bonds. The deal is led by
Morgan Stanley and may also include $55.3 million of a
subordinate lien tranche rated BBB-, the lowest investment
grade, according to S&P. Proceeds of the sale will go to
refunding debt, so-called smart-grid technology and projects
such as a new administrative building. (Added June 17)  
 ALAMOGORDO , the New Mexico city nearest to the site of the
first nuclear tests in the U.S., plans to issue $89 million in
debt as soon as next week. The deal is split into $73.1 million
of tax-exempts that mature from 2022 through 2026, in 2030, 2035
and 2040 and $16.3 million of taxable securities that mature
serially from 2011 through 2022. Marketing will be led by Morgan
Keegan Inc. and proceeds will go to refunding improvement bonds
for the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center. The securities
are rated BBB+, third-lowest, by S&P. (Added June 17)  
 PUERTO RICO SALES TAX FINANCING CORP., created in 2006 to
help the island commonwealth lower borrowing costs, plans to
offer $1.4 billion in tax-exempt revenue bonds as soon as next
week. The bonds, rated the fifth-highest level at A1 by Moody’s
and A+ by S&P, will be marketed by a group led by Citigroup Inc.
The securities are backed by 1.5 percentage points of the
state’s 5.5 percent sales tax and will refund debt from 2007,
2008 and 2009. (Added June 17)
