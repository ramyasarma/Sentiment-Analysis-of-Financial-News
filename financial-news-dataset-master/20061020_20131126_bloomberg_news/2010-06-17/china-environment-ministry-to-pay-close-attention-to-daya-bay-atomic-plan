             China’s Environment Ministry said it
is paying close attention to the small leakage from a fuel rod
last month at the Daya Bay nuclear power station.  
 The ministry said that the station’s number 2 reactor has
more than 40,000 fuel rods and it’s “normal” for some of those
to be damaged, according to a statement posted on its website
yesterday.  
 The reactor is now operating normally and radiation levels
have “normalized,” according to the statement. The ministry’s
nuclear safety bureau will urge the power station to take
“effective measures” to ensure the safe operation of the
plant, according to the statement.
