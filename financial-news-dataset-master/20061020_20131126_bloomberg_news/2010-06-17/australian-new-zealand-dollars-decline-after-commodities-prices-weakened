             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars declined as prices weakened for commodities that
comprise more than half of the South Pacific nations’ exports.  
 The Australian dollar fell to 86.05 U.S. cents as of 10:17
a.m. in Sydney from 86.40 cents yesterday in New York. The New
Zealand currency slid 0.3 percent to 69.57 cents.
