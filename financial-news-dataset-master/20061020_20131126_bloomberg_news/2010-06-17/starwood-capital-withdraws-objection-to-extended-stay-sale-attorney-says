             Starwood Capital Group LLC withdrew
its objection to  Extended Stay Inc. ’s planned sale to
Centerbridge Partners LP, Paulson & Co. and Blackstone Group LP,
removing an obstacle to the $3.9 billion deal.  
 Bruce Zirinsky , a lawyer for Starwood, said at a court
hearing today that the firm would drop its opposition to the
sale, which is intended to be the basis of Extended Stay’s exit
from bankruptcy.  
 Starwood had objected to the sale after losing an auction
for the company last month. Zirinsky said Starwood was reserving
its right to press ahead with its competing restructuring plan
for Spartanburg, South Carolina-based  Extended Stay .  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  James Peck  in Manhattan is
considering whether Extended Stay can move forward with the
planned sale and send its reorganization plan to creditors for a
vote. The hearing is continuing.  
 At the start of the hearing, Zirinsky complained that
certain auction rules chilled bidding for the company. Peck
countered that the auction appeared to be “fairly conducted.”  
 Peck said that, as far as he could tell, “everything
happened at the time the way it should have.”  
 The case is In re Extended Stay Inc., 09-13764, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
