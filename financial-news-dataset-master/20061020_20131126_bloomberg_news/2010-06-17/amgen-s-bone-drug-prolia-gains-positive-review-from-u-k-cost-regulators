             Amgen Inc. ’s bone-strengthening drug
Prolia should be provided to women at risk of fractures who
can’t take existing drugs, said a U.K. agency that advises the
state-run  National Health Service  on cost-effective treatments.  
 Prolia, which increases bone mass and strength, should be
used to prevent a first fracture from occurring and to ward off
repeated broken bones, the  National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence  said in a statement. The drug is injected
twice a year and costs 183 pounds ($271) per treatment.  
 Older women who can’t take standard osteoporosis pills,
including  Merck & Co. ’s Fosamax and Actonel, sold by  Warner
Chilcott Plc  of Ardee, Ireland, should be eligible to receive
Prolia, the agency said.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc , based in London,
will co-market the drug in Europe with Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen. Analysts  forecast  sales of $2.9 billion
for Prolia, known chemically as denosumab, by 2013.  
 “There was good quality evidence to show that denosumab is
a useful addition to the treatment options available to prevent
a first fracture in women at increased risk and also at
preventing further factures in women who have already
experienced one,” said  Carole Longson , director of the health
technology evaluation center at the agency known as NICE. “We
hope that older women at increased risk of osteoporotic
fractures who cannot take oral bisphosphonates will be
considered for this drug to help prevent the misery of breaking
a bone.”  
 The recommendation is preliminary and the agency is
accepting comments. A final decision is expected later this
year.
