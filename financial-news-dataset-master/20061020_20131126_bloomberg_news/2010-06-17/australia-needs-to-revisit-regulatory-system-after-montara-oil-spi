             Australia must “revisit” its
regulatory system for the offshore petroleum industry after the
Montara oil spill last year off the northwest coast, Resources
Minister Martin Ferguson said.  
 The government expects to receive the findings of an
investigation into the spill tomorrow, he said in a telephone
interview today. Australia has no plans to suspend oil
exploration because of the Montara incident and the BP Plc
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, he said.
