             The German government backs the
publication of stress tests for banks, Finance Ministry
spokesman Michael Offer said.  
 “We see that markets are unsettled and the trust of banks
in each other has deteriorated,” Offer said today in an e-
mailed statement. “Transparency can be helpful as a stabilizing
factor.”
