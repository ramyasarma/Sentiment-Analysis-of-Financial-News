             Easyknit International Holdings Ltd. ,
a Hong Kong-based cotton-garment exporter, said Chief Executive
Officer  Jimmy Kwong  was released on bail after police arrested
him on June 15 in a share-sale investigation.  
 Kwong has denied wrongdoing, according to a statement from
the board of Easyknit Enterprises Holdings Ltd., which he heads.
Easyknit International will seek legal advice on the arrest, it
said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.  
 The police are investigating the alleged sale of 100
million  Sino Union Energy Investment Group Ltd.  shares by
Easyknit unit Planetic International Ltd. The Commercial Crime
Bureau of the Hong Kong Police, acting on a warrant, seized
books and records from Planetic’s offices, Easyknit Enterprises
said in a separate statement.  
 Kwong “repeatedly and clearly” told the police that
Planetic did not sell the Sino Union Energy shares, his company
said. Kwong posted bail of HK$20,000 ($2,568) bail, it said.  
 Easyknit fell 1 percent to HK$3.05 in Hong Kong. The
company owns 32 percent of listed subsidiary  Easyknit
Enterprises , of which Kwong is chief executive officer.  
 The company said it doesn’t expect the removal of the
documents to have an adverse effect on its operations or
finances. Spokespeople were unavailable for comment.  
 Police didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg News
request for comment.
