             Healthscope Ltd.’s management said
they may resign if Healthe Care Managing Director Ben Thynne is
hired in the event of a successful takeover bid by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. Ltd. and CVC Asia Pacific Ltd., the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information or naming the executives. Thynne is helping
KKR identify industry trends and has no intention to take up a
management role, the newspaper cited an unnamed Healthe Care
spokesperson as saying.
