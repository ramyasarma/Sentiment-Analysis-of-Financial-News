             U.S. stocks trimmed losses as
technology and industrial shares turned higher, helping the
market overcome an early slump spurred by a jump in jobless
claims and lower-than-estimated Philadelphia manufacturing.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,113.65 at 1:58 p.m. in New York after tumbling as
much as 0.8 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 15.2 points, or 0.2 percent, paring a drop of as much as 90
points.
