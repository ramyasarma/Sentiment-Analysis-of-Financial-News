             The Boston Red Sox moved up the
start time of their game tonight so fans can see the city’s
basketball team try to capture its 18th championship.  
 The Major League Baseball game at Fenway Park against the
Arizona Diamondbacks was moved up an hour to 6:10 p.m., the Red
Sox said in a news release. At 9 p.m., the Celtics will play at
the Los Angeles Lakers in the 17th Game 7 in National Basketball
Association Finals history.  
 The Celtics have had more success than the Lakers in Game
7s, going 7-0. The Lakers are 3-5, and just 1-5 since moving
from Minneapolis in 1961.  
 “I’ve always thought Game 7 is the ultimate player game,”
Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  said yesterday at a news conference in
Los Angeles. “It’s the game that all the things you’ve worked
on all year, you have to do it and execute it and trust and
play.”  
 In order to keep a perfect record in the decisive game,
Boston will need to overcome the absence of center  Kendrick Perkins , who tore ligaments in his knee in Game 6.  
 The Lakers won 89-67 two days ago to force a deciding game
in the best-of-seven series. They are seven-point favorites to
win the franchise’s 16th title, according to Las Vegas-based
betting news website Pregame.com.  
 The NBA’s two most successful teams last met for the title
two seasons ago, with Boston beating L.A. 131-92 in Game 6 to
take the championship.  
 Overtime History  
 The only NBA Finals Game 7 during the last 15 years was in
2005, when the San Antonio Spurs topped the Detroit Pistons 81-
74 at home.  
 Rasheed Wallace , who will see increased time due to
Perkins’s injury, is the only player on either squad who has
taken part in a Game 7 of the finals, scoring 11 points in the
Pistons’ 2005 defeat.  
 If tonight’s contest goes to overtime, the Celtics have
history on their side. They’ve played in the only two
championship-round deciding games that ended regulation in a
tie, beating the St. Louis Hawks 125-123 in 1957, and besting
the Lakers 110-107 in 1962.  
 The Lakers’  Phil Jackson , who is looking to extend his own
record by winning an 11th title as coach, said players need to
stay focused during the pressure of Game 7.  
 “If you’re not going to be able to do the most basic
things, if you come out of your skin, in other words if you’re
out of character, things are going to happen awry,” Jackson
said yesterday at a news conference. “Even though it’s not just
a game, it’s a different type of a game, but it’s something that
you have to be able to confront and hold your composure in.”
