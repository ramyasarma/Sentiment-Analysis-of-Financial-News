             Lafarge SA , the world’s largest
cement maker, lost a challenge at the European Union’s highest
court to a 249.6 million-euro ($309 million) antitrust fine
levied by EU regulators almost eight years ago for colluding on
plasterboard prices.  
 The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg rejected
Lafarge’s appeal in its entirety and confirmed the penalty.
Today’s ruling conflicts with the view of an adviser to the top
EU court, who said that the case should be re-examined.  
 Lafarge was appealing a fine levied by the European
Commission in November 2002 for its role in a cartel which
covered about 80 percent of the EU plasterboard market.
Lafarge’s fine was upheld by a lower EU court in 2008.  
 The EU plasterboard market was worth about 1.2 billion
euros at the time of the violations. The Brussels-based
commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator, fined four companies
for fixing prices of plasterboard for at least four years until
1998. The regulator said collusion started in 1992 when BPB Ltd.
and Knauf Group’s Gips agreed to end a price war and lessen
competition.  
 The ruling “puts to an end this old case” that dates back
to the late 1990s,  Claire Mathieu , a spokeswoman for Paris-based
Lafarge, said in an e-mailed statement, adding the company had
made provisions for the fine. “Lafarge has gradually put in
place a program that’s in line with antitrust rules.”  
 An EU court in 2008 cut the fine for BPB, a  Cie. de Saint-
Gobain SA  unit, to 118.8 million euros from 138.6 million euros.  
 Jan Mazak , an advocate general at the court, said in
February that a lower court’s analysis of the case did “not
deal adequately” with Lafarge’s arguments concerning
discrimination and the duration of the antitrust breach.  
 The case is C-413/08, Lafarge v Commission.
