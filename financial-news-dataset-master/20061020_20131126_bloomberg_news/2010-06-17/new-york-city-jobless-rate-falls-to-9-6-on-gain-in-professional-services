             New York City’s unemployment rate
fell for the fifth consecutive month, to 9.6 percent in May, on
new jobs in business services, education, health care and
tourism, according to state  Labor Department  reports.  
 The addition of 14,700 jobs brought the rate down from 9.8
percent in April, the lowest in 11 months, the labor department
said today. The U.S. unemployment rate for May dropped 0.2
percentage points to 9.7 percent.  
 “Although it’s still too early to announce an end to the
downturn, the city’s job market has certainly bounced back much
faster than during past recoveries,” department economist  James Brown  said in a statement.  
 Professional and business services added 3,700 jobs, to
569,700, and leisure and hospitality employment increased by
3,800 to 318,200, the department said.  
 Financial companies increased hiring for the third
consecutive month, climbing by 2,000 jobs to 429,000, as layoffs
in the securities industry abated and real-estate jobs
increased.  
 The drop in the unemployment rate is “good news” for the
city, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said in a prepared statement.
“But the more telling development is that our labor force has
grown to its largest point since at least 1976, probably the
largest point ever.”  
 ‘Diverse Sectors’  
 Job gains show employers’ and workers’ confidence in the
city resulting from Bloomberg administration efforts “to grow
diverse sectors of our economy, expand job training and
placement services, and improve New York City’s overall quality
of life,” the mayor said. He is founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  
 Statewide, the seasonally adjusted jobless rate fell to its
lowest rate since April 2009, dropping 0.1 percentage points to
8.3 percent last month.  
 “Like the nation as a whole, the state’s rate of private
sector job growth slowed in May 2010,” said  Peter Neenan , a
state Labor Department statistician. “However,  New York’s 
unemployment rate continued to improve, reaching its lowest
level in over a year.”
