             The Swiss National Bank is likely to
stop selling the franc as long as the European sovereign-debt
crisis doesn’t worsen, Commzerbank analysts said.  
 The central bank failed to repeat previous language about
acting “decisively” to prevent the currency’s appreciation
when it met today, analyst Ulrike Rondorf wrote in an e-mailed
note. “Unless the euro zone crisis becomes exacerbated again,
we think the SNB probably will take no more action on the FX
market,” the note said.
