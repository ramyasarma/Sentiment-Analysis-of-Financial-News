             Sales at South Korea’s major
 department stores  increased in May for a 15th month, showing
domestic demand is so far unaffected by concern about the
strength of the global rebound.  
 Spending  at the three biggest chains climbed 8 percent from
a year earlier, after rising 8.8 percent in April, the Ministry
of Knowledge Economy said in a statement today.  
 South Korea’s economy will expand 5.8 percent this year and
4.7 percent in 2011 as exports surge and domestic demand
strengthens, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said this week. Finance Minister  Yoon Jeung Hyun 
said June 14 that the central bank should balance sustaining
growth and curbing inflationary pressures.  
 Policy makers are shifting toward raising interest rates as
the economy rebounds, even as Europe’s debt crisis threatens to
damp the global recovery. Governor  Kim Choong Soo  said last week
the Bank of Korea will focus more on “price stability” after
leaving interest rates unchanged at a record-low 2 percent for a
16th month.  
 The Finance Ministry said this week it may revise up its
2010 growth forecast of around 5 percent on June 24.  
 Discount-store sales  rose 2.3 percent last month, after
rising 0.3 percent in April, according to today’s report.
