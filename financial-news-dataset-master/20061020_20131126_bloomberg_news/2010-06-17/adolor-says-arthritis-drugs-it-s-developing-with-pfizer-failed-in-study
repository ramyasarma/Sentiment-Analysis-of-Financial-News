             Adolor Corp.  said two drugs being
developed with  Pfizer Inc.  were no more effective than a placebo
at controlling pain from osteoarthritis.  
 A trial with more than 400 patients found neither of the
compounds, ADL5859 and ADL5747, showed a “statistically
significant” improvement over the placebo, or dummy pill, in
reducing pain, Exton, Pennsylvania-based Adolor said today in
statement.  
 Researchers also found that a third medicine, oxycodone CR
-- a generic not made by Adolor-- also was no more effective
than a placebo. The drugs were being tested in patients with
arthritis of the knee. About  46 million  U.S. adults have been
diagnosed with arthritis, and the disease limits activities for
about 19 million of those, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta.  
 “We obviously are disappointed with the results of the
study,”  Eliseo Salinas , Adolor’s chief medical officer, said in
the statement. “The extent of the placebo response was
surprising, but unfortunately not unusual in osteoarthritis
studies.”  
 Adolor’s  shares  fell 13 percent in extended trading after
declining 4 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.50 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.  
 Adolor and New York-based Pfizer, the world’s largest drug
company, will evaluate the study data to determine if additional
testing of their medicines is warranted, Adolor said in its
statement.
