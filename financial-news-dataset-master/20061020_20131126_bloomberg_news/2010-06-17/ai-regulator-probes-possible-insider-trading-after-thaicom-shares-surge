             Thailand’s Securities and Exchange
Commission and stock exchange are probing possible insider
trading in Thaicom Pcl shares after the stock surged.  
 The regulator and exchange is investigating whether anyone
benefited from using confidential information to trade Thaicom
shares, Charuphan Intararoong, a SEC spokeswoman, said by phone
from Bangkok today.  
 The opposition Puea Thai party yesterday filed a complaint
with the SEC, urging the regulator to investigate possible
insider trading.  
 Thaicom shares surged 29 percent on June 14 after Prime
Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva’s aide said the Thai government
planned to buy a stake in the company from Singapore’s Temasek
Holdings Pte.
