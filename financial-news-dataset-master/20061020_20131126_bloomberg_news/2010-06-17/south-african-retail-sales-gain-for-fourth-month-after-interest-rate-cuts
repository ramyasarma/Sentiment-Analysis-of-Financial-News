             South African retail sales rose for
the fourth consecutive month in April after the central bank cut
interest rates the month before to spur consumer spending.  
 Sales  rose an annual 3.2 percent after increasing a revised
2.7 percent in March, Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa 
said on its website today. The  median estimate  of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 2.1 percent. Sales
fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in the month.  
 The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest  rate  by half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent on March 25, the seventh
reduction in 16 months. Consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of the economy, has been slow to rebound from last
year’s recession as job losses mount.  
 “We’re nowhere near the boom, but definitely in a recovery
phase,” said  Chris Hart , an economist at Investment Solutions
in Johannesburg. “We’re still going to see better data in
months ahead.”  
 The statistics office revised the retail sales data from
2008 in today’s publication, which showed the industry returned
to growth in January this year, two months earlier than
previously reported.  
 Unemployment  
 The economy shed 171,000 jobs in the first quarter, pushing
the  unemployment rate  to 25.2 percent, the highest of 62
countries tracked by Bloomberg. That’s undermined consumer
 confidence , with the FNB/BER index dropping 1 point to 14 in the
second quarter, First National Bank said on June 14.  
 The rebound in retail sales may give the Reserve Bank room
to keep its key rate unchanged at its next meeting on July 21-
22. The bank left the rate unchanged on May 13 on concern the
European debt crisis may cause the rand to weaken and  inflation 
to accelerate.  
 The rand has gained 1.2 percent against the dollar this
month after dropping 3.3 percent in May. The currency was
trading at 7.5766 per dollar as of 12:22 p.m. in Johannesburg
from 7.5960 before the data was released.
