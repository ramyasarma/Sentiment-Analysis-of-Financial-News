             Cattle futures fell for the first
time this week as slumping U.S. beef prices signal consumer
demand for the meat is waning, after a jump last month. Hogs
also declined.  
 Wholesale choice beef  slumped to $1.5351 a pound at midday,
down 10 percent from a 22-month high on May 11, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Spot-market  steers  for immediate
delivery to slaughterhouses are down about 1.8 percent in the
past  week . The USDA also may report tomorrow that feedlot
supplies are increasing, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Cash prices have been coming down, and boxed-beef values
have been coming down,” said  Dick Quiter , an account executive
at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago. “It seems like high
prices cured everyone’s appetite, for the time being.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.3 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 88.875 cents a pound at 12:23 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Prices climbed 2.2 percent in the previous
three days. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined
0.5 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.104 a pound.  
 Four months of profit for U.S. feedlots probably resulted
in a 23 percent jump in purchases of young cattle in May from a
year earlier, according to the average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed. The USDA will release a monthly report on feedlot
inventories tomorrow.  
 Hogs Slide  
 Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.625 cent, or
0.8 percent, to 82.5 cents a pound on the CME. Prices rose 3.8
percent in the previous four sessions.  
 High pork prices may be eroding consumer demand for the
meat, said  Doug Harper , an analyst at Richard A. Brock &
Associates in Milwaukee. U.S.  retail-pork  prices surged to
$3.043 a pound in May, the highest level since at least 1970,
the USDA said today.  
 The hog market “has really been in kind of a swoon for
about a month,” Harper said. “You’ve got to believe it’s
mostly lack of domestic retail buying.”  
 Wholesale-pork  prices sank 1.7 percent yesterday to 81.34
cents a pound, the lowest level since April 13, USDA data show.
The price slumped 11 percent since reaching a 21-month high on
May 14.
