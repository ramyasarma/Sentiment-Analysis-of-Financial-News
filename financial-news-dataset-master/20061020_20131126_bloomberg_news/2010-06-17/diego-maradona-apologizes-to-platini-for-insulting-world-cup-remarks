             Argentina coach  Diego Maradona 
apologized to  Michel Platini , the head of European soccer’s
governing body, a day after making insulting remarks about him
at the World Cup.  
 Maradona yesterday responded to reporters’ claims that
Platini said he didn’t think the 1986 World Cup winner was the
right man to lead his nation at the 2010 tournament in South
Africa by telling a press conference that Platini “thinks of
himself as being more than the rest of the world.”  
 After Argentina’s 4-1 win over South Korea in Johannesburg
today, Maradona brandished a letter he said Platini had sent him,
in which the UEFA President and former France midfielder denied
questioning the Argentine’s coaching credentials.  
 “I want to apologize to him through you,” Maradona told
reporters at the Soccer City stadium.  
 Maradona, 49, also said yesterday that three-time World Cup
winner  Pele , should “go back to the museum” after the
Brazilian reportedly said that Maradona had only taken the
Argentina coaching job because he needed money.  
 Maradona took over Argentina’s national team in November
2008 and the squad struggled to extend the country’s record of
reaching every World Cup since 1978, clinching a berth in its
final qualifying match.
