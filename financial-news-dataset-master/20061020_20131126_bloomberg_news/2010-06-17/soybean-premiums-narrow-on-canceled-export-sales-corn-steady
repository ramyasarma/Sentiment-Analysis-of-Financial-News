             Cash  premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans narrowed relative to
Chicago futures after a report showed Japan canceled purchases
from the U.S. Corn premiums were steady.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
June narrowed to 64 cents to 67 cents a bushel above July
futures from 65 cents to 68 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. Japan rescinded purchases of 270,100
metric tons. Corn was 37 cents to 39 cents a bushel above July
futures, unchanged from yesterday.  
 “ I saw the cancellation was from Japan, and the new-crop
sales were to China,” said  Troy Lust , an analyst at FCStone LLC
in West Des Moines, Iowa. “That was a bit of a surprise.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.5 cent to
$9.25 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active
contract has declined 12 percent this year.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.7825 a bushel on the CBOT. Corn is down 8.7
percent this year, partly on forecasts for increased U.S.
production.
