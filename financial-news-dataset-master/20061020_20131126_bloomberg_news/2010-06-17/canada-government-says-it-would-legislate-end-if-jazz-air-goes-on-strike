             Canada’s government would introduce
legislation to end a strike threatened by flight attendents for
regional carrier Jazz Air, said Jay Hill, an official for the
governing Conservative Party.  
 Hill, the party’s leader in the House of Commons, made the
announcement today in the legislature.  
 “The government is prepared to act expeditiously to ensure
that work stoppage would be of the shortest possible duration,”
Hill said in Parliament.
