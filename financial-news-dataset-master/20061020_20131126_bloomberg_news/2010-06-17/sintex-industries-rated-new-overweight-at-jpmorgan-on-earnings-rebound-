             Sintex Industries Ltd. was rated
“overweight” in new coverage by JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts
Princy Singh and Dinesh S. Harchandani, who said earnings may be
“set for a strong rebound” as the company benefits from
infrastructure investments and government social-spending
intiatives.  
 The analysts have a share-price estimate of 435 rupees.
