             Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest lender, will hire dozens of bankers in Russia as it
seeks to become the leading foreign investment bank in two to
three years, local chief  Bob Foresman  said.  
 “We will need to have over 100 people just in the broker-
dealer,” Foresman, Barclay’s country manager, said in an
interview yesterday in St. Petersburg. The former local chairman
for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said he is overseeing “a
very aggressive strategy” in Russia.  
 Barclays of London is stepping up hiring as  the economy  of
the world’s biggest energy exporter rebounds from a record 7.9
percent contraction last year, bolstered by higher oil and
metals prices. Russian companies may sell 1 trillion rubles ($32
billion) of domestic bonds this year, according to Trust
Investment Bank and ING Groep NV. Russian stock sales may total
$20 billion, according to UBS AG.  
 Barclays Capital, the bank’s securities unit, was one of
the four arrangers of Russia’s first sovereign Eurobond since
the government defaulted in 1998. The government sold $5.5
billion of the securities in April, the second-biggest emerging-
market debt offering on record.  
 Barclays rival VTB Group is looking to recruit 250 bankers
as the country’s second-largest lender merges its investment and
corporate units,  Yuri Soloviev , chief executive officer of the
state-run bank’s investment arm, said in an interview.  
 Third-Biggest Underwriter  
 Barclays Capital is expanding into European and emerging-
market equities following its acquisition of the North American
operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Barclays has
rebranded Expobank, a Russian retail bank it acquired in 2008
for $745 million.  
 In Russia, Barclays Capital is the third-biggest
underwriter of debt this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 The U.K. bank aims to be the “top global investment bank
in Russia across all our core products,” said Foresman, who
Barclays  hired in September  from Moscow-based Renaissance
Capital, where he was deputy chairman. “We have every intention
to set up a sales, trading and research team on the equity side
and build our own platform.”  
 Hans-Joerg Rudloff , the chairman of Barclays Capital, said
in an interview in May that the bank recently arranged financing
for TNK-BP International Ltd., BP Plc’s oil venture with a group
of Russian billionaires, along with OAO Lukoil, Russia’s largest
non-state oil company, VTB Bank, the country’s second-biggest
lender, and Russian Railways.  
 “We are one of the biggest foreign lenders in the
country,” Rudloff said. “We just completed many capital market
transactions.”
