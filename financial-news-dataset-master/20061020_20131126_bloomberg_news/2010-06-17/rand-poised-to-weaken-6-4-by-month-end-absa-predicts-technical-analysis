             The rand is poised to weaken as much
as 6.4 percent by the end of this month as concern Europe’s debt
crisis will spread fuels risk aversion and encourages investors
to sell higher-yielding assets, according to  Absa Group Ltd.   
 South Africa’s currency is likely to decline to between
7.90 and 8.10 per dollar by month-end as risk aversion pushes
the currency toward its weakest levels reached in the past
month, said  Judy Padayachee , a Johannesburg-based technical
analyst at Absa, the nation’s largest retail bank and a unit of
Barclays Plc. The rand gained 0.2 percent to 7.5829 yesterday.  
 The rand has depreciated 5.1 percent from a 20-month high
on April 7 as concern that Europe’s debt crisis will derail the
global recovery prompted investors to dump higher-yielding
assets. About $6 trillion has been erased from the value of
global equities since its 2010 peak two months ago.  
 “We have some risk aversion in the market right now and
that will put the rand under pressure to weaken,” said
Padayachee. “It’s been in an up-down, up-down consolidation
pattern but with the risk aversion around it’s likely to move to
the weaker levels within its range.”  
 The rand, which fell to a six-month low of 8.08 per dollar
in May, has recovered some losses after European Union
governments approved a $1 trillion bailout for the most indebted
countries and to backstop the euro. Moody’s Investors Service
cut Greece’s credit rating four steps to junk on June 14, citing
“substantial” risks to economic growth from austerity measures
to meet budget deficit targets.
