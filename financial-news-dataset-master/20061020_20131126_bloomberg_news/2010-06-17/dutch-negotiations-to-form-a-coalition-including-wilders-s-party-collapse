             Coalition talks to form a new
government in the Netherlands that would include the Liberals,
the largest party, the Christian Democrats and the anti-
immigration Freedom Party of  Geert Wilders  have collapsed.  
 “The investigation of this option has come to an end,”
Uri Rosenthal, the Liberals’ leader in the upper house of
parliament, said today at a press conference in The Hague. The
Christian Democrats, the party of outgoing Prime Minister  Jan Peter Balkenende , declined to start talks with the two other
parties, Rosenthal said.  
 The  Liberals , led by  Mark Rutte , won 31 seats in the June 9
election after pledging to balance the budget, and the Freedom
Party more than doubled its representation in the lower house to
24 lawmakers. A coalition between the Liberals, the Freedom
Party and the Christian Democrats would have 76 seats in the
150-seat lower house, the smallest possible majority.  
 It’s taken an average of almost three months to form a
coalition in the Netherlands since World War II. Rosenthal
declined to say which other coalition option he would start
investigating. “It is of great importance that we have a
cabinet as soon as possible,” said Rosenthal, who was named
June 12 by  Queen Beatrix  to explore possibilities for forming a
government.
