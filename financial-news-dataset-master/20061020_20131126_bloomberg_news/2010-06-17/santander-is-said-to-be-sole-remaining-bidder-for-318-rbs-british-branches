             Banco Santander SA , Spain’s biggest
bank, is the sole remaining bidder for the 318 British bank
branches being sold by  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc , according to
a person briefed on the situation.  
 The Spanish lender submitted the bid this week, according
to the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter
is private. National Australia Bank Ltd. and Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Spain’s second-largest bank, have dropped
out of the bidding.  
 The branches would “fit like a glove” for Santander,
according to  Matias Inciarte , a vice-chairman at the bank
lender. It would mesh very well with  Santander ’s U.K. strategy
of boosting its business with companies, Inciarte said today in
Santander, Spain, adding it was “public” that the bank had
made an offer for the assets.  
 RBS is selling the outlets to comply with a  European Union 
ruling after it received more than 45.5 billion pounds ($66
billion) in government aid during the credit crunch.  
 Santander, which has boosted its presence in the U.K. with
acquisitions since acquiring Abbey National in 2004, expects its
business in the country to contribute about 17 percent of group
profit this year, Chairman  Emilio Botin  told shareholders on
June 11.
