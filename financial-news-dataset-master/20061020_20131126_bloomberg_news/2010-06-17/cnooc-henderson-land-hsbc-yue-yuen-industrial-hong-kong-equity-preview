 Ajisen China Holdings Ltd.  (538 HK): The operator of
Japanese-style ramen restaurants plans to buy pig farms in China
to curb rising costs and ensure a stable supply of key
ingredients, the South China Morning Post said, citing Chief
Executive  Daisy Poon Wai . Ajisen wants to buy the farms as

profit margin, Poon was cited as saying. The stock rose 0.5
percent to HK$8.28.

 Henderson Land Development Co.  (12 HK): The builder
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Lee Shau-kee  said it will
take a charge of HK$734 million ($94 million) against earnings
after sales of 20 luxury flats were canceled -- including one it
had claimed as a world record.  
 The company was cut to “neutral” from “outperform” by
Credit Suisse Group AG analysts  Cusson Leung  and  Joyce Kwock ,
who said the home sales cancellations may have hurt investor
confidence. The stock rose 0.4 percent to HK$47.80.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc  (5 HK): Europe’s largest bank plans to
