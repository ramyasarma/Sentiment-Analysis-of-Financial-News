             U.K. public-sector workers are
better paid, have more valuable pensions, work fewer hours and
retire earlier than their counterparts in private industry, a
research group said.  
 London-based  Policy Exchange , which supports the wider use
of market forces in public services, found the median salary of
state employees is 12 percent higher than that in the private
sector and “generous” pensions add 15 percent to their pay.  
 “People used to say that public-sector workers had great
pensions to make up for their low salaries,”  Andrew Lilico , Policy Exchange’s chief economist, said in an e-mail.
“That’s now out of date as public-sector workers have much
better pay as well as better pensions and conditions.”  
 Britain spends 160 billion pounds ($237 billion) a year on
state wages and the new coalition government says cuts are
needed to help rein in the record budget deficit.  
 Prime Minister  David Cameron  has published the salaries of
highly paid civil servants, contrasting their remuneration with
the wage restraint forced on workers in private industry during
the recession. On June 14, Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said
“gold-plated” state pensions are neither fair nor affordable.  
 Over a lifetime, those in the private sector work 23
percent more hours, equivalent to 9.2 years of a public-sector
employee’s working life, the Policy Exchange report said.  
 “Most countries getting their debts under control are
using a mix of wage freezes, cuts and also addressing pensions
liabilities -- which in almost all cases has been met with
fierce trade union opposition,” Lilico said. “It’s likely the
same will be the case here -- though the reality is that phasing
out national pay bargaining, and replacing it with local wage
bargaining, would be fundamentally more efficient.”
