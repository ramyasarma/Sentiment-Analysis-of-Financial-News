             Israel’s benchmark index may
increase 4.8 percent if the measure closes above the 200-day
moving average, Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. said.  
 “It might close over it with a little global support and
make its way for a target level of 1,160,” said Tel Aviv-based
Daniel Rapoport, head of trading Excellence.  
 The 200-day resistance level for  the TA-25 Index of the 25
biggest companies  is at 1,109.30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The measure gained 0.7 percent to 1,106.27 as of 3:06
p.m. in Tel Aviv. It has fallen 11 percent from the record close
on April 6.  
 European stocks rose for a seventh day, the longest stretch
of gains since September, after Spain sold $4.3 billion of bonds
and BP Plc surged. U.S. futures advanced while Asian shares were
little changed.  
 Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.
