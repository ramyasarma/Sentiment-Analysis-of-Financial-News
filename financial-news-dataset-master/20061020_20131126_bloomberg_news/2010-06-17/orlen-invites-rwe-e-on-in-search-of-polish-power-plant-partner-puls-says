             PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil 
refiner, plans to invite partners next week to help it build a 
gas-fired power plant, Puls Biznesu reported, without saying 
where it got the information. Orlen will send invitations to 
energy companies, including RWE AG, GDF Suez SA, Verbundnetz 
Gas AG, and E.ON AG, as well as to financial investors, such as
Bain Capital, Bridgepoint, Qatar Investment Authority, and 
Kulczyk Investments, the newspaper said.  
 The oil refiner aims to complete the 420 megawatt to 490 
megawatt unit as early as in 2014, Puls said, adding that Orlen
estimates the cost of building one megawatt at about 1.3 
million euros ($1.6 million).
