             Swiss stocks declined, ending a six-
day advance, as reports showed U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly
increased last week and Philadelphia manufacturing missed
economists’ forecasts.  
 Syngenta AG  dropped 1.7 percent and  Novartis AG  declined
1.3 percent.  St. Galler Kantonalbank  fell for the first time
this week after being downgraded at Kepler Capital Markets.  UBS
AG , Switzerland’s largest bank, gained 1.4 percent as Swiss
lawmakers approved a tax treaty with the U.S., ending a legal
tussle that threatened the bank’s American business.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  slipped 14.82, or 0.2
percent, to 6,475.25. The gauge has declined 7.1 percent from
this year’s high on April 15 amid speculation that Europe’s debt
crisis may derail the economic recovery. The broader  Swiss
Performance Index  retreated 0.2 percent to 5,689.03 today.  
 “The weaker-than-expected jobs data show that the U.S.
economy is still failing to create jobs at a pace that will
tackle the high level of unemployment,”  David Semmens , an
economist with Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said in an
e-mail. “This will ultimately keep the consumer on the back
foot and growth will disappoint in the second half of 2010.”  
 Initial jobless claims increased by 12,000 to 472,000 in
the week ended June 12, U.S. Labor Department figures showed
today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 450,000
claims, according to the median forecast. The number of people
receiving unemployment insurance rose, while those getting
extended benefits dropped.  
 U.S. Economy  
 Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index slumped to 8 in June from 21.4 the
previous month. Readings above zero signal growth. Economists
forecast the index would fall to 20, according to the median of
58 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The Swiss National Bank left its benchmark interest rate
close to zero today and softened its stance on fighting franc
gains as deflation risks ease. The central bank held the three-
month Libor target rate at 0.25 percent at its quarterly meeting
in Geneva. The decision was forecast by all 21 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Shares of chemical maker Syngenta retreated 1.7 percent to
263.2 Swiss francs, the biggest loss in the SMI  
 Novartis declined 1.3 percent to 54.4 francs. Cheuvreux
reiterated an “underperform” recommendation on the
pharmaceutical company today.  
 Actelion, ABB  
 Actelion Ltd. , Switzerland’s largest biotechnology company,
retreated 1.2 percent to 42.36 francs.  ABB Ltd. , the world’s
biggest builder of power-transmission networks, slipped 0.5
percent to 20.73 francs.  Adecco SA , the biggest supplier of
temporary workers, declined 0.5 percent to 55.85 francs.  
 UBS increased 1.4 percent to 15.72 francs. The treaty
approval means the bank can complete the handover of client data
of suspected tax dodgers by August, allowing UBS to close a
chapter that the Justice Minister had called an “existential
threat.”  
 St. Galler Kantonalbank lost 1.1 percent to 482 francs.
Kepler cut its recommendation to “hold” from “buy,” citing
“sluggish earnings growth.”
