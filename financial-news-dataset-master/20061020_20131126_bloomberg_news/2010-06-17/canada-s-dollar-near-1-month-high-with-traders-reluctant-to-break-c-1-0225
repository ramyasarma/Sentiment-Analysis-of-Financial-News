             Canada’s dollar weakened versus its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days as raw
materials such as crude oil and copper declined and as a report
showed wholesale sales unexpectedly fell in April.  
 The currency declined against all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts as it failed three times in four days to appreciate
beyond C$1.0225, forming a so-called triple top pattern. Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said yesterday the uneven global
recovery and prospects of renewed weakness in Europe mean future
increases in its target interest rate aren’t “preordained.”  
 “You’re seeing the Canadian dollar soften a little bit
today with commodities, oil in particular, slightly lower,”
 Blake Jespersen,  director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. “Overall we’re in
consolidation mode for the next few days.”  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, weakened 0.3
percent to C$1.0277 per U.S. dollar at 4:29 p.m. in Toronto,
compared with C$1.0243 yesterday. It has strengthened to
C$1.0225 three times in the last four days, the highest level
since May 14. One Canadian dollar buys 97.31 U.S. cents.  
 Canadian government bonds rose, sending the yield on the
10-year note 7 basis points lower to 3.30 percent. The 3.5
percent security due in June 2020 rose 56 cents to C$101.68. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Canada’s currency reached parity with the greenback on
April 6 for the first time in almost two years as signs of an
accelerating recovery in the global economy boosted equity
markets and demand for the nation’s raw materials, including
copper, gold and crude oil.  
 Wholesale Sales  
 The loonie has weakened 2.5 percent since then as the
European sovereign-debt crisis throws doubt on the recovery.
Even so, the currency remains the second-best performer this
year among the greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  
 Wholesale sales unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent to C$44
billion ($43 billion) in April, led by lower sales of motor
vehicles, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
expected a 0.3 percent increase, based on the median of 13
responses in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Carney raised the central bank’s benchmark interest rate on
June 1 to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25 percent. Policy
makers next meet on July 20 to set rates.  
 “Arguably Carney left no clear direction yesterday,”
 Firas Askari , head currency trader in Toronto at Bank of
Montreal, Canada’s fourth-largest lender, said in an e-mail.
“The Canadian dollar is weaker against the crosses as there
appears to be big U.S. dollar bids around the C$1.0210 to
C$1.0220 area.”  
 Yield Spread  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent after
falling as much as 0.8 percent. Crude for July delivery dropped
as much as 1.9 percent to $76.17 a barrel in New York, and
copper for September delivery slid 3 percent to $2.924 a pound
on the Comex in New York, the biggest loss for a most-active
contract since June 4. Canada’s currency tends to rise and fall
with stocks and commodity prices.  
 The yield advantage of 10-year U.S. Treasuries over
similar-maturity Canadian government debt was little changed at
11 basis points. The gap was 18 basis points on June 9.
