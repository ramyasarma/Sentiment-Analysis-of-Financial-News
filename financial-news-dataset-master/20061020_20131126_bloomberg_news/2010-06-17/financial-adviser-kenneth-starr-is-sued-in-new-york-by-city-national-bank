             Kenneth Starr , the investment
adviser accused in a criminal indictment of stealing at least
$59 million from clients, was sued by  City National Bank ,
according to state court records in New York.  
 City National’s court filing yesterday refers to an
agreement with Starr over a “term promissory note” dated
Feb. 25 and says he is required to answer the bank’s summons. A
complaint with City National’s allegations wasn’t yet available.  
 Starr, 66, of Manhattan, was charged in May in a federal
grand jury indictment in New York with 20 counts of wire fraud
and one count each of securities fraud, money laundering and
fraud by an investment adviser. The alleged victims of the fraud
include an actress, a former executive of a talent agency, the
stepson of a deceased heir to a business fortune, a 99-year-old
heiress, and a film producer.  
 Starr’s clients have included actors  Sylvester Stallone  and
 Wesley Snipes  and heiress Rachel “Bunny” Mellon.  
 Sabrina Shroff, a public defender who represents Starr in
the criminal case, and  Abbe Lowell , a lawyer for Starr in a
civil suit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment
after regular business hours yesterday.  
 Cary Walker , a spokesman for Los Angeles-based City
National, declined to comment.  
 The case is City National Bank v. Kenneth I. Starr, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York.
