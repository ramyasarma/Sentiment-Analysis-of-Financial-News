             National Australia Bank Ltd. may
sell an adviser network to IOOF Holdings Ltd. in addition to Axa
Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd.’s North platform to help win
regulatory approval for its takeover plan, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column, without
saying where it got the information. The competition regulator
has said any buyer of the North platform must have a strong
distribution network, the newspaper said.
