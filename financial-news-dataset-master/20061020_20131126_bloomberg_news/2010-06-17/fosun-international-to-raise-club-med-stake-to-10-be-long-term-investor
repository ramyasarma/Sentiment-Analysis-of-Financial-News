             Fosun International Ltd. , the
Chinese company that acquired a 7.1 percent stake in French
resorts operator  Club Mediterranee SA , said it aims to raise its
holding to 10 percent.  
 The Shanghai-based company wants to be a long-term investor
in Club Med, Fosun International said in a statement distributed
before a briefing in the Chinese city today. Fosun International
didn’t give a time period for increasing its stake in  Club Med 
and said it doesn’t plan to raise its stake to more than 10
percent for 24 months after boosting its holdings.  
 The acquisition of a stake in Club Med is part of Fosun
International’s plans to work with the Paris-based resort
operator on opening attractions in China. Club Med aims to
increase the number of Chinese customers to 200,000 by 2015 from
23,000 last year, making the country its second-largest market.
Fosun and Club Med had plans to open five resorts by 2015.  
 “Fosun wants to be one of Club Med’s largest shareholders
within the next two years as we’re quite optimistic on China’s
tourism industry and growth of domestic demand,”  Liang Xinjun ,
the Chinese company’s chief executive officer, said at the
briefing today. The price of Fosun’s Club Med stake was below
the current  stock price , Liang said, without giving a figure.  
 Club Med’s  shares  gained 9.1 percent to 13.75 euros on June
14 in Paris trading after announcing its agreement with Fosun
International. The Chinese company’s stock rose 4.1 percent to
HK$5.36 in Hong Kong trading after the announcement.  
 Revenue from Fosun International’s steel business, which
accounted for more than 70 percent of the company’s sales last
year, fell to 24.6 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in 2009 from 30.9
billion yuan in 2008, according to its annual report. Overall
revenue declined 13 percent to 34.9 billion yuan last year.
