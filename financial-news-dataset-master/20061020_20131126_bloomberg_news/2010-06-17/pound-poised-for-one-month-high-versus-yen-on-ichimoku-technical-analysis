             The pound may extend gains versus
Japan’s currency to reach a one-month high of 137 yen, Ueda
Harlow Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 An ichimoku chart for the British currency shows bullish
signals including a short-term conversion line crossing a
longer-term baseline, said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior analyst at
the online currency-trading company in Tokyo.  
 “In the short term, the pound is gaining technically
driven momentum to head higher,” Yamauchi said in an interview.  
 The pound traded at 134.56 yen as of 7:54 a.m. in Tokyo,
having risen from its 2010 low of 126.77 touched on May 20. The
currency’s conversion line stood at 133.20 yen, above the
baseline of 131.60.  
 An ichimoku chart is used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
The conversion line plots the sum of the highest high and lowest
low over the previous nine trading days. The baseline is the
same calculation over the past 26 days.  
 “The key is whether the pound can rise above this month’s
high of near 136.40 yen, with a successful break through this
level opening the way for the British currency to reach the
bottom-line of the ichimoku cloud near 137 yen,” Yamauchi said.
The pound hasn’t traded above 137 yen since May 14.  
 The pound may struggle to extend its advance above the
neckline of the mid-139 yen level, with “economic fundamentals
continuing to support a decline in the currency from a long-term
viewpoint,” he said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
