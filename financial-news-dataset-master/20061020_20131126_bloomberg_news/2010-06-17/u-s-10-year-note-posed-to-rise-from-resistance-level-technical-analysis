             The yield on the Treasury 10-year
note may push higher when the benchmark security breaks out of
its current trading range, according to CRT Capital Group LLC.  
 Ten-year notes have traded between 3.13 percent and 3.42
percent since the start of the month, to average 3.26 percent.
Resistance lies at 3.19 percent, while support is at 3.31
percent, said  David Ader , head of government bond strategy in
Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT.  
 “We are getting ready for some bigger moves outside this
pivotal midpoint of the activity, so the question is, ‘what way
are we going to break?’” said Ader. “The initial moves may be
to somewhat higher yields.”  
 Resistance currently lies at 3.19 percent, while support is
at 3.31 percent, he said. Resistance is an area on a chart where
orders may be clustered. A breach of one level often implies an
extension of the move to the next level.  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note hit a 2010 high of 4.01
percent on April 5 and a low of 3.06 percent on May 25, the
least in more than a year. The average yield since April 6 has
been 3.5 percent, according to Bloomberg data. It rose 2 basis
points to 3.28 percent at 7:36 a.m. in New York.  
 “Markets don’t trade sideways in a tightening range for a
long time,” Ader said. “The trend lines are converging. They
are not universally bearish or bullish. If the lines converge,
they will at about 3.25 percent.”  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
