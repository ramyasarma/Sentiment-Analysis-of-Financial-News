             Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, the
biggest telecommunications company in Portugal, said that the
synergies announced by Telefonica SA in relation to its bid for
a stake in a Brazilian wireless venture “lack ambition.”  
 The Lisbon-based company reiterated that the offer does not
reflect the strategic value of the asset for Telefonica of
Spain, according to a presentation posted on the website of
Portugal’s securities regulator.  
 Portugal Telecom is asking investors to vote June 30 on an
increased 6.5 billion-euro bid from Telefonica for its stake in
the venture that controls Vivo Participacoes SA. If shareholders
opt to vote against the offer, Portugal Telecom can continue to
“create value” by leveraging on exposure to Brazil and Vivo in
the future, according to the Portuguese company’s presentation.
