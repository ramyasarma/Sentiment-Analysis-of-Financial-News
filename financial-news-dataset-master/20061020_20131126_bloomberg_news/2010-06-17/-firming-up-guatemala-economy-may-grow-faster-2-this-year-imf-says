             Guatemala’s economy may grow more
than 2 percent this year as the government curtails stimulus
spending to reduce debt, the International Monetary Fund said.  
 “Guatemala’s economic recovery is firming up,” the IMF
said in an e-mailed statement today after its third review of
the Central American nation’s adherence to an $927 million
emergency credit program approved during last year’s crisis.
“Growth is expected to exceed 2 percent in 2010, which is
significantly higher than envisaged in the previous review.”  
 While Guatemala may need to increase spending to repair
damaged crops and roads caused by tropical storm Agatha last
month, the government remains “firmly committed” to fiscal
restraint, the IMF said.
