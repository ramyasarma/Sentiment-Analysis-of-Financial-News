             Kroger Co. , the largest U.S.
grocery-store chain, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded
analysts’ projections, sending the shares up the most in 15
months.  
 Net income declined 14 percent to $373.7 million, or 58
cents a share, the Cincinnati-based company said today in a
statement. That compared with the 54-cent average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Merchandise costs climbed 11 percent.  
 Kroger struck a better balance in offering discounts to
increase traffic, according to  Scott Mushkin , an analyst at New
York-based Jefferies & Co. Kroger has faced escalating
competition from  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , which has slashed prices
on grocery items like meats and dairy.  
 “The environment with Wal-Mart and other stores has gotten
very competitive,” Mushkin said in an interview. “Kroger
curtailed some of their self-inflicted wounds by pulling back
couponing, but not all of it.”  
 Kroger  rose 89 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $20.97 at 10:04
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . Earlier they
rose as high as $21.44, the biggest gain since March 2009.  
 Revenue  advanced 8.7 percent to $24.8 billion in the period
ended May 22, helped by fuel sales. Profit was $435.1 million,
or 66 cents, in the year-earlier quarter.  
 (Kroger began a conference call at 10 a.m. New York time to
