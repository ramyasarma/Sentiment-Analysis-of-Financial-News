             The Qatar Investment Authority, one 
of the world’s best endowed sovereign wealth funds, is in talks
to buy a one-third stake in London’s Savoy Hotel and is among 
the final bidders in an auction for the Grosvenor House Hotel, 
the London-based Times reported, without saying where it got 
the information.  
 The Savoy, currently being restored, is jointly owned by 
Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s HBOS unit and Saudi Arabia’s Prince 
Alwaleed bin Talal; none of the parties would comment on the 
talks, the newspaper said.  
 The Grosvenor House is being sold by Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and there are as many as five other bidders, 
including an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund and the Government
of Singapore Investment Corporation, the Times said.
