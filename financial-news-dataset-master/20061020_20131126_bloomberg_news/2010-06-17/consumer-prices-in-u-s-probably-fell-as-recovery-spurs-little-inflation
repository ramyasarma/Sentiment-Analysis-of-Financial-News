             The  cost  of living in the U.S.
probably dropped in May for a second month and a gauge of the
outlook for growth climbed, pointing to an expansion with little
inflation, economists said before reports today.  
 The consumer price index fell 0.2 percent after a 0.1
percent decline in April, according to the median forecast of 79
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The Conference Board’s
leading economic indicators, a measure of the outlook for the
next three to six months, rose 0.4 percent in May, the 13th gain
in the past 14 months, the survey showed.  
 Retailers including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  are using price
cuts to bolster sales as customers face almost 10 percent
unemployment and foreclosures mount. The lack of inflation gives
Federal Reserve policy makers scope to leave the benchmark
interest rate near zero in coming months and help invigorate the
economy.  
 “The economy has a great deal of slack, as we would expect
coming out of a very difficult and long recession,” said  Robert Dye , a senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in
Pittsburgh. “It is very difficult for inflation to grab a
foothold.”  
 Other reports today may show fewer Americans applied for
jobless benefits last week and manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region expanded this month.  
 The Labor Department’s consumer-price report is due at 8:30
a.m. in Washington. Survey forecasts ranged from a decrease of
0.4 percent to a 0.1 percent gain. Last month’s projected drop
would be the biggest since December 2008.  
 Year-Over-Year  
 Prices in the 12 months ended May probably climbed 2
percent, the smallest gain since November and down from a 2.2
percent year-over-year rise the prior month, according to the
survey median.  
 Excluding food and energy costs, the so-called  core index 
rose 0.1 percent, the survey showed, after no change in April.
The projected 0.9 percent increase over the past 12 months would
match the previous month’s gain as the lowest since January
1966.  
 The Fed’s long-term forecast for its preferred measure of
inflation, the Commerce Department’s index tied to consumer
spending and excluding food and fuel, calls for gains in a range
of 1.7 percent to 2 percent. That gauge, which is typically
lower than the CPI, was up 1.2 percent in the 12 months through
April.  
 Some lower-income customers in the U.S. are “still deeply
in the recession” and are shopping various retailers for the
cheapest prices, Jamie Sohosky, senior director of marketing for
Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores, said this month.  
 More Coupons  
 Shoppers at Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, are
also using more coupons than a year ago, Sohosky said. They’re
worried about losing their jobs and paying mortgages, she said.  
 Also at 8:30 a.m., another report from the Labor Department
will show  initial claims  for unemployment insurance benefits
dropped to 450,000 last week, the fewest in a month, from
456,000 the prior week, according to the survey median.  
 Manufacturing is at the forefront of the recovery, another
report is forecast to show. Factories in the region covering
eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware expanded
for a 10th straight month in June, data due at 10 a.m. from the
Philadelphia Fed may show.  
 The bank’s  manufacturing index  slowed to 20 this month from
21.4 in May, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed. Readings greater than zero signal growth.  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Machinery Index  is up
11 percent so far this year. The broader S&P 500 Index is little
changed on concern the European debt crisis will slow global
growth.  
 The 10 a.m. report from the Conference Board, a New York
research group, is expected to show the expansion will continue
through the third quarter. The index of leading economic
indicators is forecast to rise after falling 0.1 percent in
April.
