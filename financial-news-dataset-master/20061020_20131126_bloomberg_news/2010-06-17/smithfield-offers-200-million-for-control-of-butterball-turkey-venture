             Smithfield Foods Inc.  offered about
$200 million for control of Butterball LLC, the largest U.S.
turkey producer, by buying out its joint venture partner.  
 Under the terms of an operating agreement, the partner may
either accept the offer or purchase Smithfield’s 49 percent
stake in Butterball, Smithfield said today in a statement.  
 The accord would require Smithfield to retire about $215
million of  Butterball ’s debt. A decision will be made by
September, Smithfield said.  
 Buying out the partner, who Smithfield didn’t identify,
would allow Smithfield to “build the Butterball brand” without
being limited by both sides’ investment accord and their
disagreements, Chief Executive Officer C.  Larry Pope  said in the
statement.  
 Smithfield, the world’s largest pork processor, reported a
fourth-quarter profit of 18 cents a share adjusted for charges.
The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a
profit of 16 cents a share.  
 The Smithfield, Virginia-based company said Butterball’s
results in the quarter were helped lower live-turkey prices.
