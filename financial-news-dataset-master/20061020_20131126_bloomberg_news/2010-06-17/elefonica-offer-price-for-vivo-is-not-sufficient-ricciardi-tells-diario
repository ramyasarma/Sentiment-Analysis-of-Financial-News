             Telefonica SA’s offer price for a 
stake in the venture that controls Brazilian wireless operator 
Vivo Participacoes SA is not sufficient, Jose Maria Espirito 
Santo Ricciardi, chief executive officer of Banco Espirito 
Santo SA’s investment banking unit, told Diario Economico.  
 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, Portugal’s biggest 
telecommunications company, is asking investors to vote June 30
on an increased 6.5 billion-euro bid from Telefonica for
its stake in the venture that controls Vivo. Banco Espirito 
Santo is a shareholder in Portugal Telecom.   
 Ricciardi said he hopes that Portugal Telecom does not 
sell the stake, according to the Portuguese newspaper.
