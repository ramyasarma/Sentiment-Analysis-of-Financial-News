             Sri Lanka’s government said it plans
to take over the local unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe’s
largest oil company, with the purchase of a 51 percent stake
that it doesn’t already own.  
 The government has formed a committee made up of officials
from four ministries, including power and petroleum, that will
negotiate with Shell, Cabinet spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella
told reporters in Colombo today. The state currently owns a 49
percent stake in Shell Gas Lanka Ltd., the island’s largest
retailer of liquefied petroleum gas.  
 “The government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa promised to
stop privatizations and we will use every opportunity to buy
back sold assets,” Rambukwella said.  
 The Sri Lankan government has agreed to buy Emirates
Airline’s 43.6 percent stake in SriLankan Airlines, the nation’s
largest carrier, for an undisclosed price, Chairman Nishanta
Wickremasinghe said on June 4. The state already owns 51 percent
of the airline.  
 Shell said it’s examining possible sales of LPG interests
in countries including Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the
Philippines and Singapore.
