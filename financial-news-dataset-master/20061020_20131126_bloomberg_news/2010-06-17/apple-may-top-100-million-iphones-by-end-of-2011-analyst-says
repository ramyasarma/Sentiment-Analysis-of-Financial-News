             Apple Inc. ’s customer base for the
iPhone may top 100 million users next year, with demand for the
soon-to-be-released iPhone 4 helping to persuade more buyers to
embrace the smartphone, Morgan Stanley said.  
 “We see the iPhone installed base rising from
approximately 30 million subscribers at the end of 2009 to over
100 million by the end of 2011,” analyst  Katy Huberty  said in a
report yesterday. “Upgrades will emerge as a key demand driver
in the coming years.”  
 Apple said yesterday that it received more than 600,000
preorders for the iPhone 4, a faster, thinner model that will be
released in the U.S. and four other countries on June 24. The
early orders set a single-day record, exceeding the company’s
expectations. AT&T Inc., the exclusive provider of iPhone
service in the U.S., said it sold out all the devices it had
allocated for preorders.  
 Apple Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  added features,
such as video calling and a sharper screen, to ward off
competition from rival phones using Google Inc.’s Android
software. The iPhone, which debuted in 2007, has become Apple’s
top-selling product, accounting for  40 percent  of revenue last
quarter.  
 Demand for the iPhone 4 may also be driven by the fact that
57 percent of iPhone users in the U.S. own an older model that
won’t run Apple’s new iOS 4 software, according to Huberty, who
is based in New York. That software adds support for new
features such as multitasking, the ability to run multiple
programs at the same time.  
 New, lower-priced service plans from AT&T may also help
lure buyers, said Huberty, who  rates  Apple stock “overweight”
and doesn’t own the shares.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, rose $4.62 to
$271.87 at 4 p.m. New York time in  trading . The shares have
advanced 29 percent this year.
