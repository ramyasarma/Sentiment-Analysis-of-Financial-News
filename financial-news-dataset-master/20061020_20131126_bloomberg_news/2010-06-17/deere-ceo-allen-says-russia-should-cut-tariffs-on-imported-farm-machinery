             Deere & Co. , the world’s largest
farm equipment maker, plans to expand in Russia and said the
government should lower tariffs on imported machinery.  
 The company is boosting its presence in the country, the
world’s third-largest  wheat  exporter, because it has 9 percent
of the world’s arable land and 20 percent of its forests, Chief
Executive Officer  Sam Allen  said at the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum today. The government shouldn’t
favor short-term tariffs that give preference to local
producers, or push the use of domestic suppliers, he said.  
 “We’re willing to gamble on the economic environment,”
Allen said. “The amount of localization should be driven by
market forces, not percentages, and we are committed to finding
local suppliers.”  
 Deere said in April it opened a factory in Domodedovo,
south of Moscow, to manufacture agricultural, construction and
forestry equipment and distribute components. The plant is the
Moline, Illinois-based company’s largest investment in Russia.  
 Deere  rose 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $59.42 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
risen 9.9 percent this year.
