             China will strengthen scrutiny of
hot money inflows into the nation to prevent the formation of
asset bubbles, Wang Xiaoyi, deputy director of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange, wrote in an article
published in the latest edition of China Forex Magazine.  
 The nation’s economic growth is still mainly supported by
government policy, Wang wrote. Realizing stable and growing
foreign demand for Chinese products may become more difficult,
Wang wrote.
