             Emergency-room visits from abuse of
prescription and over-the-counter medicines doubled in the U.S.
in four years, matching for the first time the number of
overdoses of illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  
 Regulator-approved treatments were implicated in a record 1
million patients who sought help at hospital emergency
departments in 2008, twice the number as in 2004, according to a
 study released today  by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, in Atlanta. Overdoses from illicit drugs were
unchanged, at 1 million emergency visits.  
 The most hospitalizations were caused by painkillers, with
visits more than doubling, and tranquilizers, with an 89 percent
increase.  King Pharmaceuticals Inc. , in Bristol Tennessee, and
Purdue Pharma LP, in Stamford, Connecticut, won approval in the
last year for drugs to prevent misuse. A half-dozen drugmakers
are developing pain pills that resist abuse methods such as
crushing, dissolving in alcohol, and taking more than needed.  
 “Additional measures are needed urgently,” researchers
wrote in the CDC’s Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report. “Recent
public health and law enforcement measures intended to prevent
nonmedical use of such drugs have not prevented rate
increases.”  
 The biggest increase in emergency visits was from adults in
their 20s, according to the study. The researchers analyzed
reports from 220 emergency departments across the U.S. to
estimate the nation’s tally.
