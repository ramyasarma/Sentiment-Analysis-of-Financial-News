             Gold climbed in New York on concern
that Europe’s financial crisis will be prolonged, spurring
demand for the precious metal to protect wealth.  
 Spain’s central bank said yesterday it planned to publish
the results of stress tests to counter speculation it needs
international aid. European Union leaders meet today in Brussels
to discuss the region’s economies and the so-called stability
and growth pact. Gold futures are trading within 1.3 percent of
a record $1,254.50 an ounce set last week.  
 “The metal continues to be seen as a safe haven by
investors,” said  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com
in London. Prices should “remain supported by investment dip
buying and could trade to a fresh record high should broader
risk appetite decline again.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August added $7.70, or 0.6
percent, to $1,238.20 an ounce at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.6 percent
higher at $1,236.93.  
 The metal was unchanged at $1,234.50 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 European policy makers agreed in May on an unprecedented
loan package for Greece on concern the nation’s fiscal crisis
may spread across the 16-nation euro region. Bullion rose 13
percent this year, heading for a 10th straight annual increase,
the longest run since at least 1920, while the euro has dropped
14 percent against the dollar.  
 ‘Bought Time’  
 World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said yesterday there
are “challenges” ahead in Europe even if the rescue packages
put together by the authorities have “bought time.” Spain will
publish the stress tests on an individual basis. The country
sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of 10-year and 30-year
bonds, the maximum set for the auction, as a decline in prices
enticed buyers.  
 “Gold’s trading more as the preferred currency,”  David Baker , a managing partner of Baker Steel Capital Managers, said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview. People are “seeing
what’s happening in Europe with the issues in Greece and now
Spain and potentially Portugal and they’re looking for an
alternative. Gold’s the safest port of call,” he said. Gold may
reach between $1,450 and $1,470 an ounce this year, he said.  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged for a fourth day
yesterday at a record 1,306.14 metric tons, according to the
company’s website.  
 Silver for July delivery in New York was 0.2 percent higher
at $18.485 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery increased 0.7
percent to $1,578.30 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
added 0.2 percent to $476.35 an ounce.
