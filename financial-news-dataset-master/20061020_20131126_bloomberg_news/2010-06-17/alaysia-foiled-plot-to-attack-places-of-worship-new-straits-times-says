             Malaysia uncovered a terror plot
to blow up places of worship in Penang and Selangor after
arresting nine foreigners and a Malaysian student near Kuala
Lumpur earlier this year, the New Straits Times reported, citing
unidentified police officials.  
 One of the men probably had links with al-Qaeda and was on
a mission to recruit members for the international group and
Southeast Asia terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, according to the
report. The foreigners were sent to their home countries in
April, where they have been detained, it said.
