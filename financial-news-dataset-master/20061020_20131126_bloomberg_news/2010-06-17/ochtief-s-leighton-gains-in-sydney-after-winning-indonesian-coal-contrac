             Leighton Holdings Ltd., Australia’s
largest construction company, rose to a one-month high in Sydney
trading after it won A$1.5 billion ($1.3 billion) in contracts,
including work on a coal mine expansion in Indonesia.  
 Leighton , a unit of Germany’s Hochtief AG, gained 3.6
percent to A$33.46 at 11:08 a.m. local time on the Australian
stock exchange. That’s the highest since May 14.  
 Leighton signed a six-year A$1.1 billion contract with PT
Mahakam Sumber Jaya for its MSJ coal mine in East Kalimantan,
the Sydney-based company said today in a statement.  BHP Billiton
Ltd.  awarded Leighton’s Thiess Services unit a A$405 million
contract for remediation work at the former Newcastle steelworks
in New South Wales state.
