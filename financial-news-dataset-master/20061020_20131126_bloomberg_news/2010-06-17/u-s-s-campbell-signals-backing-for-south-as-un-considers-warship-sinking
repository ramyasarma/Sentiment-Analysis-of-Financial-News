             U.S. envoy  Kurt Campbell  appeared
alongside South Korean Foreign Minister  Yu Myung Hwan  in Seoul
today in a show of unity as the United Nations Security Council
began discussing allegations North Korea torpedoed the South’s
Cheonan warship.  
 “We are determined to show that our alliance is standing
very firmly together during an absolutely critical period of
time,” Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia,
said at the beginning of talks with Yu. The two countries are
“taking an appropriate and responsible set of responses to the
Cheonan tragedy,” Campbell said later as he began talks with
South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Chun Yung Woo.  
 North Korea’s Ambassador to the UN, Sin Son Ho, warned this
week his nation will respond militarily to any accusation by the
UN Security Council of complicity in the March 26 sinking of the
1,200-ton Cheonan. Backed by the U.S. and Japan, South Korea is
asking for Security Council condemnation of  Kim Jong Il ’s regime
for the attack, which killed 46 sailors.  
 “This is a good opportunity to show to the world what our
alliance is about and how well it works,” Chun said today in
Seoul.  
 The multinational team that said on May 20 a North Korean
torpedo caused the sinking briefed the Security Council on its
evidence on June 14.  
 China and Russia, which have veto power on the council,
have resisted criticizing Kim’s regime for the attack.
