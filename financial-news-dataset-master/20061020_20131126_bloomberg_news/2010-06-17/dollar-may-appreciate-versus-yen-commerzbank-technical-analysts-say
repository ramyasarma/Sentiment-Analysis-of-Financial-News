             The dollar may reach 93.50 against
Japan’s currency should it hold above a so-called support area
between 90.97 and 90.85 yen, Commerzbank AG said, citing
technical indicators.  
 The 90.97 level is an upward sloping support line,
according to  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in London. The 90.85
figure represents last week’s low, she said.  
 “We favor recovery from 90.97/90.85, looking for another
upside attempt to 93.50 yen, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the selloff in May,” Jones wrote in an e-mailed
report today. A break above 93.50 “retargets the high around
95.00,” reached in May, Jones said.  
 The dollar weakened 0.3 percent to 91.18 yen as of 8:51
a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A support level is an area on a chart where
technical analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and a
resistance level is an area there they anticipate sell orders.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
