             Crude oil extended earlier losses
after a report showed the number of Americans seeking jobless
benefits last week unexpectedly rose to a one-month high.  
 Crude oil for July delivery fell 81 cents, or 1 percent, to
$76.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 1:34
p.m. London time.
