             BP Plc , the target of more than 220
lawsuits over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, is seeking to borrow
at least $5 billion from banks to meet compensation payments,
according to two bankers approached by the company.  
 BP has asked lenders for one-year credit lines, one of the
people said. It is arranging the transactions individually with
banks, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the talks are private. The financing is in addition to BP’s
$10.5 billion of undrawn lines, the people said.  
 The funds may give BP additional flexibility if borrowing
in bond markets becomes too expensive after the company’s  debt 
was cut six levels to BBB from AA by Fitch Ratings June 15.
Standard & Poor’s said today that it cut the company’s long-term
credit rating two steps from AA- to A. The company had $27.7
billion in cash flow from operations in 2009.  
 “It’s surprising they have to resort to these measures
given they could have funded this out of free cash flow,” said
 Mark Routt , a Houston-based senior consultant with KBC Energy
Economics. “This is likely to be calculated to restore
confidence in the market. Something had to be done.”  
 Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for the London-based
company, declined to comment on financing arrangements.  
 BP’s debt rallied after the oil company pledged asset
sales, abandoned the $10 billion-a-year dividend and agreed to
create a $20 billion escrow fund to pay damages for the biggest
oil spill in American history.  
 S&P Downgrade  
 The company’s $750 million of 1.55 percent notes due 2011
were trading at 94.75 cents on the dollar today after tumbling
as low as 87.9 cents yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The cost of protecting BP’s debt against default for
one year has declined to 631.4 basis points after climbing to as
 high  as 1,075 yesterday, CMA DataVision prices show.  
 Among reasons for its credit downgrade, S&P cited higher
oil leak estimates and a U.S. Congressional hearing, saying they
increase potential liabilities for BP. The oil company’s short-
term credit rating was also cut by one step to A-1 from the
highest grade. S&P said its outlook is still negative.
