             The International Monetary Fund
welcomed the results of a Spanish bond auction and said
decisions by Spain and Germany to publish results of stress
tests on banks will boost financial market confidence.  
 “Clearly the Spanish auction is considered to have gone
rather well,” said  Caroline Atkinson , the IMF’s director of
external relations, at a press briefing today in Washington.
“Also, we do view the decision in Spain, and Germany as well,
on publishing stress tests as very positive.”  
 She said “uncertainty” is one of the biggest issues
affecting confidence in financial systems, and the publication
of bank stress-test results “can be very helpful” by giving
investors more information.  
 Atkinson also said there is “no truth” to rumors that
Spain is seeking an IMF loan, and she also said she was not
aware of any preliminary discussions that might lead to such a
request. She said the IMF supports Spain’s efforts to rein in
its budget deficit.  
 “We believe that the targets that they have announced are
fully appropriate,” Atkinson said.  
 While financial risk is a drag on Europe’s economy, a
weaker euro has been a “positive” for the region, Atkinson
said. She said the IMF plans to update its World Economic
Outlook on July 8 in Hong Kong, as the global economy
strengthens and downside risks remain.  
 Atkinson said IMF staff will begin a staff mission to
Ukraine on June 21 to discuss issues facing that country.
