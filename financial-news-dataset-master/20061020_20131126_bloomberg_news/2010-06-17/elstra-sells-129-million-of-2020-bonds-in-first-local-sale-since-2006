             Telstra Corp Ltd. , Australia’s
largest phone company, sold A$150 million ($129 million) of 10-
year bonds in its first domestic debt issue since 2006.  
 The 7.75 percent notes were priced to yield 200 basis
points more than the 10-year swap rate, sale manager National
Australia Bank Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The sale, requested by domestic investors, “follows on
from long-dated deals by Telstra in euro, Hong Kong dollars and
New Zealand dollars, and completes its borrowing program for the
2010 financial year,” said  Patrick Mullins , global co-head of
capital markets origination at National Australia Bank.  
 It is the first domestic bond sale by an Australian non-
financial issuer since Dexus Property Group sold A$180 million
of 8.75 percent notes on April 15, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Telstra scrapped a domestic bond sale plan in
November after it couldn’t reach an agreement with investors on
the terms of the securities, two people familiar with the plan
said at the time. Spokesman Craig Middleton didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call today seeking comment.  
 The company, based in Melbourne, last sold Australian-
dollar denominated bonds in December 2006, when it issued A$275
million of 10-year floating rate notes that pay a coupon of 65
basis points more than the bank bill swap rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.

 Telstra has been in talks with the government since
September on separating some of its operations to allow the
creation of a proposed high-speed fiber Internet network, in
return for cash or an equity stake. Fitch Ratings said in
February it has a negative outlook on the company’s A credit
rating, the sixth highest grade, because of the regulatory
uncertainty it faces.  
 The negotiations with government should be finished by the
end of June, Communications Minister Senator  Stephen Conroy  said
May 25.  
 The phone company, which has A$3.5 billion of debt  maturing 
in 2011, sold HK$330 million ($42 million) of 10-year notes this
month, after issuing NZ$100 million ($70 million) of 2017 debt
in May, the data show. It sold 1 billion euro ($1.23 billion) of
bonds on March 15, pricing the notes to yield 100.75 basis
points more than German government bonds. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.
