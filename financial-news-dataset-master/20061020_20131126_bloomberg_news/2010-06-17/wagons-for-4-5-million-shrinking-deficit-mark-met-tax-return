             A global oilfield provider of
engineering services and products received $4,519,709 from the
 Metropolitan Opera  for replacing the gigantic wheeled platforms
that bring the company’s massive sets to the stage.  
 Houston, Texas-based  Oceaneering International , which
features hypnotic videos on its website that could pass for
underwater scenes from an avant-garde staging of Wagner’s “Das
Rheingold,” also serves the defense and aerospace industries.  
 And, now, the U.S.’s biggest opera company. How diversified
is that?  
 The platforms, called wagons, haven’t been replaced since
the Met moved into its Lincoln Center home in 1966. They’re in
constant use, said Peter Clark, the company spokesman. The
replacement cost, he said, was covered by special gifts.  
 According to financial statements the Met released this
week for the year beginning August 1, 2008 and ending July 31,
2009, Oceaneering was one of five independent contractors paid
more than $100,000 each. Among the others, music director James
Levine earned $1,566,921 and advertising agency Serino Coyne
received $3,149,812.  
 Full-ish House  
 Despite energetic marketing, however, box-office income
fell slightly to $93.1 million from $93.5 million in 2007-08,
the first decline since 2002-03. Ticket sales remained constant,
with the Met selling 88 percent of its seats in the two most
recent seasons.  
 The Met’s operating deficit was $1.3 million, down from
$12.2 million a year earlier.  
 Contributions designated for operating costs rose 6 percent
to a record $127.3 million. Metropolitan Opera President  William C. Morris  credited its 125th anniversary fund campaign, led by
philanthropist  Mercedes Bass , and a fundraising effort tied to
the three “Ring” cycles performed in the spring of 2009.  
 Confronting a cash flow challenge, the Met also transferred
$7 million from its endowment and borrowed another $5 million
from it, according to the statements.  
 Two months later, the $5 million was returned and
reinvested, said Clark.  
 The loan came after the Met requested permission from 10
large donors to “unrestrict” $15 million earmarked for
specific projects. The Met also received permission from Chevron
Corp. to redirect $7 million the oil company had donated to the
endowment. The Met used that money for general purposes in the
2009-10 season.

 Morris said the opera had “significant financial
challenges,” which he attributed to the global recession.  
 Assets fell by $72.6 million, or 15 percent, to $422.7
million, primarily because of investment losses.  
 For the 12 months ending next month, the Met estimates its
deficit will be under $4 million, Clark said.  
 General Manager  Peter Gelb , whose preference for modern
stagings have brought back booing, if not yet vuvuzelas, to
opening nights, earned $1.5 million in pay and benefits in 2008,
about the same as in 2007-08.  
 Year-over-year pay comparisons aren’t possible, because the
Internal Revenue Service changed its requirement for reporting
pay from an organization’s fiscal year to the calendar year.
Clark said Gelb’s pay was cut in December 2008.  
 Big Employer  
 High-definition transmissions of performances to movie
theaters in 35 countries contributed to media revenue that
increased 75 percent, to $22 million. Clark said the HD
transmissions are profitable, but that radio broadcasts lose
money, before accounting for sponsorship and donations.
Altogether, the company lost $3.7 million on media.  
 Underscoring how dependant the Met is on donors and its
endowment, the company spent $213.6 million performing in 2008-
09 at Lincoln Center, on the symphony concerts it presents at
Carnegie Hall and on free opera in New York City parks. Its
earned revenue from those performances was less than half that.  
 The Met, which has approximately 1,500 full and part-time
employees, starts its new season on Sept. 27.
