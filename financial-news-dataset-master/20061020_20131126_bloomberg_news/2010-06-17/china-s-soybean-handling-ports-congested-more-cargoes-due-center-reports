             Congestion at China’s soybean-
unloading ports will persist this month as more cargoes arrive,
pushing up stockpiles in the country, the biggest buyer,
according to the China National Grain & Oils Information Center.  
 Qingdao and Rizhao ports in Shandong have reported
unloading difficulties, the center said, without stating how it
got the information. About 6 million metric tons of soybeans are
estimated to arrive in June, it said.  
 As many as nine more ships, each carrying about 60,000 tons
of soybeans, are scheduled to unload in Qingdao this month, in
addition to the two or three that have already been processed,
a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News
last week. Normally, there would be five, he said.  
 More than 100,000 tons of soybeans are stored in bags at
Qingdao Port and more are expected as traders without crushing
capacity seek space to keep their beans, said the person. The
situation at nearby Rizhao Port was worse because it has little
room to store beans, said the person, who had spoken to
officials there.  
 Soybean imports of 4.37 million tons in May were below
trade estimates of at least 5 million tons, according to Wang
Chen, head of research at Wanda Futures Co.
