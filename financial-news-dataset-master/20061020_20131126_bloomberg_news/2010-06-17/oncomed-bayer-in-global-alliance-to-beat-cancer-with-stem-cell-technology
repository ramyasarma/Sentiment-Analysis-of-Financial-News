             Bayer AG  agreed to work with  OncoMed
Pharmaceuticals Inc.  to develop cancer drugs that fight a group
of cells that drive tumor growth and resist chemotherapy.  
 Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, will pay $40 million
to OncoMed and in return get the option to buy the rights to as
many as five drug candidates at any point up to the completion
of the first phase of clinical trials, according to a statement
today from the companies. After exercising an option, Bayer
would take over the development and commercialization of the
product.  
 The venture may help Bayer add to its stable of cancer
medicines, which include Nexavar for liver and kidney tumors, as
well as experimental treatments that are in late-stage tests.
Bayer and OncoMed will develop drugs aimed at so-called cancer
stem cells. OncoMed tests show some experimental antibodies
aimed at a network of proteins known as the Wnt signaling
pathway damaged those cells in several kinds of solid tumors.  
 OncoMed, a closely held company based in Redwood City,
California, stands to receive as much as $387.5 million for each
antibody or protein drug that receives regulatory approval,
according to the statement. The agreement includes the U.S.
company’s lead candidate, OMP-18R5, which is scheduled to enter
clinical testing next year.  
 OncoMed also would be eligible for “double-digit”
royalties on sales.  
 OncoMed’s  shareholders  include eight investment firms,
among them  Adams Street Partners  and Bay Partners, as well as
drugmakers Roche Holding AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, according
to the company’s website. The company was founded in 2004 by two
doctors, Michael F. Clarke and  Max Wicha , who led the discovery
of cancer stem cells, according to the website.
