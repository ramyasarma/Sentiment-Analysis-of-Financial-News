             The University of Utah accepted an
invitation to join the  Pacific-10 Conference  beginning with the
2011 season, the school said at a press conference.  
 The Salt Lake City university is the second school to join
the conference, following the University of Colorado’s decision
to leave the Big 12 on June 10.  
 School President  Michael K. Young  said the university will
also benefit from an academic association with its new
conference.  
 “This is a great day to be a Ute,” Young said at the
press conference. “The opportunity to play with these great
schools is something that we look forward to very much.  
 “It is a conference of imagination, innovation and
captures all of the innovation centers of the West.”  
 The announcement caps a two-week period in which several
schools switched conferences.  
 The University of Nebraska left the Big 12 for the Big Ten
Conference and Boise State University in Idaho left the Western
Athletic Conference for the Mountain West Conference, where Utah
currently plays.  
 Meanwhile, the Big 12 avoided potential dissolution two
days ago when the University of Texas passed up an offer to join
the Pac-10 after it was assured it would receive higher
television revenue in the Big 12’s next network contract and
that it could start its own television network separate of the
conference agreement.
