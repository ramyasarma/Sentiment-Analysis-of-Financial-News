             Portugal’s Finance Ministry will 
postpone a bond issue of 3 billion euros that was planned to 
be carried out by the end of this month through a syndicate of 
banks, Diario Economico reported, citing an unidentified 
official at the ministry.  
 The postponement is explained by the present situation in 
markets, the Finance Ministry official said, according to the 
Portuguese newspaper. Instead of new syndicated debt issues, 
the Finance Ministry has preferred alternatives that involve 
increasing issues of existing lines of bonds and bills, Diario 
said.
