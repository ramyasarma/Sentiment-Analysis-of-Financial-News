             Coal of Africa Ltd. said an
independent study of its Makhado project in northern South
Africa suggesting a coal resource 8.5 percent lower than the
company’s estimate was “very conservative,” Business Day
reported.  
 The study carried out by The Mineral Corp. showed a
mineable resource of 947 million metric tons at Makhado,
compared with the company’s figure of 1.04 billion tons, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Managing Director
Simon Farrell.
