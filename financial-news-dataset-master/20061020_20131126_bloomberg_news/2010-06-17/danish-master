             At a converted warehouse
in Copenhagen, Noma advances Nordic cuisine and passes El Bulli
to become the world’s No. 1 restaurant.  
 Food lovers around the world who thought scoring a table at Chef
Ferran Adria’s El Bulli in Catalonia, Spain, meant grabbing the
gastronomic holy grail might want to consider a new challenge:
Noma in Copenhagen. Noma received 100,000 e-mail booking
inquiries the day after being named the world’s best restaurant
on April 26.  
 While El Bulli and the U.K.’s Fat Duck have dominated the S.
Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants list published by
Restaurant magazine since 2002, Noma’s climb to surpass them has
been dizzying. It was 33rd in 2006 and 15th a year later; it
came in 10th in 2008; and it was third last year, when it won
the Chef’s Choice award as the favorite among culinary masters.  
 Not bad for a small eatery in a converted warehouse in the
Christianshavn district of Copenhagen, a beautiful city but not
one of the world’s prime culinary destinations.  
 Noma is unpretentious. You dine in a charming old room with a
wooden floor and candles in each of the windows. Plates are
delivered to the table by young cooks who explain the multiple
dishes, which offer novel ingredients and unusual combinations,
such as carrots and buttermilk licorice. Still, Noma isn’t about
the shock of the new. It’s about rediscovering and refining a
cuisine that--like so many--had been diluted and diverted by the
seductive and exciting embrace of Gallic gastronomy.  
 “The focus has changed in the past five to six years in
Copenhagen,” chef and owner Rene Redzepi says. “People are now
finding their roots again: discovering nature, discovering the
product range, the diversity, and by doing that, now you see the
shaping of a cuisine.”  
 At the center of Redzepi’s culinary art are fine, seasonal
Nordic ingredients: halibut, seaweed and curds from Iceland and
lamb, musk ox, berries and the purest drinking water from
Green­land, according to the restaurant’s website. Redzepi, 32,
can even tell you the name of the man who dived for your sea
urchins.
At lunch, there were six different types of canape, including
pickled quail eggs smoked on a bed of hay and smoked cod roe on
toast with vinegar. That’s before we got to the 10-course meal,
which included dishes such as squid and lingonberries topped
with cream and dill and sour grape juice from the isle of Lilleo
with caramelized onions and thyme leaves.  
 The portions are small, so you can focus on the clean flavors
and the quality of the produce. Such special Nordic ingredients
don’t come cheap. The seven-course tasting menu is 995 kroner
($180) plus service; matching wines are 895 kroner (or have
juices for 395 kroner); and the lunch menu is 595 kroner.  
 Noma isn’t another El Bulli or another Fat Duck. It’s Noma and
it’s very, very good. In fact, it’s this year’s best restaurant.
