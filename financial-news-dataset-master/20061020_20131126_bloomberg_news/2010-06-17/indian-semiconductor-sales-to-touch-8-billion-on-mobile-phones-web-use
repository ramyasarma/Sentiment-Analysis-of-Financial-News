             Indian semiconductor sales may reach
$8 billion at the end of next year as people purchase more
mobile phones and computers in the world’s second-most populous
nation.  
 The growth of the country’s semiconductor market is
forecast to accelerate by an average 22 percent annually this
year and next, according to a report by the India Semiconductor
Association and Frost & Sullivan Inc. today. Sales gained 16
percent to $5.39 billion in 2009, the report said.  
 Rising income in India is fueling the use of mobile phones
and high-speed Internet connections, boosting demand for
semiconductors.  Economic growth  in Asia’s third-largest economy
will accelerate to 8.5 percent in the year to March 31 from 7.4
percent in the previous year, according to the government.  
 Salaries in India may increase at the fastest pace in the
Asia Pacific region in 2010, according to Hewitt Associates Inc.,
the Lincolnshire, Illinois-based human resources adviser.  
 “Big growth is expected due to rollout of third-generation
services and growth in broadband wireless access,” said Niju V.,
a deputy director for South Asia and Middle East at Frost &
Sullivan.  
 Nine companies bid 509.7 billion rupees for licenses to
offer 3G mobile-phone services May 19.  
 India will account for 2.3 percent of the global
semiconductor market by the end of the year, according to the
report. Sales globally declined 11 percent in 2008, it said.
