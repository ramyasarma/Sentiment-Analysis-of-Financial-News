             General Electric Co. , through its
finance arm, sold $850 million of bonds backed by credit-card
payments, GE’s biggest such sale in nine months, according to a
person familiar with the offering.  
 The top-rated securities, maturing in about three years,
yield 75 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
aren’t public. The issue was increased in size from $500
million.  
 Sales of asset-backed bonds tied to credit card payments
have plunged this year amid a pullback in household debt. About
$4.9 billion of the securities, have been sold in 2010,
including today’s offering, compared with $24.9 billion in the
year-ago period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Top-rated securities backed by credit-card payments yield
about 72 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
compared with a low for the year of 53 basis points over
benchmarks on April 21, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Credit-card charge-offs have peaked, Barclays Plc said
yesterday in a report. Charge-offs, or accounts deemed
uncollectible, will decline to as low as 9.75 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with 10.8 percent in the year-earlier
period, New York-based analyst  Joseph Astorina  wrote in the
report.  
 “Credit card default performance has turned the corner,”
he said.  
 Today’s sale is GE’s biggest offering of credit-card debt
since it issued $952.5 million of bonds Sept. 14, according to
Bloomberg data.
