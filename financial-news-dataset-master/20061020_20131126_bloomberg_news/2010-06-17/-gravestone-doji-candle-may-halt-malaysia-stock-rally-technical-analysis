             Malaysian stocks may snap an eight-
day rally after the  benchmark index  formed a “gravestone doji”
candle yesterday, signaling a potential reversal amid indecision,
according to RHB Research Institute Sdn.  
 The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  formed the  pattern  by
trading well above the open and then closing little changed. The
candle, which looks like an inverted “T,” typically occurs at
the end of a prolonged trend. The  gauge  may fall below the
“psychological” level of 1,300 and the 10-day moving average
near 1,294 “soon,” RHB said in a report today.  
 “The index needs to sustain above 1,300 to avoid a sudden
fall back to below” those levels, RHB said. “Losing these
levels will refresh the bearish momentum.”  
 Candlestick charts show an index or security’s high, low,
open and close each day, and may signal a reversal of a trend or
a continuation. In technical analysis, investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes
in a security, commodity, currency or index.  
 The Malaysian  index  rose as much as 1.1 percent to 1,312.10
yesterday before ending the day at 1,303.13, almost the same as
the 1,303.14 open. The gauge today climbed 0.2 percent to
1,306.17 as of the 12:30 p.m. local-time break, set for its
 longest winning streak  since a 12-day gain through April 7.
