             Mitsui & Co. , Japan’s second-largest
trading company, plans to boost its commodities trading staff by
6.4 percent in the year ending March 2011, to meet increasing
demand for risk management.  
 “We intend to add new talent at a steady pace and expect
to have about 250 people within this fiscal year,”  Kenichi Hori ,
general manager of the commodity trading and risk management
unit, said in an interview yesterday.  
 Mitsui joins  Sumitomo Corp.  and  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc.  in expanding their raw-material hedging business.
Copper has jumped 34 percent in the past year and oil is up 9
percent on demand led by China. Gold has climbed 12 percent this
year following nine straight annual gains and reached an all-
time high on June 8.  
 “The need for risk management of commodities is as strong
as ever,” Hori said.  
 The unit has about 235 people, including 95 in London, 60
in New York and 80 in Asia Pacific, Hori said. Mitsui plans to
add risk management staff that will trade products such as corn,
wheat, soybeans and sugar, Hori said. It mostly trades energy,
base metals and precious metals, he said.  
 The company is studying the possibility of expanding its
commodity derivatives trading in China, Hori said.  
 “We are reviewing our business each year and we may hire
more staff next fiscal year in Asia if we reach a conclusion on
business strategies in new commodities and China,” Hori said.  
 Sumitomo Corp. Global Commodities Ltd., a London-based unit
of  Sumitomo Corp. , said May 13 it plans to boost staff by 28
percent within two years, according to  Koichi Iwanaga , general
manager of Sumitomo’s commodity business department.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International, a unit of Japan’s
biggest bank by market value, may boost its staff in London by
25 percent this year,  Tetsuro Kono , who heads the commodity
derivative group, said April 27.
