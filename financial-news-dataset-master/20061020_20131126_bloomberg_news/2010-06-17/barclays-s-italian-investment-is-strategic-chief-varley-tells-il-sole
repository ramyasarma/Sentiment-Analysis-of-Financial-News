             Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, plans to invest in Italy as it’s a “strategic
country,” Chief Executive Officer  John Varley  told  Il Sole 24
Ore  in an interview.  
 The lender aims to invest in “retail, wealth, corporate
and investment banking” to increase its services” offer in the
country, the Italian newspaper cited the CEO as saying.  
 Varley also said that reforms in the banking sector should
be implemented gradually.  
 “While new rules to reduce risks, such as leverage
reduction, should be introduced soon, other reforms that can
slow down the economic growth should be implemented in the
medium term,” he told the newspaper.
