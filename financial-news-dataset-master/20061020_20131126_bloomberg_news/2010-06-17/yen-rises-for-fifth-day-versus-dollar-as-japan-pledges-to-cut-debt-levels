             The yen gained for a fifth day
against the dollar after Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
pledged to cut the world’s largest public debt, saying failure
to do so may undermine the country’s sovereignty.  
 Japan’s currency rose versus all of its major counterparts
as Kan also said he’d consider the opposition Liberal Democratic
Party’s proposal to raise the consumption tax to 10 percent. The
remarks, which came after the Democratic Party of Japan released
its manifesto for next month’s Upper House election, show the
government’s increased willingness to tackle debt that is
approaching 200 percent of gross domestic product.  
 “The structural reforms appear to be aimed at securing
funding sources,” said  Yuji Saito , director of the foreign-
exchange department at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment
Bank in Tokyo. “This is likely to be positive for the yen.”  
 The yen rose to 90.87 per dollar as of 8:37 a.m. in Tokyo
from 91.01 in New York yesterday, when it climbed to 90.51, the
strongest since May 27. The currency gained to 112.63 per euro
from 112.76. The euro traded at $1.2393 from $1.2389 yesterday,
when it advanced to $1.2413, the highest since May 28.  
 The yen headed for a second weekly gain versus the dollar
after the DPJ, in an election document distributed to reporters
yesterday, called for cross-party talks on raising Japan’s 5
percent consumption tax. The plan also reiterated a goal of 3
percent annual economic growth over the next 10 years.  
 “Unless we work on fiscal rehabilitation, an international
organization such as the International Monetary Fund could
control our fiscal management,” Kan said yesterday. “We must
rehabilitate our finances with our own power without relying on
other countries.”  
 Spanish Auction  
 The euro headed for its biggest weekly advance versus the
dollar in more than a year as increased demand at Spain’s bond
auction eased concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  
 Spain sold 3 billion euros ($3.71 billion) of 10-year debt
at an average yield of 4.864 percent, less than the 5.04 percent
that the bonds traded at yesterday before the sale. Demand was
1.89 times the amount on offer. The nation also sold 479.2
million euros of 30-year debt at 5.908 percent, with a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.45, higher than the 1.38 at the previous sale
on March 18.  
 “The yields were a little higher than previously but they
were able to finance their deficit at costs that weren’t
prohibitive,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy
at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “The fact that we got through
the Spanish bond auction without something going awry is good.
We’ve had some resilient trading in the euro.”  
 European Union leaders yesterday agreed to disclose how
banks perform on stress tests, seeking to show investors the
financial system can withstand shocks.
