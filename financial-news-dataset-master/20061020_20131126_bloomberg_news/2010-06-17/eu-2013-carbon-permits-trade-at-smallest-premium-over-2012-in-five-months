             The premium of European Union carbon
dioxide permits for December 2013 delivery compared with 2012
declined to its narrowest in five months as lawmakers from
around the world fail to set greenhouse gas limits.  
 The spread between EU carbon allowances for 2013 over
2012, traded as a separate contract on London’s European Climate
Exchange, narrowed 7.8 percent to 95 euro cents ($1.17) a metric
ton today. That’s the smallest gap since Jan. 14.  
 The BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is unlikely to
create enough momentum to pass a comprehensive climate bill in
the U.S. sought by President Barack Obama, said leading Senate
Democrats, including Senator Dianne Feinstein of California.
Targets for industrialized nations under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol
run for the five years through 2012.  
 Politicians from nations including the U.S. and Australia
need to enact laws that treat climate-change as a real and
urgent problem, said Alexander Winzer, managing director of
Climate Corp., which develops projects in China that yield
tradable carbon offset credits. That’s not happening yet, he
said today.  
 “It’s a bit like talking about the ghost that you can’t
see,” said Winzer, who was speaking by phone from Merryweather,
near Sydney, Australia.  
 Carbon dioxide allowances for December 2010 rose 0.6
percent to 15.66 euros ($19.23) a ton. UN credits for December
rose 1.3 percent to 13.16 euros.
