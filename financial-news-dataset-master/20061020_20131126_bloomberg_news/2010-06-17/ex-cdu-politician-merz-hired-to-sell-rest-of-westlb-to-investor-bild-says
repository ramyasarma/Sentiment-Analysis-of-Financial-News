             The German government has given
 Friedrich Merz , a lawyer who used to be deputy head of the
Christian Democratic Union’s parliamentary group, the job of
selling the remaining government stake in WestLB to a private
investor,  Bild  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 The share is worth about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion),
and Merz agreed to close the sale by the end of next year, the
newspaper said.
