             A former property developer and
former law firm partner were charged with conspiracy to commit
fraud after allegedly using false documents to get a 22 million-
euro ($27 million) bank loan from a unit of Zurich-based  EFG
International AG .  
 Michael Shephard, 49, obtained the loan in 2008 by stating
he had 76 million pounds on deposit at Bank Julius Baer in
Guernsey, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed
statement today. He was helped by Kevin Steele, formerly a
lawyer at  Mishcon de Reya Solicitors  in London, the SFO said.  
 Steele abused his position in relation to “an undertaking
given to EFG Bank in respect of the EFG loan, the general
mishandling of the Michael Andrew Shephard client account and
the theft of 1.8 million pounds from that account” to pay an
unrelated claim, the SFO said.  
 The men were charged today at a London court and released
on bail, the SFO said. EFG International spokesman  Keith Gapp 
didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  
 “On behalf of Mr. Shephard, we’d be most interested to see
what evidence the SFO has to introduce to support the charges,”
Shephard’s lawyer, Stephen Gilchrist, said.  
 Steele’s lawyer Nick Brett couldn’t immediately be reached.  
 “Kevin Steele was expelled from Mishcon de Reya in
September 2008, nearly two years ago,” the firm said in an e-
mailed statement. “The firm carried out a thorough internal
investigation and brought in the police and the Solicitors
Regulation Authority. It has ensured that the interests of its
clients have been fully protected.”
