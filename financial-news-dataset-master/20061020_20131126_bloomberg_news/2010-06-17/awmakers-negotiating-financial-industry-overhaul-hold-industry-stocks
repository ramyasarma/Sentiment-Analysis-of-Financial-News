             Lawmakers writing the biggest
overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression may
have a stake in the outcome.  
 Eight of 11 senators and six of 22 House members on a
conference committee writing the final legislation own stocks in
financial companies affected by the legislation, disclosure
statements released yesterday show.  
 One senator and nine representatives who also sit on the
committee got extensions of the filing deadline and haven’t yet
disclosed their holdings.  
 “It’s always a concern that personal interests influence
legislation,” said Lisa Gilbert, a lobbyist for the  U.S. Public
Interest Research Group , a Boston-based organization pushing for
stronger financial regulations.  
 The 43 negotiators are trying to iron out differences
between the House and Senate versions of the legislation as they
respond to an economic crisis that forced the U.S. to provide
$700 billion in bailout funds for New York-based Citigroup Inc.;
Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp.  and other
banks. The measure passed the Senate last month and the House in
December.  
 Senator  Mike Crapo , an Idaho Republican, reported
purchasing 222 shares of Citigroup in October. Spokeswoman Susan
Wheeler said the senator “doesn’t make any decisions” on what
stocks to buy, leaving it to a broker.  
 Republican Senator  Judd Gregg  of New Hampshire reported
Bank of America stock holdings and a savings account valued
between $1 million and $5 million, plus lesser amounts in banks
including McLean, Virginia-based  Capital One Financial Corp.  and
 New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A phone call to Gregg’s
office wasn’t returned.  
 CME Group  
 Senate Banking Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd ’s wife,
 Jackie Clegg Dodd , is on the board of CME Group Inc., the
world’s largest futures market, and held between $250,000 and
$500,000 in CME stock, according to the Connecticut Democrat’s
filings.  
 On the House side, Republican Representative  Shelley Moore Capito ’s husband, Charles, is an executive vice president at
Parkersburg, West Virginia-based  United Bankshares Inc . The
couple reported owning between $65,000 and $150,000 of stock in
Citigroup, Charles Capito’s former employer.  
 Joel Brubaker, Capito’s chief of staff, said the House
ethics committee approved of her service on the Financial
Services Committee even though her husband was in the banking
business. “They gave her a green light,” Brubaker said.  
 Finance Committee  
 Separately, Democratic Massachusetts Senator  John Kerry , a
member of the tax-writing Finance Committee who has criticized
legislation raising taxes on executives of venture capital
firms, reported that wife  Teresa Heinz Kerry  had at least $54.3
million invested in privately run funds. That includes more than
$2 million with Polaris Venture Partners of Waltham,
Massachusetts, and Salix Ventures II LP, run by Salix Management
Corp.  
 His wife also invested between $1.5 million and $3 million
in a fund run by her son, Andre Heinz, from the offshore tax
haven Guernsey in the British Isles. Andre Heinz’s Sustainable
Technologies Fund focuses on companies developing clean energy
products in Scandinavia.  
 “It’s preposterous to conclude that his wife’s holdings in
inherited trusts that he has zero control over would affect his
judgment or commitment to the serious work being done here to
hold Wall Street accountable and rein in reckless corporate
spending,” said Senator Kerry’s spokeswoman,  Whitney Smith .
