             U.S. stocks halted a global advance,
while Treasuries and gold rallied, as an unexpected increase in
jobless claims and lower-than-estimated growth in Philadelphia
manufacturing cast doubt on the strength of the economic
recovery.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,112.05 at 10:11 a.m. in New York and the MSCI World Index
erased most of an earlier gain that would have extended its
longest rally in 11 months. The yield on the 10-year Treasury
note fell 5 basis points to 3.21 percent and gold for immediate
delivery jumped 1.4 percent to $1,246.22 an ounce.
