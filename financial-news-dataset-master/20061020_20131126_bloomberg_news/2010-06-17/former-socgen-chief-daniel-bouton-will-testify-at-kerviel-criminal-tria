             Societe Generale SA ’s former
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Daniel Bouton  will testify
next week at the trial of  Jerome Kerviel  over the bank’s 4.9
billion-euro ($6 billion) trading  loss .  
 Judge Dominique Pauthe said at a hearing today that Bouton
should testify June 22. Societe Generale investors, who joined
the criminal trial as civil parties and have the right to seek
damages from Kerviel, had requested Bouton’s testimony.  
 Bouton “will be there,” Societe Generale lawyer  Jean Veil 
told the judge.  
 Bouton, who called Kerviel a “terrorist,” offered to
resign following the Jan. 24, 2008, disclosure of the trading
loss and was turned down by the bank’s board. He gave up his
chief executive officer title to  Frederic Oudea  in April of that
year following a 5.5 billion-euro capital raising campaign. He
stepped down as chairman in 2009.  
 Kerviel, 33, faces charges of faking documents, abuse of
trust, and computer hacking.
