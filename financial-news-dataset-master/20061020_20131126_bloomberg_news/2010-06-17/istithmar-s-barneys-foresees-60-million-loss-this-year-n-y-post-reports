             Barneys New York expects to lose 
more than $60 million this year, the New York Post reported, 
citing an unidentified person briefed on the retailer’s 
financial plans.  
 While the company, owned by Istithmar World PJSC of Dubai, 
has experienced a recent recovery in demand for luxury items, 
it still has a $500 million debt burden and lost $20 million in
the first quarter, the newspaper said.
