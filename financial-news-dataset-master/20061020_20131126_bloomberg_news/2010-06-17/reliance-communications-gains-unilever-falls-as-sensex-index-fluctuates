             India’s benchmark stock index
completed its longest string of gains in almost 10 months as
investors bought shares in companies that may benefit as the
nation’s economy expands.  
 Reliance Communications Ltd. rose to its highest level in
almost eight months after Hindu BusinessLine said it may raise
cash by selling stakes in a unit.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , the
nation’s largest state-owned oil explorer, gained 1.9 percent
after Deutsche Bank AG advised investors to buy the stock.  
 “Investors are buying selectively,” said  D.K. Aggarwal ,
who oversees funds for rich individuals as chairman of SMC
Wealth Management Services Ltd. in New Delhi. “The market will
remain very volatile, but India is doing well.” Aggarwal, who
declined to say how much the firm manages, said he prefers
Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and Reliance Industries Ltd.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
rose 153.82, or 0.9 percent, to 17,616.69, its highest close
since April 27, after swinging between gains and losses at least
14 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
gained 0.8 percent to 5,274.85. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.7
percent to 2,224.10.  
 Reliance Communications  
 Reliance Communications advanced 2.4 percent to 191.7
rupees. The company may raise $500 million from selling a 26
percent stake in Reliance Globalcom, a private undersea cable
system operator, Hindu BusinessLine reported, without saying
where it got the information. Reliance Communications spokesman
 Gaurav Wahi  couldn’t be reached for comment on his cell phone.  
 Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , the nation’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, gained 1.9 percent to 1,186.05 rupees.  Harshad Katkar , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, rated Oil & Natural and
GAIL India Ltd. as “buy” in new coverage. GAIL, a monopoly gas
distributor, advanced 2.5 percent to 475.15 rupees.  
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd., the biggest engineering company,
climbed 3.2 percent to 1,777 rupees. Reliance Industries Ltd.,
operator of the world’s largest oil processing complex,
increased 1.3 percent to 1,071.4 rupees.  
 India’s use of diesel and gasoline increased 11 percent
last month from a year earlier as the economy continued to grow,
according to data by state oil companies. Industrial production
increased 17.6 percent in April, close to a December record.  
 ‘Reduce’ Unilever  
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. fell after its rating was cut to
“reduce” from “neutral” at Nomura Holdings Inc. The unit of
the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker declined 1.1
percent to 253 rupees, retreating for a second day.  Manish Jain 
and  Anup Sudhendranath , analysts at Nomura, said in a note to
investors that competition and the company’s focus on regaining
lost market share will keep margins under pressure.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  6.93 billion rupees  ($148.3
million) of Indian equities June 15, increasing total purchases
of stocks this year to 241.1 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Fortis Healthcare Ltd.  (FORH IN), a hospital operator,
gained 1.9 percent to 154.95 percent after the Financial Express
reported Reliance Industries Ltd. may buy a stake. A Fortis
Healthcare spokesperson denied the report, the newspaper said.
Chairman Malvinder Singh didn’t answer a call to his cell phone.  
 Ramsarup Industries Ltd.  (RAMI IN), a maker of steel wire,
surged 11 percent to 81 rupees, the most in more than two months,
after Business Standard said ArcelorMittal may buy a stake in
the company.  Ashish Jhunjhunwala , chairman of Ramsarup, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment on his office phone.
Mandakini Sud, an AcelorMittal India spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  
 Religare Enterprises Ltd.  (RELG IN), a financial services
company, tumbled 7 percent to 393.2 rupees, its steepest slide
in a year. About 1.8 percent of its equity changed hands in
eight transactions on the National Stock Exchange, according to
Bloomberg data. Buyers and sellers weren’t immediately known.
