             The Kiel-based Institute for the
World Economy raised its growth outlook for the German economy
this year, saying the weakening euro is helping boost demand for
German manufactured goods.  
 The German economy, Europe’s biggest, will expand 2.1
percent this year, the institute said today in an e-mailed
report, after forecasting 1.2 percent growth in March.  
 “Economic dynamism in the first half of the year is
probably much higher than we estimated in March,” the institute
said today in an e-mailed report.
