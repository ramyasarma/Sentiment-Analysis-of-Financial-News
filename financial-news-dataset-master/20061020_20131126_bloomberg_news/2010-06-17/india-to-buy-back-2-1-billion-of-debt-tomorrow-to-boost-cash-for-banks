             India will buy back 100 billion
rupees ($2.1 billion) of government securities through an
auction tomorrow to boost  cash  in the financial system.  
 The government will buy the bonds through a multiple
price-based “multi-security” auction, The  Reserve Bank of
India  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The auction
tomorrow is part of the government’s plan to buy as much as 200
billion rupees of debt in one or more tranches, it said.  
 Overnight interbank  rates  climbed to as much as 5.4
percent yesterday from 4.9 percent at the end of May. Banks
borrowed an average 375 billion rupees a day from the central
bank through its repurchase-auction window this month,
indicating a shortage of cash after license-fee payments by
phone companies. Last month, they lent a daily average of 328
billion rupees of surplus to the central bank.  
 “It’s a short-term measure to address a temporary
tightening in liquidity and will help infusing confidence among
investors,” said  Srinivasa Raghavan , head of fixed-income
trading in Mumbai at IDBI Gilts. The yield on the benchmark 10-
year bond may drop as much as 10 basis points today, he said.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
seven basis points yesterday to 7.59 percent as of the 5:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  
 The  finance ministry  will tomorrow repurchase the 12.25
percent notes maturing in 2010, 11.3 percent securities due
2010 and 6.57 percent debt maturing 2011, it said in the
statement.  
 Cash availability has dropped after the government raised
677.2 billion rupees from last month’s auction of mobile-phone
permits prompting the central bank to ease  bond reserve
requirement  rules until July 2.

 The central bank said lenders can raise more cash by
cutting their debt  holdings  by as much as 0.5 percentage point
below the minimum regulatory requirement of 25 percent of
deposits. The Reserve Bank is also holding additional daily
money-market auctions to increase the availability of funds.  
 The government is also raising a combined 385.4 billion
rupees from winners of wireless broadband licenses by June 22.
Companies may pay up to 350 billion rupees in quarterly tax
this week, said  Pradeep Madhav , managing director of Mumbai-
based Securities Trading Corp. of India last week.  
 The Reserve Bank, whose next policy meeting is scheduled
on July 27, has raised  interest rates  twice since mid-March, by
a quarter-percentage point each time. The  reverse-repurchase 
rate, or the rate at which the central bank absorbs surplus
cash, is 3.75 percent, while the repurchase auction rate is
5.25 percent.
