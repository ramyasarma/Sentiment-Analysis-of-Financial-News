             Farmers in Saskatchewan, Canada’s
largest grain-growing region, planted 73 percent of their 2010
crop as of June 14, up from 70 percent a week earlier, according
to the province’s Ministry of Agriculture.  
 Excessive rainfall and flooding has slowed planting in the
province, according to the report. Topsoil moisture was 100
percent surplus or adequate, unchanged from a week earlier, the
ministry said today in its weekly  crop report .
