             European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said European Union leaders reached a “good
consensus” on bank stress tests.  
 “I think we have a good consensus on the stress tests,”
Trichet told reporters today in Brussels after a summit of EU
leaders. “I’m happy with that because we thought it was
appropriate.”  
 The results of the stress tests will be published “at the
latest the second half of July,” Trichet said.
