             The New Jersey Devils promoted
franchise goals leader  John MacLean  to head coach, filling the
vacancy created by  Jacques Lemaire ’s retirement.  
 MacLean, 45, will be introduced today at an afternoon news
conference, the Devils said on their  website . Contract terms
weren’t disclosed.  
 Lemaire retired in April, four days after the Devils lost
to the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the playoffs.  
 MacLean was the coach of New Jersey’s American Hockey
League affiliate in Lowell, Massachusetts, last season, leading
the four-year-old Lowell Devils to their first playoff
appearance. He was an assistant coach for the National Hockey
League franchise for seven previous seasons.  
 The two-time All-Star ended his 18-year NHL career in 2002
having tallied 413 goals and 429 assists in 1,194 games.  
 He played 14 seasons for the Devils, scoring a team-record
347 goals, and is second to  Patrik Elias  on the Devils’ all-time
points list. MacLean was an assistant on New Jersey’s 2003
Stanley Cup championship team and a player on the franchise’s
first title winner in 1995.  
 MacLean also played for the San Jose Sharks, New York
Rangers and Dallas Stars.
