             Some form of credit support for
Spain from the European Commission and International Monetary
Fund is still likely, even after a report of such a plan was
denied yesterday, Royal Bank of Scotland analysts said.  
 Such a plan may become necessary as the government faces
around 25 billion euros in bond redemptions in the next month,
and those may not be easily refinanced given how bond yields
have risen, they wrote. RBS said Spain could receive an IMF
Flexible Credit Line similar to those received by Poland, Mexico
and Colombia.
