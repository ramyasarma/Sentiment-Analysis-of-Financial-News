             OAO RusHydro, a Russian hydropower 
utility, aims to boost its market value to $45 billion by 2015,
Vedomosti reported, citing the company’s development strategy.  
 RusHydro plans partnerships and acquisitions abroad and 
seeks 25 percent of Russia’s energy supply market, the 
newspaper said, citing a copy of the strategy. The utility will
also merge its engineering assets to provide power utility 
construction services aboard, Vedomosti said. Press officials 
at the Moscow-based utility declined to comment to the 
newspaper.
