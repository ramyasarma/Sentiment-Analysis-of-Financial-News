             European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Co. froze its Talarion aerial drone program after Germany and 
France failed to commit funds for the project, Cinco Dias 
reported, without identifying who provided the information.  
 The decision is a setback for Spain as the program could 
have led to the creation of 3,000 jobs in the Mediterranean 
nation, the paper said.
