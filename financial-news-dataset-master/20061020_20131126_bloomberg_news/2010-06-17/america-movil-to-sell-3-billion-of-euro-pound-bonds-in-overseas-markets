             America Movil SAB  is raising $3.1
billion as the largest wireless carrier in Latin America makes
its debut in the euro and pound bond markets.  
 The company is selling 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion) of
seven-year notes yielding 135 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, and 750 million euros of 12-year debt at a
spread of 175 basis points, according to people with knowledge
of the deal. The 650 million pounds ($963 million) of 20-year
bonds will be priced to yield 165 basis points more than the
benchmark gilt.  
 “America Movil is a single-A credit, Latin-America based,
has a billionaire owner and is a utility. Perfect.” said  Suki Mann , head of Societe Generale SA’s credit strategy group in
London. “Perfect also for the sterling market which has been
parched this year so far with supply levels so low.”  
 The Mexico City-based company is controlled by  Carlos Slim ,
the world’s richest person according to Forbes, and is ranked A2
by Moody’s Investors Service, the sixth-highest investment-grade
rating. The company in April posted a 1.9 percent increase in
first-quarter profit to 16.9 billion pesos ($1.35 billion).  
 “It is an interesting deal for European investors seeking
to diversify risk,” said  Ivan Comerma , head of capital markets
at Banc Internacional Banca Mora in Andorra. “The yield is just
correct.”  
 Investors are seeking debt in the U.K. currency after
issuance slumped 75 percent to 18.2 million pounds in the past
six months compared with the same period a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. America Movil last
issued bonds in March when it raised $750 million from five-year
notes, Bloomberg data show.
