             The New York Jets are willing to
offer  Darrelle Revis  the biggest contract ever given to a
defensive back, a deal that could exceed $100 million in value,
Newsday reported.  
 The Jets appear ready to add six years to Revis’s contract,
creating a total package that would approach $100 million or
more, the  newspaper said , citing unnamed people familiar with
the situation.  
 The National Football League team is unwilling to meet
Revis’s demand for an average of $16.2 million a season, which
would exceed the three-year, $45.3 million contract that the
Oakland Raiders gave to cornerback  Nnamdi Asomugha  last year,
the newspaper said.  
 Revis in January was named the runner-up to Green Bay
Packers cornerback  Charles Woodson  in voting for the NFL’s
Defensive Player of the Year Award. Revis, in his third season,
defended 37 passes to lead the NFL, and had six interceptions.  
 On June 14, Revis sat out some plays during the team’s
mini-camp practice in protest of the slow pace of his contract
negotiations. He’s in the fourth year of a six-year contract
that is worth $36 million over its length, according to the NFL
Network.
