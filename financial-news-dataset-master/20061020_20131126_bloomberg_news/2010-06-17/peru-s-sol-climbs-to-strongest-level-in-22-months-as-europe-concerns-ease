             Peru’s sol rose to the strongest
level since August 2008 as Spain’s bond auction allayed concern
about Europe’s debt crisis, fuelling demand for the currency.  
 The sol climbed 0.3 percent to 2.8285 per U.S. dollar at
3:28 p.m. New York time, from 2.8370 yesterday. The sol has
advanced for six straight sessions, the longest winning streak
since the period ending March 5. The currency reached its
strongest level since Aug. 7, 2008.  
 “Demand from foreign investors caused the sol to
appreciate,” said  Frank Babarczy , head of trading at BBVA Banco
Continental. “There’s a little more confidence about the
situation in Europe. If that continues, then there’ll be more
foreign investment in the local currency.”  
 The central bank didn’t  purchase dollars  in the foreign-
exchange market today, it said on its website. The bank last
intervened April 15, when it purchased $91 million at 2.8350
soles per dollar to curb appreciation in the sol.  
 The sol is the most stable currency in the region despite
the central bank raising its reference rate by 25 basis points
for a second consecutive month last week, Banco de Credito del
Peru said in a report yesterday.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.85 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit.
