             The number of Americans seeking
jobless benefits last week unexpectedly rose to a one-month
high, indicating firings are staying elevated even as the U.S.
economy grows.  
 Initial jobless  claims  increased by 12,000 to 472,000 in
the week ended June 12, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected
450,000 claims, according to the median forecast. The number of
people receiving unemployment insurance rose, while those
getting extended benefits dropped.  
 Some companies are trimming payrolls to boost or maintain
profits at the same time overall employment has grown each month
this year. The figures show that bigger job gains needed to spur
consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy,
may be slow in developing, keeping the unemployment rate close
to 10 percent.  
 “The labor market is not improving,” said  Steven Ricchiuto , chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New
York. “If you really are going to have a sustainable recovery,
you need the labor market to improve.”  
 Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates. Today’s report coincides with the week
the government surveys companies for its monthly employment
report.  
 Consumer Prices  
 Separate figures from the Labor Department showed consumer
prices fell in May for a second month. The consumer price index
dropped 0.2 percent, the biggest decrease since December 2008
and reflecting cheaper gasoline.  
 Stock-index futures pared gains after the report. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,110.7 at 8:42 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note dropped to 3.25 percent from 3.26 late yesterday.  
 Economists forecast jobless applications would fall from an
initially reported 456,000 for the prior week, according to the
median of 42 projections in a Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged
from 440,000 to 475,000.  
 States reporting higher initial claims last week said there
were cutbacks in the manufacturing, construction and educational
services industries, a Labor Department spokesman said. Claims
tend to rise following a holiday and seasonal factors
anticipated a smaller gain than what occurred, the spokesman
said.  
 Four-Week Average  
 The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, fell to 463,500 last week from 464,000,
today’s report showed.  
 The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
increased by 88,000 in the week ended June 5 to 4.57 million.
They were forecast to rise to 4.5 million after slumping 234,000
the previous week.  
 The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended or emergency benefits under federal
programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and
are now collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by
about 169,000 to 5.22 million in the week ended May 29.  
 The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, rose to 3.6 percent in
the week ended June 5 from 3.5 percent.  
 States Reporting  
 Thirty-eight states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 15 reported an increase. These data are also
reported with a one-week lag.  
 Claims around 450,000 are consistent with private companies
adding about 100,000 jobs a month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief
economist Bruce Kasman said in a note to clients before today’s
report. That is fewer than the 116,000 a month average growth in
the five years to December 2007, when the recession began.  
 Initial claims would have to average 425,000 to 430,000 for
private payrolls to rise by the 175,000 a month that JPMorgan
economists are forecasting for the second half of the year,
Kasman said.  
 Dot Hill Systems Corp., a Longmont, Colorado-based software
maker, said June 15 it will eliminate about 10 percent of its
global workforce and also cut the annual base salaries of its
vice president and executive management teams by the same
amount. Other employees face a potential 5 percent reduction in
annual base pay.

                          June 16 (Bloomberg) -- Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc., talks with Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton about U.S. manufacturing and housing data for April, and the outlook for the economy and Federal Reserve monetary policy.
     Production in the U.S. rose by the most since August and builders broke ground on fewer homes than projected, showing manufacturing is sustaining the recovery as the housing market retreats following the expiration of a government tax credit.
