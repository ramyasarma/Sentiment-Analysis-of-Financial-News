             Peru plans to double the number of
state companies listed on the Lima  Stock Exchange  to 16 this
year to raise financing for investment projects, said  Jorge Villasante , director of state company financing agency  Fonafe .  
 Peru’s government may “eventually” list all 33 state
companies, including state mining company  Activos Mineros SAC ,
and make a decision “within months” to trade up to a 20
percent stake in the eight companies already listed, Villasante
said today in an interview at the exchange.  
 “State companies face delays with their investment
projects,” Villasante said. “Capital markets have several
options for raising capital, including bond sales.”  
 State companies including state-owned oil company  Petroleos
del Peru SA , known as Petroperu, are seeking cash to help fund
1.9 billion soles ($671.7 million) in investment projects this
year, Villasante said. Fonafe applied today to list shares in
state electricity companies  Electro Sur SA ,  Egesur SA  and Elor
SA.  
 Peru may sell as much as 20 percent of Petroperu in a share
offering before the government’s term expires next year, Finance
Minister  Mercedes Araoz  said June 9 at the Bloomberg Peru
Economic Summit.
