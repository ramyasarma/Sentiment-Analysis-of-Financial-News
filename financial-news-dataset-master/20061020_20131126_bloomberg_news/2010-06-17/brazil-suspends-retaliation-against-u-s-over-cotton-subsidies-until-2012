             Brazil will postpone retaliating
against the U.S. for subsidies paid to cotton farmers after the
countries reached an accord that calls for cutting aid paid to
American farmers, Brazil’s Foreign Trade Chamber said.  
 The World Trade Organization in August ruled that Brazil
may impose sanctions on U.S.  imports  and intellectual property
rights because the cotton subsidies violated global trade rules.
Retaliation will be suspended until at least 2012, the chamber
said in a statement today.  
 The U.S. agreed to a “substantial” cut in subsidies and
to creating a $147.3 million a year fund to support Brazilian
cotton producers as part of the agreement, the statement says.
The accord grants the U.S. until the end of 2012 to enact a new
farm bill capping subsidies to cotton growers.  
 “This is not a final solution, but it lays out elements
that will allow for consultations and reforms to the farm bill
that will take place by the end of 2012,”  Roberto Azevedo ,
Brazil’s ambassador to the WTO, told reporters in Brasilia.  
 Azevedo said Brazil has the right to impose sanctions at
any time should the negotiations become deadlocked.  
 “We are pleased with this decision, and look forward to
signing the framework soon,” Nefeterius McPherson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, said in
an e-mail. “We hope to build upon this positive development to
forge a stronger bilateral trading relationship with Brazil.”
