             Germany “won’t give up” in its
efforts to overcome opposition within the Group of 20 toward
making the financial sector pay for the costs of the financial
crisis, Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter said.  
 Germany will push for a G-20 agreement on a financial
transaction tax, and if it fails to achieve that, a European
Union levy, Kampeter said in a speech in Berlin today.
