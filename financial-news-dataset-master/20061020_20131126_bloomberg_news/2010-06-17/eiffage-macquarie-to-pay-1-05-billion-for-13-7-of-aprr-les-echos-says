             Eiffage SA and Macquarie Group have
agreed to pay 854 million euros to raise their stake in their
APRR toll-road venture to 95 percent from 81.48 percent, Les
Echos reported, citing the buyers.  
 Funds managed by Elliott Management Corporation and Sandell
AM Corp. will sell their stake at a price per share of 55 euros,
according to Les Echos. Eiffage plans to buy out the remaining 5
percent of APRR, the newspaper said.
