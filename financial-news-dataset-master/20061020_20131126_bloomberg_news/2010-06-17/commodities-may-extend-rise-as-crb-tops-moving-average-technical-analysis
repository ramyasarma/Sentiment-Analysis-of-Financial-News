             Commodities may be headed for their
biggest weekly gain since October if a benchmark index closes
above its moving average, sending prices to a six-week high,
said  Mark Schultz  at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC.  
 A close by the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials above today’s 50-day moving average of 263.9 may push
the gauge up another 1.6 percent to 268, Schultz said. That
would mark a 4.7 percent gain for the week and leave the gauge
at the highest level since May 5. Before today, the index jumped
3.2 percent this week, led by coffee, energy products and wheat.  
 “If we can get to a close above the 50-day moving average,
that would bode well for commodities in general,” said Schultz,
a Northstar vice president in Minneapolis. The index may reach
280 by mid-July, the highest since April 26, should the dollar’s
decline continue or adverse weather harm U.S. crops, he said.  
 Demand for energy, metals and crops may increase as U.S.
equities rebound and the dollar declines, Schultz said. As of
yesterday, the CRB jumped 6.8 percent since reaching an eight-
month low on May 25, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  had
rallied 6.6 percent from a six-month low on June 8.  
 “Stocks are up, and that’s helping, and the dollar is
correcting down, so that’s helping,” Schultz said. “Anytime we
get the economic situation stabilized, that’s always better for
commodities demand.”  
 As of yesterday, the  U.S. Dollar Index , which tracks the
greenback against six major currencies, had dropped 3 percent
since a 15-month high June 7 to 86.083. The measure may slide to
82.5 by September, the lowest level since May 4, should it close
below 86 this week, Schultz said.
