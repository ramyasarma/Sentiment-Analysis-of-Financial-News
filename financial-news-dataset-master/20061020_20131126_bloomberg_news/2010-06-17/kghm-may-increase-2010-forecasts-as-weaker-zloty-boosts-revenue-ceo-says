             KGHM Polska Miedz SA , Poland’s only
copper producer, may increase its 2010 forecasts and has shelved
plans for a bond sale, as a weaker zloty helps earnings, Chief
Executive Officer  Herbert Wirth  said.  
 “An upward revision of our 2010 budget at the beginning of
the second half is possible,” Wirth said in an interview
yesterday, adding that higher revenue means the company has
abandoned plans to sell bonds “for now.”  
 KGHM  forecast in February it would increase 2010 net income
to 2.9 billion zloty ($880 million) on sales of 11.7 billion
zloty. The estimates assumed copper would trade at $6,700 a ton
and the zloty’s average exchange rate would be 2.7 per dollar.  
 Copper’s average price on the London Metal Exchange since
the beginning of the year amounted to $7,203 a ton and the
Polish currency averaged 2.9990 per dollar, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 KGHM  stock rose as much as 1.1 percent to 94.6 zloty at
1:07 p.m. in Warsaw, erasing its earlier decline of 1.6 percent.
The benchmark WIG20 Index was little changed.  
 The zloty strengthened to 3.2878 to the dollar and copper
fell 1.5 percent to $6,549 a ton today.  
 In an April interview with the  Rzeczpospolita newspaper 
Wirth forecast that KGHM would start raising funds under a 500
million-zloty domestic bond program that’s already been approved
by the board.  
 “When I said we’d need to sell bonds, the zloty was
stronger,” he said yesterday. ‘Its weakening means that our
revenue is higher than I forecast then” and “for now” the
company “will be able to finance all our investments from our
own capital.”  
 Tauron Sale  
 KGHM, which had planned to invest 3.27 billion zloty this
year, spending 1.63 billion zloty on acquisitions, will now
exceed this amount as it decided to buy a stake in Tauron Polska
Energia SA’s initial public offering that the Polish utility is
holding this month.  
 KGHM may spend 1.11 billion zloty for Tauron if it receives
the entire 11.3 percent stake for which it subscribed in the
book building of the country’s second-largest power group.  
 The final budgeted amount of 1.63 billion zloty for
acquisitions, which excludes the Tauron investment, may be lower
due to “all kinds of savings” and the delay until future years
of some planned costs of the Canadian copper deposit KGHM is
buying, Wirth said.  
 Afton Ajax, the 50,000 ton-a-year Canadian deposit that
KGHM is buying from  Abacus Mining & Exploration Corp.,  is the
company’s first acquisition outside Poland since 1996. The
copper producer plans to buy more deposits abroad as it seeks to
raise output 40 percent to 700,000 tons a year.  
 “I don’t rule out that we’ll announce a preliminary
agreement on a second Canadian deposit sometime this year,”
Wirth said. “Our goal is to add 200,000 tons a year” to
production and “I’d prefer that the next project was
significantly bigger than Afton Ajax.”
