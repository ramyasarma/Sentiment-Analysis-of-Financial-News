             Dhofar International Development and
Investment Holding Co. , an investor in banks, ports and power
stations in Oman, is among five companies that will gain entry
to the country’s benchmark index from July 1, the bourse said.  
 Financial Services Co.,   Global Financial Investment ,  Gulf
Investment Services  Co. and National Aluminum Production will be
joining Dhofar. Al Maha Petroleum Products Marketing Co.,  Port
Services Corp. SAOG ,  United Finance Co.,   Transgulf Investment
Holding Co.,  and  Construction Materials IND  will leave the
index, the stock exchange said today.  
 Dhofar surged as much as 10 percent today and closed 8
percent higher at 0.426 rial. National Aluminum gained 3.8
percent, the most this month.  
 “I expect Dhofar to have a weight of around two to three
percent in the index starting July 1,” said  Joice Mathew ,
senior manager of research at United Securities Oman. “Indexed
fund and portfolio managers would try to adjust their portfolio
holdings accordingly, and this could be the major reason why we
saw an upward surge in these stocks.”  
 The selection is based on liquidity, market value and
earnings per share, the exchange said.
