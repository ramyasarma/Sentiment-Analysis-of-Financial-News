             Wheat declined on speculation that a
rally to one-month high and a stronger dollar may erode demand
for U.S. supplies. Soybeans also dropped after touching a one-
week high.  
 Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade lost 0.5
percent after yesterday touching the highest level for the most-
active contract since May 13 as wet weather disrupted field work
in the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains. Soybeans fell 0.5 percent
after climbing to the highest level since June 8.  
 “It’s just a technical correction against recent gains,”
 Takaki Shigemoto , an analyst at research and investment company
JSC Corp., said today.  
 Wheat for September delivery fell as much as 2.25 cents to
$4.7425 a bushel, and traded at $4.7475 at 2:15 p.m. Singapore
time. Before today, futures had gained 11 percent in the past
five days.  
 The grain rose 2 percent yesterday, supported by Canadian
wet-weather concerns, harvest delays in parts of the U.S. and
news that Saudi Arabia is in the market for nearly 1 million
tons of high-protein wheat,  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist
at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a daily note today.  
 The rain may also delay soybean planting that the U.S.
government said was 91 percent  complete  on June 13. Winter-wheat
harvesting was 9 percent finished, less than the five-year
average of 12 percent for this time of year, the data show.  
 Wet Weather  
 The Canadian Wheat Board has said that as many as 12.5
million acres (5 million hectares) normally planted with spring
crops would be unseeded because of wet weather. Wheat planting
in Western Canada, the biggest growing area, will be 19.15
million acres, the lowest since 1971, the board said.  
 Soybeans for November delivery dropped 3.75 cents to $9.205
a bushel in Chicago after reaching $9.2825 earlier, the highest
level for a most-active contract since June 8.  
 Canola for November delivery fell 1.2 percent to C$422
($411) a ton on the ICE Futures Canada exchange today after
touching C$427.70, the highest level since August 31. The
contract yesterday gained for the eighth straight day, the
longest winning streak since Jan. 6.  
 The euro fell as much as 0.4 percent, weakening for a
second day versus the dollar.  
 Corn for December delivery in Chicago was little changed at
$3.7775 a bushel, after touching $3.815 yesterday, the highest
level since May 12.  
 China, the world’s second-largest corn consumer, may buy
more than 1 million metric tons in the next 18 months, in
addition to purchases made this year, as economic growth boosts
demand, U.S. Grains Council President  Thomas Dorr  said in a
phone interview from Washington yesterday.  
 The Asian nation has purchased at least 715,000 tons of
corn for delivery by Aug. 31, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data. China, a corn exporter until last year, had
not bought any U.S. corn in the 15 months through April 29, when
the USDA announced its first purchase of 115,000 tons for
delivery this year, according to the agency’s data.
