             The  U.S. Supreme Court , putting
limits on the privacy rights of government workers, ruled that a
California police department acted reasonably when it reviewed
personal text messages on an officer’s government-issued pager.  
 The justices today unanimously rejected arguments by Jeff
Quon, a SWAT team member, that the city of Ontario violated his
constitutional rights.  
 The city obtained a transcript of Quon’s messages during an
investigation to determine whether officers were using their
pagers for personal messages. The transcripts showed that Quon
had been exchanging sexually explicit messages with his wife,
his girlfriend and another SWAT team member.  
 Quon argued unsuccessfully that the department had
implicitly allowed personal use of the pagers. He pointed to the
department’s informal policy of having officers pay out of their
own pockets when they exceeded the 25,000 monthly character
limit.  
 The case is Ontario v. Quon, 08-1332.
