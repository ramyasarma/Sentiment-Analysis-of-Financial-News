             Copper fell the most in almost two
weeks after reports signaled an uneven economic rebound in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  
 Manufacturing in eastern Pennsylvania, southern  New Jersey 
and Delaware expanded in June at a slower rate than forecast, an
economic index showed today. The number of Americans seeking
jobless benefits last week unexpectedly rose to a one-month
high, according to Labor Department figures.  
 “Copper just ran out of gas here in this atmosphere of the
uncertainties of the growth pattern,” said  Donald Selkin , the
chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in  New
York .  
 Copper futures for September delivery slid 8.95 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.924 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest
loss for a most-active contract since June 4.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index dropped to 8, a 10-month low, from 21.4 in May. Economists
forecast the measure would fall to 20, according to the median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings above zero
signal growth.  
 Copper for delivery in three months dropped $204, or 3.1
percent, to $6,446 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange,
also the biggest one-day loss since June 4.  
 Nickel, aluminum, tin and zinc prices also fell on the
LME. Lead rose for the fourth straight day.
