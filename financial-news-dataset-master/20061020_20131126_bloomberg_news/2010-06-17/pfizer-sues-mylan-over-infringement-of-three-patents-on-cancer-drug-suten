             Pfizer Inc. , the world’s largest
drugmaker, alleged that Mylan Inc., the biggest U.S. generic
pharmaceuticals maker, infringed three patents for Sutent, a
drug used to treat cancerous tumors of the digestive tract and
kidneys.  
 Pfizer’s lawsuit contends Mylan violated its patent rights
by filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market copies of Sutent before the patents
expire, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 “Sutent has annual sales of about $1 billion” and
“Pfizer will suffer irreparable injury” unless the
infringement is stopped, the company’s lawyers said in court
papers.  
 In April, New York-based Pfizer said it halted a study of
Sutent as a treatment for advanced liver cancer after observing
complications in test patients. The company said it will
continue studying Sutent’s use to fight other types of cancer.  
 Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, reported  sales  of
$5.09 billion last year.  
 Michael Laffin , a spokesman for Mylan, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  
 Pfizer shares fell 20 cents to $15.28 at 12:24 p.m. New
York time.  
 The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Mylan Inc., 10CV528, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
