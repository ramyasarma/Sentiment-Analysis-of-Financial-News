             The U.S. State Department has issued
a travel alert to Americans planning to go to Toronto next week,
warning of potential demonstrations and increased security
during the Group of 20 summit.  
 The Canadian government will also likely increase passport
and security checks at its border ahead of the summit, according
to the  advisory .  
 “U.S. citizens should avoid traveling in or through
downtown Toronto during the Summit,” according to the advisory.
“ Demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can become
violent and unpredictable.”  
 The fourth G-20 summit is a gathering of the heads of state
of the biggest developed and emerging economies that oversee
about 85 percent of global output. Past G-20 meetings, including
one in Pittsburgh in September and another in London in April
2009, drew thousands of protesters.  
 In London, leaders from 22 countries, more than a thousand
government officials and aides, and several hundred members of
the press clogged the streets. Among the demonstrations was one
outside the Bank of England that left one person dead.
