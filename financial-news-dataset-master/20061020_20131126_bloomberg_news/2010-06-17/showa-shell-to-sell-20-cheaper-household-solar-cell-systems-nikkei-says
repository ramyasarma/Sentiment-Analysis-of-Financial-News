             Showa Shell Sekiyu KK will roll out
a residential solar power-generation system priced about 20
percent less than competing products from Japanese competitors,
Nikkei English News reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 The 2.4 kilowatt systems will be offered by Showa Shell’s
Solar Frontier unit for about 1.15 million yen ($12,660)
including installation, Nikkei reported. Competitors generally
sell 3 kilowatt to 4 kilowatt systems for about 600,000 yen per
kilowatt, Nikkei said.
