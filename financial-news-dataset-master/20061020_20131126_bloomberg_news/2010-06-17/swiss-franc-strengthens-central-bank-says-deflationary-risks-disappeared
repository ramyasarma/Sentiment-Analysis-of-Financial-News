             The Swiss franc strengthened against
the euro after the nation’s central bank said deflationary risks
have “largely disappeared.”  
 The franc appreciated 0.8 percent to 1.3814 as of 8:35 a.m.
in London.  
 The Swiss National Bank will act as needed if gains in the
franc threatened deflation, the SNB said after its quarterly
meeting in Geneva today.
