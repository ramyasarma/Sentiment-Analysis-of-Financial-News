             AstraZeneca Plc  said it’s
“evaluating its options,” including lawsuits, after a Canadian
court ruling paved the way for approval of Apotex Inc.’s generic
copy of the Nexium ulcer medicine.  
 The Federal Court of Canada dismissed the U.K. drugmaker’s
request to stop the health ministry approving the Apotex
medicine, London-based AstraZeneca said today in a statement.
AstraZeneca said its options include a “comprehensive patent
infringement action.”  
 Canada’s regulator can approve copies of the medicine before
the expiration of Nexium’s patents, but drugs introduced before
this would be subject to patent lawsuits, according to
AstraZeneca. The patents that protect Nexium in Canada expire
between 2013 and 2019, the company said. The court ruling
relates to only one of the patents, AstraZeneca said.  
 Nexium generated $217 million in sales in Canada last year.
AstraZeneca said it does not expect to alter its full-year
earnings per share forecast, even if generic drugmakers
introduce Nexium copies.
