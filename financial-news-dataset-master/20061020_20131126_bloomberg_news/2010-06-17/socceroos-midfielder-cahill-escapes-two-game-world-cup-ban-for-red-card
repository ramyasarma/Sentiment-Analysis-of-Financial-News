             Australia midfielder Tim Cahill 
received a one-game ban for his red card in the Socceroos’ 4-0
loss to Germany in their opening World Cup match four days ago.  
 Cahill, who’s scored 20 goals in 41 games for Australia,
will miss the June 19 Group D match against Ghana before being
available against Serbia on June 23, Football Federation
Australia said in an e-mailed statement.  
 A FIFA disciplinary committee today ruled that Cahill
should get the minimum one-match suspension after being given a
straight red card for his tackle on Germany’s  Bastian Schweinsteiger  in Durban.  
 “The committee could have decided to impose a longer
suspension and we are glad that they did not deem the tackle
serious enough to warrant anything further,” John Boultbee, the
FFA’s head of national teams, said in the statement.
