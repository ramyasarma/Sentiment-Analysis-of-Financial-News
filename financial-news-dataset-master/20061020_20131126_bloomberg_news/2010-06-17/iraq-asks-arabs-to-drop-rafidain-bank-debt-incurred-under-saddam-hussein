             Iraq, carrying a $40 billion debt
burden from the  Saddam Hussein  era, will ask Arab institutions
to forgive some of the unpaid interest owed by Rafidain Bank so
as to regain the rest, government spokesman  Ali Al-Dabbagh  said.  
 Arab companies and organizations will be asked to forego at
least 50 percent of unpaid interest accrued from deposits in
foreign currencies blocked at Iraqi state-owned Rafidain Bank
since the early 1990s, he said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Iraq will repay them the remaining interest piled up since
deposits were frozen under the Saddam Hussein regime, he said.  
 The Council of Ministers asked the finance ministry to
negotiate a solution with the Arab institutions, who could
otherwise demand the entire amount of unpaid interest as grounds
for legal action that may lead to the freezing of Rafidain Bank
assets abroad, he said.  
 The institutions had declined an Iraqi government proposal
for them to forgive most of the unpaid interest and to accept
being paid between 10 percent and 30 percent of the total
amount, he said.  
 Iraq has thus decided to raise the proposal to 50 percent,
particularly after some Arab institutions filed and won lawsuits
against Rafidain Bank, he said.  
 The Arab country is struggling to settle debts accrued
since the first Gulf War and has set aside 5 percent of its oil
revenue to pay it.  
 Iraq may hold the world’s third-largest oil reserves,
although sectarian violence and political conflicts have
hampered economic revival since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003
that ousted Hussein’s regime.
