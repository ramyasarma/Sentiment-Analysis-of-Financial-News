             Japanese and Australian  stocks  fell
in New York as a slump in Philadelphia manufacturing and rising
jobless claims in the U.S. overshadowed gains in the euro.  
 American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , which
counts North America as its biggest market by revenue, finished
0.3 percent lower than the Tokyo close. Those of  Sony Corp. ,
which gets 21 percent of its sales from Europe, gained 0.2
percent as a stronger euro against the yen increases the value
of its sales in the region. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s biggest mining company, sank 0.5 percent after prices
for metals and oil dropped yesterday.  
 The Bank of New York Mellon Asia  ADR Price Index , which
tracks American depositary receipts of the region’s companies,
slid 0.8 percent yesterday.  
 “The economic climate has to further improve in countries
like the U.S. for the stock market to enter a full-fledged
recovery phase, though investors are less anxious about
Europe,” said Kazuhiro Takahashi, a general manager at Tokyo-
based Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  
 Yen-denominated futures  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 10,030 in Chicago yesterday, 0.2
percent higher than 10,010 in Osaka. They were  bid  in the pre-
market at 10,030 as of 8:04 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 9,999.40 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 0.2 percent.
New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  was little changed.  
 S&P Futures  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  advanced 0.1 percent yesterday,
increasing for a sixth day in the longest winning streak since
the 11 days ended July 2009. The gauge is en route to a 3
percent climb this week, the steepest weekly advance since
January, as improved sentiment among American consumers and
growth in New York manufacturing boosted expectations demand for
Asian-made goods in the U.S. will increase.  
 The advances have lifted the average price of shares in the
gauge to 14.8 times estimated earnings, compared with a 17-month
low of 13.8 times on May 18.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dipped 0.1
percent. The gauge was down most of the day in New York
yesterday before gains in the euro drove the index to close with
a 0.1 percent gain.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its general
economic index slumped in June, a 10-month low and below
economists’ estimates. Initial jobless claims increased to
472,000 in the week ended June 12, exceeding the 450,000
projected by economists, according to a Labor Department report.  
 HSBC Holdings  
 The euro appreciated versus the yen to as much as 112.79
today from 112.09 at the 3 p.m. close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday as increased demand for Spain’s bonds raised
confidence in the common currency. Spain sold 3.5 billion euros
($4.3 billion) of 10-year and 30-year bonds, the maximum set for
the auction, as a decline in prices enticed buyers.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, may raise as much
as $10 billion by selling new shares in Shanghai next year,
Andrew Lim, an analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital LLP, wrote in
an e-mailed note to investors yesterday. The increase in capital
would boost the bank’s core tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial
strength, to 7.3 percent at the end of 2012, which is “more in
line with its peers,” he said.
