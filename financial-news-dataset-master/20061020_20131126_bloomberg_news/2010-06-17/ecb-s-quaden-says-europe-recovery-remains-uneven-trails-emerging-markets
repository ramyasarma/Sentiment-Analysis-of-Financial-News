             European Central Bank Governing
Council member Guy Quaden said the region’s economic recovery is
“quite uneven” and governments need to strengthen their fiscal
discipline.  
 “This upturn remains quite uneven, as Europe is clearly
lagging behind the U.S. and is even further behind many emerging
economies in Asia and South America,” Quaden said in the
foreword to a report on financial stability published today by
Belgium’s central bank. “The mounting doubts over public debt
sustainability in some EU countries have created severe tension
in the euro area,” he said.  
 “The speed at which these stresses have emerged has shown
that authorities need to act promptly, decisively and in a
coordinated manner if they do not want to be systematically
outrun by the markets,” said Quaden, who also is head of the
Belgian central bank. “In the euro area, in particular, fiscal
discipline needs to be strengthened, and structural reforms must
be accelerated.”
