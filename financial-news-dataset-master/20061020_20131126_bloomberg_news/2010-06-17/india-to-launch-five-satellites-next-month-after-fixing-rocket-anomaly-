             India plans to put five remote-
sensing satellites into orbit in the first half of next month
after fixing a rocket “anomaly” that forced it to delay
launches in May.  
 The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle will carry India’s
Cartosat-2B, Algeria’s ALSAT-2A and two small satellites from
the University of Toronto, P.S. Veeraraghavan, director of
 Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre , said by phone today from the
southern city of Thiruvananthapuram. The fifth unit will be a
one-kilogram satellite built by Indian students, he said.  
 The agency, based in Thiruvananthapuram, has corrected the
anomaly, which was in the second stage of the rocket,
Veeraraghavan said. The delay had disrupted India’s challenge to
China, Japan, and South Korea as it competes for commercial-
satellite launches.  
 In April, India also failed in its bid to join a group of
five nations using their own rocket technology to launch large
satellites into higher orbits when scientists lost control of
the 50-meter (164 feet) GSLV-D3 spacecraft minutes after
blastoff.  
 “The reasons for the failure are still being analyzed and
we expect a report in a month’s time,” Veeraraghavan said.  
 India is planning a $2.5 billion unmanned mission to space
by 2015 and is slated to launch a second unmanned moon craft
Chandrayaan II at a cost of $87.5 million before March 2013.  
 The Asian nation launched its  first space rocket  in 1963
and its first satellite in 1975. The country’s satellite program
consists of 21 orbiters, of which 11 are currently in service.
