             China’s  health-care stocks  fell the
most since November on concern the shares are overvalued given
their earnings growth prospects.  
 Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., which makes penicillin,
slid 7.9 percent to 20.45 yuan at 2:20 p.m. in Shanghai,
narrowing gains for the past 12 months to 47 percent. The
health-care index lost 4.8 percent, trimming this year’s gains
to 4 percent. It slid the most among the 10 industry groups in
the CSI 300 Index.  
 Liu Xiaoming , an analyst at Guoyuan Securities Co., said
investors were selling drugmakers after recent rallies pushed
reported price earnings for the industry measure to 25 times
compared with 18 for the CSI 300 Index.  
 Orient Securities Co. analyst  Li Shuhua  said reports from
the Xinhua News Agency and Shanghai Daily that the deputy
director of China’s State Food and Drug Administration is under
investigation for suspected disciplinary violations were also
spurring sales.  
 “The bad news is like a catalyst,” Li said.
“Institutions had felt the value was too high even before so
they are selling now.”
