             The monster of Loch Ness has yet to
make it to the opera stage. So we’ll have to content ourselves
with Loch Katrine, another lake in Scotland and the setting of
Rossini’s “La Donna del Lago.”  
 The staging at the  Palais Garnier , a coproduction with
 Covent Garden  and  La Scala , is the first in Paris since 1824,
five years after the world premiere in Naples.  
 One reason for the neglect is the superhuman demands on two
of the heroine’s suitors, roles written for tenors with an
extremely high top register and capable of singing coloratura.
(Malcolm, the third contender, is sung by a mezzo-soprano.)  
 Another reason may be the less-than-perfect libretto that
is almost a travesty of its source, Walter Scott’s epic poem
“The Lady of the Lake.”  
 It tells the story of Ellen (Elena in the opera), the
daughter of the outlawed Lord Douglas, whom her father wants to
marry the rebel leader Roderick (Rodrigo) Dhu. Yet her heart
belongs to Malcolm, a young Highlander. She is also courted by
James Fitz-James (Uberto), a mysterious huntsman whom she once
rowed across the lake.  
 After various adventures, all ends well. Roderick is killed
in a duel, and the huntsman turns out to be none other than King
James V, who graciously unites Ellen with the man she loves.  
 Elena’s Joy  
 It can’t hold a candle to Donizetti’s “Lucia di
Lammermoor,” another romantic opera inspired by Scott. Much of
Rossini’s music, though always agreeable on the ear, sounds as
if it was written on autopilot.  
 The two exceptions are Malcolm’s brilliant cavatina in Act
I and “Tanti affetti in tal momento,” Elena’s joyous outburst
in the finale. With its many ensembles and choruses, “La Donna
del Lago” clearly anticipates Rossini’s last stage work
“Guillaume Tell,” another opera set in the mountains.  
 Absurdly, director Lluis Pasqual and set designer Ezio
Frigerio play down the bucolic element. The stage is dominated
by Stirling Castle, the residence of the kings of Scotland,
which is supposed to appear only in the finale. At times, the
set opens up for a glimpse of landscape.  
 The lake is nowhere to be seen. Nor is there any kilt in
sight: The hunters, clansmen and shepherds appear impeccably
dressed in tails, like singers in an oratorio.  
 The acting is conventional: Swords are drawn, men and women
fall to their knees or spread their arms in despair. You may
argue that it doesn’t matter how Rossini’s silly cloak-and-sword
saga is staged; what counts is the singing. This much is
certain: The two stars deliver the goods.  
 Finale Fireworks  
 Joyce DiDonato  is an ebullient Elena, tossing off the
fireworks of her rondo finale with breathtaking ease.  Juan Diego Florez’s  Uberto confirms his reputation as today’s leading
expert in this kind of vocal mountaineering.  
 Colin Lee  as his rival Rodrigo is also capable of
astonishing top notes, yet his pitch control leaves room for
improvement. Daniela Barcellona does a creditable job in the
trouser role of Malcolm. Simon Orfila is a powerful, though
rough, Douglas.  
 While Roberto Abbado, the conductor, emphasizes the lyrical
side of the score, he is often too slow.  
 Rating: **.  
 “La Donna del Lago” is in repertory through July 10. The
production is sponsored by Colas SA, a unit of Bouygues SA.
