             HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman Stephen
Green wants the bank’s shares to be traded in Shanghai next
year, he told Le Figaro in an interview.  
 There’s little chance of a Shanghai listing this year, he
was cited as saying.  
 Green told the newspaper that prospects for the Chinese
economy are “excellent” and that he has no concerns about the
functioning of the Chinese banking system.  
 More time is needed before the application of new Basel 3
capital requirements, Green told Le Figaro. If applied as they
stand, the new proposals would mean that banks would need “much
too much” refinancing, he was cited as saying.
