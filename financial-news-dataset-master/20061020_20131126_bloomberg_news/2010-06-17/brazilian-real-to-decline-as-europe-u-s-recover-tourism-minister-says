             Brazil’s real is likely to decline
against other currencies as the U.S. and European economies
recover, Tourism Minister  Luiz Barretto  said today.  
 “The economic recovery of the U.S. and a significant part
of Europe will mean the depreciation of the real,” Barretto
said in an interview in London. “It won’t fall to the level it
was at 10 years ago, but at least to 2 reais to the dollar.”
