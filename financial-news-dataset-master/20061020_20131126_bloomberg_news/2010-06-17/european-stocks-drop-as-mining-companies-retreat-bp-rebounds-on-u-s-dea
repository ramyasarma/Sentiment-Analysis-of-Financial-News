             European stocks dropped as declines
by basic resources companies offset a rally in BP Plc shares.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.3 percent to
253.82 at 8:09 a.m. in London, snapping six days of gains. BP
jumped 6.5 percent to 359 pence. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, fell 0.6 percent to 1,918 pence.
