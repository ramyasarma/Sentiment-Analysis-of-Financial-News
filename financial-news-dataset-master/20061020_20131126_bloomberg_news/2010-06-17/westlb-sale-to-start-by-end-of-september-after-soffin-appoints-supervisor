             Germany’s Soffin bank rescue fund
said the sale of state-owned lender  WestLB AG  will start by
Sept. 30 at the latest after it appointed  Friedrich Merz  to
oversee the process.  
 Merz, a lawyer and former lawmaker and member of the
European Parliament, has business experience and is politically
connected in Berlin and Brussels, Soffin said in an e-mailed
statement today. Dusseldorf-based WestLB, the bank’s owners and
government authority responsible for financial market stability
agreed to name an official to oversee the sale.  
 Germany’s bank-rescue fund agreed last year to provide
WestLB with 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in capital to help
the lender restructure, improving its chances of finding a
buyer. The bank was ordered to reduce its assets, shed risky
businesses and sell itself by the end of 2011 under conditions
imposed by the European Commission for approving the state aid.  
 WestLB has a “clearly defined business model” after
splitting off 77 billion euros of non-core assets into a
separate unit, Soffin said.
