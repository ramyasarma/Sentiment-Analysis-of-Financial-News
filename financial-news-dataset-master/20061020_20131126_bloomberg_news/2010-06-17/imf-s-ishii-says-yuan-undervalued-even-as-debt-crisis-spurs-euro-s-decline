             Chinese policy makers should pursue
a more flexible currency regime even as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis bolsters the value of the yuan, an International Monetary
Fund official said.  
 “China’s yuan is still undervalued” from what the fund
considers equilibrium value,  Shogo Ishii , director of the IMF’s
Asia-Pacific office, said in an interview in Tokyo today. As for
its appreciation, “the sooner it happens, the less of a
distortion it will be on the global economy,” he said.  
 Scrutiny of Europe’s debt woes has spurred a 17 percent
gain in the yuan against the euro this year. The government has
held the currency around 6.83 per dollar since July 2008 to
support its exporters amid the global financial crisis.  
 Policy makers haven’t relaxed their calls for a stronger
Chinese currency. As recently as last week, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said China’s exchange-rate policy
prevents a balanced global recovery and urged a stronger yuan to
help contain inflation in the world’s third-largest economy.  
 “Rebalancing is necessary for countries that have large
current-account surpluses,” Ishii said. “A stronger yuan would
result in increasing the real value of the household sector,
such as income and savings, which would stimulate consumer
spending.”  
 China’s  exports  jumped the most in six years in May and
property prices rose at a near-record pace, signs that the
economy is withstanding the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
remains at risk of overheating.  
 Shipments to the European Union rose 50 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 29 percent in April, a government report
showed last week. China’s pegging of the yuan will make exports
to that region less competitive than those of rivals including
South Korea.  
 Ishii has been with the Washington-based fund since 1981,
where he has worked in the monetary and exchange affairs
department. Ishii was appointed as director of the IMF’s Tokyo-
based regional office for the Asia Pacific in February.
