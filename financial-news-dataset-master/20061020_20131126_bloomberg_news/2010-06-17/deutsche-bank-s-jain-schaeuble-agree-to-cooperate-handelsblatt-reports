             Deutsche Bank AG’s  Anshu Jain  and
Germany’s Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  agreed at a
confidential meeting this week to intensify cooperation between
the country’s biggest bank and the government,  Handelsblatt 
said, citing people familiar with the matter.

for after being named the sole head of Deutsche Bank’s corporate
and investment bank two days ago, according to the newspaper.  
 The talks included the bank’s role in selling government
bonds, corporate finance, and taking state-owned companies
public, the newspaper said.
