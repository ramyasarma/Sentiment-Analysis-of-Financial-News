             Canadian wholesale  sales 
unexpectedly fell in April, led by lower sales of motor
vehicles, government figures show.  
 Sales  dropped  0.3 percent to C$44 billion ($43 billion),
the second drop in three months, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists expected a 0.3 percent increase, based on the
median of 13 responses in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, who raised his policy
interest rate on June 1 to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25
percent, said yesterday future moves to increase interest rates
aren’t “preordained” because of an uneven global recovery.  
 Canada’s economy  expanded  at a 6.1 percent annual pace last
quarter, and the central bank predicts inflation will exceed its
2 percent target over the next year.  
 The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the effect of
price changes, rose 0.4 percent during the month, Statistics
Canada said.  
 Four of seven  wholesale categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada recorded declines in April. Sales of cars and parts fell
2.5 percent and building material and supplies receipts fell 0.3
percent, the report said. Sales of “miscellaneous” goods like
recyclable materials and chemicals not used for farming dropped
1 percent.  
 Machinery, equipment and supplies sales increased 0.1
percent to C$9 billion, Statistics Canada said.  
 Wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent to C$51.3 billion,
and the ratio of inventories-to-sales advanced to 1.17 in April
from 1.16 in March.  
 Statistics Canada also lowered its estimate of March’s
sales gain to 1.2 percent from the originally reported 1.4
percent. April wholesale sales were 9.7 percent higher than the
same month a year earlier, the agency said.
