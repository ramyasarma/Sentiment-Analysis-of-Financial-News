             Arnold Schwarzenegger ends his
seven-year run as California’s governor with a 23 percent
approval rating and a $19.1 billion budget deficit.  
 When the former action-movie hero heads out of Sacramento
in January for good, he can take some solace from the fact that
he orchestrated an effective alliance with business leaders to
push through a ballot initiative that just might change the way
the state is governed, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its
June 21 issue.  
 Californians voted on June 8 to approve Proposition 14, a
measure that will replace primaries with wide-open elections by
2011. Schwarzenegger’s political action committee, plus some
prominent California executives, raised $4.6 million to promote
the referendum, according to the California Secretary of State’s
website.  
 What united most of them was a distaste for the vintage
California brand of partisan politics that ultimately doomed the
governor’s efforts to cap government spending, something that
might have averted the state’s fiscal crisis.  
 “It makes me sick, this state is so dysfunctional,” said
Los Angeles real estate developer Brian Harvey. He contributed
$100,000 to support the measure, the Secretary of State’s
website shows. “I think this will attract more moderate
candidates.”  
 Other backers such as Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Reed Hastings ($257,000), Hewlett-Packard Co. ($100,000), and
the California Chamber of Commerce ($720,000) hope the new
system, in which the top two candidates chosen by all registered
voters would face off in general elections, will bring more
moderation to California politics.  
 ‘Lifelong Democrat’  
 “I’m a lifelong Democrat, but I’m a centrist,” said Los
Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad, who gave $100,000 to the
Prop 14 cause. “Because of labor interests on the left and
anti-tax folks on the extreme right, nothing gets done.”  
 Adam Mendelsohn, the Republican consultant tapped by the
governor to run the ballot initiative campaign, said he had
anticipated spending as much as $15 million to win. Instead, he
supervised a low-key push with radio ads asking voters if they
were happy with the status quo.  
 Proposition 14 had been denounced by labor groups and the
state’s six recognized political parties, some of which may
mount a legal challenge.  
 “The whole purpose of this is so the Chamber of Commerce
can try to get business-friendly Democrats elected, who don’t
support global warming, environmental legislation, or labor
protection bills,” said John Burton, head of the state’s
Democratic Party. “This isn’t going to change anything.”  
 Schwarzenegger’s political action committee also financed
and won a 2008 anti-gerrymandering referendum that took the
authority to determine the boundaries of electoral districts
away from the legislature and put it in the hands of an
independent committee. Together the two measures represent a
shot at a legacy for a governor who runs a state that has the
lowest credit rating of any in the U.S.
