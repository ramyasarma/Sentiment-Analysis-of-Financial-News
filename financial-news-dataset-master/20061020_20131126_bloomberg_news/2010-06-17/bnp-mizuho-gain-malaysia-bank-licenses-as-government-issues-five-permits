             Malaysia granted five commercial
banking licenses to foreign lenders as part of efforts to open
up its financial industry and attract investments.  
 BNP Paribas SA ,  Mizuho Corporate Bank ,  National Bank of Abu
Dhabi ,  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  and Indonesia’s  PT Bank
Mandiri  will be issued with licenses, Malaysia’s central bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. It earlier granted permits
to Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and a group of
Indian lenders.  
 Prime Minister  Najib Razak , who took office in April last
year, has eased investment rules to help spur expansion in
Southeast Asia’s third-largest  economy . The country needs to
achieve average annual growth of 6 percent during the next five
years to become a high-income nation by 2020, the government
said on June 10.  
 “The new commercial banks are expected to add to the
diversity of the financial services industry, support the new
areas of growth, including green technology, and facilitate the
transformation of the Malaysian economy towards achieving high
value-added and high-income economy status,” Bank Negara
Malaysia said in today’s statement.
