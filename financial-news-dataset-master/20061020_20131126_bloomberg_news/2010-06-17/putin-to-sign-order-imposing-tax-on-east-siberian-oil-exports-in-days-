             Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin will sign an order imposing a discounted export
duty on oil pumped at now-exempt eastern Siberian fields “in
days,” his spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  said.  
 The government approved the discounted rate of 45 percent
at a meeting yesterday for east Siberian oil starting when crude
prices are above $50 a barrel, a higher benchmark than for
standard fields, Peskov said by telephone today. Oil
producers will pay the full export duty when the internal rate
of return for a project reaches 15 percent, he said.  
 “We plan to have this all come into effect from July 1,”
Peskov said.  
 Russia’s budget may gain 353.2 billion rubles ($11.3
billion) through the end of 2012 by imposing the export tax on
eastern Siberian fields from next month, Deputy Prime Minister
 Igor Sechin  said yesterday.  
 The government is seeking to narrow a budget gap to 5.4
percent of gross domestic product this year. Oil producers,
including state-run OAO Rosneft, where Sechin is chairman, say
the development of new deposits depends on tax breaks.
