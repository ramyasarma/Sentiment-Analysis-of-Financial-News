             Japanese  stocks  slid for the first
time in six days after FedEx Corp. projected lower-than-
estimated earnings and a U.S. government report showed housing
starts dropped.  
 Sony Corp. , an electronics maker that gets 21 percent of
its sales in the U.S., dropped 2.8 percent. Panasonic Corp., the
world’s largest maker of plasma televisions, declined 2.6
percent. Companies reliant on overseas demand fell as the yen
strengthened against the euro and dollar. Hirose Electric Co.
and Nissha Printing Co., which make components for mobile phones,
declined after Finland-based Nokia Oyj cut its sales forecast.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  declined 0.7 percent to close
at 9,999.40 in Tokyo. The broader  Topix index  fell 0.6 percent
to 887.48, with almost twice as many shares sinking as rising.
The gauges broke five-day winning streaks.  
 “People are nervous,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in
Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages the
equivalent of $307 billion. “Investors can’t be bullish enough
to bet on improvements in the global economy and to buy risk
assets.”  
 The Topix jumped 1.5 percent yesterday to the highest close
since May 20 as growth in New York manufacturing and gains in
U.S. chip shares boosted optimism corporate earnings will
increase. The gauge has fallen 11 percent from a 52-week high on
April 15 as swelling government deficits prompted Standard &
Poor’s to cut credit ratings on Spain, Portugal and Greece.  
 The slump has driven down the average price of shares in
the gauge to 17.1 times  estimated earnings , near the lowest
level since December 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  futures dropped 0.4 percent.
The gauge fluctuated in New York yesterday before finishing down
0.1 percent after a Commerce Department report showed housing
starts fell 10 percent in May, the biggest decline since March
2009. FedEx, the world’s largest air-cargo carrier, tumbled 6
percent after saying earnings will be $4.40 to $5 a share for
the year that began June 1, trailing the $5.07 estimated by
analysts.
