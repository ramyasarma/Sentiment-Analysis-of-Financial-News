             Ethiopia’s annual inflation rate
increased to 7.4 percent in May, led by non-food costs, the
Central Statistical Agency said.  
 Annual inflation accelerated from 6.8 percent in April, the
Addis Ababa-based agency said today on its website.  
 Non-food prices increased 19.8 percent from a year earlier,
while food inflation, the largest component of the index, rose
by 0.1 percent, it said.
