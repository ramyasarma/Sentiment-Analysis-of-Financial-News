             Eiffage SA  rose the most in more
than three years in Paris trading after a unit it jointly
controls said it’s buying out minority shareholders of a French
toll-road operator, shoring up the unit’s finances.  
 Eiffage shares rose as much as 14 percent to 41.25 euros in
the biggest  intraday  gain since March 2007, and were up 12
percent at 40.41 euros as of 12:51 p.m. in Paris. The highway
operator, Societe des Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhone SA, or APRR,
rose 7.7 percent to 54.78 euros.  
 Eiffage and Sydney-based Macquarie Atlas Roads Group said
in separate statements that Eiffarie, the joint venture they own
with Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund LP, will buy 13.7
percent of APRR for 854 million euros ($1.06 billion), or 55
euros a share, adding to its 81.5 percent holding.  
 This is “a highly accretive transaction” for Eiffage,
said Natixis analysts  Gregoire Thibault  and  Rafic El Haddad , who
lifted their earnings-per-share estimates for 2010 to 2012 by
16 percent per year on average and raised their rating on
Eiffage to “neutral” from “reduce.”  
 APRR probably won’t pay taxes in 2011 and 2012 as Eiffarie
will benefit from a French provision called “fiscal
integration” once it controls more than 95 percent of the
highway company, the analysts said.  
 Eiffarie plans to acquire the  shares  from funds managed by
Elliott Management Corp. and Sandell Asset Management Corp. by
June 24. Pending regulatory approval, it will then offer to buy
the rest of publicly traded APRR for 54.16 euros a share
following the payment of an 84-cent  dividend  on June 30.  
 Improved Ratios  
 “The deal will allow Eiffarie to refinance its debt in
2013 in a better situation and will improve the ratios of
Eiffarie-APRR, which should support APRR’s credit rating,” said
 Philippe Delmotte , head of investor relations at Paris-based
Eiffage, in a telephone interview today.  
 APRR’s  debt  is rated BBB- at Standard & Poor’s, the
credit-reporting company’s lowest investment grade. S&P has had
a negative outlook on the rating since June 2009, as the
economic crisis hurt traffic revenue last year.  
 Eiffage, France’s third-largest construction company, will
use its  cash  and available credit lines to finance the capital
increase of Eiffarie needed for the buyout of APRR, Delmotte
said.  
 Eiffarie was set up about five years ago.  Eiffage  has a
stake of 50 percent plus one share.  
 Macquarie Atlas  shares  rose 17 percent to 92 Australian
cents today, their biggest advance since Jan. 28.
