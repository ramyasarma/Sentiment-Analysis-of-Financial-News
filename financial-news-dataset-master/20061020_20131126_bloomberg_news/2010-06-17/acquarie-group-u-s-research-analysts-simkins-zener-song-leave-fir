             Macquarie Group Ltd. , the Australian
bank whose head of U.S. equity capital markets quit this week,
lost analysts  Joel Simkins  and  Kenneth Zener  yesterday.  
 Steve Song  and media analyst  Benjamin Stretch  also left the
bank in the past month, spokesman  Stephen Yan  confirmed. Simkins
covered gaming companies, Zener covered homebuilders and Song
was responsible for machinery companies.  
 At least eight analysts have left Sydney-based Macquarie’s
U.S. business this year. The firm has hired four analysts since
January and has more than doubled the number of publishing
analysts it had a year ago, Yan said. Equity capital markets
head  Jim Rossman  resigned earlier this week after two years at
the firm, Yan said June 16.  
 Macquarie, Australia’s largest investment bank, bought Fox-
Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller LLC in December to expand its
U.S. research and equities business. Macquarie generated $1.35
billion of revenue from the Americas for the year ended March
31, more than triple that of a year earlier. The firm has added
more than 30 people to its U.S. equities unit this year,
including research and sales and trading hires, Yan said.
