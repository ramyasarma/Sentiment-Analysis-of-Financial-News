             PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s largest
bank, fell the most in almost a week, after a  Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna  report that the government may not ask for a  dividend  to
help finance a possible takeover of  Bank Zachodni WBK SA .  
 PKO declined 1.1 percent, the biggest drop since June 11,
to 38.11 zloty as of 11:44 a.m. in Warsaw. The Polish  Treasury
Ministry , which controls the bank, may decide not to ask for a
2009 dividend as it wants it to buy Bank Zachodni, which Allied
Irish Banks Plc is trying to sell this year, Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  
 “We may have a situation that the government may be using
its controlling position to decide unilaterally, without
consulting holders of remaining 50 percent in the bank, about
such an important matter as an acquisition,” said  Marcin Materna , an analyst at Bank Millennium SA in Warsaw. “Neither
the form nor the premises are fully economically justified.”  
 Maciej Wewior , the ministry’s spokesman, and Elzbieta
Anders, PKO’s spokeswoman, weren’t immediately available to
comment on the report.  
 Dublin-based Allied Irish said in March it plans to sell
stakes in banks in the U.S. and Poland to help meet its bank
regulator’s requirement to raise 7.4 billion euros ($9 billion)
of capital. PKO is among banks such as Societe Generale SA, BNP
Paribas SA and OAO Sberbank that are said to be considering
bidding for Zachodni.  
 Zachodni shares  fell 0.2 percent to 200.5 zloty.
