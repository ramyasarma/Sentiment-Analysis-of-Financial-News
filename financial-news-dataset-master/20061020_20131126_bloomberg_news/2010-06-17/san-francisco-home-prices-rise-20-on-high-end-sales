             San Francisco Bay Area home prices
jumped 20 percent in May, sending the median above $400,000 for
the first time in almost two years, as high-end sales returned
to a “more normal” share of transactions,  MDA DataQuick  said.  
 The median price for houses and condominiums in the nine-
county region increased to $410,000 from $341,500 a year
earlier, the San Diego-based research company said today in a
statement. Sales rose 11 percent to 8,264 homes.  
 “We’re seeing a more normal mix of sales across the region
and across price categories, thanks in large part to the state
and federal tax credits coupled with incredibly low mortgage
rates,”  John Walsh , MDA DataQuick’s president, said in the
statement.  
 Sales of homes priced at $500,000 and higher rose 34
percent from May 2009, while sales of those costing less than
$300,000 fell 23 percent, the research company said. Total sales
for the month were the highest in the  Bay Area  since 2006.  
 Mortgage distress in higher-end areas along with
“motivated and realistic” sellers are fueling the sales
upswing, MDA DataQuick said. About 35 percent of single-family
home sales last month occurred in the most expensive third of
Bay Area ZIP codes. That compares with a 10-year average of 32
percent.  
 Jumbo loans, formerly defined as mortgages of at least
$417,000, financed 35 percent of home purchases in May, the
highest share since December 2007. Jumbos accounted for 32
percent in April and 26 percent in May 2009, according to MDA
DataQuick, a unit of Vancouver-based MacDonald Dettwiler &
Associates Ltd.  
 Most Expensive  
 Sales rose in the four most expensive counties, led by a 28
percent gain in Santa Clara. They climbed 24 percent in San
Mateo and San Francisco and 20 percent in Marin. Transactions
increased 8.l percent in Alameda, 5 percent in Napa and 0.6
percent in Contra Costa.  
 Solano and Sonoma had sales declines of 7.6 percent and 4.9
percent, respectively.  
 Median prices climbed in eight of the nine counties,
advancing 25 percent to $293,750 in Contra Costa; 18 percent to
$525,000 in Santa Clara; 18 percent to $390,000 in Alameda; and
almost 16 percent to $219,000 in Solano.  
 Prices rose 11 percent to $335,000 in Sonoma; 10 percent to
$605,000 in San Mateo; 9 percent to $675,500 in Marin; and 0.4
percent to $636,500 in San Francisco.  
 Napa showed the only decline, falling 5.4 percent to
$350,000, MDA DataQuick said.
