             Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. , a
Canadian oil-sands producer, has had talks with Asian companies
about forming a joint venture that may lower the company’s costs
and increase shareholder returns, Chairman  Richard Gusella  said.  
 “I would not call these discussions serious negotiations,
although some progressed further than others, but none have yet
been consummated,” Gusella said in an interview after the CAPP
Investment Symposium in Calgary yesterday. “We keep an open
mind about joint ventures against the advantages of proceeding
on our own, as we have done in the past with success.”  
 Connacher aims to double daily production to 20,000 barrels
in 2011 from a company estimate of an average 10,000 barrels
this year. Output may rise to 50,000 barrels a day by 2015 on
new discoveries, according to a company forecast.  
 Connacher, based in Calgary, will build its cash balance
next year and gain “significant capital-investment capacity in
2012,” Gusella said.  
 The company will likely continue talks with various
entities, including oil companies and sovereign wealth firms, to
see if a relationship can be established, reducing the need to
further access capital markets, Gusella said. He declined to
name the firms involved.  
 Connacher was unchanged at C$1.42 as of 3:59 p.m.in Toronto
trading. The stock has gained 11 percent this year.
