             M&T Bank Corp. rose the most in more
than a year, and trading of options on the shares surged to a
record, on renewed speculation Banco Santander SA of Spain will
buy the Buffalo, New York-based lender.  
 M&T rose 8.1 percent to $88.59 at 3:14 p.m. in New York. It
gained as much as 11 percent, the most intraday since May 2009.  
 Matias Inciarte, third vice-chairman of Spain’s biggest
bank, said today it had made no decision on whether to combine
its business with M&T. He spoke at a seminar in Santander,
Spain. The two banks were in merger discussions that fell apart
last month, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal
reported May 19.  
 Trading of bullish M&T options surged as investors bet that
the shares will extend gains. More than 23,000 calls to buy the
stock changed hands, 34 times the four-week average and four
times the number of calls to buy the shares. The most-active
contracts were June $90 calls, which expire tomorrow, followed
by July $90 calls.  
 The June $85 calls, which expire tomorrow, surged to $6
from 25 cents yesterday for the biggest gain among all M&T
contracts.  
 M&T spokesman Michael Zabel declined to comment.  
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Warren Buffett’s insurance and
investment firm, owned 5.56 million M&T shares as of March 31.
That made the Omaha, Nebraska-based company the second-biggest
shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
