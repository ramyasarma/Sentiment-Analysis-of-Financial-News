             Qualcomm Inc.  is facing a new
complaint over claims it breached European Union antitrust
rules, less than a year after the EU’s executive agency dropped
an investigation into the company.  
 Icera Inc., a maker of wireless chips, has lodged a
complaint with the European Commission, Qualcomm said in an e-
mailed statement today. The complaint “alleges that Qualcomm
has engaged in anticompetitive activity,” the company said,
adding that “matters are at a very preliminary stage and we are
currently reviewing the allegations.”  
 The Brussels-based commission, the antitrust agency for the
27-nation EU, in November dropped a four-year probe into the
company that started after competitors complained the chipmaker
was charging excessive royalties on patents. Qualcomm, the
world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, said the
latest complaint is similar to previous ones.  
 “We believe the new allegations to be equally meritless”
as the ones made in previous complaints, the San Diego-based
company said. “Qualcomm will cooperate fully with the
commission, as we have done in the past.”  
 Amelia Torres , a spokeswoman for the commission’s antitrust
unit, said the regulator had received a complaint. “We’re
looking into it and are in a fact-finding stage,” she said in
an interview in Brussels.  
 Sally Doherty, a spokeswoman for Bristol, England-based
Icera, declined to immediately comment.
