             Ramsarup Industries Ltd. , an Indian
maker of steel wire, rose the most in almost three years in
Mumbai trading after the Business Standard said  ArcelorMittal 
may buy a stake in the company.  
 Ramsarup rose as much as 19 percent to 86.90 rupees, the
biggest gain since July 10, 2007. The stock traded 13 percent
higher at 82.45 rupees as of 9:28 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Sensitive Index fell 0.1 percent.  
 The company, which has two iron ore leases in the eastern
state of Orissa, is in talks to sell a strategic stake to global
companies, including ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel
producer, the newspaper cited unidentified company officials as
saying.  
 Ashish Jhunjhunwala , chairman of Ramsarup, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment on his office phone. “We do
not comment on market rumors,” Mandakini Sud, a spokeswoman for
ArcelorMittal India said in an emailed response to questions.  
 Ramsarup’s two iron ore mines in Orissa have reserves of
7.1 million metric tons and 45 million tons, the report said
adding that production may start in April 2011.
