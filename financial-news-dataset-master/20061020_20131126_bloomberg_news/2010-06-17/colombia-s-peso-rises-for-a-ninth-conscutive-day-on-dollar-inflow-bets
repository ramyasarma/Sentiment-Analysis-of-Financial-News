             Colombia’s peso rose for a ninth
straight day, its longest winning streak in two years, amid
speculation foreign direct investment into oil and mining will
boost dollar inflows into the South American nation.  
 The peso gained 0.4 percent to 1,903.9 per U.S. dollar at
10:54 a.m. New York time, from 1,911.15 yesterday. It earlier
climbed to 1,901.25, its strongest level since March 18. The
currency gained for 11 straight days during the period ended
June 9, 2008. The peso has jumped 7.4 percent this year, the
best performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “There are big oil flows coming into Colombia,” said
Andres Munoz, head currency trader at Corporacion Financiera
Colombiana SA in Bogota. He forecasts the currency will trade
between 1,885 and 1,895 in the “short term.”  
 Colombia will attract about $10 billion in foreign direct
investment this year, Trade Minister  Luis Guillermo Plata  has
said. The nation received $7.2 billion of foreign direct
investment in 2009, after a record $10.6 billion the previous
year, according to the central bank.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.01
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.118 centavo to 120.187 centavos per peso.
