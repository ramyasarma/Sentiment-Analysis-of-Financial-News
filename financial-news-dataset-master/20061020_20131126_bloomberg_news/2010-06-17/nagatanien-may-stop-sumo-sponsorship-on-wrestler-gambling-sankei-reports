             Nagatanien Co., a Japanese instant-
food maker, may stop or reduce sponsorship of sumo tournaments
after some wrestlers and stablemasters admitted to illegal
baseball gambling, the Sankei newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.   
 The Tokyo-based company, which has been a sponsor since
2002, provides more than 12 million yen ($132,000) in prize
money for each tournament, the newspaper said.
