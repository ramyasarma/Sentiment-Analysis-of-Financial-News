             Ten-year Treasuries fell as a bond
sale by Spain eased concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
spreading, boosting stock markets and eroding demand for the
relative safety of U.S. securities.  
 The decline sent the  yield  up from near the lowest this
week as Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of bonds
today, its maximum target. U.S. notes rose earlier before
reports economists said will show manufacturing growth in the
Philadelphia region slowed and consumer prices fell. The Stoxx
Europe 600  Index  climbed for a seventh day, rising 0.4 percent.  
 “Spanish bonds performed well after the auction, and
Treasuries slipped as a result,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior
bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London.
The reports today “have bullish risk for the market,” Sian
said.  
 The yield on the 10-year note rose two basis points to 3.28
percent as of 6:30 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. It fell to 3.24 percent earlier, within two basis
points of the 3.22 percent reached two days ago. The 3.5 percent
security due May 2020 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 26/32.  
 Market turmoil stemming from the sovereign debt crisis
which started in Greece has spurred demand for the perceived
safety of U.S. government bonds. The 10-year  note yield  fell
almost one percentage point between April 5 and May 25 when it
reached 3.06 percent, the lowest since April 2009.  
 ‘Major Risk’  
 Financial market instability poses a “major downside
risk” to global economic growth and “urgent action” is needed
to rein in government budget deficits, the International
Monetary Fund said in a report prepared for a June 4-5 meeting
in Busan, South Korea, and released yesterday.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s  general economic
index  fell to 20 this month from 21.4 in May, according to a
Bloomberg survey before today’s report. Consumer prices dropped
0.2 percent in May, after declining 0.1 percent the previous
month, according to the median forecast of 79 economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey.  
 The difference in yield between Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities, or TIPS, and 10-year notes show money
managers expect the consumer price index to increase an average
2.03 percent annually in the next 10 years, down from 2.41
percent at the end of 2009.  
 Interest Rates  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 29 percent
chance the Fed will raise its benchmark rate by at least a
quarter-percentage point by its December meeting, down from 38
percent odds a month earlier.  
 The U.S. central bank lowered its fed funds  target rate  to
a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 to reduce
borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. The Federal Open
Market Committee next meets to review rates June 22-23.  
 The Federal Reserve will keep the rate unchanged for a
“very extended period” as Europe’s austerity measures curb
world demand, said  Paul McCulley  of Pacific Investment
Management Co.  
 Spanish bonds rose after the auction, pushing the yield on
the 10-year security down from the highest level since July
2008. The country sold 2020 and 2041 bonds at yields below the
prevailing market rates, and attracted bids worth as much as
2.45 times the securities on offer.  
 The  yield premium  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
government bonds instead of German bunds, the euro-region’s
benchmark securities, was at 209 basis points after the auction
results. It rose to 221 basis points yesterday, the most since
before the introduction of the euro, based on close-of-day
generic data.  
 “The strong demand for Spanish bonds should help restore
confidence,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , fixed income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in Paris.  
 Treasuries have returned 4.4 percent since the start of
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds, the euro-area’s benchmark securities, have returned 6.5
percent, while Spanish debt declined 4.3 percent, the indexes
showed.
