             Spain will use less than a third of
its 99 billion-euro ($122 billion) bank-rescue fund as it
restructures savings banks and prepares to publish stress tests
on lenders, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said.  
 Spain created the fund, known as FROB by its Spanish
initials, last year with initial capital of 9 billion euros and
the capacity to issue as much as 90 billion euros of debt. It
sold 3 billion euros of bonds last year.  
 “The Bank of Spain has to give those data but I would
venture to say that less than a third of that figure in all
certainty,” Salgado said today in an interview with broadcaster
 Telecinco  in Madrid. Stress tests on lenders will be published
on an individual basis, showing the financial sector is
“solid,” she said.  
 Jose Vinals , director of the International Monetary Fund’s
monetary and capital markets department and a former Bank of
Spain official, said in Washington today the FROB “is big
enough.”  
 Greece’s sovereign debt crisis has focused attention on
Spain’s public finances and the costs of buttressing the
country’s banks. They include the foundation-based lenders known
as “cajas,” which have been hobbled by a surge in bad  debts .
The Bank of Spain has seized two savings banks since the start
of the financial crisis and  Francisco Gonzalez , chairman of
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , said last week capital
markets were “closed” for most Spanish companies and banks.  
 Stress Tests  
 Bank of Spain Governor  Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez  said
yesterday the central bank will publish the results of stress
tests “to provide the markets with a perfectly clear idea of
the situation of the Spanish banking system.”  
 “There is nothing better than transparency to show
solvency, to give confidence, and to leave behind baseless
rumors,” Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  told a
news conference today in Brussels.
