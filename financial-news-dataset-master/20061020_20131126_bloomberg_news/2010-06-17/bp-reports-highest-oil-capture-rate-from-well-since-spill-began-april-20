             BP Plc captured 18,600 barrels of
oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well yesterday, a 78 percent
increase from the previous day and the most since the spill
began in April.  
 About 21 percent of the oil was burned aboard the Q4000, a
floating rig connected to the wellhead that began operations
early yesterday, BP said in a statement posted today on its
 website . The rest was stored aboard the Discoverer Enterprise, a
drillship that’s been collecting oil since June 4, BP said.  
 The amount of oil funneled from the well remains a fraction
of the 35,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels a day that a government-
led scientific team estimated is leaking. A fire aboard the
drillship temporarily halted recovery two days ago.  
 BP, based in London, plans to increase the recovery rate to
28,000 barrels a day next week and to 53,000 barrels a day by
June 30, said U.S. Coast Guard Admiral  Thad Allen , the national
incident commander. Allen spoke today during a conference call
with reporters.  
 BP rose as much as 32.8 pence, or 9.7 percent, to 369.8
pence in London, the biggest intraday gain since November 2008.
 The company  yesterday agreed to fund a $20 billion escrow
account to compensate spill victims, scrapped dividends this
year and pledged asset sales to assure financial stability while
it copes with spill costs.  
 The spill began after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig
exploded April 20 and sank two days later, killing 11 workers.
