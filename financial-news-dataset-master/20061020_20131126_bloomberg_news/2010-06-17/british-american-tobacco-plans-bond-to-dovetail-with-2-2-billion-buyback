             British American Tobacco Plc  plans
to sell new bonds next week as part of a plan to reduce its
refinancing risk by repurchasing as much as 1.75 billion euros
($2.2 billion) of debt due in 2011 and 2012, the company said.  
 BAT, Europe’s second-largest cigarette maker, is offering
to tender 750 million euros of 3.625 percent notes due in 2012
and 1 billion euros of 4.375 percent debt due in 2011, according
to two statements released today. The tenders will close next
week, when the company plans to issue new bonds in euros and
possibly pounds to fund the offers, said  Neil Wadey , deputy
group treasurer at London-based BAT.  
 The company is refinancing “at rates that they find
attractive at this moment,” Wadey said in a telephone interview.  
 BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc are managing the offerings,
according to the statements. BNP will purchase the 2011 notes
for BAT and sell them back to the company, according to Wadey.
