             Jerome Kerviel  offered a  Societe
Generale SA  internal controller champagne and presented
“coherent” explanations when questioned about his trading,
according to testimony in a Paris court today.  
 Marine Auclair, in charge of comparing traders’ reports
with the bank’s accounts, said she contacted Kerviel and his
superiors in April 2007 after finding a “mismatch” of
94 million euros ($116.4 million) between trades he reported and
what was booked in the accounting system.  
 When asked about the discrepancy, Auclair said Kerviel
“had a fairly nervous, worried air about him and said, ‘If you
take care of this gap, I’ll give you a bottle of champagne.’”  
 She testified that she never received any champagne.  
 Kerviel is  on trial  for faking documents, abuse of trust,
and computer hacking related to the 4.9 billion-euro trading
loss the bank incurred in 2008 after unwinding 50 billion euros
worth of unauthorized positions. He admitted yesterday to the
accusations, while insisting the bank knew of his actions.  
 While some of his trades “appeared fictitious” and
“didn’t have a real counterparty,” Auclair said Kerviel gave
her and other controllers “explanations that seemed coherent,
that corresponded to the situation.” He also provided documents
appearing to show they were genuine.  
 When asked about Kerviel’s testimony earlier this week that
his excuses were too “crude” to be believed, Auclair said,
“I’m not an idiot.” Faced with the same circumstances again,
she would still have believed what Kerviel told her, she said.  
 Criticizing Culture  
 An internal probe by the bank following the loss resulted
in two reports in 2008 criticizing the culture in which
compliance officers and controllers focused on fulfilling their
obligations rather than pursuing verifications.  
 Societe Generale was fined 4 million euros in July 2008 by
the French banking commission for risk control failures.  
 The bank “was a victim of the excess of confidence in its
front office,” Catherine Lubochinsky, who directs the finance
 masters degree program  at  Universite Pantheon-Assas Paris II ,
testified.  
 The rapid growth of derivatives trading in recent years
“outpaced the control of risks,” said Jean-Hubert Blanchet, a
professor in structured products at Paris-II. “You have a gap
between the creation of new products, and risk controllers who
aren’t necessarily notified at the same time.”  
 Judge Dominique Pauthe opened today’s hearing saying  Daniel Bouton , who stepped down as Societe Generale chief executive
officer in April 2008, will be called to testify on June 22, the
final day of testimony at the trial, which is to end June 25.
