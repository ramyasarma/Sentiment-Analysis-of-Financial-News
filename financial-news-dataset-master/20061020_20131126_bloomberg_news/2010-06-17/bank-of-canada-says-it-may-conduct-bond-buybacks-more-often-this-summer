             The Bank of Canada said it will
increase the frequency of its cash-management bond buyback
operations “on a pilot basis,” with buybacks to be conducted
“on most Tuesdays.”  
 The bank also said that switch operations for short- to
medium-term bonds are planned for the rest of the year ending
March 31, 2011. The bank made the announcement on its website.
