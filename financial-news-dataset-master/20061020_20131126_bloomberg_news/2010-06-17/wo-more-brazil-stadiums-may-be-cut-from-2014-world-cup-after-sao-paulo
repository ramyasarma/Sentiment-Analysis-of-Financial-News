             Two of the 12 Brazilian soccer
stadiums that presented proposals to host 2014 World Cup games
may not be able to meet financing requirements, Tourism Minister
 Luiz Barretto  said.  
 Privately owned stadiums in the southern cities of Porto
Alegre and Curitiba are facing the “same problems” to raise
financing as Sao Paulo’s Morumbi stadium, Barretto said in an
interview in London today. Morumbi was yesterday excluded from
hosting any games during the tournament after missing a deadline
to present financial guarantees.  
 The two stadiums that presented proposals to host World Cup
games are Estadio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul
state, which belongs to  Sport Club Internacional , and Arena da
Baixada, in Curitiba, Parana state, which serves  Clube Atletico
Paranaense , Barretto said.  
 The minister said the other nine stadiums, including Rio de
Janeiro’s Maracana, are on track to host matches.
