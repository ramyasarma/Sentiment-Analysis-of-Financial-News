             India’s 10-year  bonds  rose for a
third day after the government said it will buy back 100 billion
rupees ($2.1 billion) of securities at an auction tomorrow to
ease a  shortage of cash  at banks.  
 The  finance ministry  will tomorrow repurchase notes
maturing in 2010 and 2011. Banks have borrowed an average of 375
billion rupees a day from the central bank through its
repurchase-auction window this month as cash was drained after
phone companies made license-fee payments. Last month, banks
lent an average of 328 billion rupees every day to the Reserve
Bank.  
 “This will put to rest concern about liquidity in the
short term,” said S. Srikumar, a fixed-income trader at
Corporation Bank in Mumbai. “I’m reasonably bullish on bonds.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
five basis points to 7.54 percent as of 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price rose
0.32, or 32 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 101.75. Srikumar
predicted the  yield  will drop to 7.45 percent by next week.  
 The government’s repurchase plan follows measures taken by
the central bank to boost cash after mobile-phone companies paid
677.2 billion rupees for permits last month.  
 The Reserve Bank of India said on May 26 lenders can cut
their debt  holdings  until July 2 by as much as 0.5 percentage
point below the minimum regulatory requirement of 25 percent of
deposits. The central bank is also holding additional money-
market auctions every day to increase the availability of funds.  
 India will raise a combined 385.4 billion rupees from
winners of wireless broadband licenses by June 22, which may
squeeze cash further. Companies may pay up to 350 billion rupees
in quarterly tax this week,  Pradeep Madhav , managing director of
Mumbai-based Securities Trading Corp. of India, said last week.
