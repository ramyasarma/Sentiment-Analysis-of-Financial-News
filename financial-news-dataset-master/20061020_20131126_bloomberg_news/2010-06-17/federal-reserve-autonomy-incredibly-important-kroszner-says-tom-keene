             The Federal Reserve was designed to
represent the diverse interests of the country and to be
independent from politics in Washington, and needs to remain so,
according to former Fed Governor  Randall Kroszner .  
 “The key is to have some sort of decentralized
representation that’s not all in Washington,” Kroszner, 47,
said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene . “It was that key balance that was the genius of
what the Congress did back in the early part of the 20th
century, and it would be really valuable to try to maintain that
and it would be a shame to lose.”  
 The Fed beat back efforts this year to strip it of its
bank-supervision powers and allow audits of interest-rate
decisions. Now lawmakers are demanding increased disclosure and
unprecedented transparency after the Fed, often invoking
emergency powers, made more than $2 trillion of loans to end the
financial crisis. Kroszner, a professor of economics at the
University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, said the Fed
has done a “reasonably good job relative to other banks” over
the past century, and said any changes should be made with care.  
 “It’s incredibly important to get this right,” he said.  
 Senate negotiators on an overhaul of financial legislation
were ready to amend the bill to reduce the role of commercial
banks in naming Fed presidents, according to a counteroffer
released by Senate Banking Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd .
Under another change, the central bank, after a two-year delay,
would have to identify firms that borrow through its discount
window and participate in the Fed’s purchases or sales of assets
such as mortgage-backed securities.  
 Balanced Interests  
 A balance of members who represent the country is also
crucial, and it’s not necessary that each member hold a
doctorate in economics, according to Kroszner, who has a
master’s degree and PhD. in economics from Harvard University.  
 Kroszner resigned from the Fed board in January 2009, a
year after his term beginning in March 2006 expired. In May
2007, then-President  George W. Bush  nominated him for a full 14-
year term that would have begun in February 2008. The
Democratic-controlled Senate declined to act on Kroszner’s re-
nomination.  
 Obama nominee  Daniel Tarullo , a top adviser on
international economic policy to former President Bill Clinton,
replaced Kroszner. Tarullo, 57, is an attorney and a former law
professor.
