             The Association of Foreign Banks in
Germany said financial-market regulation should be coordinated
on the European Union level at the least, saying national
measures aren’t effective.  
 A national financial transaction tax would be
“ineffective,” the association, which represents more than 210
foreign banks in Germany, said in an e-mailed statement today.
