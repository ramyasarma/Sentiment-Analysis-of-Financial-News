             International Industrial Bank, a 
Russian lender controlled by lawmaker Sergei Pugachyov, must 
repay 10 billion rubles ($320 million) it owes Bank Rossii 
today or it may have its license revoked, Vedomosti reported, 
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  
 The Moscow-based lender, which also has 200 million euros 
($245 million) of bonds coming due July 6, owes a total of 31 
billion rubles to the central bank and will require the help of
its parent United Industrial Corp. to stay solvent, the Russian
newspaper reported.
