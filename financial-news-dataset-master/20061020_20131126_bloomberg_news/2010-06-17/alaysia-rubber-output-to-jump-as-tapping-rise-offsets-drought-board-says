             Natural rubber output in  Malaysia ,
the world’s third-largest grower, may surge 17 percent this year
as rising prices prompt farmers to increase tapping, offsetting
crop damage from drought, the Malaysian Rubber Board said.  
 “Drought has had an impact on production but overall
output will increase because of price,” Salmiah Ahmad, director
general of the  board , said in an interview.  
 Production this year may climb to as much as 1 million
metric tons, said Salmiah. That is more than the 900,000 tons
forecast by the nation’s Plantation Industries and Commodities
Ministry in May. Output last year was 856,189 tons.  
 Rubber futures in Tokyo have rallied about 12 percent from
a five-month low on May 17 on optimism that economic expansion
in  Asia  and record auto production in China, the biggest vehicle
market, will drive demand for the commodity used in tires.  
 Improving demand will likely support prices at “around the
current figure,” Salmiah said, without giving an estimate.  
 Rubber has climbed 73 percent on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange in the past year and reached a 21-month high of 338.5
yen a kilogram ($3,706 a ton) on April 16 on a seasonal drop in
supply from top growers. The contract for November delivery, the
most-active, dropped 2.1 percent to 279.7 yen at 11:10a.m. in
Tokyo, snapping a five-day, 9.8 percent winning streak.  
 Prices in Malaysia have already “touched bottom and
are expected to move up again,” said Salmiah. The average price
for benchmark Malaysian SMR 20 grade rubber this year is
expected to be about 9 ringgit ($2.75) a kilo, she said. The
price has averaged 9.95 ringgit so far this year, according to
data on Malaysian Rubber Board’s  website .  
   China  Factor  
 Malaysia’s natural rubber exports may surge 28 percent
this year to 900,000 tons, said Salmiah.  
 “Demand for Malaysian rubber is expected to remain
strong,” she said. “Although the European crisis may weaken
demand, the China factor is stronger than the Europe factor.”
Consumption in China, which accounts for 40 percent of
Malaysia’s exports, is growing at about 10 percent a year, she
said.  Europe  buys about 13 percent.  
 China’s automobile output this year may grow by as much as
15 percent, expanding from a record to 15 million units, Gu
Xianghua, deputy general secretary of the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers, said May 29.  
 The country’s vehicle sales surged 46 percent to 13.6
million units last year, overtaking the U.S. as the world’s
biggest auto market.
