             BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Tony
Hayward failed to pay attention to safety at the Gulf of Mexico
oil well that exploded on April 20, Representative Henry Waxman
said.  
 “We could find no evidence that you paid any attention to
the tremendous risk BP was taking,” Waxman, a California
Democrat, said at the opening of a House hearing with Hayward as
the only witness. “There is not a single e-mail or document
that shows you paid the slightest attention to the dangers at
this well.”
