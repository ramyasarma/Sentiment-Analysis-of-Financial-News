             Authorities arrested 485 people
since March in the largest nationwide mortgage-fraud crackdown
of its kind, the U.S. Justice Department said.  
 During the enforcement effort, 1,215 criminal defendants
responsible for $2.3 billion in losses faced some type of legal
action, the department said. The crackdown, dubbed Operation
Stolen Dreams, also included 191 civil cases resulting in the
recovery of more than $147 million.  
 “This represents the largest collective enforcement effort
ever brought to bear in confronting  mortgage fraud ,” said
Attorney General  Eric Holder  at a news conference in Washington.
“These schemes are despicable, they are dangerous to our
economy and they will not be tolerated.”  
 The initiative was organized by President  Barack Obama ’s
financial fraud task force. The Federal Bureau of Investigation
has more than 3,000 pending mortgage-fraud cases, almost double
the number in fiscal year 2008, Holder said.  
 Authorities in Miami arrested two people who allegedly
targeted the Haitian-American community, sometimes claiming they
would help on immigration and housing matters and instead using
victims’ information to create fake documents to obtain
mortgages, Holder said.  
 In Detroit yesterday, several people were charged in a $100
million “ghost loan” scheme in which suspects posed as
mortgage brokers, appraisers and real estate agents and used
straw buyers to obtain 500 mortgages on 180 properties, Holder
said.  
 Criminal Complaints  
 Federal officials in New Jersey yesterday announced
criminal complaints charging 28 people with participating in
mortgage scams that sought to defraud lenders out of more than
$5.5 million. Among the defendants were real estate agents,
investors and mortgage consultants, according to a statement
from the FBI and U.S. Attorney  Paul Fishman .  
 A Queens, New York man pleaded guilty to leading a $10
million scheme that defrauded mortgage lenders. Sharmon Howell,
36, today admitted in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that he
headed a ring that recruited straw buyers to purchase homes and
obtained more than two dozen fraudulent loans, according to
prosecutors.
