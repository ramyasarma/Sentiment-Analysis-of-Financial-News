             German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
she will push for a tax on banks and closer surveillance to
prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.  
 “Germany and France are very much in favor of putting the
people who caused the crisis under stronger surveillance,”
Merkel told reporters before a meeting of European Union leaders
in Brussels today.
