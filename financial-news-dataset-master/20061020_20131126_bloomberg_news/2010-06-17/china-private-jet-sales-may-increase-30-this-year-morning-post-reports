             China’s private jet sales may rise
30 percent this year in China as some residents increase
business interests in Africa, America and Europe, the South
China Morning Post said, citing Asia Jet, a private aviation
company.  
 Sales may rise by an average of between 20 and 25 percent
year-on-year over the next decade, Asia Jet Chief Executive
Officer Mike Walsh was cited as saying. Asia Jet operates one of
the largest fleets of private jets in the region, the newspaper
said.
