             European stocks  rose for a seventh
day, the longest winning streak for nine months, after a Spanish
bond sale eased concern about the region’s debt and BP Plc
surged, overshadowing worse-than-forecast U.S. economic reports.  
 Banco Santander SA gained 1.6 percent as Spain sold 3.5
billion euros ($4.3 billion) of bonds, the maximum set for the
auction.   BP Plc  rallied 6.7 percent as the company scrapped
dividends and pledged asset sales to meet U.S. demands for a $20
billion fund to help victims of the oil spill. Fresnillo Plc led
a decline in mining stocks, falling 2.8 percent.  
 The benchmark  Stoxx 600  advanced 0.2 percent to 254.88. The
gauge has rebounded 9.8 percent from its 2010 low on May 25
after concern about levels of government debt pushed the index
to the cheapest level relative to earnings in more than a year.  
 “There is still the issue of Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis but policy efforts look as if they’re going in the right
direction,” said London-based  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin Holdings Plc, which has 22 billion pounds ($32.6
billion) under management. “Volatility is going to be with us
for a while.”  
 Stocks earlier erased gains after a report in the U.S.
showed  manufacturing  in the Philadelphia region expanded in June
at a slower rate than forecast as a measure of factory
employment contracted for the first time in seven months.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index dropped to 8, a 10-month low, from 21.4 in May. Economists
forecast the measure would fall to 20, according to the median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings above zero
signal growth.  
 U.S. Jobs  
 Separate figures from the U.S. Labor Department showed the
number of Americans seeking jobless benefits last week
unexpectedly rose to a one-month high.  
 National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of 17 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent,
France’s CAC 40 rose 0.2 percent and Germany’s DAX advanced 0.5
percent.  
 Santander, Spain’s largest bank, gained 1.6 percent to 9.03
euros. Smaller rival Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA advanced
1.3 percent to 8.86 euros.  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of 10-year and 30-year bonds,
the maximum set for the auction, as a decline in prices enticed
buyers.  
 Stress Tests  
 Separately, Santander scored the highest rating among
Europe’s largest banks in stress tests carried out by the
Committee of European Banking Supervisors, El Pais reported,
citing unidentified Spanish officials.  
 BP, battling to contain the Gulf of Mexico spill, rallied
6.7 percent to 359.7 pence. Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  met
Obama at the White House and agreed on payments over four years
to finance an independent body that will settle claims resulting
from a damaged oil well that’s spewing as much as 60,000 barrels
of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico.  
 “A line has been drawn and we could see some sort of
recovery from here,” said London-based  Manoj Ladwa , a London-
based strategist at ETX Capital. “Although they are paying $20
billion it has provided some clarity going forward. It’s also
likely that we are going to see less of that aggressive rhetoric
coming out of the U.S.”  
 Selling Fields  
 Chief Financial Officer  Byron Grote  said yesterday that
halting the $10 billion-a-year  dividend , reducing investments in
drilling and selling oil and gas fields would do enough to
ensure the company’s financial stability. Credit swap contracts
before the announcement showed investors pricing in a 39 percent
risk of default within five years.  
 Automobile stocks climbed 2.3 percent for the biggest gain
among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Porsche SE , the
maker of the 911 sports car, jumped 5.3 percent to 34.60.
Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest carmaker, climbed 3.8 percent
to 75.20 euros. Michelin & Cie., the world’s second-largest
tiremaker, rose 2.2 percent to 60.06 euros.  
 Nokia Oyj  retreated 0.8 percent to 7.16 euros, extending
yesterday’s 9 percent selloff, as analysts from banks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. slashed their share price estimates and
profit forecasts for the world’s largest maker of mobile phones.  
 Goldman reduced its price target for Nokia’s shares by 27
percent to 7.70 euros and cuts its 2010 earnings estimate by 25
percent to 47 cents per share after the company yesterday
lowered its revenue and margin forecasts.  
 Basic resources shares fell 1.2 percent for the biggest
drop among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Fresnillo ,
the world’s largest primary silver producer, slid 2.8 percent to
1,025 pence. Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a Kazakh metal
producer, slipped 2.3 percent to 1,042 pence. Xstrata Plc
declined 2.4 percent to 1,010.5 pence.  
 Copper, lead, nickel and tin were among metals declining
in London.  
 Eiffage, Imerys  
 Eiffage SA  surged 10 percent to 39.96 euros, the biggest
advance since September 2008, after a unit it jointly controls
said it’s buying out minority shareholders of a French toll-road
operator, shoring up the unit’s finances.  
 Eiffage and Sydney-based Macquarie Atlas Roads Group said
in separate statements that Eiffarie, the joint venture they own
with Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund LP, will buy 13.7
percent of APRR for 854 million euros, or 55 euros a share,
adding to its 81.5 percent holding.  
 Natixis SA raised its recommendation for France’s third-
biggest construction company to “neutral” from “reduce.”  
 Imerys SA , a minerals processor, jumped 6.4 percent to
45.17 euros for its biggest increase in five weeks. CA Cheuvreux
raised its recommendation on the stock to “outperform” from
“underperform.”
