             Li Qihong, mayor of Zhongshan city 
in southern China’s Guangdong province, has been detained by 
the Communist Party’s investigators for possible breach of 
party discipline, Wenweipo newspaper said on its website.  
 Li, who has been mayor since 2007, is estimated to have 
amassed 2 billion yuan ($293 million) of assets that can’t be 
accounted for, the Chinese-language newspaper said, citing 
people familiar with the city’s politics, without naming them.
Four of her relatives were also detained for investigation, the
newspaper said.  
 An officer answering the phone at the Zhongshan mayor’s 
office declined to confirm or deny Wenweipo’s report of Li’s 
detention.
