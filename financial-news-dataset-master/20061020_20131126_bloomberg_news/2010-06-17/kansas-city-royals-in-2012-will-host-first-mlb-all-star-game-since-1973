             The Kansas City Royals will host the
2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game for the first time
since 1973, Commissioner  Bud Selig  said.  
 The game, tentatively scheduled to be played July 10 at
Kauffman Stadium, will be the third to take place in Kansas
City. The last occasion was July 24, 1973, when the National
League won 7-1.  
 “This will be a golden opportunity for the rest of the
baseball world to discover what we already know, that the new,
improved Kauffman Stadium is one of the great facilities in all
of sports,” Royals owner  David Glass  said in a statement
yesterday.
