             Korea Housing Finance Corp., the
state-run home funding provider, will begin meeting with
investors from June 21 to market its benchmark-size dollar bond
sale, according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Meetings will take place in Singapore, Hong Kong, London,
Los Angeles, Boston and New York, the person said, asking not to

 Korea Housing Finance hired BNP Paribas SA and Standard

Korean residential mortgages, another person said on June 16.
