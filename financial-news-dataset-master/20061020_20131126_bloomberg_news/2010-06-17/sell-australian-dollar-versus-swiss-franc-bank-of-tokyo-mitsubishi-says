             Investors should sell the Australian
dollar versus the Swiss franc after the European nation’s
central bank eased a policy of fighting gains in its currency,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 The Swiss National Bank, which has been buying foreign
currencies since March 2009 to counter the threat of deflation,
said today those risks have “largely disappeared” and raised
its growth forecast. An Australian index of leading economic
indicators yesterday showed the weakest annual growth rate in
three months in April.  
 “With the global economic outlook set to remain more
uncertain in the quarters ahead and with the SNB set to step
away from its aggressive intervention undertaken in the year to
date, we expect demand for the Swiss franc to remain strong,”
analysts led by  Derek Halpenny  in London wrote in a note to
clients today.  
 Investors should sell the Australian currency, known as the
Aussie, versus the Swiss franc with a target of 0.875 francs per
Aussie, the analysts wrote. An “obvious stop” is just above
parity, they wrote.  
 The franc rose 1.5 percent today to 0.963 per Australian
dollar. The Swiss currency has lost 3.5 percent this year versus
the Aussie.  
 The SNB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25
percent today at its quarterly meeting. An Australian gauge of
future economic growth rose at an annualized rate of 7.6 percent
after gaining 8.8 percent in March, Westpac Banking Corp. and
the Melbourne Institute said in Sydney yesterday.
