             Hungary’s proposed special bank tax
is a condition of financial stability for this year, Economy and
Finance Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said in an interview with
Figyelo weekly.  
 The government’s 200 billion forint ($875 million) expected
revenue this year from the tax on financial institutions is
“set in stone,” Matolcsy said according to the transcript of
the interview. He said the distribution of the tax among
financial institutions will be determined based on profit and
revenue, Figyelo said.
