             When the  SummerStage  free concert
series lost soft-drink maker  Snapple  as its big sponsor,
overseer David Rivel began thinking about cutbacks. Then he got
a white knight with a flag to wave.  
 MasterCard International Inc . stepped forward this year to
offer a one-year sponsorship that allows it to plaster its name
on posters and signs at SummerStage venues in all five of New
York City’s boroughs.  
 Cheryl Guerin, MasterCard’s senior vice president
overseeing digital marketing in the U.S., declined to disclose
the value of the sponsorship.  
 “For us, it was the draw of SummerStage,” Guerin said in
a phone interview. “It provides our cardholders with great
priceless music and a cultural experience, and so it was a
natural fit.”  
 The MasterCard deal allowed SummerStage to unveil a menu of
 more than 100 free concerts  and performances for its 25th
anniversary, the largest lineup in the festival’s history. The
program highlights musicians who got their start in New York.
They include jazz pianist  McCoy Tyner  (June 23) and the  Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater  (July 23). Salsa master  Eddie
Palmieri  and his fiery Latin jazz ensemble, La Perfecta II, will
perform on June 22 at  Soundview Park  in the Bronx, the borough
where he grew up.  
 Rising opera stars  Susanna Phillips  and  Michael Fabiano 
perform July 12 in a recital as part of the Metropolitan Opera’s
Summer Recital Series.  
 Phillips, a soprano who made her Met debut last season as
Musetta in Puccini’s “La Boheme,” received the opera house’s
fifth Beverly Sills Artist Award for young singers in April.  
 New York’s Diversity  
 “The lineup shows you the diversity of the music that
comes out of New York,” said Rivel, executive director of the
City Parks Foundation that manages SummerStage, in a phone
interview.  
 SummerStage has provided free music, dance, jazz and
literary events to New York residents since its start in 1986.
The program, which has a budget of $4.9 million this year,
expects to attract more than 200,000 people, Rivel said.  
 Foundations, corporations and individuals cover 90 percent
of City Parks Foundation’s budget, which is about $10 million,
he said.  
 “We knew in a tough economy that the demand for our
programs would even be greater,” Rivel said. “We’re not alone
in all this. Some nonprofits are still struggling.”
