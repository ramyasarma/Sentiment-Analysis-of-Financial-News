             OAO Rosneft is seeking BP Plc’s 
former stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Russia’s only 
non-state oil export link, Kommersant reported, citing 
unidentified people at OAO Lukoil and the country’s Energy 
Ministry.   
 Rosneft, which now holds a 3.83 percent stake in the 
pipeline through a venture with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, wants to
buy the 5.75 percent stake sold by BP to Moscow-based Lukoil 
for $1.6 billion last year, the newspaper said. Rosneft and 
Lukoil are discussing the pipeline capacity that Rosneft would 
get with the stake purchase, according to Vedomosti. Press 
officials at Rosneft and Lukoil declined to comment to the 
newspaper.
