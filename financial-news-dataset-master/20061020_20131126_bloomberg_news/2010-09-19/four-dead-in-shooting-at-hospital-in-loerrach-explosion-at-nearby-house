             An armed woman who shot a male
nurse in the head at a German hospital probably also killed her
estranged husband and the couple’s 5-year-old son at her
apartment just before the rampage, police said.  
 Firefighters found the bodies of the man and the child
after responding to an explosion and fire yesterday in the 41-
year-old woman’s legal practice in the southern city of
Loerrach, local police said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “It seems that this explosion was planned,” state
prosecutor Dieter Inhofer said on ARD television today. “We
have evidence that a flammable substance was used.”  
 Three people, including a police officer at the hospital,
were wounded by the suspected shooter, who used a .22 caliber
handgun, police spokesman Eugen Wiessler said by telephone.
Police fatally shot the woman during a firefight on the second
floor of the city’s St. Elisabeth’s Hospital, he said.  
 It’s “very likely” that the two victims in the apartment
the woman used as her law office were dead when the blast
happened, Loerrach police spokesman Joachim Langanky said.
Autopsies are underway to determine how they died, he said.  
 The nurse was shot several times in the head and also
suffered stab wounds, the police statement said. Police, who
initially said the woman used a shotgun, didn’t identify her or
the victims.  
 The woman was seen running from her apartment building at
about 6 p.m. local time yesterday and started shooting in the
street, wounding two male passers-by, Langanky said.  
 ‘Spraying the Place’  
 “All we know is that after the explosion, the woman was
observed going into the hospital and spraying the place with
gunfire,” Inhofer said. “We don’t know yet why she went to the
hospital.”  
 The shooting spree is reminiscent of previous attacks that
have prompted debate about the country’s weapons laws. A school
shooting in March last year in the town of Winnenden, about 20
kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Stuttgart, resulted in 16
deaths after a camouflage-clad teenage gunman entered the
building and opened fire, killing nine students and three
teachers. He killed three more people as he fled in a hijacked
car before turning the gun on himself in a gunfight with police.
