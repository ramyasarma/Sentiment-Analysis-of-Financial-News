             Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the country won’t need financial aid from the
European Union as it prepares to sell as much as 1.5 billion
euros ($2 billion) in a bond auction this week.  
 Lenihan told the  Sunday Telegraph  he rejected speculation
that the cost of bailing out its banking system will force the
country to turn to the EU and the International Monetary Fund
for emergency funding. Finance ministry spokesman  Eoin Dorgan 
confirmed the remarks.  
 Lenihan is struggling to convince investors that the
government can shore up the banking system after Standard &
Poor’s downgraded the country’s credit rating on concern that
the cost of the bailout is rising. The extra  yield  that
investors demand to hold 10-year Irish government bonds over
German counterparts rose to a euro-era high of 387 basis points
on Sept. 17.  
 Michael Somers , former chief executive officer of Ireland’s
National Treasury Management Agency, told the  Irish Times  in an
interview published Sept. 18 that the total cost of the banking
bailout could reach 40 billion euros.  
 Bond yields rose after economists at Barclays Plc last week
said that Ireland may need to seek aid if conditions worsen.
They also said that Ireland has a “comfortable near-term
liquidity position.”  
 ‘Negative’ Sentiment  
 “Sentiment had been getting more negative and there were a
couple of pieces which have been reported in the media in a
negative way,” economist  Juliet Tennent  at Goodbody
Stockbrokers said in a Sept. 17 telephone interview. “I think
it’s been blown out of proportion.”  
 Ireland’s  National Treasury Management Agency  will test
investor demand for Irish debt when it sells between 1 billion
euros and 1.5 billion euros of four- and eight-year bonds
 tomorrow . Irish central bank governor  Patrick Honohan  is
scheduled to give a speech later today on regulation and the
banking system.  
 “The Irish auctions will succeed, it’s a question of
cost,”  Bill Blain , co-head of fixed income at Matrix Corporate
Capital LLP in London, said in an e-mailed note today. “We’ve
seen buyers of Irish paper in looking to bottom fish bargains in
cheap government-guaranteed paper.”  
 The premium investors charge to hold Irish debt was almost
unchanged at 386.1 points today. It has risen from 227.5 points
at the start of August.  
 “We have to go out there and put our best foot forward and
tell the international community we are doing our very best,”
 John Gormley , leader of Ireland’s Green Party, said in an
interview with Dublin’s RTE Radio today.
