Turkey has no immediate plans for
additional measures to stem capital inflows that have pushed its
currency higher, Central Bank Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  said.  The country’s readiness to take such measures in future
would “depend on the strength of the inflows,” Yilmaz said in
an interview at a conference in Beirut today. He didn’t give
further details.  The lira has risen almost 5 percent against the dollar this
year and 8 percent against the euro, the currency of its main
European export markets. Investors are lured by Turkey’s
benchmark interest rate of 7 percent, compared with near-zero in
many developed markets. The lira’s appreciation has led Turkish
industrialists to demand action from the government and central
bank to weaken it.  Leaders from the Group of 20 developed economies are due to
discuss global currency imbalances at a meeting in South Korea
starting on Nov. 11. Emerging economies including Brazil and
South Africa have sought to weaken their currencies after a
surge in investment from Western nations pushed their value up.  Yilmaz last month increased the amount of dollars that the
central bank buys in daily currency auctions as the lira rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
