             Home sales probably increased in
August, a sign the U.S. real estate market is stabilizing after
the expiration of a tax credit caused demand to plunge,
economists said before reports this week.  
 Purchases of new and previously owned homes rose 7 percent
to a combined 4.395 million annual pace, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. A separate report may show
 orders  for long-lasting goods excluding transportation equipment
rebounded last month.  
 “Housing is in a fragile bottoming process,” said  Aaron Smith , a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester,
Pennsylvania. The projected gains in home sales and durable
goods are “consistent with stabilizing growth, albeit at a
slower” pace than earlier this year, he said.  
 Builders such as  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.  face a housing
market depressed by unemployment close to 10 percent and rising
foreclosures, making it difficult for mortgage rates near record
lows to stoke demand. Combined with growth in manufacturing, the
figures underscore the Federal Reserve’s view that the economy,
while decelerating, will avoid slipping back into a recession.  
 Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his fellow U.S. central
bankers meet Sept. 21 to determine whether the economy needs
additional stimulus. The Fed’s benchmark interest rate is
already in a range from zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been
since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month
forecast the Fed’s Open Market Committee will keep the rate
unchanged until late next year.  
 The central bank said in its Beige Book survey of regional
Fed banks earlier this month that there were “widespread signs
of a deceleration” in the economy from mid-July through the end
of August. Most areas of the U.S. reported “very low or
declining home sales.”  
 Existing-Home Sales  
 Sales of  previously owned homes  rose to a 4.1 million
annual rate in August from a 3.83 million pace, according to the
median estimate before the National Association of Realtors’
report on Sept. 23 in Washington. The 7.1 percent gain would
follow the record 27 percent plunge in July.  
 The following day, the Commerce Department will release the
 new-home sales  figures. The median forecast calls for purchases
to rise to a 295,000 pace, up 6.9 percent from a month earlier.  
 Existing-home sales account for more than 80 percent of the
market and are counted when a deal is closed. New-home sales are
recorded when a contract is signed.  
 The government’s homebuyers credit of as much as $8,000 for
first-time buyers required contracts by signed by April 30.
While the deadline for closing was moved to Sept. 30 from an
original June 30, the bulk of purchasers wanting to qualify had
already completed the buying process.  
 Temporary Relief  
 The tax incentive provided temporary relief for the
industry that precipitated the worst recession since the 1930s.
With the economy cooling from earlier this year, lawmakers are
now debating whether to extend tax cuts put in place by
President George W. Bush.  
 Democrats are pushing President Barack Obama’s plan to let
tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans
expire and permanently extend lower rates on individuals with
incomes up to $200,000 and for couples up to $250,000.  
 The end of the homebuyer credit, joblessness and sagging
consumer confidence prompted a decline in orders at Hovnanian,
the largest homebuilder in New Jersey said on Sept 1. The
company said its net orders dropped 37 percent in the quarter
ended July 31 from a year earlier.  
 Jobs Are ‘Key’  
 “Job creation is the key to a housing recovery, which
makes it difficult to predict how improvements in the economy
and housing market play out,” Chief Executive Officer Ara
Hovnanian said in a statement.  
 That may explain why shares of builders have declined this
year, while the broader market has gained. The Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index , which includes D.R. Horton
Inc. and Lennar Corp., is down 7.7 percent this year compared
with a 0.9 percent rise for the S&P 500.  
 Another report on housing this week, due Sept. 21 from the
Commerce Department, will show  starts  of homes rose to a 550,000
annual rate in August, from 546,000 a month earlier, according
to the median forecast in the Bloomberg survey.  
 Construction permits for new homes were little changed at a
560,000 pace, indicating ground-breaking will be hard-pressed to
pick up in coming months.  
 Rising Foreclosures  
 Builders and sellers are competing with rising
foreclosures, which means homes stay on the market longer and
prices are restrained. Home seizures reached a record for the
third time in five months in August, RealtyTrac Inc. said Sept.
16.  
 The weakness in housing is making the economy more
dependent on gains in manufacturing. The Commerce Department is
scheduled to release the  durable  goods report on Sept. 24.
Bookings including those for transportation equipment probably
fell 1 percent in August after a 0.4 percent gain, according to
the median forecast.  
 Excluding transportation, orders probably rose 1 percent
last month, the survey showed. Bookings for non-defense  capital
goods  excluding aircraft, a proxy for future business
investment, may have increased 4 percent.
