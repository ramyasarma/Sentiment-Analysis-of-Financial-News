             Australia’s dollar rose to a two-
year high after Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  signaled
policy makers may need to resume raising interest rates should a
mining boom stoke the economy next year and boost inflation.  
 The currency has gained 6.4 percent this month as traders
raised to 31 percent the  chance  that the central bank will
increase the target lending rate on Oct. 5. Tomorrow the RBA
will release minutes of this month’s meeting, when it extended a
pause in raising borrowing costs.  
 “The market is responding to the line that Governor
Stevens thinks growth will increase to something above trend,”
said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in Hong Kong. “The Aussie should remain underpinned at
least until the end of the month. Investors who are looking to
fade this rally can afford to be patient.”  
 Australia’s currency rose 1.4 percent to 94.90 U.S. cents
at 12:04 p.m. in New York, from 93.63 cents on Sept. 17. It
touched 94.94 cents, the strongest level since July 2008. New
Zealand’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to 73.02 U.S. cents.  
 “If downside possibilities do not materialize, the task
ahead is likely to be one of managing a fairly robust upswing,”
Stevens told a forum in Shepparton, Victoria, today. “Part of
that task will, clearly, fall to monetary policy.”  
 A Credit Group Suisse AG  index  showed swaps traders
increased bets on a rate increase next month, from a 19 percent
chance on Sept. 17, after Stevens’ comments.  
 “There could be a risk for the Aussie in coming weeks if
those expectations are proved wrong,” said Trinh.  
 Target Lending Rates  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3
percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan  and
zeroto 0.25 percent in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  
 Australia’s dollar, this quarter’s best-performing major
currency, is also the most overvalued. Purchasing power parity,
a measure of the cost of goods relative to other countries,
shows the Aussie is 27 percent too expensive, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
