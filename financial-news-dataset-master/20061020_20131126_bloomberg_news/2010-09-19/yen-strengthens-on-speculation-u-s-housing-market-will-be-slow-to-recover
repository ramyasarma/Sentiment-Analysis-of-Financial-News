             The dollar fell toward a five-week
low against the euro before a report likely to show confidence
among U.S. homebuilders stayed near 17-month low, adding to
evidence the economic recovery is losing steam.  
 The U.S. currency dropped for the fifth time in six days
versus the 16-nation euro amid speculation the Federal Open
Market Committee will say at a meeting tomorrow it’s considering
further measures to keep borrowing costs near zero. The Swedish
krona traded near a one-week low against the euro after Prime
Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  won a second term though his
coalition may have to rule as a minority.  
 “We need to see how the housing data drops out,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , global head of foreign-exchange strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit in
London. “It’s also all about the FMOC and whether the market
perceives that the Fed are going to get out the big guns again
and look at additional easing.”  
 The dollar dropped to $1.3108 per euro as of 9:06 a.m. in
London from $1.3050 in New York on Sept. 17, when it fell to
$1.3159, the weakest level since Aug. 11. The U.S. currency
slipped to 85.61 yen from 85.86 yen. The yen was at 112.26 per
euro from 112.06 at the end of last week.  
 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index in the U.S. was at 14 this month, from 13 in
August, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The reading has
stayed below the 50 level, which means a majority of respondents
said conditions were poor, since April 2006. The August reading
was the lowest since March 2009.  
 Fed Meeting  
 The Fed is likely to affirm at this week’s meeting its
pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period” and
maintain the floor on its holdings of securities, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “The bears are naturally hoping for U.S. housing data over
the next two days to disappoint,”  Philip Wee , a senior currency
economist in Singapore at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., wrote today
in a note to clients. “The skeptics are hoping for more
quantitative-easing measures from the Fed.”  
 The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against
currencies from six major U.S. trading partners, dropped 0.4
percent to 81.100. The gauge has dropped for the past two weeks.  
 The krona fell by as much as 0.4 percent to 9.2610 against
the euro, the weakest since Sept. 9, before trading at 9.2285
from 9.2276. It gained 0.5 percent to 7.0342 per dollar.  
 Reinfeldt’s coalition probably lost six seats compared with
the 2006 election, giving it 172 lawmakers in the 349-seat
parliament, a Sveriges TV estimate showed. The opposition
probably lost 14 seats and will have 157 lawmakers. The Swedish
Democrats won 20 seats, STV estimates.  
 Pimco’s El-Erian  
 The Fed will also reduce its economic growth forecasts at
this week’s meeting, said  Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief executive
at Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
biggest bond fund.  
 The Fed “should and, I suspect, will,” cut its growth
predictions, El-Erian, who is based in Newport Beach, California,
wrote in an opinion piece published on Pimco’s website.  
 The extra  yield  offered by 10-year Treasuries over similar-
maturity Japanese government bonds has shrunk to 1.66 percentage
points from this year’s high of 2.61 points on April 5.  
 Australia’s dollar climbed toward a two-year high against
the greenback, after central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens 
signaled policy makers may need to resume raising interest rates
should a mining boom stoke the economy. His comments spurred
traders to raise  bets  he will increase rates at the central
bank’s next meeting.  
 ‘Robust Upswing’  
 “The task ahead is likely to be one of managing a fairly
robust upswing,” Stevens told a forum in the regional city of
Shepparton in Victoria state today. “Part of that task will,
clearly, fall to monetary policy.” The RBA will tomorrow
release the minutes of its Sept. 7 meeting, when it left its
benchmark on hold for a fourth month and said it was appropriate
“for the time being.”  
 The Aussie rose 1.1 percent to 94.65 U.S. cents from last
week, after reaching 94.69 cents, matching the strongest level
since July 2008. There is a 31 percent the central bank will
raise rates at its Oct. 5 policy review, up from 19 percent odds
at the end of last week, according to a Credit Suisse AG  index .  
 “The market is responding to the line that Governor
Stevens thinks growth will increase to something above trend,”
said  Sue Trinh , a Hong Kong-based senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada. “Aussie should remain underpinned at
least till the end of the month. Investors who are looking to
fade this rally can afford to be patient.”
