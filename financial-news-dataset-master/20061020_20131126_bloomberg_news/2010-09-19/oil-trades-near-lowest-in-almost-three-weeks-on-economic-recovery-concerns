             Oil pared gains to trade little
changed in New York on concern a slowing economic recovery will
erode demand for fuels in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude
consumer.  
 Crude had fallen in the past four days, losing 4.6 percent.
Twenty-seven of 58 economists polled by Bloomberg News this
month see U.S. economic growth in 2011 below the 2.5 percent to
2.8 percent pace Federal Reserve policy makers peg as the long-
term trend.  U.S. oil inventories  were at 357.4 million barrels
in the week to Sept. 10, the most for that time of the year in
the past five years, according to the Energy Department.  
 “The still historically high inventories today are going
to put a lid on any surge,” said  Victor Shum , a senior
principal with Purvin & Gertz Inc. in Singapore. “This points
to range-bound trading in the near term, with the low $70s
showing quite a bit of support.”  
 The October contract was at $73.73 a barrel, up 7 cents, at
2:47 p.m. Singapore time in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices earlier climbed as much as 36 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $74.02.  
 Futures lost 3.7 percent last week, the biggest decline
since the week ended Aug. 13, after Enbridge Energy Partners LP
restarted a U.S. pipeline that sends Canadian oil to refineries
in the Midwest.  
 The October Nymex contract is expiring tomorrow. The more
active November future was at $75.10 a barrel, up 18 cents.  
 ‘Short-term Behavior’  
 “At times like this, oil tends to reflect things like
movements in the dollar and maybe some short-term investor
behavior,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “The opening up
of Line 6A probably didn’t help prices.”  
 Crude may fall this week after the restart of Enbridge’s
pipeline, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Twenty-four of 46
analysts, or 52 percent, forecast prices will decline through
Sept. 24. Seventeen respondents, or 37 percent, predicted little
change, and five estimated prices will rise. Last week, 55
percent said crude would decrease.  
 Crude gained as much as 0.5 percent earlier today after the
dollar dropped toward a five-week low against the euro,
increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  
 The dollar slipped to $1.3102 per euro from $1.3050 in New
York on Sept. 17, when it also touched $1.3159, the weakest
level since Aug. 11. The U.S. currency also weakened versus most
of its major counterparts on speculation the Federal Reserve
will tomorrow signal it is moving closer to taking further
measures to keep borrowing costs low.  
 Brent crude oil for November settlement gained as much as
44 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $78.65 on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract was at $78.25 a barrel.
