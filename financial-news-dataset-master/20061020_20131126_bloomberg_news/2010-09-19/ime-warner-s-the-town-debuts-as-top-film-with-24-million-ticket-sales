             “The Town” was the No. 1 movie in
U.S. and Canadian theaters this past weekend, earning $23.8
million in ticket sales for Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros.  
 The film beat out three other new releases, including
“Easy A” from Sony Corp., which was second with $17.7 million,
box-office tracker  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  
 Directed by actor  Ben Affleck , “The Town” is Time
Warner’s first No. 1 film since “Inception” in mid-July.
Warner Bros. leads all Hollywood studios in sales this year with
$1.23 billion as of Sept. 16, a 16 percent share of the market,
according to the website  Box Office Mojo .  
 “Affleck is looking to take a page from the  Clint Eastwood 
handbook,” said  Paul Dergarabedian , president of Hollywood.com
Box-Office. “Strong word-of-mouth likely (will) propel the film
well into the fall movie and awards season.”  
 “The Town,” the second full-length feature directed by
Affleck, stars  Jon Hamm  of “Mad Men” and Blake Lively of
“Gossip Girl,” along with Affleck, in a crime drama about a
gang of bank robbers in Boston.  
 “Easy A,” from Sony’s Screen Gems, features Emma Stone as
a high school student who relies on rumors spread by her peers
to advance her social status.  Amanda Bynes ,  Lisa Kudrow ,  Stanley Tucci  and  Patricia Clarkson  co-star in the romantic comedy.  
 ‘Devil’  
 “Devil,” also making its debut, was third with $12.3
million for Universal Pictures. The movie, co-written by  M. Night Shyamalan , features five office workers who are stranded
in an elevator and fear the devil may be among them.  
 Sony’s “Resident Evil: Afterlife” finished fourth with
$10 million in receipts. It’s the fourth film in the science-
fiction series and the first to be shot in 3-D.  Milla Jovovich 
stars as a zombie-fighting warrior in the movie, which is based
on the video game from Japan-based  Capcom Co.   
 The 3-D animated film “Alpha and Omega” made its debut in
fifth place for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. with $9.1
million. Two young wolves, voiced by  Justin Long  and Hayden
Panettiere, fall in love even though they are at opposite ends
of their pack’s social order.  
 ‘Wall Street’ Sequel  
 Next weekend, “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” the
sequel to  Oliver Stone ’s 1987 “Wall Street,” debuts.  Michael Douglas  returns as Gordon Gekko and Stone again directs.  Shia LaBeouf  plays a young Wall Street trader who joins forces with
Gekko, who has been released from prison, as they alert the
financial community to impending doom.  
 The 3-D animated film “Legend of the Guardians: The Owls
of Ga’Hoole” also debuts.  Helen Mirren ,  Geoffrey Rush  and
 Anthony LaPaglia  are among the actors who lend their voices to
an adaptation of the book series written by Kathryn Lasky.  
 Sales for the top 12 films this past weekend rose 0.1
percent to $87.3 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com Box-
Office said. Year-to-date receipts total $7.94 billion, up 3.9
percent from $7.64 billion. Attendance has fallen 1.7 percent
this year.
