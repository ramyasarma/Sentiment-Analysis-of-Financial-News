             Saudi shares gained the most in a
month after second-quarter earnings came in above analysts’
expectations and as U.S. and European stocks rose and crude oil
prices advanced.  
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker,  Al Rajhi Bank , the kingdom’s largest lender
by market value, and  Samba Financial Group  paced the rise, as
all 15 industry groups climbed. The  Tadawul All Share Index  rose
2.4 percent to 6,200.26, the highest level since June 28. The
gauge gained 0.4 percent last week.  
 “The market response is strong on the better-than-expected
second-quarter earnings,” said Younas Malick, senior economist
at the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah. “The results of 16
companies combined shows strong 21.4 percent net-earnings growth
during the January-June period.”  
 Saudi Basic, or  Sabic , soared 5.3 percent, the most since
May 29, to 89.5 riyals. Al Rajhi rose 2 percent to 76.5 riyals.
Samba increased 3.1 percent, the largest one-day gain in a
month, to 57.5 riyals.  
 Saudi Research & Marketing Group  surged 9.9 percent, the
most since April 2009, to 19.9 riyals. The newspaper publisher
said second-quarter profit increased to 35.3 million riyals
($9.4 million) from 10.7 million riyals in the year-earlier
period.  
 Saudi Arabian Mining Co.  rose 4.1 percent, the most in
almost six weeks, to 17.75 riyals. The state-owned metals
producer, known as Ma’aden, started a trial run of a phosphate
plant that will commence operations in the fourth quarter.  
 “The market is expected to continue dominated by the
earnings reports,” Malick said.  
 The rise of developed-nation stock markets over the Saudi
weekend helped boost domestic sentiment. “Oil prices at $76 and
a bounce in Western equity markets helped the better-than-
expected looking second-quarter results,”  John Sfakianakis ,
chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh, said.  
 Crude oil climbed 5.5 percent this week and closed at
$76.09 yesterday. Saudi Arabia holds a fifth of the world’s
proven oil reserves.  
 European stocks  surged this week by the most in a year as
concern about the economic recovery faded. The  Stoxx Europe 600
Index  rallied 5.4 percent this week, the biggest gain since July
last year.  
 U.S. stocks advanced amid optimism about earnings reports.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 5.4 percent, its biggest
weekly gain in a year.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
