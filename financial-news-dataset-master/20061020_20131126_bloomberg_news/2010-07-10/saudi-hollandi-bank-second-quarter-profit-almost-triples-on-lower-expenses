             Saudi Hollandi Bank , partly owned by
ABN Amro Holding NV, said second-quarter profit almost tripled
on lower operating expenses even as the bank’s lending and
investments declined.  
 Net income for the quarter ended June 30 advanced to
 250.5 million riyals ($66.8 million), from 90.6 million riyals
in the year-earlier period, the Riyadh-based bank said in a
statement on the  Saudi bourse  website today. That beat the
median estimate of  219.7 million  riyals from three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Saudi Hollandi’s  net income  increased because of “a
decline in operating expenses” during the first half, compared
with the same period last year, the bank said in the statement.
The bank decreased provisions for bad loans 94 percent in the
first quarter to 45.5 million riyals from the previous three
months, according to data posted on the Saudi bourse website in
April.  
 “Most of the banks started making provisions in the third
quarter of 2009,”  Murad Ansari , a Riyadh-based equity analyst
at EFG Hermes KSA, said today. Saudi Hollandi was “a little
early in the cycle, and started booking provisions in the second
quarter of 2009.”  
 Bank Al-Jazira , the smallest Saudi Arabian lender by market
value, said today second-quarter profit dropped on provisions
against bad loans, while  Riyad Bank  said quarterly profit fell.  
 ‘Very Positive’  
 Banks in the Arab world’s largest economy had been
reluctant to resume lending even after the central bank cut
interest rates and the government announced a $400 billion
spending program to restart the economy. Saudi Arabia’s economy
will grow 3.9 percent this year, according to Riyadh-based
Banque Saudi Fransi, compared with 0.2 percent in 2009.  
 “We are very positive on the Saudi banking sector,”
 Faisal Hasan , head of research at  Global Investment House KSCC ,
said from Kuwait on July 7. “We expect to see good growth, not
in this quarter, but in the medium term. Saudi Arabia is a big
economy, and the kind of projects that the government is doing
will require lending from the banking sector.”  
 Saudi Hollandi’s lending declined 11 percent to
 35.2 billion riyals in the first half, while investments fell
20 percent to 12.9 billion riyals, the bank said in the
statement. Assets dropped 14 percent to 59.5 billion riyals, and
deposits fell 15 percent to 44.1 billion riyals as of June 30.  
 Earnings per share for the sixth-month period ended June 30
were 1.45 riyals, compared with 1.13 riyals a share in the year-
earlier period, according to the bank’s statement.  
 The shares  gained  0.6 percent to 32.9 riyals in Riyadh
trading today, valuing the company at 10.9 billion riyals. The
stock has advanced 9.7 percent this year.
