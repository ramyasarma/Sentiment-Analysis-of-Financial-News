             Canada’s currency posted its first
advance in three weeks amid gains in equities and speculation
the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates after a report
showed job growth beat economists’ expectations fivefold.  
 The Canadian currency gained 2.8 percent since July 2 as
crude oil, Canada’s largest export, advanced 5.5 percent.
Trading in derivatives showed a higher probability of a quarter-
percentage point rise in the central bank’s policy rate on July
20. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 5.4 percent in its
largest weekly gain in a year.  
 “It’s difficult to find any technical or fundamental
reason to not own the currency,”  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at
online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto, said in an
e-mail, “whether it’s growth, the Bank of Canada’s attempt to
normalize rates somewhat or as a safer-haven proxy.” Popplewell
predicted the currency will exceed parity during the next month.  
 Canada’s dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated to C$1.0337 per U.S.
dollar yesterday in Toronto, the strongest closing level since
June 22. It was C$1.0624 on July 2. One Canadian dollar buys
96.74 U.S. cents.  
 The loonie advanced 2.1 percent to C$1.3069 per euro, and
rose 3.8 percent to 85.72 yen. The Canadian currency was the
third-best performer among its 16 most-traded counterparts after
the dollars of Australia and New Zealand.  
 ‘Hit Hard’  
 “Commodity currencies got hit very hard as the expectation
for U.S. and global growth was being recalibrated downwards,”
 Camilla Sutton , director of currency strategy at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, said by phone from Toronto. “The
market has priced that in and we’re still seeing strong numbers
from Canada. There’s still a strong overall case for a long
Canadian-dollar position.” A long position is a bet a currency
will rise.  
 Canadian government bonds slumped this week on reduced
demand for the safest and most liquid assets. The  10-year
security ’s yield climbed 13 basis points, the most this year, to
3.23 percent. It touched 3.26 percent yesterday, the highest
level since June 23. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 fell C$1.10 to C$102.30.  
 Employment rose by 93,200 jobs in June, following gains of
24,700 in May and April’s record 108,700, Statistics Canada said
yesterday in Ottawa. The jobless rate fell to 7.9 percent, the
lowest since January 2009, from 8.1 percent. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted 20,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate
of 8.1 percent, according to the median of 23 estimates.  
 “Once again, Statistics Canada has blown everyone out of
the water,” Popplewell said.  
 IMF View  
 The job market has been one of the strongest parts of a
Canadian recovery the International Monetary Fund says will lead
advanced economies this year. The Bank of Canada raised its key
 lending rate  from a record low 0.25 percent June 1 after the
economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized pace in the first
quarter. The bank said future moves depend on the balance of
domestic growth and an uneven global recovery.  
 Canada’s unexpectedly large job growth in June means the
country is the first in the Group of Seven to return employment
to levels last seen in October 2008 when the global slump began.  
 “What we see is an economy that is no longer in need of an
emergency setting for monetary policy,” said  David Tulk , senior
macro strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank in Toronto. “Expect
the Bank of Canada to take rates higher in two weeks.”  
 Central Bank  
 Traders raised bets the Bank of Canada, led by Governor
 Mark Carney , will tighten monetary policy at the next meeting on
July 20. Yields on December 2010 bankers’ acceptances, the most-
active contract, jumped 10 basis points, or 0.01 percentage
points, to 1.34 percent, the highest in two weeks.  
 So-called Bax contracts have settled an  average  of about 20
basis points above the central bank’s overnight target since
1992, Bloomberg data show. Hedge funds and money managers use
the contracts to hedge against interest-rate exposure and make
bets. The yield falls as the price rises.  
 The  chance  the Bank of Canada will raise its interest rate
to 0.75 percent at its July 20 decision rose to 96 percent
yesterday from 76 percent Thursday, according to a Credit Suisse
Group AG calculation derived from overnight index swaps.  
 “A lot of good news is priced into the Canadian dollar,”
said  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at TD Securities
Inc.
