             Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
largest mining company, referred to arbitration what it said are
Ivanhoe Mining Ltd.’s breaches of the companies’ so-called
private placement agreement.  
 The private placement agreement was reached in 2006 for the
development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. The
breaches were caused by Ivanhoe’s April 6 adoption of a
shareholders rights plan, Rio said late yesterday in a
statement.
