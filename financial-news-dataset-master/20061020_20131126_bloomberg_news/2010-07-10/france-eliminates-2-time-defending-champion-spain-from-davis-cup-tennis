             France defeated Spain in doubles to
knock the two-time defending champion out of the Davis Cup.  
 Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra beat Feliciano Lopez
and Fernando Verdasco 6-1, 6-1, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-5) to give
France a commanding 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Wimbledon
champion Rafael Nadal of Spain sat out the matches in Clermont-
Ferrand, France, to rest his sore knees.  
 France will play Argentina or Russia in the semifinals in
September. Argentina leads that series 2-1 after winning today’s
doubles in Moscow.  
 Serbia won its doubles match in straight sets to take a 2-1
lead in Croatia. The winner advances to face the Czech Republic
or Chile.
