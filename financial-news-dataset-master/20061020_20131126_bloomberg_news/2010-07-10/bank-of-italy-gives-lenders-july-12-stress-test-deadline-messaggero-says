             Italy’s central bank has set a July
12 deadline for the country’s largest lenders to submit their
stress test results,  Il Messaggero  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 The Bank of Italy told  UniCredit SpA ,  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ,
 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,  Banco Popolare SC  and
 Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  they must send answers on how
their balance sheets would withstand economic and sovereign-debt
shocks by the night of July 12, the Rome-based newspaper said.
