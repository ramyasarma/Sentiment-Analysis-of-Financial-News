             France’s Sylvain Chavanel retook the
lead in the Tour de France by winning today’s seventh stage.  
 Chavanel of the Quick Step team regained the leader’s
yellow jersey from Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara in the (103-
mile ride from Tournous to Station des Rousses. It was his
second stage win in this year’s race and gives him a 1 minute,
25 second-lead over Australian Cadel Evans of BMC Racing.  
 Spaniards Rafael Valls Ferri and Juan Manuel Garate
finished second and third today. Saxo Bank’s Cancellara was
84th, dropping to 58th place overall.  
 Defending champion Alberto Contador of Spain and seven-time
winner Lance Armstrong of the U.S. both finished in the peleton
today, almost two minutes behind Chavanel. Contador of the
Astana team is in sixth place and Team Radio Shack’s Armstrong
is 14th.
