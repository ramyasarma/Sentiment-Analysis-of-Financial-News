             Germany came from behind to beat
Uruguay 3-2 in the third-place game at the World Cup on  Sami Khedira ’s goal in the 82nd minute.  
 Thomas Mueller and Marcell Jansen also scored for Germany,
while Edinson Cavani and  Diego Forlan  had the Uruguay goals.
Forlan also hit the crossbar with a free kick in the final
seconds in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  
 Spain and the Netherlands meet in the final tomorrow in
Johannesburg with each seeking its first World Cup title.  
 Germany took the lead in the 19th minute when Mueller put in
the rebound after Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera could only
knock away  Bastian Schweinsteiger ’s long shot.  
 Uruguay pulled even nine minutes later after Schwinsteiger
lost the ball near midfield and Cavani ran onto Luis Suarez’s
pass in the area to slide a shot by  Hans Joerg Butt .  
 Forlan volleyed in a cross from Egidio Arevalo Rios to give
Uruguay a 2-1 lead in the 51st minute. Forlan and Mueller both
have five goals to tie Spain’s  David Villa  and  Wesley Sneijder 
of the Netherlands for the tournament lead.  
 Germany tied the game in the 56th minute when Jansen headed
in  Jerome Boateng ’s cross. Khedira scored the game-winning goal
with eight minutes left on a header after Uruguay was unable to
clear  Mesut Oezil ’s corner kick.  
 Forlan then banged his free kick from just outside the
penalty area off the crossbar and referee Benito Archundia blew
the final whistle.  
 Germany finished third for the second consecutive World Cup
and the fourth time overall.
