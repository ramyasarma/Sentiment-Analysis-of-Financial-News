             The Ras al-Zour port on the Persian
Gulf will start trial operations next month and receive its
first ship by the end of the year,  Al Watan  reported, citing
Khalid Al Mesfer, the public relations managing director for the
 Saudi Ports Authority .  
 The port is expected to handle 6 million tons of granular
diammonium phosphate, 440,000 tons of liquefied ammonia, one
million tons of caustic soda and one million tons of alumina per
year, the newspaper said.  
 The 2.2 billion riyal ($586.7 million) port may expand by
adding terminals for general cargo from northern and
northwestern Saudi Arabia, Al Watan said, citing Mesfer.
