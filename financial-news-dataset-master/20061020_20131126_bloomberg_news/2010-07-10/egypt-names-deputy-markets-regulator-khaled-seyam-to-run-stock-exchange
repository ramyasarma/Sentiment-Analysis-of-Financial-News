             Prime Minister  Ahmed Nazif  appointed
Khaled Seyam as chairman of the Egyptian Exchange, the
Investment Ministry said.  
 Seyam, who will replace  Maged Shawky , will take up the post
on July 15, the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.
Seyam is the deputy chairman of the  Egyptian Financial
Supervisory Authority , which regulates financial markets.  
 “It should have a neutral effect on the market,”  Ashraf Akhnoukh , a senior equity trader at CIBC brokerage in
Cairo, said by phone. “He will most likely carry on with the
same policies of his predecessor.”  
 Shawky, who has headed the exchange for five years, asked
to step down as of July 1, the ministry said in the statement.  
 The benchmark  EGX30  stock index gained 35 percent in 2009.
It has lost 2.9 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 During his tenure, Shawky oversaw the creation of the Nile
Stock Exchange for small- and medium-sized companies. He said in
March that the exchange was planning to introduce commodity-
related derivatives as part of plans to set up a market trading
raw materials in the longer term.
