             Former Business Secretary  Peter Mandelson  has caused a rift with  Tony Blair  in producing his
memoirs about the New Labour era before the former prime
minister’s own book is public, the Financial Times reported,
citing a friend of Blair.  
 Lord Mandelson’s book, The Third Man, will be published
next week, less than two months after Labour’s defeat, the FT
said. Blair, who expected to be the first to tell the story of
the Labour government, will publish his memoirs, The Journey, in
September, according to the FT.
