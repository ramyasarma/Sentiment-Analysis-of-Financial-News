             Saudi Arabian  inflation  accelerated
to a 13-month high in June as housing and food costs increased
in the largest Arab economy.  
 The inflation rate rose to 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent in
May, the government’s Central Department of Statistics said in
data posted on its website today. Consumer prices increased 0.3
percent from the previous month.  
 While inflation has been  accelerating  since late 2009, this
doesn’t warrant a “different course of action” in the
kingdom’s monetary policy, central bank Governor  Muhammad al- Jasser  said in May.  
 “Saudi inflation is mainly made up of food and housing-
related costs,”  Jarmo Kotilaine , the chief economist at NCB
Capital, said in a telephone interview today. “The housing
situation is bad, and it is a very tight market.”  
 Housing demand will reach about 2 million units by 2014,
Credit Suisse Group AG said in an April report. About 57 percent
of the country’s population is under the age of 20 and demand
will mainly come from low- and middle-income buyers.  
 Inflation across Gulf Arab states slowed last year from
2008 records as the financial crisis lowered housing costs and
food prices. Inflation in the kingdom eased to 5.1 percent in
2009 from 9.9 percent in 2008 as crude-oil prices fell from a
peak of almost $147 a barrel and the global economic crisis
crimped consumer demand.  
 Saudi Arabia’s central bank said last month it expects no
acute inflationary pressures in the second quarter. Inflation
slowed to a quarterly 1.1 percent in the January-March period,
from 1.5 percent in the final three months of 2009, it said.  
 The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency last year cut the
repurchase rate to 2 percent, the lowest since 2004, and the
reverse repurchase rate to 0.25 percent.
