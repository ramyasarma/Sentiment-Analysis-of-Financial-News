             The euro climbed to an eight-week
high against the dollar as European Central Bank President  Jean- Claude Trichet  said the economic recovery is gathering momentum.  
 The yen and dollar dropped this week against most of their
major counterparts as stocks rallied on evidence the world is
weathering Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, spurring demand for
riskier assets. Canada’s currency rose the most in almost a
month before the central bank’s policy meeting later in July as
job creation was almost five times what economists forecast.  
 “Risk sentiment is still quite constructive as we got
another week of equity market gains,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief
currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto.
“Trichet was quite upbeat in his comments this week, which gave
the euro a little more support.”  
 The euro appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2641 yesterday, from
$1.2566 on July 2. It touched $1.2722 yesterday, the highest
level since May 12. The euro rallied 1.6 percent to 112.01 yen,
from 110.27. The dollar advanced 1 percent to 88.62 yen, from
87.75 yen.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain dropped to 38,909 on July 6, compared with
record net shorts of 113,890 on May 11, figures from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed yesterday.  
 Canada’s currency  rallied 2.8 percent to C$1.0337 per U.S.
dollar after touching C$1.0296 yesterday, the strongest level
since June 23. It was the biggest five-day gain since June 11.  
 Canadian Hiring  
 Employers added 93,200 jobs in June following an increase
of 24,700 in the previous month, Statistics Canada said
yesterday. The median forecast of 23 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a gain of 20,000. The jobless rate fell to
7.9 percent.  
 Canada has restored most of its job losses since 2008,
bolstering the case for the central bank to raise borrowing
costs for a second month.  
 “It’s a great number, coming in way above expectations,”
said  Camilla Sutton , director of currency strategy at Bank of
Nova Scotia in Toronto. “It’s very good for the Canadian
dollar.”  
 The Bank of Canada increased its  target lending rate  to
0.50 percent from a record low 0.25 percent on June 1 after the
nation’s economy grew at a 6.1 percent annualized pace in the
first quarter. Policy makers meet again July 20.  
 Australia’s dollar advanced 5.3 percent to 77.76 yen and
the South African rand gained 1.8 percent to 7.60 against the
dollar as evidence of a global economic recovery reduced demand
for relative safety.  
 Yen as Haven  
 The yen typically strengthens in times of financial
uncertainty because Japan’s trade surplus frees the nation from
dependence on overseas capital. The dollar benefits as the
world’s main reserve currency.  
 The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for
global growth this year, reflecting a stronger-than-expected
first half, while warning that financial-market turmoil has
increased the risks to the recovery.  
 The world economy will expand 4.6 percent in 2010, the
biggest gain since 2007, compared with an April projection of
4.2 percent, the Washington-based IMF said in revisions this
week to its World Economic Outlook. Growth next year is
projected to be 4.3 percent, unchanged from the April forecast.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index each gained 5.4 percent.  
 The 16-nation currency advanced for a second consecutive
week as Trichet said at a press conference in Frankfurt on July
8 that “indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic
activity took place during the spring.” Inflation expectations
“remain firmly anchored,” he said.  
 ECB’s Rate  
 ECB policy makers held the main refinancing rate at a
record low 1 percent, as forecast by 55 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 The shared currency was supported this week on speculation
stress tests for European banks assumed smaller losses on Greek
bonds than some investors anticipated.  
 European regulators have told lenders their planned tests
may assume a loss of about 17 percent on Greek debt and 3
percent on Spanish bonds, according to two people briefed on the
talks. Credit markets are pricing in losses of about 60 percent
on Greek bonds should the government default.  
 The euro has dropped 16 percent against the dollar since
the beginning of December on concern Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will slow the economic recovery.  
 The Chinese yuan was little changed at 6.7730 against the
dollar after U.S. Treasury Department pledged on July 8 to
monitor what it called an “undervalued” currency in the next
three months, seeking signs that China is meeting commitments to
help rebalance the global economy.
