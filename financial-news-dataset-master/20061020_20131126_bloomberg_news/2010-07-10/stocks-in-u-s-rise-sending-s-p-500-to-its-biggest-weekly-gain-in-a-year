             U.S. stocks gained four straight
days, giving the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  the biggest weekly
rally in a year, as retailers eased concern about the economy
and the International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast.  
 Alcoa Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Bank of America Corp. rose
more than 9 percent after U.S. retail sales grew at the fastest
pace in four years and the IMF projected global economic growth
of 4.6 percent in 2010.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  surged 19
percent as BP Plc said it may capture all oil leaking from its
Gulf of Mexico beginning July 13.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  rose
16 percent after beating the average analyst sales forecast.  
 The S&P 500 rose 5.4 percent to 1,077.96 this week as its
10 main industries advanced at least 1.8 percent each. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  also had its biggest weekly gain since
July 2009, adding 511.55 points, or 5.3 percent, to 10,198.03.  
 “The concern in prior weeks was about the continued spread
of the economic crisis potentially pulling the U.S. into a
double-dip recession,” said  Eric Teal , who oversees about $4.5
billion as chief investment officer at First Citizens BancShares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina. “What we’re seeing from the
economic releases this week and in anticipation of good earnings
is that that’s an unlikely scenario.”  
 Stocks rebounded this week after sinking 16 percent between
April 23 and July 2, driven lower by concern that less spending
by indebted European nations will curb global growth.  Alcoa Inc. 
will become the first Dow company to post second-quarter results
on July 12. Profit for S&P 500 companies increased 34 percent in
the April-to-June period and will grow by the same amount in all
of 2010, according to the average analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Jobs Report  
 Alcoa, which is forecast to earn 11 cents a share, rallied
9.4 percent to $10.94 this week for the biggest weekly gain
since December. Caterpillar advanced 9.4 percent to $64.72 and
Bank of America climbed 9.2 percent to $15.11. Gains were fueled
by a U.S. Labor Department report showing the number of
Americans applying for jobless benefits decreased more than the
median economist forecast.  
 “You got a couple of catalysts from economic data,” said
 John Canally , a Boston-based economist at LPL Financial, which
oversees $285 billion. “Trading volumes have been low so any
positive catalyst would be felt, and we got a few this week.”  
 Fewer than 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. stock
exchanges yesterday, the lowest single-day level of the year.
Last week’s daily average of 8.2 billion compares with the 2010
mean of 9.48 billion.  
 Air Conditioning  
 U.S. retailers reported sales gains in June as record-high
temperatures on the East Coast pushed more shoppers into air-
conditioned malls. Abercrombie & Fitch shares had the biggest
rally of a  gauge  of 31 retailers on the S&P 500, surging 16
percent to $36.06, as sales at stores open at least a year rose
9 percent gain compared with a 2.9 percent estimated rise.  
 Sales at the second- and third-largest U.S. department
stores also topped estimates.  J.C. Penney Co. Inc.  jumped 10
percent to $23.36 and  Macy’s Inc.  gained 3.8 percent to $18.53.  
 Retailers whose sales trailed analysts’ estimates declined.
 Family Dollar Stores Inc.  fell 6.8 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $36.  Gap Inc.  fell 4.9 percent to $18.53  
 BP  rallied 16 percent to $34.05 after the company said it
may complete a relief well ahead of schedule that will help plug
the leak from its damaged well spewing as much as 60,000 barrels
of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico.  Anadarko Petroleum , the
Texas oil company that owns a 25 percent stake in BP’s well,
soared 19 percent, the most the in the S&P 500, to $45.41.  
 Raw Materials  
 Commodity stocks advanced this week as the S&P GSCI Total
Return Index of 24 raw materials had its biggest gain since
April.  
 AK Steel Holding Corp. , third-largest U.S. steelmaker,
climbed 14 percent to $13.38.  U.S. Steel Corp. , the largest
U.S.-based steelmaker, jumped 14 percent to $42.88.  Monsanto
Co. , the world’s largest seed maker, rose 10 percent to $51.21.  
 The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, dropped 17 percent to 24.98 this week. The
index, which measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the S&P 500, is down from this year’s
closing high of 45.79 on May 20.
