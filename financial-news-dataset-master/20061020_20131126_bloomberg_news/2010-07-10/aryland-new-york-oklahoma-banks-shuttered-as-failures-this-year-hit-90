             Regulators shut four banks with
$1.13 billion in combined assets, sending the number of  U.S.
failures  this year to 90.  
 Home National Bank of Blackwell, Oklahoma, was the largest
bank to be seized, with $644.5 million of assets, according to
statements on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s  website . The
closures cost the FDIC deposit-insurance fund $159.9 million.  
 Georgia, Illinois and Florida are among the states hardest
hit by the banking crisis. More than 27 lenders have failed in
each of those states since the beginning of 2009, according to
the FDIC. Three banks each in Maryland and New York have been
closed this year.  
 “The remaining shakeout will be geographically
concentrated and much more restricted to smaller institutions,”
said  Steve Reider , president of  Bancography , a consulting firm
based in Birmingham, Alabama. “I continue to think that
geography is destiny.”  
 In an interview yesterday, FDIC Chairman  Sheila Bair 
reiterated the agency’s forecast that 2010 will be the peak year
for bank failures after more than 230 closures since 2009 pushed
the agency’s deposit insurance fund into a deficit for the first
time since the 1990s. Bair spoke in an interview for Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt .”  
 The FDIC included 775 banks with $431 billion in assets on
the confidential list of problem lenders as of March 31, an
increase from 702 banks with $402.8 billion at the end of the
fourth quarter, the agency said in its quarterly banking report.  
 Bank Closures  
 Home National’s deposits were sold to Claremore, Oklahoma-
based RCB Bank for a 0.22 percent premium,  the FDIC said . RCB
picked up 15 branches and $560.7 million in deposits.  
 Baltimore’s Bay National Bank and its two branches were
shut, and will open as offices of Lutherville, Maryland-based
Bay Bank, the FDIC said. At the end of March, Bay National had
about $276 million in deposits and $282 million in assets.
Regulators also closed Baltimore-based Ideal Federal Savings
Bank and transferred accounts to M&T Bank Corp., which is acting
as paying agent, the FDIC said.  
 Port Chester, New York-based USA Bank was closed and sold
to New Century Bank of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, the FDIC said.
