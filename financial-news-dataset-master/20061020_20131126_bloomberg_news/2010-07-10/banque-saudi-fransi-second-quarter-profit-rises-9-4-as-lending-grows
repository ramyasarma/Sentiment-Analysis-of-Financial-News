             Banque Saudi Fransi , the Saudi
lender part-owned by Credit Agricole SA, said second-quarter
profit rose 9.4 percent as lending grew, helping an increase in
operating income.  
 Net income increased to 757 million riyals ($202 million),
from 692 million riyals a year earlier, the bank said in a
statement on the  Saudi bourse  website today. That beat the 711.3
million-riyal estimate of  four analysts .  
 Banks in the Arab world’s largest economy had been
reluctant to resume lending even after the central bank cut
interest rates and the government announced in late 2008 a $400
billion spending program to restart the economy. Lending to
businesses rose in May at the fastest pace in nine months,
indicating a gradual return of credit availability, the  Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency , said on its website on June 27.  
 Banque Saudi Fransi loans increased 1.2 percent to 82
billion riyals, while customer deposits rose 2.2 percent to 92
billion riyals, the bank said in the statement.  
 The shares gained 0.7 percent to 43.1 riyals in Riyadh,
giving the company a market value of 31.2 billion riyals. The
stock climbed 5.9 percent this year.
