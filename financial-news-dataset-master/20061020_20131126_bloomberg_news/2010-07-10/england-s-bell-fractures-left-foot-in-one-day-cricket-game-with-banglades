             England batsman Ian Bell broke a
bone in his left foot during today’s one-day cricket match
against Bangladesh in Bristol.  
 Bell landed awkwardly after leaping to attempt a catch in
the field in the 10th over. He left the game and X-rays revealed
a fracture of the fifth metatarsal, the England and Wales
Cricket Board said on its website.  
 Bell will be examined at the start of next week, but he’s
unlikely to be available for the four-match Test series against
Pakistan which begins July 29, the England board said.
