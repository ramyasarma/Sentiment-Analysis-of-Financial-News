             Stress tests on Italian banks will
show how much European sovereign debt they hold,  Corriere della
Sera  reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The Bank of Italy asked  UniCredit SpA ,  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ,
 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,  Banco Popolare SC  and
 Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  to report the amount of
government bonds they own as part of the assessment of their
ability to withstand a worsening economy, according to the
Italian newspaper.
