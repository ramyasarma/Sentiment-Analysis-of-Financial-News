             China’s foreign trade has recovered
to pre-crisis levels, Zheng Yuesheng, head of the statistics
department of the customs bureau, said in an interview on state
television today after the release of June export data.  
 The decline in the trade surplus in the first half of the
year shows that the country is moving towards more balanced
international payments, he said on CCTV’s noon news bulletin.
