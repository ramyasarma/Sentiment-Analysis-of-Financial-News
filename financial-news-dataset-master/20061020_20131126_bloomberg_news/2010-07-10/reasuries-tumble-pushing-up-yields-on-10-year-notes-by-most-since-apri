             Treasuries  fell for the first week
in a month, pushing 10-year yields up the most since April as
concern eased the U.S. will slide back into recession and the
government prepared to auction $69 billion of notes and bonds.  
 The 30-year bond yield rose above 4 percent and the 10-year
yield exceeded 3 percent for the first time this month as stocks
and commodities climbed, damping bonds’ haven appeal. A report
next week is forecast to show a U.S. retail sales decline slowed
last month, adding to data that showed unemployment claims down
and wholesale inventories up.  
 “We’re seeing a move toward riskier assets,” said  Guy Lebas , chief fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “There’s a feeling that
the pessimism was overdone.”  
 The 10-year note yield rose 8 basis points yesterday, the
most since the five days ended April 2, to 3.05 percent, from
2.98 percent on July 2, according to BGCantor Market Data. It
dropped to 2.8793 percent on July 1, the lowest level since
April 2009. The price of the 3.5 percent security due in May
2020 fell 23/32, or $7.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 23/32.  
 The  30-year bond  yield climbed 9 basis points to 4.04
percent. Two- and three-year note yields were little changed at
0.63 percent and 1.01 percent, respectively.  
 Bets Reversed  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-long position to a net-short position in two-year
note futures in the week ended July 6, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed yesterday. Short positions, or
bets prices will fall, outnumbered long positions by 34,266
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade. It was the first net-
short position since January 2009.  
 “Gauging a recovery is difficult,” said  William Larkin , a
fixed-income portfolio manager in Salem, Massachusetts, at Cabot
Money Management, which manages $500 million. “Things always
improve, but it’s the timing that’s the hard part.”  
 Labor Department data on July 8 showed initial
unemployment-benefit  claims  fell to 454,000 last week, more than
forecast, after a report July 2 showed payrolls dropped in June.
Commerce Department data yesterday showed inventories at U.S.
wholesalers rose in May for a fifth month. Retail sales declined
0.3 percent in June, after a 1.2 percent drop in May, according
to a Bloomberg News survey before a government report July 14.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rallied 5.4 percent for the
week, the biggest gain in a year. Crude oil for August delivery
climbed 5.5 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 “We’re on knife’s edge,” said  Christian Cooper , senior
rates trader in New York at Jefferies & Co., one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “There’s a
little bit of optimism, but we could go back to a concern about
a double-dip if we have consistent misses on earnings or a
surprise out of Europe.”  
 Fed Minutes  
 Fed policy makers on July 14 will release minutes of their
rate meeting last month. The central bank cited slowing
inflation in its June 23 policy statement while reaffirming it
foresees a “moderate” pace of growth. It said “financial
conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on
balance, largely reflecting developments from abroad” and held
the benchmark interest rate at a record low.  
 “We will be looking for any further signs of concern
around European sovereign-debt issues spilling over into the
U.S. economy,” among other things,  Joseph LaVorgna , New York-
based chief U.S. economist at primary dealer Deutsche Bank AG,
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  
 Inflation Bets Rise  
 Traders added the most to inflation bets in six weeks. The
 difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices, widened by 8 basis points to 1.84 percentage
points in the biggest increase since the week ended May 28.  
 The Treasury will auction $35 billion of three-year notes
on July 12, $21 billion of 10-year debt the following day and
$13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 14.  
 The U.S. attracted more bids than average at a record-tying
$12 billion auction of 10-year TIPS on July 8. The sale drew a
yield of 1.295 percent, and the bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.88, versus an average of 2.45 for the previous 10 sales.  
 Ten-year yields will increase to 3.37 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
banks and securities companies, with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weightings.  
 ‘Fed on Hold’  
 “While the longer end has traded weaker the last two days
on equity strength, there has been no reversal yet of the new
consensus for the Fed on hold into 2011,”  Jim Vogel , head of
agency-debt research at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee,
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  
 Traders reduced bets Fed policy makers will raise borrowing
costs by their December meeting, according to futures on the CME
Group Inc. exchange. The probability fell to 14 percent
yesterday, from 29 percent a month ago.  
 Treasuries returned 5.9 percent in the first six months of
2010, the most since 1995, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Investors snapped up government debt on
speculation efforts by European governments to cut spending
would slow global economic growth.
