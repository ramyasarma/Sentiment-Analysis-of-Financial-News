             Ex-British Prime Minister Gordon
Brown was “very badly served” by aides who held “unbridled
contempt” for his predecessor Tony Blair, the London-based
Times said, citing an interview with former Business Secretary
Peter Mandelson.  
 Mandelson says his political memoirs, being published next
week, recount his relationship with Brown through three phases,
pre-1994, 1994 to 2007 and 2007 to 2010. “And the middle
period, as I recount in the book, was awful,” Mandelson told
the newspaper.  
 “The unbridled contempt that some people around Gordon had
for Tony and those who worked for him was very destructive,”
Mandelson told the Times. “They were constantly winding him up.
Partly because that’s what they felt, partly because that’s what
they thought he wanted to hear.”
