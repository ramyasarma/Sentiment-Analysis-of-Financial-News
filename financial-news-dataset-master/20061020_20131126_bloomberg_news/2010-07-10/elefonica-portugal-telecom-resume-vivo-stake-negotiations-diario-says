             Telefonica SA and Portugal Telecom
SGPS SA were set to begin talks today on the Portuguese
company’s stake in Brazil’s biggest mobile-phone company, Diario
Economico reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The Portuguese government, which on June 30 vetoed the sale
of Portugal Telecom’s stake in Vivo Participacoes SA to Madrid-
based Telefonica, doesn’t want to rush the talks, which may last
until September or October, the newspaper said.
