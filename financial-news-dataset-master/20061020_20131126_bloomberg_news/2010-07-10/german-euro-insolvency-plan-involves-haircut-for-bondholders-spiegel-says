             Germany’s plan to allow the
“orderly insolvency” of indebted euro-area countries would
force bondholders to give up part of their claims,  Der Spiegel 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  
 The proposal, drafted by the German Finance and Justice
Ministries, calls for setting up a “Berlin Club” of
governments to oversee such insolvencies, the magazine reported
in an e-mailed advance copy of an article for its July 12
edition. Holders of sovereign bonds, while taking a so-called
haircut, would be guaranteed half the bond’s face value as an
incentive to take part in debt restructuring, Spiegel said.  
 German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government views the
threat of “orderly insolvency” as a way to keep investors and
euro-area governments from piling up excessive debt, wean debt-
stricken countries from bailouts and buttress the euro, the
weekly said.
