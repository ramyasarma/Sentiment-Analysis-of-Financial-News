             AT&T Inc. ’s U-Verse video customers
may lose access to “Mad Men” and other shows on AMC, WE TV and
IFC, when the networks’ distribution agreements with AT&T expire
next week.  
 AT&T intends to drop the channels if it doesn’t reach a new
fee agreement by midnight New York time July 14, Rainbow Media
Holdings LLC, the networks’ parent, said today in a statement.  
 The contract was originally due to expire on July 1, before
AT&T agreed to extend negotiations for 14 days with Jericho, New
York-based Rainbow Media, AT&T spokeswoman Mari Melguizo said. A
similar fee dispute between News Corp.’s Fox network and Time
Warner Cable Inc. threatened a blackout for 6 million cable
subscribers that would have prevented them from watching some
New Year’s Day football games.  
 Negotiations have reached an impasse, Melguizo said. “So
we’re starting to let our customers know that Rainbow may force
us to remove their channels from our lineup.”  
 AMC received 26 Emmy nominations yesterday for programs
including “Mad Men.” The season premiere of the show, which has
won best dramatic series for two straight years, is scheduled
for July 25.  
 Rainbow Media is a subsidiary of  Cablevision Systems Corp. ,
the New York area cable provider.  
 AT&T, based in Dallas, rose 26 cents to $24.83 today in New
York Stock Exchange  trading . The shares have lost 11 percent
this year.  Cablevision  gained 24 cents to $25.34.
