             Ocado Ltd.’s initial public share
offering at 200 pence to 275 pence per share is too high, the
Financial Times reported, citing  Richard Buxton , head of UK
equities at Schroders.  
 Schroders is one of several institutions that might shun
the offering at the proposed price, which would value the group
at 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion) to 1.3 billion pounds, the
FT said. The U.K. investor might be more interested at a
valuation between 500 million pounds and 600 million pounds, the
FT said, citing an interview with Buxton yesterday.
