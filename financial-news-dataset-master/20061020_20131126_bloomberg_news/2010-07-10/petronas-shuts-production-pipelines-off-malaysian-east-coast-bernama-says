             Petroliam Nasional Bhd. has shut
production pipelines at offshore platforms off the east coast of
the Malaysian peninsular to identify the source of an oily sheen
on the water, reported Bernama.  
 An oil slick was sighted near production facilities
operated by contractors Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd., ExxonMobil
Mobil Corp and Newfield Exploration Co., the newspaper said
yesterday, citing a statement from Petronas. The contractors
have cleaned up most of the sheen and are now monitoring the
situation, Bernama said.
