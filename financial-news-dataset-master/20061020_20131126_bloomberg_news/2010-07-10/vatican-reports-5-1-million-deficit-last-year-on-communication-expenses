             The Vatican reported a budget
deficit of 4.2 million euros ($5.1 million) last year as
expenses to fund its radio station and other media projects more
than offset revenue from investments and donations.  
 The  Holy See , the central administration for the Roman
Catholic Church, had revenue of 250.1 million euros and expenses
of 254.3 million euros, its press office said today in a
 statement . While the Vatican didn’t publish year-earlier figures
today, it reported a 2008 deficit of 911,500 euros in July 2009.  
 The Holy See relies on earnings from investments in stocks,
bonds and real estate to supplement donations from Catholics
around the world. Its main expenses last year related to
communication costs, including running the Vatican Radio, the
statement said. The Vatican, home to Pope Benedict XVI and
located across Rome’s Tiber River, has 2,762 employees.  
 While the Holy See benefited in the 1990s from booming
stock markets, it plunged into the red in 2003 and posted a
budget deficit in both 2007 and 2008.  
 Separately, the Vatican Governorate, the institution that
runs Vatican City and its support offices, had a deficit of 7.8
million euros last year. The global financial crisis weighed on
the results of the governorate, which doesn’t receive
contributions from the Holy See or other institutions, the
statement said.
