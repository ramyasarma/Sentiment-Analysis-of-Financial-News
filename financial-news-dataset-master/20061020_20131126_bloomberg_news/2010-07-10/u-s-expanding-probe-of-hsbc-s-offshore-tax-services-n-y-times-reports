             U.S. prosecutors are “ramping up”
their investigation of HSBC Holdings Plc and the offshore tax
services it offers to wealthy clients, the New York Times said,
citing unidentified people briefed on the matter.  
 Two American clients are turning over account details,
internal memos and names of bankers, the Times reported, citing
a person briefed on the matter. The Justice Department is
looking for “UBS-style numbers and UBS-style fact patterns,”
the Times quotes one of its sources as saying.  
 HSBC spokeswoman Juanita Gutierrez declined to comment to
the newspaper, saying the firm “does not condone tax evasion.”
