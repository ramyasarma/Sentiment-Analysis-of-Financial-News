             The breakup of the euro area would
save the 16-nation region from years of economic stagnation by
boosting weaker members’ competitiveness as well as domestic
demand in Germany to spark growth, Capital Economics said.  
 “The threatened breakup of the euro zone, which many see
as a potential disaster, would actually open the door to renewed
economic growth, not just for weaker members of the zone, but
for Europe as a whole,” Capital Economics analysts including
 Roger Bootle  in London said in a report released today.  
 Greece’s debt crisis has driven down the euro and forced
governments from Spain to Italy to embrace austerity measures
and cut their deficits, clouding the outlook for recovery from
the worst recession in six decades. The International Monetary
Fund on July 8 kept its forecast for 1 percent growth this year
in the region, which expanded 0.2 percent in the first quarter.  
 Europe’s weaker economies face “years of economic pain”
as they deflate costs and prices to regain competitiveness with
Germany, which runs a large trade surplus and restrains domestic
demand, Capital Economics said. Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal
and Greece could quickly narrow the competitiveness gap if they
returned to their own currencies, which would depreciate and
allow exports to expand, it said.  
 ‘Escape Route’  
 “This would offer them an escape route from their
difficulties through economic growth, rather than depression,”
the economists wrote.  
 A full abandonment of the euro would also help Germany as a
restored deutsche mark would appreciate and make the government
expand domestic demand to maintain jobs and growth, pushing up
the German standard of living, according to the report. That, in
turn, would further fuel imports from euro countries, helping to
rebalance Europe’s economy.  
 In a separate report on July 7 by ING Bank NV, economists
including  Mark Cliffe  in London said a euro-area breakup is
“thinkable, but unpalatable.” The region’s cumulative loss in
economic output in the first two years after a breakup would be
“close to 10 percent, dwarfing the fallout caused by the
collapse after the demise of Lehman Brothers in September
2008,” according to the report.
