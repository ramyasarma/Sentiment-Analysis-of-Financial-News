             The death toll in Mohmand Agency
rose after two bombs exploded yesterday, equaling the deadliest
guerrilla attack since January in Pakistan’s northwest.  
 The blasts killed 105 people and wounded 140 others, Miraj
Ali Khan, a local government official, said by telephone from
Mohmand today.  
 The Edhi Foundation ambulance service counted 85 people
killed and more than 150 injured, its provincial coordinator,
Mujahid Khan said yesterday.  
 Bombs built into a car and a motorcycle exploded yesterday
at Yaka Ghund, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the main
northwestern city of Peshawar. The bombs struck near the office
of Assistant Political Agent Rasul Khan, the government
administrator in the village, who has been organizing local
Mohmand tribesmen to fight the Taliban.  
 The attack is the biggest in the frontier region since a
Jan. 1 bomb killed 105 people.  
 Guerrillas  
 While Mohmand has been one of the calmer Pakistani regions
along the Afghan border, guerrillas have been gathering there
after fleeing the army’s latest offensive in the Orakzai Agency,
south of Peshawar, Malik Naweed, chief of police for Pakistan’s
northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, said yesterday.  
 Taliban guerrillas seized an army post on the Mohmand
frontier with Afghanistan on June 15, forcing scores of soldiers
to flee.  
 Taliban guerrillas claimed responsibility in February for a
series of bomb attacks that destroyed or damaged schools in
Mohmand and other tribal areas.
