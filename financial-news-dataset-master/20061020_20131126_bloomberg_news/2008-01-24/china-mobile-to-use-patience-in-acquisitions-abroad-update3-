             China Mobile Communications Corp.,
the parent of the world's most valuable phone company, will use
``patience'' in its overseas expansion plans as the carrier
focuses on winning clients in rural areas of its home market.  
 ``The problem now is that prices of phone companies in
 emerging markets  are too expensive,'' President  Wang Jianzhou 
said in an interview at the annual meeting of the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday. ``We're not in
a hurry, we have patience.''  
 The Beijing-based company, which has more customers than
the U.S. population, hasn't made any purchases abroad since
last year's $284 million  takeover  of  Pakistan 's Paktel Ltd.
Chinese mobile-phone users jumped 17 percent in the first 11
months in 2007, the second-fastest growth among major wireless
markets after  India , led by demand from smaller towns and
villages.  
 ``It's not in their interest to be all that aggressive if
there is nothing to buy and it's not their first priority,''
Jeffrey Tan, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group, said. ``There
is a lot of potential in the rural market where there is a low
penetration rate, as long as they can keep the costs down.''  
 China Mobile Communications owns almost 75 percent of Hong
Kong-listed  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , whose shares fell 3.5 percent to
close at HK$116.10 in Hong Kong. The stock has dropped 16
percent this year after doubling in 2007.  
 Tan rates shares of the world's biggest mobile-phone
company by users as ``outperform'' with a price estimate of
HK$153.  
 Rural Growth  
 China Mobile's $298 billion in market capitalization makes
it the world's most valuable phone company, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 The carrier added 68.1 million users in China last year
for a total of more than 369 million. Smaller rival China
Unicom Ltd. had about 160 million customers.  
 ``Growing in big cities has become more difficult,
therefore our focus is on mid- and small-sized cities and rural
areas,'' Wang said. ``Last year, more than 50 percent of new
users came from rural areas. This year it will still be the
case.''  
 China's government has urged local technology companies to
increase investments in African and Southeast Asian nations
that the country is deepening ties with. Wang said in April of
last year that China Mobile Communications planned to acquire
companies in  Africa  and Southeast Asia.  
 India, Kenya  
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world's largest carrier by revenue,
and France Telecom SA, Europe's third-largest phone company,
have made or announced takeovers from India to  Kenya  to help
boost revenue and offset slowing growth at home.  
 France Telecom, based in Paris, last month completed the
acquisition of a majority stake in Telkom Kenya Ltd. for $390
million. Vodafone spent $10.7 billion in May for a controlling
stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd., India's fourth-largest mobile-phone company.  
 ``If you pay too high a price for assets that don't add to
earnings, it's defeating the purpose,'' Wang said.  
 Vodafone, based in Newbury,  England , owns a 3.27 percent
stake in China Mobile, according to the  Web site  of the U.K.
company.  
 ``We have very good relations with Vodafone,'' Wang said.
``We haven't held discussions regarding their stake, either
about an increase or a decrease.''  
 China  Mobile Communications is still seeking to convert
existing stock held by the parent for a planned issue of yuan-denominated  shares  ``as soon as possible,'' Wang said,
reiterating earlier comments. He declined to provide a
timeframe.
