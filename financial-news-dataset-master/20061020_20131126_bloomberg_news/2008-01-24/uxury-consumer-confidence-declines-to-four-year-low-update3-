             Confidence among U.S. luxury
consumers fell to the lowest level in at least four years,
signaling a slowdown in spending in 2008, according to Unity
Marketing, a research firm.  
 Unity Marketing's Luxury Consumption Index fell almost 24
points, its biggest drop ever, to 63.6 for the fourth quarter,
the Stevens, Pennsylvania-based luxury-market research firm said
today. The measure stood at 87.3 in the third quarter, the
previous low for the four-year-old index.  
 Sentiment among wealthy consumers eroded as stock markets
slumped, and the index's decline points to reduced spending for
 luxury goods  this year, Unity Marketing President Pam Danziger
said in an interview. ``The index is predictive of what is going
to happen,'' she said.  
 Spending by the typical wealthy consumer was little changed
in the fourth quarter, at $12,159, compared with $12,142 in the
previous three months, because of holiday shopping, Danziger
said. The figures include expenditures on luxury goods and
services including fashion accessories, automobiles, and dining.  
 ``At Christmas, people have to buy things, there is more
reason to shop,'' Danziger said. ``When their stock portfolios
go down, that's when the luxury consumers feel the pain.''  
 The index is based on a mid-January survey of 1,300
consumers with an average income of $150,000. The measure uses a
January 2004 base of 100.  
 Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , the biggest U.S. luxury jeweler, fell 46
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $38.67 at 4 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading and has dropped 16 percent this year.
Luxury department-store chain Saks Inc. declined 30 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $17.10, and is down 18 percent in 2008. The 13-stock Bloomberg European Fashion Index rose 7.8 percent today
and has fallen 17 percent this year.
