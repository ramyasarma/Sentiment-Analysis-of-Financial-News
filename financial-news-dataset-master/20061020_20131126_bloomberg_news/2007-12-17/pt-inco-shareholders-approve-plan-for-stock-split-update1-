             PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO) ,
majority owned by  Brazil 's  Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , won
shareholders' approval to split its stock.  
 PT Inco, as the mining company is known, will offer 10
shares for each one held, President Director Arif Siregar said in
Jakarta today. The company plans to produce 165 million to 170
million pounds of nickel next year, the same as this year, he said.  
 The company's shares are the sixth-best performers on the
 LQ45 Index (LQ45)  of most widely-held stocks on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange over the past year. The stock has more than tripled to
94,100 rupiah over the past 12 months, boosted by high nickel
prices, outpacing the Jakarta Composite Index's 51 percent gain.  
 The split stock will start trade in mid-January, Indra Ginting, head of  investor relations , said.
