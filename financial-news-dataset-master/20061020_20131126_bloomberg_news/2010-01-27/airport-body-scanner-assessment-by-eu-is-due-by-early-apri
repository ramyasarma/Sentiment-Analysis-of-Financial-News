             The European Union will move closer
to deciding whether its airports should install body scanners to
fight terrorism by early April, when EU regulators aim to finish
a study on the effects on travelers’ privacy and health.  
 The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, is
evaluating the merits of using body-scanning equipment made by
such companies as the U.K.’s  Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  and New York-based
 L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)  Matthias Ruete, the
commission’s director general for transport, told EU lawmakers
today in Brussels that the assessment would be completed at the
end of March or in early April.  
 The 27-nation EU is seeking a common approach to the use of
body scanners after the failed terrorist attack on a Northwest
Airlines flight to  Detroit  from Amsterdam on Christmas Day. The
U.K. has conducted trials of such equipment and  France  said
earlier this month it would start testing the technology.  
 “There is a danger that member states go it alone,” Ruete
told the European Parliament’s transport committee today. The
study will be followed by commission consultations with
lawmakers and then draft rules by August, he said.
