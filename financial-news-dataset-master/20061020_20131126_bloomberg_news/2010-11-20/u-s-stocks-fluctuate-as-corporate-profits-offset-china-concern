U.S. stocks avoided a second
straight weekly drop as higher-than-expected corporate profits
and Caterpillar Inc.’s acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc.
outweighed concern over China’s decision to cool inflation.  Caterpillar , the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, jumped 3.6 percent this week for the biggest gain in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Salesforce.com Inc., the
fourth-best performer in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in
2010, surged 19 percent after its sales forecast beat estimates.
Urban Outfitters Inc. rallied 13 percent and Dell Inc. gained
3.5 percent after their profit topped projections.  The  S&P 500  gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,199.73 this
week after plunging 2.2 percent the week before. The index slid
1.6 percent on Nov. 16, the biggest drop since August, amid
concern that the debt crisis in Ireland and Greece is worsening
and Chinese inflation-fighting measures will stifle economic
growth. The  Dow  rose 10.97 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,203.55.  "From a domestic standpoint, the economy’s picking up,
employment’s improving and earnings are pretty good," said James
Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in
Philadelphia, which oversees $105 billion. "Things will be
choppy, but in a rising domestic environment."  The S&P 500 has advanced 5.1 percent since Sept. 30 as
third-quarter earnings surpassed analyst projections by 6.6
percent for the 457  companies  that have reported, Bloomberg data
show. It was the sixth straight period in which more than 70
percent of companies beat forecasts, the longest stretch since
at least 1993, according to Bloomberg.  Concern About China  Equities plunged Nov. 16 amid concern China’s efforts to
curb inflation will slow global growth. Benchmark indexes opened
lower yesterday after the People’s Bank of China ordered a 50
basis point increase in the amount of money that lenders must
set aside as reserves, two days after the cabinet announced
measures to tackle inflation.  Caterpillar  jumped 3.6 percent to $83.97. The world’s
largest maker of construction equipment agreed to buy Bucyrus
for $7.6 billion to add shovels and drills to its range of
mining machinery. Bucyrus rallied 28 percent to $89.20.  Salesforce.com  surged 19 percent to $136.74 for the biggest
gain in the S&P 500. The largest seller of online customer-
relationship management software forecast fourth-quarter sales
that exceeded analysts’ estimates after attracting about 28
percent more paying customers than a year earlier.  Urban Outfitters advanced 13 percent to $37.26. The
clothing retailer reported third-quarter earnings that beat the
average analyst projection on a 13 percent increase in sales.  Cheaper Parts  Dell  jumped 3.5 percent to $13.90. The third-largest
supplier of personal computers posted earnings that beat
analysts’ predictions. Dell benefited from cheaper prices for
parts and buoyant spending from companies that are updating
aging personal computers and servers.  Merck & Co. rose 1.8 percent to $35.33. An experimental
drug from the world’s second-largest drugmaker raised levels of
good cholesterol, slashed bad cholesterol and may have helped
patients avert heart complications, without the safety risks
that prompted Pfizer Inc. to abandon a similar product four
years ago.  PulteGroup Inc. plunged 13 percent to $6.50. The largest
U.S. homebuilder by revenue fell after builders in the U.S.
began work on fewer homes than forecast in October as the
industry remained mired near the depths reached during the
recession. Housing starts fell to a 519,000 annual rate, the
fewest since the record low in April 2009.  D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest homebuilder, lost 9
percent to $10.48. Home Depot Inc., the largest U.S. home-
improvement retailer, slipped 0.7 percent to $31.22.  Travelers Cos. slid 1.5 percent to $55.49. The insurer,
which held municipal debt valued at $41.4 billion at the end of
the third quarter, fell after a selloff in municipal bonds.
Investors withdrew the most in almost 19 years from open-end
U.S. municipal-bond funds in the week ended Nov. 17 as concern
increased that cities’ and states’ finances are deteriorating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
