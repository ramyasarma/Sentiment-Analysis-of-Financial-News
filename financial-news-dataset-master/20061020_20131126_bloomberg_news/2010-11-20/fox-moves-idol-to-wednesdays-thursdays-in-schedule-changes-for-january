News Corp. ’s Fox network is moving
“American Idol,” the most-watched show on TV, to Wednesday and
Thursday nights when the program returns in January as part of a
wider midseason schedule change.  The move lets Fox create a Tuesday night block of comedies
including “Glee” and “Raising Hope,” the Los Angeles-based
network said today in an e-mailed statement. “Idol” aired on
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings last season.  Fox is shaking up a lineup that has lost a fifth of its
core 18-to-49-year-old viewers this season, according to data
from Nielsen Co. “Idol,” which is entering its 10th season,
has enlisted Aerosmith rocker  Steven Tyler  and singer and
actress  Jennifer Lopez  as judges. It will be the first season
without  Simon Cowell , a judge known for his acerbic comments.  News Corp., controlled by Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch , fell 21 cents to $14.18 in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .
The Class A shares have gained 3.6 percent this year.  On Sundays, Fox is adding the animated show “Bob’s
Burgers” to a schedule that includes “Family Guy” and “The
Simpsons.” A new police drama, “The Chicago Code,” will air
on Mondays starting Feb. 7 after the medical drama “House,”
Fox said.  “Mixed Signals,” a relationship comedy, will air on
Tuesdays. Fox plans a workplace comedy tentatively called
“Breaking In” on Wednesdays. The network is also moving the
drama “Bones” to Thursday nights after “Idol,” Fox said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
