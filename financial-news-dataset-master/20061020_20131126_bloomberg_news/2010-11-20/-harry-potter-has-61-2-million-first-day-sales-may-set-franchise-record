Time Warner Inc. ’s “Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1” had sales of $61.2 million
its first day of release in U.S. and Canadian theaters,
Hollywood.com Box-Office said.  The seventh movie based on  J.K. Rowling ’s books is on track
to set an opening weekend record for the film franchise,
Hollywood.com said. “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,”
from 2005, holds the record at $102.3 million, the box-office
tracker said in an e-mail today.  Friday’s results “would be a great weekend for most
movies,” said  Paul Dergarabedian , president of Hollywood.com
Box-Office, in a telephone interview. “This is the beginning of
the end for the ‘Harry Potter’ franchise, and I think that’s
drawing more interest.”  Yesterday’s receipts put the movie at No. 5 in terms of
single-day sales. The record is held by “The Twilight Saga: New
Moon” with $72.7 million last November,  Hollywood.com  said.  Dergarabedian estimated the film would earn about $130
million in its opening weekend. The record for a three-day
weekend is $158.4 million, set in 2008 by Warner Bros.’ Batman
sequel “The Dark Knight,” according to Box Office Guru.  The franchise ends next July with “Deathly Hallows -- Part
2.”  “Deathly Hallows -- Part 1” may take in as much as $900
million in worldwide sales during its run in theaters, said
 Porter Bibb , an analyst with Mediatech Capital Partners in New
York. The film cost about $250 million to make, according to the
Internet Movie Database.  Time Warner, parent of Warner Bros., rose 25 cents to
$30.76 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
