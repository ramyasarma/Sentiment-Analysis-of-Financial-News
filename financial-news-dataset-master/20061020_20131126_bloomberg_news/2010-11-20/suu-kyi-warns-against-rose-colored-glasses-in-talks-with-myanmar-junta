Myanmar pro-democracy leader  Aung San Suu Kyi  said the U.S. shouldn’t engage with her country’s
military junta “wearing rose-colored glass.”  “I want them to be practical about it,” Suu Kyi told CNN
in an interview aired yesterday. “Not engaged in rose-colored
glasses but keeping your eyes open and alert.”  Suu Kyi was freed from seven years of house arrest on Nov.
13, six days after the country’s first election in 20 years
delivered a victory for a party backed by the military junta.
The release of the 65-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate may
trigger a review of U.S. and European  sanctions  against the
regime for human rights abuses, including the jailing of 2,100
political prisoners.  President Barack Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David
Cameron issued statements welcoming her release, with both
leaders calling it “long overdue.”  The junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party,
formed by Prime Minister Thein Sein, won the Nov. 7 election.
The ballot was the first in the country formerly known as Burma
since Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won a landslide
victory two decades ago in a result nullified by the junta. The
refusal to recognize her party’s victory led to economic
sanctions on the Southeast Asian nation of 53 million people.  Suu Kyi has been released two previous times since her
first arrest in 1989, only to be put under detention again, with
her latest stint starting in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
