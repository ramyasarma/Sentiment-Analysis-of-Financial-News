Pat Burns , who coached the New
Jersey Devils to the 2003 Stanley Cup Championship, died from
cancer yesterday at Maison Aube-Lumiere in Sherbrooke, Quebec,
the National Hockey League team said. He was 58.  Burns was a member of the team’s coaching staff for the
past eight seasons.  “Pat was a close friend to us all, while dedicating his
life to his family and to the game of hockey,”  Lou Lamoriello ,
president, chief executive officer and general manager of the
Devils, said in a statement. “Today, the hockey world has lost
a great friend and ambassador.”  Burns was head coach of the Devils from June 13, 2002, to
July 8, 2005, before stepping down due to personal reasons. He
became just the 11th person in NHL history to coach 1,000 games
Feb. 27, 2004, and became the ninth to reach the 500-win plateau
March 30, 2004.  He led the club to a 46-26-10 record the year the Devils
won the Stanley Cup title. He posted a career mark of 501-353-
165 in 1,019 NHL games coached.  “Just as they will remember Pat for his success as a coach,
hockey fans also will remember his humor, his honesty, his
humanity and his courage,” NHL Commissioner  Gary Bettman  said
in a statement.  Between 1997 and 2000, Burns led the Boston Bruins to two
Stanley Cup playoff spots. He also coached the Toronto Maple
Leafs to the conference championship after the 1992-93 and 1993-
94 seasons.  His first NHL coaching job was with the Montreal Canadiens
from 1988 to 1992, during which the team tallied two 41-win
seasons. In his first season, he led the team to the Stanley Cup
Finals.  Burns is survived by his wife, Line; a daughter, Maureen; a
son, Jason; a stepdaughter, Stephanie; a stepson, Maxime; and
one grandson, Samuel.  Funeral arrangements were yet to be completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
