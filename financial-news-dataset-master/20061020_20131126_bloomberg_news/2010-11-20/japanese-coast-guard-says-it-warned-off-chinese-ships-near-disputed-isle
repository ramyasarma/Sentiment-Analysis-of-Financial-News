Japan’s Coast  Guard  warned two
Chinese fishery patrol ships not to enter the nation’s
territorial waters after spotting them near one of the islands
disputed by the two nations.  The ships were seen by a Japanese patrol aircraft this
morning off Uotsuri Island, the agency said in a faxed statement.
They hadn’t crossed into Japanese territory as of 11 a.m., it
said. The sighting was earlier reported by Agence France-Presse.  Uotsuri is one of the uninhabited East China Sea islet
group, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese,
disputed between Japan and China. Tensions between Asia’s two
biggest economies increased after a Sept. 7 collision between a
Chinese fishing trawler and Japanese Coast Guard boats.  After the trawler collision, China cut off ministerial
talks and disrupted exports of rare earth metals such as cerium,
used in polishing glass for hard-disk drives and as a catalyst
to reduce car emissions.  One of the Chinese ships responded to the Japan Coast Guard
saying it was executing its lawful duty, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
