Canada’s dollar fell for a second
week against its U.S. counterpart as the biggest five-day
decrease in crude oil since August reduced demand for assets
related to economic growth.  The loonie declined versus most of its major counterparts
on concern a stalled recovery in the U.S., the nation’s biggest
trading partner, and a move by China to cap growth will
encourage the Bank of Canada to keep borrowing costs lower for a
longer period of time. Retail sales excluding autos rose in
Canada at a slower pace in September, a government report is
forecast by economists to show.  “The key thing is still the U.S. economic outlook, and it
still looks choppy,”  David Watt , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit, said by phone from
Toronto. “It’s not like the U.S. is going to hit escape
velocity anytime soon.”  The Canadian currency depreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0168
per U.S. dollar yesterday, from C$1.0123 on Nov. 12. One
Canadian dollar buys 98.35 U.S. cents. The loonie, as the
currency is known for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1
coin, touched C$1.0262 on Nov. 17, the weakest level since Oct
28. It slid 0.3 percent to C$1.3903 versus the euro.  The Bank of Canada will hold its policy rate at 1 percent
through the end of the second quarter, according to the median
forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey this month.
The median forecast in October was for the target to rise to
1.50 percent by then.  ‘Notable Shift’  “There’s been a pretty notable shift,”  Eric Lascelles ,
chief economics and rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s
TD Securities unit, said by phone from Toronto. “That the Bank
of Canada is perceived to be sitting on hold is not a helpful
thing for the currency.”  Canadian  retail sales  excluding autos increased 0.3 percent
in September after a 0.4 percent gain in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 19 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The report from Statistics Canada is scheduled to
be released Nov. 23.  A U.S. Labor Department report showed this week that
consumer prices excluding food and fuel increased 0.6 percent
last month from October 2009 in the smallest year-over-year gain
since at least 1958.  Builders began work on the fewest homes since a record low
reached in April 2009, the Commerce Department said. Canada
ships about two thirds of its exports to the U.S.  Global Outlook  The Canadian dollar weakened versus the greenback on the
prospect for a slowing global economy. China ordered banks to
set aside larger reserves for the second time in two weeks,
draining cash from the financial system to limit inflation and
asset-bubble risks in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Crude oil dropped 3.9 percent to $81.60 a barrel in the
biggest weekly drop since Aug. 13, when it dropped 6.6 percent.
The MSCI World Index of developed-world stock markets was little
changed after falling 2.2 percent in the previous week.  Canada’s 10-year bonds fell this week, pushing the  yield  up
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 3.15 percent. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020 dropped
C$1.11 to C$102.90. The yield touched 3.16 percent this week,
the highest level since Aug. 13.  The loonie is still headed for a 3.6 percent advance this
year versus the greenback, which has suffered against its major
counterparts as the Federal Reserve carries out quantitative
easing to spur growth. The Fed announced $600 billion in bond
purchases on Nov. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
