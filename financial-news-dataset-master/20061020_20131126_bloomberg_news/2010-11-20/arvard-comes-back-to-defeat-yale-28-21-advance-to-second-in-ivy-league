Gino Gordon scored two touchdowns
for Harvard University to rally the Crimson to a 28-21 victory
over Yale University in the 127th meeting of college football’s
second-oldest rivalry.  Yale, Harvard and Brown University are tied for second
place in the Ivy League with conference records of 5-2 behind
the University of Pennsylvania (9-1, 7-0 Ivy), which beat
Cornell University 31-7. Brown (6-4) defeated Columbia
University 38-16.  The Crimson had a 14-7 deficit at halftime at Harvard
Stadium in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Marco Iannuzzi returned a
kickoff 84 yards for Harvard 12 seconds into the second half
and Gordon added his touchdown for a 21-14 lead.  “This is a great football game,” said Harvard coach  Tim Murphy  in a televised interview. “We had two ‘oh, my goodness’
-- a turnover as our first fumble of the season and the second
a picked ball and got a penalty. We found a way to win.”  Alex Thomas rushed for two yards with just under six
minutes left in the first quarter to give Yale (7-3) a 7-0
lead. Gordon countered with a 1-yard rush for Harvard (7-3).  Thomas scored his second of three touchdowns with 13
seconds left in the half to give Yale the advantage. He ended
the Bulldogs’ scoring with a 1-yard plunge with three minutes,
15 seconds left in the game.  Nine Wins in 10  Gordon’s second touchdown with three minutes left in the
third quarter gave Harvard its first lead of the game at 21-14.
Gordon was injured and pulled from the game after a helmet-to-
helmet collision with Yale’s Jesse Reising, who was taken off
the field on a stretcher and transported to a trauma center.  “My understanding is that he’s fine,” said Yale coach
 Tom Williams  said. “It was a precautionary measure to take him
off the field on a stretcher, but when he left the field he had
movement in all his extremeties.”  Collier Winters connected with Alex Sarkisian for a 12-
yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter to seal
Harvard’s win. Winters completed 13 of 16 passing attempts for
124 yards.  Quarterback Patrick Witt completed 16 of 26 attempts for
190 yards and one interception for the New Haven, Connecticut,
school.  Harvard has won nine of the last 10 meetings, billed as
“The Game.” Yale, however, leads at 65-54-8 for the series,
which is second to Princeton-Rutgers that dates back to 1869.
The match-up is the third most-played rivalry behind Lehigh-
Lafayette at 146 games and Princeton-Yale at 133.  To contact the reporter on this story:
