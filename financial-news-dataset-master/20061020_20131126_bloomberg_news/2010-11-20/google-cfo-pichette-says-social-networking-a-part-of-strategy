Google Inc. , owner of the world’s
most popular Internet search site, will include social
networking in its strategy, Chief Financial Officer  Patrick Pichette  said.  “Everybody has to take in consideration social signals,
but it’s one of so many signals to make the right decision,”
Pichette said in a television interview with the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. aired today. “So yes, absolutely it will be
part of our strategy. Yes, it will be embedded in many of our
products.”  Chief Executive Officer  Eric Schmidt  said in September that
Google would add a layer of social-networking features to its
main products, prompting speculation it would challenge Facebook
Inc., which boasts more than 500 million users. Google said this
month it has no plans to develop a social-networking platform
and will instead focus on creating social applications.  Pichette discounted a suggestion that Facebook would be a
key competitor for Mountain View, California-based Google in the
future. The Internet and digital world is “exploding,” he
said, and social media is “one chapter of so many.”  Google said in October its third-quarter profit increased
as businesses spent more on advertising to attract online
consumers. The company is benefitting from increased spending on
search-based ads as it pursues opportunities in mobile
communications and display advertising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
