California , the largest U.S. issuer
of municipal debt, said individual investors ordered 84 percent
of $1 billion in tax-exempt municipal bonds it is offering.  Preliminary yields quoted to investors during the first of
two retail-sales days ranged from 1.9 percent in the 2013
maturity to 5.38 percent in the 2035 maturity, according to a
statement today from Treasurer  Bill Lockyer ’s office. Investors
ordered $838 million. California didn’t offer $450 million of
the bonds to individuals, according to the statement.  Retail sales will continue Nov. 22. Institutional
investors, such as insurance companies and mutual funds, will be
offered $450 million in securities that mature in 25 and 30
years on Nov. 23, when the final prices will be set. The sale is
the third for the most-populous U.S. state since Nov. 15. It
sold $10 billion of short-term notes this week, along with
$3.275 billion of taxable bonds.  “In just one day, we get more than 80 percent retail in
our $1 billion tax-exempt genera-obligation sale,”  Tom Dresslar , a Lockyer spokesman, said in a statement. “We’re not
struggling. We’re succeeding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
