Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said nations need an “enduring commitment” to
Afghanistan and that it will take some time to hand over control
to local military forces.  “Transition does need to be place by place and conditions
based,” Gillard said a news conference in Lisbon, where she is
attending  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  talks about the
strategy in Afghanistan. “I want to be very frank with people -
progress is being made, but for security to transition will take
some time yet.”  Completing the handover would let the U.S. and its partners
in the conflict, including Australia, withdraw their troops and
pass control to Afghan soldiers and police who are in training
or already leading some operations now. President  Barack Obama 
aims to begin, by July 2011, a drawdown of the 30,000 additional
U.S. soldiers he authorized last year. Australia  has  1,550
soldiers in Afghanistan.  Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  has said he aims to take full
control from coalition troops by 2014. Army General  David Petraeus , the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, has
stepped up military operations against the Taliban while
preparing a plan for beginning the transition next year,
including handing over some functions and possibly some areas to
Afghan control.  Australia hasn’t declined U.S. requests for more troops,
Defense Minister  Stephen Smith  said in an Australian
Broadcasting Corp. interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
