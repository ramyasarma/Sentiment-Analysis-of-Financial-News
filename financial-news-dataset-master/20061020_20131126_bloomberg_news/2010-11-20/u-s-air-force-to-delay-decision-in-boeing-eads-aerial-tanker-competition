The U.S. Air Force will delay until
early next year its decision on whether  Boeing Co.  or  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  wins a $35 billion contract to
build aerial refueling tankers, an official said.  A decision on the contract had been set for “this fall,”
and “there are certain aspects of the source selection that
have taken a little longer than we’ve anticipated,” Colonel Les
Kodlick, an Air Force spokesman, said in an interview yesterday.  “We expect the contract award to occur early next year,”
Kodlick said. He declined to say what parts of the process were
causing the delay.  Chicago-based Boeing and Paris- and Munich-based EADS each
submitted 8,000-page bids in July to build 179 aircraft to
replace 1950s-era tankers.  Two previous awards were canceled. The latest delay isn’t
related to the Pentagon’s release early this month, because of
“a clerical error,” of information to each company about the
other’s bid, Kodlick said.  Both companies immediately recognized the mistake and
informed Air Force contracting officers, Kodlick said. He
declined to provide details on the information that was
released.  Boeing isn’t commenting on the contract delay or the
information release, spokesman  William Barksdale  said in e-
mails. EADS spokesman James Darcy in e-mails declined to comment
on the delay or information release.  Senator  Patty Murray , a Democrat from Washington, where
Boeing builds aircraft, said in a statement she was “deeply
concerned by the Air Force’s mishandling of proprietary
information.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
