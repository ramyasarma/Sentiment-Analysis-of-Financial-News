Australia picked rookie Xavier
Doherty ahead of experienced spin bowler  Nathan Hauritz  for the
series-opening Ashes cricket Test against England in Brisbane.  Callum Ferguson, Usman Khawaja and Ryan Harris were the
other players trimmed from the initial 17-man roster named five
days ago, Cricket Australia said in an e-mailed statement today.
The best-of-five match series starts Nov. 25 in Brisbane.  The selection panel “believes the left-arm orthodox
variety Xavier Doherty provides against a predominantly right-
handed English middle order is the better option in this game,”
chairman of selectors  Andrew Hilditch  said in the statement.  The 13-man squad is: Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael
Clarke (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Xavier Doherty, Brad
Haddin, Mike Hussey, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mitchell Johnson, Simon
Katich, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Shane Watson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
