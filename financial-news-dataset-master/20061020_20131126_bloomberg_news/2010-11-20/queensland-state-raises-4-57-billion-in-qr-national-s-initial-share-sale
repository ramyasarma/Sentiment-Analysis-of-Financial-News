Queensland state sold shares of
Australian coal-train operator  QR National Ltd.  at A$2.55 each,
raising A$4.63 billion ($4.57 billion) for the state in the
nation’s second-biggest ever initial public offering.  The state government will keep a stake of as much as 40
percent in the company, it said in an e-mailed statement today.
The per-share price gives QR National an enterprise value of
A$6.7 billion, the state said. The shares start trading Nov. 22.  Queensland is targeting A$15 billion from asset sales to
replace lost revenue and regain its AAA credit rating. QR
National will test the appetite for new listings after Valemus
Ltd. scrapped a A$1.39 billion offer in July and shares of  Myer
Holdings Ltd. , which raised A$2.1 billion in 2009, trade below
the offer price.  “These proceeds will now be used to pay off debt and
establish a stronger balance sheet,” Premier  Anna Bligh  said in
the statement. “Now is the right time for QR National to be
backed by private investment.”  Queensland’s income from the transaction comprises A$4.05
billion in IPO proceeds, an A$80 million dividend from QR
National and A$500 million from a debt facility arranged by the
rail operator, Treasurer Andrew Fraser said today.  Retail investors bought 34 percent of the shares and
institutional investors 66 percent. Retail investors will
receive a 10 cent discount, meaning they pay A$2.45 a share.  ‘Relentless Campaign’  The A$2.55 price is near the bottom of an indicated range,
with the state government saying Oct. 11 it would sell the
shares at between A$2.50 and A$3 apiece.  The share sale had been subjected to negative “campaigns”
from fund managers, coal companies and rival Asciano Group,
Fraser said.  “There has been a relentless campaign here by many people
who’ve got vested interests to talk this price down,” he said.
Still, “what you’ve got is a transaction that’s been completed
just as we said it would.”  QR National will have an A$6.22 billion market value at
listing, according to the statement. Stock exchange operator  ASX
Ltd.  is valued at A$6.57 billion, while  Qantas Airways Ltd.  is
worth A$6.03 billion, according to Bloomberg data. The
Australian government sold one third of Telstra Corp. for A$14.3
billion in 1997, in the nation’s biggest public share sale.  Brisbane-based QR National  operates  700 locomotives, 16,000
wagons and 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) of track across
Australia, according to a share sale document.  Earnings Outlook  The company expects earnings to surge 75 percent in the
next two years as coal shipments rise and mining companies
expand projects in Western Australia state.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are set to increase 42 percent to A$894 million in
the 12 months ending June 2011, the company said in the IPO
prospectus on Oct. 11. Earnings may rise 23 percent in the
following year, the document showed.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch & Co. unit,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG are managing the QR
National offering.  QR National is the third of five assets the state is
selling after Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service
both removed Queensland from the top credit rating in 2009.  The government on Nov. 10 sold the Port of Brisbane,
Australia’s third-biggest container harbor, to a group led by
 Global Infrastructure Partners  and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority for A$2.1 billion. In June, it completed the sale of a
99-year lease to forest plantations for A$603 million.  The state has sent out requests for expressions of interest
in the Abbot Point coal terminal and is working to complete the
sale of a toll-road company by June, Treasurer  Andrew Fraser 
said in a Nov. 11 telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
