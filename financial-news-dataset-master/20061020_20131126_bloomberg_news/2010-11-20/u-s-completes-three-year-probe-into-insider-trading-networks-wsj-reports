The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and other federal officials are nearing the end of a
3-year investigation into possible insider-trading networks
including consultants, hedge-fund and mutual-fund traders and
investment bankers, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.   One of the focuses of the probe is whether Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. bankers divulged information about health-care
acquisitions and other transactions, the newspaper said.   First New York Securities LLC and Primary Global Research
LLC are also among companies included in the investigation,
according to the report.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment, the WSJ said. Primary
Global Research Chief Operating Officer Phani Kumar Saripella
declined to comment, the WSJ said.  An unidentified spokesman for First New York told the
Journal his company is one of more than 36 that have been asked
to provide information related to the investigation. The
spokesman said First New York stands behind its traders, systems
and policies and has cooperated with the probe.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
