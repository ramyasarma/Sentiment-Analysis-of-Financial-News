tie in Ivy League football.  Yale was leading 14-7 at half in the 127th meeting in
college football’s second-oldest rivalry. Yale leads the series
65-54-8, but has now lost nine of the last 10 meetings.  The teams are tied in the league, behind the University of
Pennsylvania.  The game between Princeton and Rutgers is the only series
that’s been played for longer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
