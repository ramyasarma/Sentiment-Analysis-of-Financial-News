             While I'm busy tallying the results from the  Disruptor of the Decade contest  — more than 3,000 people nominated close to 300 different organizations — I thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight an emerging disruption in India. 

 My colleague  Vijay Raju  went on a vacation in the last week of December that took him to the jungle areas on the border of the states of Kerala and Karnataka in India. He noticed a new advertising approach from many mobile operators that that made their advertisements even more ubiquitous than soft drink companies.  

 If a picture is worth 1,000 words, Vijay's excellent photo essay (which you can download either as a  PowerPoint  or a  PDF ) is worth a Stephen King novel (in length at least). 

 It's an interesting hidden disruption. Companies can use the approach to drive brand awareness in areas with low literacy and television penetration. Villagers can benefit by accessing an affordable way to upgrade their houses. 

 As my feet get more firmly settled in Asia (we're moving in the next couple of months), I hope to send more of these kinds of postcards. Thanks to Vijay for sharing his story!
