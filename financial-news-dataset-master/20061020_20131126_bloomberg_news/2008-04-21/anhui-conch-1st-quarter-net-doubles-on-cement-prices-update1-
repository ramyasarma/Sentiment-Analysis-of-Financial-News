             Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) ,  China 's
biggest maker of the construction material, said first-quarter
profit doubled after it increased prices.  
 Net income  based on mainland China accounting standards rose
to 449.6 million  yuan  ($64 million), or 0.27 yuan a share, from a
year earlier, company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. Sales rose 27.5 percent to 4.6 billion yuan. The
company didn't provide year-earlier figures.  
 Conch, based in eastern China's Anhui province, is investing
in new production lines to meet demand for cement need for
factories and other infrastructure in China. The company's
production capacity may increase 21 percent in the next three
years, and higher selling prices will offset rising costs
including power, according to KGI Securities Co.  
 ``The surge was mainly due to the expansion of production
capacity, increase in sales, improvement in the balance of supply
and demand in the market, and increase in average selling
prices,'' the company's statement said.  
 Anhui Conch's shares rose 1.2 percent to 52.11 yuan in
 Shanghai  today before the earnings were announced. The shares
have fallen 28 percent this year, compared with a 39 percent
decline in mainland China's benchmark CSI 300 Index.
