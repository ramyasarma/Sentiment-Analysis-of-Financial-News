             First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , the
Canadian miner of copper in Zambia and the  Democratic Republic  of
Congo, agreed to buy Scandinavian Minerals Ltd. for about C$281
million ($280 million) to add a nickel mine in Finland.  
 Scandinavian Minerals investors will receive C$9 in cash and
0.01 of a common share of First Quantum for each share they hold,
Vancouver-based First Quantum said today in a statement. The
offer values Scandinavian Minerals at 41 percent higher than its
April 18 closing price.  
 The transaction would give First Quantum full control of the
Kevitsa property in northern Finland, which has as much as 831
million metric tons of nickel-ore resources on an indicated and
inferred basis, according to Scandinavian Minerals' Web site.  
 ``This  acquisition  is consistent with our goal of
diversifying our assets geographically and across commodities,''
First Quantum Chief Executive Officer Philip Pascall said in
today's announcement. Kevitsa is ``one of the world's major
undeveloped sulphide nickel deposits and one of the largest
mineral discoveries in  Finland 's history,'' Pascall said.  
 The acquisition is expected to close before the end of the
second quarter, First Quantum said.  
 Scandinavian Minerals  rose  C$2.98, or 43 percent, to C$9.98
at 3:58 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. First Quantum rose 78
cents to C$90.14 at 4:10 p.m.
