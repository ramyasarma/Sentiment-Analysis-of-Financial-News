             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the
world's largest shipbuilder, led gains in shipyard stocks in
 South Korea  and  Singapore  trading on expectations of higher
first-quarter profit.  
 Hyundai Heavy advanced 5.5 percent, the most in a month, to
close at 367,500 won in Seoul. Its  Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. (010620)  unit,
the world's fourth-largest shipyard, climbed 7.1 percent to
226,500 won.  
 Shipyards are building vessels and offshore platforms at
higher prices on greater demand for fuel and transportation.
Global trade is forecast to expand 5.6 percent this year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said this month.  
 ``Higher ship prices mean earnings at shipyards will be very
good even with higher raw material costs,'' said Cho In Karp, an
analyst at Good Morning Shinhan Securities Co. in Seoul. ``Prices
have remained firm this year, easing concerns an economic
slowdown may result in fewer orders.''  
 He has an ``overweight'' rating on the South Korean
shipbuilding industry.  
 The price of a vessel able to carry 6,200 20-foot containers
reached $107 million at the end of March, from $106.5 million at
the end of last year, according to London-based  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world's largest shipbroker. The price of a 300,000-deadweight-ton
oil tanker rose to $152 million last month from $146 million last
year.  
 Cosco Corp. Singapore Ltd. (COS) , the shipbuilding and bulk
carrier unit of  China 's largest shipping line, gained 7.3 percent,
the biggest advance in almost a month, to S$3.24. The stock was
the best performer on the 30-member Straits Times Index.  
 Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) , the world's second-largest
shipbuilder, climbed 3 percent to 34,000 won.  Keppel Corp. (KEP) , the
world's largest maker of oil rigs, gained 3.5 percent to S$11.90
in Singapore.  Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , the world's second-largest
rig-maker, rose 3.3 percent to S$4.12.
