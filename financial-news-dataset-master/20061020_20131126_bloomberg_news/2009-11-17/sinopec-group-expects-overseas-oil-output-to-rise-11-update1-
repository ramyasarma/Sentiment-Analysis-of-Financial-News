             China  Petrochemical Corp. expects to
increase overseas crude oil production by at least 11 percent
this year as  Asia ’s largest refiner expands energy exploration
to meet fuel demand in the country.  
 Output from  oil fields  outside China will exceed 10 million
metric tons, compared with 9.01 million tons in 2008, the
company known as Sinopec Group said in a  statement  posted on its
Web site today, citing overseas exploration chief Zhou Yuqi.  
 State-controlled Sinopec Group gained reserves in Iraq’s
Kurdistan and West Africa after completing a C$8.3 billion ($7.9
billion) purchase of Swiss-based Addax Petroleum Corp. in August,
China’s biggest overseas takeover. The Beijing-based company
said today it has 47 overseas projects in 18 countries to date.  
 “Our overseas output will rise further in 2010, making the
overseas exploration unit a major force in boosting the upstream
presence” of Sinopec Group, Zhou said.  
 Hong Kong-listed unit  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  is
planning “rapid” overseas expansion to secure oil supplies
after profit reached a record and as the nation’s economic
recovery spurs fuel demand, Chairman Su Shulin said on Aug. 24.  
 Chinese energy companies have spent at least $13 billion on
overseas assets since December as they take advantage of lower
valuations caused by the global recession to meet energy demand
in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  
 China may use 8.3 million barrels of oil a day this year,
9.8 percent of the world’s oil use and 46 percent of Asia’s,
according to data from Paris-based  International Energy Agency .
