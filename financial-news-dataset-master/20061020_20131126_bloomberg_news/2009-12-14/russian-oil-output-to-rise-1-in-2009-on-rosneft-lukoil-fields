             Russia’s oil output is set to rise 1
percent this year, reversing last year’s decline, after OAO
Rosneft and OAO Lukoil started new fields.  
 Production will climb to 493 million tons of crude, from
488 million tons in 2008, Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  told
reporters outside Moscow today. Oil exports will probably
increase 1.8 percent to 247.4 million tons, he said.  
 New projects have helped counter declining production at
aging West Siberian fields. The Arctic Yuzhno-Khylchuyu deposit,
a venture between Lukoil and  ConocoPhillips (COP) , began output last
year, while Rosneft’s Vankor field came on stream in August.  
 Russian oil output fell 0.7 percent in 2008, prompting some
officials, including Lukoil’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer
 Leonid Fedun , to say production had already peaked.  
 Russian oil shipments overseas surpassed Saudi exports this
year for the first time since the  Soviet Union ’s collapse.
