             Sam Zell, the billionaire real-
estate developer, said he's had talks to acquire Tribune Co.
and, if successful, doesn't plan to sell its newspapers or
television stations.  
 ``My inclination would be to not break it up,'' Zell, 65,
said today in an interview. ``There's a lot of opportunity
there.'' He said the discussions are a month old.  
 Tribune, owner of the  Chicago  Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
television stations and the Chicago Cubs baseball team, put
itself up for sale six months ago after the stock fell 27
percent in three years. Tribune  directors  plan to decide by the
end of March whether to accept an offer or spin off television
assets.  
 A native of Chicago, where Tribune is based, Zell declined
to comment on a report by Barron's that he topped all offers
with a $13 billion bid for Tribune. Barron's cited an
unidentified person familiar with the auction.  
 Zell's bid would be funded with debt and as much as $300
million of his own money, Barron's reported. A proposal to use
an employee stock-option plan to acquire Tribune ``has been
received well by everyone,'' he said. Zell sold Equity Office
Properties Trust, the biggest U.S. office landlord, to private-
equity firm Blackstone Group LP last month for $39 billion.  
 Advertising and circulation declines have cut into
publishing revenue at most newspaper companies. At Tribune,
newspaper advertising dropped 3 percent in the fourth quarter
excluding an extra week. Circulation sales would have declined 6
percent at the company without the additional days. Zell said
he's not as pessimistic as most about the future of newspapers.  
 Optimistic Outlook  
 ``My interest in Tribune Co. reflects my own assessment of
the value of its assets,'' he said. ``I'm not quite as bearish
as most people about the print side of the business.''  
 Zell's proposal is competing with a bid by Los Angeles
billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad and another offer from the
Chandler family. The Chandlers control about 20 percent of
Tribune and had urged the company to sell.  
 Zell said he doesn't intend to influence newspapers'
editorial positions.  
 ``Our interest in Tribune has nothing to do with editorial
policy,'' he said. ``My interests are solely economic.''  
 In the 1990s, Zell and a Chicago investment banker bought
control of radio company Jacor Communications for about $79
million. When Clear Channel Communications Inc. bought Jacor for
$4.4 billion in 1999, the Zell/Chilmark Fund LP earned a profit
of more than $1 billion.  
 Past Success  
 ``We think we understand the media business, and we think,
under the right circumstances, this could be an attractive
investment for us,'' Zell said.  
 Shares of Tribune fell 22 cents to $30.33 at 4:02 p.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They have fallen 1.5
percent this year as interest from buyers has waned.  
 Separately, Zell said in the interview that he expects
rising demand for office and apartment rentals.  
 ``The apartment market is pretty strong,'' Zell said. ``In
the end, apartment occupancies are very much connected with
overall employment.''  
 Zell also owns stakes in the Chicago Bulls of the National
Association Basketball and the Chicago White Sox of Major League
Baseball.
