             Russian stocks climbed as investors
speculated  emerging markets  may benefit from the  Federal
Reserve 's shift on  interest rates . OAO Gazprom, OAO Unified
Energy System and OAO Lukoil led the advance.  
 The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 2.1 percent to 1680.09.
The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 2.3 percent to 1889.62.  
 The Fed left rates on hold yesterday and issued written
comments that economists interpreted as indicating borrowing
costs may be cut this year. A rate reduction would make stable
assets such as U.S. bonds less appealing and emerging-markets
stocks more attractive to investors.  
 ``If the interest-rate cycle reverses to ease liquidity,
then that's going to provide even more money for emerging markets
stocks,'' said Kirill Surikov, director of equity sales at  Alfa
Bank  in Moscow.  
 The Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets
Index rose 1.5 percent to 922.79, a fourth day of gains.  
 ``Given multiple danger zones globally, I think the
resilience of the market is taking a lot of people by surprise,''
Surikov said. ``There's a fair amount of cash on the sidelines
because people were expecting a mini-meltdown, but it hasn't
happened.''  
 Gazprom, Lukoil  
 Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, climbed 2.9
percent to 260.73 rubles. Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer,
rose 2.7 percent to 2,134 rubles. OAO Surgutneftegaz, the
country's fourth-largest oil producer, added 2.4 percent to
31.162 rubles.  
 Crude oil for May delivery today added $1.78, or 3 percent,
to $61.39 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  
 Unified Energy, Russia's national electricity holding,
gained 1.9 percent to 35.118 rubles. Managing Director Alexander
Chikunov outlined a timetable for UES to take some of its
generating units public by the end of 2007, Interfax reported.  
 OAO Concern Kalina, a top Russian perfume and cosmetics
producer, tumbled 6.5 percent to 1,100 rubles, the largest drop
in more than eight months. Profit fell 35 percent to $15.4
million in 2006 after Kalina bought a German cosmetics company
and moved its production facilities to the  Ural Mountains  in
Russia.  
 OAO Transneft (TRNFP) , Russia's crude-oil pipeline monopoly, rose
2.8 percent to 55,090 rubles. Russian Prime Minister  Mikhail Fradkov  wants Transneft to issue new common shares and swap them
for the state's 100 percent stake in OAO Transnefteprodukt, which
owns the country's oil-product pipelines, Vedomosti reported. The
transaction would merge Russia's crude-oil pipeline network with
the pipelines for refined oil products.  
 Sberbank  
 OAO Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, jumped 3.4 percent to
93,304 rubles, its biggest rise in a month. The state-controlled
bank sold 2.8 million shares in its stock sale, and almost none
of the investors who bid successfully for the new shares failed
to pay for them, Kommersant reported, citing a Sberbank source it
didn't identify.  
 Analysts had speculated that some bidders wouldn't pay for
their shares as Sberbank stock sank toward 89,000 rubles, which
was the offering price for the stock sale.
