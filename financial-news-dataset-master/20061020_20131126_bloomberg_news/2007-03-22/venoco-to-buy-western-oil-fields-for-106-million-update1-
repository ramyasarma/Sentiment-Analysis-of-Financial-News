             Venoco Inc., an oil and gas
exploration and production company, plans to buy  Texas  and
California oil fields for about $106 million to increase the
company's 2007 average daily production by about 500 barrels.  
 The company plans to return idle wells to production at the
Manvel field in Brazoria County, Texas, and intends to reach
offshore oil from wells on land in the West Montalvo field in
Ventura County, California, the Denver-based company said today
in a statement.  
 Mike Edwards, a company vice president, declined to identify
the sellers in a telephone interview today. The purchase will add
about 9.7 million barrels worth of proved reserves to Venoco's
portfolio, the company said in its statement. Venoco has been
producing oil in California since 1994 and in Texas for almost 10
years, Edwards said.  
 The company's stock rose 96 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $16.48
today in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 3.1 percent since they were first sold to the
public in November.
