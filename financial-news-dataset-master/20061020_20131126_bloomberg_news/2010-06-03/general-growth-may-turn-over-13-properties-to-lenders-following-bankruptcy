             General Growth Properties Inc. , the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., said it expects to file
its Chapter 11 reorganization plan on or around July 9.  
 The Chicago-based company today also filed a request in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York to extend its exclusive right
to file a plan to Oct. 18, and to extend the period in which it
will solicit acceptances of its plan through Dec. 16. The
current dates are scheduled to expire July 15 and Sept. 15,
respectively, the company said in a statement distributed today
by Business Wire.  
 General Growth said the requested extension is part of a
strategy to “maximize value upon emergence” from bankruptcy,
allowing it to “explore all financing emergence options
available to it” and “complement or replace existing financing
commitments,” according to the statement.  
 General Growth filed the biggest U.S. real estate
bankruptcy in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt by
making acquisitions. The company was at the center of a takeover
battle between  Simon Property Group Inc. , a larger rival, and a
group led by Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  
 Simon withdrew its offer on May 7, the same day a
bankruptcy judge approved a plan for General Growth to emerge
with investments by Brookfield and its partners.  
 David Keating , a General Growth spokesman, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment after regular business
hours.  
 The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
