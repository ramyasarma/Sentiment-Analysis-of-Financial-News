             Growth in Europe’s  services and
manufacturing   industries  slowed for a second month in June,
adding to indications the recovery is losing momentum.  
 A  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 56 from 56.4 in May, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today. That’s in line with an
initial estimate published on June 23. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  
 The European economy is showing signs of weakening after
Greece’s fiscal crisis undermined investor confidence and forced
governments to step up austerity measures. In Germany, the
region’s largest economy,  investor confidence  plunged in June
and U.K.  services growth  also weakened in June.  Volkswagen AG ,
Europe’s largest carmaker, is among companies that have relied
on faster-growing markets including China to boost sales.  
 “The indicator will continue to weaken over the coming
months,” said  Christoph Weil , a senior economist at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt. “It’s a bit of normalization in growth. The
second half will  definitely be weaker  than the first, but we’re
still far from a double-dip recession.”  
 An  index of services  in the euro region fell to 55.5 from
56.2, today’s report showed. A gauge of euro-area  manufacturing 
declined to 55.6 from 55.8 in the previous month, Markit said on
July 1.  
 The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
report, trading at $1.2547 at 10:45 a.m. in Frankfurt. The
single currency has shed 12 percent against the dollar this year
on concern that a debt crisis will spread across the region.
