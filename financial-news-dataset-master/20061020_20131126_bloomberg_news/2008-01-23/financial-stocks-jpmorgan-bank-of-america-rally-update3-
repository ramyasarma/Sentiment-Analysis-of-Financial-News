             Financial stocks staged their biggest
 rally  since 2002 on speculation the  Federal Reserve 's largest
interest rate cut in 23 years will bolster earnings at banks,
brokerages and insurers.  
 Bank of America Corp.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. lenders by market value, rallied after Bear Stearns Cos.
advised buying shares of large banks.  Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) 
climbed the most in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index after New
York State's insurance regulators met with banks to discuss
raising new capital for bond insurers.  
 Financial companies posted the biggest  gains  among 10
industries in the  S&P 500  as the benchmark for U.S. equities
 rallied  for the first time in six days. The S&P 500 Financials
Index  rose  6.8 percent, bringing its two-day advance to 9.2
percent since the Fed cut its target rate for overnight loans by
0.75 percentage point, its first emergency reduction since 2001.  
 Eighty-seven of 92 companies in the S&P 500 financial index
increased. The gauge remains 27 percent below its record high on
Feb. 20.  
 The Fed move ``is a good sign and that's giving some
investors courage to tiptoe back in,'' said  Keith Wirtz , who
oversees about $22 billion as chief investment officer of Fifth
Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. ``The group is so out of
favor, it's almost like a spring that's been coiled tightly. When
a rotation starts to occur, that coil will relax and you'll see
these stocks up substantially.''  
 Bear Stearns Upgrade  
 JPMorgan climbed $4.86, or 12 percent, to $45.72, its
biggest rally since July 2002. The stock is 14 percent below its
2007 high of $53.20.  
 Bank of America added $3.18, or 8.5 percent, to $40.57, its
largest gain in eight years. The company said it plans to raise
$6 billion by selling preferred shares.  
 Bear Stearns analyst  David Hilder  upgraded banks to ``market
overweight'' from ``market underweight,'' saying that lenders
have historically outperformed during ``aggressive'' Fed easing
cycles.  
 ``In looking back at bank stock relative performance in the
1990 recession, it is clear that the trigger for bank-stock
outperformance was the beginning of more aggressive Fed easing,''
Hilder wrote in a note to investors today. ``We believe
additional downside in bank stocks is limited.''  
 Hilder's top picks were JPMorgan and  Bank of New York Mellon
Corp.  He said the companies would benefit from lower exposure to
bad real estate loans than their rivals. Bank of New York, the
world's largest custodian of financial assets, rose $1.18 to
$46.23.  
 Profit Outlook  
 Financial company profits may rise 28 percent this year, the
average estimate of analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. The
group's earnings probably fell 26 percent in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Ambac, which was stripped of its top AAA grade by  Fitch
Ratings  this month, gained $5.73, or 72 percent, to $13.70. Talks
in New York with the unnamed banks are part of Insurance
Superintendent  Eric Dinallo 's effort to stabilize the bond
guarantors and bolster the market's financial condition, said
agency spokesman Andrew Mais in an interview. MBIA Inc., the
biggest bond insurer, added $4.08 to $16.61.  
 Financial stocks  in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 21
percent last year for their biggest decline since 1990. The index
trades for 11.5 times estimated profit over the next 12 months,
compared with 13.6 times historical profits at this time last
year.  
 Yesterday's  reduction  by the Fed was the biggest since
October 1984, when the central bank lowered rates by 1.75
percentage point. The Fed began using target overnight lending
rate as the principal tool of monetary policy around 1990.
