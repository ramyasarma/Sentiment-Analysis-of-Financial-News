             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce  fell to its
lowest since Aug. 31 in  Sao Paulo  stock exchange trading on
speculation it will sell $20 billion or more in stock to fund a bid
for coal and copper producer  Xstrata Plc. (XTA) , diluting share value.  
 Vale, the world's biggest iron ore miner, slid 2.64 reais, or
6.1 percent, to 40.61 reais. The shares have tumbled 26 percent
from their Oct. 29 high of 55 reais.  
 ``Investors are reacting to the expectation of a huge offering
of Vale shares to finance a possible Xstrata acquisition, with the
amount ranging from $20 billion to $30 billion,'' said Guilherme Figueiredo, who oversees $600 million in assets at M. Safra & Co.
in Sao Paulo. ``This would boost the supply of shares, creating an
overhang.''  
 HSBC Holdings Plc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. were
appointed as advisers in a potential bid for Xstrata, according to
disclosure statements distributed by Hugin and CIS. The Rio de
Janeiro-based iron-ore producer on Jan. 21 confirmed it was in
talks to buy Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata. A spokesman declined
to elaborate today.  
 UBS AG cut its price estimate for Vale's voting shares to $40
from $42 per American depositary receipt.  
 ``We believe an eventual acquisition of Xstrata does add size
to Vale, but would dilute the higher quality iron ore and nickel
businesses they have today due to the relative lower quality of
Xstrata assets compared to Vale's portfolio,'' UBS analyst Edmo Chagas wrote in a note to clients today.  
 The transaction may ``stretch the company's finances under
challenging market conditions,'' he wrote. A purchase of this size
would entail ``complex deal structure that would involve issuance
of both debt and equity.''
