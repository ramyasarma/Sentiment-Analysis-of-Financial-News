National Aluminium Co. , India’s
second-biggest producer of the metal, posted a 41 percent
increase in second-quarter profit, aided by higher prices and
production of the metal.  Net income  climbed to 2.24 billion rupees ($50.3 million)
in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 1.59 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Bhubaneswar, India-based company said today in
a statement. Sales rose 21 percent to 14.5 billion rupees.  The average price of the lightweight metal, used to build
aircraft, cars and power plants, on the London Metal Exchange
gained 15 percent in the quarter from a year earlier. Input
costs, mainly electricity expenses, surged as coal prices rose
31 percent to an average $94 a metric ton in the quarter,
according to researcher McCloskey Group Ltd.  Production in the six months ended Sept. 30 rose 6.8
percent to 221,963 metric tons, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Metal sales increased 9.2 percent to 217,136
tons, it said.  National Aluminium  shares  fell 2.8 percent to 401.30 rupees
