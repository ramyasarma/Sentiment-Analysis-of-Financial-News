Dubai police said the parcel from
Yemen intercepted and defused at a FedEx Corp. facility in the
Persian Gulf emirate was similar to an Al-Qaeda bomb, the WAM
news agency reported.  The parcel included a computer printer with explosive
materials hidden inside the ink cartridge and an electric
circuit connected to a mobile phone’s SIM card, the emirate’s
official news agency said, citing a statement from Dubai police.  “The targeting manner carries characteristics similar to
methods previously carried out by terrorist organizations like
Al-Qaeda,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
