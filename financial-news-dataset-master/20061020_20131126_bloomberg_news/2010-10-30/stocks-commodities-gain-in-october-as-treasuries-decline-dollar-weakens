Stocks and commodities rose in
October, Treasuries fell for the first time since March and the
dollar weakened to a 15-year low against the yen as investors
bet the Federal Reserve will act to boost growth and corporate
earnings topped estimates.  The MSCI World Index of shares in developed nations gained
3.7 percent, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 2.8
percent. The Thomson Reuters/CRB Index of commodities climbed to
a two-year high as cotton, corn, soybeans and gold rallied.
Treasuries lost 0.4 percent, Bank of America Corp. indexes
showed. The dollar sank to 80.39 yen, falling for a sixth
straight month in the longest losing streak since January 2004.  Fed policy makers meet Nov. 2-3 to consider stimulating the
world’s largest economy through an asset-purchase technique
known as quantitative easing. Central bankers are concerned that
growth is too slow to curb U.S. unemployment that’s stuck near
the 26-year high reached in October 2009. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index built on its biggest September rally since 1939 as
more than 70 percent of companies beat profit forecasts for the
sixth straight quarter, the longest stretch since at least 1993.  “The Fed is trying to shove money out the risk spectrum,
and I think it’s happening,” said  William Greiner , chief
investment officer at Scout Investment Advisors in Kansas City,
which manages $9.5 billion. “Business people are starting to get
the sense that a double-dip recession is not going to happen for
the time being. It wasn’t more than 90 days ago that people were
really concerned.”  Querying Dealers  The central bank has asked bond dealers and investors for
projections of central bank asset purchases over the next six
months as it seeks to gauge the possible impact of new efforts
to spur growth. The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at
between zero percent and 0.25 percent since December 2008 and
bought $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed assets.  Estimates for the size of the Fed’s next round of asset
purchases range from $1 trillion at Bank of America to $2
trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at both firms
agree the Fed may start by announcing a $500 billion plan.  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing in five
years were sold at a negative yield for the first time ever at a
U.S. debt auction in October, signaling bets that Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  will be successful in preventing deflation and
the risk of another recession.  Thinking About Inflation  The yield “certainly suggests investors are starting to
think about inflation as a concern,” said  Sandy Lincoln , chief
investment strategist at M&I Investment Management Corp. in
Milwaukee, which oversees about $30 billion.  The Oct. 25 sale of $10 billion of the securities drew a
yield of negative 0.55 percent, matching the average forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey of 7 of the Fed’s 18 primary dealers.  Surging asset prices helped spur debt and equity offerings.  Sales of junk bonds in the U.S. set a record for October as
returns topped investment-grade debt and more borrowers were
raised than cut.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.  and  Calpine Corp.  led
speculative-grade companies issuing $33 billion of debt this
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes have
gained 2.32 percent on average in October, compared with a loss
of 0.16 percent for high-grade securities, Bank of America index
data show. Not since March have high-yield, high-risk securities
outperformed by such a wide margin.  IPOs Surge  October was the busiest month for U.S. initial public
offerings in almost three years. Hong Kong-based greenhouse
vegetable producer  Le Gaga Holdings Ltd.  completed the month’s
21st IPO, the most since 22 in December 2007, according to data
from Bloomberg and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  AIA Group Ltd. , offered last week by  American International
Group Inc.  in a $20.5 billion IPO in Hong Kong, had the biggest
initial public offering in the city’s history.  TGLT SA , an
Argentine real-estate developer, completed the first IPO in
Buenos Aires in more than two years yesterday.  “The market manages to consistently catch most people off
guard,” said  Eric Mintz , who helps oversee $3.3 billion at Eagle
Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Florida. “The consensus
heading into September and October was for a continued
correction as we had seen in August. The gains clearly surprised
a lot of investors as the liquidity in the market is pushing up
asset prices across the board.”  Beating Estimates  The gain in equities followed companies from Alcoa Inc. to
Google Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  beating  the average analyst
profit estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
S&P 500 climbed 3.7 percent during the month and reached
1,185.64 on Oct. 26, the highest level since May 3.  King Pharmaceuticals Inc.  soared 42 percent, the biggest
October advance in the S&P 500, after Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy
the maker of abuse-resistant narcotics for $3.6 billion. Walt
Disney Co., the owner of amusement parks as well as television
networks ABC and ESPN, rallied 9.1 percent to lead gains in the
30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Cotton futures surged 23 percent to $1.2526 a pound in New
York, the biggest monthly advance since June 2007, amid concern
the weather may have damaged crops in China, the world’s biggest
user. The fiber rose to a record $1.305 on Oct. 26.  Corn futures rose 17 percent, the most since June 2008, to
$5.82 a bushel in Chicago as speculation mounted that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture may cut its output estimate for the
domestic crop again.  More Imports  Soybean futures jumped 12 percent, the most since May 2009,
to $12.36 a bushel as China, the biggest buyer, boosted imports.
October marked the fourth straight monthly gain, the longest
streak since February 2008. Contracts reached a 25-month high of
$12.4875 on Oct. 28.  Gold gained 3.7 percent to $1,357.60 an ounce in October,
its third straight monthly gain, and touched a record $1,388.10
on Oct. 14. Silver surged 13 percent.  Crude oil for December delivery rose 1.8 percent to $81.43
a barrel in New York, adding to September’s 11 percent rally.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 2.60 and increased 30 basis points to
3.98 for 30-year bonds.  The dollar weakened against 14 of 16 of its most-traded
peers this month, dropping 2.3 percent to $1.3947 per euro and
3.9 percent to 80.40 yen. The Dollar Index, which measures the
U.S. currency against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar,
Swedish krona and Swiss franc, sank 2.1 percent to 77.04.  “The fear of a currency devaluation led investors to lock
into something that could restore their wealth,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati. “With commodities and stocks going up,
that’s not a good environment” for Treasuries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
