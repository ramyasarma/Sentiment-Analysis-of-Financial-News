Australia beat New Zealand 26-24 in
Hong Kong today in the final game of the four-match Bledisloe
Cup competition.  The last time the Australians beat the All Blacks was in
July 2008.  The Wallabies, second in the International Rugby Board’s
ranking behind the All Blacks, ended a 15-match winning streak
by the New Zealanders. The match, the third time the teams have
met at a neutral venue, is the last clash of the year between
the trans-Tasman neighbors before end-of-year tours to Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
