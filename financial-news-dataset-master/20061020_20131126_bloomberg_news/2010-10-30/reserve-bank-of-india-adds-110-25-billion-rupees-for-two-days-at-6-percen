The Reserve Bank of India lent
110.25 billion rupees to banks for two days at 6 percent, taking
bonds as collateral at a securities repurchase auction, it said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The central bank is holding additional money-market
auctions today and Nov. 1 to help replenish cash in the banking
system after Coal India Ltd.’s 152 billion rupee initial share
sale, India’s biggest, drained funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
