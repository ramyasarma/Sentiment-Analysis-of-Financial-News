Poland’s Treasury Ministry today
called for bids for a majority percent stake in Grupa Lotos SA,
the country’s second-largest oil refiner, as the government
continues a $19 billion asset-sale plan.  The ministry wants potential buyers to place preliminary
bids by Feb. 4, it said in a announcement published in the
newspaper Rzeczpospolita. The government is seeking offers for
as much as its entire 53.2 percent stake, the announcement said.
The value of the state-owned stake is 2.09 billion zloty ($735
million) at yesterday’s closing price in Warsaw.  The Lotos sale, originally planned for this year and now
moved to 2011, is part of the government’s plan to raise 55
billion zloty from asset sales in the four years 2010-2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
