A New York judge ruled that Terra
Firma Capital Parters Ltd. founder Guy Hands will get no more
than $2 billion in damages, one-fourth of what he was seeking,
if he wins a case against  Citigroup Inc.  over the acquisition of
EMI Group Ltd., the Financial Times reported.  Hands says he wouldn’t have bid 265 pence a share for EMI
in May 2007 if he hadn’t received three phone calls from David
Wormsley, the head of Citigroup’s U.K. investment banking
operations at the time.  Judge Jed Rakoff, who had presided over the case for the
past two weeks, ruled out using a lost profit theory as a basis
for damage calculation, the newspaper reported. If a fair market
value theory proposed by Hands’ lawyer is accepted, Citigroup
may be exposed to a $2 billion damages claim, the newspaper
said.  Andrew Dowler, a London-based spokesman at Terra Firma,
declined to comment when contacted by phone.  Wormsley denies giving bid information to Hands and
Citigroup on Oct. 18 called Terra Firma’s allegations
“categorically untrue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
