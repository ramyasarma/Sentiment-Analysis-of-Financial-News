BHP Billiton Ltd. , the Australian
mining company making a hostile takeover bid for  Potash Corp.  of
Saskatchewan, has been looking at the target company since at
least 2006, the Globe and Mail reported, citing court documents.  Before he was chief executive officer of BHP,  Marius Kloppers  recommended internally that BHP could buy Potash Corp.
for $13 billion, the  newspaper  said.  Kloppers looked at the company again in 2008 after failing
in its takeover of  Rio Tinto Plc , the Globe reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
