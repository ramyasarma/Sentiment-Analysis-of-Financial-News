(Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest
steelmaker, may be delayed in receiving a license to mine iron
ore in the southern Indian state of Karnataka as local
authorities have yet to recommend its application to the federal
government, the Financial Express reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The mining application is related to ArcelorMittal’s
planned 300 billion rupee ($6.7 billion) steel project in
Karnataka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
