Real Madrid came from behind to beat
Hercules 3-1 and remain unbeaten in Spanish soccer’s Primera
Liga.  Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the final eight minutes
to give Real the win. David Trezeguet scored for Hercules in the
third minute and Angel di Maria tied the game early in the
second half.  Fabio Quagliarella and Alessandro Del Piero had the goals
as Juventus beat AC Milan 2-1. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored for
Milan, which would have moved atop the standings with a win.  Rangers were denied a 10th straight win to start the season

point of Rangers with a 3-0 win over St. Johnstone.  FC Twente beat PSV Eindhoven 1-0 to take the lead in the
Dutch Eredivise. Brest defeated St. Etienne to move atop
France’s Ligue 1 over Rennes and Marseille, whose game was
