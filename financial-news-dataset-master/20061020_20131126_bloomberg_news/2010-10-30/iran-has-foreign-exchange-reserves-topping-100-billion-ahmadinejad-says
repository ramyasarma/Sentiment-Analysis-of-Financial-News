Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said his country’s foreign exchange reserves exceed
$100 billion.  “They say that the foreign exchange reserves of the
country are estimated to be $100 billion, but it’s certainly
higher than this figure,” Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying
today in a report published on his  website .  Iran Central Bank Governor  Mahmoud Bahmani   said  last week
that the World Bank estimated Iran’s foreign holdings at $100
billion. Iranian officials usually don’t give a precise figure
for the country’s reserves.  Iran, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is under four rounds of United
Nations sanctions over its nuclear program.  Iran’s reserves have exceeded $100 billion,  Hossein Ghazavi , Iran’s central bank deputy chief, said in an interview
last year, also declining then to give a specific figure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
