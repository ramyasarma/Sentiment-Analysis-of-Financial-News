Ford Motor Co.  plans to implement a
wage increase for its 26,000 German workers earlier than
anticipated,  Automobilwoche  reported, citing one of the
carmaker’s managers.  The company’s German chief,  Bernhard Mattes,  agreed to
raise pay by 1.7 percent from February 2011, ahead of a
scheduled increase of 2.7 percent in April, the magazine
reported.  Robert Bosch GmbH and Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit advanced
wage increases last week and Daimler AG and Porsche SE are
preparing to lift salaries as well, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
