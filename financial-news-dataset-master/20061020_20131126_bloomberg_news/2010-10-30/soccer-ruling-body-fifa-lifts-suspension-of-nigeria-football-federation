Soccer’s ruling body lifted a ban on
Nigeria after court actions against members of the country’s
federation were stopped.  FIFA suspended the Nigerian federation on Oct. 4, though it
provisionally lifted it four days later. It was fully lifted
yesterday after  FIFA  received “confirmation that the court
actions against elected member of the NFF had ceased and that
they could now work without hindrance,” the governing body said
in a statement.  FIFA imposed the suspension for governmental interference,
which included the court actions. The ban was suspended
provisionally to allow Nigeria to play an African Cup of Nations
qualifying match in Guinea, which it lost 1-0.  Nigeria’s national team is ranked 34th in the world by
FIFA. It finished bottom of its group at this year’s World Cup
in South Africa with one point from three games.  Nigeria’s government reacted to the World Cup performance
by banning the team from international competition for two
years. It then lifted the ban under pressure from FIFA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
