U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  will sign a formal defence
treaty in London next week, the Financial Times reported, citing
government officials it didn’t identify.  The treaty is expected to co-ordinate deployments of the
countries’ aircraft carriers and ground troops. It will also
ensure that the new drive for military cooperation between the
two countries cannot be reversed by their successors, the
 newspaper  reported.  Britain and France together represent 45 percent of
Europe’s military budget, 55 percent of its operational forces
and 70 percent of its military research and technology, the FT
reported, citing a French official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
