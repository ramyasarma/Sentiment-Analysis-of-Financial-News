Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is
set to sign a new five-year, 20 million-pound ($32 million)
contract that will triple his current salary, the Daily Mirror
said.  Wilshere, 18, will raise his salary to more than 50,000
pounds per week from his current 15,000 pounds-a-week wage, the
Mirror said.  Clubs are restricted from long-term contracts until a
player turns 18, so Arsenal is determined to get the new deal
completed, the Mirror said. Wilshere made his debut with the
England national team against Hungary in August.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
