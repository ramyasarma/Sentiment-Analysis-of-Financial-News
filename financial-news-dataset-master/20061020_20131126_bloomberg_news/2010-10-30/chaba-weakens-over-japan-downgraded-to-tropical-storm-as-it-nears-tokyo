Tropical Storm Chaba weakened as it
headed toward islands south of Tokyo, lashing the Japanese
capital with rain and winds that forced events including horse
racing to be canceled.  Chaba, downgraded from typhoon strength, was about 440
kilometers (275 miles) southwest of Tokyo as of 10:40 a.m. local
time, the Japan Meteorological Agency said on its website. The
storm was moving northeast at 35 kilometers per hour with
sustained winds of 102 kilometers, the agency said, and will
make its closest approach to Tokyo tonight, passing 200
kilometers southeast off the Boso Peninsula.  Public broadcaster NHK reported cancelations of 30 domestic
flights between Tokyo and the Izu islands. The Japan Racing
Association postponed races in Tokyo until Nov. 1 because of the
storm, according to a statement on its  website .  Chaba dumped as much as 50 millimeters (2 inches) of rain
per hour as it passed the southern prefecture of Okinawa and
Amami Island, where three people died in storms that triggered
flooding and landslides last week.  Seven people suffered minor injuries in Okinawa, national
broadcaster NHK Television reported yesterday. On Amami, 260
people took refuge in temporary shelters, the Yomiuri newspaper
reported, citing local officials.  Chaba, the 16th tropical storm of the season, is the name
of a tropical flower in Thailand, according to the Hong Kong
Observatory, which lists names assigned to storms in the
northwest Pacific.  To contact the reporter on the story:
