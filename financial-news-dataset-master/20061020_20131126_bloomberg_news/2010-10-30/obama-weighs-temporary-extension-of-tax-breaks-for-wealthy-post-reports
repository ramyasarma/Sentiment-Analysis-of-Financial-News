The  Obama  administration is
considering a plan that would preserve tax breaks for both the
wealthy and the middle class as it faces likely Democratic
losses in the Nov. 2 midterm elections, the Washington Post
reported.  Administration officials are discussing “decoupling” the
Bush-era tax cuts to allow permanent extension for families
making less than $250,000 a year and temporary extension of cuts
for those making more, the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with talks at the White House and among senior
congressional Democrats. The Republicans would then be under
pressure to defend extending the cuts for the wealthy as they
expired in a year or two.  Debate over the tax cuts will resume when lawmakers return
to Washington in mid-November after elections. Forecast gains
for Republicans in the House and Senate would further erode
Democratic support for halting the Bush-era taxes on the wealthy
while continuing the extensions for the middle class, the
newspaper said.  President Barack Obama and most Democrats say they want tax
cuts extended for middle-income earners and to end for the
wealthiest Americans. Republicans want tax cuts extended for
everyone, arguing that an increase makes little sense as the
economy recovers from the worst recession since the 1930s.  To contact the reporters on this story:
