Volkswagen AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Winterkorn  sees a 30 percent risk that its merger
with Porsche SE won’t happen as agreed because of tax issues and
damage claims against the carmakers,  Automobilwoche  reported.  The merger would have to be renegotiated if the current
agreement isn’t implemented by the end of next year, Winterkorn
was quoted as saying in an interview. If the deal fails, VW
would take over Porsche’s operating business by 2014 at the
latest, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
