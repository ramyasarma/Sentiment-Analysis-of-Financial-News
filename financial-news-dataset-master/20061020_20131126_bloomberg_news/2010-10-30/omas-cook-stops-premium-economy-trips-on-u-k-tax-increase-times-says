Thomas Cook Group Plc, Europe’s
second-biggest tour operator, said it will stop offering premium
economy seats on outbound British flights from May to lure
passengers put off by higher taxes, the London-based Times said.  The tax has more than doubled for trips from the U.K. to
Asia and Australia and doesn’t differentiate between first-class
and premium economy passengers, the Times reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer  Manny Fontenla-Novoa . That has prompted the
airline to give the premium seats to regular economy passengers
instead, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
