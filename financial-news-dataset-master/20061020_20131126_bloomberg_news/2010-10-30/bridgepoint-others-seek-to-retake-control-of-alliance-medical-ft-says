Bridgepoint Capital Ltd., a U.K.
buyout firm, is in talks to retake control of medical-imaging
company Alliance Medical Ltd. which is seeking funds to repay
debt, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Three groups this week offered to invest between 75 million
pounds ($120 million) and 100 million pounds in return for
control of Alliance Medical, the newspaper reported. The other
two were U.K. InHealth Group and Hungary-based health-care
company  Euromedic International NV.  Bridgepoint sold the company
to Dubai International Capital LLC in 2007 for 600 million
pounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
