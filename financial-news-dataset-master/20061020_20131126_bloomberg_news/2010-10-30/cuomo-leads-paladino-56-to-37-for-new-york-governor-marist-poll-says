New York  Democrat  Andrew Cuomo  held
a 19 percentage-point lead over Republican  Carl Paladino  among
likely voters with less than a week remaining in the race for
governor, a Marist College poll reported today.  Cuomo, 52, the state attorney general and son of former
Governor  Mario Cuomo , received support from 56 percent of likely
voters, the poll said. Paladino, 64, a Buffalo-based real-estate
developer running with Tea Party support, was backed by 37
percent. An  Oct. 22 Marist poll  showed Cuomo with a 23
percentage-point lead, 60 percent to 37 percent.  Women supported Cuomo over Paladino, 64 percent to 29
percent. Among men, Cuomo led 47 percent to 45 percent. More
than three out of four voters, 78 percent, said the state is
headed in the wrong direction, the poll reported.  “With this level of dissatisfaction there was an
opportunity for Republicans that they have failed to take
advantage of as we approach Election Day,” said  Lee Miringoff ,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, New York.  The Oct. 26-28 telephone survey of 805 New York state
voters had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, and five
points among 415 who described themselves as likely voters,
Miringoff said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
