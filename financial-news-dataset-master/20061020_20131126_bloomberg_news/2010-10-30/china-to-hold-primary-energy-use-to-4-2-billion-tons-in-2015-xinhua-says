China’s primary energy consumption
in 2015 will be between 4 billion metric tons and 4.2 billion
metric tons of standard coal, Xinhua News Agency said, citing
Jiang Bing, the director of the development and planning
department of the National Energy Administration.  Primary energy consumption was 3.07 billion tons in 2009,
30 percent more than in 2005, and without controls may rise to 7
billion tons in 2030, Jiang said, as cited by Xinhua. Per-capita
consumption is now 2.5 tons, he said.  Consumption needs to be kept below 4.2 billion tons in the
2011-2015 five-year plan for the country to meet its targets of
drawing 15 percent of energy needs from non-fossil fuels, and
cutting emissions by unit of GDP by 40 percent to 45 percent,
Xinhua reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
