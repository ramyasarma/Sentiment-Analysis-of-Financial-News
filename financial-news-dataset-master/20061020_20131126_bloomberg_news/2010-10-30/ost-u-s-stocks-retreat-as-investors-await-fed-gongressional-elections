Most  U.S. stocks  fell this week and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index completed its second straight
monthly gain as investors awaited congressional elections and
the Federal Reserve’s plans for economic stimulus.  3M Co. dropped 6.9 percent, the most in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, after the maker of Scotch tape and
electronic signs cut its 2010 profit forecast. Measures of
industrial companies and utilities in the S&P 500 lost at least
0.6 percent, the most among 10 groups. Microsoft Corp. advanced
5.1 percent after the software maker beat earnings projections,
joining 75 percent of S&P 500 companies that have done so.  Among S&P 500 companies, 256 declined and 244 advanced this
week. The  index  gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,183.26. The
 Dow  slid 14.07 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,118.49.  “Most investors were focused on what’s going to happen
next week and, as a result, the markets have kind of treaded
water,” said  David Joy , chief market strategist at Columbia
Management in Boston, which oversees $347 billion. “That has
dominated investors.”  The S&P 500 rose 3.4 percent in October after surging 7.5
percent last month, the best September since 1939. Fed policy
makers meet Nov. 2-3 to consider steps to boost an economy
growing too slowly to reduce unemployment near a 26-year high.
The central bank has asked bond dealers and investors for
projections of central bank asset purchases over the next six
months as it seeks to gauge the possible impact of new efforts
to spur growth.  Online Bets  Chances  that Republicans will win control of the U.S. House
on Nov. 2 rose to a record 93.9 percent yesterday, according to
bets placed on Intrade, a Dublin-based online prediction market.
Democrats  retaining  leadership of the Senate was about 55
percent likely, Intrade data show.  “If Republicans were to capture the Senate as well, that
would come as a positive surprise to the market,” Joy said.  U.S. companies are poised to report the fourth straight
quarterly earnings increase. More than 70 percent of S&P 500
companies have topped the average profit estimate for six
straight quarters, the longest streak in Bloomberg data going
back to 1993.  3M fell 6.9 percent to $84.22. The company cut its 2010
profit forecast because of acquisitions announced during the
quarter and said pension expenses will be higher next year.  The total pension deficit at S&P 500 companies including 3M
is a record $380 billion,  David Bianco , head of U.S. equity
strategy at Bank of America Corp., wrote in a report sent to
clients yesterday.  Corporate Purchases  Microsoft gained 5.1 percent to $26.67. The world’s largest
software maker reported a 51 percent gain in first-quarter
profit, topping analysts’ predictions, as corporate customers
stepped up purchases of computers and programs that run on them.  Merck & Co. slid 2.1 percent to $36.31. The second-largest
U.S. drugmaker set aside $950 million to resolve a criminal
probe into the Vioxx painkiller it withdrew six years ago,
raising potential legal costs to $7.7 billion. The legal reserve
contributed to a 90 percent decline in third-quarter income to
$342 million.  Chevron Corp. fell 2.3 percent to $82.60. The second-
biggest U.S. energy company posted an unexpected drop in net
income, bucking the trend of bigger profits among the largest
oil companies, after costs from exploration failures erased
gains from higher crude prices and record production.  Rebranding  American Express Co. rose 6.2 percent to $41.46. The
biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by purchases hired former
executives of Sprint Nextel Corp. to bolster its online and
mobile unit and is rebranding Revolution Money, an Internet-
based payments network.  Monster Worldwide Inc. surged 28 percent, the most in a
week since October 2008, to $18.06 for the biggest gain in the
S&P 500. The world’s largest online-recruiting company reported
third-quarter results that beat analysts’ estimates and boosting
a forecast.  Eastman Kodak Co. jumped 20 percent to $4.70. The camera
maker said it will report up to $7.7 billion in sales this year,
compared with the average analyst estimate of $7.26 billion.  Coach Inc. climbed 12 percent to $50. The largest U.S.
maker of luxury leather handbags reported a 34 percent increase
in first-quarter profit after luring more shoppers to its
stores.  The U.S. economy expanded at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter and inflation cooled, underscoring the views of
Federal Reserve policy makers who say more stimulus will be
needed to spur growth. The report, which matched the median
economist estimate, was released yesterday by the Commerce
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
