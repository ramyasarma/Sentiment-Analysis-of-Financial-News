             Shares of  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Germany 's
largest steelmaker, climbed, as the country's DAX Index rose 1.5
percent. The company denied an Interfax report that it's
interested in buying U.S. Steel Corp. or Russia's OAO Severstal.  
 ThyssenKrupp spokesman Klaus Pepperhoff today denied the
company is in talks with either company. U.S. Steel would be the
more likely target, Interfax said late on June 8, citing a banker
it didn't identify.  
 Shares of ThyssenKrupp, based in Dusseldorf, Germany, gained
97 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 43.49 euros today. The stock has
advanced 22 percent so far this year.  
 ``From an industrial perspective, taking over U.S. Steel
could make sense,'' said Nils Lesser, an analyst at Merck Finck &
Co. in Munich who has a ``buy'' rating on ThyssenKrupp shares.
``Such a deal remains pure speculation at the moment, however.''  
 U.S. Steel, which has a market value of about $14.8 billion,
would give ThyssenKrupp access to mills in  North America  and
Europe and iron-ore mines in  Minnesota . U.S. Steel spokesman John Armstrong said on June 8 that ``we don't comment on rumors.''  
 Severstal Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Mordashov  said he
isn't in talks to sell Russia's biggest steelmaker to
ThyssenKrupp. No negotiations have been held with the German
steel group, Mordashov told reporters in St. Petersburg June 9.  
 ``Mergers and acquisitions is still an important aspect for
the sector and should be very supportive of valuations,'' Credit
Suisse analysts including Michael Shillaker wrote today in a note
to investors. It's ``unlikely'' that ThyssenKrupp will acquire
U.S. Steel, the analysts said.
