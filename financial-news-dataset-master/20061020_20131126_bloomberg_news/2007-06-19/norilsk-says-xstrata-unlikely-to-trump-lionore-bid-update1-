             OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) , the world's
biggest producer of nickel and palladium, said competitor  Xstrata
Plc (XTA)  is ``unlikely'' to trump its C$6.8 billion bid ($6.4 billion)
for Canada's LionOre Mining International Ltd.  
 Norilsk, based in Moscow, expects to get the final antitrust
approval from South Africa by June 28 and to complete the
transaction then, Chief Executive Officer Denis Morozov said
today in an interview in Moscow. The Russian mining company is
willing to extend the offer if necessary, he said.  
 ``Technically, Xstrata can come back, but it's very
unlikely,'' Morozov said. Norilsk wouldn't consider sharing
control of LionOre with Xstrata and would like to purchase all
stock in the Toronto-based company, he said.  
 The addition of LionOre will give Norilsk access to mines in
 Australia , South Africa and Botswana. For Xstrata the acquisition
would mean breaking into the world's top three nickel producers.  
 The two-month contest for LionOre may still be extended
should a third player enter the bidding or Xstrata collect at
least 50.01 percent of the tendered shares. Xstrata, based in
Zug, Switzerland, extended its offer of C$25 per share, versus
Norilsk's C$27.50, to June 28.  
 ``Extending our offer allows us to keep a seat at the
table,'' Xstrata spokesman Ian Hamilton said June 15 in an e-
mail.
