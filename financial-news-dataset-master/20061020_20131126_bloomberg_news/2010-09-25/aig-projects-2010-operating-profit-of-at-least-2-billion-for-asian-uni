American International Group Inc. 
said the Asian unit it’s going to list in Hong Kong will
probably boost pretax operating profit to at least $2 billion
for the fiscal year ending Nov. 30.  AIG is planning an initial public offering after a $35.5
billion agreement to sell AIA Group Ltd. to Prudential Plc
collapsed in May. Hong Kong-based AIA had $1.84 billion pretax
operating profit in 2009, Prudential said in a March filing.  “These kind of numbers make sense given the company has a
longer record operating in Asia than companies like the
Prudential and has a large market share,”  Kenny Tang , executive
director at Redford Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong, said
today. “The company is targeting China and the Asia market and
I think the response to a share sale here would be good.”  The American insurer is selling non-U.S. life insurance
businesses after a $182.3 billion U.S. bailout in September 2008.
AIG disclosed the profit forecast yesterday after providing it
to certain analysts.  “We believe that, in the absence of unforeseen
circumstances, and, on the bases and assumptions set forth below,
our consolidated operating profit for the fiscal year ending 30
November 2010 is unlikely to be less than $2 billion,” the
company said in a document released yesterday.  Premium Income  AIG also said AIA’s annualized new premiums gained 5
percent to $1.39 billion in the nine months ended Aug. 31, and
total weighted premium income rose 11 percent to $9.33 billion
in the same period.  AIA received preliminary approval for an IPO from the Hong
Kong exchange, paving the way for it to begin gauging investor
demand for shares in the company, two people with knowledge of
the matter said on Sept. 22. AIG may sell more than half its
stake in the offering, one of the people said.  On Aug. 6, AIG said second-quarter operating profit climbed
17 percent, fueled by U.S. life insurance results. Net adjusted
income of $1.34 billion, or $1.99 a share, increased from $1.14
billion, or $1.71, a year earlier. That was double the average
estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  told employees in
a memo that day that the company has begun talking to regulators
about “the process and terms of a complete government exit.”  AIG rose $1.40  to $36.47 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading on Sept. 24. The stock is up 22 percent year
to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
