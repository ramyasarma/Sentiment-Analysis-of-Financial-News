Unilever  is researching the Stone
Age diet with a view to new products, The Times in London
reported.  “We’re going to be doing interesting, cutting-edge science
but it has a hard business nose too,” Mark Berry, the Unilever
scientist leading the project told the Times. “We’re optimistic
and confidently predict that there will be a new range of food
and drink off the back of this but it is too early to say what
that will look like.”  Unilever has gathered academics, scientists, archaeologists
and geneticists to work beside its research and development
unit, the paper reported. They will try to piece together the
pre-historic diet and ascertain if it had nutritional benefits
or ingredients no longer in use, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
