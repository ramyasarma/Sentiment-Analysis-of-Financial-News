U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark
indexes to a fourth straight weekly gain, as signs of improving
demand for capital goods, technology products and consumer items
tempered concern the economic rebound is slowing.  Apple Inc. surged to a  record  as an analyst boosted sales
estimates for the iPad tablet computer, while Google Inc.
climbed to an almost five-month high. Nike Inc. surged to the
highest price since its initial public offering in 1980 after
earnings topped estimates on growing demand in North America and
China. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  erased three days of
losses yesterday as capital-goods orders exceeded forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 2.1 percent this week to 1,148.67 to cap
its longest weekly rally since April. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 252.41 points, or 2.4 percent, to 10,860.26. The
Russell 2000 Index of small companies increased 3 percent. All
three ended the week at their highest levels since mid-May.  “There’s a lot of momentum behind digital media,” said
 Michael Shinnick , a South Bend, Indiana-based money manager at
Wasatch Advisors Inc., which oversees $7.5 billion. “In the
past we had excessive consumption in housing and autos. Those
sectors continue to be weak, and the American consumer continues
to reset their spending priorities. That doesn’t mean they don’t
have the wherewithal to spend in other categories.”  The S&P 500 is up 9.5 percent in September, historically
the  worst month  for stocks. The main benchmark for American
equities has fallen 0.7 percent on average in September since
1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. It hasn’t gained
more than 8.3 percent in September since 1939. The index is up 3
percent in 2010 after recouping about two-thirds of its decline
from a 19-month high in April.  Stocks Rally  Stocks rallied yesterday after a government report showed
orders for durable goods excluding transportation equipment rose
in August at twice the pace forecast by economists. Next week
brings September gauges of consumer confidence and business
activity.  Apple jumped 6.2 percent to $292.32, capping a week where
it overtook PetroChina Co. to become the world’s second-biggest
company by market value. With its stock valued at $267 billion,
Apple trails only the $314.4 billion Exxon Mobil Corp.  Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in Minneapolis, said
Sept. 23 that Apple will sell 21 million iPads next year, an
increase from his earlier estimate of 14.5 million.  Apple , which has been expanding distribution channels,
selling more internationally and increasing sales to businesses
could reach $390 a share, Munster said. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg on average predict a share price of $342.81 in the
next 12 months.  Tech Boom  Google gained 7.6 percent to $527.29 for its best weekly
gain since February 2009. Technology companies in the S&P 500
increased 2.8 percent as a group, the second-biggest advance
among 10 industries after consumer-discretionary companies. An
18 percent drop by Adobe Systems Inc., which made a sales
forecast on Sept. 21 that trailed analyst estimates, limited the
advance.  Nvidia Corp. surged 16 percent to $12.26 for the  biggest
advance  in the S&P 500. The second-largest maker of graphics
chips led gains in semiconductor companies after Oracle Corp.’s
chief executive officer said it plans to make acquisitions in
the industry.  Amazon.com Inc., the largest Internet retailer, and Nike
Inc., the world’s largest maker of athletic shoes, rose to
records, helping lead companies that depend on discretionary
spending by consumers to the  biggest advance  in the S&P 500.  Amazon jumped 8.4 percent to $160.73. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised its 2011 profit forecast and predicted the shares will
reach $198. Digital sales of media products will benefit
Amazon’s  margin , analysts led by Imran Khan said in a report.  Nike, Banks  Nike added 3 percent to a $79.57. Per-share profit
excluding some items beat the  average analyst estimate  for a
17th straight quarter, as orders in North America and China
surged.  Banking shares declined as earnings estimates were lowered
by Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG.  Banking companies 
fell 0.7 percent as a group, one of only two industries to
decline among 24 groups in the S&P 500. Real-estate companies
slipped 0.2 percent.  Bank of America and Deutsche Bank lowered third-quarter
earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., citing weak trading revenue. Bank of America also cut its
estimates for Citigroup Inc.  Morgan Stanley  fell 5 percent to
$25.15, Goldman Sachs slipped 2.5 percent to $147.28 and
Citigroup lost 1.2 percent to $3.90.  CarMax Inc.  soared 16 percent to $27.35 for the second-
biggest advance in the S&P 500. The largest used-car dealer in
the U.S. reported second-quarter per-share earnings of 48 cents,
topping the average analyst estimate of 40 cents.  ‘Muddling Along’  “We’re in a situation where the global economy is muddling
along,” said Ron Holt, Chief Executive Officer of Hansberger
Global Investors Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which manages
$8 billion. “When you get companies that can demonstrate they
can grow in this kind of environment, investors will flock to
those companies.”  Gold futures climbed to a record, surpassing $1,300 an
ounce, the U.S. dollar weakened and two-year Treasury yields
touched a record low after the Federal Reserve signaled it will
keep U.S. interest rates near zero and take additional measures
to boost economic growth if necessary. The measures may include
additional purchases of U.S. government securities to lower
long-term interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
