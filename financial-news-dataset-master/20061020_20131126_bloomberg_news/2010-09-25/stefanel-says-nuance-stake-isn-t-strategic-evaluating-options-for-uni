Stefanel SpA  said its 50 percent
stake in airport retailer Nuance Group AG isn’t “strategic”
and the clothing company is evaluating options, including the
partial or total sale of its investment.  Stefanel isn’t in talks with investment banks to list the
shares of Nuance Group, the Ponte di Piave, Italy-based company
said in a statement late yesterday. Italy’s stock market
regulator asked Stefanel to issue the statement following
Italian press reports that it was considering an initial public
offering of Nuance shares.  Stefanel  shares rose 15 percent in Milan yesterday to 67.9
euro cents, giving the company a market value of 65.7 million
euros ($88.5 million.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
