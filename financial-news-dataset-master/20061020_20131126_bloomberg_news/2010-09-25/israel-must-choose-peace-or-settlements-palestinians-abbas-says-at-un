Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas said “Israel must choose between peace and the
continuation of settlements.”  “Our demands for the cessation of settlement activities,
the lifting of the siege and an end to all other illegal Israeli
policies and practices do not constitute pre-conditions that are
alien to the peace process,” Abbas told the United Nations
General Assembly today. “Israel’s implementation of these
obligations and commitments will lead to the creation of the
necessary environment for the success of the negotiations and
will give credibility to the pledge to implement the final
agreement reached.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
