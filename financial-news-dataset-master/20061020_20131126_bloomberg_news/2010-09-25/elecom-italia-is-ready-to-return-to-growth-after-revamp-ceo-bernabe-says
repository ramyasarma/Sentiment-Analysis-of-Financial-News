Telecom Italia SpA  Chief Executive
Officer  Franco Bernabe  said Italy’s largest telephone company is
ready to return to growth after the company’s “repositioning.”  Bernabe spoke at a presentation in Riva del Garda, Italy
today that was broadcast on the  Internet .  Telecom Italia’s mobile phone services are “by far” the
most competitive on the market, while some consumers considered
them too expensive previously, he said.  Telefonica SA,  Spain’s largest telephone company, has been
of “great support” through its investment in Telecom Italia,
Bernabe said. Telefonica is an investor in Telecom Italia’s
biggest shareholder,  Telco SpA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
