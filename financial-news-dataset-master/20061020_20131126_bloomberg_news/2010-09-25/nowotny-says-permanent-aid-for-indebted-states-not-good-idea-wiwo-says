European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Ewald Nowotny  said “it’s not a good idea” to
create a permanent European Union safety net to assist debt-
stricken member countries, WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing an
interview.  An extension of the current three-year solution could be
discussed if countries proceed successfully with their reforms,
Nowotny said, adding that he sees no immediate need to do so.  Current EU deficit criteria are also too narrow, Nowotny
said.  “We need a broad assessment which also takes account of
the real economy, the economic structure of countries and the
sustainability of development,” WirtschaftsWoche quoted him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
