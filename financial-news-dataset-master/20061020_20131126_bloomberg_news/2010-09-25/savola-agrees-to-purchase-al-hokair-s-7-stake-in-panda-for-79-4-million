Savola Azizia United Co. , a Saudi
food producer, agreed to buy  Al-Hokair Group ’s 7 percent stake
in Azizia Panda United Co. in a stock transaction valued at
297.6 million riyals ($79.4 million).  Savola Azizia plans to issue 8.7 million shares to pay for
the holding, the company said in a  statement  on the Saudi bourse
today. The amount represents 1.6 percent of Savola Azizia’s
capital and is based on its share price at 34.2 riyals,
according to the statement.  Jeddah-based Savola Azizia, which has 113 outlets in Saudi
Arabia, is expanding its businesses to meet rising demand from a
growing population in the Arab world’s biggest economy. In
August, the company agreed to buy  Al-Muhaidib Holding ’s 18.6
percent stake in Azizia Panda and a 10 percent stake in Savola
Foods Co., in return for raising Al-Muhaidib’s stake in Savola
Azizia to 15 percent.  After completion of the transaction announced today, Savola
Azizia will own Azizia Panda in its entirety.  The latest acquisitions represent a “strategy aimed at
further focusing on the retail sector,” Savola Azizia Managing
Director Abdul-Raouf Mana’a said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
