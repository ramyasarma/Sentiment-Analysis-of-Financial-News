Fernando Alonso won the pole
position for the Singapore Grand Prix, where the top five
drivers in the standings will start at the front of the field.  Alonso will start ahead of Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel,
with McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton third fastest in qualifying. The
Spaniard will have the advantage during the evening race through
the streets of Singapore.  “We know how important it is to be on pole in a street
circuit but we know anything can happen: safety cars, the start,
the rain, many factors,” Alonso told the British Broadcasting
Corporation. “We need to control all of them.”  Alonso is third in the standings this season with 166
points, with Hamilton on 182. The leader Mark Webber of Red
Bull, has 187 points, and will start fifth in the race.
Hamilton’s teammate, Jenson Button, who is a point behind
Alonso, will start in fourth place in the race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
