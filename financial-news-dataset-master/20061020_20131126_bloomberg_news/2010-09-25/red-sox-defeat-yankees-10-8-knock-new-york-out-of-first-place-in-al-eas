Jed Lowrie  and  Bill Hall  hit three-
run home runs to give the Boston Red Sox a 10-8 win against the
New York Yankees, who fell out of first place in the American
League East division.  The Tampa Bay Rays (92-61), who defeated visiting the
Seattle Mariners 5-3, moved a half-game ahead of the Yankees
(92-62). The Rays have nine games left, while the Yankees have
eight -- including five more against the Red Sox.  The Yankees trailed 10-1 in the sixth inning before
rallying to within two runs as  Alex Rodriguez  and  Mark Teixeira 
each hit a pair of homers in the game last night in New York.  The two home runs gave Rodriguez 610 in his career, moving
him past Sammy Sosa into sixth place in Major League Baseball
history.  The Philadelphia Phillies increased their lead in the
National League East to seven games over the Atlanta Braves. The
Phillies defeated the visiting New York Mets 3-2 for their 11th
straight win, while Atlanta lost 8-3 at Washington.  The San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres both won,
leaving the Giants with a half-game lead over the Padres atop
the National League West. The Padres are a half-game ahead of
Atlanta for the NL wild card.  Tim Lincecum  and  Brian Wilson , who recorded his 45th save,
combined on a two-hitter as the Giants won 2-1 in Colorado.
 Miguel Tejada  drove in three runs in the Padres’ 4-3 home win
against Cincinnati.  To contact the reporter on this story:
