China’s housing ministry and
banking regulator are jointly probing the way commercial lenders
implement second-home policy curbs in major cities, the China
Business Journal reported, citing an unidentified official
at the housing ministry.  The investigation, which was started in the middle of this
month, will report its results after the Oct. 1-7 holidays for
policy makers to decide if policy changes are needed, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
