Treasuries rose, pushing the yield
on the 10-year note down the most in six weeks, as the Federal
Reserve signaled its willingness to ease monetary policy further
to boost the economy and return inflation to its target.  The two-year note yield touched a  record low  this week on
speculation the central bank will increase purchases of U.S.
debt to keep interest rates low. The Treasury announced that it
will auction $100 billion in 2-, 5- and 7-year notes next week,
compared with $102 billion in August.  “This week has been all about the Fed, which has lowered
the bar for additional quantitative easing and is considering
it, putting inflation squarely in the crosshairs and giving a
boost to Treasuries,”  William O’Donnell , U.S. government bond
strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 2.61 percent, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625 percent security
maturing in August 2020 increased 1 1/8, or $11.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 1/8.  The government reduced two- and five-year note offerings
next week compared with the August sale by $1 billion to $36
billion and $35 billion, respectively, while keeping the
offering of seven-year securities at $29 billion.  The drop in the 10-year  yield  was the biggest since the
five days ended Aug. 13, when it slid 15 basis points. The two-
year note yield decreased 2 basis points to 0.44 percent after
touching the record low of 0.41 percent on Sept. 22.  ‘Bull Trend’  “There is an underlying bid in the market as the bull
trend in Treasuries remains intact,” said  Martin Mitchell , head
government bond trader in Baltimore at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., a
brokerage firm. “The Fed has tipped their hand that they are
likely to initiate a larger-scale asset-purchase program in the
future. If the Fed becomes a larger buyer, the Treasury market
can only go higher.”  The Fed said in its statement on Sept. 21 that it’s
prepared “to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to
levels consistent with its mandate.”  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17.  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the maturity known as the
break-even  rate , was 1.84 percentage points, compared with the
five-year average of 2.11 percentage points.  Economic growth slowed to a 1.6 percent annual pace in the
second quarter, from 3.7 percent from January through March, the
Commerce Department said Aug. 27. The unemployment rate
increased to 9.6 percent from 9.5 percent, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 3.  The central bank retained its stance from its Aug. 10
meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at about
$2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the financial
system. The  Fed  bought $3.89 billion of Treasuries yesterday
maturing from September 2014 to August 2016, increasing the
amount it has bought since Aug. 17 to $34.062 billion.  The Fed completed a program of quantitative easing in
March, purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed
securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. The central
bank was the biggest buyer of Treasuries when it bought $300
billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  Citigroup’s View  Another round of asset purchases by the central bank may
exceed the amount it bought in 2009, according to Citigroup
Inc., a primary dealer.  “Should quantitative easing become necessary, we expect
that the sizing will be approximately $100 billion per month in
U.S. Treasuries only, with an initial window of two to three
quarters,”  Brett Rose , a strategist at Citigroup in New York,
wrote in an e-mailed report this week.  Yields on five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
turned negative after the Fed said inflation is running below
levels that reflect a healthy economy.  As yields on conventional shorter maturities have plunged,
investors have been willing to buy TIPS with negative yields
betting that return from the inflation adjustment will exceed
the interest the fixed-rate notes pay. TIPS pay interest on a
principal amount that rises with consumer prices.  The five-year inflation-protected note yield dropped 16
basis points to negative 0.029 percent. The price of the 0.5
percent security maturing in April 2015 gained 23/32, or $7.19
per $1,000 face amount, to 102 13/32.  The TIPS yield last turned negative on Aug. 6, four days
before the central bank said it would keep its bond holdings
level by resuming the purchase of U.S. debt.  Yields on TIPS maturing in July 2012 have been negative
since July 20 as yields on conventional two-year Treasuries
dropped to record lows well below the annual rate of inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
