Collingwood and St. Kilda tied
68-68 in the first drawn Australian Football League grand final
since 1977.  The Melbourne rivals will return for a replay next week
after St. Kilda’s Lenny Hayes tied the game with a minute and a
half remaining, leaving the scores at 10.8 (68) to 9.14 (68) in
front of a crowd of 100,016 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  Collingwood, seeking its 15th premiership and first since
1990, also played in the last drawn grand final 33 years ago,
losing the replay to North Melbourne. The only other drawn grand
final was in 1948.  “Everyone’s got to get up again,” Collingwood coach Mick
Malthouse said in a televised interview with the Seven Network.
“This is a great test of mental toughness and stamina.”  St. Kilda, which beat Collingwood by one point in 1966 for
its only premiership win, recovered a 24-point halftime deficit
to avoid a second straight grand final loss following last
year’s 12-point defeat to Geelong.  “It’s a pretty unique experience,” Saints coach Ross Lyon
told the Seven Network. “Every ounce of our being now goes into
next week. We’ll let it rip again.”  Hayes was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for the best player
of the grand final after finishing with a game-high 32
possessions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
