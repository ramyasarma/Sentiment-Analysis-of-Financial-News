Palermo’s airport will stay closed
until at least tomorrow after a Wind Jet SpA aircraft landed off
a runway, the Associated Press said, citing Loredana Rosati, a
spokeswoman for Italy’s civil aviation authority.  Passengers on the flight from Rome were evacuated using
emergency chutes following the Airbus 300’s landing late
yesterday, the news agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
