Nobel laureate  Robert Merton  and
Columbia University professor  Jeffrey Sachs  will advise Chile’s
government on meeting the country’s economic development goals,
Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said today.  The economists, who also include Harvard University
professor  Edward Glaeser  and Boston University professor
 Laurence Kotlikoff , are scheduled to meet with Larrain and
President  Sebastian Pinera  today and tomorrow and will be
invited back on an annual basis, the minister told reporters at
the presidential palace in Santiago.  Pinera, who started his four-year term in March, has
promised to eradicate extreme poverty during his administration
and position the economy to increase average income per capita
to as much as $22,000 from the existing $14,000 by 2020. Chile’s
goals can be reached as the economy withstood the 2008 financial
crisis and the February earthquake, said Merton, winner of the
1997 Nobel Prize in economics.  “It’s a challenge, it truly is, but it can be
achievable,” Merton told reporters at the palace. Merton said
the government may consider using resources to protect the
economy against future “shocks to the system, whether they be
in the commodities areas or things outside the control of the
government.”  Chile’s economy may expand by as much as 5.5 percent this
year, the most in five years, the central bank said in its
latest monetary policy report. Chile’s government, which next
week plans to publish its 2011 budget proposal, wants public
spending to grow at a slower pace than the economy, Larrain said
today.  The government may increase spending by about 5 percent
next year, Santiago-based newspaper  El Mercurio  reported today
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
