Regulators shut lenders in Florida
and Washington amid losses on real-estate loans, pushing the
number of  U.S. bank failures  to 127 for the year.  Haven Trust Bank Florida of Ponte Vedra Beach and
Arlington, Washington-based North County Bank were closed,
according to statements on the  website  of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which was named receiver. The failures cost the
agency’s deposit-insurance fund $104.7 million.  “Deposits will continue to be insured by the FDIC, so
there is no need for customers to change their banking
relationship in order to retain their deposit insurance
coverage,” the FDIC said.  Banks are failing at a faster pace than last year, which
saw the most failures since 1992, as real estate values remain
depressed and economic recovery stays sluggish. Regulators
closed 140 banks last year. The FDIC’s list of “problem” banks
climbed to 829 lenders with $403 billion in assets at the end of
the second quarter, a 7 percent increase from the 775 on the
list in the first quarter, the FDIC said last month.  Coupeville, Washington-based Whidbey Island Bank paid a 2
percent premium to acquire $276.1 million in deposits and four
branches from North County, the FDIC said.  First Southern Bank of Boca Raton, Florida, took over Haven
Trust’s two branches and shared losses on $127.3 million in
assets with the FDIC, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
