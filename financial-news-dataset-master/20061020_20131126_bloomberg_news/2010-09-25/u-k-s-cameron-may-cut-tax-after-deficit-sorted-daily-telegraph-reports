U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said he will be able to cut taxes once the country’s record
budget deficit is “sorted,” the Daily Telegraph reported,
citing an interview.  The government wants to “give something back” to the
British taxpayer once the economy is stronger and the recovery
will bring a time when the population can “share in the
growth,” the Conservative party leader was quoted as saying.  The opposition Labour Party will announce its new leader
today with polls suggesting am increase in support as government
spending cuts bite. A survey on Sept. 21 by YouGov Plc put
Cameron’s Conservatives, in coalition with the smaller Liberal
Democrats, neck and neck with Labour at 39 percent.  David Miliband  or his brother Ed, both former Cabinet
ministers, will win the contest to succeed  Gordon Brown , polls
and bookmakers indicate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
