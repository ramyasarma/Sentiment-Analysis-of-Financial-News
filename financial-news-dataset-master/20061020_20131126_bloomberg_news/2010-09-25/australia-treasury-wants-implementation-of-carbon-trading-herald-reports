Australia’s Treasury has advised
the government to implement a carbon-trading program as soon as
possible, the Sydney Morning Herald reported today, citing
documents obtained under the freedom of information act. “The
sooner an emissions trading scheme can be implemented the
better,” the Treasury said in documents prepared for the
incoming administration.   The ruling Labor Party shelved carbon trading during the
previous legislative period, and Prime Minister Julia Gillard
during this year’s election campaign promised a citizens’
assembly to build public support before deciding whether to
proceed with such a plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
