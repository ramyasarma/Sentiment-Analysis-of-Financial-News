             Fox Business Network, scheduled to
begin broadcasting next month, named five Fox News Channel
reporters as anchors of the new financial channel.  
 They include David Asman, Cheryl Casone, Rebecca Gomez,
Dagen McDowell and Stuart Varney, Fox, a division of  News Corp. (NWSA) ,
said today in a statement.  
 Fox Business Network plans to begin broadcasting on Oct.
15. New York-based News Corp. has agreements with cable
companies that guarantee the channel will be available in 30
million homes. The channel will compete with  General Electric
Co. (GE) 's CNBC and Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.  
 Asman hosts ``Forbes on Fox.'' Casone, Gomez and McDowell
are business correspondents for Fox News. Varney has been with
Fox News' business team since 2004, recently as a contributor
and substitute host for ``Your World with Neil Cavuto.''  
 They will retain their roles at that channel, Fox said.  
 News Corp. Class A  shares  fell 5 cents to $21 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have declined
2.2 percent this year.
