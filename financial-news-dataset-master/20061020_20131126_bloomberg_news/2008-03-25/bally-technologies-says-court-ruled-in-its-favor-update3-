             Bally Technologies Inc. (BYI) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of slot machines, said a U.S. court
ruled in its favor, rejecting patent-violation claims by
International Game Technology and Shuffle Master Inc.  
 The ruling by the U.S. District Court of Nevada found
Bally's MP21 table-game system didn't infringe on one patent and
deemed a second patent invalid, Bally said today in a statement.
The court's ruling dismisses  IGT (IGT)  and Shuffle Master's case and
leaves in place two counterclaims by Bally.  
 Bally and IGT, the world's largest slot machine maker, are
in litigation over three additional patent-infringement issues
related to the way their games pay out bonuses and on other
technology. Two of the cases are scheduled to go to trial in
November and December.  
 Bally, based in  Las Vegas , rose $1.24, or 3.4 percent, to
$37.93 at 4:05 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have  fallen  24 percent this year.
