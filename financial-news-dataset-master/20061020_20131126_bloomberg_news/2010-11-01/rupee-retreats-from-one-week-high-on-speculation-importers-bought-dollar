India’s rupee retreated from a one-
week high on speculation importers took the opportunity to buy
dollars at a more favorable exchange rate.  The rupee rose earlier as investors predict the central
bank will raise interest rates for a sixth time this year at a
meeting tomorrow, boosting the allure of the nation’s higher-
yielding assets. Investors based abroad pumped $24.6 billion
into Indian stocks this year and bought a record $9.1 billion of
bonds.  “The current level of the rupee seems extremely attractive
for importers,” said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a Mumbai-based foreign-
exchange trader at Development Credit Bank.  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 44.48 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, compared with 44.4325 at the end of
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
rose 0.3 percent to 44.31, the strongest level since Oct. 25.
The currency has declined 1 percent since touching a two-year
high of 43.96 on Oct. 15.  The Reserve Bank of India will increase the  repurchase rate 
to 6.25 percent from 6 percent tomorrow, according to 15 of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Offshore forwards indicated the rupee will trade at 45.01
against the dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 45.12 on Oct. 29. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
