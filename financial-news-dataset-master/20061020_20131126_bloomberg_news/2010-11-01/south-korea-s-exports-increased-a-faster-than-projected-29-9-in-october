South Korea’s exports grew faster
than projected, weathering a surge in the won as the nation’s
carmakers and chip manufacturers benefited from rival Japan’s
struggle to restrain a bigger jump in the yen.  Exports  increased 29.9 percent in October from a year
earlier, after gaining a revised 16.5 percent in September, the
Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in Gwacheon today. That
compared with the median estimate for a 16.2 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News  survey  of seven economists.  Imports  climbed 22.4
percent, leaving a trade surplus of $6.9 billion.  Exports have fueled South Korea’s growth this year, and the
ministry today predicted the 2010 trade surplus may reach a
record. While the recovery has helped to stoke price pressures,
the Bank of Korea left borrowing costs unchanged in October for
the third straight month at it assesses the strength of the
global economy.  “Exports are very strong and rose to a new record last
month, adding to evidence the economy remains steady,” said Lee
Sang Jae, an economist at Hyundai Securities Co. in Seoul.  The won has risen 5.8 percent in the past three months
against the dollar, while export rival Japan’s yen has surged
7.1 percent.  Competitive Edge  That has given an edge to companies such as Suwon-based
Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s biggest maker of semiconductors,
flat screens and mobile phones. Still, Samsung last week
forecast weaker fourth-quarter earnings because of falling
prices and the strengthening currency.  The won rose 0.7 percent to 1,117.06 as of 10:43 a.m. in
Seoul. The benchmark Kospi stock index advanced 0.8 percent to
1,898.53.  Export growth cooled to an 11-month low in September as
some of the nation’s factories shut down for a holiday season.
Overseas shipments are equivalent to about half of South Korea’s
economy.  Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 4.5 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, down from 7.2 percent in the
previous three-month period. The Bank of Korea has increased the
benchmark rate once in 2010, by 0.25 percentage point from a
record-low 2 percent in July.  Exports increased to $44.1 billion in October, a monthly
record, from a revised $39.5 billion in September, today’s
report showed.  Record Surplus  The trade surplus is expected to rise to a record level in
2010, surpassing last year’s $40.4 billion, the economy ministry
said in a statement today. For the first 10 months, the nation’s
trade surplus was $36 billion, the ministry said.  Shipments to the Middle East rose 86.1 percent in the first
20 days of October from a year earlier, the ministry said today.
Shipments to China, the biggest buyer of South Korean goods,
gained 33.8 percent and shipments to the U.S. advanced 71
percent. Exports to Japan rose 44.3 percent.  Shipments of semiconductors climbed 33.1 percent last
month and display-panel sales increased 8.8 percent, the
ministry said. Exports of ships rose 22.6 percent, while those
of cars gained 32.8 percent. Exports of car parts increased 50.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
