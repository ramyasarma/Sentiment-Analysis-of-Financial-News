China Construction Bank Corp. , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, said it received
regulatory approval for a rights offer that will raise 61.7
billion yuan ($9.2 billion).  The company plans to issue 630 million A shares at 3.77
yuan each and 15.73 billion H shares at the same price, CCB said
statements to Shanghai’s stock exchange. Investors will be
entitled to 0.7 share for each 10 shares held.  Macau October Revenue  Las Vegas Sands Corp. ,  Wynn Resorts Ltd.  and  Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd.  shares rose in New York trading after Macau
casino revenue soared 50 percent to a record in October, boosted
by China’s Golden Week holiday.  Total gambling  revenue  for  SJM Holdings Ltd. ,  Sands China
Ltd.  and the four other casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony increased to 18.9 billion patacas ($2.4
billion) last month from 12.6 billion patacas a year earlier,
Macau’s  Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  said.  Germany G-20 Yuan  Germany supports urging China to let the yuan appreciate
gradually, the German government said in a position paper for
next week’s meeting of Group of 20 leaders.  Participants are likely to discuss “politically directed
exchange rates,” including the Chinese currency, at the Nov.
11-12 summit in Seoul, South Korea, according to the document
shown to reporters. China should let the yuan appreciate “in
stages,” the paper said.  Rare Earth Supply  The U.S. Defense Department is short-sighted in its
assessment that China’s monopoly on rare-earth materials, which
are used in military hardware, poses no threat to national
security, said U.S. Representative  Mike Coffman .  The Pentagon’s report, on which some members of Congress
have been briefed prior to its release, notes that rising prices
and supply uncertainties are spurring private investment in new
mining operations outside of China that will help meet American
military needs, a person familiar with the findings said.
Military use accounts for less than 5 percent of U.S. rare-earth
consumption, according to the report.  “I strongly disagree” with the report’s conclusions, said
Coffman, a Colorado Republican who received a briefing on the
Pentagon’s yearlong study. “It’s a very myopic view and it’s
certainly not looking at the economic security of the country,”
he said in a phone interview. “It’s only looking at the
Department of Defense.”  China Cap-Trade  China is showing interest in starting cap-and-trade
programs for greenhouse gases amid a “very uncertain” outlook
for a national carbon market in the U.S., according to the chief
of the  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.   “Tremendous discussion and movement towards more carbon
trading is coming out of China,”  Jeff Sprecher , chief executive
officer of the Atlanta-based company, said on a conference call.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks rose, recovering from a late-day tumble, as

semiconductor sales rose in September. Baker Hughes Inc. rallied
4.4 percent after the oilfield-services company beat earnings
