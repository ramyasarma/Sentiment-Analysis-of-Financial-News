China’s Xinxiang Kuroda Mingliang
Leather Co. will open a $67 million leather factory in Ethiopia
on Nov. 24, adding to the billions of dollars already invested
in the East African country by China.  Xinxiang financed 55 percent of the project, with the
remainder coming from the China-Africa Development Fund, the
Chinese embassy in Ethiopia said in an e-mailed statement today.  Chinese investments in resource-poor Ethiopia demonstrate
that it is interested in more than extracting raw materials from
Africa, Chinese Ambassador Gu Xiaojie said in an interview on
Oct. 28. China’s ZTE Corp. lent $1.5 billion in 2008 for
Ethiopian Telecommunication Corp. to upgrade its infrastructure,
while other companies have helped build hydroelectric plants,
the ring-road around Addis Ababa and the part-completed African
Union Conference Center.  “Ethiopia is the best example to refute some of the
criticism of China being in Africa only for resources,” Gu
said. “It has got nothing, but we are coming to their needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
