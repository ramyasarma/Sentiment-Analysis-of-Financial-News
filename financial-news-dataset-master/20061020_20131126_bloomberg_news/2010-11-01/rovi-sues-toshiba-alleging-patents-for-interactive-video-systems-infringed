Rovi Corp. , a provider of parental
controls and other interactive video systems, accused Japan’s
 Toshiba Corp.  of misusing technology covered by three U.S.
patents and seeks a court order to stop the infringement.  Rovi, based in Santa Clara, California, was formed in 2008
when Macrovision Corp. acquired  Gemstar-TV Guide International
Inc. , according to an Oct. 29 lawsuit filed in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The company “invests significant resources in the
development of interactive program guide, parental controls and
related technologies,” and deserves damages, Rovi said in the
complaint.  The complaint targets Tokyo-based Toshiba’s TV and digital-
video recorders. Rovi contends Toshiba is aware that the
products infringe patents awarded since 2000.  Toshiba officials didn’t immediately return phone and e-
mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Rovi Corp. v. Toshiba Corp., U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 6,020,929; 6,305,016 and
6,701,523.  To contact the reporter on this story:
