Pangaea Partners Ltd., a U.S.
investment banking group that specializes in emerging markets,
said it sold its stake in Zambian stockbroker Pangaea
Renaissance Securities Ltd. for an undisclosed sum.  “This sale to a major international investment bank is a
vindication of my personal belief in Zambia’s potential,” Eric
Postel, the founder of Madison, Wisconsin-based  Pangaea , said in
a statement received today, without saying who bought the stake.  Pangaea is a founding member of the southern African
nation’s  stock exchange , which is based in the capital, Lusaka
and started trading in 1994. It created Pangaea Securities
Zambia one year later.  In 1998, the Zambian company merged with EMI Securities to
increase its size in the southern African country. Renaissance
Capital purchased a 49 percent stake in Pangaea/EMI Securities
in April 2008. Two months later Pangaea was one of the managers
of the $200 million initial public offering of  Celtel Zambia
Plc , that country’s largest mobile-phone service company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
