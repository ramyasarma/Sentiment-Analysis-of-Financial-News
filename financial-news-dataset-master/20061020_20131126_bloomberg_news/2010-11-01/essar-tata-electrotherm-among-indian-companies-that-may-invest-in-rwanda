At least 20 Indian companies,
including Essar Group and Tata Group, may invest hundreds of
millions of dollars in Rwanda, said Clare Akamanzi, chief
operations officer of the Rwanda Development Board.  “Sectors of focus are information technology, mining,
agro-processing, education, pharmaceuticals and energy,”
Akamanzi told reporters in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, today. “We
cannot say how much in terms of investments or give a time frame
now, but project proposals we discussed are in the hundreds of
million dollars.”  Other companies that committed to investing in the East
African country, following a trip to four Indian cities by the
board, include Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  Electrotherm India
Ltd.  and Universal Empire Group, according to a statement from
the board. There are 29 Indian investment projects totaling $55
million in Rwanda, according to the board, which said it expects
to register foreign investment projects valued at $550 million
in 2010 from $541 million last year.  Essar Group may invest in Rwanda’s geothermal industry,
while Tata expressed interest in the transportation and
information technology sectors, according to the board. The two
Mumbai-based companies will begin feasibility studies before the
end of this year, it said. New Delhi-based Universal Empire has
handed the Rwanda Development Board a $250 million proposal to
establish an education facility, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
