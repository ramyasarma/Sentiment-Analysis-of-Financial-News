Gold may gain in New York as a
weakening dollar boosts demand for precious metals as an
alternative investment. Silver jumped to a 30-year high of more
than $25 an ounce and palladium reached a nine-year high.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell to a one-week low on speculation the
Federal Reserve will this week announce further measures to keep
borrowing costs low to spur growth. Gold futures, which usually
move inversely to the greenback, reached a record $1,388.10 an
ounce on Oct. 14.  “The theme of background dollar weakness has continued,”
said  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.
“We expect dip-buying to continue with reaction to the Fed
policy meeting Wednesday potentially triggering a fresh influx
of demand to precious metals as investors focus on wealth
protection.”  Gold futures for December delivery added $2.90, or 0.2
percent, to $1,360.50 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.1 percent
higher at $1,360.45. Spot prices reached an all-time high
$1,387.35 on Oct. 14.  Bullion rose to $1,361.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,346.75 at the afternoon fixing on Oct. 29.  Precious metals have gained this year as central banks
maintained low interest rates and governments spent trillions of
dollars to spur growth. Silver has advanced 48 percent in 2010
and palladium has surged 60 percent, both beating gold’s 24
percent rise. Precious metals have outperformed global equities,
Treasuries and most industrial metals, boosting investment in
exchange-traded products backed by the metals.  Asset Purchases  The Fed will meet on Nov. 2-3 and policy makers are
expected to announce another round of government bond purchases,
a policy known as quantitative easing, after they bought $1.7
trillion in debt from December 2008 to March. Concern about
possible further monetary easing in the U.S. has supported
prices.  Estimates of the size of the Fed’s next round of asset
purchases range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at
both firms agree the Fed may start with a $500 billion plan.  “While the decision on further monetary easing has the
potential to disappoint given the strong market performance over
the past several weeks, we think the longer-term threat of
uncertainty and inflation could limit” declines for metals,
analysts led by  Hussein Allidina  at Morgan Stanley wrote in a
report today.  ETP Holdings Retreat  China should buy gold and oil overseas with foreign-
exchange reserves to avoid losses from a weakening dollar, Shao
Fenggao, an official at China Construction Bank Corp., wrote in
a commentary published in the China Business News today. Iran
has changed some 15 percent of its foreign-exchange reserves
into gold and won’t need to import the metal for the next 10
years, news agency Mehr reported Oct. 30, citing Central Bank
Governor  Mahmoud Bahmani .  Gold assets in  ETPs  dropped 1.96 metric tons to 2,087.5
tons on Oct. 29, an 11th consecutive decline, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a
record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14. Silver assets dropped 74.84
tons to 14,186.28 tons on Oct. 29, data from four providers
show.  Silver for December delivery in New York gained as much as
2 percent to $25.055 an ounce, the highest price since March
1980, and was last up 1.7 percent at $24.97. The metal reached
an all-time high of $50.35 in New York in 1980, a year after the
Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  An ounce of gold bought as little as 54.3652 ounces of
silver in London today, the smallest amount since August 2008,
before the collapse of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
triggered the worst recession since World War II.  Palladium for December delivery rose 1.5 percent to $654.55
an ounce after earlier climbing to $657.30, the highest price
since May 2001. Platinum for January delivery added 0.9 percent
to $1,723 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
