The planned merger of  Continental AG 
and Schaeffler Group may be delayed by several years or fail
altogether because of U.S. tax demands,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing unidentified people close to Schaeffler.  The U.S. wants to tax Georg Schaeffler, who lives in the
country and owns 80 percent of the namesake German manufacturer,
for $400 million generated through a reorganization of the
company, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people close to
the companies. Schaeffler Group has agreed to pay the resulting
levy, Handelsblatt said.  The car-component  makers  could face as much as $1.5 billion
in additional U.S. taxes for their merger, the German newspaper
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
People close to the companies disputed that and said any figure
has yet to be set, Handelsblatt reported.  Marcus Brans, a Schaeffler spokesman, wasn’t available for
comment when Bloomberg called the Herzogenaurach-based company
outside of normal working hours.  Hannes Boekhoff , a spokesman
for Hanover, Germany-based Continental, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
