Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
voter approval fell after a collision between the Coast Guard
and a Chinese trawler in disputed waters damaged relations
between the countries, according to a Sankei newspaper poll.  The approval rate for Kan’s Cabinet dropped to 36.4 percent
from 48.5 percent a month earlier, the Sankei said. The
telephone survey contacted 1,000 people on Oct. 30-31. A margin
of error wasn’t provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
