Blackpool beat nine-man West Bromwich
Albion 2-1 last night in a matchup of promoted teams in English
soccer’s Premier League.  Blackpool took the lead through Charlie Adam’s 12th-minute
penalty kick after Pablo Ibanez was red carded for a foul on DJ
Campbell. West Brom went down to nine men in the 29th minute
following Gonzalo Jara’s lunge on Luke Varney, who put Blackpool
2-0 up before Youssouf Mulumbu scored for West Brom.  Blackpool’s first home league win of the season lifted it
seven places to ninth through 10 games. With West Brom in sixth
and Newcastle seventh, it’s the first time all three promoted
clubs have been in the top half of the standings at this stage
of the season.  “We made hard work of it,” Adam told Sky Sports. “It was
actually harder against the nine men, they sit there with two
banks of four. You have to win games ugly and we’ve done that.”  Defending champion Chelsea tops the standings with 25
points, five ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United.  To contact the reporter on this story:
