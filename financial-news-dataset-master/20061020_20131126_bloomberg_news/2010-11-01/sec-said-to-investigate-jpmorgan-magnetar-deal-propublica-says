The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating a transaction between JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and the Magnetar Capital hedge fund, ProPublica reported,
citing people familiar with the investigation.  The agency is examining whether the hedge fund improperly
chose assets for a $1.1 billion deal backed by subprime
mortgages, ProPublica said. The deal, known as Squared, was
completed in May 2007 and was a collateralized debt
obligation comprised of pieces of other CDOs, ProPublica
reported.  JPMorgan earned $20 million creating the Squared
transaction, ProPublica said, citing an unidentified person
involved in the deal. The bank kept portions of Squared
on the lender's books and lost about $880 million on the
transaction, ProPublica said, without citing a source.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
