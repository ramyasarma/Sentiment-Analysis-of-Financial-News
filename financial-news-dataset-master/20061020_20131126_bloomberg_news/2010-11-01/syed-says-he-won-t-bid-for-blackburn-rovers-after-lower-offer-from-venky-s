Ahsan Ali Syed, who in August said he
would pay 60 million pounds ($96 million) for Blackburn Rovers,
won’t follow through after Venky’s (India) Ltd. agreed to buy
the English soccer team for 46 million pounds.  Syed, who founded Western Gulf Advisory AG, said he would
invest 300 million pounds in the club, including spending 100
million pounds on new players. Venky’s, an Indian operator of
poultry farms, said Oct. 26 that it would buy the 1995 Premier
League champions to harness a growing interest in soccer in its
home country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
