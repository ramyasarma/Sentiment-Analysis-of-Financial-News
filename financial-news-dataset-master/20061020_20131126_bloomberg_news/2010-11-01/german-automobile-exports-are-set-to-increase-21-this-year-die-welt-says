German auto exports may increase by
21 percent this year to 4.15 million units, driven by a rise in
demand in China and the U.S.,  Die Welt  reported, citing  Matthias Wissmann , head of the VDA industry group.  The group estimates that auto production in German
factories may increase 10 percent this year, to 5.45 million
units, the newspaper cited Wissmann as saying in a preview of an
interview to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
