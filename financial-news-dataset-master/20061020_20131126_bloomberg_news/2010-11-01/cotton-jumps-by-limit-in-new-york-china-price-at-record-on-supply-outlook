Cotton surged by the daily maximum to
trade near a record in New York on concern that global supplies
may be curbed by weather damage to crops in China and the U.S.
Futures jumped to an all-time high in China.  Cotton for December delivery advanced by the daily limit of
4 cents to $1.2926 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. and traded at
that level at 1:40 p.m. Tokyo time. The contract reached $1.305
on Oct. 26, the highest level since the fiber started trading
140 years ago.  “Adverse weather in China and the U.S. has spurred a
buying spree,”  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at Tokyo-based
commodity broker Central Shoji Co., said today. “Cotton is one
of the most-favored commodities among speculative funds.”  Cotton rose 23 percent in October, the biggest monthly gain
since June 2007. The price has jumped 71 percent this year as
global supplies trail demand, making it the best-performing
commodity on the  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index .  China’s harvest will drop to 6.4 million tons in the year
that began Aug. 1, 7.9 percent lower than a year earlier, said
Cotlook Ltd., a research firm based in Birkenhead, England. That
forecast was made before the China Meteorological Center said
Oct. 25 that a cold front moving across the nation might hamper
harvesting and reduce fiber quality.  Before the cold spell, China’s  output  was forecast to be
4.03 million tons lower than estimated consumption, according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Purchases by the world’s
most-populous nation could further drain global stockpiles
projected by the USDA to drop to a 14-year low in the coming
year.  Crops  in the U.S., the largest shipper, were damaged by a
hailstorm in Texas.  Cotton for May delivery on the Zhenzhou Commodity Exchange
jumped by the daily 5 percent limit to a record 28,585 yuan
($4,282) a ton before trading at 28,580 yuan at the 11:30 a.m.
local-time break.  To contact the reporter on this story:
