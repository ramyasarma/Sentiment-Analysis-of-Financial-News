France will be forced to increase
gasoil imports and boost refinery production after last month’s
workers’ strikes left the country with reduced fuel inventories,
Credit Agricole CIB said.  Inventories of gasoil, a category of fuel that includes
heating oil and diesel, fell below 53 million barrels at the end
of last month,  Christophe Barret , an oil analyst, wrote in an e-
mailed report today. That’s 8.6 million barrels below the five-
year average from 2003 to 2008.  Labor unrest across France last month forced ten refineries
to halt operations, leaving some service stations without fuel
and pushing up wholesale prices.  Total SA , Europe’s biggest
refiner, lost about 100 million euros ($139 million) because of
the strikes by refinery and port workers.  “French oil markets should return to normal by mid-2011,”
London-based Barret wrote in the report. “In the meantime
rebalancing should provide some support to gasoil and crude oil
markets.”  Stockpiles of gasoline will recover more quickly than
gasoil, with inventory levels to be “comfortable” by the end
of November. French gasoline exports will be 100,000 barrels a
day lower than usual this month and last, Barret wrote.  French refineries will process an average of 1.7 million
barrels of crude daily next year, 175,000 barrels a day more
than in 2010, according to the Credit Agricole estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
