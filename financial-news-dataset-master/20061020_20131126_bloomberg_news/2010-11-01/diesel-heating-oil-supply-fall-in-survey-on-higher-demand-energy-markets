U.S.  supplies  of diesel and heating
oil probably dropped to the lowest level since July as demand
climbed and exports to Europe likely rose because of a French
strike, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles of distillate fuels fell 1 million barrels, or
0.6 percent, in the seven days ended Oct. 29 from 168.4 million
a week earlier, according to the median of 17 analyst  estimates 
before an Energy Department report tomorrow. All of the
respondents forecast a drop. Labor unrest across France last
month forced 10 refineries to halt operations, boosting prices.  Diesel, used to fuel the heavy trucks that move almost all
consumer goods in the U.S., benefited from a third-quarter
increase in spending by individuals. Purchases gained 0.2
percent in September, the third consecutive increase, Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday. The U.S. economy expanded
at a 2 percent annual rate in the quarter, it said Oct. 29.  “Demand will probably stay strong,” said  Carl Larry ,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “You’re
seeing greater use of transportation fuel here, and an
increasing number of cargoes heading to France because of the
strike.”  Heating oil for December delivery rose 1.59 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.2936 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since Oct. 13.  Prices increased from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. distillate
stockpiles decreased 4.73 million barrels to 161.4 million last
week, the lowest level since the week ended July 9. December
heating oil rose 3.04 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.3081 a gallon
in electronic trading at 4:38 p.m.  Higher Demand  Distillate demand , as measured by the amount supplied to
wholesalers and distributors, climbed 2.8 percent to 4.06
million barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 22, the highest
level since May. Consumption has risen 9.7 percent since the
week ended Oct. 8, as the strike crimped French fuel production.  Total freight shipping volume in the U.S. increased 15
percent in October from a year earlier, to the highest level for
the month since 2007, according to a report yesterday by Cass
Information Systems Inc., a Bridgeton, Missouri-based trucker
payment-services company. The  Cass Freight Index  fell 5.2
percent last month from a 25-month high in September.  France will be forced to increase imports of gasoil, the
equivalent of heating oil in the U.S., and boost refinery output
after the strike reduced fuel supplies,  Christophe Barret , a
London-based oil analyst with Credit Agricole CIB, said in a
report yesterday.  Gasoil inventories in France fell below 53 million barrels
at the end of last month, 8.6 million barrels less than the
five-year average from 2003 to 2008, Barret said.  French Forecast  “French oil markets should return to normal by mid-2011,”
London-based Barret wrote in the report. “In the meantime
rebalancing should provide some support to gasoil and crude oil
markets.”  Diesel, which powers 77 percent of cars sold in France, is
the fuel with the tightest supply because of the refinery
shutdowns,  Alexandre de Benoist , head of the Independent Fuel
Importers Union, or UIP, said on Oct. 18.  U.S. homeowners who use heating oil will spend an average
$2,124 this winter, up 11 percent from $1,906 a year earlier,
according to the Energy Department’s monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook , released on Oct. 13. The cost per gallon will average
$3.06 this heating season, up 23 cents from the prior year.  Heating oil warms 7 percent of homes nationwide and 30
percent of households in the  Northeast . That region is
responsible for 80 percent of the nation’s residential heating-
oil consumption.  Distillate Stockpiles  Distillate fuel  inventories  in the week ended Aug. 20 were
the highest since 1983. They were 21 percent above the five-year
average in the week ended Oct. 22.  U.S. refineries operated  at 84 percent of capacity last
week, up 0.3 percentage point from the previous week and the
highest level in a month, according to the Bloomberg survey.
Companies idle units for maintenance in autumn, when gasoline
consumption declines and winter heating-oil demand has yet to
gain.  Crude-oil  inventories  rose 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4
percent, from 366.2 million a week earlier, the survey showed. A
gain of that size would leave stockpiles at the highest level
since May 2009. They were 13 percent above the five-year average
in the previous report.  Twelve analysts forecast an increase, four predicted a drop
and one said supplies were unchanged.  Refinery Operations  “Oil is likely to rise on the back of improvements in
imports,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based hedge fund focusing on energy. “The refinery
runs are neutral to bearish as well.”  Oil imports  jumped 10 percent in the week ended Oct. 22 to
9.46 million barrels a day, the most since the seven days ended
Aug. 27.  Oil for December delivery advanced 95 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $83.90 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest
level since May 3.  Prices climbed from the settlement after the API reported
stockpiles decreased 4.14 million barrels last week to 367.6
million. December oil rose $1.49, or 1.8 percent, to $84.44 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:39 p.m., the highest intraday
price since May 4.  Gasoline stockpiles  were unchanged from 214.9 million in
the prior week, the survey showed. Inventories were 7.4 percent
above the five-year average in the week ended Oct. 22. Eight of
the respondents projected an expansion, seven a decline and two
said there was no change.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
