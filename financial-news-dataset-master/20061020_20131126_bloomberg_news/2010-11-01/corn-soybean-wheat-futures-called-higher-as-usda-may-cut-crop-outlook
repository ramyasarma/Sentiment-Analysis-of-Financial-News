What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture will cut its estimate for this year’s
crop in its next forecast update on Nov. 9, said  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that U.S. production will be smaller than the
government said last month and as dry weather threatens
developing crops in South America, Schultz said. Soybean-meal
futures may open steady to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is expected to open up 0.25 cent to 0.4 cent a
pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as dry weather threatens plant development before
crops in the U.S. and Russia enter winter dormancy, Schultz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
