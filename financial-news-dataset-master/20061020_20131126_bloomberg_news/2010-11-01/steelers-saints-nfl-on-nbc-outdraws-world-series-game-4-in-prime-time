The New Orleans Saints’ 20-10 prime-
time National Football League win over the Pittsburgh Steelers
last night drew a larger television audience than Game 4 of
baseball’s World Series.  NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” was seen in 11.8 percent of
households in the top 56 U.S. TV markets, the  General Electric
Co . network said today in a statement, citing Nielsen Co. data.
That’s 13 percent more than the 10.4 rating  News Corp .’s Fox
drew with the San Francisco Giants’ 4-0 win over Texas Rangers.  The Giants’ win left them one victory away from claiming
their first Major League Baseball championship since 1954, when
they were based in New York. Each rating point equals 1 percent
of the 115.9 million U.S. TV households.  It’s the first time that “Sunday Night Football” went
head-to-head with the baseball championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
