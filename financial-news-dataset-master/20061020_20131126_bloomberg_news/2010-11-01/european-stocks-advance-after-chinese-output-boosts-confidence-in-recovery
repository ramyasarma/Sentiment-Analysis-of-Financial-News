European stocks rallied after Chinese
manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in six months,
bolstering confidence in the global economy. U.S. index futures
and Asian shares advanced.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.5 percent to 267.18 at
8:08 a.m. in London. The benchmark gauge advanced 2.4 percent
last month as investors speculated that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will unveil another round of bond purchases at this week’s
meeting, a tactic for boosting the economy known as quantitative
easing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
