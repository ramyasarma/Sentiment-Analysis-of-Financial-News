Richards Bay Coal Terminal , Africa’s
biggest export facility for the fuel, raised shipments to a
monthly record in October, enabling owners including Xstrata Plc
to take advantage of rising prices.  Outbound deliveries came to 7.38 million metric tons, the
terminal said in an e-mailed statement today. The previous
record, set in December 2005, was 7.24 million tons.  The terminal shipped 61.14 million tons of coal last year
and this year expanded its capacity by 26 percent to 91 million
tons. Owners of the property, located on South Africa’s
northeastern coast, also include BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, and Anglo American Plc.  Coal prices climbed 8 percent from a year earlier to $89.61
a ton in October, according to data on Bloomberg from
Petersfield, England-based researcher IHS McCloskey. That
followed a 42 percent increase in average prices in September,
when Richards Bay exports jumped 29 percent to 5.36 million
tons.  Higher shipments also cut the terminal’s coal stockpiles by
32 percent from a month earlier to 2.94 million tons as of the
end of October, according to figures published on its website
today. Richards Bay received 5.86 million tons of coal last
month, down 3.3 percent from September, the figures showed.  Total import and export tonnage of 13.38 million tons
handled in October exceeded December 2005’s 13.24 million tons,
the terminal said. It has exported 52.09 million tons of coal so
far this year.  South Africa mined about 250 million tons of coal in 2009,
or 4.1 percent of world output, making the country the seventh-
largest producer, according to an Oct. 1 report by UBS
Investment Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
