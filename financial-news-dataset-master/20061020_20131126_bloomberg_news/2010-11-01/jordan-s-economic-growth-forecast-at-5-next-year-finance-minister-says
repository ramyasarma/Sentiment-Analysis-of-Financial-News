Jordan’s economic growth will
accelerate to 5 percent in 2011 from a projected 4 percent this
year, Finance Minister  Mohammad Abu Hammour  said.  “This will be a result of measures the government has
taken like lowering of the income tax by between 15 and 50
percent on various industries and big infrastructure projects
like a railway project, and the current expansion of the
airport,” Abu Hammour said in a telephone interview from Amman
today. “The economy has also been on the rebound and exports in
the first 8 months grew 15 percent.”  Jordan’s economic growth accelerated to an annual 2.9
percent in the second quarter, led by the mining and transport
industries. The rate compares with 2 percent growth in the
previous quarter. Growth was 2.3 percent in 2009.  In a May interview Abu Hammour said the economy would grow
as much as 4 percent this year, while the  International Monetary
Fund  says it may grow by 3.4 percent in 2010 and 4.2 next year,
as regional growth accelerates. Jordan, one of the smallest
economies in the Middle East, imports more than 90 percent of
its oil and relies on foreign investment and grants to finance
deficits in the budget and the current account.  Foreign grants more than doubled in the first eight months
of the year to 249 million dinars ($352 million), compared with
103 million dinars in the same period of 2009.  Deficit Narrows  The kingdom’s budget deficit narrowed to 428 million
dinars in the first eight months of this year from 758 million
dinars in the same period in 2009 after the receipt of grants
and a reduction in government spending. The projected budget
deficit for this year after grants is 1 billion dinars or 6
percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 9 percent
last year.  The government plans to cut the fiscal deficit to 5 percent
next year and reduce operational expenses by 15 percent while
increasing capital expenditures by 16 percent, Abu Hammour said.  Jordan hired JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  HSBC Holdings Plc ,
Credit Suisse Group AG and Arab Bank Plc last month to manage
the sale of a $500 million Eurobond to help finance the nation’s
budget deficit.  The bond was rated today Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and BB by Standard & Poor’s in line with the country’s long-term
foreign-currency debt ratings.  Jordan’s foreign  debt  increased by 1.6 percent to 3.93
billion dinars in the first seven months of the year, the
Ministry of Finance said in a  report  last month. Domestic  debt 
increased 10.6 percent to 6.4 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
