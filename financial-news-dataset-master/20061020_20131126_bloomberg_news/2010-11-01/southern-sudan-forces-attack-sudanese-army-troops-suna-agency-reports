Armed forces from the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement, the party that governs the semi-autonomous
Southern Sudan region, attacked a Sudanese Army position on Oct.
30, the state-run SUNA news agency said.  Sudan army forces repelled the hour-long attack and pushed
the southern forces south of the border dividing the regions,
SUNA reported late yesterday, citing Al-Sawarmi Khaled, the
Sudanese army spokesman.  The attack took place in al-Zamaly area in the northern
Sudanese state of Sennar, on the border with Southern Sudan’s
Upper Nile state, the Khartoum-based news agency said, citing
Khaled.  Southern Sudan is scheduled to vote in January on secession
from Sudan. The referendum is a key component of the 2005 peace
agreement that ended two decades of civil war between the Muslim
north and the south, where Christianity and traditional beliefs
dominate. About 2 million people died in the conflict, and more
than 4 million were displaced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
