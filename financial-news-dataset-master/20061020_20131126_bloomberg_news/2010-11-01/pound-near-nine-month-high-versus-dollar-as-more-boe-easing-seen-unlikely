The pound approached the highest
level in nine months against the dollar on speculation the Bank
of England will refrain from joining the Federal Reserve in
renewed asset purchases this week.  The British currency was within a cent of the strongest in
almost a month versus the euro as data showed  manufacturing 
unexpectedly accelerated in October. Bank of England policy
makers meet this week to decide on interest rates and whether to
expand a 200-billion-pound ($321 billion) quantitative-easing
program. The pound had its biggest weekly gain in over a year
last week after data showed gross domestic product growth was
double analysts’ estimates.  “In the wake of the GDP report last week, people have had
a reassessment of the prospect for QE this week pushing up
sterling against the dollar and the euro,” said  Jeremy Stretch ,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at CIBC World Markets in
London. “That leaves the pound vulnerable to a surprise.”  The pound climbed 0.1 percent to $1.6048 at 4:01 p.m. in
London, approaching Oct. 15’s peak of $1.6107, which was the
highest since Jan. 29. Sterling was 0.5 percent stronger at
86.54 pence per euro and climbed 0.4 percent to 129.46 yen.  A gauge based on a survey of companies by Markit Economics
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply rose to
54.9 from 53.5 in September, according to an e-mailed statement
today in London. The median forecast of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a decline to 53. A measure above
50 indicates expansion.  Gilts Rise  A separate report showed U.K.  house prices  fell the most
since January 2009 last month, according to Hometrack Ltd. The
average cost of a home slipped 0.9 percent from the previous
month to 156,200 pounds, a fourth straight decline, the London-
based property researcher said. Demand from buyers fell 2
percent, while the number of homes for sale rose 1.9 percent.  U.K. government bonds advanced, with the yield of the 10-
year gilt dropping two basis points to 3.05 percent. The 4.75
percent security due March 2020 rose 0.14, or 1.4 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 113.705. Two-year yields rose three
basis points to 0.69 percent.  U.K. gilts lost investors 1.4 percent in October, paring
this year’s returns to 8.5 percent, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German government bonds lost 1.1 percent
last month, while U.S. Treasuries dropped 0.2 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
