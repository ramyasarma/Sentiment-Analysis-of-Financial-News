BASF SE  said it will revamp its
paper-chemical division to focus more on Asian markets, closing
some production lines in Germany and cutting 300 jobs.  Paper-dye production will be relocated to Ankleshwar,  India 
from Grenzach, Germany, BASF said in an e-mailed statement
today. The Grenzach site will be geared toward making
ingredients for cosmetics and the personal care industry.  “Currently, paper chemicals are a difficult business to be
in,” Fred Baumgartner, head of BASF’s paper chemicals division,
said in the statement. “Manufacturing is increasingly
concentrated in Asia’s emerging markets, which is where future
growth in the paper industry will originate.”  BASF is close to completing its 3.1 billion-euro ($4.2
billion) purchase of Cognis Holding GmbH, part of Chief
Executive Officer  Juergen Hambrecht ’s drive to diversify BASF
away from commoditized chemical markets. BASF said it would be
able to offer many employees in Grenzach jobs at other
facilities, and talks with  workers’  representatives have begun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
