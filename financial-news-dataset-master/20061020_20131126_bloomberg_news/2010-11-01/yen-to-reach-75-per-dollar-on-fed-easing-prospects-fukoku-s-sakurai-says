The yen may rise toward a postwar
record of 75 versus the dollar if the Federal Reserve goes ahead
with easing policies that will further debase the greenback,
according to  Fukoku Capital Management Inc.    The yen touched 80.22 against the dollar today, the highest
level since April 1995, when it set a postwar high of 79.75. The
Fed starts a two-day meeting tomorrow where it may announce
another round of asset purchases known as quantiative easing,
and the Bank of Japan meets Nov. 4-5.  “The yen may keep strengthening against the dollar as long
as the Fed carries out quantitative easing and there’s no sign
that it will stop,”  Yuuki Sakurai , who helps oversee the
equivalent of $8.7 billion as chief executive officer and
president at Fukoku Capital, said in an interview in Tokyo.  The U.S. will experience long-term economic stagnation
though it will likely avoid a double-dip recession, Sakurai
said. The yen will continue to strengthen as long as there’s
room left for U.S. easing, and signs of an exit from Fed
stimulus are unlikely to surface until the second half of next
year, he said.  Estimates for a new round of asset purchases by the Fed
range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global
Research to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The Bank of
Japan last week left unchanged its credit programs and benchmark
interest rate, while it moved up the dates of its next meeting
from Nov. 15-16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
