The  African Union Mission in Somalia 
said it will train an additional 800 policemen to provide
security in the capital, Mogadishu, as AU peacekeepers make
gains against militias seeking to topple the government.  “Amisom forces continue to take ground from armed
opposition groups in Mogadishu,” Wafula Wamunyinyi, deputy
special representative of the chairman of the AU Commission for
Somalia, told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital of
neighboring Kenya. “We intend to ensure that areas falling under
Amisom control will be under police, not soldiers, to ensure law
and order in Somalia.”  About 600 existing policemen and 80 police officers will
receive further training in South Africa and Rwanda “to have a
strong and capable police force conforming to international
standards,” Amisom police commissioner Benzu Hudson Siazyanana
told reporters in the city.  Somalia’s Western-backed government has been battling
insurgents, including the al-Shabaab militia that has pledged
loyalty to al-Qaeda, since 2007. Somalia hasn’t had a
functioning central administration since the ouster of former
dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  The training of the police force comes after Somalia’s
parliament yesterday approved the appointment of Mohammed
Abdullahi Mohammed as the country’s new prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
