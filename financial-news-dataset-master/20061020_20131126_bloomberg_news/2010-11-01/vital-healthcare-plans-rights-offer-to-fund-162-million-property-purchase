Vital Healthcare Property Trust , a
New Zealand-based owner of medical real estate, fell the most in
more than a decade in Wellington trading after it announced
a NZ$151 million ($116 million) share sale to partly fund the
acquisition of Australian properties.  Vital Healthcare agreed to buy 12 medical and hospital
properties from Essential Healthcare Trust for A$164.5 million
($163 million), it said in a statement today. The company plans
a one-for-one rights at NZ$1.05 a piece, a 22 percent discount
to yesterday’s closing price, it said. It will be the largest
fund raising on New Zealand’s stock exchange this year.  The deal will increase Vital Healthcare’s distributable
income, the average lease lengths of its properties and provide
more exposure to Australia’s health-care sector, the company
said. The properties include surgical and psychiatric hospitals
in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.  “This transaction aligns with our long-term strategy,
enhances portfolio metrics and is forecast to improve unit
holder returns,”  Bill Thurston , chairman of Vital Healthcare
Management Ltd, the trust’s manager, said in the statement.  Vital Healthcare shares fell 10 cents, or 7.5 percent, to
NZ$1.24 at the 5 p.m. market close in Wellington, their biggest
decline since May 16, 2000. Earlier the stock dropped as much as
8.2 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
