“The relative importance of housing
to the consumer has been highly exaggerated,” according to
 Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  Levkovich drew the conclusion by tracking the equity in
single-family homes and other owner-occupied real estate as a
percentage of U.S. household net worth, using data compiled by
the Federal Reserve.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, home equity accounted
for 16.2 percent of net worth at the end of the second quarter,
the Fed’s data showed. The first quarter’s figure, 15.4 percent,
was the lowest in more than half a century.  Housing no longer has the effect on  consumer confidence 
that it did when home prices were surging in the past decade,
Levkovich wrote in an Oct. 29 report that included a similar
chart. Equity in owner-occupied real estate peaked in the fourth
quarter of 2005 at 25.5 percent of net worth.  “While the housing market’s ascent initially drove
feelings of wealth during the mid-2000s, that relationship
basically has broken down,” he wrote. “ Employment trends  and
 stock-market wealth  seems to have much more impact.”  Higher share prices may make consumers feel good enough to
spend more during this year’s holiday shopping season, Levkovich
wrote. Through October, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced
6.1 percent for the year.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
