The trial of three U.S. citizens
accused of spying in Iran will be delayed, according to the
Iranian judiciary.  The proceedings were originally scheduled to begin Nov. 6.
They will be postponed because one of the three, Sarah Shourd,
wasn’t summoned to appear, according to the state-run  Islamic
Republic News Agency , citing Prosecutor-General  Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei , who didn’t give a new trial date. She will now be
told to appear for trial with her companions, Shane Bauer and
Josh Fattal, the judiciary said.  Shourd was released on $500,000 bail Sept. 14 and has
returned to the U.S. Bauer and Fattal remain in custody. The
three were arrested in July 2009 for illegally crossing into
Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. The U.S. government has said they
mistakenly wandered across the border during a hiking trip.  In a statement, the families of Bauer and Fattal said they
“continue to pray that Iran will release them on humanitarian
grounds. Shane and Josh, like Sarah, have done nothing wrong,
yet today marks the start of their 16th month in detention and
we urge Iran to show them the same compassion.”  Shourd is from California, while Bauer is a Minnesota
native and Fattal is from Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
