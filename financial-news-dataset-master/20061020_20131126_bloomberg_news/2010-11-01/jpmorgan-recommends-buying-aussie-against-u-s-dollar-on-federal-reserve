Investors should buy the Australian
dollar against its U.S. counterpart on expectation that the
Federal Reserve will step up Treasury purchases after its Nov.
2-3 meeting, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “We expect the dollar’s decline to resume should the Fed
remove uncertainty and deliver a $500 billion slug of asset
purchases next week,”  Paul Meggyesi , a managing director of
currency strategy at JPMorgan wrote in a research report dated
Oct. 29 and sent to journalists today. “The domestic case for
further tightening in Australia is largely unanswerable.”  Investors should buy the so-called Aussie at 97.77 U.S.
cents and abandon the trade if it weakens to 95.1 cents,
Meggyesi said. No estimate of the Aussie’s future value against
the dollar was given.  JPMorgan also recommended buying the euro, the Swedish
krona and the Korean won against the dollar.  The Australian dollar was 0.5 percent stronger at 98.81
U.S. cents as of 12:18 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
