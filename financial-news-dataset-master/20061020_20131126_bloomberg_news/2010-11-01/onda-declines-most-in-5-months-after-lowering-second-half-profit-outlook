Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, fell the most in almost five months in Tokyo
trading after the company lowered its second-half earnings
outlook.  Honda dropped as much as 4.4 percent, the most since June
7, to 2,807 yen and traded at 2,812 yen as of 10:16 a.m. in
Tokyo. It was the second-largest decline among companies in the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average , which fell 0.1 percent.  The automaker expects to earn 92 billion yen ($1.1 billion)
in net income in the six months ending March 31, compared with
an earlier forecast for 105 billion yen in profit, according to
a Bloomberg calculation based on the company’s first-half
earnings statement on Oct. 29.  Honda revised its outlook as the yen trades near a 15-year
high against the dollar, reducing the value of overseas
earnings. The Tokyo-based maker of Accord sedans also lowered
its full-year global vehicle sales forecast to 3.615 million
units from an earlier estimate of 3.64 million, citing weaker
demand in North America and Europe.  Sales in North America aren’t recovering as much as Honda
earlier expected, Executive Vice President  Koichi Kondo  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
