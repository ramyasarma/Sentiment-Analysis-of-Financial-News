Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s state-
owned rail, ports and pipeline operator, said acting Chief
Executive Officer  Chris Wells  will resign by March 31.  Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba, who was sworn in
today after a Cabinet reshuffle, will be tasked with continuing
the search for a replacement for Wells, who took on the job in
March 2009, after serving as the group’s chief financial officer
for four years. No reason was given for Wells’s departure.  “The publication of the pleasing half-year results a few
days ago bears testimony to his clear direction and focus on
improving operational performance,” according to an e-mailed
statement today from Johannesburg-based Transnet.  Transnet last week reported that first-half profit rose 35
percent after improved productivity permitted it to transport
record volumes of coal and iron ore.  Transnet spokesman Mboniso Sigonyela declined to comment
further when contacted on his mobile phone by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
