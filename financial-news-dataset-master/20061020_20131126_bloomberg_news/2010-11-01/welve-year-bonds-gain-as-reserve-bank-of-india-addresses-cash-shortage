India’s 12-year  bonds  gained for a
fourth day after the central bank introduced measures to ease a
cash crunch in the banking system.  The yield on most-traded debt due 2022 fell to the lowest
level since Oct. 14 after the Reserve Bank of India yesterday
said it will hold additional money-market auctions this week to
lend money to banks that face fund shortages. The monetary
authority also allowed lenders to temporarily lower holdings of
debt below regulatory requirements to raise cash.  “Bond-market sentiment has improved following the RBI’s
measures to support liquidity,” said  Sanjay Arya , a Mumbai-
based treasurer at state-run Bank of Maharashtra. “There’s some
talk in the market that the RBI may be less aggressive with
monetary policy measures as the cash situation remains tight.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due May 2022 declined
two basis points to 8.07 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price
increased 0.17, or 17 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.47.  The rate at which Indian banks lend  overnight  to each other
touched a two-year high of 12.25 percent on Oct. 29 after state-
owned Coal India Ltd. raised 152 billion rupees ($3.4 billion)
in the nation’s biggest initial share sale.  The central bank may raise interest rates for a sixth time
this year tomorrow to curb inflation, boosting the repurchase
rate to 6.25 percent from 6 percent, according to 15 of 23
economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Six of the eight
predicting no increase expect higher borrowing costs by year-end.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
climbed for the first time in three days. The rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, rose three basis points
to 6.73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
