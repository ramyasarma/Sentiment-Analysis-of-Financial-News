Cameroon’s farm-gate arabica coffee
price increased 0.5 percent in the week through Oct. 31, an
official from the North West Cooperative Association said.  The average price of washed and dried arabica, known as
parchment, rose to 1,010 CFA francs ($2.15) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) from 1,005 francs a week earlier, Waindim Timothy,
administration and personnel manager of the cooperative, said in
an e-mailed report today from Bamenda, 400 kilometers (250
miles) northwest of the capital, Yaounde.  The average arabica export price dropped by 3.2 percent to
1,979 francs a kilogram compared with a week earlier, according
to Bloomberg calculations from the Cocoa and Coffee Board
Statistics. Average robusta coffee export prices rose 4.8
percent to 812 francs during the week, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
