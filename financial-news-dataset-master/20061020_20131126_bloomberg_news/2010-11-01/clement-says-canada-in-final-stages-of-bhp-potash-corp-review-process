Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement said today the government is in the “final stages” of
its deliberations on whether to allow BHP Billiton Ltd.’s
hostile purchase of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Clement declined
to be specific on the timing of his ruling, saying the
government must make a decision as soon as possible. Clement
faces a Nov. 3 deadline to issue a decision on the proposed bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
