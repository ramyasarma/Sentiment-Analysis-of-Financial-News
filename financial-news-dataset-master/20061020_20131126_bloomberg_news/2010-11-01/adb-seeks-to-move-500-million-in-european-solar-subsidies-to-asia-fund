The  Asian Development Bank  is talking
to European countries about an investment fund that would
redirect $500 million of solar subsidies toward projects in
developing countries where the money could be invested more
productively.  “You can get a bigger bang for your buck if some of the
subsidies used in those countries could be used in places like
India or Pakistan, where solar radiation is much more intense,”
 WooChong Um , deputy director general of the bank’s sustainable
development program, said in an interview today.  Germany, Spain and Italy are among the countries that have
offered incentives, including special tariffs fixing the price
at which producers can sell their power to the grid, to help
boost solar-generating capacity.  The ADB aims to help install 3,000 megawatts of solar
capacity over the next three years, Um said. Under the proposal,
governments would be encouraged to spend part of what they would
have spent on domestic subsidies to support the export of
technology and equipment to develop projects elsewhere, Um said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
