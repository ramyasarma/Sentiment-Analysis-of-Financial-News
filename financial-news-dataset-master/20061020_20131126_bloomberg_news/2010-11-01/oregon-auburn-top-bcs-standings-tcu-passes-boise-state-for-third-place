The  University of Oregon  jumped over
the Auburn University to claim the No. 1 spot in the Bowl
Championship Series standings, becoming the third school to hold
the top ranking in three weeks.  Oregon improved to 8-0 two days ago with a 53-32 road win
over the University of Southern California.  Auburn , which
dropped to second in the BCS standings, is 9-0 after a 51-31 win
over the University of Mississippi.  Boise State (9-0) fell from third to fourth, passed by
Texas Christian University (7-0).  The teams that finish the regular season at No. 1 and No. 2
in the BCS standings will play for the national championship on
Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona. The BCS is determined using the
USA Today coaches’ poll, the Harris Interactive poll and six
computer rankings.  The final standings will be released Dec. 5.  Oregon has a BCS average of .977, followed by Auburn at
.960, TCU at .891 and Boise State at .882. Oregon’s average
computer ranking moved to second this week from eighth, pushing
the Ducks past Auburn for the top spot.  Utah (8-0) is fifth in the BCS standings, followed by
defending national champion Alabama (7-1), Nebraska (7-1),
Oklahoma (7-1), Wisconsin (7-1) and Louisiana State (7-1).  To contact the reporter on this story:
