Berkeley Resources Ltd.  rose to the
highest since 2007 in Sydney after the uranium explorer said
it’s in talks with OAO Severstal over a potential A$275 million
($272 million) takeover by Russia’s largest steelmaker.  A Severstal offer at A$2 a share, a premium of about 40
percent to the average of Berkeley shares in the previous three
months, would gain support from Berkeley’s directors, the Perth-
based company said on Oct. 29. Severstal is controlled by
billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Mordashov , 45.  The Australian uranium company  rose 14 percent to A$1.83 at
the market’s 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, the highest since July
31, 2007. That values it at A$251 million. The benchmark S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.8 percent.  Severstal aims to acquire more than 50 percent, Berkeley
Chief Executive Officer Ian Stalker said.  Berkeley needs to fund its Salamanca uranium project in
Spain, due to start mining by late 2012. Should Severstal opt
against a bid, Berkeley would resume financing talks with other
parties that may include Korea Electric Power Corp., it said.  Berkeley is close to completing a feasibility study for the
Salamanca project, Stalker said on an Oct. 29 conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
