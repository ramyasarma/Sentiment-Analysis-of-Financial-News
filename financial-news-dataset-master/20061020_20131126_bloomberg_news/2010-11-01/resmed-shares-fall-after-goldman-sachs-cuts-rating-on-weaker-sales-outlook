ResMed Inc.  fell the most in more
than 17 months in Australian trading after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its rating on the stock to “hold,” citing a weaker-
than-expected sales outlook for the company.  ResMed, the world’s second-biggest maker of machines to
overcome night-time breathing disorders,  declined  4.1 percent to
A$3.27 as of the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, the most since May
11 last year. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8 percent.  Slower industry growth and softer economic conditions have
prevented the Poway, California-based company from achieving the
same sales growth with new products as it had previously,  Ian Abbott  and  Andrea Chong , health-care analysts at Goldman in
Melbourne, wrote in a note today. They cut their  rating  from
“buy” and maintained a 12-month stock-price estimate of A$4.  ResMed said Oct. 29 that fiscal first-quarter net income
jumped 35 percent on sales of its S9 Autoset and Elite products
that regulate breathing for people with sleep apnea. While sales
of the devices have “not yet reached full momentum,” revenue
growth of 20 percent or more is “unrealistic in the near
term,” Abbott and Chong said.  The company’s sales growth averaged 21 percent in the five
years ended June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
