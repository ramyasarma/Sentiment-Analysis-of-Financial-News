continuing of growth is a heartening sign.” The high share
valuations needed the “growth support” and the companies have
“delivered,” she said.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 323.29, or 1.6 percent, to 20,355.63, the highest level

oldest, from noon to 2:30 p.m. local time to resolve “technical
issues” involving “trade confirmation,” Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Ashishkumar Chauhan said.  Today’s snag was a setback for the Bombay bourse which is
introducing new products and cutting prices to win back market
share from its larger rival, the  National Stock Exchange . “The
BSE is losing its charm day by day,” said  Nilesh Karani , head
