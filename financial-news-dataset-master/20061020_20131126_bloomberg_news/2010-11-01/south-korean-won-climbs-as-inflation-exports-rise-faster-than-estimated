South Korea’s won rose the most in
two weeks and government bonds fell after inflation accelerated
to a 20-month high and exports climbed more than expected,
boosting expectations the central bank will raise interest
rates.  The currency approached a six-month high after the consumer
price index rose 4.1 percent in October from a year earlier,
according to government statistics released today. That
surpassed the 3.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of economists. The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said today the
trade surplus is expected to rise to a record this year after
exports rose 29.9 percent last month, beating the 16.2 percent
estimate in a separate survey.  “Higher inflation definitely helps push the won
stronger,” said  Ha Joon Woo , a currency trader at Daegu Bank in
Seoul. “This will add to criticism of the central bank for not
being able to control consumer prices.”  The won climbed 0.8 percent to 1,116.68 as of 11:36 a.m. in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached
1,110.05 on Oct. 14, the strongest level since May 3. The
currency gained 1.3 percent last month as overseas investors
pumped $3.6 billion into local stocks during that period.  The Bank of Korea kept its benchmark interest unchanged at
2.25 percent for a third month in October, citing foreign-
exchange volatility and global uncertainties as a threat to
growth. The Finance Ministry last week raised its economic
expansion forecast to 6 percent this year from 5.8 percent.  Bonds Fall  “The need to raise interest rates is increasing,” said
 Peter Park , a fixed-income analyst at Woori Investment &
Securities Co in Seoul. “Inflation has surpassed the central
bank’s target. Also, it should be easier to hike rates after the
Group of 20 nations’ meeting helped calm global uncertainties.”  The yield on the 3.75 percent bond due June 2013 rose 5
basis points to 3.30 percent, according to Korea Stock Exchange.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The central bank is
targeting inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent each year to
2012.  Finance chiefs from the G-20 pledged at a meeting last
month in South Korea to refrain from “competitive devaluation”
to ease fears of a trade war and help curb volatility in capital
flows. The nation’s trade surplus in the first 10 months of the
year was $35.97 billion, set to surpass last year’s $40.4
billion, the government said today. Exports account for half of
the nation’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
