Galleon Group hedge-fund firm co-
founder  Raj Rajaratnam  renewed his objections to the use of
government wiretaps in his insider-trading prosecution.  In a brief filed in Manhattan federal court today,
Rajaratnam called papers filed by the prosecution on the subject
last week “a model of misdirection.”  Rajaratnam claims the judge who authorized the wiretaps,
U.S. District Judge  Gerald Lynch , wouldn’t have done so if he
had been told that investigators had been gathering evidence for
a year before asking for a wiretap warrant.  The wiretaps are a key part of the evidence against
Rajaratnam, 53, who’s accused of using tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. He’s the central figure in an
investigation in which 21 were charged.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
