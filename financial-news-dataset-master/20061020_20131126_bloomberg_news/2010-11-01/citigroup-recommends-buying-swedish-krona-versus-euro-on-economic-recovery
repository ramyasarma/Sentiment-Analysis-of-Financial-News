Investors should buy the Swedish
krona against the euro on expectation Sweden’s economic recovery
gathers pace, according to Citigroup Inc.  “Euro-krona downside looks attractive yet again after
brutal month-end price action sent the cross surging,” London-
based foreign-exchange strategist Valentin Marinov wrote in a
research report today. “The cross has already retraced some of
the latest sharp correction and we think that it could move
closer to 9.20 again as investors continue to be attracted by
the sound economic fundamentals of the Swedish economy.”  The krona strengthened 0.3 percent to 9.2744 as of 1 p.m.
in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
