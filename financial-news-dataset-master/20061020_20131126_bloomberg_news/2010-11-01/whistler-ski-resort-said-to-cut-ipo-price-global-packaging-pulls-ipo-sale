Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc.,
owner of the Canadian ski resort that hosted the 2010 Winter
Olympics, reduced the share price for its C$300 million ($295
million) initial public offering for the second time in a week,
said two people familiar with the sale.  Whistler Blackcomb aims to sell shares for C$12 each, with
a dividend yield of 8.12 percent, according to the people, who
asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. The
company previously cut its price range from C$14 to C$15 a share
down to C$12.50 and C$13 apiece.  Intrawest ULC, a unit of New York-based buyout firm
 Fortress Investment Group LLC , is the selling shareholder behind
the offering, which is led by CIBC World Markets and RBC
Dominion Securities. A message left with Intrawest spokeswoman
Tabetha Boot wasn’t immediately returned.  The Whistler Blackcomb reduction comes after Global
Packaging Plus Inc., a California maker of plastic packaging,
canceled its C$92.5 million IPO earlier today, one of the people
said.  SNC-Lavalin scrapped a C$900 million IPO on Oct. 28 for
TransAxio Highway Concession Inc., which the Montreal-based
construction firm created to buy a stake in Ontario’s 407
Express Toll Road. Companies have pulled or postponed at least
12 IPOs in Canada this year.  A message left with Packaging Plus Chief Financial Officer
George Cohen wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
