Daimler AG , the world’s second-
biggest luxury carmaker, signed a 7 billion-euro ($9.8 billion)
credit line to refinance existing debt, according to two people
familiar with the deal.  Daimler offered lenders initial interest of 60 basis points
more than benchmark lending rates for the five-year revolving
credit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with an 160 basis-point margin for money drawn under a credit
line it agreed last year, Bloomberg data show.  The Stuttgart, Germany-based company last week raised its
full-year profit forecast after third-quarter net income surged
to 1.53 billion euros from 41 million euros a year earlier.  The owner of the Mercedes and Maybach nameplates offered
lenders a 15 basis-point fee if it uses more than one-third of
the credit line, and 30 basis points if it uses more than two-
thirds, according to Bloomberg data. The facility also pays a
commitment fee equivalent to 35 percent of the interest margin,
which will move depending on Daimler’s credit rating, the data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A Daimler spokesman declined to comment during a public
holiday in parts of Germany. Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale
SA and UniCredit SpA are coordinators of the refinancing,
Bloomberg data show.  The automaker has about $9 billion of credit lines expiring
next year, according to the company’s  earnings report .  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rank Daimler’s debt
BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade. Moody’s Investors
Service rates it a level higher at A3  To contact the reporter on this story:
