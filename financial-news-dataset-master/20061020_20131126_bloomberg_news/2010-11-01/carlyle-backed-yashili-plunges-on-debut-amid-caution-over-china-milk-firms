Yashili International Holdings Ltd. ,
the Chinese milk-product maker partly owned by Carlyle Group,
slumped on its Hong Kong trading debut as investors remain
cautious of the sector after a nationwide tainted milk scandal.  Yashili, based in Chaozhou, Guangdong province, fell 14
percent from its initial public offering price to HK$3.61 at the
12:30pm lunch break in Hong Kong, set for the third-worst first-
day performance in the city this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 60 companies that listed in Hong Kong
this year through Oct. 29 rose an average 12.6 percent on their
first trading days from their IPO prices, the data show.  Global Dairy Holdings Ltd. , the first of three Chinese
dairies listing in Hong Kong this quarter, lost 10 percent on
its debut on Oct. 28, at the time the fifth-worst debut of 2010.
The milk-powder producer, based in Daqing city, northeast China,
traded at HK$3.89 at the break today, down 11 percent from its
initial offer price.  Yashili  raised HK$2.7 billion ($348 million) selling 644
million shares at HK$4.20 each, near the midpoint of the offer
range, according to terms for the sale. Yashili sells milk
products through 1,200 regional distributors in China, the
company’s  website  said.  Three Chinese dairy companies are collectively seeking
about $850 million in their Hong Kong IPOs this quarter, betting
that enough trust in the industry has been restored after milk
tainted with melamine, a toxic chemical, killed at least six
infants in China in 2008.  Modern Farming (Group) Co. , based in
Anhui province, eastern China, aims to raise about $300 million
and list by the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
