China Molybdenum Co. , the nation’s
second-biggest producer, rose to the highest in almost two and a
half years in Hong Kong trading after the China Securities
Journal said the government may limit mining of the metal.  The  stock  climbed 5 percent to close at HK$7.81 at 4 p.m.,
taking its two-day gain to 34 percent since the journal on Oct.
29 cited an unidentified person as saying China would limit
molybdenum mining from next year by classifying it as a national
mining resource. Xi’an-based  Jinduicheng Molybdenum Co. , Asia’s
largest producer, rose by the 10 percent limit for a second day
to close at 28.12 yuan at 3 p.m. in Shanghai.  “The jump of the shares is related to the report China
will probably include molybdenum in the category of protected
mining, like rare earth,”  Owen Liang , a Shenzhen-based analyst
at Guotai Junan Securities Co., said today by phone.  He Feng , board secretary of China Molybdenum, based near
Luoyang city in Henan province, didn’t answer his mobile phone
when called for a comment. Molybdenum is used to harden steel
and is mainly used in construction.  China has been controlling molybdenum exports and set next
year’s export quota at 25,500 tons, unchanged from this year,
the Ministry of Commerce said on Oct. 28.  -- Xiao Yu . Editors:  Andrew Hobbs ,  Alan Soughley   To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
