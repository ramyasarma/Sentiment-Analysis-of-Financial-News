Deutsche Bank AG is close to gaining
a controlling stake in Deutsche Postbank AG to absorb the retail
lender into its balance sheet and increase synergies by the end
of the year, Financial Times Deutschland reported.  The bank is seeking to raise its stake to 50 percent plus 1
share as quickly as possible, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified banker familiar with the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
