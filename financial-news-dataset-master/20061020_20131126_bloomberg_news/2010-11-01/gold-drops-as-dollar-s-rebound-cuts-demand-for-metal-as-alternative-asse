Gold futures fell as a rebound by the
dollar eroded the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative
asset.  The greenback rose 0.4 percent against the euro, erasing a
decline of 0.5 percent, after a report showed U.S. manufacturing
expanded more than forecast in October. Last month, gold rose
3.7 percent, reaching a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14, as
the dollar fell 2.2 percent.  “The turnaround in the dollar triggered some selling in
the gold market,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago.  Gold futures for December delivery dropped $2.20, or 0.2
percent, to $1,355.50 at 10:52 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 22.6 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $24.79 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$25.055, the highest level in 30 years.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $13.80, or 0.8
percent, to $1,720.90 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced $7.10, or
1.1 percent, to $652.20 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$657.30, the highest since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
