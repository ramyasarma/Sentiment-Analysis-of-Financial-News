Seven stocks in the  Standard & Poor’s
MidCap 400 Index  are likely candidates for inclusion in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to Bespoke Investment
Group.  F5 Networks Inc. , NetFlix Inc., Newfield Exploration Co.,
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., New York Community Bancorp Inc.,
Joy Global Inc. and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. “are definitely
large enough to be considered for inclusion” in the benchmark
index, Bespoke said in an Oct. 29 note.  The S&P 500 had gone 63 days without a change in
 components , the longest such streak since July 2005, Harrison,
New York-based Bespoke said in the note, calling this “one
aspect” of the decline in market volatility since early 2009.  “Who are the most likely candidates?” Bespoke asked in
the note. “One place to look is at a list of the largest
members of the S&P MidCap 400 Index,” and all seven companies
named have market capitalizations of more than $7 billion. That
makes them bigger than 160 current S&P 500 companies, Bespoke
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
