Exxaro Resources Ltd. said an
“incident” on Oct. 24 at its KwaZulu-Natal Sands Furnace 2
will necessitate the relining of the furnace.  “The initial assessment indicates that the incident was
the result of a burn-through on the furnace shell during the
metal tap process,” the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. There were no injuries, Exxaro said, without giving more
details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
