A Namibian wind power plant capable
of producing 44 megawatts of electricity will be built in
Luderitz, Namibia at a cost of $150 million, said Haddis Tilan,
chief executive officer of United Africa Group of Namibia.  United Africa Group will own 60 percent of the power plant
while Sojitz Corp. of Japan and Korea Midlan Power Co. Ltd. will
own 20 percent each, Tilan said in a speech at the signing
ceremony in Windhoek, Namibia’s capital, today. The plant will
sell electricity to Namibia Power Corp. once it starts
operations in 2013, Tilan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
