Corn rose to the highest price in
more than two years on speculation that output in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter, may be lower than the
government forecast last month.  On Oct. 8, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its corn-
crop estimate for the second time in as many months, predicting
a 3.4 percent drop from a year earlier. The grain rallied 17
percent in October, the most since June 2008, and has increased
60 percent in the past year.  Concerns that “yields have been lower in northern areas
continue to support values,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
“Farmers report mixed yields, and many crop observers expect
USDA to cut yield estimates again.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $5.86 a bushel at 10:12 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, heading for a sixth straight gain. Earlier, the price
reached $5.9075, the highest level since August 2008.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
