The University of Iowa allowed a pair
of men’s basketball recruits to meet with actors  Ashton Kutcher 
and  Demi Moore , a violation of National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules, the  Des Moines Register reports .  The unidentified recruits met with Kutcher, 32, a former
Iowa student, and Moore, his 47-year-old wife, during a football
game in Iowa City on Sept. 11, the newspaper said. The NCAA,
which prohibits recruits from meeting with anyone who represent
a school’s athletic interests, asked the university to review
the case in a letter on Sept. 15.  The university expects to be charged with unintentional
secondary violations and declined to provide additional comment
until after the NCAA’s final decision, Athletic Director  Gary Barta  said in a statement.  Kutcher enrolled at Iowa in 1996 and left early to pursue
his acting and modeling careers. The recruits also met with
former Hawkeyes basketball players  Reggie Evans , Jeff Horner and
Dean Oliver, according to the report.  Kutcher’s manager, Stephanie Simon at Untitled
Entertainment, didn’t immediately return a voicemail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
