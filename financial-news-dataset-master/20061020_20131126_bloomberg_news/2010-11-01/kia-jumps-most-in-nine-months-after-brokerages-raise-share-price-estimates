Kia Motors Co. , South Korea’s  second-
biggest automaker , rose to the highest level in 12 years in
Seoul trading after brokerages raised their price estimates for
the stock, citing earnings results released last week.  Kia climbed 10 percent to close at 49,500 won, the highest
since April 1998, while the benchmark Kospi index rose 1.7
percent.  Morgan Stanley raised Kia’s target price to 55,800 won from
41,200 won after the company posted record quarterly earnings on
Oct. 29. Kia’s  net income  surged 66 percent to 666.6 billion won
($597 million) in the third quarter as new models increased
sales at home, in China and the U.S., beating the 504 billion
won average of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 26 percent.  “Expectations for Kia’s upcoming earnings are high,” said
 Kim Byung Kuk , a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin Securities Co.,
who raised his share-price estimate for the company to 58,000
won from 45,000 won. “Most of its overseas subsidiaries have
turned around, boosting hopes for higher earnings contributions
from abroad.”  Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s  largest carmaker , climbed
6.2 percent to close at a record 180,500 won. The company last
week reported a 38 percent increase in third-quarter earnings.  “Investors seem to be betting that Hyundai might have sold
more vehicles than usual in October because of a rise in sales
of revamped Avante small cars,” Daishin’s Kim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
