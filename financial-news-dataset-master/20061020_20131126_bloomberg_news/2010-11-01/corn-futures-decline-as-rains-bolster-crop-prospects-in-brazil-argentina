Corn dropped from a two-year high and
soybeans fell for the first time in six sessions as rain in
South American improved crop prospects.  Some fields in Brazil got as much as 2.8 inches (7.1
centimeters) of rain in the past three days, and more
precipitation in the next two weeks will boost depleted top-soil
moisture, World Weather Inc. said today in a report. Rains were
forecast to return to Argentina on Nov. 6.  “There was enough rain to alleviate dryness concerns for
the next few weeks,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “With rain
in the forecast, there is not much incentive to buy.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $5.7725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $5.9075, the
highest level for a most-active contract since August 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 1 cent to
close at $12.35 a bushel. On Oct. 28, the price reached
$12.4875, the highest level since September 2008, on rising
demand from China, the world’s biggest consumer.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of corn
and soybeans, followed by Brazil and Argentina. In October, corn
rose 17 percent and soybeans gained 12 percent, partly because
dry weather slowed planting in South America.  The dollar’s rebound eroded demand for some commodities,
Schultz said. The greenback rose as much as 0.6 percent against
the euro, erasing a decline of 0.5 percent, after U.S.
manufacturing expanded more than forecast in October.  “The dollar has rallied, and that cut investor buying
interest,” Schultz said. “The rally is beginning to act a
little tired.”  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
