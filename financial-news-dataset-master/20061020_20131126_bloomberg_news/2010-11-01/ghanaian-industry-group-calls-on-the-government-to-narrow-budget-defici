Ghana’s largest industry group called
on the government to narrow the budget deficit to help ease
borrowing costs for industry.  “We want the government to reduce the deficit to where it
can borrow domestically at single-digit interest rates,” said
Moses Agyemang, chief economist of the Accra-based  Private
Enterprise Foundation , an umbrella body for private businesses
in Ghana. “It would then make it easy for business to borrow
and expand.”  The yield on Ghana’s 91-day Treasury bills is 12.4 percent,
compared with the central bank’s benchmark rate of 13.5 percent
and inflation of 9.4 percent. Treasury yields have remained high
after the government posted fiscal deficits equivalent to 14.5
percent of gross domestic product in 2008 and 9.7 percent in
2009. The International Monetary Fund said on Oct. 1 that the
shortfall may exceed the 8 percent target this year.  The average lending rate borne by businesses is currently
28 percent and can go as high as 35 percent, Agyemang said in an
interview on Oct. 29.  The government needs to cut its wage bill and ensure better
value in project contracts, he said. The government’s wage bill
takes up almost 70 percent of revenue, Joe Abbey, director
general of  Centre for Policy Analysis , said on Oct 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
