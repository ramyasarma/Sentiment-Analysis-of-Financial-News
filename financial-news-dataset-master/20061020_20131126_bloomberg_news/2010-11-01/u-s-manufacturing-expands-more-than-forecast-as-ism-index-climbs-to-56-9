The Institute for Supply Management’s
 factory index  rose to 56.9 in October from 54.4 a month earlier,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Readings greater than
50 signal growth.  Economists forecast the ISM manufacturing gauge would
decline to 54, according to the median of 75 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from 52 to 56.8.  Manufacturing in China  expanded  in October at the fastest
pace in six months, while U.K. factory growth unexpectedly
accelerated as hiring and export orders improved, other reports
showed today.  A China purchasing managers’ index released by the
logistics federation rose to 54.7 last month from 53.8. A second
PMI, from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, jumped to 54.8
from 52.9.  A  U.K. gauge  based on a survey of companies by Markit
Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
rose to 54.9 last month from 53.5, according to an e-mailed
statement in London. Measures above 50 indicate expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
