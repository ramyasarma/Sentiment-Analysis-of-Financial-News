SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s biggest
refiner, will process the same volume of crude oil in November
as last month, a company official said.  The  refiner  may process about 910,000 barrels of crude a
day, or an operating rate of 82 percent, said the official, who
asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to talk
to the media. SK Energy has a total processing capacity of 1.115
million barrels a day.  Chung Tae Hoon, a company spokesman, declined to comment on
the processing volumes when reached by telephone in Seoul. SK
Energy doesn’t publish monthly crude operating rates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
