New York  state faces a $315 million
budget deficit because tax revenue hasn’t increased as much as
projected three months ago, when lawmakers approved the spending
plan, the Division of Budget said.  Tax collections for this fiscal year are now forecast at
$61.4 billion, down $343 million from August estimates, the
division said in a  report  yesterday. The budget, including
increased federal aid, is now estimated at $135.3 billion.  “The slowdown in economic growth in the second and third
quarters of calendar year 2010 has been more pronounced than
expected,” the report said. Slower growth reduced tax revenue
and increased contributions to the Medicaid health-insurance
program for the poor, it said.  For fiscal 2012, which begins April 1, the state faces a
deficit of $9 billion, up from $8.2 billion previously
estimated, according to the  report .  To close this year’s gap and shrink future deficits,
Governor  David Paterson  will ask lawmakers to approve across-
the-board spending cuts, according to the updated budget.
Reductions of 1.5 percent to 2 percent over the remainder of the
fiscal year would save about $375 million, the division said.  Paterson said Oct. 26 he will recall lawmakers to Albany on
Nov. 15 to vote on appropriations and legislation to reorganize
the bankrupt New York City Off-Track Betting Corp. He said other
items may be on the agenda.  Tax Collections  In a separate report last month, Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said state tax collections through Sept. 30 were $528.8
million less than expected. Business taxes were $243.3 million
below plan, according to the comptroller’s  report .  The division  said  business taxes will be recovered in
coming months, while personal-income-tax collections will be
$300 million less than projected for this fiscal year.  Paterson last week announced plans to fire 898 workers by
Dec. 31 to help achieve $250 million of savings assumed in this
year’s budget. Existing contracts for the state’s 130,000
unionized workers expire on March 30, and the state’s financial
plan for future years “does not include any costs for potential
wage increases beyond that point,” the report said.  Lawmakers left the state capital in August, four months
past the start of the fiscal year, after completing a $133.8
billion budget to close a $9.2 billion deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
