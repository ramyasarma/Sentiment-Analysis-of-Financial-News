European stocks  climbed after
manufacturing in China and the U.S. expanded more than forecast,
boosting confidence in the global economy before this week’s
Federal Reserve meeting.  Kazakhmys Plc and Xstrata Plc led mining shares higher as
copper jumped. Hays Plc and  Michael Page International Plc 
rallied more than 3 percent as Credit Suisse Group AG
recommended the recruitment firms. TNT NV paced retreating
shares after Europe’s second-biggest express-delivery company
reported an unexpected decline in profit.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 0.2 percent to 266.4 at
the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London, as three stocks
advanced for every two that declined. The gauge climbed 2.4
percent last month on speculation the Fed will unveil another
round of bond purchases to boost growth, a tactic known as
quantitative easing.  “We still see growth in the economy, there is quite a lot
of fiscal stimulus left and it’s for that reason we think
corporate assets are still good value,”  Richard Lacaille , the
London-based chief investment officer at State Street Global
Advisors, which manages $1.8 trillion, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. “Quantitative easing has been baked into
prices for some time. It will have an impact, but whether it
will be enough for some people is a different question.”  Fed Stimulus  Fed policy makers meet Nov. 2-3 to consider steps to boost
the world’s largest economy. Further monetary easing from the
central bank could cause Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  to do more for his economy and Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  to leave the door open to more aid.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 11 of the 16 western
European markets that were open. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100  advanced
0.3 percent, France’s CAC 40 gained 0.2 percent and Germany’s
DAX was little changed. Greece’s ASE sank 2.8 percent as EFG
Eurobank Ergasias SA tumbled.  Markets in Austria and Luxembourg were closed for the All
Saints Day holiday.  A Chinese purchasing managers’ index released by the
logistics federation today rose to 54.7 in October from 53.8 the
prior month. A second  PMI , from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics, jumped to 54.8 from 52.9.  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index rose to 56.9 last month, the highest since May, from 54.4.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth and the median economist
forecast was for a decline to 54, according to Bloomberg data.  Mining Companies  Kazakhmys, Kazakhstan’s biggest copper producer, increased
1.8 percent to 1,339 pence, leading a  measure of basic-resources
shares  to the biggest gain among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx
600. Xstrata, the world’s fourth-largest copper producer,
advanced 3.7 percent to 1,254.5 pence. Antofagasta Plc, owner of
copper mines in Chile, rose 1.4 percent to 1,341 pence.  “The growth pattern still seems to be continuing” in
emerging markets, said State Street’s Lacaille on Bloomberg
Television’s ‘On the Move’ with  Francine Lacqua . “That is
feeding through into earnings of European companies.”  Hays, the U.K.’s biggest recruitment firm, gained 3 percent
to 113.8 pence and Michael Page, the second-largest, increased 4
percent to 489.8 pence.  Credit Suisse raised its recommendation for both stocks to
“outperform” from “neutral,” citing the companies’ focus on
international operations.  TNT Tumbles  TNT  sank 4.2 percent to 18.30 euros, the biggest drop since
June, after the delivery company reporting an unexpected drop in
profit as volumes fell at the letter-deliver division.  Third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes dropped 20
percent to 143 million euros ($200 million), the company said.
Analysts were predicting Ebit would rise 6.7 percent to 191
million euros, according to 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Ryanair Holdings Plc slipped 3.8 percent to 3.97 euros as
Europe’s biggest discount airline also reported earnings that
missed analysts’ projections. The company had second-quarter net
income of 330.3 million euros, compared with the 343 million-
euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Of the 146 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 67 percent have beaten  analyst estimates 
for per-share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In the U.S., 81 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped
 predictions  in the period.  Serco Group Plc, operator of London’s Docklands Light
Railway, dropped 4.4 percent to 587 pence following a failed
attempt to recoup money from its suppliers. The company, which
was one of several contractors that the U.K. government asked to
lower prices, withdrew letters requesting rebates from suppliers
and apologized.  Greek, Spanish Stocks  Greek and Spanish stocks led declines in Europe as the cost
of insuring European sovereign debt from default climbed on
concern bondholders will be forced to share the expense of
future government bailouts.  Marfin Popular Bank Plc dropped 4.1 percent to 1.42 euros
in Athens after seeking approval to raise 488.6 million euros in
a rights offer and as much as 600 million euros in convertible
capital securities. National Bank of Greece SA fell 4.6 percent
to 7.51 euros and Eurobank slumped 5.2 percent to 4.22 euros.  Banco Santander SA, the biggest Spanish bank, slid 3
