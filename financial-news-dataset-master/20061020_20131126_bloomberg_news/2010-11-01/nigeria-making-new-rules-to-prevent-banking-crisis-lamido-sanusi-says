Nigeria’s  central bank  says it is
making new rules for lenders to prevent a repeat of last year’s
crisis in the banking industry, including the creation of
“international advisory panels” for some banks.  The changes will “forestall the pitfalls of the past where
corporate governance malpractices brought a number of banks to
their knees,” Governor Lamido Sanusi told a forum of bank
directors in the commercial capital, Lagos, today.  A debt crisis last year forced the central bank to rescue
10 of the country’s lenders by injecting 620 billion naira ($4.1
billion) of capital into the system. Eight of the lenders’ chief
executive officers were fired.  The “bailout of some notable local banks in the second
half of 2009 underscores the importance of sound corporate
governance practices and professional ethics,” Sanusi said.  Specialists will continuously oversee and review governance
practices in the industry, while banks whose assets exceed
certain predetermined threshold may be required “to form an
international advisory panel as a way of enhancing transparency
and good governance,” Sanusi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
