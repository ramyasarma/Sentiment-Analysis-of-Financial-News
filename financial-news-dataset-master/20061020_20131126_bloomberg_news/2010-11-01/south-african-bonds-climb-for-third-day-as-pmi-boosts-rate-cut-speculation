South Africa bonds rose for a third
day after the nation’s purchasing managers’ index stayed below
50 for a second month, boosting speculation the central bank
will lower its benchmark interest rate to stimulate the economy.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbed 16
cents to 126.28 rand as of 4:50 p.m. in Johannesburg, reducing
the yield by four basis points to 7.02 percent. That would be
the lowest close since at least November 2004, when Bloomberg
began tracking the data.  The seasonally adjusted  PMI  rose to 49.8 from a revised
48.6 in September, Kagiso Securities Ltd., which sponsors the
report, said in an e-mailed statement. A reading below 50
indicates a contraction in factory output.  “Growth momentum in the manufacturing sector remains
weak,” Tebogo Mosepele, an analyst with  Standard Bank Group
Ltd. , wrote in a client note from Johannesburg today. “The slow
recovery in this sector, coupled with continued job-shedding and
the benign inflation outlook, reinforces Standard Bank’s
expectation of a 50 basis-point interest-rate cut this month.”  South Africa’s monetary policy makers have cut their key
rate  eight times  since December 2008 to a record low 6 percent
to stimulate the economy. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said
last week that government is targeting “looser monetary
policy” to help grow the economy and reduce unemployment, which
reached 25.3 percent in the third quarter.  Reports last week showed  consumer price growth  slowed to a
five-year low of 3.2 percent in September, while producer
inflation decelerated to a slower-than-estimated 6.8 percent.  Forward-Rate Agreements  Forward-rates agreements, or FRAs, showed money-market
investors pared bets the  Reserve Bank  will reduce the main rate
when it announces its next decision on Nov. 18. The cost of
 three-month contracts for cash in three months  rose half a basis
point to 5.595 percent.  The rate fell to 5.59 percent on Oct. 29, the lowest level
since the central bank first introduced its repurchase rate in
1999. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The rand strengthened 0.2 percent to 6.9861 per dollar,
from a previous close of 6.9990. Against the euro, the rand
gained 0.5 percent to 9.7170.  To contact the reporter on this story:
