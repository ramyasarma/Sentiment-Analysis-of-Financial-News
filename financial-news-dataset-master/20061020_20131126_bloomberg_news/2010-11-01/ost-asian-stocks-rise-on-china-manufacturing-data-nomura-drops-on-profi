Asian  stocks  rose, paced by the Hang
Seng Index’s biggest gain in more than four months, as growth in
Chinese manufacturing bolstered confidence in the global economy.  Jiangxi Copper Co.  climbed 5.8 percent in Shanghai and
Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, gained 3.7
percent in Hong Kong as oil and copper prices rose. Taiwan’s HTC
Corp., which makes mobile-phone handsets, surged 7 percent after
saying sales may reach a record.  Honda Motor Co.  sank 5 percent
in Tokyo after lowering its second-half profit estimate.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.9 percent to 130.49 as
of 7:23 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge reversed losses of as much as
0.2 percent after a report showed China’s  manufacturing  grew at
the fastest pace in six months in October, adding to signs that
economic growth is withstanding government efforts to curb
property speculation and improve energy efficiency.  “The strong data coming out of China is suggesting the
period of economic slowdown is coming to an end,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $135 billion. “That’s very good for Asia, Australia and
other countries that rely on China for export growth.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.4 percent, the most since June
21, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.5 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.8 percent. The  Sensitive
Index  advanced 1.6 percent in Mumbai, where the exchange halted
trading for 2 1/2 hours to fix a technical fault.  U.S. Economy  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  lost 0.5 percent and the
broader Topix index sank 0.9 percent as forecasts from companies
including Honda and lower profit from Nomura Holdings Inc.
dragged stocks lower.  Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7
percent. Most stocks on the gauge advanced on Oct. 29 as
Microsoft Corp. beat profit estimates and a government report on
economic growth matched forecasts.  Energy and material stocks accounted for 31 percent of the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index  advance  today as China’s logistics
federation said the Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 54.7. The
reading compared with 53.8 for both the previous month and the
median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The data shows that China is growing solidly,” said
 Nader Naeimi , a Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages about $85 billion. “Fears of a ‘hard
landing’ on the back of the country’s tightening measures were
misplaced.”  Copper, Zinc  Jiangxi Copper rose 5.8 percent to 46.27 yuan after the
manufacturing report from China, the world’s largest user of
industrial metals. Zinc, aluminum and lead climbed, while copper
advanced from London to Shanghai as investors also sought
alternatives to a declining U.S. dollar. In Seoul,  Korea Zinc
Co. , the world’s second-biggest zinc smelter, surged 5.1 percent
to 298,000 won.  Cnooc climbed 3.7 percent to HK$16.66 in Hong Kong, while
 PetroChina Co. , Asia’s biggest company by market value, advanced
2 percent to HK$9.65. Crude-oil futures in New York gained as
much as 0.7 percent in after-hours trading today.  China Construction Bank Corp.  rose 3.4 percent to HK$7.64
after reporting a 31 percent jump in third-quarter net income
that was more than analysts estimated.  Technology Stocks  HTC, the world’s largest manufacturer of handsets using
Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. operating systems, climbed 7
percent to NT$739 in Taipei, leading the region’s technology
stocks higher.  HTC’s sales  may total NT$100 billion ($3.3
billion) in the three months ending Dec. 31, the Taoyuan,
Taiwan-based company said after the close of trading on Oct. 29.  Acer Inc., the world’s second-largest computer maker,
gained 4.5 percent to NT$92.90 after saying it expects to ship
up to 5 million phones next year compared with about 1 million
handsets in 2010.  In Seoul,  Kia Motors Co. , South Korea’s  second-biggest
automaker , jumped 10 percent to 49,500 won, the biggest gain on
the Asian benchmark, after brokerages including Morgan Stanley
raised their price estimates for the stock, citing earnings
results released last week.  Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea’s largest carmaker which
last week reported a 38 percent increase in third-quarter profit,
climbed 6.2 percent to 180,500 won.  Additional Easing  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated earlier today as the
U.S. dollar slid for a third day against the euro on bets the
Federal Reserve will increase debt purchases amid signs of a
stagnant recovery in the world’s largest economy. The yen
weakened to 81.41 per dollar from 80.40 last week, after earlier
touching 80.22, the strongest level since April 1995.  “People want to know how Japan and the U.S. will set their
monetary policies,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Pressure on the yen is
strong because of speculation about additional quantitative
easing by the Federal Reserve.”  Fed policy makers are due to meet Nov. 2-3, while Bank of
Japan officials convene on Nov. 4-5.  The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in almost
four years, government data showed on Oct. 29, a sign the
expansion is developing staying power. The increase matched the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and
followed a 1.7 percent gain in the previous three months.  Honda, Nomura Slump  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 7.4 percent in 2010
through last week, compared with gains of 6.1 percent by the S&P
500 and 4.8 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Asian benchmark, which climbed 2.4 percent in October for its
second straight monthly gain, are valued at 14.2 times estimated
 profit , compared with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Honda sank 5 percent to 2,789 yen in Tokyo. Japan’s second-
largest carmaker expects to earn 92 billion yen ($1.1 billion)
in net income in the six months ending March 31, compared with
an earlier forecast for 105 billion yen in profit, according to
a Bloomberg calculation based on the company’s first-half
earnings statement on Oct. 29.  Nomura, Japan’s biggest brokerage, sank 5 percent to 397
yen after its quarterly profit plunged by 96 percent on losses
at its overseas operations.  Acom Co. , Japan’s largest consumer lender by market value,
tumbled 11 percent to 819 yen. The stock extended a 5.4 percent
decline on Oct. 29, when the company said it had a first-half
net loss of 43.9 billion yen ($544 million) and that it won’t
pay a dividend this fiscal year.  To contact the reporters for this story:
