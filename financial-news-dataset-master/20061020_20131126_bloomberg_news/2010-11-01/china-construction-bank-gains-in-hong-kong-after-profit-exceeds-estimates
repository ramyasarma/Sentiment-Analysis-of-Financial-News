China Construction Bank Corp. , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, rose to an almost
three-year high in Hong Kong after beating analysts’ estimates
for third-quarter profit.  The  stock  rose 3.4 percent, the biggest gain in more than
four months, to HK$7.64 at the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong.
Construction Bank said net income jumped 31 percent last quarter
to 39.8 billion yuan on Oct. 29, exceeding the 36.7 billion yuan
median  estimate  of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  China’s 16 publicly traded banks posted an average profit
gain of 49 percent in the first nine months on rising loan
demand and a drop in soured debt, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Construction Bank’s earnings growth and improved
asset quality may boost demand for the stock when Construction
Bank begins Asia’s biggest rights offer.  “CCB reported outstanding results and should further
emphasize the fundamental strength of the bank,”  Sheng Nan , a
Shanghai-based analyst at UBOC Kayhian Investment Co., wrote in
a note today. The announcement of final details for the bank’s
rights offering will “remove the capital-raising overhang for
the bank,” he said.  The state-controlled lender, established in 1954 to fund
roads, bridges, dams and other public works, may raise less than
the maximum 75 billion yuan it initially planned to collect from
the share sale, four people with knowledge of the matter said on
Oct. 28.  Smaller rival  China Merchants Bank Co. , based in Shenzhen,
posted a 53 percent gain in profit for the third quarter on Oct.
29, while Beijing-based  China Citic Bank Corp.  reported a 51.5
percent earnings increase.  Merchants Bank gained 3.4 percent to HK$22.75 in Hong Kong,
while Citic Bank rose 2.7 percent to HK$5.78.  -- Luo Jun . Editors:  James Gunsalus ,  Chitra Somayaji   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
