Swiss stocks erased gains, as
declines by UBS AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd. offset increases
by Holcim Ltd. and Adecco SA.  The benchmark Swiss Market Index was little changed, adding
0.1 percent to 6,477.9 at 11:16 a.m. in Zurich, after earlier
gaining as much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
