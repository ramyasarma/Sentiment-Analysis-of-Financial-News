Las Vegas Sands Corp. ,  Wynn Resorts
Ltd.  and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.  shares rose in New York
trading after Macau casino revenue soared 50 percent to a record
in October, boosted by China’s Golden Week holiday.  Las Vegas Sands climbed $1.35, or 2.9 percent, to $47.23 at
4:14 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On the
Nasdaq, Wynn rose $2.10, or 2 percent to $109.26, and Melco
Crown gained 25 cents, or 4 percent, to $6.52.  Total gambling  revenue  for  SJM Holdings Ltd. ,  Sands China
Ltd.  and the four other casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony increased to 18.9 billion patacas ($2.4
billion) last month from 12.6 billion patacas a year earlier,
Macau’s  Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  said.  Sales for casinos in Macau, the only place in China where
they’re legal, have surged 59 percent to 152 billion patacas
this year as the global economic recovery boosted spending. The
 economy  of mainland China, where most of Macau’s visitors come
from, will probably grow 10 percent this year, according to the
median forecast of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It is encouraging to see monthly growth of this
magnitude,”  Bill Lerner , a Las Vegas-based analyst at Union
Gaming Group LLC said today in a note. “We believe the profit
story for Macau concessionaires over the next year could be
significantly higher than current expectations.”  Visitor Arrivals  Visitor arrivals in the world’s biggest gambling hub  rose 
13 percent to 685,000 during China’s Oct. 1-Oct. 7 National Day
break, with about 70 percent coming from mainland China,
according to the city’s tourism agency. Visitors from the
mainland, which excludes Hong Kong and Taiwan, comprised about
53 percent total arrivals in the first nine months of the year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sands China , the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas-based company,  rose  1.2 percent to
HK$17.10 in Hong Kong trading, before the data was released.
Billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s  SJM  climbed 3.1 percent to HK$11.88.  Wynn Macau Ltd.  gained 0.7 percent to HK$17.26 and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd.  advanced 1.6 percent to HK$7.42.  Melco
International Development Ltd. , which has a venture with
Australian billionaire  James Packer ’s  Crown Ltd. , climbed 4.3
percent to HK$4.59.  Las Vegas Sands, the parent of  Sands China , in June
forecast Macau’s casino revenue will increase more than 30
percent in the second half.  The territory surpassed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s
biggest gambling hub in 2006, after the government ended  Stanley Ho ’s four-decade gambling monopoly and allowed the entry of
foreign operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
