Google Inc. , owner of the world’s
most popular search engine, sued the U.S. Interior Department,
claiming it didn’t provide a “full and open” competition for a
messaging-service contract.  In the complaint filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims,
Google and Onix Networking Corp., a licensed Google seller, seek
an order barring the department from proceeding with  Microsoft
Corp.  software without conducting a fair procurement proceeding.  Google , based in Mountain View, California, claims it
didn’t have the opportunity to compete for the contract. The
Interior Department had been seeking to acquire a single
communications service for the agency’s 88,000 users.  “Notwithstanding Google’s efforts and DOI’s assurances to
Google representatives that DOI would conduct a full and open
competition for its messaging requirements,” the bid request
“specified that only the Microsoft Business Productivity Online
Suite-Federal could be proposed,” Google wrote in the complaint
filed Oct. 29.  The contract is worth $49.3 million over five years,
according to the complaint.  An Interior Department spokesman didn’t immediately return
a message seeking comment.  The case is Google Inc. v. U.S., 10-743, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
