Three bottles of Chateau Lafite’s 
1869 vintage each sold for a record price of HK$1.8 million 
($230,000) at a sale in Hong Kong on Oct. 29, underlining 
Asia’s dominance of the auction market for trophy label wines.  All three were bought by the same Asian telephone bidder, 
said Sotheby’s, which offered almost 2,000 bottles of Lafite 
shipped directly from the cellars of the chateau in Pauillac, 
near Bordeaux. Bloomberg's Rosalind Chin reports for Bloomberg 
Television. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:04  -0- Nov/01/2010 06:19 GMT
