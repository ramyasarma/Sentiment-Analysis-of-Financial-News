German lawmakers are considering
scrapping the country’s military-intelligence service as part of
defense budget cuts, Handelsblatt said, citing a parliamentary
proposal.   Combining the intelligence organization, known as MAD, with
another espionage service could save the government 70 million
euros, the newspaper cited the proposal as saying. MAD, which
employs 1,300 people, could be merged with the larger BND
foreign-intelligence service or the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution, Germany’s counterintelligence,
it said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
