U.S. stocks erased gains as shares of
financial and consumer companies turned lower, wiping out an
early rally triggered by growth in Chinese manufacturing and
speculation the Federal Reserve will announce large-scale asset
purchases to pump cash into the economy.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. lost 1 percent to pace declines in
banks.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,182.85 after rallying as much as 1.1 percent
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
