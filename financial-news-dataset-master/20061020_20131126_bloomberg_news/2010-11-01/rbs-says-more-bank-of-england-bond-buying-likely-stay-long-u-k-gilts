Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said
the Bank of England will probably expand its asset-purchase
facility this week to boost the economy and advised investors to
own U.K. government bonds.  “We are bruised but unbowed in our bullish call for the
gilt market,”  Andy Chaytor , a London-based rates strategist,
wrote in a report dated Oct. 31. “We expect gilt yields to
fall.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose 12 basis points to 3.07
percent last week after data showed gross domestic product
increased 0.8 percent in the third quarter, double the
projection of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Central bank policy makers may announce a fresh 50 billion
pounds ($80 billion) of purchases on Nov. 4, Chaytor wrote.
 Gilts  offer “great risk-reward,” he said. They have moved back
to “not-much-chance-of-quantitative-easing-happening levels,”
and investors should “stay long,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
