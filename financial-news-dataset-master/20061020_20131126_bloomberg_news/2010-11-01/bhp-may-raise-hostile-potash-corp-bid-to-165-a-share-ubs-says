BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
biggest mining company, may raise its offer for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. as much as 27 percent should the deal win
Canadian federal government approval this week, UBS AG said.  BHP  could raise its offer to as much as $165-a-share from
$130, London-based UBS analyst  Olivia Ker  wrote in a note today.  “BHP may be prepared to pay up to this higher limit given
the strength in fertilizer prices as well as an approximate 30
percent re-rating of other names in the agricultural space since
the bid was announced,” UBS wrote in the report.  Potash Corp. , the biggest producer of the crop nutrient,
has rejected BHP’s offer and said last week it held talks with
15 potential bidders. BHP’s $40 billion proposal is subject to a
review by the Canadian government, which can block the deal if
it finds the transaction doesn’t provide “net benefits” to the
country. A decision is scheduled to be announced on Nov. 3.  “The bid is becoming increasingly more political, making
the outcome less certain,” UBS said in the report. “If the
deal is approved we see limited downside to BHP overpaying.”  BHP  advanced  1.3 percent to 2,242.5 pence by 1:48 p.m. in
London trading. The Melbourne-based company has gained 17
percent from its closing price in London on Aug. 17, the day
before it announced the bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
