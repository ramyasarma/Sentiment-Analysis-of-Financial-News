Latin American economic growth
depends on governments improving rights and social benefits for
their citizens, said Alicia Barcena, head of the United Nations’
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.  The region has an “urgency” to end inequality and needs
to create a “more inclusive” financial system, Barcena said at
an event in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
