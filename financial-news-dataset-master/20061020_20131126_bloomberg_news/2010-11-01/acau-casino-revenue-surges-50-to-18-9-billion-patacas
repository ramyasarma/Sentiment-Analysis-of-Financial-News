Casino revenue in Macau rose 50
percent in October after tourists to the world’s biggest
gambling hub surged during China’s Golden Week holiday.  Total gambling  revenue  for  SJM Holdings Ltd. ,  Sands China
Ltd.  and the four other casino operators in the former
Portuguese colony increased to 18.9 billion patacas ($2.4
billion) last month from 12.6 billion patacas a year earlier,
Macau’s  Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  said.  Sales for casinos in Macau, the only place in China where
they’re legal, have grown 59 percent to 152 billion patacas so
far this year as the global economic recovery boosted spending.
The  economy  of mainland China, where most of Macau’s visitors
come from, will probably grow 10 percent this year, according to
the median forecast of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Macau’s visitor arrivals  rose  13 percent to 685,000 during
China’s Oct. 1-7 National Day Golden Week, with about 70 percent
coming from mainland China, according to the city’s tourism
agency. Visitors from mainland China, which excludes Hong Kong
and Taiwan, comprised about 53 percent of the total in the first
nine months of the year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sands China , the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas-based company,  rose  1.2 percent to
close at HK$17.10 in Hong Kong trading before the data was
released. Billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s  SJM  climbed 3.1 percent to
HK$11.88.  Wynn Macau Ltd.  gained 0.7 percent to HK$17.26 and  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd.  advanced 1.6 percent to HK$7.42.  Melco
International Development Ltd. , which has a venture with
Australian billionaire  James Packer ’s  Crown Ltd. , climbed 4.3
percent to HK$4.59.  Las Vegas Sands Corp., the parent of  Sands China , in June
forecast Macau’s casino revenue will increase more than 30
percent in the second half.  The territory surpassed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s
biggest gambling hub in 2006, after the government ended  Stanley Ho ’s four-decade gambling monopoly and allowed the entry of
foreign operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
