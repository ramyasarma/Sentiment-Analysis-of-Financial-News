Asian gasoil, or diesel, rose as
refiners’ profit from making the product jumped the most in a
month. Litasco SA sought to hire a supertanker to carry fuel oil
from Rotterdam to Singapore, moving supplies between two
regional storage hubs.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil  swaps for December rebounded 82 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $93.32 a barrel at 11:40 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates. The product’s
premium to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark, regained 47 cents
to $12.54. This  crack spread , a measure of refining profit,
increased the most since Oct. 1.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil slipped 5 cents to $1.25 a
barrel, ending a two-day climb, based on PVM data. This  regrade 
has rallied from 70 cents in one month, signaling that it is
profitable to produce aviation fuel compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  Singapore  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for December rose $1,
or 0.2 percent, to $480.25 a metric ton, according to PVM. The
product’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 20 cents to $6.90 a
barrel, indicating losses from making the residue were the
steepest since Oct. 19.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade declined 25 cents to $10.75 a ton, giving up
gains from Oct. 29, PVM data showed. A narrower  viscosity spread 
shows the price of bunker, or marine fuel, increased more than
that of higher-quality fuel oil.  Litasco, the trading unit of OAO Lukoil, Russia’s biggest
non-state producer, provisionally booked the Neptune Glory to
load 270,000 tons of fuel oil at Rotterdam on Nov. 5 for
delivery to Singapore, according to a report from Clarkson Plc.
The Very Large Crude Carrier may be chartered for $3 million.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for first-half December delivery were bid at $772.50 a
ton against offers at $775.50, according to brokers Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte. That’s up from the Oct. 29 close of
$768.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha on Oct. 29 slumped to $3.75 a
barrel, the weakest since Oct. 20, Bloomberg calculations
showed. A narrow reforming margin indicates motor fuel is less
profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
