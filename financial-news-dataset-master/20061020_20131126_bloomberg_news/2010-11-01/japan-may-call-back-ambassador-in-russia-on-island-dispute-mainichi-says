Japan may consider calling back its
ambassador from Moscow after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
visited a disputed island chain yesterday, the Mainichi
newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  Japan is unlikely to do anything more than lodge official
protests before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting
scheduled for Nov. 13-14, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
