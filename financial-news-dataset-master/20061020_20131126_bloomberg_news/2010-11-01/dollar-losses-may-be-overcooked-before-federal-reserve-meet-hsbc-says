The dollar may have weakened too far
and could get a boost from lower-than-forecast asset purchases
by the Federal Reserve, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  “While we have been pushing a broadly dollar negative view
for some time, we find ourselves thinking the fall is a little
overcooked,” HSBC analysts led by London-based David Bloom 
wrote in an investor note today. “The questions for markets are
how much QE and how often? If it is smaller than the market may
be hoping for, this would trigger a risk off move and push the
dollar higher.”  The dollar strengthened against the euro today after a
report showed U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in
October. The U.S. currency appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3885 as
of 4:31 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
