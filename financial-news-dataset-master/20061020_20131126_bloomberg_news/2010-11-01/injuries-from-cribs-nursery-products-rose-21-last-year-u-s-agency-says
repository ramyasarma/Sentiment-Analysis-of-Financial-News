Injuries caused by cribs, strollers,
high chairs and other nursery products spiked 21 percent in 2009
from the previous year, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission said.  Regulators estimated there were 77,300 emergency-room
visits related to products aimed at children younger than 5
years old, compared with 63,700 in 2008, the CPSC said in a
report published today. The agency doesn’t have an explanation
at this time, said  Scott Wolfson , a CPSC spokesman.  The products covered in the report have been subject to
recalls in the past year. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., Target Corp., Kmart and Toys R Us have recalled cribs.
Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s Graco subsidiary recalled high chairs
in March and an infant carrier-stroller combination last month.  The increase in injuries is “troubling,” said Nancy
Cowles, executive director of Chicago-based Kids in Danger,
which tracks fatalities and injuries in children’s products.
“These are all products that have consistently high numbers of
injuries.”  The number of injuries rose 2 percent in 2008 and fell 5.9
percent in 2007. CPSC epidemiologists said the reasons for the
2009 increase may be technical and they don’t think the one-year
jump is statistically significant, Wolfson said.  Infant carriers, cribs and strollers accounted for more
than half of the injuries, according to the report, which uses a
sample of emergency-room data to estimate a national trend.  Infant carriers, including those that can be used as car
seats, were involved in 15,800 injuries last year, compared with
11,700 in 2008 -- a 35 percent increase. There were 14,600
children sent to the emergency room with crib injuries last
year, a 27 percent increase from 11,500 in 2008, the CPSC said.  “The CPSC intends to study the exposure children have to
all the key nursery products,” Wolfson said. “We have been and
are continuing to work on new safety rules,” including those
required under a 2008 law, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
