Sony Corp. , the maker of Bravia
televisions and Cyber-shot cameras, aims to boost revenue from
business-use equipment by 67 percent in four years, driven by
demand for projectors and camcorders that produce higher
resolution images.  Sales at the business, including security cameras and
medical-use displays, may climb to 500 billion yen ($6.2
billion) as early as the year to March 2014, from about 300
billion yen in the 12 months ended March 2010, the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement today. Sony said it plans to reach
the target no later than the year ending March 2016.  Sony seeks growth drivers at its main electronics business
after declining prices of sets led the company to abandon a goal
to turn the TV operations profitable this fiscal year. The
business-use products are part of the company’s Consumer,
Professional & Devices group, whose profit more than doubled to
16.9 billion yen in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, missing
the average analysts’ estimate of 22 billion yen.  “We are aiming at a profit margin of 10 percent in the
mid-term,” Tadashi Saito, Sony’s executive vice president in
charge of business-use equipment, told reporters in Tokyo,
without defining the timeframe. The business turned profitable
during the six months ended Sept. 30, after posting a loss in
the year ended March 31, he said without providing figures.  Sony  fell 1.5 percent to 2,651 yen at the 3 p.m. close on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared with a 0.5 percent decline
for the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
