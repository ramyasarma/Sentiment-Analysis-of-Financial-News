Corn futures advanced to the highest
price in more than two years on speculation that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture will lower its estimate of the
nation’s harvest.  Corn for December delivery gained as much as 1.5 percent to
$5.9075 a bushel, the highest price for the most-active contract
on the Chicago Board of Trade since Aug. 29, 2008. It traded at
$5.8725, up 0.9 percent at 11:47 a.m. London time.  Sixteen of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago to
Tokyo on Oct. 29 said corn will climb this week, and 15
respondents said soybeans will advance. The USDA will issue its
crop projections on Nov. 9.  “There’s uncertainty around the U.S. harvest,” Michael
Pitts, commodity sales director at the National Australia Bank
Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today.  The Dollar Index fell for a third day on speculation that
the Federal Reserve will take more credit-easing measures amid
signs of a weakening recovery in the world’s largest economy. A
declining dollar makes supplies from the U.S. cheaper for
holders of other currencies.  Soybeans for January delivery added as much as 0.8 percent
to $12.4625 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $12.405 a
bushel in Chicago. Wheat for December delivery increased by as
much as 1.5 percent to $7.28 a bushel before trading at $7.225.
Milling wheat futures on NYSE Liffe gained 0.2 percent to 225.5
euros ($314.66) a metric ton.  Rains are needed in some U.S. wheat-growing areas to
support crop development, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a report
dated Oct. 29.  “We’re looking at the forecast in the U.S. and what that
means for the crop,” Pitts said. Dry weather may cause “a more
adverse growing situation.” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
