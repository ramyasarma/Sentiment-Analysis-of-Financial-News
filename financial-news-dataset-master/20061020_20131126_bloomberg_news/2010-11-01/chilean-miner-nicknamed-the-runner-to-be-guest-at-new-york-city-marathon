Edison Pena, the Chilean miner
nicknamed “The Runner” during his 69 days underground, has
accepted an invitation to be a special guest at the New York
City Marathon on Nov 7.  Pena, 34, was among the 33 miners freed on Oct. 13 after
more than two months underground near Copiapo, Chile. Pena ran
in the tunnels nearly every day, sometimes up to six miles,
earning the nickname that drew the attention of race director
and  New York Road Runners  president  Mary Wittenberg .  “We watched with fascination and excitement when the
miners came up,” NYRR spokesman Richard Finn said in a
telephone interview. “Mary said, ‘That is what the essence of
the marathon is -- perseverance and determination. We should see
if we can reach out to him and extend an invite.’”  The NYRR contacted Pena through the Chilean Consulate on
Oct. 14 and Pena responded almost immediately. Pena is
interested in trying to run the main 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer)
race, although details of his participation are not yet
completed, Finn said.  This isn’t the first time the New York City Marathon has
hosted runners who have overcome physical and emotional
adversity. In 2005, more than 40 runners from the New Orleans
area participated in the race in the aftermath of Hurricane
Katrina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
