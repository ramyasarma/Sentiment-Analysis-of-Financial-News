Canadian officials responsible for
reviewing  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s hostile offer for  Potash Corp.  of
Saskatchewan Inc. are proposing the government accept the
transaction with certain conditions attached, the  National Post 
reported today, citing unidentified people within the ruling
Conservative Party.  Investment Canada, a division of the Department of
Industry, has proposed a government-appointed group be set up to
monitor whether the Australian company follows through on its
promises, including the relocation of BHP executives to
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Toronto-based newspaper said.  The officials’ review now goes to Canadian Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper , who must still rule on the proposed transaction,
the National Post reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
