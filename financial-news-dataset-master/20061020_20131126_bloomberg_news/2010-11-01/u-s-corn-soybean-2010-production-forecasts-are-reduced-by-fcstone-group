U.S. corn and soybean harvests will
be smaller than forecast a month ago, said FCStone Group Inc., a
commodity research and brokerage company.  Production of corn, the biggest U.S. crop, will total
12.523 billion bushels, down from 12.891 million forecast in
September, FCStone said today in a report to clients. Last
month,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture  predicted 12.664
billion, down from the record 2009 crop of 13.11 billion
bushels.  The soybean crop will reach 3.449 billion bushels, FCStone
said, down from its September forecast of 3.571 billion bushels.
The USDA last month predicted 3.408 billion bushels, up from
last year’s record of 3.359 billion bushels.  The department will release its fourth survey-based
estimate of U.S. crops on Nov. 9.  The U.S. is the biggest grower and exporter of corn and
soybeans. The 2009 corn harvest was valued at $48.6 billion,
followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, according to government
figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
