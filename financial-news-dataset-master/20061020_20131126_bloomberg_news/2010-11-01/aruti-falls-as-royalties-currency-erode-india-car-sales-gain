Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest carmaker, was the  biggest loser  on the
benchmark Sensitive Index after higher royalty payments to its
parent eroded gains from rising vehicle sales.  The carmaker’s shares fell 2.8 percent, the most since July
26, to 1,508.30 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trade in
Mumbai. The 30-company Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index
rose 1.6 percent.  Payments to  Suzuki Motor Corp.  for using technology more
than doubled from a year earlier in the fiscal second quarter
after the Indian government eased restrictions and the rupee
fell against the yen. New Delhi-based Maruti also paid more for
materials such as steel, eroding the benefit of a 27 percent
jump in vehicle sales.  “Raw-materials cost and the currency concerns continue to
impact margins,”  Sudhir Kukreja , a Mumbai-based analyst at
Dolat Capital Market Pvt., said in a note to clients today. “We
do not see a significant improvement in margins in the second
half.”  Maruti’s sales in October rose 39 percent to a record
118,908 vehicles, it said today. The automaker has posted 21
straight months of sales increases. Tata Motors Ltd. boosted
October sales 21 percent to 64,757 vehicles. Hyundai Motor Co.’s
sales in India climbed 23 percent to 34,725. Mahindra & Mahindra
Ltd. sales rose 34 percent to 34,495 vehicles.  Materials Costs  Maruti expects prices for raw materials to climb for the
rest of the fiscal year, Chief Executive Officer  Shinzo Nakanishi  said on an Oct. 30 conference call with investors,
after the company reported earnings. The carmaker plans to
increase localization to maintain margins, he said.  The automaker paid 4.72 billion rupees ($106 million), or
5.3 percent of net sales, in royalties to Hamamatsu, Japan-based
Suzuki. That was an increase of 2.21 billion rupees from a year
earlier, Nakanishi said. The rupee has fallen 9 percent against
the yen this year.  Net income rose to 5.98 billion rupees in the three months
ended Sept. 30 from 5.7 billion rupees a year earlier. Sales
gained 27 percent to 89.4 billion rupees.  Demand for cars in India has risen more than 30 percent
this year and may double to 3 million vehicles annually by 2015,
according to the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.   To contact the reporter on this story:
