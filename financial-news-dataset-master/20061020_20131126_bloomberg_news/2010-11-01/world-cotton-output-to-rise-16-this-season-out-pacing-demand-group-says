Global cotton production will rise 16
percent this year, out-pacing the gain in demand from textile
makers, according to the  International Cotton Advisory
Committee .  Output will total 25.3 million metric tons in the year that
ends July 31, up from 21.8 million in the previous season, the
Washington-based group said today in an e-mailed report. Last
month, the committee estimated production at 25.2 million.  Consumption will rise 1.6 percent to 25 million tons from
24.6 million a year earlier, ICAC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
