Wolverine Tube Inc. , which shut its
U.S. plumbing-tube business in 2007, sought bankruptcy
protection after failing to restructure the company.  Wolverine, based in Huntsville, Alabama, cited assets of
$115.6 million and liabilities of $237.5 million as of Oct. 3,
in a filing dated yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware. Four affiliates also sought protection.  The company in 2007 shut factories that employed 440 full-
time workers in Decatur, Alabama, and Booneville, Mississippi,
after demand for copper plumbing declined in the U.S. as
contractors switched to plastic.  “The debtors’ liquidity became increasingly constrained
due to the steep rise and significant volatility in the prices
of copper and other metals that are the core of the debtors’
business,”  Harold M. Karp ’s, Wolverine chief operating officer,
said in court papers.  Copper for delivery in December rose 6.6 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $3.7995 a pound at 8:53 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months climbed 1.8 percent to
$8,345 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  U.S. Bank National Association, indenture trustee for
Wolverine’s 15 percent secured notes due in 2012, is listed as
the largest unsecured creditor. The amount of the claim is
$139.2 million.  Wolverine  posted  losses in each of the past five years.  The case is In re Wolverine Tube Inc., 10-13522, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
