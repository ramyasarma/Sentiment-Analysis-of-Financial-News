The price of carbon dioxide must rise
to $175 a metric ton in order to halve global emissions by 2050,
the head of the International Energy Agency said.  The European emissions trading program, the world’s largest
carbon market, isn’t providing a reliable guide on the cost of
pollution to promote more investment in renewable energy and
other emission-cutting technologies,  Nobuo Tanaka , executive
director of the Paris-based agency, said in an interview in
Singapore today.  “It’s still too low,” Tanaka said. “The EU Emissions
Trading System is more of a trial period. The current level of
price is not necessarily a good reference for the usefulness of
the system.”  EU allowances for December 2010 delivery traded at 14.57
euros a metric ton as of 8:55 a.m. on London’s European Climate
Exchange, compared with 14.63 euros at the close of the previous
session.  “To achieve a 50 percent reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions by 2050, you need it to be $175 per ton,” Tanaka said.
More stringent emission reduction targets would lead to higher
prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
