Nawras , the Omani mobile phone
company controlled by  Qatar Telecom QSC,   rose  as much as 4.7
percent on its first trading day in Muscat.  The shares were trading 3.6 percent higher at 727 baisas at
10:04 a.m. in Muscat.  Nawras, which competes with  Oman Telecommunications Co., 
the largest phone operator in the Persian Gulf country, sold
shares at the low end of its book-building range at 702 baisas,
raising 182 million rials ($473 million). The company said in
September it was seeking to generate as much as $608 million by
selling a 40 percent stake.  The Omani company is joining a surge in emerging-market
share sales as stock markets rebound and companies restructure
debt. The Nawras initial public offering was the first in the
sultanate in two years and the Persian Gulf country’s first sale
by book-building. Oman’s benchmark stock index, the MSM 30, has
gained 8.2 percent in the second half of the year.  Third-quarter profit at Nawras jumped 62 percent to 12.5
million rials as the number of subscribers increased. Nawras,
which started operations in 2005, has a 45 percent share of the
sultanate’s mobile-phone market.  One Omani rial comprises 1,000 baisas and book-building is
a process in which potential investors say how many shares they
would buy and at what price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
