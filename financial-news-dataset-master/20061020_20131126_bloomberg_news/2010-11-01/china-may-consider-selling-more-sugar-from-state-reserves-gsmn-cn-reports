China may sell more sugar from
stockpiles to ensure supply, the industry website Gsmn.cn
reported today, without citing anyone. Additional sales would
depend on the market situation, the site said, without
elaborating.  The report also cited Liu Xiaonan, deputy head of the
economy and trade department at the National Development and
Reform Commission as saying a stable sugar market is beneficial
to every party in the business.   A big fluctuation in prices will hurt sugar farmers, the
site said, quoting Liu.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
