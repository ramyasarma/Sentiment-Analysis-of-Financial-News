Spansion Inc., the maker of flash-
memory chips that emerged from bankruptcy in May, is marketing
debt as the appeal of corporate bonds increases amid speculation
the Federal Reserve will resume asset purchases.  Spansion plans to sell $200 million of seven-year notes,
the Sunnyvale, California-based company said in an Oct. 28
statement distributed by PR Newswire. Proceeds will be used to
repay borrowings under a $450 million term loan, Spansion said.  The Fed will announce a second round of asset purchases, a
policy known as quantitative easing, after its Federal Open
Market Committee meets on Nov. 3, according to a survey of the
18 primary dealers that trade debt with the central bank. It
deployed $1.7 trillion to pull the economy out of the financial
crisis in the first quantitative easing, which ended in March.  Investors poured $345 million into high-yield, high-risk
debt mutual funds in the seven days ended Oct. 27, and $749
million into investment-grade bond funds, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch analyst  Oleg Melentyev  wrote in an Oct. 28 note
citing Lipper FMI data.  “If the Fed announces an aggressive program of purchasing
$1 trillion worth of Treasuries, we’ll get a pretty strong
reaction from all bonds,” said  Anthony Valeri , a market
strategist at LPL Financial Corp., which oversees about $277
billion of assets. “An aggressive reaction is ultimately going
to force investors into higher-yielding bonds such as
corporates.”  ‘Indiscriminate’ Purchases  The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of Treasuries was unchanged at 177 basis points on
Oct. 29, leaving it 4 basis points narrower for the week,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate
Master index. Yields fell 5 basis points to 3.611 percent, a 2
basis-point weekly decline.  Strong inflows into corporate bonds, equities and money
markets suggest that “investors appear to be indiscriminate in
what they are buying in anticipation of upcoming announcement of
the Fed’s new asset purchase program,” Melentyev wrote in the
report. That may be “exactly what the Fed intended to achieve
without even having to print a single dollar yet.”  Arrow Electronics Inc. , the distributor of semiconductors
that bought a unit from Richardson Electronics Ltd. this month,
helped lead $3.3 billion of corporate bond sales on Oct. 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies have issued $104.1 billion of bonds this month,
beating the $97.5 billion of issuance in October 2009, Bloomberg
data show.  Spansion’s debt may be priced as soon as Nov. 3, according
to a person familiar with the transaction, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Spreads on high-yield debt rose 5 basis points to 582 basis
points on Oct. 29 and were down 14 basis points for the week,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s High Yield Master
II Index. Yields fell 1 basis point to 7.62 percent, the lowest
since May 2007. High-yield debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The following is a description of at least $3.48 billion of
pending sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S.  Investment Grade  KOREA NATIONAL OIL CORP. hired Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas
