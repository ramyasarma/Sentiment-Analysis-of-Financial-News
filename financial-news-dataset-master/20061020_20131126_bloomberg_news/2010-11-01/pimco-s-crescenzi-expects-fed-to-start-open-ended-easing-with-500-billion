 The Federal Reserve will likely
begin a program of bond buying with about $500 billion in
purchases and leave it open-ended for “some chance of doing
more,” according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Tony
Crescenzi.  Asset prices have been bolstered by the expectation of so-
called quantitative easing and also prospects for the Republican
Party to gain control of the House of Representatives, he said
in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
