Evraz Group SA,  Russia’s second-
largest steelmaker, will resume crude steel production at its
unit in the Czech Republic after a four-month stoppage because
of a dispute over raw materials prices with  ArcelorMittal .  ArcelorMittal Ostrava, a unit of the Luxembourg-based steel
company, agreed to supply liquid pig iron to Evraz Vitkovice
Steel at an “acceptable” price, the Russian producer said
today in a statement. The Evraz unit halted crude steel output
from July 1, and made steel products from slabs supplied from
outside of the Czech Republic, including Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
