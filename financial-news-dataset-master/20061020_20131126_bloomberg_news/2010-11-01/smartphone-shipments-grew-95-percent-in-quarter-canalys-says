Third-quarter smartphone shipments
rose 95 percent from the same period last year to 80.9 million
units, according to analyst firm Canalys.  Nokia Oyj accounted 33 percent of shipments, followed by
 Apple Inc . at 17 percent and  Research In Motion Ltd.  at 15
percent, Canalys said in a  report  today.  Handsets using  Google Inc. ’s Android software increased
to more than 20 million units from 1.4 million, Canalys said.
Vendors using Android include  HTC Corp. , Samsung Electronics
Co., and Motorola Inc. Smartphone shipments in Brazil, Russia,
India, Indonesia and mainland China, where Nokia was the
leading vendor, gained 112 percent.  “Where smartphone growth in mature Western markets has
been driven by high-end products, in many emerging markets
where disposable income is more constrained, growth is being
driven by good-quality products that can attract mass-market
volumes,” analyst  Chris Jones  said in the report.  Apple became the leading smartphone vendor in the U.S.,
with its 26 percent share passing  RIM , the maker of the
BlackBerry, by two percentage points, according to Canalys.
Handsets running Android software accounted for 44 percent of
the U.S. market, Canalys said.  The overall mobile phone market grew 14.6 percent in the
third quarter to 340.5 million units, Framingham, Mass.-based
analysts IDC said in a  report  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
