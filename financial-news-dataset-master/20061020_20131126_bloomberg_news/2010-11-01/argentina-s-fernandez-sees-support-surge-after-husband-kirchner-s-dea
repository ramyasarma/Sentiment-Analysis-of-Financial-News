Support for Argentine President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  rose to 68.5 percent in a survey
taken the day after the death of her husband and predecessor
 Nestor Kirchner , according to pollster Ibarometro.  The number of people saying they had a positive image of
Fernandez, 57, rose 20 percentage points in the Oct. 28 survey
from a poll taken 10 days earlier, the Buenos Aires-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Kirchner , 60, died
of a heart attack on Oct. 27.  About 45 percent of those surveyed said they would back
Fernandez in next year’s presidential race, the poll said. Vice
President  Julio Cobos  had 11.8 percent support and Buenos Aires
Mayor  Mauricio Macri  was third with 10.1 percent.  “The death of Nestor Kirchner revitalized support for
Kirchnerism,” said Ibarometro’s President Doris Capurro. “Even
after the image of the current government was rising in recent
months, that growth process accelerated.”  The phone poll of 1,000 people in greater Buenos Aires had
a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
