Shanghai Pudong Road & Bridge
Construction Co. jumped by the maximum 10 percent limit on
speculation it will benefit from construction on Walt Disney
Co.’s theme park in the city.  Shanghai Pudong gained 10 percent to 16.36 yuan at 1:06
p.m. local time. Shanghai Construction Co. rose 8 percent to
14.68 yuan.  “The two stocks surged probably because of speculation
that construction on Shanghai Disney park will start soon and
the companies stand to win project contracts,” Luo Guo, an
analyst at Orient Securities Co., said by phone.  Pudong Road said one of its units won two contracts valued
at 1 billion yuan to build roads in Pudong district, according
to an exchange filing on Sept. 29. The Oriental Morning Post
reported on Sept. 30 the contracts are part of Shanghai Disney
park construction projects. Theme park construction starts this
month after the conclusion of the World Expo, the Shanghai
Securities News reported on Oct. 18,    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
