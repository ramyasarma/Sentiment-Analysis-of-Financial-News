An agreement to build an $8 billion
liquefied-natural-gas project in southeastern  Nigeria  is
expected to be signed in the first quarter of 2011, said Jackson
Gaius-Obaseki, chairman of Brass LNG Ltd.  “The take off and signing of the final investment decision
of the project will be done before the end of first quarter,”
Gaius-Obaseki said in an e-mailed statement yesterday from the
capital, Abuja.  The liquefied natural gas plant will be built at Brass in
Bayelsa state in the West African country’s oil-rich Niger River
delta. The state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. has a 49
percent stake in Brass LNG.  Total SA ,  Eni SpA  and  ConocoPhillips
Co.  each hold 17 percent.  Nigeria had proven natural gas reserves of 185 trillion
cubic feet as of January this year, the world’s eighth-largest,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
