Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state-
owned oil company known as Aramco, set initial interest margins
on $4 billion of revolving credits, according to three people
with knowledge of the situation.  Lenders will receive a margin of 13 basis points over
benchmark rates on a $1 billion one-year portion, and 18 basis
points on a $3 billion five-year part, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the transaction is private. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Money in a revolving
credit can be borrowed again once it’s been repaid.  The proceeds of the deal will be used to refinance credit
lines signed in 2006, the people said. That facility has $3
billion available until 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The financing was arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and Riyad Bank and included a
one-year portion that expired in 2007.  Mohammad Khazindar, a spokesman for Dharan-based Saudi
Aramco, wasn’t available to comment after business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
