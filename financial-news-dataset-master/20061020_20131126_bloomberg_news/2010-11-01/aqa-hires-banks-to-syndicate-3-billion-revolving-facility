Abu Dhabi National Energy
Co., the state-run utility known as Taqa, hired banks to start
syndicating a $3 billion revolving credit facility.  Taqa appointed Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., BNP
Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to arrange the
facility, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The facility is structured into multi-currency three- and
five-year revolving credit tranches,” it said. “The facility
will be used for general corporate purposes and will replace the
existing $3.15 billion revolving credit facility signed in
August 2008.”  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi will act as facility agent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
