Mexico’s peso fluctuated between
gains and losses as a smaller-than-forecast gain in U.S.
consumer spending offset speculation the Federal Reserve may buy
assets this week to spur economic growth.  The peso was little changed at 12.3415 per dollar at 9:34
a.m. New York time, from 12.3449 on Oct. 29. The currency has
gained 6 percent this year.  “The numbers today weren’t that great,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in
Stamford, Connecticut. “We think the Fed will take on an
incremental approach to QE2, which is positive for emerging-
market risk.”  Consumer spending in the U.S., Mexico’s largest trading
partner, rose 0.2 percent in September, the Commerce Department
said today. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a gain of 0.4 percent. The U.S. purchases about
80 percent of Mexico’s exports. The Fed meets Nov. 3 and may
purchase assets as it seeks to stimulate the economy.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.34 percent, according to Banco Santander SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
