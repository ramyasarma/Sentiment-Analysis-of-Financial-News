Harmony Gold Mining Ltd., Africa’s
third-largest producer of the metal, will boost output outside
of South Africa because of rising costs and labor-intensive
production in the country’s underground mines.  Harmony expects to produce 40 percent to 45 percent of its
gold in other nations in seven years, Chief Executive Officer
 Graham Briggs  said in an interview today. The company now has 92
percent of its resources in the country, he said.  Gold mining in Africa’s biggest economy “is underground,
labor intensive and uses lots of electricity, therein lies South
Africa’s problem,” Briggs said in Johannesburg, after closing
seven unprofitable shafts in the past year.  Mines are getting deeper and labor and power costs rising
faster than inflation, shrinking industry profits. South Africa
produced about 205,000 kilograms (452,000 pounds) of gold last
year, the lowest since 1907. Production peaked at more than 1
million kilograms in 1970, according to the Johannesburg-based
Chamber of Mines. Briggs said he doesn’t plan further closures.  “South African gold mines are mature and they’ve got to
become more efficient,” said David Davis, a Johannesburg-based
analyst at Credit Suisse Standard Securities. Output will
“continue to drop off, but at a slower rate,” he said.  Harmony’s output for the three months through September
fell 2.9 percent to 336,650 ounces, in line with the company’s
guidance.  Net income  rose to 102 million rand ($14.6 million)
from 13 million rand the previous quarter, it said. South
African gold analysts compare results quarter-on-quarter.  The company maintained its target of producing 2 million
ounces of gold by 2013, it said in a statement today.  Harmony  fell 1.20 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 79 rand by the
close at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  and  Gold
Fields Ltd.  are Africa’s largest gold producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
