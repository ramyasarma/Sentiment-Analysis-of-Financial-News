Royal Bank of Canada hired  Joseph Giordano , former co-head of structured retail sales at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as a director.  Giordano, 37, who started work last week in New York, is
responsible for selling structured notes and over-the-counter
derivatives to brokerages, investment advisers and private
banks, said Kait Conetta, a bank spokeswoman. He reports to
 Donald Dye , U.S. head of sales of structured products for
individual investors.  RBC’s U.S. issuance of structured notes rose to $1.4
billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Toronto-based bank sold $821 million in all of last year,
according to StructuredRetailProducts.com, a database.  In 2007, Giordano joined ABN Amro Holding NV, parts of
which were acquired by RBS that year, according to Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority  records . He helped develop the
bank’s businesses in U.S. structured notes and over-the-counter
equity options, Conetta said.  Dye joined RBC in April, according to Finra records. Since
then, RBC has hired  David Odenath , a former Deutsche Bank AG
salesman, and  Richard Morris , a former Nomura Holdings Inc. vice
president, for its U.S. structured-products group.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives,
such as options, are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
