Transport for London , which manages
public transport in the U.K. capital, has organized extra buses
and capacity on Thames River transport as London subway workers
plan to strike this week.  Capacity for about 10,000 extra river journeys and more
than 100 additional buses has been arranged, TfL said in an e-
mailed statement. The  Rail, Maritime and Transport Union  and
 Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association  will start the 24-hour
walkout tomorrow night, disrupting travel for the 3.5 million
people who use the subway each working day.  The strike is the third over planned job cuts, with a
fourth scheduled for Nov. 28. London Underground ran 40 percent
of its normal services during the last strike on Oct. 3, TfL
said today.  “Whether by bus, boat or bike when Londoners beat the
strike for a third time I hope the RMT and TSSA leaderships will
face facts and see that their action achieves nothing aside from
depriving their members of another day’s pay,” Mayor  Boris Johnson  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
