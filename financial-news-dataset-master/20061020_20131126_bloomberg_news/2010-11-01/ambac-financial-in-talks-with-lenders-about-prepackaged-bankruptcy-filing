Ambac Financial Group Inc. said it’s
pursuing with an ad hoc committee of senior debt holders a
restructuring of its outstanding debt through a prepackaged
bankruptcy proceeding. The information was disclosed in a
regulatory filing.  The company said if it’s unable to reach agreement on a
prepackaged bankruptcy “in the near term,” it plans to file
for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code
before the end of the year.  The company said its directors decided not to make a
regularly scheduled interest payment on Ambac’s 7.5 percent
debentures due May 1, 2023. That interest payment was scheduled
to be made today, the filing said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
