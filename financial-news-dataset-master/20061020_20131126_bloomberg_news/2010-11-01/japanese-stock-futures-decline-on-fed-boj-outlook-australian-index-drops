Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the
yen traded near a 15-year high before this week’s meetings by
the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan. Australia’s
benchmark index declined.  American depositary receipts of Advantest Corp., a Japanese
maker of memory-chip testers that gets almost 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, sank 1.1 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that
derives 35 percent of its sales in North America, retreated 1.1
percent. Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia’s largest investment
bank, retreated 1.2 percent today in Sydney.  The Bank of Japan said last week that policy makers
advanced their next session to Nov. 4-5, following a meeting by
the U.S. Federal Reserve on Nov. 2-3. Japanese markets are
closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  “Investors will refrain from active trading and there’ll
be selective buying” in Japan today, said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 9,120 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,160 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,130 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.2 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent.
The index was little changed yesterday in New York as growth in
Chinese and American manufacturing and speculation the Federal
Reserve will pump cash into the economy overshadowed a report
that JPMorgan Chase & Co. was being probed for mortgage deals.  U.S. Manufacturing  Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded more than forecast in
October as orders placed with factories and production both rose
to five-month highs. The Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index climbed to 56.9 last month, the highest since May,
from 54.4 in September, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
yesterday. Readings greater than 50 signal growth, and the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for
a decline to 54.0.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 8.2 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.9
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.2 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for December delivery climbed 1.9 percent to
$82.95 a barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement
since Oct. 18. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 1.1 percent.  Yen, Earnings  The yen traded at 80.61 against the dollar as of 7:45 a.m.
in Tokyo and appreciated to 80.22 yesterday, the most since 1995.
The yen is on course for its strongest annual average level
since currencies began trading freely in 1971, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s closing price.  About 150 companies of almost 1,000 in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index are scheduled to announce earnings this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far, about 15
companies have  exceeded profit estimates  for every 13 that have
fallen short, based on Bloomberg data compiled from about 380
companies that have reported quarterly results since Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter for this story:
