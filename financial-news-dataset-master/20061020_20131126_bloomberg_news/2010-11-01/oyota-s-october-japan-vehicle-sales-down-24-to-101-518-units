Plunging demand for  Toyota Motor
Corp.  and  Honda Motor Co.  cars led Japan’s October auto sales to
the lowest level for the month in 42 years after a government
subsidy program ended.  Registrations for October were the weakest since 1968 as
 sales  of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars, fell 27
percent from a year earlier to 193,258 vehicles, the  Japan
Automobile Dealers Association  said in a statement today.
Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, sold 101,518 units,
excluding Lexus-brand cars, a decline of 24 percent.  Industrywide car sales in Japan may fall 23 percent in the
six months through March 31 after a government subsidy for fuel-
efficient cars ended Sept. 8, according to the Japan Automobile
Dealers Association.  “The biggest declines are coming from automakers that
offered many models that were eligible for the government
subsidies,” said Michiro Saito, head of general affairs and
statistics at the association. Automakers also worry that
consumer fears over the nation’s economy may slow a recovery in
sales, he said.  Sales of Honda fell 30 percent to 30,422 vehicles last
month, while Nissan Motor Co. dropped 31 percent and Mazda Motor
Corp. plunged 52 percent, the association said.  Shares in Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, fell 1.9
percent to 2,805 yen in Tokyo trading as of 2:28 p.m., while
Honda dropped 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
