after the company lowered its second-half earnings forecast.  Hosiden Corp.  (6804 JO), a maker of electronic components,
lost 6.6 percent to 745 yen, the lowest since April 2003, after
slashing its full-year net income estimate by 60 percent to 2

quarter, hurt by declines in trading and brokerage commissions.  Noritz Corp.  (5943 JT), a maker of gas-fired baths and
water heaters, tumbled 14 percent to 1,271 yen, the largest
