The U.S. Treasury Department lowered
its estimate for government borrowing from October through
December, reflecting higher net issuances of state and local
government securities and cash balance adjustments.  Borrowing  will total a net $362 billion in the current
quarter, compared with an estimate three months ago of $380
billion, the department said in a statement today in Washington.
The Treasury also projected borrowing of $431 billion in the
three months to March 31.  The U.S. budget deficit reached $1.294 trillion in fiscal
year 2010, which ended Sept. 30, the second highest on record
and the second consecutive shortfall in excess of $1 trillion.  “The economy is healing and the expansion is expected to
strengthen,”  Alan Krueger , the Treasury’s chief economist, said
in a separate  statement  today. “However, risks remain.
Recoveries do not move in straight lines.”  In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the Treasury borrowed
$396 billion, compared with the previous estimate of $350
billion. The department said its forecasts assume a cash balance 
of $300 billion for Dec. 31 and $270 billion for the end of 
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
