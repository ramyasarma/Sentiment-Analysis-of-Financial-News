China’s inflation pressure should
peak around the fourth quarter and then subside, according to
China International Capital Corp.  Investors should hedge against inflationary periods by
buying stocks, gold and commodities, Hao Hong, Beijing-based
global equity strategist for CICC, wrote in a note to clients.
High inflation periods also tend to correspond with higher
median market returns, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
