The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
rise 10 percent by the end of the year if the Federal Reserve
announces plans to buy more bonds to inject money into the
economy, a tactic known as quantitative easing, said  Thomas J. Lee , chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “We’ve already seen some of it in pushing up asset prices
or risky assets,” Lee, Wall Street’s most optimistic
strategist, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom
Keene. “QE2 is going to ultimately be very effective. For now,
it’s very good for equity markets.”  The  S&P 500  has risen 14 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated during an Aug. 27 speech in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, that he may be willing to pump more money into the
economy. The Fed, which begins a two-day policy meeting
tomorrow, has been weighing more monetary injections as its
Beige Book business survey released Oct. 20 reported that the
economy grew at a “modest pace” in September.  JPMorgan’s Lee said that he favors economically sensitive
industries because businesses are gaining more confidence and
that should help lift corporate earnings.  “It’s sort of an upside-to-GDP bet,” he said. “We think
there’s at least a 9 to 10 percent upside until year end.”  The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in almost
four years, a sign the expansion is developing staying power. A
separate report last week showed business activity unexpectedly
accelerated in October.  Earnings Season  Earnings have beaten analysts’ per-share estimates at 259
of the 321 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results
since Oct. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg predict an average 28 percent gain in
third-quarter profit from a year earlier for all S&P 500
companies, and a 36 percent advance for 2010.  Lee increased his combined earnings-per-share forecast for
S&P 500 companies for 2010 and 2011 to $85.50 and $91,
respectively, according to a report dated Oct 28.  The JPMorgan strategist has the highest  S&P 500  estimate
for 2010 among 11 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg,
with a year-end forecast of 1,300. That’s 9.9 percent higher
than last week’s closing level, and compares with the average of
1,210.  To contact the reporters on this story:
