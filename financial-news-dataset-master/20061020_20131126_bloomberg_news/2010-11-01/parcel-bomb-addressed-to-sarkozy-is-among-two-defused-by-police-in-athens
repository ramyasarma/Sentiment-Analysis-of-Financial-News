Greek police defused two parcel bombs
found on two men arrested after a separate parcel bomb exploded
in an Athens suburb today, slightly injuring a woman.  The two bombs were addressed to the Belgian embassy and to
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based headquarters of the Greek
Police.  The two men, aged 22 and 24, were found in possession of
two handguns, wigs and a bulletproof vest, according to the
statement. The 22-year-old, who wasn’t named, has an outstanding
warrant against him for involvement in a group called Conspiracy
of the Nuclei of Fire, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
