The money market is pricing in too
high a chance that the European Central Bank will start raising
interest rates as early as next year, Barclays Plc said.  The ECB, which has kept its official rate at 1 percent
since May last year, will probably wait until 2012 before it
raises borrowing costs from the record low, according to
 Giuseppe Maraffino , a fixed-income strategist at Barclays in
London. The market is now betting for a 25 basis-point increase
in the official rate by December 2011, it said.  “We regard the hike expectations as too aggressive,”
wrote Maraffino in an e-mailed note received today. “If the Fed
should increase the quantitative easing and remain on hold next
year, all major central banks will remain on hold in 2011 with a
new tightening cycle likely to start in mid-2012.”  The implied rate on the Euribor futures contract due in
December 2011 was at 1.51 percent as of 12:49 p.m. in London.
Barclays said it sees 1.35 percent as a “fair value level” for
the three-month Euribor throughout 2011. That took into account
a 30 basis-point credit premium as reflected in the spread
between the forward rate agreement and the Euro Overnight Index
Average, or  EONIA , rate, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
