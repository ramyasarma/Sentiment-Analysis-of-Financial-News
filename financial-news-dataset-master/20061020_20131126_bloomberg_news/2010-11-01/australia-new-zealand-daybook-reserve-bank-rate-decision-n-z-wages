An overview of activity since markets
closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks slid, erasing an early rally, as financial
companies turned lower following a report that JPMorgan Chase &
Co. is being probed over its dealings in mortgage securities.
*JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by market value, lost as
much as 1.4 percent after the website ProPublica reported that
the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
it allowed a hedge fund to improperly select assets for a $1.1
billion deal backed by subprime mortgages. Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also declined.
*The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 1,178.7 at 3:19 p.m. in New
York, wiping out a rally of as much as 1.1 percent.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 49.61 points, or 0.5
percent, to 11,068.88 after surging as much as 126 points.  London: European stocks climbed after manufacturing in China and
the U.S. expanded more than forecast, boosting confidence in the
global economy before this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.2 percent to 266.4 at the
4:30 p.m. close of trading in London, as three stocks advanced
for every two that declined.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks dropped, driving the Topix index to its
longest losing streak since July, as companies reported lower
earnings or made forecasts that fell short of analysts’
estimates.
*Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, Panasonic
Corp., a consumer electronics maker, and All Nippon Airways Co.
all lost at least 3 percent after forecasts missed estimates.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.5 percent to 9,154.72.
*The Topix fell 0.9 percent to 803.30 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, its sixth consecutive retreat, the longest streak since
the eight days ended July 1. About twice as many shares declined
as advanced, and the gauge dropped the most among benchmark
Asia-Pacific indexes.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8
percent to 4,698.50 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar gained against the euro for the first time
in three days after a report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded
in October at the fastest pace in five months, boosting demand
for higher-yielding assets.
*The dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to $1.3885 per euro at 3:14
p.m. in New York, from $1.3947 on Oct. 29. It earlier declined
to $1.4011, the weakest level since Oct. 25.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries fell for the first time in three days after
a measure of factory output expanded in October faster than
forecast, adding to signs of faster economic growth and boosting
demand for higher-yielding assets.
*The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds earlier touched the lowest
level since Oct. 26 on a report that showed the Federal
Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation stagnated, capping the
smallest 12-month gain in nine years. Low inflation may
encourage the Fed to increase asset purchases when it holds a
policy meeting Nov. 2-3.
*Thirty-year Treasury yields rose four basis points to 4.02
percent.
*The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose three basis points
to 2.63 percent at 1:22 p.m. in New York.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper prices in New York rose the most in a week as
manufacturing accelerated in China, the world’s biggest consumer.
*Copper futures for delivery in December rose 5.15 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close $3.785 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in
New York, the biggest gain since Oct. 25.  GOLD  New York: Gold futures fell as a rebound by the dollar eroded
the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.
*Gold futures for December delivery dropped $2.20, or 0.2
percent, to $1,355.50 at 10:52 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  OIL  New York: Crude oil increased to a two-week high after Chinese
manufacturing expanded at the quickest pace in six months and on
expectations the Federal Reserve will announce measures this
week to stimulate the U.S. economy.
*Crude oil for December delivery rose $1.52 to $82.95 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement
since Oct. 18. Prices are up 7.7 percent from a year ago.  WHAT TO WATCH
