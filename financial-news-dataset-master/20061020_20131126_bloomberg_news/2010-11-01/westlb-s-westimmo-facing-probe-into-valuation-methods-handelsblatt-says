WestLB AG ’s Westdeutsche
Immobilienbank AG real-estate unit is facing an investigation by
German financial-market regulator BaFin into its internal
valuation methods,  Handelsblatt  said, citing unidentified people
in the industry.  A change in valuation methods would mean the company may
need to set aside more capital, the newspaper said. An
