JSE Ltd. , which runs South Africa’s
stock and bond exchanges, brought forward the start date of a
rand-volatility index by a week after its marketing team
erroneously said the gauge would begin trading today.  The company had planned to commence publishing prices for
the so-called RAIN index on Nov. 8,  Hannes Viljoen , manager of
the specialist securities team at the JSE, said in an interview
from his mobile phone. The index will track the rand’s movements
against the euro, dollar, pound, yen and Chinese yuan, the
Johannesburg-based company said in the earlier statement.  “It was unfortunately our marketing team that made a bit
of an error,” said Viljoen.  South Africa’s currency rallied almost 28 percent against
the dollar last year, following a 27 percent slump the previous
year. The country’s ruling  African National Congress  said
earlier this year that it was investigating the feasibility of a
tax on foreign purchases of South African stocks and bonds to
prevent swings in the rand’s value.  The weighting of each currency in the RAIN index will be
calculated using trade data from the  South African Revenue
Service , which is currently available with a two-month delay,
the JSE said in the earlier statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
