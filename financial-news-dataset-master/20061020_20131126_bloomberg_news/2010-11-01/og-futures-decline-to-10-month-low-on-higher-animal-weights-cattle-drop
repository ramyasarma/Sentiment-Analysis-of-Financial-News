Hog prices fell to a 10-month low as
demand for U.S. animals slackened and weights gaining,
increasing supplies of pork. Cattle futures dropped, extending
the longest slump since August.  On Oct. 29, the  price  of hogs for immediate delivery to
slaughterhouses fell 0.9 percent to 58.83 cents a pound, the
lowest level since Dec. 3, 2009.  Hog carcasses  averaged more
than 209 pounds (94.8 kilograms) on Oct. 28, the heaviest since
at least 2002, according U.S. Department of Agriculture  data .  “Supply-side fundamentals” are driving prices lower, said
 David Kruse , the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal, Iowa. “Fantastic gains” in carcass weights occurred
partly because of the better quality of livestock feed, compared
with last year, he said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.725 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 65.475 cents a pound at 10:39 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 65.275 cents,
the lowest level for a most-active contract since Dec. 31, 2009.  In October, futures tumbled 12 percent, the most in two
years. Before today, the price gained 0.9 percent in 2010.  Wholesale pork  has dropped 24 percent from this year’s high
on Aug. 24. Last week, the price fell 3.1 percent, the sixth
straight decline.  Earlier, hog futures climbed as much as 0.5 percent on
prospects for increased demand after prices slumped.  “There’s been very good pork demand at these lower
prices,” Kruse said. “Both the consumer and retailer are
getting a good deal.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.675 cent, or
0.7 percent, to 98.15 cents a pound. The price dropped for the
sixth straight session, the longest slump since late August.
Before today, the commodity jumped 15 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.625
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.10175 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
