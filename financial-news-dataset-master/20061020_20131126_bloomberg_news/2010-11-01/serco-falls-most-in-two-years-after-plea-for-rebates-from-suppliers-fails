Serco Group Plc , the operator of
London’s Docklands Light Railway, fell the most in two years
in London trading after a failed attempt to recoup money from
its suppliers.  The stock dropped  as much as  7.9 percent after the Hook,
England-based government services provider withdrew letters
requesting rebates from suppliers and apologized. Serco was
one of several contractors that the U.K. government asked to
lower prices.  “Where are they going to find the savings that they need
in order to maintain margins, if they are giving up in terms of
price to the government?” said  Mike Murphy  of Numis Securities
in a telephone interview. He cut his recommendation to
“reduce” from “hold” with a target price of 544 pence.  Serco fell as much as 48.5 pence to 565.5 pence, the
biggest decline since October 2008. The stock traded at 577.5
pence as of 10:22 a.m., valuing the company at 2.85 billion
pounds ($4.58 billion).  “We deeply regret this action and apologize
unreservedly” to suppliers “for the concern that this has
caused,” Serco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
