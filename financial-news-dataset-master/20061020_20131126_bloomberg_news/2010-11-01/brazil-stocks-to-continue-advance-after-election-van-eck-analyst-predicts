Brazilian stocks are likely to
continue their advance over the coming year as President-elect
 Dilma Rousseff  is expected to maintain the outgoing government’s
policies, said  Ed Kuczma , an emerging markets analyst at Van Eck
Associates in New York, which manages $21 billion. The benchmark
 Bovespa  index has risen 21 percent from a May 20 low.  On the outlook for stock gains:  “This election was somewhat of an overhang on the Bovespa.
Normally in election years you see a bit of uncertainty. Any
negative pressure with any kind of possibility that people
thought she could increase government pressure on large
corporations is all priced into the market.”  On the prospects for the new government:  “I’m not that concerned in the long term. I would look for
Dilma to continue the same positive momentum for the economy.
There’s a big need to increase spending on the social side and
reduce poverty. As long as Brazil continues on the fundamentals
Lula enacted, Brazil should be fine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
