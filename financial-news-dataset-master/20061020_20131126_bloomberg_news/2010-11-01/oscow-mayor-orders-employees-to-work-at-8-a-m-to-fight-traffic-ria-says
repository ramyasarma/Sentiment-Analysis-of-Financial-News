Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, two
weeks into the job, ordered city hall employees to start work an
hour earlier as part of a drive to alleviate traffic congestion
in the Russian capital, RIA Novosti reported.  Workers are now required to be at work by 8 a.m., the
state-run news service reported today, citing unidentified
people familiar with the intitiative.  President Dmitry Medvedev in September fired former Mayor
Yury Luzhkov after 18 years in power and named Sobyanin, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff at the time, to the
position on Oct. 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
