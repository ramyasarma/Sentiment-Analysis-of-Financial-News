Japan’s 10-year government  bonds  fell
for a second day amid speculation investors reduced holdings to
prepare for tomorrow’s auction of the securities.  Ten-year yields neared a one-month high before the Ministry
of Finance sells 2.2 trillion yen ($27 billion) of the bonds.
Debt futures dropped as the yen retreated from near a record
high against the dollar before the Bank of Japan and Federal
Reserve hold policy meetings this week.  “Yields may be pushed up to 0.95 percent, which should
secure demand for the auction,” said  Satoshi Yamada , chief
quantitative analyst at Tokyo-based Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc. “It’s hard for investors to make big moves now, as bonds
may be sold after markets digest the outcome of the Fed
meeting.”  The yield on the 0.8 percent bond due September 2020 rose
2.5 basis points to 0.945 percent as of 3:05 p.m. in Tokyo at
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price declined 0.223 yen to 98.690 yen.  Ten-year yields reached 0.97 percent on Oct. 28, the
highest since Sept. 28. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery fell 0.12 to
143.08 as of the close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The prior 10-year sale on Oct. 7 drew bids worth 2.85 times
the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.16 at the September sale.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds in case prices
decline before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  The yen was at 80.43 per dollar from 80.40 in New York last
week. It earlier touched 80.22 per dollar, the most since April
1995, when it climbed to a post-World War II high of 79.75.  U.S. Data  Losses in bonds were limited before a report today that
economists said will show U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower
pace, adding to expectations the Fed will take action to shore
up the economy. The Japanese central bank is set to gather on
Nov. 4-5 after the Fed’s meeting on Nov. 2-3.  “The BOJ wants to show it’s doing its part to support the
economy and stave off political pressure,” said  Takashi Nishimura , an analyst in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest lender by assets.
“The U.S. economic recovery will probably take time, providing
a floor for bonds.”  The BOJ plans to discuss purchases of exchange-traded funds
and real-estate investment trusts at its meeting. The bank left
its key interest rate and credit programs unchanged on Oct. 28.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index in the
U.S. dropped to 54 in October from 54.4 in September, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before today’s data. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
