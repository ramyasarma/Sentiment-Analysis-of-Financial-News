Global cotton production  will rise 16
percent this year, outpacing the gain in demand from textile
makers, as high prices encourage farmers to plant more crops,
the  International Cotton Advisory Committee  said.  Output will total 25.3 million metric tons in the year that
ends July 31, up from 21.8 million the previous season, the
Washington-based group said today in an e-mailed report. Demand
will rise 1.6 percent to 25 million tons from 24.6 million, ICAC
said.  Cotton futures are up 71 percent this year on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York as mills rebuild shrinking supplies, India
limits exports, and adverse weather threatens crops. A cold
front in China, the world’s largest user of the fiber, and hail
storms in Texas recently damaged fields.  "Plantings in large Southern Hemisphere producing countries
such as Australia, Brazil and Argentina are projected
significantly up from last season, driven by the current high
cotton prices, and should result in considerable gains in
production," Armelle Gruere, a statistician at ICAC said in an
e-mail before the report.  Stockpiles will rise 4.5 percent to 9.3 million tons this
year, from 8.9 million a year earlier, the group said. Cotton
 inventories  held in warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S.
totaled 12,286 bales as of Oct. 29, down 99 percent since June
1. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Price Forecast  The  Cotlook A Index  of prices in Asian ports will climb to
an average of 92 cents a pound, 19 percent more than a year
earlier, ICAC said. The index, which reflects the average of the
five cheapest prices offered at Far East ports, rose 1.5 cents
to $1.43 a pound today, the highest since reaching a record
$1.47 last week.  Today, cotton prices in New York rose by the 4-cent
exchange limit on mounting concern that global demand is
exceeding supply. Cotton for December delivery rose 3.2 percent
to settle at $1.2926 a pound on ICE.  The fiber reached a record of $1.305 on Oct. 26 and gained
23 percent in October, the biggest monthly gain since June 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
