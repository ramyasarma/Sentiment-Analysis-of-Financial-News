Vietnam’s food and beverage stocks
will probably outperform the benchmark index as consumers
maintain essential spending even while inflation accelerates,
the country’s biggest brokerage said.  “People can cut back on luxury goods, but they still need
to eat and drink,” said  Do Hiep Hoa , head of equity research at
Hanoi-based Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co., recommending
 Vietnam Dairy Products Joint-Stock Co.  among so-called defensive
shares. “I do not expect the food sector to gain, but it should
fall less than the overall market if inflation remains high.”  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s  VN Index  has slumped
8.9 percent this year as high interest rates, currency
devaluations and tighter capital adequacy ratios for banks
discourage investment. The index entered a so-called bear market
on Aug. 24 after tumbling more than 20 percent from a high in
May. This year, it has  beaten  only Japan among Asia’s 15 biggest
equity markets.  Thang Long cut its index target by 8.9 percent to 469.50 in
a report dated Oct. 10. The gauge has dropped 1.8 percent since
then, leaving it 62 percent below the all-time high of 1,170.67
on March 12, 2007. The measure fell 0.4 percent to 450.98 at
10:23 a.m. local time.  Vietnam Dairy Products , or Vinamilk, the country’s third-
most-valuable company and biggest dairy producer, has dropped 18
percent from its record high on Feb. 27, 2007, less than one-
third of the benchmark index’s tumble from its 2007 record.
 Masan Group Corp. , whose food products include instant noodles
and sauces, has surged 65 percent this year.  Kinh Do Corp. , a
producer of baked goods and candy, has gained 11 percent in
2010.  Devaluation, Inflation  Vietnam’s  inflation  accelerated to a 19-month high, a sign
that an August currency devaluation may be hurting efforts to
restrain prices. Consumer prices rose 9.66 percent in October
from the same month a year earlier, according to figures
released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi on Oct. 23.  The central bank has devalued its currency three times in
the past year as policy makers sought to cut the trade deficit.
The dong’s weakness may fan inflation, which has held above 8
percent for nine consecutive months, exceeding the government’s
target for this year.  “Inflation hasn’t shown signs of easing for the rest of
the year, and foreign demand hasn’t fully recovered,” Hoa said.
Still, the food and beverage “sector relies on rising domestic
demand, which in turn depends on a fast-growing population and
per capita GDP,” he said.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said on Oct. 20 that the
government will target economic growth of 7 percent to 7.5
percent next year and the economy may expand 6.7 percent this
year. Gross domestic product per capita would reach $3,000 to
$3,200 by 2020, he said in August. The current figure is about
$1,160, Dung said on Oct. 20.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
