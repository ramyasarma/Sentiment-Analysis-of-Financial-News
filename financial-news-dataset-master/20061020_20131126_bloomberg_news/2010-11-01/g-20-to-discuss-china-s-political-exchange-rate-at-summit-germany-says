Germany supports urging China to let
the yuan appreciate gradually, the German government said in a
position paper for next week’s meeting of Group of 20 leaders.  Participants are likely to discuss “politically directed
exchange rates,” including the Chinese currency, at the Nov.
11-12 summit in Seoul, South Korea, according to the document
shown to reporters today. China should let the yuan appreciate
“in stages,” the paper said.  China is being urged by major trading partners including
the U.S. and Europe to let its currency appreciate faster. China
has curbed the yuan’s rise to about 2 percent against the dollar
since a June pledge to introduce more flexibility, arguing that
sudden appreciation could cause social and economic disruption.  Proposals to give the International Monetary Fund a bigger
role in providing a “financial safety net” for future crises
are also on the agenda, the German paper said. Germany is “very
skeptical” about giving the IMF greater powers, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
