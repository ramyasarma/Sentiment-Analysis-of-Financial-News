China will control the addition of
coal-fired power generation capacity in eastern regions during
2011-2015 to curb coal consumption, China Securities Journal
reported today, citing Jiang Bing, the director of the
development and planning department of the National Energy
Administration.  The country plans to have non-fossil fuels account for 11
percent of its total energy consumption by 2015, the Beijing-
based newspaper owned by Xinhua News Agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
