Sugar rose in New York and London on
speculation India, the world’s second-largest producer, may
limit exports.  India intends to allow more exports of the sweetener after
the Diwali festival on Nov. 5, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said
on Oct. 27. Estimates for exports range from 1.5 million metric
tons to 3 million tons, according to  Naim Beydoun , a broker at
Rolle, Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar Brokers.  “Inventory levels are so low that they can’t afford to
export,” said  Carsten Fritsch , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Commerzbank AG. “If they decide to do so, they risk becoming a
net importer again next year if the 2011 harvest disappoints.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.3 cent, or 1
percent, to 29.42 cents a pound at 9:09 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. In London, white, or refined, sugar for March
delivery rose $3.20, or 0.4 percent, to $727.20 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Robusta coffee for January delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$1,975 a ton on Liffe. Arabica beans for December delivery
declined 1.9 percent to $1.996 a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for December delivery dropped 9 pounds, or 0.5
percent, to 1,847 pounds ($2,965) a ton in London. The chocolate
ingredient for December delivery fell $19, or 0.7 percent, to
$2,778 a ton in New York.  Ivory Coast, the world’s largest grower of cocoa, yesterday
held its first presidential election in a decade.  Preliminary results are expected within three days.
Economic development has been stunted since a 2002 military
uprising led to civil conflict and division between a rebel-held
north and a government-controlled south. The country relies on
cocoa for more than a quarter of its export earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
