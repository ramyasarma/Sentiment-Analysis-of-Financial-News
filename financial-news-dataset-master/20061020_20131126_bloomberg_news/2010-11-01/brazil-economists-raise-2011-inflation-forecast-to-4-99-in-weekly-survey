Brazilian economists raised their
 inflation  and  debt  forecasts for this year in a sign they think
the government may fail to curb  spending  as domestic demand
fuels economic growth, a weekly central bank survey showed.  Brazil’s consumer prices may rise 5.31 percent this year,
up from a week-earlier forecast of 5.29 percent, the survey
published today said. Brazil’s net debt as a percentage of gross
domestic product will rise to 40.89 percent, up from 40.87
percent a week earlier, the survey showed. Economists also
raised their net debt-to-GDP forecast to 39.64 percent next
year, up from 39.57 percent a week earlier.  Economists forecast Brazil’s central bank will raise the
benchmark overnight rate, known as the Selic, by one percentage
point next year to keep inflation in check, the weekly survey
showed.  “Under a scenario of continuing fiscal expansion, the
central bank answer may be an elevation of the Selic rate in the
first quarter of 2011, which would increase the potential for
appreciation of the real,”  Cristiano Oliveira , chief economist
at Banco Safra de Investimentos, said in a note to clients
today. “The success or failure of Copom’s intention to keep the
Selic rate at 10.75 percent for a relatively long period will
essentially depend on coordination between monetary, fiscal and
exchange rate policies.”  Interest-Rate Futures  Traders are betting Brazil’s President-elect  Dilma Rousseff 
may fail to contain government spending in Latin America’s
biggest economy, fueling inflation, yields on Brazil’s most
traded interest-rate future contracts showed last week.  The yield on the interest-rate future contract due in Jan.
2012 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.42
percent at 9:21 a.m. New York time. The real fell 1 percent to
1.6967 per dollar.  Economists estimate that the impact on inflation from a cut
in spending of one percent of GDP could be canceled out by a one
percentage point reduction in the benchmark rate, a separate 
central bank survey taken Oct. 15-29 and released  today  showed. 
A cut in spending of one percent of GDP would also mean a 
reduction of inflation by 31.5 basis points in the four 
quarters ahead, according to the median of 64 analysts surveyed 
by the central bank.  Rousseff, who takes office Jan. 1, said last week her goal
is to cut net public debt to 38 percent from 41 percent of GDP
by the end of her four-year term. In an interview with Veja
magazine in June, Rousseff said she would aim to cut net debt to
28 percent of  GDP  in a bid to give the central bank room to
lower the  benchmark interest rate .  Slower Growth  Brazilian economists held their outlook for economic growth
at 7.6 percent this year, slowing to 4.5 percent next year, the
survey showed. Policy makers will keep the benchmark rate at
10.75 percent in their Dec. 7-8 meeting, according to the
survey.  Economists cut their 12-month inflation forecast to 5.14
percent from 5.16 percent a week earlier, the survey showed. In
a separate survey taken Sept. 21-27, the central bank said 54
economists see the country’s equilibrium real interest rate, or
the rate needed to ensure inflation is in check when the country
is growing at its potential, at 6.75 percent.  Analysts expect the central bank to raise the benchmark
rate to 11.25 percent in April as domestic demand stokes
inflation. Policy makers held the Selic rate at 10.75 percent at
their last two meetings after raising it 200 basis points this
year from a record low 8.75 percent.  Factory Output  Brazil’s  industrial output  unexpectedly fell in September
as the real strengthened close to a two-year high, reducing
pressure on the central bank to raise rates next year.  Industrial production contracted 0.2 percent in September
from August, the fifth monthly decline since April, the national
statistics agency said Nov. 4. Output rose 6.3 percent from a
year ago, the slowest annual pace this year and below analysts’
median forecast for a 7.1 percent increase.  Brazil’s  unemployment rate  fell to a record low 6.2 percent
in September, from 6.7 in August. The figure was the lowest
since the government began publishing the data in March 2002.  According to a Sept. 30 quarterly inflation report, policy
makers forecast inflation will slow to 4.6 percent next year
should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 10.75 percent.  The bank  targets  inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  The real has appreciated about 36 percent since the start
of 2009, the second-best performer among the 25 emerging markets
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind the South African rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
