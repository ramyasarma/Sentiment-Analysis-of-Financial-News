Government policy focused on green
energy is hurting the competitiveness of fossil fuels such as
oil and natural gas, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said in a
speech in Singapore today.  The focus “unlevels the playing field,” Naimi said in a
speech at the Singapore Energy Summit today. Fossil fuels will
have to “bridge the gap,” until green energy is affordable, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
