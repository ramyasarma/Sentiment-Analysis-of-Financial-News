Fourteen al-Qaeda militants
surrendered to local authorities in Yemen’s southern province of
Abyan, the Defense Ministry said.  Ahmed al-Misari, Abyan’s governor, said the surrender
followed efforts by local authorities, dignitaries, clerics and
the parents of the militants, according to a statement today on
the ministry’s website. The ministry didn’t say whether those
who surrendered were linked to the attempts last week to send
two parcel bombs from Yemen to the U.S. via air-cargo services.  Al-Qaeda’s organization in Yemen, which tried to blow up a
U.S. airliner in December, has stepped up violence since June,
killing dozens of security personnel in a series of raids in
southern cities. The impoverished Arabian Peninsula nation is
also battling separatists in the north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
