Brazil may raise the so-called IOF
tax on foreigners’  stock  purchases to contain the appreciation
of the real before President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  takes office
Jan. 1, Raymond James & Associates Inc. said.  The levy for equities has been at 2 percent since being
imposed in October last year, while the IOF for fixed-income was
last month increased twice, to 6 percent. The government may
also impose an income tax on foreigners’ investments in
government bonds,  Mauricio Rosal , an economist at Raymond James
in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients today.  “We believe the top-priority concerns shared with the
existing economic team may lead to relevant policy being
introduced before her swearing into office,” Rosal wrote.
“Fears of such actions may well trigger further near-term
capital inflow.”  Rousseff said after yesterday’s vote that her main goal is
to eradicate poverty in Brazil while maintaining a lid on
spending. She also cited a “currency war” that has seen the
real strengthen 36 percent against the dollar since the end of
2008, “signaling that she is prepared to tackle it,” according
to Raymond James.  To contact the reporter on this story:
