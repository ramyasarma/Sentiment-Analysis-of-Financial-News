Chinese central bank adviser Zhou
Qiren said the nation should further improve its exchange-rate
mechanism to reduce the need for making foreign-exchange
purchases that inject yuan into the market, which fuels
liquidity, inflation and market speculation in real estate and
in commodities such as cotton, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today.  The key is to change the mechanism rather than simply
allowing the yuan to rise or fall, the newspaper cited Zhou as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
