The cost of protecting  BHP Billiton
Ltd.  bonds from default surged the most in more than two months
amid reports the world’s biggest mining company may raise its
$40 billion offer for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Credit-default  swaps  on BHP, the world’s biggest mining
company, rose 6 basis points to 91 basis points by 2:57 p.m. in
London, prices from data provider CMA show. That’s the biggest
gain since Aug. 18 and the highest level since Oct. 8.  BHP may raise its offer for Potash Corp. as much as 27
percent to $165-a-share should the deal win Canadian government
approval this week, UBS AG said today in a note. The mining
company may increase the bid 10 percent, the Sunday Times
reported yesterday, citing people it didn’t identify.  Potash Corp., the biggest maker of the crop nutrient,
rejected BHP’s $130-a-share offer in August and said last week
it held talks with 15 potential bidders. Canada’s government is
set to rule on the deal by Nov. 3 and may block the transaction
if it’s not seen to provide “net benefits” to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
