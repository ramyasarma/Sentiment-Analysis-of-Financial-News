African Capital Alliance, a Lagos-
based private equity firm, is in talks to acquire a stake in
 Union Bank Nigeria Plc , a person familiar with the talks said.  Union Bank, which is also based in Lagos, has shortlisted
two potential investors, neither of which is a bank, Francis
Barde, the company’s spokesman said on Oct. 29, without
identifying the companies. The person familiar with the talks
declined to be identified because the negotiations are
confidential. African Alliance officials declined to answer
questions when their office in Lagos was visited by Bloomberg
today.  Some Nigerian banks are in talks with potential investors,
Muhammed Abdullahi, a spokesman for the Abuja-based central
bank, said yesterday, declining to be more specific.  A debt crisis in Nigeria’s banking industry last year
forced the central bank to rescue 10 of the country’s lenders by
injecting 620 billion naira ($4.1 billion) of capital into them.
Eight of the lenders’ chief executive officers were fired and
the central bank called for interested parties to bid for stakes
in the banks.  Barde didn’t answer calls made to his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
