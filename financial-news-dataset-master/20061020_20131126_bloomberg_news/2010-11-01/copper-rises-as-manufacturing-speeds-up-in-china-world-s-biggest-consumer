Copper prices in New York rose the
most in a week as manufacturing accelerated in China, the
world’s biggest consumer.  A purchasing managers’ index released by China’s logistics
federation climbed to 54.7 in October from 53.8 the prior month,
topping forecasts. Readings greater than 50 signal growth. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed
to the highest level since October 2008, led by gains in cotton,
energy and copper.  “The market is getting a boost from that manufacturing
data out of China,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at
LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “The Chinese economy
continues to gather steam, and that’s positive for copper.”  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 5.15 cents, or
1.4 percent, to close $3.785 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex
in New York, the biggest gain since Oct. 25.  Better-than-expected manufacturing data in the U.S. also
helped support prices, Zeman said. Copper may reach $3.90 this
week, he said.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to
56.9 last month, the highest since May, from 54.4, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a decline to 54.  Investors are more  bullish  on copper than at any time since
January, government data show.  In the week ended Oct. 26, speculative long positions, or
bets or rising prices, outnumbered short positions by 26,463
contracts, the most since Jan. 29, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said on Oct. 29.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added $100, or 1.2 percent, to $8,300 a metric ton ($3.76
a pound). Lead, zinc, nickel and aluminum also gained on the
LME, while tin was unchanged.  To contact the reporters on this story:
