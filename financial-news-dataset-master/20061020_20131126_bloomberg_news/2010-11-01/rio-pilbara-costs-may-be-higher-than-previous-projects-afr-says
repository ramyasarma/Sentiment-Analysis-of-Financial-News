Rio Tinto Group’s cost to expand its
iron ore operations in Western Australia’s Pilbara region may be
about 30 percent higher than previous growth projects, the
Australian Financial Review said, citing comments from Sam
Walsh, chief executive officer of Rio’s iron ore business. Walsh
told analysts last week to expect capital costs of about $130 a
new ton of production in the Pilbara, the Review said. The
estimate means the cost of increasing capacity by 100 million
tons a year will be about $13 billion, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
