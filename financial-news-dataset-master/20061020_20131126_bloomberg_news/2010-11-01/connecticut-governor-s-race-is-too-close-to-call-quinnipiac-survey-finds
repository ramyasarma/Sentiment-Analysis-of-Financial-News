The  Connecticut  governor’s race is
too close to call, with Republican  Tom Foley  carrying a three-
percentage-point lead over Democrat  Dan Malloy , a Quinnipiac
University  poll  reported today.  Foley, a former U.S. ambassador to Ireland, received
support from 48 percent of likely voters, the poll said. Malloy,
the former mayor of Stamford, was backed by 45 percent. About 6
percent of likely voters said they were undecided. An Oct. 26
Quinnipiac poll showed Malloy leading Foley 48 percent to 43
percent.  “The late deciders are breaking for Tom Foley,” said
 Douglas Schwartz , poll director, in a statement. “There has
been a big shift among independents in the final week of the
campaign toward the Republican.”  The winner of tomorrow’s vote will succeed Republican  Jodi Rell , who didn’t seek re-election.  Connecticut’s net tax-supported debt of $4,859 per person
is the highest in the U.S., according to Moody’s Investors
Service. In 2009, the state led the nation in personal income,
at $55,063 per capita, according to Commerce Department data.  The Oct. 25-31 survey of 930 likely voters had a margin of
error of 3.5 percentage points, the statement said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
