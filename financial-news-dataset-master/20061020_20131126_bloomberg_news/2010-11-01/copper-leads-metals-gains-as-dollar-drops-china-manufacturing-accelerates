Copper advanced from London to
Shanghai as investors sought alternatives to a declining dollar
and as manufacturing accelerated in China, the world’s largest
user of industrial metals. Zinc, aluminum and lead climbed.  Three-month-delivery copper rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$8,290 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at
$8,288 at 10:13 a.m. Singapore time. The metal used in
construction and household appliances capped a fourth monthly
increase in October as the  dollar  slumped 1.9 percent against a
six-currency basket last month.  “All eyes are on the Federal Reserve meeting this week,
what steps they’re going to take in terms of quantitative
easing, and how the dollar reacts to what they’re going to
say,” Zhang Hai, analyst at China Aviation Futures Co., said
from Shanghai.  Copper on the Comex in New York gained as much as 1.2
percent to $3.7775 a pound, before trading at $3.766. February-
delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose as much as
1.8 percent to 63,560 yuan ($9,524) a ton, climbing for the
first time in four days.  The dollar dropped for a third day against the euro on
expectations the Federal Reserve will increase debt purchases to
sustain the recovery in the world’s largest economy.  “China’s PMI is also giving a bullish boost to metals
today,” said Zhang, referring to the Purchasing Managers’
Index.  China’s manufacturing rose to 54.7 in October, expanding at
the fastest pace in six months, the logistics federation said
today. The reading compared with 53.8 for both the previous
month and the median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Aluminum in London gained 0.8 percent to $2,363 a ton, zinc
increased 1.7 percent to $2,463 a ton and lead rose 0.9 percent
to $2,470 a ton. Nickel climbed 0.9 percent to $23,200 a ton,
while tin advanced 0.7 percent to $25,775 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
