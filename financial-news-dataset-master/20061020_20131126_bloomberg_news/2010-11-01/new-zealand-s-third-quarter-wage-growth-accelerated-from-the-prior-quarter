New Zealand wage growth accelerated
as demand for exports buoyed economic growth and increased the
amount companies needed to pay to attract and retain workers.  Wages for non-governmental workers, excluding overtime,
advanced 0.6 percent in the third quarter from the second
quarter, according to Statistics New Zealand’s labor cost index
released in Wellington today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
