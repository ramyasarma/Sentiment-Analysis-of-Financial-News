South Africa’s rand strengthened
against the dollar after the fastest expansion in China’s
manufacturing in six months bolstered confidence in the global
economy, increasing the appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 6.9584 per
dollar and traded at 6.9600 by 10:08 a.m. in Johannesburg, from
a previous close of 6.9990.  China’s purchasing managers’ index released by the
logistics federation rose to 54.7 from 53.8 in September, with
input prices climbing the most in six months. A second PMI, from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, jumped to 54.8 from
52.9, adding to signs of sustained momentum in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy.  “A lot of the positive move in the market is being driven
by Chinese PMI which came in better than expected,”  Quinten Bertenshaw , a Johannesburg-based currency analyst at Tradition
Analytics, said in a telephone interview. “That makes for a
positive day for emerging markets, which is being reflected in
the rand.”  Emerging-market stocks and currencies advanced after the
faster-than-estimated expansion in China’s manufacturing boosted
demand for higher-yielding assets from developing nations.
Prices of commodities including copper, gold, platinum and oil
also rose.  Government bonds in South Africa rose for a third day, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 adding 7
cents to 126.19 rand. The yield on the bond fell two basis
points to 7.04 percent.  South Africa’s  PMI  data for October is scheduled for
release at 11 a.m. local time today by Johannesburg-based
brokerage Kagiso Securities Ltd., which sponsors the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
