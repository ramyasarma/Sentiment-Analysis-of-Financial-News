Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak
has cancelled a meeting today with his Australian counterpart
Julia Gillard due to illness, the Southeast Asian premier’s
press secretary Tengku Sariffuddin Tengku Ahmad said in a
telephone interview.
He has been advised to rest and avoid all public functions after
showing early signs of chicken pox, state news service Bernama
reported yesterday, citing the premier’s media adviser Jalaludin
Bahaudin.  Gillard will instead meet Malaysia’s Deputy Prime Minister
Muhyiddin Yassin in Putrajaya today, Tengku Sariffuddin said.
U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is due to arrive in
Malaysia tonight for meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
