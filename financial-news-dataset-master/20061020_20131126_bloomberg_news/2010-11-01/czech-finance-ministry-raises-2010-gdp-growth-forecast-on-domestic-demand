The Czech  economy  will expand more
than initially expected in 2010 as household demand picks up
while planned government  spending cuts  will curb growth next
year, the Finance Ministry said.  The ministry in Prague revised its outlook for 2010 gross
domestic product growth to 2.2 percent from 1.6 percent, it said
in a quarterly update of economic forecasts posted today on its
 website .  The economy should expand 2 percent next year, less
than the previously forecast 2.3 percent. The fiscal gap will be
smaller in 2010 than the government’s target, the ministry said.  The  economy , where exports including cars made by Skoda
Auto AS account for about 70 percent of output, is recovering
from the worst recession since the end of communism in 1989. GDP
expanded an annual 2.4 percent in the three months through June,
the fastest pace in eight quarters.  “The Czech economic recovery continues favorably with a
further acceleration in output growth,” the ministry said.
“Renewed export dynamics has positive effects on domestic
demand, household consumption is developing favorably.”  The 2010 budget is benefiting from lower government
borrowing costs, the finance ministry said, estimating the full-
year fiscal gap at 5.1 percent of gross domestic product, less
than the government’s target of 5.3 percent.  Public Spending  The administration of Prime Minister Petr Necas, in office
since July, plans to halve the public finance shortfall to less
than the  European Union’s  limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013. The
Cabinet aims to narrow the public gap, which is the fiscal
benchmark for assessing an EU member’s readiness to join the
euro area, to 4.6 percent of GDP next year.  The government’s plan to narrow the deficit has helped the
koruna strengthen 5.5 percent against the euro since the May
28-29 general elections, making it the world’s best-performing
currency in the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Czech Republic’s A debt rating may be raised if the
government follows through on pledges to reduce spending,
including an overhaul of the pension system, Standard & Poor’s
said on Aug. 10. S&P revised its outlook on the rating to
“positive” from “stable.”  The ministry also forecast average inflation of 1.5 percent
for 2010, and saw consumer-price growth at 2.2 percent next
year. The new set of forecasts sees an average koruna exchange
rate at 25.3 to the euro this year and at 24.2 in 2011.  The economy may grow an annual 3.2 percent and 3.8 percent
in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The statistics office will
release a flash estimate of third-quarter GDP on Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
