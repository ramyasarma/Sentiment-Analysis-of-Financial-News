Irish bonds declined, driving the
extra yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
German debt to a record, on heightened concern the nation will
struggle to fund its budget deficit.  The government’s 2011 budget must pass a number of tests,
and “probably the most important” is to convince investors to
lend to Ireland, Defense Minister  Tony Killeen  said yesterday on
Dublin-based broadcaster RTE. The International Monetary Fund
may be running Ireland by February if the budget, due Dec. 7,
“fails to convince the financial markets,”  Colm McCarthy , an
economics professor at University College Dublin, said in an
interview with the Sunday Independent yesterday. Greek and
Portuguese bonds also fell, while German government bonds rose.  “The biggest worry about Ireland is the growth picture,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Investors are fretting that the
actual growth implication of these fiscal consolidation measures
may make it more difficult for budget-deficit targets to be
achieved.”  The yield on Ireland’s 10-year bond climbed 23 basis points
to 7.24 percent as of 4:43 p.m. in London. The 5 percent
security due October 2020 fell 1.41, or 14.1 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,389) face amount, to 84.465.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Irish debt instead
of German bunds, the euro region’s benchmark securities, widened
by 26 basis points to 466 basis points, according to Bloomberg
generic data. That’s the most since Bloomberg began collecting
the data in 1991.  Wider Spreads  The yield on the German 10-year bund fell four basis points
to 2.48 percent. The two-year note yield dropped one basis point
to 0.98 percent.  The yield spread on other so-called peripheral bonds
widened relative to bunds. The Greek 10-year bond yield climbed
seven basis points to 10.79 percent, the highest level since
Sept. 27, based on closing prices. The Greek-German spread rose
10 basis points to 814 basis points, the most since Sept. 30.  Greece will stick to its agreement with the European Union
and the IMF in May to reduce its fiscal deficit in return for a
110 billion-euro emergency loan package, government spokesman
 George Petalotis  said today.  “The government’s position is the strict adherence to, and
implementation of, the objectives of the program to lead the
country out of the crisis,” Petalotis said, according to an e-
mailed transcript of a press briefing in Athens.  Debt Restructuring  His comments follow remarks by Deputy Prime Minister
 Theodoros Pangalos  in an interview with To Vima newspaper that
Greece may consider restructuring its debt at some point.  Portuguese 10-year bonds reversed earlier gains, pushing
the yield up 18 basis points to 6.19 percent, the highest since
Oct. 13. The Portuguese-German spread widened 20 basis points to
363 basis points, the most since Oct. 15.  Portuguese securities advanced earlier today after the
governing party and main opposition reached an agreement on the
nation’s budget at the end of last week. Parliament will start
discussing the 2011 budget on Nov. 2 and an initial vote is
scheduled for the next day, with the Social Democratic party
abstaining to let the measure pass.  “Even though the agreement between the Portuguese
government and the opposition has been achieved, there are
worries that the macro-economic backdrop means that they still
may not achieve the budget reduction target for next year,”
Stamenkovic said. “That’s keeping investors pretty nervous.”  The cost of insuring against losses on euro-region
government bonds surged, according to data provider CMA.  Credit-Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on Ireland jumped 22 basis points to
495.5, surpassing the Sept. 27 record closing price. Greek swaps
climbed 37 basis points to 831.5, the highest level since Sept.
20, while Portugal’s added 11 basis points to 390. Spanish swaps
rose 9.5 basis points to 224 and swaps for Italy increased 2.5
basis points to 174, CMA prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  Finland plans to sell as much as 1.5 billion euros of bonds
maturing in 2020 and 2025 tomorrow, while France will auction a
total of 8 billion euros of Treasury bills due in 13, 20, 24 and
50 weeks.  German bonds have returned 7.9 percent this year, compared
with an 8.8 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 15 percent,
while Irish debt has lost 6.2 percent. Portuguese bonds have
lost 5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
