Takefuji Corp. , the Japanese consumer
lender that filed for bankruptcy protection in September,
attracted 20 overseas and local firms for possible investment, a
court-appointed administrator said.  Japanese and overseas private-equity funds, as well as some
financial groups that own consumer lenders, have shown interest
in investing in Takefuji, Eiichi Obata, a lawyer appointed to
oversee the company’s rehabilitation, said at a press conference
on Oct. 31.  The administrators hired  Shinsei Bank Ltd.  to select a
financial sponsor to rehabilitate the consumer lender, Obata
said. They will start the bidding process in the middle of
November and decide the investor by March, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
