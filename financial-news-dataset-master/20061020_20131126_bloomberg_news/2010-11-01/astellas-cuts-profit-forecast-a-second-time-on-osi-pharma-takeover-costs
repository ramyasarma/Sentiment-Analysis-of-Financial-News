Astellas Pharma Inc.  cut its full-
year profit forecast a second time, saying earnings will be 13
percent less than predicted because of costs relating to its $4
billion takeover of OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Net income  will fall to 33 percent from a year earlier to
82 billion yen ($1 billion) in the 12 months ending March 31,
Tokyo-based Astellas said today. That’s less than the 94 billion
yen forecast in August and the 107 billion yen projected in May.
Analysts predict profit of 86.9 billion yen, according to the
average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Masafumi Nogimori  completed the
purchase of OSI in June, gaining the Tarceva cancer treatment to
cope with falling revenue as its top-selling Prograf and Flomax
drugs face competition from cheaper generic copies.      
Astellas  rose 0.1 percent to 2,998 yen at the 3 p.m. close on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, before earnings were reported.  The company raised its full-year sales projection by 3.1
percent from its previous forecast to 942 billion yen. The
Japanese drugmaker posted revenue of 975 billion yen in the year
ended March 2009.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
operating expenses, will reach 124 billion yen this year, 8.1
percent less than previously predicted.  Analysts  project  sales of 938 billion yen, based on the
average of 16 estimates, and operating profit of 126 billion yen
this fiscal year.  Astellas said that in the current year it will amortize
19.8 billion yen in goodwill relating to the OSI purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
