Kabel Deutschland Holding AG  is
seeking to amend its loans and raise additional financing to
extend the maturity of its senior loans, pay dividends and
redeem junior debt.  Germany’s largest cable-television operator is asking
lenders for a two-year extension to March 2014 on its 325
million-euro ($453 million)  revolving credit  and its 1.425
billion-euro term loan A, it said in a  statement . It has net
debt of 2.9 billion euros, which matures between 2012 and 2014,
according to the Unterfoehring, Germany-based company’s website.  Kabel Deutschland is also seeking permission to raise as
much as 350 million euros from additional secured debt to repay
existing borrowing and for general corporate purposes, according
to the statement. The  cable operator  also wants to be able to
pay dividends with a debt-to-earnings ratio of as much as 3.5,
up from the current limit of 3, it said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc is coordinating the loan amendment,
while BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc joined as bookrunners.  To contact the reporters on this story:
