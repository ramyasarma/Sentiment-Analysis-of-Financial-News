Nigeria’s central bank postponed its
next Monetary Policy Committee meeting, previously scheduled for
tomorrow, by three weeks.  The meeting will now take place on Nov. 22, the Abuja-based
 Central Bank of Nigeria  said today on its website. Muhammed
Abdullahi, a spokesman for the bank, declined to give reasons
for the change when contacted on his mobile phone.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer and most populous
country, unexpectedly raised the benchmark interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 percent at the last
meeting on Sept. 21. It was the first increase since June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
