Bobby Valentine  is the leading
candidate to replace  Ken Macha  as the Milwaukee Brewers’
manager, Sports Illustrated reported on its website.  Valentine, the former New York Mets and Texas Rangers
manager who is currently an analyst for Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN,
is Milwaukee’s likely first choice for the job and expected to
be offered a contract, the  website said , citing two unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  Chicago White Sox coach  Joey Cora  would be the probable
first fall-back candidate, followed by former Arizona
Diamondbacks manager  Bob Melvin  and Los Angeles Angels coach  Ron Roenicke , SI.com said.  Valentine has a 1,117-1,072 record managing the Rangers
from 1985 to 1992 and the Mets from 1997 to 2002. The Mets, who
are looking for their own manager after firing  Jerry Manuel 
following the season, won the National League pennant in 2000
under Valentine before losing to the New York Yankees in the
World Series.  The Brewers announced on Oct. 4 that Macha wouldn’t return
following the team’s 77-85 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
