Total SA, Europe’s third-biggest oil
company, plans to invest about $7 billion on research and
development in 2010-2015 to improve efficiency and reduce
emissions, its head of exploration and production said.  Total is researching renewable energy, solar power, biomass
fuels and the capture and storage of carbon, Yves-Louis
Darricarrere said at a conference in Abu Dhabi today. The
company plans by 2014 to cut its emissions from the flaring of
natural gas by half compared with emissions levels in 2005, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
