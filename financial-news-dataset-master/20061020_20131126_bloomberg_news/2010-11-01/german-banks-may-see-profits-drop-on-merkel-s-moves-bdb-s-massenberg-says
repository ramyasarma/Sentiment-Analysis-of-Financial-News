German banks may face lower profits
under levies imposed and planned by Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government, according to Hans-Joachim Massenberg, deputy
managing director of the country’s BDB banking association.  “Our calculations show that  German banks  will have to give
up 40 percent of pretax profit” to cover the cost of the
measures, Massenberg said in an interview in Berlin today. That
doesn’t include increased capital requirements announced by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in September, he said.  The BDB, which represents lenders including  Deutsche Bank
AG  and  Commerzbank AG , said last week that government burdens
imposed on German banks since the financial crisis have
“reached their limit” and threaten their competitiveness.  A banking levy, new rules on securing deposits and German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s plan to tax financial
activities are the measures taken into account in the BDB’s
estimated impact on earnings, Massenberg said.  The Berlin-based BDB also opposes a government proposal
that would require banks to report all consumer complaints about
financial advice to Germany’s BaFin bank regulator, Massenberg
told reporters. The group prefers leaving it up to banks to
report complaints, he said.  “Individually, each regulation makes sense in response to
the financial crisis,” Massenberg said in the interview. “But
we believe we should look at the total impact” as part of a
“regular dialogue” with Merkel’s government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
