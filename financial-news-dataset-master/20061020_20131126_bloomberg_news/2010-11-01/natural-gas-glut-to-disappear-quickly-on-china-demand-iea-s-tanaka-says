A glut of natural gas exists because
of the global recession and “will quickly disappear” on demand
from China, International Energy Agency Executive Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said.  “If we assume the current level of demand, it may take 10
years,” Tanaka said at the Singapore Energy Summit today.
“Demand in China is uncertain, so it could be much shorter.”  Surplus production capacity last year was estimated at 200
billion cubic meters, according to the IEA’s Medium-Term Oil &
Gas Markets 2010 report published in June.  The global recession, and especially the sovereign debt
crisis in Europe led to a “decoupling” between prices for oil
and natural gas, Qatar Energy Minister  Abdullah bin Hamad al- Attiyah  said at the conference.  Natural gas prices have fallen 25 percent this year while
crude oil futures have risen 3.1 percent over the same period on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
