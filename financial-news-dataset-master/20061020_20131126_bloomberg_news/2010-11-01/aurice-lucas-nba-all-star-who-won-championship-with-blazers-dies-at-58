Maurice Lucas , a four-time National
Basketball Association All-Star power forward who helped lead
the Portland Trail Blazers to a championship, died yesterday of
bladder cancer. He was 58.  Lucas, who was a Trail Blazers assistant coach from 2005 to
2010, died after a long battle with the disease, the team said
in a news release.  Nicknamed “The Enforcer,” Lucas averaged 14.6 points and
9.1 rebounds during his career, playing two seasons in the
American Basketball Association before joining the Trail Blazers
in 1976.  His 20.2 points per contest led the team in scoring during
the 1976-77 season as Portland won its only NBA championship.  “Portland and the NBA lost one of their greats today,”
Trail Blazers owner  Paul Allen  said in a statement. “Maurice
Lucas was an amazing man and I count myself lucky to have known
him.”  Maurice D. Lucas was born Feb. 18, 1952, in Pittsburgh. He
played college basketball at Marquette University, leading the
team to an appearance in the national championship game in 1974
against North Carolina State.  In two ABA seasons with St. Louis and Kentucky, he averaged
15.2 points and 10.8 rebounds, and after a three-season stay in
Portland also played for the New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks,
Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers and Seattle SuperSonics.  Lucas returned to Portland for the 1987-88 campaign before
having his jersey,  No. 20, retired .  Lucas had been an assistant with the Trail Blazers for six
seasons.  “We have lost a champion of a man,” said Trail Blazers
coach  Nate McMillan . “Maurice was a great man and a great
friend. He battled his illness like the warrior he was on the
basketball court.”  Lucas is survived by his wife, Pamela; sons David and
Maurice II; and daughter Kristin, according to AP. Funeral
arrangements have yet to be determined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
