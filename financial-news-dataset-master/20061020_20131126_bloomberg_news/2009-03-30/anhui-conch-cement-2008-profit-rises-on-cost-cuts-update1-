             Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) , China’s
biggest maker of the building material, said 2008 profit rose
4.5 percent as the company cut production costs by adopting
energy-efficient technologies.  
 Net income  climbed to 2.6 billion  yuan  ($380 million), or
1.55 yuan a share, from 2.5 billion yuan, or 1.7 yuan, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Shanghai stock
exchange. Sales increased 29 percent to 24.2 billion yuan. The
numbers were prepared under mainland Chinese accounting
standards.  
 Demand for cement fell in 2008 as construction of
commercial buildings and residential units eased in an economic
slowdown. China’s government has pledged 4 trillion yuan
of stimulus spending, which will benefit Anhui Conch and rival
 China National Building Material Co. (3323)  as the country builds more
infrastructure.  
 “The implementation of the stimulus policies will help
drive demand growth for cement,” the statement said. “ China’s
economy  will likely achieve about 8 percent growth in 2009.”  
 Still, competition in the cement industry will intensify in
2009 as new production capacities start, and prices may fall,
the company said.  
 Anhui Conch intends to streamline its coal purchasing
system to buy better-quality fuel and achieve lower production
costs, it said.  
 Anhui Conch rose 25 percent this year in Hong Kong trading,
beating the 6.5 percent decline on the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .
GF Fund Management Co. this month said it favors cement and
construction stocks as they stand to benefit the most from the
stimulus plan.
