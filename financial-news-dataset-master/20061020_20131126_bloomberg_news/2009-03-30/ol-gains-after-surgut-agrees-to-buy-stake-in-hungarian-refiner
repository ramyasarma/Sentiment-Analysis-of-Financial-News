             Mol Nyrt. surged the most in three
months in Budapest after OAO Surgutneftegaz agreed to buy a
stake in  Hungary ’s biggest oil refiner.  
 Mol soared as much as 1,490 forint, or 15 percent, to
11,430 forint, posting the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 17.
The stock closed at 10,120 forint.  
 Surgut, the Russian  oil company  with the most cash
reserves, agreed to buy a 21.2 percent stake in Mol for 1.4
billion euros ($1.9 billion) from  Austria ’s  OMV AG (OMV)  to expand
processing capacity.  
 OMV, central  Europe ’s biggest oil company, abandoned a 2.8
trillion-forint ($12 billion) hostile takeover bid for Mol in
August 2008 after the European Union expressed competition
concerns over the proposed acquisition.  
 Mol gained on speculation the company is “back in play
now,” Bram Buring, a Prague-based analyst at Wood & Co. wrote
in a note to clients, adding that Surgut’s stake purchase may be
“a potential catalyst for consolidation in the sector.”  
 Mol said it plans to pursue a stand-alone strategy and
considers Surgut as a “financial investor.” The two companies
didn’t hold consultations before OMV decided to sell its stake,
according to an e-mailed statement.  
 Tisza Chemical Group Nyrt., the chemicals maker controlled
by Mol, jumped 65 forint, or 3.2 percent, to 2,125 in Budapest.  
 Hungary’s benchmark  BUX Index (BUX)  of 14 companies declined 2.6
percent today.
