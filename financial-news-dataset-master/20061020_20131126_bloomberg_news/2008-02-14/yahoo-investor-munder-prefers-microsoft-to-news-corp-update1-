             Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  shareholder Ken Smith,
director of technology investment at Munder Capital Management,
said he prefers  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 's offer to acquire Yahoo to an
alliance with  News Corp. (NWSA)   
 Yahoo may seek to avoid a Microsoft takeover by combining
Internet operations with News Corp. The two companies are
discussing a transaction, according to a person with knowledge of
the talks. That won't help Yahoo because News Corp. is having
trouble finding ways to make money on the Internet, Munder said.  
 ``I don't see what it brings to the table for Yahoo or News
Corp.,'' Smith said. ``News Corp. has a lot of traffic but
they're having trouble monetizing it.''  
 Munder, based in Birmingham, Michigan, manages $33 billion,
including 1.9 million Yahoo shares and 1.3 million Microsoft
shares as of Dec. 31, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Smith said he still would like Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft to raise its $31 a share bid to $35.  
 Yahoo, in Sunnyvale, California,  rose  10 cents to $29.98 at
4 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Microsoft
 fell  46 cents to $28.50. News Corp.'s Class A shares declined 7
cents to $19.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.
