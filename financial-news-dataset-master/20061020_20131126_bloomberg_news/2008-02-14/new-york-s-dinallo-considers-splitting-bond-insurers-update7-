             Bond insurers may be split into two
businesses in what would be the biggest overhaul of the industry
since it was created almost four decades ago.  
 New York Insurance Department Superintendent Eric Dinallo
said such a separation is one of the proposals regulators have
been discussing with bond insurers, including  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and  Ambac
Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ)   
 ``One would have the municipal bond policies and any other
healthy parts of the business,'' Dinallo said in prepared
testimony for a hearing today of the House Financial Services
subcommittee on  capital markets  in  Washington . ``The other would
have the structured finance and problem parts of the business.''  
 New York Governor  Eliot Spitzer  told the committee that the
step, while ``not optimal,'' may be necessary if the companies
can't raise the capital needed to stave off credit-rating
downgrades. The world's largest bond insurers may lose the AAA
ratings they use to guarantee $2.4 trillion of municipal and
mortgage-backed debt, casting doubt on the rankings of thousands
of schools, hospitals and local governments around the country.  
 Dinallo said his main goal is to protect the municipal
borrowers and debt holders. Executives of Armonk, New York-based
MBIA and Ambac are also scheduled to appear before the committee
and will say they can survive the slump in mortgage securities.  
 Recapitalization  
 The best option is to recapitalize the bond insurers and
stabilize the companies without dividing them, Spitzer told
reporters after his testimony. ``That could happen within a
couple of days,'' he said.  
 Dinallo last month organized banks to begin plans for a
rescue of the insurers and said he may consider tightening
restrictions on what bond insurers can guarantee.  
 Splitting the companies in two was proposed by billionaire
investor  Warren Buffett , who this week said he offered to take
over $800 billion of the municipal debt guaranteed by MBIA, Ambac
and FGIC Corp., the fourth-largest bond insurer. The plan would
leave behind the guarantees on mortgage-backed securities and
other corporate debt responsible for the companies' losses.  
 Spitzer told the committee that such a ``good bank, bad bank
structure,'' may be necessary if other rescue plans fail. Federal
regulation may also be needed, he said.  
 ``I am not opposed to federal regulation but how and when it
is done needs to be thought through,'' Spitzer said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television.  
 Insurers are supervised by states rather than the federal
government, with New York often taking a lead role. New York
regulates bond insurers under Article 69 of the state insurance
law, Spitzer said in his testimony, calling the statute ``the
standard for state insurance departments around the country.''  
 Policy Options  
 U.S. lawmakers at the hearing today criticized the practices
of the bond-insurance industry, saying they turned good debt bad
and need to be put under the supervision of a federal regulator.  
 The expansion by the industry beyond their traditional
municipal-bond businesses to guaranteeing debt linked to riskier
subprime mortgages and home-equity loans, ``has had disastrous
consequences,''  Spencer Bachus  of  Alabama , the top Republican on
the House Financial Services Committee, said.  
 Representative Paul Kanjorski of  Pennsylvania , who is
presiding over the hearing today, proposed enacting a law that
would allow the  Federal Home Loan Banks  ``to enhance municipal
bonds with letters of credit like  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac 
already do.''  
 Spitzer said that would be a ``very worthy idea.''  
 ``Other policy options include imposing new requirements for
 credit rating agencies  and addressing the differences between
ratings on structured finance products, corporate debt and
municipal bonds,'' Kanjorski said.  
 Approaching Buffett  
 Dinallo said he approached Buffett to value the municipal
bond portfolio of the three largest insurers.  
 ``There may be other investors who would be interested in
investing in the municipal side of the business,'' Dinallo said
in his testimony.  
 MBIA and New York-based Ambac, the two largest bond insurers
are reeling from their expansion beyond guaranteeing municipal
debt to collateralized debt obligations, which repackage assets
such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new securities with
varying risk. As the value of some CDOs plummets, ratings
companies are pressing insurers to add more capital.  
 MBIA  rose  98 cents to $12.62 today in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading. Ambac  climbed  $1.16 to $10.53. MBIA
and Ambac tumbled more than 80 percent in the past year as they
posted record  losses  of more than $5 billion and concern grew the
companies may not get enough capital to sustain their ratings.  
 No Bailout Needed  
 MBIA Chief Financial Officer Charles Chaplin dismissed
suggestions that the industry needs a rescue or stronger federal
oversight, according to his prepared remarks.  
 ``A bailout of highly credit-worthy companies who, at most,
are at risk of losing the very highest ratings available, is
misplaced,'' Chaplin said.  
 MBIA has raised $2.6 billion through investors and an
additional $500 million in capital has been generated as existing
policies have run off and through gains in the investment
portfolio, Chaplin said in an interview ahead of his scheduled
testimony before the hearing.  
 ``That gives us a cushion of more than a $1 billion to each
of the rating agency's stated requirements,'' Chaplin said. ``No
reasonable person would say MBIA won't be able to pay claims.''  
 Chaplin and Ambac Chief Executive Officer Michael Callen are
trying to fend off critics who say the companies may be headed
for bankruptcy. One of the most vocal skeptics, hedge fund
manager  William Ackman , will also deliver remarks today.  
 Municipal Focus  
 Spitzer told the committee that the economy may face a
``financial tsunami'' as a result of potential downgrades to bond
insurers and a tightening of credit markets that resulted from
bad loans to homebuyers.  
 Federal regulators blocked earlier efforts to tighten rules,
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed ``the
problem to grow and the bubble to inflate,'' Spitzer said.  
 Spitzer and Dinallo both said their focus is on the
municipal market rather than banks and financial institutions
that sought insurance on structured-finance securities.  
 ``We cannot allow the millions of individual Americans who
invested in what was a low-risk investment lose money because of
subprime excesses,'' Dinallo said. ``Nor should subprime problems
cause taxpayers to unnecessarily pay more to borrow for essential
capital projects.''  
 Demand for AAA rated securities still exceeds the supply and
New York has invited new companies to provide bond insurance,
Dinallo said.  
 ``It has become clear that the loss of the AAA rating
essentially cripples the company's ability to do business as a
going concern,'' Dinallo's testimony said.  
 FGIC Corp., the bond insurer owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) 
and PMI Group Inc., lost its Aaa insurance rating at Moody's
Investors Service today after failing to raise enough capital to
compensate for losses on subprime-mortgage guarantees.
