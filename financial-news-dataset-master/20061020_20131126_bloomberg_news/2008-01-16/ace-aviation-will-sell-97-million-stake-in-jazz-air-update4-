             ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. agreed to
sell a C$96.85 million ($94.7 million) stake in Jazz Air Income
Fund, which controls regional carrier Jazz Air, trimming its
share by more than half, to 9.5 percent.  
 Funds controlled by West Face Capital Inc. and Sunrise
Partners LP will buy a total of 13 million units, Montreal-based
ACE Aviation, the parent company of  Air Canada (AC/A) , said today in a
statement.  
 ACE Aviation is paring its investments as Chief Executive
Officer Robert Milton moves to wind up the holding company and
return money to shareholders.  
 ACE retained a 23 percent interest in aircraft maintenance
unit ACTS after selling a 70 percent stake to Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. in June. ACE owns 75 percent of Air Canada and
20.1 percent of the Aeroplan Income Fund, which runs Air
Canada's frequent-flyer loyalty program.  
 ACE fell C$1.54, or 5.9 percent, to C$24.40 at 4:10 p.m. in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading. Jazz gained 23 cents, or 3.2
percent, to C$7.44.  
 Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Jazz Air operates regional
flights in  Canada  and the U.S. in partnership with Air Canada.
