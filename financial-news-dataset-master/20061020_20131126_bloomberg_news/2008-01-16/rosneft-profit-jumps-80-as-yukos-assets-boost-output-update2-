             OAO Rosneft, Russia's largest oil
producer, said third-quarter profit jumped 80 percent as it pumped
more crude and refined more gasoline with assets bought from
bankrupt OAO Yukos Oil Co.  
 Net income rose to $1.89 billion from $1.05 billion in the
same period in 2006, Moscow-based Rosneft said in an e-mailed
statement today. That beat the median estimate of $1.87 billion
from a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  
 ``I'm pleasantly surprised,'' Xavier Grunauer, a London-based
analyst for Nomura International Plc, said by phone. ``I see a
solid set of numbers. Nothing stands out as outrageous.''  
 Sales increased 54 percent to $13.7 billion, driven by higher
production and refining volumes.  
 Rosneft spent about $27 billion buying Yukos assets at
auctions to become the country's biggest oil producer and refiner.
Yukos, once Russia's largest company by market value, was
dismantled after being slapped with more than $30 billion in tax
claims. State-run Rosneft acquired Yukos's three biggest
production units after former Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison
for tax evasion and fraud.  
 Rosneft traded 2.4 percent lower at 216.31 rubles at 1:20
p.m. in Moscow. The shares have declined 6.3 percent since the
beginning of the year.  
 ``It's down with oil prices,'' Grunauer said. Crude oil for
February delivery declined as much as $1.09 a barrel, or 1.2
percent, to $90.81 in after-hours electronic trading on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange.  
 Rising Output  
 Rosneft increased third-quarter crude oil output 29 percent
to 2.09 million barrels a day from 1.62 million barrels with
production at its biggest unit, OAO Yuganskneftegaz, rising 6
percent to 1.22 million barrels a day. Refining more than doubled
to 11.9 million metric tons in the quarter from 5.70 million tons.  
 ``In terms of volume, we're seeing post-Yukos Rosneft for the
first time,'' said Artyom Konchin, an oil and gas analyst at
UniCredit Aton in Moscow, before the results were released. ``I
think we'll see further improvements in quality as they start to
use the multitude of new options they've acquired.''  
 Total costs increased 48 percent to $10.6 billion in the
third quarter. Production and operating expenses more than doubled
to $1.33 billion and export duty payments rose 19 percent to $3.51
billion.  
 Increased Profitability  
 ``Profitability per barrel increased despite taxation and
inflation cost increases exceeding oil price appreciation,'' Chief
Executive Officer Sergei Bogdanchikov said in the statement.  
 It was a ``good quarter,'' Rosneft Vice President Peter O'Brien said today by phone from Moscow before the results were
released. ``We are continuing to improve efficiency.''  
 Net debt was less than $28 billion at the end of the third
quarter, and the company is ``continuing to prepare a range of
options for refinancing,'' O'Brien said. He declined to be more
specific.  
 Rosneft began to consolidate Yukos's  Tomskneft (TOMG)  and
Samaraneftegaz production units in mid-May, meaning their output
only partially affected the second quarter.  
 In December, Rosneft agreed to sell half of Tomskneft to OAO
Gazprom Neft, the crude oil arm of state-run natural-gas company
OAO Gazprom.
