             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the San Diego-based
defense contractor specializing in computer services, said it
won a contract with a potential value of $454 million to supply
information technology to the U.S. Army.  
 The General Services Administration award covers computer
networks that link 10,500 Army National Guard and Army Reserve
units at 4,000 sites worldwide, and a remote training system,
the company said in a statement. The contract has a base period
of four months, with four one-year extension options and a final
option for eight months.  
 SAIC yesterday said first-quarter earnings rose 25 percent
to $100 million, or 24 cents a share, from $80 million, or 19
cents, a year earlier. New contracts awards from the U.S.
military and government drove  sales  up 18 percent to $2.37
billion.  
 SAIC rose 7.1 percent, the biggest gain since Oct. 13,
2006, to $21.25 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 5.6 percent this year.
