             Sulzer AG (SUN) , the world's second-biggest
maker of pumps, plans to buy  Bekaert NV (BEKB) 's diamond-like carbon
coating business to add coatings used in semiconductor
manufacturing and race-car engine parts.  
 The diamond-like carbon coating business generated 2007
sales of more than 15 million euros ($23 million), Winterthur,
Switzerland-based Sulzer said today in a statement. Growth
opportunities and technological synergies have proven to be
limited over time within the group, Bekaert said in a separate
statement.  
 The acquisition would expand Sulzer's Metco division, which
makes thin-film coatings to reduce friction or make metal parts
more resistant to corrosion and wear. The transaction would add
six plants in  Belgium , France, Germany and the U.S., with 164
employees, and is subject to regulatory approval, Sulzer said.
