             Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and Boeing Co.,
each aiming to win a $40 billion U.S. order to replace the
Humvee transports used in  Iraq , are counting on intelligence
gained in assembling complex weapons systems to land the
contract.  
 This time, brains may not be enough. Their separate bids
for the  Joint Light Tactical Vehicle , or JLTV, are pitted
against five teams with more combat-vehicle manufacturing
muscle. Among the competitors:  General Dynamics Corp. (GD) , which
assembles Stryker transports, is paired with Humvee builder  AM
General , and  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , producer of the Bradley Fighting
Vehicle, joined with  Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
Warrenville, Illinois-based maker of blast-resistant trucks.  
 ``It's a vehicle contract that will end up in a vehicle
manufacturer's hands at the end of the day,''  Peter Arment , a
Greenwich, Connecticut-based analyst with American Technology
Research, said of the contest that will lead to the production
of 60,000 JLTVs. ``AM General/General Dynamics and  BAE/Navistar 
are the two teams that jump out as heavyweights.''  
 Lockheed and Boeing, the largest U.S. defense contractors,
in the past six years used their expertise linking networks of
sensors, computers and communications gear to snatch orders
valued at more than $170 billion from traditional manufacturers
of helicopters, ships and armored vehicles. Rising costs for
those programs may undermine claims by the two companies that
networking know-how trumps manufacturing experience.  
 The potential value of the JLTV award would exceed last
year's $27 billion in sales for Falls Church, Virginia-based
General Dynamics and surpass the combined 2006 revenue of $37
billion for London-based BAE and Navistar.  
 For Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, the program is
almost equal to last year's  sales  of $41.9 billion.  
 Troop Carrier  
 ``This could be incredibly lucrative,'' said Dean Lockwood,
a military-vehicle analyst at Forecast International in Newtown,
 Connecticut . ``You'd be crazy to not get involved.''  
 Next month, the U.S. Army and Marines, which are buying the
JLTV together, will award as many as three development contracts
worth $60 million apiece. That will set up a competition in 2011
to supply 60,000 vehicles over eight years. The JLTV, with 10
versions weighing from 3,500 pounds (1,588 kilograms) to 5,100
pounds, can serve as an infantry carrier, command post or
ambulance.  
 Blackwater Bidding  
 The other competitors include  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the
third-largest U.S. defense company, which leads a team with an
offering designed by  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) , the Wisconsin-based maker of
military trucks, snowplows and concrete mixers.  Raytheon Co. (RTN) ,
the No. 5 contractor, leads a bid with a truck from Blackwater
Worldwide, a closely held security-services firm. DRS
Technologies Inc., the maker of military electronics being
bought by Italy's  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , is paired with Force
Protection Inc., builder of the $500,000 Cougar Mine-Resistant,
Ambush-Protected vehicle, or MRAP.  
 JLTVs are intended to be more mobile than the Cougar and
offer better roadside-bomb protection than the $200,000 Humvee,
whose flat bottom traps an explosive's force beneath the
vehicle.  
 The JLTV will need to balance the ``iron triangle of
performance, protection and payload,'' said Kathryn Hasse,
director of tactical wheeled vehicles for Lockheed. The vehicles
also must provide access to voice and data networks in the
battlefield.  
 ``This is an integrated system; it's not just a truck
anymore,'' Hasse said.  
 Oval Office Aloft  
 That's the approach Lockheed took to beat United
Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky unit in 2005 for as many as 20 new
U.S. presidential helicopters, even though the Stratford,
Connecticut-based chopper maker had been the sole supplier for
half a century. Lockheed said networking expertise was needed to
build an ``Oval Office in the sky.'' The cost of the program has
increased 65 percent to $11.2 billion.  
 Chicago-based  Boeing (BA) , maker of the F/A-18 Super Hornet jet,
upset General Dynamics in 2002 for the Army's Future Combat
System of armored vehicles, drones and communications gear, the
Pentagon's second-largest program. To hold costs to $160.9
billion, the Army last year cut the project's scope to 14
systems from 18.  
 ``The major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed
are all trying to get in on this through systems integration,''
Lockwood said. ``The recent experience with system integrators
has not been a happy one on any of these programs and that could
become a factor in the JLTV contest.''  
 ``We know how to do the business,'' said Don Howe, senior
program director at  General Tactical Vehicles , the joint venture
between General Dynamics and closely held AM General, of South
Bend,  Indiana . ``My report card is the last five years
supporting the deployed troops.''  
 Share Performance  
 General Dynamics shares have  gained  12 percent in the past
year, compared with a 3.8 percent drop for the Standard & Poor's
Aerospace & Defense Index, as the Iraq war boosted sales.
Lockheed rose 12 percent, while Boeing dropped 22 percent after
suffering delays on the 787 commercial jetliner.  
 Lockheed would build the JLTV on the same production line
in Sealy,  Texas , where BAE made the Caiman, a larger version of
the MRAP that can carry 10. Lockheed formed the team with Armor
Holdings Inc. in October 2006, before BAE bought the
Jacksonville, Florida-based company last July for $4.53 billion.  
 Boeing is in a group led by  Textron Inc. (TXT) , an aircraft and
helicopter maker in Providence, Rhode Island, that builds the
Armored Security Vehicle used by Army military police. The team
also includes  Boeing's Future Combat System partner, SAIC Inc. 
of San Diego.  
 Boeing has deployed about 30 people from the Future Combat
System program to work on the Humvee replacement, said Jerry McElwee, vice president of advanced systems.  
 ``We feel that we have at least a reasonably good
understanding of the kinds of challenges the soldiers and the
Marines face,'' he said.
