             The Chinese yuan weakened 0.24
percent, the biggest decline since December 2008, after the
central bank sought more flexibility in the currency.  
 The currency dropped to 6.8130 per dollar at 9:49 a.m. in
Shanghai, following an advance of 0.42 percent yesterday.  
 “There is bigger two-way fluctuation, which is quite
normal,” said Lu Zhengwei, an economist at Industrial Bank Co.
in Shanghai. “The reference rate shows it is now based on
market demand and supply, and no longer strictly controlled.”
