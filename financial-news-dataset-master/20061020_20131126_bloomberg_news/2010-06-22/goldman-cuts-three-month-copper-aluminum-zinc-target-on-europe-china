             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  lowered its
near-term price forecasts for copper, aluminum and zinc as
markets remain “fragile” on concerns that the Europe debt
crisis may hamper growth and as China moves to cool its economy.  
 Copper will trade at $6,800 a metric ton in three months
time, 16 percent lower than a previous estimate, the bank’s
analysts led by  Allison Nathan  and  Jeffrey Currie  said in a
report dated today. The metal will climb to $7,900 a ton in six
months and to $8,050 in 12 months, gains of 1.9 percent and 2.5
percent, respectively, from the bank’s previous forecasts.  
 “We believe that the market is overestimating the impact
of current policy and maintain that sentiment is too bearish on
both the sovereign-debt risks as well as the effects of
macroeconomic momentum slowing,” the analysts wrote. “We
believe that the markets will remain fragile until there is
further evidence that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and
economic growth remains intact - both of which we expect.”  
 Commodities, as measured by the  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index ,
climbed to a five-week high yesterday after China, the world’s
third-biggest economy, signaled an end to the yuan’s peg to the
dollar. Still, the index has dropped 7 percent this year on
European and Chinese concerns, with copper slumping 11 percent
on the London Metal Exchange.  
 Copper for three-month delivery in London dropped as much
as 2 percent to $6,470 a ton today on concern that a stronger
Chinese currency will boost the cost the country’s exports. The
People’s Bank of China said on June 19 it will allow greater
“flexibility” in its currency, signaling it would abandon the
6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global crisis to
shield exporters.  
 Confidence Signal  
 The announcement was an “important signal of confidence in
the Chinese economy and global recovery,” the analysts wrote.
“Rising local exchange rates combined with rising wages,
potentially more taxes and royalties on local production, and
tighter environmentally-focused regulation, will likely increase
the cost of new production going forward.”  
 Aluminum will trade at $2,000 a ton in three months time,
Nathan and Currie wrote, 14 percent less than Goldman previously
predicted. The metal will trade at $2,150 in six months, up 6.7
percent, and $2,210 in 12 months, up 1.4 percent.  
 Goldman’s lowered its three-month zinc forecast 23 percent
to $2,000 a ton, and dropped its six and 12-month calls 18
percent to $2,100 and $2,225 respectively.  
 Its three-month nickel forecast was increased 20 percent to
$21,000 a ton, while the six-month forecast was raised 28
percent to $22,000 and the 12-month forecast boosted 17 percent
to $20,000.
