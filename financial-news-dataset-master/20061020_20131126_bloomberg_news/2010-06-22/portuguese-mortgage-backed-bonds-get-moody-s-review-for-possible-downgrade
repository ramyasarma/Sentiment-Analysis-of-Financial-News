             Portuguese bonds backed by
residential and company loans totaling 30.2 billion euros ($37.1
billion) may be downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The 23 mortgage-backed and 3 asset-backed securities are
being reviewed for a possible ratings cut as a result of Moody’s
decision last month to re-examine the country’s government
credit ranking, along with those of the nation’s banks, for a
possible reduction, the New York-based ratings company said
today in a statement. The bonds, ranked Aaa, the top grade, and
Aa, were created by lenders including Banco Santander Totta SA.  
 “The completion of Moody’s review of these ABS and RMBS
ratings will be driven by the conclusion of the ongoing review
of Portugal’s sovereign and bank ratings,” Moody’s said.  
 The ratings company put Portugal’s rating, the third-
highest investment grade, on review for downgrade on May 5
citing “recent deterioration of Portugal’s public finances as
well as the economy’s long-term growth challenges,” Moody’s
said at that time.
