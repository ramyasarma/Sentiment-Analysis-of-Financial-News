             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  will
offer institutional customers a futures brokerage service for
trading on exchanges and  clearinghouses  worldwide.  
 BNY Mellon Clearing LLC registered as a U.S.-based futures
commission merchant and intends to become a member of markets
around the globe, the company said today in statement
distributed by PR Newswire. Clearing members, which are
typically bank units, help capitalize clearinghouses, collect
daily margin and assume the risk of their customer trades to the
clearinghouse. They are responsible for making the clearinghouse
whole if a client defaults.  
 Sanjay Kannambadi , formerly the head of the bank’s office
of innovation, will serve as the unit’s chief executive officer,
according to the statement.  
 “The company’s formation is designed to anticipate the
rapid changes occurring in the clearing and settlement process
for derivatives,” Kannambadi said in the statement. Congress is
close to completing negotiations to regulate the $615 trillion
over-the-counter derivatives market for the first time in its
30-year history.  
 Exchange-traded derivatives such as futures are regulated
by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
