             House lawmakers asked Johnson &
Johnson Chief Executive Officer  Bill Weldon  to come before
Congress and explain the drugmaker’s actions in an inquiry into
defective children’s medicine made by the company.  
 Weldon was invited to testify at the June 30 hearing in a
letter today from New York Democratic Representative  Edolphus Towns , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee. Lawmakers have been looking into J&J’s actions
surrounding the April recall of more than 40 children’s
medicines and subsequent allegations that the company hid
efforts to do an unpublicized recall of defective Motrin tablets
in 2009.  
 Lawmakers, led by Towns, increasingly have focused on the
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company’s actions surrounding a
plan to buy back the defective Motrin without fully notifying
the Food and Drug Administration. Since the April 30 recall, J&J
 shares  have fallen about 7.4 percent.  
 J&J spokesman  Jeff Leebaw  didn’t respond immediately to a
phone call and e-mail asking whether Weldon would attend the
hearing.  Colleen Goggins , J&J’s worldwide consumer group
chairman, testified at a hearing last month in Weldon’s place
while the CEO was recuperating from back surgery.
