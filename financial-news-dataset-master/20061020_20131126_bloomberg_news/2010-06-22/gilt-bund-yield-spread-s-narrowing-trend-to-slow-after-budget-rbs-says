             The narrowing of the  extra yield 
that U.K. bonds pay over bunds will probably slow after
investors bought gilts anticipating spending cuts in today’s
budget, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 “The U.K. is still a good spread bet, we like it, we can
see it narrowing a lot versus bunds here,”  Andrew Roberts , head
of European rates strategy in London, wrote in a client note
today. “But our 30 basis points to 50 basis points narrowing
will be a slower burn now, especially without any perceived
fireworks.”  
 The difference in yield, or spread, between benchmark 10-
year German bunds and gilts was at 76 basis points today,
compared with 103 basis points on May 7, the day after Britain’s
election.
