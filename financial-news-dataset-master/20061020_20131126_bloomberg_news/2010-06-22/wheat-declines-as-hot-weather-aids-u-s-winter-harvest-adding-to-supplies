             Wheat fell for the third straight
session as hot weather dries fields enough for U.S. farmers to
collect their grain in the southern Great Plains.  
 The harvest in central to west-central Oklahoma was as much
as 98 percent complete as of June 20, the state’s wheat
commission said yesterday. In the southwestern corner of the
state, 20 percent of the harvest is done, and yields are
averaging about 50 bushels an acre, said industry group Kansas
Wheat in a report today.  
 “We’re getting weakness from harvest pressure,” said
 Jamey Kohake , a broker at Paragon Investments in Silver Lake,
Kansas. “I haven’t heard about huge yields. I heard from few of
my customers who said yields were in the mid-40s west of
Oklahoma City.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $4.7325 a bushel at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, the price dropped 12 percent this year,
partly on increased stockpiles.  
 As of June 20, 17 percent of the U.S. winter crop was
collected, up from 9 percent the prior week, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. In Kansas, 10 percent was harvested
versus 1 percent a week earlier. In Oklahoma, 53 percent was
collected, up from 38 percent. Kansas is the largest producer of
winter varieties, followed by Oklahoma and Texas.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
