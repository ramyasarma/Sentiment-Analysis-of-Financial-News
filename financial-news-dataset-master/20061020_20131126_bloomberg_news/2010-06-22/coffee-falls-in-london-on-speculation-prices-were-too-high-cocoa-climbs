             Cocoa rose the most in three weeks
in New York amid tight supplies and adverse weather in Ivory
Coast, the world’s largest producer. Sugar declined.  
 The central-western Daloa region, the biggest Ivorian
cocoa-growing area geographically, got 77.6 millimeters (3.1
inches) of rainfall from June 1 to June 10, according to the
National Meteorological Service. A year earlier, the area had no
rain. Prices have fallen 7.1 percent this year.  
 “Weather conditions, a little too much rain in Ivory
Coast” helped boost prices, said  Phil Streible , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “That’s something that
can cause problems for the crop as far as disease and things
like that.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose $70, or 2.3 percent, to
$3,055 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. That marked the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 27. Earlier,
the price reached $3,086, the highest level since June 4.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for July delivery
rose 51 pounds, or 2.1 percent, to 2,516 pounds ($3,735) a
metric ton.  
 The rally accelerated after futures topped so-called price-
resistance levels, Streible said.  
 Raw-sugar futures for October delivery fell 0.04 cent, or
0.3 percent, to 15.92 cents a pound in New York.  
 Refined-sugar futures for October delivery were little
changed $467.40 a ton in London.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery were little
changed at $1.6075 a pound in New York. Yesterday, the price
dropped 0.8 percent after reaching $1.6545, a 27-month high.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery  dropped $4,
or 0.3 percent, to $1,569 a ton in London.
