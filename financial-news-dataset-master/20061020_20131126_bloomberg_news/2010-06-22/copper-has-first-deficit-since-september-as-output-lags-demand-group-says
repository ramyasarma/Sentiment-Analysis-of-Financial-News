             The copper market was in deficit in
March for the first time since September as production fell
113,000 metric tons below demand, according to the  International
Copper Study Group .  
 The world refined-copper market was in deficit by 1,000
tons in the first quarter, compared with a year-earlier surplus
of 139,000 tons, the Lisbon-based industry body said in a report
on its website today.  
 Global output of refined metal increased to 1.59 million
tons in March from 1.47 million tons in the prior month,
according to the ICSG. World demand climbed to 1.70 million tons
from 1.44 million tons in February, the report shows.  
 “A strong increase in usage in March in major consuming
countries led to the refined copper production deficit,” the
group said.  
 First-quarter mine output increased 0.7 percent globally,
equal to 30,000 tons, according to the group.  
 “Production was still affected by lower output in the
United States, Peru and Indonesia, where aggregated production
decreased by 9 percent,” the ICSG said. In Chile, the world’s
largest producer, output rose 2.8 percent, the report shows.
