             Crude oil dropped for the first time
in three days as sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly fell
in May, signaling the economy is struggling to recover.  
 Oil declined after  purchases  of previously owned houses
decreased 2.2 percent, missing expectations. Oil extended
declines after a New Orleans federal judge lifted the six-month
moratorium on deepwater drilling imposed by President  Barack Obama  following the largest oil spill in U.S. history.  
 “The worry for the crude market ultimately is that we
could have a double-dip recession,”  Bill O’Grady , chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis,
said in an interview.  
 Crude oil for July delivery fell 61 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $77.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Oil has risen 15 percent in the past year. July crude
expired at the close of floor trading. The more active August
contract lost 76 cents, or 1 percent, to $77.85 a barrel.  
 Prices declined from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 3.69 million barrels to 362.4 million in
the seven days ended June 18, the biggest jump in eight weeks.
August oil fell $1.16, or 1.5 percent, to $77.45 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  
 U.S. home sales decreased to a 5.66 million annual rate in
May from 5.79 million in April, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed today in Washington. They were
forecast to rise to a 6.12 million rate, according to the  median 
estimate of 74 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 To receive a government incentive worth as much as $8,000,
buyers must have signed contracts by the end of April and need
to complete deals by the end of this month.  
 Drilling Halt  
 Obama temporarily halted all drilling in waters deeper than
500 feet on May 27 to give a presidential commission time to
study improvements in the safety of offshore operations. More
than a dozen Louisiana offshore service and supply companies
sued U.S. regulators to lift the ban. Shares of drilling
services companies jumped on the ruling.  
 The government said it would appeal the decision.  
 “The news is going to ease prices a bit,” said  Rich Ilczyszyn , a senior market strategist with broker Lind-Waldock
in Chicago. “It’s going to take a good four to six weeks, maybe
as much as three months, to get things rolling again.”  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecasts for crude
oil because commodity markets are “fragile” amid concern that
growth in Europe and China will slow, according to a report
today by analysts led by  Allison Nathan  in New York. The bank
reduced its average estimate for New York-traded oil by 9.1
percent for 2011 to $100 a barrel.  
 Equities Decline  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 1.2 percent to
1,099.46 at 3:28 p.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 110.19 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,332.22.  
 The euro lost 0.3 percent to $1.2276 compared with $1.2312
yesterday in New York. Earlier, it fell as much as 0.5 percent.
A weaker euro against the dollar curbs the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment.  
 China’s central bank said June 19 it will increase
flexibility in the yuan, marking an end to the crisis policy of
pegging to the dollar. European governments have been trying to
stave off a sovereign-debt crisis.  
 Brent crude for August delivery dropped 78 cents, or 1
percent, to $78.04 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London.  
 Inventory Survey  
 U.S. oil inventories probably dropped last week on
estimates that imports declined for the first time in three
weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Stockpiles  fell 800,000 barrels in the seven days ended
June 18 from 363.1 million the week before, according to the
median of 15 analyst  estimates  before an Energy Department
report tomorrow. Ten of the respondents forecast a decrease and
five estimated a gain.  
 “Given the way things are playing out fundamentally,
things should probably trade back down toward the mid-$70s,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  
 U.S. gasoline demand rose for a second consecutive week as
prices at the pump were little changed at a 14-week low,
according to MasterCard Inc.’s weekly SpendingPulse report.
Motorists bought 0.4 percent more gasoline in the week ended
June 18 from the week before, or an average 9.311 million
barrels a day of the motor fuel.  
 Gasoline for July delivery fell 0.93 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.1335 a gallon on the Nymex.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 427,520
contracts as of 3:30 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 551,377
contracts yesterday, 29 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.27 million contracts, the
lowest level since Feb. 22.
