             Sidley Austin LLP  said  Thomas Albrecht , a member of the law firm’s management and executive
committees, will move to Hong Kong from its Chicago headquarters
as Asia Pacific managing partner to look at adding offices.  
 “Increased client demand compels us to plan for growth and
to consider other jurisdictions where we should add offices,”
Albrecht said in a statement today. Sidley has about 120 lawyers
in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai,  Singapore , Sydney and Tokyo.  
 Sidley’s clients include United Co. Rusal, which it
represented for its $2.24 billion initial public offering in
Hong Kong, the Chinese Ministry of Finance and Sands China Ltd.
It was the world’s ninth highest-grossing law firm in 2009 with
nearly  $1.5 billion in revenue , according to the American Lawyer.  
 Albrecht succeeds  William Fifield , who will return to the
U.S. at the end of 2010, according to the statement. Sidley’s
Asian hires in the past year include  Alan Linning , previously
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s head of compliance in Asia and  Alex Lloyd 
from London-based Clifford Chance LLP.
