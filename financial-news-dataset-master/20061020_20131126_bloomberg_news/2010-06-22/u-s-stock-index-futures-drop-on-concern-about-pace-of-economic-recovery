             U.S. stocks sank, with benchmark
gauges declining the most in almost three weeks, as home sales
unexpectedly dropped and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped
for a second day below chart levels monitored by analysts.  
 Alcoa Inc. ,  Caterpillar Inc.  and  Home Depot Inc.  fell more
than 2.5 percent after the National Association of Realtors said
sales of previously owned homes decreased 2.2 percent in May.
 Halliburton Co.  dropped 3.9 percent as the Obama administration
said it will appeal a judge’s decision to lift the White House’s
deep-water drilling ban.  FedEx Corp.  slid 3 percent as
transportation stocks retreated the most of 24 S&P 500 groups.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 1.6 percent to 1,095.31 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. The benchmark gauge fell below its average price over
the last 200 days, a bearish signal to technical analysts.  The
Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 148.89 points, or 1.4
percent, to 10,293.52.  
 “It’s just a sloppy environment,” said  Stephen Wood , who
helps manage about $179 billion as chief market strategist for
Russell Investments in New York. “The housing recovery is very
fragile. Then, there’s the Gulf situation decreasing earnings
visibility. You’re going to get a lot of volatility.”  
 The VIX, as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index  is known, surged 8.7 percent to 27.05, the biggest gain
since June 4. The measure, which tends to rise when investors
are paying more for protection from losses in the S&P 500,
surpassed 40 in May for the first time in almost 13 months.  
 Reversing Gains  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday, erasing an earlier gain, as a
retreat in retail and technology shares outweighed China’s
decision to relax its currency’s fixed rate to the dollar. The
benchmark for U.S. equities has gained 4.3 percent since June 7
and completed its biggest two-week rally since November on June
18 as concern about Europe’s debt crisis eased.  
 Equities reversed gains in the first half hour of trading
today after the National Association of Realtors said  purchases 
of existing houses, which are tabulated when a contract closes,
decreased to a 5.66 million annual rate. Existing home sales
were forecast to rise to a 6.12 million rate, according to the
 median  forecast of 74 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “There’s fear of a double dip in housing,” said  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at Chicago-based Harris Private
Bank, which oversees $55 billion. “We’re waiting for other
economic figures and the Fed’s statement this week.”  
 Federal Reserve policy makers will issue a statement about
the outlook for interest rates and the economy tomorrow at
around 2:15 p.m. Washington time following a two-day meeting.  
 A gauge of 12  homebuilders  in S&P indexes dropped 2.3
percent, as Pulte Group Inc. and D.R. Horton Inc. declined at
least 3 percent.  
 Home Depot, the largest home-improvement retailer, lost 2.6
percent to $30.61. Alcoa slid 3.7 percent to $11.29. Caterpillar
slumped 3 percent to $64.11.  
 Technical Levels  
 The S&P 500 fell below its 200-day average of about 1,111,
and its close below that level may signal more losses, according
to analysts who study charts to make forecasts.  
 “It’s not a good signal,” said  Michael O’Rourke , chief
market strategist at BTIG LLC in Yardley, Pennsylvania, which
serves institutional investors. “That’s not all. Lack of volume
is also negative. Investors won’t be making big moves unless the
economic data or earnings season provide a catalyst.”  
 A rally on the S&P 500 yesterday fizzled above 1,120.84,
the level marking a 50 percent recovery of its October 2007 to
March 2009 plunge, and 1,130.29, the midpoint of its intraday
highs and lows in 2010. About 8.3 billion shares changed hands
on all U.S. exchanges today, 19 percent fewer than this year’s
average.  
 Transportation Stocks  
 Transportation stocks , which are sensitive to economic
performance, fell 3.4 percent for the biggest decline among 24
industries in the S&P 500.  
 FedEx, the world’s largest air-cargo carrier, tumbled 3
percent to $76.20.  United Parcel Service Inc.  slumped 2.9
percent to $60.40.  
 A 3.9 percent decline in the  Dow Jones Transportation
Average  pared its lead since June 7 over the industrial gauge, a
spread some investors view as a sign of U.S. economic strength.
The measure of companies from Ryder Systems Inc. to FedEx is up
5.6 percent since falling to a four-month low, while the 30-
stock industrial average is up 4.9 percent.  
 “Jitters about the economy are out today,” said  Eric Marshall , who helps oversee about $1 billion as research
director of Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management Inc. “I
think it’s tied to the fact that the most cyclical stocks are
the ones that are down the most today.”  
 Walgreen Co.  dropped 6.5 percent to $28.17. The largest
U.S. drugstore chain said third-quarter profit declined on
expenses related to its purchase of Duane Reade Holdings Inc.
and changes in Medicare benefits. Excluding certain items,
profit was 53 cents. Analysts projected 58 cents, the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Gulf Spill  
 Oil drillers fell as the Obama administration said it will
appeal a federal judge’s ruling lifting a six-month moratorium
on deepwater drilling imposed after the BP Plc oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary  Robert Gibbs  said.  
 Transocean Ltd. , which leased to BP the Deepwater Horizon
oil rig, dropped 2.6 percent to $52.49. Halliburton fell 3.9
percent to $25.99. BP slid 2.1 percent to $29.68.  
 Big Lots Inc.  fell 8 percent to $31.56, the biggest decline
in the S&P 500. The retailer was downgraded to “neutral” from
“overweight” by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Carnival Corp.  fell 4.5 percent to $33.19. The cruise ship
operator said third-quarter earnings will be as low as $1.43 per
share. Analysts on average forecast earnings of $1.51 per share,
according to a survey by Bloomberg.  
 Market Drivers  
 “We’re at crossroads,” said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps
manage about $2.2 billion as co-chief investment officer at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. “The question remains
-- will the consumer step up and sustain a rebound? I don’t see
great drivers motivating the stock market.”  
 Apple Inc.  gained 1.4 percent to $273.85 after saying it
sold three million iPads as of June 21, just 80 days after its
introduction in the U.S. Deutsche Bank AG raised its share-price
estimate to $375 from $350, saying demand for iPhones and iPods
exceeds its expectations.  
 “There’s so much good news out of Apple,” said  Bruce Bittles , chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert
W. Baird & Co., which oversees more than $85 billion in client
assets. “Technology has been one of our favorite sectors. It
has some of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world.
It has a better chance to outperform the market.”
      Jefferies Group Inc.  climbed 5.7 percent to $24.17. The New
York-based securities firm that specializes in mid-sized
companies reported second-quarter net income was $84.8 million,
or 41 cents a share. Jefferies was expected to report a profit
of 34 cents, the average of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.
