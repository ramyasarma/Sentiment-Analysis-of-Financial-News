             France’s  CAC 40 Index  slipped 30.83,
or 0.8 percent, to 3,705.32 in Paris.  The SBF 120 Index  also
declined 0.8 percent.  
 Bank stocks led the drop after Fitch Ratings cut its credit
rating on BNP Paribas SA.  
 BNP slid 1.9 percent to 49.36 euros after two days of
gains. Fitch cut the rating for France’s largest bank one step
to AA-, the fourth-highest investment grade, citing a
“deterioration” of the company’s asset quality. The outlook is
stable, Fitch said.  
 Societe Generale SA, France’s second-biggest lender by
market value, lost 4 percent to 37.35 euros. Credit Agricole SA,
the country’s largest bank by branches, retreated 4.7 percent to
9.49 euros.  
 Dexia SA, Belgium’s biggest bank by assets, slid 1.3
percent to 3.33 euros.  
 The following shares rose or fell in Paris. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 Bureau Veritas SA  (BVI FP) climbed 1.1 percent to 45.81
euros, gaining for a fourth day. The company agreed to buy
Inspectorate from 3i Group Plc for 450 million pounds ($662
million) to become one of the three largest commodity-testing
businesses. The operation will add to earnings per share from
the first year, Chief Executive Officer  Frank Piedelievre  said.  
 Technip SA  (TEC FP), Europe’s second-largest oilfield-
services provider, decreased 2.5 percent to 52.89 euros. The
stock was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Societe Generale.
