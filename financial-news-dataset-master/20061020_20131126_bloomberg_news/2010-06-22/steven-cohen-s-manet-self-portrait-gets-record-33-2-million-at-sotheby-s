             Edouard Manet’s  “Self Portrait with
a Palette” sold tonight in London for 22.4 million pounds
($33.2 million) with fees, a record for the artist at auction.  
 It was bought by New York dealer Franck Giraud, who was
bidding in the room. The work had been estimated to fetch
between 20 million pounds and 30 million pounds at hammer
prices. The Manet is among 51 lots in  Sotheby’s  sale of
Impressionist and modern works.  
 Two weeks of evening sales of Impressionist and
contemporary works at Sotheby’s,  Christie’s International  and
Phillips de Pury & Co. carry an estimate of 350 million pounds,
more than three times last year’s total low estimate.  
 “It’s a great Manet,” New York art dealer  Christophe van de Weghe  said in an interview at the sale. “Many museums would
like to have this picture. It was a good buy at the low
estimate.”  
 The 1878 painting, showing Manet dressed as a Parisian
dandy, rather than as a working artist, is a well-known
highlight of the art collection formed by  Steven A. Cohen ,
founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP. Cohen paid $18.7 million for
the painting at  Christie’s International’s  1997 auction of the
collection of the Wall Street financier  John Loeb . The seller
wasn’t named by Sotheby’s.  
 The previous highest price paid for the French artist was
$26.4 million, for the 1878 street scene “La rue Mosnier aux
drapeaux” at Christie’s in New York in November 1989.  
 Picasso Tomorrow  
 Recent record auction prices for trophies by Impressionist
and modern masters have encouraged collectors to sell high-value
works.  Pablo Picasso’s  1903 Blue Period “Portrait of Angel
Fernandez de Soto (The Absinthe Drinker)” is being offered by
 Andrew Lloyd Webber , the composer, at Christie’s tomorrow. It is
expected to raise as much as 40 million pounds, Christie’s said.  
 The highest price achieved at auction for a work by an
Impressionist- or Post-Impressionist-period artist is the 40.9
million pounds paid for the 1919 Monet canvas “Le Bassin aux
Nympheas” at Christie’s in London in June 2008.
