             Credit Agricole SA , France’s largest
bank by branches, said it will take a 400 million-euro ($490
million) writedown on its stake in Emporiki Bank of Greece SA as
it expects higher losses at the unit this year.  
 The lender will book the writedown in the  earnings  period
ending June 30, the Paris-based company said in a statement
today. Emporiki’s estimated 2010 after-tax losses may reach
about 750 million euros, more than twice as much as estimated in
October, according to a presentation on the bank’s website.  
 “Credit Agricole will support Emporiki,” the lender said,
adding that the Greek unit has “good dynamics” in operating
profit. Emporiki may get a “potential punctual Tier 1
requirement of approximately 550 million euros” by the end of
2011, it said.  
 “Credit Agricole SA’s results will be positive in the
second quarter despite the goodwill depreciation that will be
recorded,” Chief Financial Officer  Bertrand Badre  told analysts
on a call today, the bank said in an e-mail.  
 The European Union and the International Monetary Fund
agreed on May 2 to provide 110 billion euros in emergency loans
to Greece, which is struggling to cut a deficit that swelled to
13.6 percent, more than four times the EU limit. French banks
have claims on Greece of $78.8 billion, most than any other
country, according to the Bank for International Settlements.  
 Emporiki , which had a net loss of 583 million euros in
2009, expects to return to profit in 2012, Credit Agricole said.  
 Emporiki increased its estimate for 2010 losses as it
expects an “adverse scenario” of the Greek gross domestic
product contracting by 4.4 percent this year, worse than the 4
percent GDP decline forecast by the IMF and by Greek
authorities, it said.
