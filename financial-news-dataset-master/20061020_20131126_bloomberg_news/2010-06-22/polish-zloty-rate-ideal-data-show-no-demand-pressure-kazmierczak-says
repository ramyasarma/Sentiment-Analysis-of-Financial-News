             May core inflation data confirm that
Poland’s economy isn’t experiencing demand pressure and that the
central bank’s 2.5 percent inflation target is not now at risk,
Andrzej Kazmierczak of the Monetary Policy Council said today by
phone.  
 Poland’s recovery is “stable but weak,” which supports
the bank’s price-stability mandate, Kazmierczak said. He added
that the zloty’s current exchange rate is “ideal” because it
doesn’t fuel inflation and at the same time encourages exports
and economic growth.
