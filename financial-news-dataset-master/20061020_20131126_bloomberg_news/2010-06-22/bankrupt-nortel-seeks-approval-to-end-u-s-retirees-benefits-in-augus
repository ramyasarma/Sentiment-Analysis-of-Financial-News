             Nortel Networks Corp. , the insolvent
maker of telecommunications equipment, sought a judge’s
permission to cut off medical and disability benefits to more
than 4,000 former U.S. employees.  
 Nortel, based in Toronto, today asked a bankruptcy judge in
Delaware overseeing the case to let it stop the benefits, which
are costing the company $2 million a month, at the end of
August. A hearing is scheduled for July 16.  
 “Providing these benefits is a significant financial
burden that does not provide any concomitant benefits to the
debtor’s estates,” Nortel said in court papers. “The
individuals currently receiving the benefits of such
expenditures are not providing services to the debtors.”  
 Nortel had agreed to pay benefits to 19,800 retired and
disabled Canadian workers to the end of the year by creating a
C$57 million ($56 million) fund. That agreement was upheld by
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which refused to hear a request
from some workers to annul the agreement, approved by a lower
court judge.  
 Currently, 4,019 retirees and family members receive
medical benefits, while 280 individuals get long-term disability
benefits, according to the company. Nortel said it negotiated an
agreement with UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co. to provide medical
coverage to the retirees if they choose to buy it.  
 Nortel, once North America’s biggest maker of
telecommunications equipment, has been auctioning its  assets 
since filing for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the U.S. in
January 2009.  
 The U.S. case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-10138, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The
Canadian case is In the matter of a plan of compromise or
arrangement of Nortel Networks Corp., 09-CL-7950, Ontario
Superior Court of Justice (Toronto).
