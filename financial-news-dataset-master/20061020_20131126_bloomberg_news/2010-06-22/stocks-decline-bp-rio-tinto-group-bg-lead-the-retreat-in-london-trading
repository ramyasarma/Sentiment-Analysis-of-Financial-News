             U.K. stocks dropped the most in more
than two weeks as basic-resources shares retreated on
speculation yesterday’s gains may have been overdone.  
 Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. dropped 3 percent.  BG
Group Plc  slid 3.6 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut
its recommendation on the shares. BP Plc slipped 4.4 percent.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  retreated 52.13, or 1 percent,
to 5,246.98 in London. U.K. stocks rallied yesterday to the
highest level in more than a month after China signaled an end
to the yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar, boosting confidence in
the global economic recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index  slid 0.9
percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  decreased 1.5 percent.  
 “Traders in London have a more cautious view on the change
today,” Anthony Grech, head of research at IG Index in London,
wrote in a note, referring to China’s move. “This has knocked
some of the wind out of commodity prices and dragged mining
stocks down.”  
 China’s yuan declined 0.2 percent against the dollar today,
the most since December 2008, on speculation the central bank
will intervene to limit gains after dropping the two-year peg to
the dollar. A weaker yuan increases the price of commodities for
buyers in China, the world’s biggest consumer of copper.  
 ENRC, Kazakhmys  
 ENRC retreated 3 percent to 1,030 pence. Kazakhmys Plc,
Kazakhstan’s largest copper producer, slid 3.2 percent to 1,196
pence. Xstrata Plc, the world’s fourth-largest copper producer,
slipped 2.6 percent to 1,048 pence.  
 The  FTSE 350 Mining Index  slid 1.9 percent after yesterday
rallying 4.2 percent, the biggest gain in almost a month.  
 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced a
levy on banks and an increase in sales tax today as part of an
emergency budget aimed at guarding the country’s top credit
rating without strangling economic recovery.  
 Forecasting growth of 1.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent
in 2011, Osborne said he will tax bank balance sheets starting
next year to generate 2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of annual
revenue. The value-added tax rate will rise to 20 percent in
January from 17.5 percent.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc rose 0.7 percent to 47.08
pence after the bank levy was unveiled. Lloyds Banking Group Plc
gained 4.1 percent to 59 pence.  
 ‘Everyday Essentials’  
 Supermarket shares rose as Osborne pledged to keep
“everyday essentials” such as food exempt from the sales tax.  
 Tesco Plc, the U.K.’s biggest retailer, advanced 1.3
percent to 393 pence. William Morrison Supermarkets Plc, the
smallest of the U.K.’s four main grocers, climbed 2.6 percent to
268.1 pence.  
 BG lost 3.6 percent to 1,084 pence. The U.K.’s third-
largest natural-gas producer was downgraded to “neutral” from
“buy” at Goldman Sachs after recent share-price gains.  
 BP dropped 4.4 percent to 334.20 pence. The oil company
aims to sell assets, improve its safety standards and may
replace Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  as part of a three-
stage recovery plan after shares plummeted in the wake of the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Handelsblatt reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  
 The following shares rose or fell in London. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 Carnival Corp.  (CCL LN) sank 5 percent to 2,424 pence, its
lowest level since February. The biggest cruise-line operator
said the currency exchange rate hurt earnings $97 million since
March. The company sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per
share of $1.43 to $1.47. That’s lower than the analyst estimate
of $1.51.  
 Chemring Group Plc  (CHG LN) dropped 6 percent to 3,111
pence, falling the most since March 2009. The developer of
missile-avoidance gear for the U.S.’s Joint Strike Fighter said
first-half net income fell to 18.4 million pounds from 21.5
million pounds.  
 EasyJet Plc  (EZJ LN) slid 3.1 percent to 413.3 pence,
declining the most in more than a month. The airline was cut to
“neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Whitbread Plc  (WTB LN) jumped 3.6 percent to 1,531 pence,
its highest level since April 28. The U.K. operator of the Costa
Coffee chain said fiscal first-quarter sales at outlets open at
least a year rose 7.6 percent, led by its Premier Inn budget-
hotel chain.
