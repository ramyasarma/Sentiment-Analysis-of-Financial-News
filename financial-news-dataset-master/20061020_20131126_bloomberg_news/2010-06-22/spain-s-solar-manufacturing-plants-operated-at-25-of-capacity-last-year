             Spanish factories making solar
panels operated at 25 percent of capacity last year as domestic
demand for solar generators evaporated, the Photovoltaic
Industry Association said.  
 Three quarters of the panels produced in Spain were
exported as installation of new photovoltaic plants in the
country declined by 99 percent compared with 2008, the Madrid-
based lobby group said in a press note today.
