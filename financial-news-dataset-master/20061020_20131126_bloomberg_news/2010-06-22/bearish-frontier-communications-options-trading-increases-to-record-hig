             Bets that  Frontier Communications
Corp.  will lose more than a third of its value by August boosted
bearish options trading on the phone company serving rural U.S.
markets to a record.  
 Almost 87,000  puts  on Frontier changed hands, 66 times the
four-week average. Shares of the Stamford, Connecticut-based
company, which is suing Google Inc. for patent infringement,
fell 2.2 percent to $7.69.  
 Almost all of today’s  volume  was concentrated in two trades
in which investors bought July and August $7.50 puts while
selling about the same number of $5 puts in those months, a
strategy known as a spread trade that pays the most if the stock
falls below the lower strike price by expiration. Frontier
shares haven’t close below $5 since July 2002.  
 “The motivation for the trades could be outright bearish,”
said  Caitlin Duffy , an equity options analyst at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc. “But it could
also be someone buying downside protection if they’re long with
a large position in Frontier.”  
 Frontier sued  Google , accusing the operator of the world’s
largest Internet search engine of infringement of a patent for
enhanced telephone services, according to a complaint today in
federal court in Delaware.
