             Kenya Electricity Generating Co. ,
the country’s largest power producer, started producing power
today at a 35-megawatt geothermal power plant.  
 KenGen, as the state-owned company is known, will add a
further 350 megawatts of geothermal capacity by 2013, Managing
Director  Eddy Njoroge  said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “Our increased investment in geothermal power production
is also in line with KenGen’s business strategy of reducing
reliance on hydro power which is dependent on weather patterns,
and to pursue green energy sources which are safe to the
environment,” Njoroge said.  
 The new plant at Olkaria, about 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northwest of Nairobi, was co-financed by the European Investment
Bank, which provided $40.8 million, the International
Development Association and the French Development Agency.  
 The three financiers have already pledged to provide
funding for construction of another 280-megawatt power project
in Olkaria.
