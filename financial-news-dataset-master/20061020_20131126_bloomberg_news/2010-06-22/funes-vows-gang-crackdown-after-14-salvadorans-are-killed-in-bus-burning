             El Salvador’s President  Mauricio Funes  vowed to crack down on youth gangs after alleged members
of one of largest groups in the capital, San Salvador, were
arrested for burning a bus outside the city in an attack that
killed 14 people.  
 “It was a terrorist act,” Funes said in an e-mailed
statement. “Those who committed this act sought to create
terror. These acts will make us step up our security forces.”  
 Funes said his Cabinet met late today to decide how to
boost security against youth gangs that systemically extort bus
drivers and passengers with threats of violence.  
 At least seven suspects have been detained, most of them
alleged members of the Mara 18 gang, since the bus attack late
yesterday, Funes said.
