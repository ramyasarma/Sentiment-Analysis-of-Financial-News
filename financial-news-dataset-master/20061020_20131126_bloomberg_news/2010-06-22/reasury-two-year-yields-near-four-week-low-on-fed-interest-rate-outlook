             Treasury two-year  yields  were near
the lowest level since May on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reiterate its pledge to keep interest rates near zero to
help spur the recovery.  
 Treasuries of all maturities are headed for the best first
half in a decade on speculation reduced inflationary pressures
will prompt policy makers to repeat their pledge to keep
borrowing costs low at the end of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s two-day meeting starting today. The Treasury will
sell a combined $108 billion of two-, five- and seven-year notes
this week, the least for those securities since June 2009.  
 “The FOMC is not going to move and the language is not
going to change because it’s too early for the Fed to even
contemplate moving rates,” said  Kumar Palghat , who helps manage
the equivalent of $1.6 billion at Kapstream Capital in Sydney.
“Economic data in the U.S. is mixed and you still have the
European overhang.”  
 The  two-year note  yielded 0.72 percent as of 8:53 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The yield fell to 0.69
percent on June 17, the lowest level since May 25. The 0.75
percent security due May 2012 traded at 100 2/32.  
 The government will auction $40 billion in two-year debt
today, $38 billion in five-year notes tomorrow and $30 billion
in seven-year securities on June 24. The total is $5 billion
less than last month’s sales.  
 ‘Relatively Strong’  
 “The two-year auction won’t be a home run, but demand in
the front end is still relatively strong,” said  Jason Rogan ,
director of U.S. government trading in New York at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors.  
 Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 36 percent of the two-year notes at the
prior auction on May 25, compared with an average of 42 percent
over the past 10 sales.  
 The two-year notes to be auctioned today yielded 0.75
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.769 percent at
the previous sale.  
 The Federal Reserve will hold the benchmark  interest rate 
at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent at this week’s
meeting, according to all of the 96 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.
