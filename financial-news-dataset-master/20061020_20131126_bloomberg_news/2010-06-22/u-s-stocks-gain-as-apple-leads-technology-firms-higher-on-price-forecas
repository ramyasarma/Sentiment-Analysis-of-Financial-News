             U.S. stocks rose as Apple Inc. led
technology companies higher on an increased share-price forecast
at Deutsche Bank AG, offsetting concern the market’s recent
rally overshot prospects for the economy.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed less than 0.1
percent to 1,113.44 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average increased 22.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to
10,465.38.
