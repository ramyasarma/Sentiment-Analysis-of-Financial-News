             Google Inc. , operator of the world’s
largest Internet search engine, was sued by  Frontier
Communications Corp.  and accused of infringing a new patent for
enhanced telephone services.  
 Google is violating patent rights with products such as the
Google Voice system, Frontier, based in Stamford, Connecticut,
contended today in a complaint in federal court in Delaware.  
 “Google’s deliberate infringement of the patent has
greatly and irreparably damaged Frontier,” the plaintiff’s
lawyers said in court papers seeking unspecified damages and an
injunction to stop the use of the technology.  
 Google, based in Mountain View, California, agreed last
month to buy  Global IP Solutions Holding AB , a maker of voice
and videoconferencing software, for about $68 million to help
expand Internet video and audio capabilities.  
 “We believe these claims are entirely without merit, and
we’ll defend against them vigorously,”  Andrew Pederson , a
spokesman for Google, said by e-mail.  
 Google, with revenue of $23.7 billion last year, fell $2.31
to $486.25 today in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has
declined 22 percent this year.  
 Frontier, with $2.12 billion in 2009  sales , fell 17 cents
to $7.69 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has
dropped 1.5 percent this year.  
 The case is Frontier Communications Corp. v. Google Inc.,
10-cv-545, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).
