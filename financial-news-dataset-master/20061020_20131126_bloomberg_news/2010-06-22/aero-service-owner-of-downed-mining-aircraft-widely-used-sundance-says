             Aero Service, the Republic of Congo
charter company whose plane crashed over the weekend carrying 11
passengers including the board of Sundance Resources Ltd., is
widely used in Africa, Sundance said.  
 The twin turboprop Casa C212, carrying six Australian
mining executives including millionaire  Ken Talbot , crashed
while flying to Yangadou in Congo from Cameroon’s capital
Yaounde after taking off on June 19. The wreckage of the plane
was found in dense jungle in the Republic of Congo with no
survivors, Sundance said in a statement.  
 Sundance had used Aero Service as recently as February or
March when a board member was taken to Sundance’s iron ore
project, spokesman David Brook said by phone. Aero Service,
which is banned from flying within the European Union according
to a notice on the European Commission  website , is “used
widely” in Africa, he said.  
 Aero Service, with a fleet of seven passenger and cargo
planes, has had a total of three crashes in the past five years,
according to the Aviation Safety Network  website . Calls to Aero
Services office in Republic of Congo’s second-largest city
Pointe Noire, weren’t answered.  
 Military Use  
 The twin propeller-powered C212 uses a high wing design,
meaning they are placed above the cabin. The plane is popular
for military use because it can land and take off with less than
600 meters (1,969 feet) of unprepared runway and has a range of
more than 1,000 kilometers, according to the European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co.  website . More than 470 of the planes have
been sold, EADS said.  
 Sundance is among companies exploring and building mines
in Africa, attracted by its mineral riches, including the
world’s biggest deposits of platinum, chrome and diamonds. The
company aims to complete an initial study for its $3.4 billion
Mbalam iron-ore project in Cameroon by the end of 2010.  
 Xstrata Plc , exploring the Zanaga iron ore project in
Republic of Congo, said it doesn’t use Aero Service. “We ran a
check on which company we are using over the weekend, and we’re
not using Aero Service,” said Xstrata spokesman  James Rickards 
by phone from Sydney.  
 “It’s a plane that’s fairly commonly used in that part of
the world,” Paul Tyrell, the chief executive officer of the
Regional Aviation Association of Australia, said. “It has a
reputation as a robust, mid-range utility plane often used in
rougher areas. It certainly was on a mission for which it was
designed.”  
 Casa became part of European Aeronautic Defence & Space,
the parent of Airbus SAS, in 1999.
