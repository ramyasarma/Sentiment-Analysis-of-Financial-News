             Air China Ltd. , the world’s largest
airline by market value, surged to the highest in more than two
years in Hong Kong trading on speculation a stronger yuan will
boost outbound passenger traffic.  
 China’s largest international carrier jumped as much as 8.1
percent to HK$9.18, the highest intraday price since January
2008, after the central bank pledged on June 19 to implement a
more flexible currency-exchange rate regime. All three of
China’s biggest carriers jumped about 6 percent in Hong Kong
yesterday.  
 A stronger yuan, or renminbi, would make foreign holidays
cheaper for Chinese tourists, which could boost international
travel demand. Currency appreciation would also ease the cost of
dollar-denominated debts and fuel bills for Chinese airlines.  
 “Outbound traffic will increase if the renminbi
appreciates,” said  Kelvin Lau , equity analyst with Daiwa
Institute of Research in Hong Kong. “Air China will benefit
from that.”  
 The airline rose 1.7 percent to HK$8.63 at the 12:30 p.m.
lunch break.  China Southern Airlines Co. , the country’s largest
carrier by fleet size, fell 0.3 percent to HK$3.74 after rising
as much as 5.3 percent. China Eastern Airlines Corp., the
nation’s second-biggest airline by market capitalization, rose
1.6 percent to HK$3.80.
