             Magna International Inc. may say 
today that it’s backed by a majority of shareholders who have 
voted early on plans to pay founder Frank Stronach $863 million
in cash and shares to cede control, the Globe & Mail reported, 
citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  
 The company is due to defend the payout tomorrow before the
Ontario Securities Commission, which has described the 
transaction as unfair, the newspaper said.  
 More than 50 percent of Magna’s common shareholders have 
sent in their votes and of those, an “overwhelming majority” 
support the proposal, the Globe & Mail said.
