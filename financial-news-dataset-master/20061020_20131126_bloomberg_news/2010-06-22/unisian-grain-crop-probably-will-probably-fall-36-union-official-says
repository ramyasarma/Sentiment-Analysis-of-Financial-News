             Tunisia’s grain crop probably will
drop about 36 percent to 1.6 million metric tons this year
because of a decline in rainfall, an official at the country’s
Agriculture Union said.  
 “This year Tunisia will see a grain harvest that is weaker
than average,” Monji Cherif, a member of the union’s executive
office, said by phone yesterday. “It will not exceed 1.6
million tons.”  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 26 predicted a
40 percent drop in Tunisia’s wheat harvest to 1 million tons in
the marketing year that began June 1.  
 Farmers harvested 2.5 million tons of grain in 2009. The
North African country aims to reduce the rate of grain loss
during harvest to below 5 percent, Cherif said.
