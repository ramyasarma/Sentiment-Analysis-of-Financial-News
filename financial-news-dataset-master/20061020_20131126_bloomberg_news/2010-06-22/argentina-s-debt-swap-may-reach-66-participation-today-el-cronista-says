             Argentina’s debt restructuring may 
attract creditors holding 66 percent of the $18.3 billion in 
bonds left out of a 2005 offering, El Cronista reported, 
without saying where it obtained the information.  
 Holders of 62 percent of the debt had agreed to take part 
in the swap by June 18 and the level of acceptance has tripled 
since then to more than $300 million a day, the newspaper said.
The government hasn’t decided whether to extend the debt swap 
beyond today, El Cronista said.
