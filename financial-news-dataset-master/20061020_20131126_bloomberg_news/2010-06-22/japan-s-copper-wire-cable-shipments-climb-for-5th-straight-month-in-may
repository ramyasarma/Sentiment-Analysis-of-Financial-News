             Japan’s copper wire and cable
shipments climbed 11 percent in May from a year earlier, gaining
for the fifth straight month, as the country’s export-led
economy grew.  
 Shipments, including exports and domestic business,
increased to 49,700 metric tons last month, from 44,767 tons a
year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’
Association  said today in an e-mailed statement.
