             India’s 10-year  bonds  fell for a
second day on concern the  central bank  will raise interest rates
to contain inflation as economic growth gathers pace.  
 Yields rose to their highest level in a week before today’s
deadline for companies to pay license fees to the government for
providing high-speed wireless internet services. Operators may
have withdrawn as much as 385.4 billion rupees ($8.4 billion)
from banks, squeezing  cash availability  and increasing the cost
of funding for buying bonds.  
 “Now concerns about liquidity and resultant pressure on
money-market rates is out of the way and the attention is on the
rate move,” said J.  Moses Harding , a Mumbai-based executive
vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note
today.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose two
basis points to 7.59 percent as of 9:37 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.12, or 12 paise per 100-rupee face amount, to 101.46.  
 Harding said the  Reserve Bank of India  may raise its
benchmark interest  rates  by 25 basis points each at the end of
this month, and again at the July 27 policy meeting.  
 The central bank will raise rates in a “calibrated” way,
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on June 18.  
 The benchmark  wholesale-price index  advanced 10.16 percent
from a year earlier in May, after a 9.59 percent gain the
previous month. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee yesterday
forecast economic growth will accelerate to 8.5 percent in the
financial year ending March 31, from 7.4 percent last time, and
said the government is targeting expansion in the “double
digits.”  
 The central bank last raised policy rates at its April 20
policy meeting, the second increase this year. The Reserve
Bank’s benchmark reverse repurchase rate is 3.75 percent, and
the repurchase rate is 5.25 percent.
