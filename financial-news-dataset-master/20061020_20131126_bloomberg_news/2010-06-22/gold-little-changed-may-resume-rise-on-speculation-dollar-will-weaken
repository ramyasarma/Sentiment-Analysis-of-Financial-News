             Gold, little changed, may rebound
from the biggest loss in a month, on speculation that the dollar
will weaken and boost demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  
 The dollar fell after rising as much as 0.4 percent against
a basket of six major currencies. Yesterday, gold dropped 1.4
percent, after reaching an all-time high of $1,266.50 an ounce.
Before today, the metal gained 13 percent this year, partly on
demand for a haven from Europe’s sovereign-debt woes.  
 “Gold’s inverse relationship to the dollar is returning,”
said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset
Management. “It was an abnormality that gold was moving with
the dollar. Eventually, these market relationships revert to the
norm.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August slipped $2.10, or 0.2
percent, to $1,238.60 an ounce at 9:58 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, after rising as much as $1.20 or 0.1 percent.  
 Gold historically has moved inversely to the dollar. The
metal climbed to records in euros, sterling and Swiss francs
this month.  
 “You’re seeing the flight-to-quality fears out of Europe
subsiding and gold returning to its classic relationship to the
dollar,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  
 Silver futures for July delivery gained 2.1 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $18.875 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery lost $3.30, or 0.2
percent, to $1,596 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $6.75, or
1.4 percent, to $488.70 an ounce.
