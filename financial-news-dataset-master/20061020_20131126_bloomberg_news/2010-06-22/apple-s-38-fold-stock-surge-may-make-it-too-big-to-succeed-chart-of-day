             The 38-fold surge in Apple Inc.
shares that drove the iPhone seller past Microsoft Corp.’s
market value means the company may be “too big to succeed,”
according to research from  Rob Arnott .  
 Research Affiliates LLC found that since 1953, shares of
the biggest Standard & Poor’s 500 Index company in an industry
trailed the average stock by 2.4 percent a year in the next
decade. The CHART OF THE DAY shows the market value of Apple,
whose stock rallied to $270.17 yesterday from $7.17 at the end
of 2002, passed Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft’s in May
following the introduction of the iPad tablet computer.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has increased net
income seven straight years, following the release of the iPod
music player in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007. The IPad came out
in April, and Apple is forecast to report record profit of $12.4
billion in the fiscal year ending in September, according to the
average of 28 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “For investors, ‘top dog’ status is dismayingly
unattractive,” wrote Arnott, founder of Newport Beach,
California-based Research Affiliates, which oversees about $50
billion. “When you’re No. 1, you have a bright target painted on
your back. Competitors are gunning for you. Politicians and
pundits are gunning for you. Far from a problem of ‘too big to
fail,’ companies can become ‘too big to succeed.’”  
 Apple’s shares were worth $245.8 billion as of yesterday’s
close, compared with $227.4 billion for Microsoft. Apple trails
only Exxon Mobil Corp., which at $296.6 billion is the biggest
U.S. company.
