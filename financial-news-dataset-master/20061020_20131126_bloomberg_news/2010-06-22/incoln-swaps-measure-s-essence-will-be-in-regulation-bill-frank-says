             Senator  Blanche Lincoln ’s measure
requiring banks to push their swaps trading desks to separate
units will be in the final financial-regulation bill in some
form, Representative  Barney Frank  said today.  
 “The essence of how of what Senator Lincoln wanted to do
on pushing derivatives out of the banks will happen, and
certainly they will be totally insulated from any insured
deposits,” Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat leading House-
Senate negotiations on the legislation, told reporters during a
break in the talks.  
 Negotiators working to merge House and Senate versions of
the sweeping overhaul have been trying to reach a compromise on
the derivatives language, one of the most contentious issues.
The lawmakers are scheduled to consider the measure on June 24,
the date Frank has targeted for completing the conference
committee’s work.  
 Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who leads the Senate
Agriculture Committee, proposed separating swaps trading from
commercial banking. She has advocated for the rule in the face
of opposition from banks, lawmakers from both parties, and
regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman  Sheila Bair .  
 Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments based
on the value of another security or benchmark. Some instruments,
including contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have
been blamed for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst
recession since the Great Depression.
