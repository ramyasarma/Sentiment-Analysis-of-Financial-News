             South Korea plans to further tighten
a limit on foreign banks’ usage of currency derivatives, having
this month announced restrictions to curb volatility in capital
flows and the won that will take effect from July.  
 Rules announced June 13 will limit their positions in
foreign-exchange forwards, options and swaps to 250 percent of
equity capital, a goal that must be met within two years. That
ceiling will be “gradually” lowered, said Young Kim, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. Yonhap
Infomax earlier reported the plan, citing a senior finance
ministry official as saying the government plans to lower the
cap every three months.  
 “We have not set a timetable yet,” Kim said today in
Seoul. “The plan is to get banks to reduce their positions
gradually over a longer period of time.”  
 The limit for overseas banks will eventually be similar to
the 50 percent cap announced this month for domestic lenders,
Yonhap reported, citing  Kim Ik Joo , the ministry’s head of its
international finance bureau.  
 Financial regulators have found foreign banks to be
increasing their currency-derivatives positions before the new
restrictions take effect, Kim told Yonhap. The rules will from
July prohibit banks from increasing positions for three months
and allow two years for them to meet the announced ceilings.  
 The government has also detected traces of “double
booking,” where foreign banks record domestic forwards
transactions as deals with their headquarters. Yonhap cited Kim
Ik Joo as saying such banks will be penalized.
