             Carlos Beltran  will begin a
rehabilitation assignment this week and New York Mets general
manager  Omar Minaya  said he hopes the center fielder will be
able to make his season debut in mid-July.  
 Beltran, who has not played this season following right
knee surgery, will report to the Mets’ Class-A minor league team
in Port St. Lucie, Florida, on June 24.  
 Beltran, 33, a five-time All-Star, has a .283 batting
average -- with 273 home runs and 286 stolen bases -- in 12
Major League Baseball seasons with the Kansas City Royals,
Houston Astros and Mets.  
 “There’s not going to be a better hitter in any market to
be able to add than Carlos Beltran,” Minaya told reporters
tonight before the Mets’ game at Citi Field against the Detroit
Tigers.
