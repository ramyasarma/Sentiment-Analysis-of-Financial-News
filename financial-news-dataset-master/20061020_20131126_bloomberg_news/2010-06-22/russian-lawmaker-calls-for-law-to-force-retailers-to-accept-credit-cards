             Russia needs a law to encourage
 retailers  to accept credit cards and penalize those who don’t,
lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov told a conference in Moscow today.  
 “Many retail points, even large ones in Moscow, don’t
accept plastic cards,” Aksakov, a deputy at the State Duma,
Russia’s lower house of parliament, said without providing any
figures. “I see this as a violation of consumers’ rights. Even
a hundred-dollar bill prompts questions in America.”  
 Aksakov, who also heads the Russian Association of Regional
Banks, said he has just returned from New York, where he changed
his mind about paying for an Apple Corp. iPad with cash because
using a card was easier. Russia, with 142 million consumers,
also needs to encourage non-cash purchases with tax breaks for
retailers who accept cards or other benefits, Aksakov said.  
 Retail sales advanced for a fifth month, gaining an annual
5.1 percent in May, boosted by higher incomes, according to the
Federal Statistics Service. Real wages rose 7 percent and
disposable income gained 2.8 percent, the service said.  
 The Finance Ministry plans to draft and submit a law on the
national payment system, which includes provisions for
electronic payments, to the State Duma by September 1, Sergei
Barsukov, head of the Finance Ministry’s financial policy
department, said today.
