             Brazil’s Bovespa stock index
advanced for a second day, led by Vale SA, as metals prices
increased.  
 Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, climbed to the
highest price in a week, extending yesterday’s 2.9 percent gain.
Natura Cosmeticos SA, Brazil’s biggest cosmetics maker, rallied
2.4 percent, the steepest advance on the Bovespa index, after
Raymond James & Associates said the company’s sales strategy
will bolster profits.  
 The Bovespa added 0.2 percent to 64,943.16 at 9:40 a.m. New
York time. Forty-nine stocks rose on the index while 15 fell.
The real strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.7637 per dollar.
