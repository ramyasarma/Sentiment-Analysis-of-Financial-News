             Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  may be
the biggest beneficiary among Indian generic-drug makers as $157
billion of medicines including Eli Lilly & Co.’s Zyprexa lose
patent protection within five years, HDFC Securities Ltd. said.  
 Dr. Reddy’s has 73 applications awaiting approval with the
U.S.  Food and Drug Administration , said S. Rajan, a Dr. Reddy’s
spokesman. If approved, the Hyderabad-based company will be able
to supply generic versions of medications that generated about
$90 billion in U.S. sales in 2008, said  Ranjit Kapadia , an
analyst at HDFC in Mumbai.  
 Drugmakers are racing to develop cheaper alternatives to
brand-name medicines to meet demand from governments in
developed markets seeking to cut health-care costs and to tap
growth in emerging nations. Dr. Reddy’s is in an attractive
position to negotiate higher prices with U.S. drugstores because
it has a wide range of products covering diseases from diabetes
to Alzheimer’s, Kapadia said.  
 “The larger the basket, the better is the company’s
negotiating power,” Kapadia said in a telephone interview on
June 17. Dr. Reddy’s “has a huge pipeline, so it has got better
power,” said the analyst, who rates the stock “hold.”  
 Patents for at least 91 drugs, with combined annual revenue
of $157 billion in 2008, will expire from 2010 to 2015,
according to a report from HDFC on June 17. These include  Merck
& Co.’s  top-selling Singulair for treating asthma and Pfizer
Inc.’s Lipitor cholesterol pill, HDFC said.  
 Dr. Reddy’s  slipped 0.2 percent to 1,416.1 rupees as of
10:56 a.m. in Mumbai trading. India’s benchmark Sensitive index
declined 0.5 percent. The stock has gained 24 percent this year.  
 Infoline’s Projection  
 U.S. revenue at Indian pharmaceutical companies will rise
more than 20 percent annually over the next five years, helped
by drug patent expiries and greater use of generics, according
to India Infoline Ltd. President  Barack Obama ’s overhaul of the
U.S. health-care system will extend insurance to 47 million
Americans, most of whom “would be covered under low-end
policies -- an ideal market for generics,” Infoline said.  
 Indian drugmakers, which account for about 9 percent of the
U.S. generics industry, can expect “significant market share
gains” as they seek approval for more medicines and expand
their product range,  Bino Pathiparampil , a Mumbai-based analyst
at Infoline, wrote in a report yesterday. Annual sales of new
generics would be worth about $10 billion, 29 percent more than
the current market size.  
 The brokerage identified Dr. Reddy’s and  Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd.  as its top picks. “We believe these two will
have more earnings upsides that are yet to be priced into the
stocks,” the report said.  
 Dr. Reddy’s is the second-biggest Indian drugmaker by
revenue after  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.   
 Shares of  Sun Pharmaceutical , the largest Indian drugmaker
by market value, climbed 0.7 percent to 1,767.35 rupees in
Mumbai trading.
