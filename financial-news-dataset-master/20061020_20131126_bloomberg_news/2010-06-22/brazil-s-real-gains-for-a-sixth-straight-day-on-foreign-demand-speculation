             Brazil’s real fell for the first
time in six days as Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said the
government has the tools to limit gains in the currency.  
 The real dropped 0.6 percent to 1.7813 per dollar at 3:13
p.m. New York time, from 1.7712 yesterday.  
 “The general tone of the market is turning sour,” said
 Gerardo Margolis , vice president of emerging markets at TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto. “Mantega’s comment is hurting the
currency as well. The comments are more of the same as what they
said before, but the fact they are reiterating means that they
are serious about stopping the currency from gaining further.”  
 The currency has gained 2.2 percent this month, trimming
its loss this year to 2 percent. The Brazilian government will
seek to prevent the real’s appreciation, Mantega  said yesterday.  
 “We have tools to prevent that, but there will be
pressure,” Mantega told reporters in Brasilia.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.28 percent.
