             Poland’s Finance Ministry still 
estimates that the government’s budget deficit this year will 
be 10 billion zloty ($3.03 billion) to 15 billion zloty 
narrower than planned, Deputy Finance Minister Ludwik Kotecki 
was quoted today as saying by Dziennik Gazeta Prawna.  
 Extra spending for flood relief hasn’t changed the 
government’s budget forecasts and it is too soon to draw 
conclusions from stagnant budget revenue figures for the first 
five months of this year, as annual growth is distorted by the 
“base effect” of last year’s data, the newspaper cited 
Kotecki as saying.
