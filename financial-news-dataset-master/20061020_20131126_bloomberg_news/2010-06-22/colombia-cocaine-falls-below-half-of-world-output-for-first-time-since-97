             Colombia’s cocaine output fell to
less than half the world’s total last year, as Peru overtook the
country in cultivation of the drug’s base ingredient for the
first time in more than a decade.  
 Colombia last year produced 37 percent to 49 percent of the
estimated 842-to-1,111 metric tons of the world’s cocaine, down
from 51 percent in 2008, according to the 2010 World Drug Report
published by the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime .
Colombian output fell to 410 tons, from 450 tons in 2008,
Leonardo Correa, the project coordinator of the UN agency’s
Illicit Crop Monitoring Program in Colombia, said at a news
conference in Bogota to present the  report .  
 Peru overtook Colombia in potential production of coca, the
base ingredient of the drug, harvesting 119,000 tons of the leaf
compared with 103,100 tons for Colombia, according to the
report.  
 The last year Peru produced more coca than Colombia was in
1997, when Colombia’s total of world cocaine output stood at 40
percent. Coca yields in Peru were higher than Colombia last year
because the drug crops there did not face as much pressure from
eradication efforts, Correa said.  
 Land dedicated to production of coca in Colombia fell to
68,000 hectares (167,960 acres) last year, an 11-year low,
according to the study based on satellite monitoring. Coca
cultivation rose to 59,900 hectares in Peru from 56,100 a year
ago and to 30,900 in Bolivia from 30,500 in 2009.  
 Eradication  
 Colombian coca production has fallen due to U.S.-backed
aerial spraying of coca fields with herbicide, and a program of
“manual eradication” whereby workers dig up coca bushes by
hand. Colombia receives more than $600 million annually in U.S.
anti-narcotics aid, more than any country outside the Middle
East and Afghanistan.  
 Estimates for cocaine output in Peru and Bolivia are not
yet available, Correa said.  
 A kilogram of cocaine cost $2,147 in Colombia last year
compared with a wholesale price of $34,700 in the U.S. and
street price of $120,000, Correa said.  
 In Guaviare province in southern Colombia, the spraying and
eradication have caused an “economic crisis” said Giovanny
Gomez, a lawmaker for the Green Party in the state’s assembly.  
 The provincial capital, San Jose del Guaviare, is
struggling to cope with an increase in unemployment, informal
employment and squatter invasions as farmers affected by the
spraying move to the town, Gomez said.  
 “We welcome the help of the U.S., we welcome international
help, but this money needs to be used for crop substitution, not
fumigation,” Gomez said.  
 President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos  has pledged to continue
the government’s eradication programs, saying that the cocaine
trade is financing the country’s Marxist guerrillas.
