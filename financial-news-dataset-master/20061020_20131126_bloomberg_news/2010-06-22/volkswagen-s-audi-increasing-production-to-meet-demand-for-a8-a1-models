             Volkswagen AG ’s Audi luxury unit is
increasing production to meet higher demand for the A8 sedan and
new A1 compact, Chief Financial Officer  Axel Strotbek  said.  
 “A global recovery for Audi is under way,” Strotbek said
at a briefing in Berlin late yesterday. China’s “domestic
engine keeps running and is now bringing a boom to the rest of
the world that certainly offsets the crisis in part.”  
 Audi is adding Saturday shifts at its plant in Neckarsulm,
Germany, to meet demand for the new version of the A8, while
sales of the new A1 may exceed a planned annual target of
100,000 vehicles, the CFO said.  
 Ingolstadt, Germany-based Audi has a goal of dethroning
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  as the world’s largest maker of
luxury cars by 2015. Strotbek reiterated a goal of exceeding 1
million deliveries in 2010, saying the level will be surpassed
“not insignificantly.” Audi’s sales in 2009 fell 5.4 percent
to 949,729 units from 1 million in 2008.  
 Audi  will post “above-average growth” in results this
year, Strotbek reiterated. Audi will roll out as many as 12
models and upgrades in 2010, including a coupe dubbed the A7.  
 The Chinese central bank’s decision of June 19 to end the
yuan’s two-year-old peg to the dollar will provide a “small
relief” to Audi’s China-based joint venture, enabling the unit
to import parts at lower costs, the CFO said.  
 “Our products in China will become cheaper” if the yuan
is allowed to appreciate, Strotbek said. “It will have a
positive rather than negative effect.”
