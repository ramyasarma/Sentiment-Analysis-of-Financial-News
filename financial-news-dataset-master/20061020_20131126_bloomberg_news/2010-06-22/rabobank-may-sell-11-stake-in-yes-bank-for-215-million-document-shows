             Rabobank Groep  sold an 11 percent
stake in India’s  Yes Bank Ltd.  for about 9.81 billion rupees
($213 million) to meet regulatory requirements as it seeks a
full banking license in the South Asian nation.  
 Rabobank sold about 37.3 million shares for 263 rupees each,
according to Bloomberg data. That’s at the lower range of its
offer to sell the stake for as much as 270 rupees, a sale
document obtained by Bloomberg News showed. Citigroup Inc.
managed the transaction.  
 Rabobank aims to set up its own banking unit in India
following 12 years of operations in Asia’s third-largest economy.
Shares of Yes Bank have more than doubled since a lock-up period
for 40 million shares bought by the Dutch lender before the 2005
IPO expired in May 2009, according to the  prospectus .  
 “Rabobank is keen to participate and contribute to India’s
further growth,” the Utrecht, Netherlands-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. “To this end, Rabobank is keen to
establish its own banking presence in India and has sought the
necessary regulatory approvals.”  
 Shares of Yes Bank  fell as much as 6.7 percent, its
steepest intraday decline in more than a month, before closing
at 271.85 rupees, down 3.5 percent, in Mumbai today.  
 Rabobank plans to keep a 4.9 percent stake in the bank, it
said today. The Dutch company was Yes Bank’s largest stakeholder,
with 54 million shares, or a 15.9 percent stake, as of March 31,
according to the Indian lender’s website.  
 Rabobank’s Stake  
 The buyers of Rabobank’s stake include Birla Mutual Fund,
Life Insurance Corp. of India, Citigroup Global Markets
Mauritius Pvt. and DSP Merrill Lynch Mutual Fund, according to
data on the Bombay Stock Exchange’s website.  
 Life Insurance, the nation’s largest money manager, bought
6.25 million shares, while Birla and DSP acquired 5 million
shares each and Citigroup purchased 3.06 million shares, the
data showed.  
 The Dutch lender planned to sell a 10 percent stake because
it aims to set up its own banking operations, the Economic Times
reported earlier today.  
 Rabobank, which in 2002 won approval to set up banking
operations through a joint venture in India, was among investors
that provided a  capital infusion  to the Indian lender in March
2004, paying about 400 million rupees for a 20 percent stake.  
 Yes Bank received a license to begin banking operations
from the Reserve Bank of India in May 2004, and sold shares in a
3.15 billion rupee initial public offering in June 2005.  
 Yes Bank  ranks No. 11  among lenders in India by market-
capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The Indian lender, which has 150 branches nationwide, plans
to add another 100 outlets within the next one year and aims to
reach 750 branches by 2015, it said on June 12. That compares
with the more than 12,400 branches for State Bank of India, the
nation’s largest, and over 2,000 outlets at ICICI Bank Ltd., the
second-largest.
