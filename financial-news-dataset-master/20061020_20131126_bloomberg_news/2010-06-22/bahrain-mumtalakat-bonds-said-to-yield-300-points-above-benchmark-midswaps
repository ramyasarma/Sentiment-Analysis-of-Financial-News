             Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co., the
Persian Gulf country’s sovereign wealth fund, may price its
bonds to yield about 300 basis points above benchmark midswaps,
three people familiar with the pricing range said.  
 The banker and two investors declined to be identified
because terms of the deal aren’t set. The fund may sell $500
million of bonds maturing in five years as soon as this week in
its first sale of debt overseas, a person familiar with the plan
said last week.  
 Bahrain in March sold $1.25 billion bonds maturing in 2020
to yield 200 basis points more than similar maturity U.S.
Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The yield
has declined 11 basis points this month to 5.552 percent as of
4:50 p.m. in Dubai, according to Bloomberg bond trader composite
prices.  
 The sale will be the first from Bahrain, the smallest oil
producer among Gulf Arab states, since March. Issuers from the
Middle East raised $10.7 billion from debt sales so far this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg data. That
compares to $16 billion in the same period last year.  
 Mumtalakat, established in July 2006, holds stakes in more
than 35 companies and had assets of 3.4 billion dinars ($10
billion) as of Dec. 31, according to its website. Mumtalakat
will have a long-term rating of A at Standard & Poor’s, the
sixth-highest investment grade rankings, S&P said last week. The
fund has about $1 billion of bank loans outstanding, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.
