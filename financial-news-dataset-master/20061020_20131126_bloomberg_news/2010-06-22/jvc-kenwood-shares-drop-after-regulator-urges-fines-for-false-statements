             JVC Kenwood Holdings Inc.  fell to
its lowest in almost a month in Tokyo trading after Japan’s
securities watchdog recommended fining the company and its
Victor unit for falsifying financial statements.  
 The  shares  dropped 5 percent to 38 yen, their lowest
since May 28 on a closing basis, as of 9:57 a.m., local time.
The stock has lost 12 percent this year, compared with a 3.9
percent decline the benchmark  Nikkei 225  Stock Average.  
 JVC faces as much as 839.1 million yen ($9.2 million) in
fines, while Victor may be fined as much as 707.6 million yen,
the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission said
yesterday in a statement on its website.
