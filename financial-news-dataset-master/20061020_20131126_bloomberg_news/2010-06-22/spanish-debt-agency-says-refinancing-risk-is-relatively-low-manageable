             Spain’s refinancing risk is
“relatively low, compared to peers,” and “manageable,” the
nation’s debt agency said in a presentation on its  website .  
 The nation’s average funding cost for outstanding debt was
3.53 percent as of May 31, matching a record low, it said in the
presentation.  
 The agency is lengthening the average life of its debt,
“even if it entails higher cost,” it said.
