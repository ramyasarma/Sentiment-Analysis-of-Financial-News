             French Labor Minister  Eric Woerth 
said his wife is stepping down from her job managing assets for
 L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt , whose alleged tax
irregularities have kicked up a political storm in the country.  
 Florence Woerth worked in a company that handled the
dividends received by Bettencourt, France’s richest woman.
Transcripts of an alleged conversation by Bettencourt, taped
secretly by her butler and published on the website of
 Mediapart , suggested that the heiress was planning on evading
taxes, the news service said. Woerth today said his wife was
unaware of any alleged tax irregularities.  
 “She’s quitting because it’s become untenable,” he said
in an interview with BFM television. “She has nothing to
reproach herself for. There’s no way my wife could have known
about all these accounts they are talking about because they
would have been handled elsewhere. There is no way any tax fraud
took place within the structure where my wife worked.”  
 Woerth, who previously was budget minister and led a
crackdown on tax evasion, said he didn’t know about
Bettencourt’s tax situation.  
 “It may surprise you, but the budget minister doesn’t
decide on tax audits,” Woerth said. “We live in a modern
republic, and our revenue service knows how to do its job.”  
 In the Mediapart transcript, Bettencourt is alleged to have
funnelled 80 million euros ($99 million) in undeclared funds to
Swiss accounts.  
 The opposition Socialist Party has asked for Woerth’s
resignation.
