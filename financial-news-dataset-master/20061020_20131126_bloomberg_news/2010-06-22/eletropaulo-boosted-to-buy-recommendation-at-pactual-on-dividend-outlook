             Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA, the
Brazilian unit of AES Corp., was raised to “buy” from
“neutral” at Banco BTG Pactual SA, which said the company is
attractive based on its dividend.  
 Pactual also raised Light SA, a Brazilian electricity
distributor, to “buy” from “neutral” and boosted Companhia
Energetica de Sao Paulo, the state-controlled power company
known as Cesp, to “neutral” from “sell.”
