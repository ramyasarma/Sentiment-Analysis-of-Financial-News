             Ontario Judge Sarah Pepall called a
dispute over a C$2 billion sale of Canwest Global Communications
Corp.’s television assets to Shaw Communications Inc.
“ridiculous,” and ordered lawyers involved to resolve it
outside court. Pepall adjourned a scheduled hearing today for
approval of the sale in Toronto.
