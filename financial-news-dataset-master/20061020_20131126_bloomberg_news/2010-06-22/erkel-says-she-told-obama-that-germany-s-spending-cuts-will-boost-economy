             Chancellor Angela Merkel said that
Germany’s 80 billion-euro savings program won’t put a brake on
global growth.  
 Merkel, in a speech in Berlin today, said that she told
President Barack Obama in a phone call late yesterday that
reducing the budget deficit is key for Germany and will make
Germans more likely to spend.
