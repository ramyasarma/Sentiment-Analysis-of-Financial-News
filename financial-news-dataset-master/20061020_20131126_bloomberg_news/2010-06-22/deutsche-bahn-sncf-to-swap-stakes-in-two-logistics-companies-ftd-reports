             Deutsche Bahn AG  and Societe
Nationale de Chemins de Fer plan to swap stakes in two logistics
companies to unwind cross-shareholdings, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing unidentified people at the German
railway operator.  
 Deutsche Bahn will take SNCF’s 20 percent share of Spanish
logistics company Transportes Ferroviarios Especiales SA,
increasing its holding to 75 percent, FTD said. In return, SNCF
will get 10 percent in the auto distributer STVA SA, in which
SNCF owns a majority, according to the report.  
 The stakes are each valued at 24 million euros, FTD said.
