             Intel Corp.  and the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission filed a motion to suspend trial proceedings
while the two work on a potential settlement of the government’s
antitrust case against the chipmaker.  
 Under the motion, the two parties would have until July 22
to discuss an agreement, the Santa Clara, California-based
company said today in a statement.  
 The FTC sued  Intel  in December, accusing it of illegally
using its dominant market position for a decade to “stifle
competition and strengthen its monopoly.” The suit was filed
after Intel settled a civil case with rival  Advanced Micro
Devices Inc.  and was fined by the European Union.  
 “This was a huge distraction for them,” said  Krishna Shankar , an analyst at ThinkEquity LLC in San Francisco. He
recommends buying Intel shares. “You never know how these
trials will go.”  
 Intel accounts for more than 80 percent of global computer-
processor sales -- dwarfing  AMD , its nearest competitor. The
November settlement with AMD cost Intel $1.25 billion. That
followed a record EU fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion
at the time).  
 Nvidia Dispute  
 Part of the FTC investigation concerned Intel’s legal
dispute with graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp., according to
people familiar with the matter.  
 “We remain hopeful that any settlement will recognize
Intel’s history of impeding competition and innovation at the
expense of the American consumer,”  Hector Marinez , a spokesman
for Santa Clara-based Nvidia, said in an e-mail.  
 Tom Beermann , a spokesman for Intel, declined to comment
beyond the statement.  Mitchell Katz , an FTC spokesman, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment.  
 A possible settlement of the FTC case may force Intel to
come to an agreement with Nvidia, Shankar said.  
 Intel, the world’s largest computer-chip maker, fell
21 cents to $21.19 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The  shares  have gained 3.9 percent this year.
