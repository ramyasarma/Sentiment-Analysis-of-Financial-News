             Germany will need to borrow 60
billion euros ($74 billion) to finance its budget this year,
less than the 80 billion euros originally projected,  Bild 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The economic recovery means tax revenues are higher than
anticipated, reducing the debt need, the newspaper said.
