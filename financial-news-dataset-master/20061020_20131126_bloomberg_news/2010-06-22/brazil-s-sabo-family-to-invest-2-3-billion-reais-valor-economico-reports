             Claudio Roberto Sabo, whose family
owns a Brazilian auto-parts company, founded WWI World Wide
Investments, which has 2.3 billion reais ($1.3 billion) to
invest, Valor Economico reported.  
 WWI will invest 1 billion reais in the real-estate industry
and the rest in biofuel, biomass, energy and forests, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information. Sabo set up the company with Marco Versiani, who
previously worked for Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Caixa
Economica Federal, Valor said.
