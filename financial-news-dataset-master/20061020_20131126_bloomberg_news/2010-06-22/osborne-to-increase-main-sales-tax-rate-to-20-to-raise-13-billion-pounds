             Chancellor of the Exchequer George
Osborne said in his emergency budget in Parliament in London
today that the main rate of sales tax will rise to 20 percent
from 17.5 percent on Jan. 4.  
 “The years of debt and spending make this unavoidable,”
he said. “This single tax measure will by the end of this
Parliament generate over 13 billion pounds a year of extra
revenues. That is 13 billion pounds we don’t have to find from
extra spending cuts or income tax rises.”
