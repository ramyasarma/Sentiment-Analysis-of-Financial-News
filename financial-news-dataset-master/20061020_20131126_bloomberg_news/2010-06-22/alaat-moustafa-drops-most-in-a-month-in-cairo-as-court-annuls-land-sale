             Talaat Moustafa Group Holding , the
biggest publicly traded real-estate company in Egypt, tumbled
the most in a month as a court annulled a land sale for the
company’s Madinaty project.  
 The shares declined 7.5 percent, the most since May 25, to
7.58 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo, valuing the company
at 15.4 billion pounds ($2.7 billion). The stock exchange
canceled all trades made before the company’s regulatory filing
on the matter.  
 “Investors don’t know how big or how significant the news
is and are just dumping the shares in panic without digesting,”
said  Ashraf Akhnoukh , a senior equity trader at CIBC brokerage
in Cairo.  
 Talaat Moustafa said a private individual filed the case
against the state-run New Urban Communities Authority, which
sold it the land. Talaat Moustafa is not directly involved, it
said. The court ruled the New Urban Communities did not abide by
a bidding law that applies to the sale of public assets by
government agencies. The New Urban Communities Authority will
appeal the ruling, the Cairo-based Talaat Moustafa said.
