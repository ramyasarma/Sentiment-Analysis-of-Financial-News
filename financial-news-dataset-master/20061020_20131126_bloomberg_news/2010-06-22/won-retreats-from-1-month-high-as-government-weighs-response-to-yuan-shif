             South Korea’s won fell, retreating
from a one-month high, on speculation policy makers will seek to
limit currency appreciation after China scrapped a two-year peg
to the dollar.  
 Finance Minister  Yoon Jeung Hyun  told lawmakers yesterday
that the government and central bank are preparing measures to
cope with the expected rise in the yuan and are analyzing the
economic impact. The won yesterday jumped 2.6 percent, building
on a 3.6 percent advance last week, as China let its currency
gain 0.4 percent, the most since a July 2005 revaluation.  
 “The market is under pressure because the won rose so much
in such a short period of time,” said  Ko Kyu Youn , a currency
dealer at Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul. “But it’s too early to
say the effects of China’s yuan appreciation have faded out.
It’s still a dollar-sell atmosphere.”  
 The won dropped 0.9 percent to close at 1,182.00 per dollar
in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yuan fell
0.3 percent, the most since December 2008.  
 Central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said yesterday that a
rise in China’s yuan may spur an appreciation of the won,
potentially creating difficulties for export-driven South Korea.
Ko said there’s a risk the Bank of Korea will intervene to check
appreciation.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said South Korea’s won may
strengthen to 1,100 per dollar, according to a research report
e-mailed yesterday. The report said pickups in economic growth
and inflation, along with a stronger yuan, will make policy
makers “more tolerant” of currency gains.  
 More Derivative Caps  
 South Korea plans to further tighten a limit on foreign
banks’ usage of currency derivatives, having this month
announced restrictions to curb volatility in capital flows and
the won that will take effect from July.  
 Rules announced June 13 will limit their positions in
foreign-exchange forwards, options and swaps to 250 percent of
equity capital, a goal that must be met within two years. That
ceiling will be “gradually” lowered, said Young Kim, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.  
 Yonhap Infomax earlier reported the plan, citing a senior
finance ministry official as saying the government plans to
lower the cap every three months.  
 “Domestic measures like the currency forward regulations
are also a factor that is pushing the won lower compared to its
Asian peers,” Ko said.  
 The government’s benchmark three-year bonds fell for a
second day. The yield on the 3.75 percent note due June 2013
rose four basis points to 3.89 percent, the highest level for a
benchmark three-year note since March, according to Korea Stock
Exchange.
