             Dubai shares declined for the first
time in four days as index provider MSCI Inc. kept the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar as frontier markets, citing the
countries’ dual account structures.  
 Dubai Islamic Bank , the U.A.E.’s largest Islamic bank,
retreated 1.9 percent and  Emaar Properties PJSC , builder of the
world’s tallest skyscraper, decreased 3.2 percent. The  DFM
General Index  fell 1.7 percent, the most since June 15, to
1,536.22 as of 10:50 a.m. in the emirate. The measure had gained
5.1 percent in the previous three days. Abu Dhabi’s gauge
dropped 0.5 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index , which tracks
200 equities in the region, slid 0.4 percent.  
 The MSCI decision not to upgrade the U.A.E. and Qatar to
emerging markets could cause “some weakness as a few investors
had put on ‘just in case’ positions over the past two days,”
 Julian Bruce , director of equity sales at EFG-Hermes Holding
SAE, said before trading began. “After three positive days,
some profit-taking had to be expected.”  
 The U.A.E. and Qatar will remain under review for a
potential reclassification to emerging markets, the index
provider said. “The need to set up and operate with a dual
account structure is still a major concern to a number of
international institutional investors and is incompatible with
general emerging markets standards,” MSCI said in reference to
the U.A.E.  
 Dubai Islamic Bank slid for the first time in four days to
2.02 dirhams. Emaar retreated the most since June 15 to 3.28
dirhams.  
 Kuwait’s benchmark decreased 0.4 percent, Oman’s  MSM30
Index  dropped 0.6 percent and Bahrain’s gauge fell 0.1 percent. 
Qatar’s stock  market  hasn’t opened.
