             Poland’s government supports state-
controlled  PKO Bank Polski SA ’s bid to buy a majority stake in
Bank Zachodni WBK SA from Allied Irish Banks Plc.  
 The government will move to adjourn PKO’s shareholder
meeting this week, delaying a decision on a  dividend  until it’s
clear what chance the country’s largest lender has of buying
Zachodni, Treasury Minister  Aleksander Grad  told reporters in
Warsaw today.  
 Allied Irish is selling a 70 percent stake in Zachodni,
Poland’s third-biggest bank by market value, to help meet
capital requirements set by Irish banking regulators. About two-
thirds of Poland’s banks are controlled by foreign investors.  
 “From a strictly business point of view, in the long term
it makes sense” as it would cement PKO’s market “dominance,”
said  Marek Juras , head of equity research at UniCredit CAIB
Poland. “It also carries a very high risk, since the bank
doesn’t have experience in carrying out such a transaction.”  
 PKO fell 0.5 percent to 37.58 zloty as of 1:17 p.m. in
Warsaw trading. Zachodni gained 0.5 percent to 199.9 zloty,
increasing its market value to 14.6 billion zloty ($4.4
billion).  
 PKO “welcomes shareholders support” for expansion, Chief
Executive Officer  Zbigniew Jagiello  said in an e-mail. “We want
to be an unquestioned leader in the Polish banking sector and
that is why we are carefully looking at the market.”
