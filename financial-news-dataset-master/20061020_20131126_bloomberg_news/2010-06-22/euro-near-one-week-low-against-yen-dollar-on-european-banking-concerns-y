             The yen traded near a one-week high
versus the euro amid concern weakness in Europe’s manufacturing
sector and the U.S. housing market will hamper the global
recovery, triggering demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 The yen gained against 15 of its 16 most-active
counterparts before reports today forecast to show European
services and manufacturing industries slowed and new U.S. home
sales slid by the most in 16 years. The dollar traded near a
four-week low versus the yen on speculation the Federal Reserve
will today express concern over the U.S. economy. Malaysia’s
ringgit led Asian currencies lower as Asian stocks declined.  
 “The yen is a beneficiary of sentiment,” said  Adam Carr ,
a senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “There is
a view, which I believe is incorrect, that it is a safe-haven
currency.”  
 Japan’s currency traded at 110.88 per euro at 6:56 a.m. in
London from 111.14 in New York yesterday, after earlier gaining
to 110.78, matching the June 14 high. The dollar was at 90.42
yen from 90.57 yen. The euro traded at $1.2263 from $1.2271
yesterday, after reaching $1.2245, the weakest since June 17.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares fell 1.2
percent and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 1.9 percent. The
ringgit fell 0.7 percent to 3.2300 per dollar.  
 European, U.S. Data  
 London-based Markit Economics will say today its composite
index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing managers in
services and manufacturing industries fell to 55.8 in June from
56.4 in May, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  
 The Commerce Department will say U.S. sales of new homes,
tabulated on contract signings, fell 19 percent to an annual
pace of 410,000 in May, a separate survey showed. The projected
drop would be the biggest since January 1994. Existing home
sales fell 2.2 percent in May, data by the National Association
of Realtors showed yesterday.  
 The yen typically strengthens in times of financial
turmoil as Japan’s trade surplus makes the currency attractive
as it means the nation doesn’t have to rely on overseas lenders.  
 The dollar is set for a second daily decline against the
yen before the Federal Open Market Committee ends a two-day
meeting and releases a policy statement today. Policy makers
will hold the benchmark rate at the record low range of zero to
0.25 percent today, a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 “The focus should be on the statement’s assessment for
the U.S. economy, given the latest drag on U.S. equities by
disappointing U.S. residential property data,”  Philip Wee , a
senior currency economist in Singapore at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd., wrote in a research note today.  
 The Standard & Poor’s  500 Index  slipped 1.6 percent and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 percent yesterday.  
 European Banks  
 The euro also fell after Credit Agricole SA said it will
take a 400 million euro ($491 million) writedown on its stake
in Emporiki Bank of Greece SA. Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services said in a report on June 21 that  Spanish banks  face
“difficult years” in 2010 and 2011 as credit losses mount and
revenue generation comes under “substantial strain.”  
 “A wealth of worrying credit news is rekindling fears
over the health of the European banking sector,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in
Wellington. “This is weighing on the euro.”  
 The British pound rose to a one-week high against the euro
after U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  won the endorsement of
bond investors and Fitch Ratings for the biggest budget squeeze
in 50 years.  
 Fitch on Britain  
 Fitch, which said June 8 the U.K. faced a “formidable”
fiscal challenge, yesterday said the “ambitious” plan ensured
Britain would keep its AAA credit rating. The deficit cuts
planned by Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  and
measures proposed by the previous Labour government total 113
billion pounds ($167.5 billion), 15 percent of the 737 billion-
pound budget foreseen for 2015, the Treasury said.  
 “The pound was one of the first hit by quantitative
monetary and expansionary fiscal policies that evoked the ire
of rating agencies,”  Greg Gibbs , a foreign-exchange strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney, wrote in a
research note today. “The pound is expected to continue to
outperform the euro and yen.”  
 The U.K. currency advanced to 82.69 pence per euro from
82.83 pence yesterday, after earlier rising to 82.68 pence, the
strongest since June 15. It was at $1.4827 from $1.4816
yesterday.
