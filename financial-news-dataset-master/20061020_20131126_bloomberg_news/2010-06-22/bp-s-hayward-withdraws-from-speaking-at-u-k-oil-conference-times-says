             BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Tony 
Hayward has withdrawn from a speech he was to deliver today at 
at a London oil conference, the London-based Times reported, 
citing the company, which attributed the decision to 
commitments related to “Gulf of Mexico activities.”       
 Hayward was a target of criticism because of his 
participation in a yacht race on the weekend, the newspaper 
said. The CEO is reported to be planning to meet Dmitry 
Medvedev in Russia this week to reassure the Russian president 
that BP, which owns stakes in two of the country’s biggest oil 
companies, remains strong, the Times said, without attribution.
