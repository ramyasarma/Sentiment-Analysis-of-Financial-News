             Fairfax Media Ltd. , Australia’s
second-largest newspaper publisher, is the nation’s most shorted
stock with more than 271 million positions reported by the
country’s corporate regulator.  
 The number of short positions represents more than 11
percent of Fairfax shares on June 16, more than double the 5
percent of second-ranked  Perpetual Ltd. , the  Australian
Securities and Investments Commission  said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Short sellers borrow assets such as shares and sell them,
betting the price will fall. They plan to buy them later and
pocket the difference.  
 The Australian regulator began reporting of short positions
yesterday.
