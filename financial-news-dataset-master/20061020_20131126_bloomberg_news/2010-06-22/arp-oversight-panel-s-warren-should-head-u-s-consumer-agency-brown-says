             Elizabeth Warren , who leads the
congressional panel overseeing the government’s rescue of
financial firms, should be picked by President  Barack Obama  to
head a new consumer financial agency, Democratic Senator  Sherrod Brown  said.  
 “I would love to see the president appoint Elizabeth
Warren,” Brown of Ohio said in an interview today at
Bloomberg’s Washington office. “I don’t have any idea if that
would happen. I know a lot of people who would not love to see
the president appoint Elizabeth Warren.”  
 Warren, who is on leave from her post as a professor at
Harvard Law School, is a best-selling author and expert on
bankruptcy and credit. Her panel has criticized actions in 2008
by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to bail out banks and
insurance company  American International Group Inc .  
 Democrats defeated Republican efforts today to scale back
the powers of the proposed consumer financial protection bureau,
which would be housed at the Fed. The bureau would have the
power to write and enforce rules banning abusive practices in
credit-card and mortgage lending.  
 While he had supported making the panel “fully
independent,” Brown said its being based at the Fed “wasn’t a
major problem” because of the independent authority given it in
a bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee.  
 Important Appointment  
 “Whom the president appoints will indicate something about
how aggressive this agency will be,” Brown said. “The first
appointment is pretty important.”  
 Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  defended the
government’s management of the $700 billion Troubled Asset
Relief Program in testimony before Warren’s panel today.  
 Warren, 61, has also called for regulations to limit
credit-card contracts to a short, easy-to-read document, curb
bank overdraft fees and make online credit scores free.  
 “Credit cards are like snakes: Handle ‘em long enough and
one will bite you,” she said in an interview last year. “You
have to remember what are incomes to banks are outgoes to
families.”  
 Last year,  Wayne Abernathy , an executive vice president of
the American Bankers Association in Washington, called Warren
“a very strong banking critic.”
