             Hong Kong stocks  fell for the first
time in 10 days after Fitch Ratings cut its rating on BNP
Paribas SA, heightening concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening, countering gains in commodity producers.
       Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. , the world’s biggest
contract maker of mobile phones, slid 3 percent. HSBC Holdings
Plc, Europe’s No. 1 bank by market value, declined 1 percent
after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services forecast difficult
years for Spanish banks. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
nation’s biggest producer of the metal, rose 1.5 percent.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.5 percent to close at
20,819.08, after climbing as much as 0.2 percent. The gauge
advanced 7.9 percent in the previous nine days. The benchmark
index surged 3.1 percent yesterday after China allowed the yuan
to appreciate against the U.S. dollar.  
 “We’re due for consolidation before a second wave of the
rally,” said  Castor Pang , Cinda International Ltd’s research
director in Hong Kong. “Yuan speculation is more of an excuse
rather than serving as a real support.”  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of Chinese companies’
so-called H-shares fell 0.6 percent to 12,061.34.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  has dropped 4.8 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and credit tightening by
China dented confidence in the strength of the global economy.  
 Shares on the benchmark index are priced at an average  13.7
times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, the
highest level in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
      Foxconn  slid 3 percent to HK$5.76. HSBC declined 1 percent
to HK$75.70. Esprit Holdings Ltd., which got 85 percent of its
fiscal 2009 revenue from Europe, fell 3.2 percent to HK$45.10.  
 Europe Ratings Cuts  
 Fitch cut its long-term credit rating on BNP Paribas,
France’s largest bank, citing a “deterioration” of the
company’s asset quality. The report came as Standard & Poor’s
slashed its economic growth forecast for Spain to an average of
0.7 percent a year through 2016 from 1 percent, saying Spanish
banks face mounting credit losses and “substantial strain” on
revenue generation.  
 Aluminum Corp., also known as Chalco, rose 1.5 percent to
HK$6.64. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the
metal, gained 0.6 percent to HK$15.94, extending yesterday’s 7.2
percent jump.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
aluminum advanced 2.2 percent yesterday, halting three days of
declines.  
 China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. , controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, dropped 1.7 percent to HK$16.32.
 China Resources Land Ltd. , a state-controlled developer,
declined 2.1 percent to HK$15.96.  
 China Real Estate  
 Real estate prices in larger Chinese cities are poised to
steadily decline as government measures start to take effect,
the National Development and Reform Commission said in a report
relating to 36 large and medium-sized cities. It didn’t name the
cities.  
 Tencent Holdings Ltd., a provider of Internet value-added
services, slid 4.7 percent to HK$126 after China’s Ministry of
Culture said it ordered a ban on Internet game operators
offering virtual-currency services to minors.  
 Lee & Man Paper Manufacturing Ltd. , the ninth best
performer this year on the  Bloomberg World Forest Products &
Paper Index , retreated 3.9 percent to HK$6.43. The company said
its controlling shareholder, Gold Best Holdings Ltd., agreed to
sell a 12 percent stake to Nippon Paper Group Inc. for HK$3.55
billion ($457 million).  
 June futures on the Hang Seng Index declined 0.6 percent to
20,839. Twenty-five stocks dropped while 16 rose among the
measure’s 43 constituents.
