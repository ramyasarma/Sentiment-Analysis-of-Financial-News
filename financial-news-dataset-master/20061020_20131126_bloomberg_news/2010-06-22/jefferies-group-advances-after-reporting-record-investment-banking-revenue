             Jefferies Group Inc. , the New York-
based securities firm that specializes in mid-sized companies,
rose the most in nine months in New York trading after reporting
record  investment-banking  revenue and a sixth-straight quarter
of rising profit.  
 Jefferies climbed $1.30, or 5.7 percent, to $24.17 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
increase since September, after  gaining  as much as 10.1 percent.
The stock, which jumped 69 percent in 2009, has  risen  1.9
percent this year.  
 Jefferies, led by Chief Executive Officer  Rich Handler , has
increased its headcount by more than 25 percent since 2008,
taking advantage of the collapse of larger investment banks.
Investment-banking  revenue  more than doubled to $256 million
from $120.8 million a year earlier.  
 “We are pleased with these solid quarterly results, as
they were achieved during a volatile operating environment,”
Handler said in a statement. He said on a conference call with
analysts that May’s environment was “choppy at best.”  
 Net income was $84.8 million, or 41 cents a share, for the
three months ended May 31, compared with $61.9 million, or 30
cents, for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the company said
today in the statement. Jefferies was expected to report a
profit of 34 cents, the average of seven analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  
 “Our industry is clearly in a cyclical upturn in
investment banking coming from almost a standing start in
2008,” Handler said in an interview. “The competitive
landscape has changed with a number of people gone, though
there’s always competition. Becoming a primary dealer, having a
transparent balance sheet and being a truly client-focused firm
have put us in a position where we are gaining market share.”  
 The firm announced earlier this year that it would change
its fiscal year-end to Nov. 30, so March results were included
in first-quarter and second-quarter earnings.  
 Fixed Income  
 Revenue  climbed 13 percent from the second quarter of 2009
to $669.5 million. Fixed-income sales and trading revenue fell
33 percent to $230.9 million, while equities revenue climbed 37
percent to $168.7 million.  
 The firm set aside $384.3 million, or 57 percent of net
revenue, for compensation and benefits.  
 Jefferies is the 22nd-ranked adviser on announced mergers
and acquisitions this year, working on 40 deals valued at more
than $15.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
firm is the 12th-ranked underwriter for U.S. equity offerings,
Bloomberg data show.  
 Book value per share was $13.33 on May 31, down from $13.48
as of March 31.  
 “The decline in book value is the key takeaway in our
view,” Ticonderoga Securities analyst  Doug Sipkin , who rates
the shares “sell,” said in a note to investors. “Book value
only measures the April-May period, suggesting that the
challenging operating environment had more of an impact than EPS
would suggest.”  
 Jefferies decided earlier this year to resume paying a
 dividend  after almost two years without one.
