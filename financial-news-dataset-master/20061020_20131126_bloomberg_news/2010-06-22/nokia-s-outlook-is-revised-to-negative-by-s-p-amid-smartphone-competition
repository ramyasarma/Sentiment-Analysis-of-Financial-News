             Nokia Oyj , the world’s biggest maker
of mobile phones, may have its credit rating cut by Standard &
Poor’s as handset margins decline amid mounting competition from
 Apple Inc. ’s iPhone.  
 S&P lowered its outlook to “negative” from “stable,”
citing Nokia’s “rather weak competitive position in
smartphones.” It affirmed its long-term rating of “A,” the
sixth out of the 10 investment-grade ratings by the agency. The
rating, which Nokia has had since June 1998, may be cut if
margins don’t improve from the fourth quarter, S&P said.  
 “The negative outlook reflects a material deterioration of
the historically industry-leading margins of Nokia’s Devices &
Services segment, a negative trend which began at the end of
2008 just after the onset of the recent global economic
downturn,” said S&P analyst  Matthias Raab .  
 Nokia last week cut its full-year growth forecasts, saying
full-year margins in its main handset operations could fall
below its forecast of 11 to 13 percent. The business had margins
of 12.5 percent last year and 18.2 percent in 2008. Nokia has
struggled to deliver a touchscreen device that meets user
expectations raised by the iPhone.  
 Nokia shares  fell as much as 25 cents, or 3.5 percent, to
6.88 euros, and were trading down 1.2 percent at 7.04 euros at
4:48 p.m. in Helsinki.  
 The Finnish company has announced just one handset, the N8,
from its new high-end line based on revamped Symbian 3 software,
while Apple’s recently unveiled iPhone 4 is flying off virtual
shelves with 600,000 pre-orders and other vendors are rolling
out models with  Google Inc. ’s Android software.  
 ‘Sustained’ Margins  
 Nokia said in April that the N8 will be shipped sometime in
the third quarter. It is also slated to introduce a second line
of high-end devices running the MeeGo operating system developed
with Intel Corp. at an unspecified date this year.  
 A return to stable outlook would require evidence of a
stronger smartphone range following new product launches as well
as evidence of the group’s operating margin returning to 2009
levels “on a sustained basis,” Raab said. If the operating
margin doesn’t recover after the third quarter, the ratings
agency may downgrade the company in 2011, he said.  
 The Nokia Siemens Networks unit, a joint venture with
 Siemens AG  that is being restructured, is also a drag on
profits, the ratings agency said.  
 Nokia has long-term debt of about $3.65 billion. It has
about 9.7 billion euros ($11.9 billion) of cash and short-term
investments, and the prospect of “solid” cash generation, Raab
wrote in the report. Its expenses include a research and
development program that consumed 5.9 billion euros last year,
and a record of paying dividends with last year’s costing 1.5
billion euros.  
 “Nokia continues to benefit from a strong balance sheet
and liquidity position,” S&P said, adding that it considers the
handset maker has a “conservative” financial policy.
