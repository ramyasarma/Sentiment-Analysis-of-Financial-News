             Intesa Sanpaolo SpA , Italy’s second-
biggest bank, postponed an initial public offering of its  Banca
Fideuram SpA  asset-management unit because of “unfavorable”
market conditions.  
 Milan-based Intesa didn’t indicate in a statement today
when it might reconsider the company’s listing. “Further
developments will be duly disclosed to the market,” the bank
said.  
 The delay may threaten Intesa Chief Executive Officer
 Corrado Passera ’s plan to strengthen capital this year by
shedding non-strategic assets. Intesa joins companies KOS SpA
and Moby SpA, which have canceled IPOs this month as Italy’s
benchmark FTSE MIB Index dropped 12 percent this year.  
 Intesa would have risked selling shares at a price that
valued Fideuram at below the 2.6 billion-euro ($3.2 billion)
book value in its 2009 annual accounts if it proceeded with the
IPO. Intesa planned to sell at least 50 percent of Fideuram.  
 Fideuram, whose 4,300 private bankers advise clients on
stock and bond investments, specializes in individuals’ savings.
The Rome-based company holds 70 billion euros of assets, ranking
No. 1 in Italy.  
 Intesa has been in talks to sell part of Fideuram to
private-equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC. Intesa didn’t
comment on the status of those discussions in today’s statement.  
 Fideuram’s IPO would have been the largest in Italy since
oil refiner Saras SpA sold 2.1 billion euros of shares five
years ago.
