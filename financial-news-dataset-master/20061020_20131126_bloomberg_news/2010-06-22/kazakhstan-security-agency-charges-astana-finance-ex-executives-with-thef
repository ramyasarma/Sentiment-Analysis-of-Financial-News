             Kazakhstan’s National Security
Committee, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB, charged
defaulted AO Astana Finance’s former Chairman Kintal Islamov and
former Chief Executive Officer Artur Akhmetov with theft.  
 The Astana-based court sanctioned the house arrest of the
former executives on June 18, the National Security Committee
said in a  statement  on its website today.  
 Astana Finance stopped paying interest and principal on
$175 million of bonds in May last year. The total principal
amount of debt affected by the moratorium is around $1.7
billion, the Astana-based company said in June, 2009. The
government’s National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna controls
25.51 percent of Astana Finance, the fund’s  website  shows.  
 No one immediately answered the phone registered for Artur
Akhmetov in Astana, while no phone number is registered for
Kintal Islamov in the Kazakh capital.
