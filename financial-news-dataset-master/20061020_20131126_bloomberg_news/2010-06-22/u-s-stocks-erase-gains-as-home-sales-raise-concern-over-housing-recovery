             U.S. stocks erased gains after sales
of existing homes unexpectedly dropped in May, stoking concern
the housing market is struggling to recover.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,112.84 at 10:02 a.m. in New York after rising as
much as 0.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.12
points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,448.53, paring a gain of 51
points.
