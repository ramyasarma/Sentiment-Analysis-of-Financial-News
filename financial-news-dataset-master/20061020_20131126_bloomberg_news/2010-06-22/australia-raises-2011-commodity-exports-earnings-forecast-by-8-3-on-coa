             Australia, the world’s largest
shipper of coal, iron ore and wool, raised its forecast for
2011 export earnings by 8.3 percent on increased contract prices
for iron ore and coking coal.  
 Exports will be worth A$202.5 billion ($178 billion) in the
12 months ended June 2011, an increase of 23 percent on the
expected fiscal 2010 result of A$164.1 billion, the Canberra-
based Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
said today in an e-mailed statement today.  
 In March, the bureau said 2011 export earnings would be
worth A$187 billion.
