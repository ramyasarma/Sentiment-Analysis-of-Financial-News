             Copper may be designated a precious
metal in South Africa to make it more difficult for thieves of
the commodity to trade it,  Business Day  reported, citing Public
Enterprises Minister  Barbara Hogan .  
 South Africa loses as much as 7 billion rand ($930 million)
every year because of theft of copper cables that are used for
commuter transport and telecommunications, the Johannesburg-
daily paper reported, citing the Democratic Alliance, an
opposition party.
