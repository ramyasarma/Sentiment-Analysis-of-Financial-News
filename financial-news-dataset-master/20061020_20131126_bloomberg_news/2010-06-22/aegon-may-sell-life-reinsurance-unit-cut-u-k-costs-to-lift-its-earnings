             Aegon NV , the Dutch owner of U.S.
insurer  Transamerica Corp. , may consider selling its life
reinsurance unit and said it plans to cut costs in the U.K. as
it seeks to boost earnings.  
 “Aegon believes that, over the longer term, there is only
a limited strategic fit between Transamerica Reinsurance and its
core activities,” The Hague-based company said today. The
insurer said it has begun exploring options for the unit, which
has a book value of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion), including
finding a suitable buyer who would regard reinsurance as core to
its business.  
 The company set additional earnings targets in June 2008,
three months before New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy and financial markets collapsed. Aegon aims
to cut 25 percent of costs in the U.K. by the end of 2011 and
increase the return on capital and withdraw from the country’s
bulk annuities market, it said today.  
 “The U.K. is a difficult market,” Chief Executive Officer
 Alex Wynaendts  said in a video transcript on the company’s
website. “We’ve come to the conclusion in the current market
environment that the best value for shareholders is to implement
a restructuring and that’s what we’re doing.”  
 Aegon, which got 3 billion euros in aid from the Dutch
government in 2008 and repaid one-third of the money in
November, has climbed 12 percent to 5.10 euros in Amsterdam
trading this year, valuing the company at 8.86 billion euros.
That compares with a 1.3 percent drop in the 34-member  Stoxx
Europe 600 Insurance Index .  
 U.K. Business  
 European insurers including Axa SA and Prudential Plc are
seeking to free up capital reserves used to back policies in
slower-growing markets like the U.K. to fund growth in Asia,
where margins are wider. Paris-based Axa, Europe’s second-
biggest insurer, said on June 14 that it’s in talks to sell part
of its U.K. life insurance unit to  Clive Cowdery ’s Resolution
Ltd. for 2.75 billion pounds ($4.1 billion).  
 Aegon, whose origins date back to 1759, is preparing to
sell its British life and pensions business, including Scottish
Equitable, for 1.5 billion pounds, the  Mail on Sunday  reported
June 20, without saying where it got the information.  
 “A full disposal would be at a significant discount to its
value,” Wynaendts said.  
 The insurer is scheduled to hold a two-day analyst and
investor conference in London, starting today.
