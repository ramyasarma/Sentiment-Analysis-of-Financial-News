             Borders Group Inc.  plans to sell the
Kobo e-reader with a $20 gift card to lure customers after
Amazon.com Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. cut prices for their own
electronic devices.  
 Members of the retailer’s rewards service will receive the
card and double “Borders Bucks,” totaling a $10 credit, with
any Kobo purchase, said  Mary Davis , a company spokeswoman.
Kobo’s $149.99 price will be maintained, the Ann Arbor,
Michigan-based company said today in a statement.  
 Yesterday, Seattle-based  Amazon.com  reduced the price of
its Kindle device 27 percent to $189, while New York-based
 Barnes & Noble  slashed the Nook’s price 23 percent to $199 and
released a Wi-Fi-only version for $149.  
 U.S. sales of digital reading devices are projected to
reach 5 million units this year from 2.2 million in 2009,
according to the Consumer Electronics Association, an industry
trade group. Borders began selling the Kobo in May in a market
dominated by Amazon.com and Sony Corp. Sony’s readers sell for
$169.99, $199.99 and $349.99.  
 Dan Walsh, a spokesman for Sony’s reader business, declined
to comment yesterday when asked about possible price changes.
 Mary Ellen Keating , a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble, declined
to comment further on pricing and e-mailed a statement that said
the company is “offering consumers greater choice and even
greater value with Nook 3G and Nook Wi-Fi.”  
 In addition to the Kobo Inc. device,  Borders , the second-
largest U.S. bookstore chain, sells two Sony readers and the
$119.99 Libre eBook Reader Pro made by Aluratek Inc.  
 Borders fell 8 cents, or 5 percent, to $1.52 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange  composite trading . The stock has
gained 29 percent this year.
