             Colombia’s peso rose to a three-
month high after the central bank said it would end its daily
dollar purchases this month.  
 The peso also jumped as much as 0.8 percent on speculation
the government will sell bonds and get loans overseas after
President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos  said yesterday the new
administration won’t sell a stake in power company Isagen SA to
finance spending, according to Daniel Velandia, head analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.  
 “If Isagen isn’t sold, the government will probably opt
for external financing, which implies bringing in more
dollars,” said Velandia.  
 The peso gained 0.2 percent to 1,889.30 per U.S. dollar at
3:31 p.m. New York time, from 1,893.03 yesterday. That’s the
strongest level on a closing basis since March 9. The peso is up
8.2 percent this year, the biggest advance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Colombia said last month it would leave the decision to
sell its 57 percent stake in Isagen to the new government. Funds
from the sale -- estimated at 3 trillion pesos ($1.59 billion) -
- are needed to cover spending in the final three months of the
year, Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga  has said.  
 Policy makers said March 3 the central bank would buy $20
million a day through June 30 to curb a rally they say left the
peso “misaligned.”  
 Velandia forecasts the central bank will resume the daily
dollar purchases through year-end to ease gains in the peso.  
 “Considering the significant dollar flows from foreign
direct investment, and given the need for the government to
bring in dollars to fund spending, there’s a high chance the
bank will continue buying dollars,” said Velandia. “They may
even increase the amount” to $40 million or $50 million daily,
he said.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.93
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.213 centavo to 120.735 centavos per peso.
