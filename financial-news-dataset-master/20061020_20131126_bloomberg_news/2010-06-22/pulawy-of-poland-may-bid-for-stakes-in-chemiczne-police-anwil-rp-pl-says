             Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA, the 
state-controlled company that’s Poland’s largest fertilizer 
maker, is considering making a bid for its rival Zaklady 
Chemiczne Police SA as the country’s government is selling its 
majority stakes in both companies, Rp.pl reported, citing an 
interview with Pulawy’s Chief Executive Officer Pawel 
Jarczewski.  
 Pulawy is still interested in buying Anwil SA, a chemical 
unit of oil refiner PKN Orlen SA, after it failed with its bid 
earlier this month, Jarczewski said, the website of 
Rzeczpospolita newspaper reported.
