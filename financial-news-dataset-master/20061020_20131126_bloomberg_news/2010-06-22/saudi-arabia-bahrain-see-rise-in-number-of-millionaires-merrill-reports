                  June 22 (Bloomberg) --Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s
largest economy, saw the number of people with investible assets
of $1 million or more rise 14.3 percent last year, according to
a Merrill Lynch & Co. and Capgemini SA report.  
 The kingdom had 104,700 high net worth individuals by the
end of last year, according to the report.  
 The number of high net worth individuals in Bahrain rose by
7.2 percent to 5,400, according to the report while the number
in the United Arab Emirates dropped 18.8 percent to 54,500 due
to “unprecedented” market conditions.  
 The wealth of the 10 million people globally with more than
$1 million to invest rose 18.9 percent to $39 trillion in 2009,
according to the survey published today. That compares with
$40.7 trillion spread among 10.1 million two years earlier,
before assets slumped to $32.8 trillion in 2008.
