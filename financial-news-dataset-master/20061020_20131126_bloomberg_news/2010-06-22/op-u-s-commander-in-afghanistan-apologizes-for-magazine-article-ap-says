             General Stanley McChrystal, the top
U.S. commander in Afghanistan, apologized today for an interview
in which he said he felt “betrayed” by his diplomatic partner
in Kabul, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Associated Press reported.  
 “I extend my sincerest apology for this profile. It was a
mistake reflecting poor judgment and should never have
happened,” McChrystal said in a statement from the Afghan
capital, referring to a story in this week’s issue of Rolling
Stone, AP said.
