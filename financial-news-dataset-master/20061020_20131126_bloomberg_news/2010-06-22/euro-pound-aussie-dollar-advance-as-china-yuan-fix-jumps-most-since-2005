             The euro climbed after China set
today’s yuan rate at 6.7980 per U.S. dollar, up 0.43 percent
from yesterday’s fixing in the biggest change since 2005.  
 The British pound and Australian dollar also advanced as
the move spurred investors’ appetite for riskier assets.  
 The euro rose to as high as $1.2354 and traded at $1.2331
as of 10:25 a.m. in Tokyo, from $1.2312 yesterday in New York.
The pound strengthened to $1.4773 from $1.4747 and the
Australian currency gained 0.4 percent to 88.02 U.S. cents.
