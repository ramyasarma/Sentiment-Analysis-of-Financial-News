             TeliaSonera AB  said a Russian court
ruled in favor of a lawsuit seeking to block the planned merger
of its stake in OAO MegaFon, the country’s third-largest
wireless phone company, with that of Alfa Group.  
 TeliaSonera expects to appeal the ruling and has not
changed its plans,  Cecilia Edstroem , a spokeswoman for the
Stockholm-based phone company, said by telephone today. The
court ruled in favor of OAO Telecominvest, a MegaFon shareholder
that sued in April to block the merger of the holdings.  
 Telecominvest, controlled by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ,
cited a Russian law that bars state-controlled foreign investors
from taking control of strategic companies such as MegaFon.
TeliaSonera’s biggest shareholders are the Swedish and Finnish
governments, with a combined 51 percent  stake . The company also
plans to merge its stake in Turkey’s Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS with that of Alfa, billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s
holding company.  
 “To us this is very premature, as we have not filed for
any regulatory approval yet,” Edstroem said. It will probably
take another week for the company to have access to the ruling,
“but I expect we will appeal as we think this is very strange,”
she said.  
 “We are considering a possibility for an appeal,” said
Evgeny Dumalkin, spokesman for Alfa Group’s Altimo unit. Altimo
also hasn’t seen a copy of the court ruling, which will be made
public on June 28, he added.  
 TeliaSonera has focused its work so far on the merger of
the  Turkish  assets, Edstroem said. TeliaSonera and Alfa plan to
create a new company to hold the MegaFon and Turkcell stakes.
