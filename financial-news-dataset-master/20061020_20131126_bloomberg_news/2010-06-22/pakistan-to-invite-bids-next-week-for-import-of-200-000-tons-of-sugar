             Trading Corp. of Pakistan plans to
invite bids next week for buying 200,000 metric tons of refined
sugar, Chairman  Anjum Bashir  said.  
 “The tender will open in the first week of August,” he
said in a telephone interview from Karachi today.  
 Pakistan plans to import a total of 1.2 million tons of
sugar to control growing demand and prices. The Asian country
has bought 825,000 tons so far and yesterday called bids to
purchase 200,000 tons in a tender to be awarded on July 31.
