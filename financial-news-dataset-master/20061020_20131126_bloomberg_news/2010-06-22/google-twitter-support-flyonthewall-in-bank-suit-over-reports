             Google Inc.  asked a federal appeals
court to reverse a lower court’s order blocking online financial
news service Theflyonthewall.com Inc. from issuing immediate
reports of banks’ stock upgrades and downgrades.  
 The March ruling by U.S. District Judge  Denise Cote  in New
York could impair the distribution of factual information over
the Internet and have a negative impact on a wide variety of
online services, Google, joined by Twitter Inc., said today in a
so-called friend-of-the-court brief filed with the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York.  
 “In a world of modern communications technology, where
anyone with a cell phone may disseminate news throughout the
world even as it is occurring, the notion that a single media
outlet should have a monopoly on time-sensitive facts is not
only contrary to law, it is, as a practical matter, futile,”
 Google  and Twitter said in the filing.  
 The appeals court in May granted a request by
Theflyonthewall.com, based in Summit, New Jersey, to delay the
lower court’s order while its appeal is pending. The appeals
court last month also granted expedited consideration of the
lawsuit filed by  Barclays Plc , Bank of  America Corp. ’s Merrill
Lynch and  Morgan Stanley .  
 The banks accused Theflyonthewall.com of “free riding” on
their research reports by sending headlines on upgrades and
downgrades. Cote ruled Theflyonthewall.com must wait until after
the financial exchanges open in New York before repeating pre-
market reports by the banks. For reports issued when the market
is open, Cote ordered a two-hour delay.  
 ‘Protected’ Speech  
 Google , owner of the world’s most popular search engine,
and Twitter, the microblogging service with 190 million users,
said in their filing that reporting of truthful information is
“one of the most protected forms of speech” under the U.S.
Constitution.  
 Benjamin E. Marks, a lawyer representing the banks, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment after regular business
hours.  
 The case is Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com.,
10-1372, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District (New
York.)
