             RDB Industries Ltd. , an Indian
cigarette maker, tumbled the most in 12 years after it spun off
its real estate unit.  
 The shares sank as much as 50 percent and traded 45 percent
lower at 84 rupees as of 10:39 a.m. in Mumbai, poised for their
steepest one-day decline since July 1998.  
 RDB, which sells cigarettes under its Regent brand,  spun
off  RDB Realty & Infrastructure Ltd. as of today. Real estate
accounted for 80 percent of RDB’s sales in the year ended March
31, while tobacco made up about 19 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday said it would remove
the stock’s daily trading limit for today to allow the shares to
trade at “a realistic price level,” according to its statement.
