             Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s emergency budget is a “strong statement of intent”
to tackle the U.K.’s public finances, Fitch Ratings said.  
 Osborne today raised sales tax, imposed a levy on banks and
cut welfare benefits to eliminate a  spending shortfall  that
reached 11 percent of gross domestic product in the last fiscal
year. Fitch, which rates Britain’s debt the top AAA grade, said
June 8 the U.K. faced a “formidable” fiscal challenge.  
 The tax and spending plans illustrate the government’s
commitment to cut the shortfall and are “materially stronger”
than those set out by former Chancellor  Alistair Darling  in
March, Fitch said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “Fitch’s preliminary assessment of today’s budget is that
it sets out an ambitious deficit-reduction path that, if
delivered upon, will materially strengthen confidence in U.K.
public finances and its AAA status,”  David Riley , head of
sovereign ratings at Fitch, said in the statement.  
 “However, securing the reductions in ‘unprotected’
departmental and welfare spending will be very challenging and
the spending review announced for Oct. 20, 2010, will be
important in detailing and enhancing the credibility of today’s
budget announcements.”
