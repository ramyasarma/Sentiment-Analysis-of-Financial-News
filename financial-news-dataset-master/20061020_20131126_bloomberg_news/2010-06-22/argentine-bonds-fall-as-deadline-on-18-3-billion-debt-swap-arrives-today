             Argentine bonds declined, snapping a
nine-day streak of gains, as the government’s offer to
restructure $18.3 billion in defaulted debt expired.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent bonds due in 2015 rose
57 basis points, or 0.57 percentage point, to 13 percent at 5:30
p.m. New York time. The price slid 1.82 cents to 79.17 cents on
the dollar.  
 The restructuring offer expired at 5 p.m. New York time.
The swap of bonds held out of a 2005 settlement has attracted
creditors holding $12.5 billion, or about 68 percent, of the
eligible outstanding defaulted notes, Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Ambito Financiero reported without citing the source
of its information. Economy Ministry spokesman Sergio Poggi
declined to comment on the report.  
 “Clearly they failed to really attract people to tender,
so now it’s left to the retail investors,”  Laura Tribuno , an
emerging markets trader with RBC Capital Markets, said in a
telephone interview from New York. “They can leave it open and
over time maybe they’ll increase participation, but it’s going
to be a very slow process and as such will have zero impact on
the market.”  
 The government may announce results of the exchange
tomorrow, an Economy Ministry official said today on the
condition he not be identified in accordance with policy.  
 The restructuring offer includes dollar bonds due in 2033,
warrants linked to gross domestic product and bonds due in 2017
to pay past-due interest. The offer doesn’t include past-due
payments on the GDP warrants.  
 2001 Default  
 President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  opened the debt
swap May 3, five years after her husband and predecessor,  Nestor Kirchner , offered creditors about 30 cents on the dollar, the
harshest restructuring terms since at least World War II,
according to  Arturo Porzecanski , an international finance
professor at American University in Washington.  
 Argentina defaulted on a record $95 billion of debt in
2001. Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  says a successful
restructuring will help South America’s second-biggest economy
regain access to international credit markets and lower
borrowing costs for provinces and companies that seek to sell
debt.  
 The peso slid 0.1 percent today to 3.9265 per dollar, from
3.9244 at the end of last week. Argentine markets were closed
yesterday for a national holiday.
