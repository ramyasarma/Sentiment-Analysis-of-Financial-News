             German electricity for delivery next
year fell from its highest close in almost eight months as
commodity prices tracked weaker stock markets and reduced
generation costs at plants burning fossil fuels.  
 Baseload power for 2011 in Europe’s biggest market slid
1.30 euros, or 2.4 percent, to 53.80 euros ($66.04) a megawatt-
hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg as of 5
p.m. Berlin time. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  
 European equities  fell after gaining for nine days. Energy
traders monitor stock markets for an indication of a country’s
economic performance and energy demand. German next-year power,
a European benchmark, yesterday rose 1 percent to 55.10 euros,
its highest close since Oct. 23.  
 “We’re seeing some weakness today, but the biggest picture
points toward an upward trend,”  Sebastien Terryn , a risk
manager at Summit Energy Services Inc. in Waregem, Belgium, said
today by e-mail. “It all depends on how natural gas prices will
evolve as we move into the European summer period.”  
 Winter U.K. natural gas, for delivery from October through
March, fell as much as 3 percent to 523.85 pence a therm. Coal
for 2011 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp lost as
much as 3 percent to $99.50 a metric ton. Germany generates
about a fifth of its power by burning coal. The country also
gets electricity from nuclear, wind and solar plants.  
 German next-year power traded as high as 55.50 euros on May
10, the highest price since October. Bloomberg tracks power
prices from brokers including GFI Group Inc., ICAP Plc and
Spectron Group Ltd.
