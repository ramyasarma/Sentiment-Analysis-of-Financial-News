             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle port, the world’s biggest export harbor for the fuel
used in power stations, rose 23 percent last week while the
number of vessels waiting to load increased.  
 The volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time
June 21 climbed to 2.04 million metric tons from 1.66 million
tons in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its
website today. Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and BHP Billiton Ltd.
are among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor.  
 Fifty-one  vessels were outside the harbor, up from 48 a
week earlier. The queue reached 60 in December, the longest
since July 2007. Coal ships waited to load for an average of
14.67 days, up from 12.30 days, the port said in its report.
That compares with 2.26 days for general-cargo vessels.  
 Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
rose by 1.1 percent, increasing for a third week, according to
the  globalCOAL  NEWC Index. Prices climbed to $100.40 a ton from
$99.30 in the week to June 18.
