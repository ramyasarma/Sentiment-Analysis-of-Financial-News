             Brazil’s oil regulator said its
board authorized hiring a firm to evaluate the size of offshore
crude reserves that the government plans to swap for new shares
in state-controlled producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  
 The ANP, as the regulator is known, said today in an e-mail
that it hired Gaffney, Cline & Associates Inc. to evaluate the
pre-salt reserves by the end of August.
