             Adobe Systems Inc. , the biggest
maker of graphic-design programs, forecast sales that topped
analysts’ estimates after releasing a long-awaited update of its
most-profitable software, known as CS5.  
 Revenue  in the third quarter will be $950 million to $1
billion, San Jose, California-based Adobe said today in a
statement.  Analysts  on average estimated $962 million in sales.  
 Adobe is benefiting from pent-up demand for the latest
version of its flagship software, Creative Suite 5, released at
the end of April. Chief Executive Officer  Shantanu Narayen , 47,
is working to persuade advertisers, website developers and
graphic designers who refrained from software purchases amid the
recession to upgrade to CS5 as the economy rebounds.  
 “These products are the cornerstone of what designers work
in for eight to 10 hours a day,” said  Sasa Zorovic , an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Boston. “They use Adobe’s
products as much as you and I use e-mail and spreadsheets.” He
recommends buying Adobe shares and doesn’t own any.  
 Sales of Creative applications, including Photoshop and
Illustrator, account for almost 60 percent of  annual revenue .  
 Last quarter, which ended June 4, net income rose 18
percent to $148.6 million, or 28 cents a share, from $126.1
million, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Excluding some costs,
profit was 44 cents a share, compared with the 43-cent average
of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sales rose 34 percent to $943 million, Adobe said. That
compares with the average estimate of $906.9 million.  
 ‘In-Line’ Forecast  
 This quarter, profit excluding some costs will be 46 cents
to 50 cents a share.  Analysts  on average estimated 49 cents.  
 “Investors wanted a more aggressive outlook, given the
strong second-quarter results,” said  Andy Miedler , a St. Louis-
based analyst for Edward Jones & Co. “These were strong results
for CS5 out of the gate, but the guidance was mostly in line.”
He advises investors to buy the shares, which he doesn’t own.  
 In extended trading, Adobe slipped 1.9 percent to $32.13
after falling 37 cents to $32.76 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares have lost 11 percent
this year.  
 The current version of Adobe’s Creative Suite comprises
five different collections of as many as 15 applications. In
CS5, most of those programs rely on Adobe’s Flash video
software, making it easier for designers to add online videos
and animation into their creations.  
 Apple Flap  
 Narayen is counting on sales to customers that eschewed new
software purchases as the economy shrank. Creative Suite 4
debuted in October 2008, just as the financial crisis deepened.  
 Adobe faces public criticism from Apple Inc. CEO  Steve Jobs , who has banned Flash from Apple’s iPhone and iPad mobile
devices and faulted it as slow, buggy and power hungry. Still,
19 of the 20 biggest handset makers have committed to supporting
Flash, Adobe has said.  
 “Adobe feeds off people developing for all of the Web, on
all devices,” said  Walter Pritchard , an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in San Francisco. “There’s more growth there than with
people developing only for the iPhone.”  
 The third quarter is typically Adobe’s slowest of the year,
as companies in Europe shut down for vacation in August.
