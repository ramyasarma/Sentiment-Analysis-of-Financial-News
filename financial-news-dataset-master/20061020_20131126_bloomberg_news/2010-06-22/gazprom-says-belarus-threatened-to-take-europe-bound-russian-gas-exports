             OAO Gazprom spokesman Sergei
Kupriyanov said Belarus First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir
Semashko threatened in a letter to take gas from the Russian
company’s Europe-bound shipments if the country’s supplies were
reduced further.  
 Kupriyanov was speaking to reporters in Moscow. Gazprom cut
supplies to Belarus by 30 percent today, after a 15 percent
reduction yesterday, as talks about unpaid gas supply and
transit failed.
