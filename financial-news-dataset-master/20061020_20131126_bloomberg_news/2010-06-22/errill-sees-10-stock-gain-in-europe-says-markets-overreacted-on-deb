             Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
markets have “overreacted” to the debt crisis in Europe and it
expects a 10 percent gain in the region’s stocks by the end of
this year.  
 “Recovery is on the way,”  Bill O’Neill , chief investment
officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in an
interview in Istanbul today. “We like the core European
markets, the export-led industries, particularly industrials
based in Germany, Benelux, France.”  
 Europe’s benchmark  Stoxx 600  Index has advanced 11 percent
from its 2010 low on May 25 through yesterday as concern eased
that indebted European nations from Greece to Portugal face a
worsening debt crisis. The measure remains 5.9 percent below
this year’s peak on April 15 on speculation tackling debt will
damp economic growth, falling 0.8 percent today.  
 Leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized nations will meet
June 26 to consider ways to reduce deficits and unprecedented
levels of government debt without harming the global recovery.  
 Merrill favors continental Europe, the U.K. and emerging
markets in Asia, and is “less confident” about the outlook for
the U.S. and Japan, said O’Neill, who helps manage about $1.4
trillion.  
 Merrill’s holdings are “quite overweight” on European
stocks, he said. “We are looking possibly for another 10
percent” gain, he said.  
 The euro fell for a second day, to $1.2270 as of 1:46 p.m.
in London. Merrill forecasts the euro will weaken to $1.15 by
the end of 2010 and to $1.10 by the end of 2011.  
 “After the recovery, we see the euro weakening again
against the dollar,” said O’Neill. Company earnings in Europe
will be “strengthened by the weakness of the euro” through
2011, he said.
