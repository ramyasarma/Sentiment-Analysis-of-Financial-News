             The German Finance Ministry said the
so-called structural budget deficit - the shortfall in normal
economic times -  will be 53.2 billion euros this year, less
than the 66.6 billion euros originally expected.  
 Net new borrowing this year will be 15 billion euros below
the 80.2 billion euros laid down in the 2010 budget plan, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement.
