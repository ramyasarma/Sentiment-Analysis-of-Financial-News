             Japanese banks should focus on
profitability at home before trying to compete with global
investment banking rivals overseas, said newly appointed
Financial Services Minister  Shozaburo Jimi .  
 “Strengthening profitability is the task for Japanese
banks,” said Jimi, 64, who became minister on June 11. “I’m
not sure if the banks should leapfrog overseas.”  
 Japan’s three largest banks seized on the opportunities
created by the global financial crisis, purchasing stakes in U.S.
and European banks in 2008 to increase earnings from overseas
and boost their investment banking businesses.  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc.  invested in Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch &
Co., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. bought a stake in
Morgan Stanley and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. acquired
shares of Barclays Plc.  
 “Japanese banks have not been good at investment banking
in the way Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is,” Jimi told reporters in
Tokyo today. “They have to consider this history. Stabilizing
the financial system here is important.”  
 The minister said he isn’t giving instructions to banks and
that their managements are responsible for business decisions
about global strategies.  
 Jimi replaced  Shizuka Kamei  who quit after new Prime
Minister  Naoto Kan  declined to extend a parliamentary session to
pass changes in banking and postal laws. Jimi is a member of
Kamei’s People’s New Party, a junior coalition partner in the
government led by Kan and the Democratic Party of Japan.  
 Mizuho is preparing to sell shares in its second public
offering of stock since July 2009 to strengthen capital. The
Tokyo-based bank, which issued American depositary receipts
traded on the New York Stock Exchange in 2006 as it sought more
investment banking business, invested $1.2 billion in Merrill
Lynch in 2008.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui invested 500 million pounds ($740 million)
in Barclays and Mitsubishi UFJ paid $9 billion for a stake in
Morgan Stanley.
