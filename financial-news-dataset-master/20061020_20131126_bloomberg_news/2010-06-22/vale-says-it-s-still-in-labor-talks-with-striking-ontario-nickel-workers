             Vale SA , the world’s fourth-largest
nickel producer, said it’s still in contract talks with workers
in Ontario who have been on strike for almost a year.  
 Both sides have agreed not to speak publicly about the
talks while they are under way,  Cory McPhee , a spokesman for Rio
de Janeiro-based Vale, said today in a telephone interview.  
 About 3,000 workers represented by the United Steelworkers
union at Vale nickel operations in Sudbury and Port Colborne,
Ontario, have been on strike since July 13. The latest round of
negotiations began June 19.  
 Wayne Fraser , a USW spokesman and director, wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  
 Mediator Kevin Burnett has said “progress was made” in
negotiations that took place June 4-7.  
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Jinchuan Group Ltd. and BHP
Billiton Ltd. were the world’s biggest producers of refined
nickel in 2009.
