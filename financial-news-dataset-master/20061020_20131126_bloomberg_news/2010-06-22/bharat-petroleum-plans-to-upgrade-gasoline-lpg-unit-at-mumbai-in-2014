             Bharat Petroleum Corp. , India’s
second-biggest state refiner, plans to shut a catalytic cracking
unit at its Mumbai refinery for 45 days starting January 2014 to
upgrade the 55-year-old unit.  
 The refiner will replace parts, including a reactor, to
make the 3,500 ton-a-day unit produce additional liquefied
petroleum gas and gasoline by converting higher quantities of
residue, according to a tender document on the company’s  website .
Bharat Petroleum plans to issue bid documents in August and
award the contract in March next year, according to the document.  
 The refiner will close a 15,000 metric ton-a-day crude
distillation unit, a 2,500 ton-a-day catalytic cracking unit and
a 4,200 ton-a-day feed preparation unit at the refinery in
October this year, according to a separate tender document.  
 Bharat Petroleum’s 12 million ton-a-year Mumbai refinery is
its largest plant. The company also operates a 9.5 million ton-
a-year plant in the southern city of  Kochi  and a 3 million ton-
a-year refinery in the eastern state of  Assam .
