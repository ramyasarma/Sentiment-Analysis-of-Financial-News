             Gold futures fell for the second
straight day on bets that the rally to a record was overdone.  
 Yesterday, the metal dropped 1.4 percent, the most in a
month, after reaching an all-time high of $1,266.50 an ounce.
Before today, gold gained 13 percent this year, partly on demand
for a haven amid Europe’s sovereign-debt woes.  
 “Once gold made new highs, it should have continued,”
said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset
Management. “Since it failed, the market has to go back to
support, and that’s around $1,210 to $1,215.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,236.90 at 9:16 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  
 Yesterday, the dollar’s rally eroded the appeal of the
metal as an alternative investment. The greenback was little
changed today against a basket of major currencies.  
 Gold historically has moved inversely to the dollar. The
metal climbed to records in euros, sterling and Swiss francs
this month.  
 “You’re seeing the flight-to-quality fears out of Europe
subsiding and gold returning to its classic relationship to the
dollar,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  
 Silver futures for July delivery were little changed at
$18.83 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $4.60, or 0.3
percent, to $1,594.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $8.20, or
1.7 percent, to $487.25 an ounce.
