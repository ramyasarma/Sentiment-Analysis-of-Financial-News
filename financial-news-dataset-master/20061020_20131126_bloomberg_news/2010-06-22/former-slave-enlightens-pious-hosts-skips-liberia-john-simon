             ‘Freed,” by Charles Smith, is a
remarkable work with much to say; it deserves to be seen by
anyone justly disappointed with most other new offerings off-
Broadway and on.  
 “Freed” is based on key events in the life of John Newton
Templeton, the first American black to graduate (from  Ohio
University ) with an advanced college degree in the Midwest, and
one of only four anywhere way back in 1828. An ex-slave, he was
to found and head, in Pittsburgh, the first school for black
children, as well as become a journalist and political activist.  
 This is not some facile piece of liberal agit-prop. It is
realistic and highly literate, equally gripping the mind and the
heart. Here is that rare play to provocatively address such
issues as history, politics, philosophy, education, religion,
racism, feminism, freedom and morality, and do so without
preaching, dice-loading or loose verbiage.  
 Templeton was a young man who learned Latin, Greek and
Hebrew in Bible studies and was picked by the Reverend Robert
Wilson, president of Ohio U., to achieve a graduate degree. He
stayed with the Wilsons, because students in the dormitories
would not share with a black.  
 God’s Will  
 There are other hurdles. Mrs. Jane Wilson, though
enlightened in other ways, is a bit of a racist. John is to do
some service, but not to be a mere houseboy, an unpaid servant.
Wilson himself, liberal enough in some ways, keeps pushing for
the will of God as the liberator, allegedly telling him that
John must go off to be the first president of Liberia.  
 John doesn’t want to. He is preparing a lecture for
admission to the Literary Society on “Why should ex-slaves go
back to a land that sent them into slavery in the first place,”
and, to Wilson’s surprise, wants to be paid for his services
and, even more important, repay Wilson for room and board.  
 Slowly he wins over Mrs. Wilson, who comes to realize that
racism is kin to patriarchalism, and, by courageous resistance,
compels Wilson to fathom that all other freedoms are worthless
without the freedom of choice, which includes the freedom to
interpret the will of God.  
 There are only three characters in this admirably and
economically structured play, but along with references to
plentiful others, they richly evoke a conflicted world.  
 Joe Brancato has superbly directed Sheldon Best (John),
Christopher McCann, and Emma O’Donnell -- all of whom delineate
important evolutions with subtle grace -- on a simple but
effective set by Joseph J. Egan, with persuasive costumes by
Patricia E. Doherty, and versatile lighting by Martin E.
Vreeland.

 ‘Little Doc’  
 The exact antithesis is to be seen in the  Rattlestick
Theater  production of Dan Klores’s “Little Doc,” a memory play
crying out for oblivion.  
 Klores, successful in other fields, has not the least
talent for playwriting, as this inept, even incomprehensible,
attempt about his Brooklyn youth -- involving various addictions
and infighting for seven nonentities and bores -- painfully
exhibits. A first play, dismally staged by John Gould Rubin and
wretchedly acted by seven patsies, it easily deserves to be the
last.
