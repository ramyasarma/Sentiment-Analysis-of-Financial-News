             Whitbread Plc , the U.K. operator of
the Costa Coffee chain, said fiscal first-quarter sales at
outlets open at least a year rose 7.6 percent, led by the
company’s Premier Inn budget-hotel chain.  
 Total sales gained 14 percent in the 13 weeks ended June 3,
the Dunstable, England-based company said today in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service. Whitbread said
Premier was helped by increased marketing and a flexible-pricing
plan that attracted more weekend customers.  
 Whitbread is expanding Costa Coffee in Asia, the Middle
East and Central Europe, as well as the U.K. Premier Inn is
adding hotels in the U.K.  
 “People are looking for value-for-money vacations in the
U.K.,” Chief Executive Officer  Alan Parker  said on a conference
call. “We’re looking to benefit from that trend.”  
 Whitbread rose 57 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 1,535 pence at
8:06 a.m. in London, after earlier gaining as much as 4.9
percent. The shares have risen 8.8 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 2.7 billion pounds ($4 billion).  
 Costa same-store sales gained 8.5 percent in the quarter
and total revenue increased 27 percent. The company introduced a
loyalty-card program in March.  
 Whitbread added 55 Costa outlets during the quarter and
plans 250 during the fiscal year.  
 At Whitbread’s pub restaurants, which include Beefeater and
Brewers Fayre, same-outlet revenue gained 3.6 percent, with
total sales up 4.2 percent, the company said.
