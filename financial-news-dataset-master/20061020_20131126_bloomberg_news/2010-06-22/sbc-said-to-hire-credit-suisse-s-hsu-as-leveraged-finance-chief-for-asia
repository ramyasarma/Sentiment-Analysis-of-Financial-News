             HSBC Holdings Plc  hired  Lyndon Hsu 
from Credit Suisse Group AG as head of leveraged and acquisition
finance for Asia-Pacific, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  
 Hsu, who resigned yesterday after 14 years with the Swiss
bank, will continue to be based in Hong Kong and start with HSBC
in late September, the person said, asking not to be identified
as details are private. He will report to  Oliver Duff , HSBC’s
London-based global head of leveraged finance, the person said.  
 Credit Suisse spokeswoman  Josephine Lee  and HSBC
spokeswoman  Annie Cheng  declined to comment. Hsu declined to
comment when contacted by telephone in Hong Kong.  
 Hsu’s appointment was reported earlier in International
Financing Review.
