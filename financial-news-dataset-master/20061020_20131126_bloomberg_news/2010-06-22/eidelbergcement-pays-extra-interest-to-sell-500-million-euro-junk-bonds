             HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s
third-largest cement maker, is paying a premium to sell high-
yield bonds as corporate-debt sales start to revive after
Europe’s fiscal crisis roiled markets.  
 The building materials company increased the size of the
deal by 30 percent to 650 million euros ($797 million) and set
the yield of the December 2015 notes at 6.875 percent, more than
the 6.75 percent it paid when it sold 650 million euros of
similar-dated notes in January. Those securities now trade at
6.5 percent, according to Bloomberg composite prices.  
 “The new Heidelberg bond looks cheap compared with
existing notes, and the company is offering a new-issue premium
that ensures it sells,” said  Alex Moss , a fund manager at
Insight Investment Management in London, which manages 100
billion pounds ($147 billion) of assets. “It’s likely to be
snapped up by investors looking for more yield.”  
 Company bond sales in Europe jumped to 4.9 billion euros
yesterday, up from a daily average of 1.9 billion euros this
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Measures by
governments to cut record budget deficits and a $1 trillion
European Union-led bailout package for the region’s most
troubled economies are containing the sovereign debt crisis,
which started in Greece four months ago.  
 High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated lower than Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold the debt fell 23
basis points yesterday to an average 9.67 percent, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The spread was as low
as 8.33 percent in April.  
 HeidelbergCement is  rated Ba3  by Moody’s Investors Service,
three levels below investment-grade, and an equivalent BB- by
Standard & Poor’s.
