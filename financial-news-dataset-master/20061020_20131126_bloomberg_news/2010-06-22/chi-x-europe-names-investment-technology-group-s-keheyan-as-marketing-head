             Chi-X Europe Ltd. , the region’s
biggest alternative stock-trading system, hired Belinda Keheyan
from  Investment Technology Group Inc. , reuniting Chief Executive
Officer  Alasdair Haynes  with his former head of marketing.  
 Keheyan, 41, will run marketing at Chi-X Europe, according
to company spokeswoman Julia Streets. A former journalist,
Keheyan was previously ITG’s London-based head of International
Marketing and worked at the broker for 10 years. Haynes,
previously London-based CEO of  ITG ’s international business, was
named CEO of Chi-X Europe in December last year after a decade
at ITG.  
 Chi-X Europe, owned by its users, started in March 2007 and
was the first multilateral trading facility to challenge
traditional European bourses by offering lower fees and faster
trading. It also competes with other MTFs such as Bats Europe
and offers stocks listed on  Deutsche Boerse AG ,  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc  and NYSE Euronext.  
 The MTF overtook NYSE Euronext by value of equities traded
in Europe for the first time on Jan. 19 and also surpassed
Deutsche Boerse by value traded for the month, according to
statistics from the Federation of European Securities Exchanges.
