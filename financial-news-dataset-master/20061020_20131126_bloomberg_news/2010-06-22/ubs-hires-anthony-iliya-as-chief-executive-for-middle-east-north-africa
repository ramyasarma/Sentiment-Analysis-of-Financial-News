             UBS AG, Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said it hired  Anthony Iliya  as chief executive officer for
business in the Middle East and North Africa, replacing Per
Larsson, who left the company in April.  
 Iliya, 56, will start on Aug. 1 and will be based in Dubai,
the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. He
will report to  Alexander Wilmot-Sitwell . Iliya most recently
worked as the head of asset management for Asia Pacific at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong Kong, UBS said.  
 “The Middle East and North Africa region is a key,
strategic growth market for UBS,” Wilmot-Sitwell, CEO of
Europe, Middle East and Africa and co-head of UBS’s investment
bank, said in the statement. Iliya’s “wealth of expertise and
his background will position us well to further deliver the full
strengths and capabilities of the firm and maximize our growth
and profitability in this important region.”  
 UBS in April appointed Chris Niehaus as CEO of the
investment bank in the Middle East and North Africa. Larsson,
who held the chief position for all businesses in the region
since 2008, left to pursue other opportunities, the bank said at
the time.  
 Niehaus will give up his temporary role as group
coordinator for the region when Iliya joins, UBS spokesman
 Dominik von Arx  said today.
