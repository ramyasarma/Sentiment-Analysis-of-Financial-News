             Platinum and palladium are poised to
benefit from China’s move to ease its currency peg to the dollar
as the nation’s rising auto sales drive growing demand for the
precious metals, UBS AG said.  
 The metals used in auto catalysts “stand to benefit from
becoming cheaper in local terms,”  Edel Tully,  London-based
analyst at the bank, wrote in a report. “China is an important
consumer of palladium in particular for auto production, so yuan
appreciation should boost demand.”  
 China’s auto sales rose 48 percent to 13 million vehicles
in 2009, surpassing the U.S. to become the world’s biggest
market, according Moody’s Investors Service. The nation’s annual
auto sales may expand to 28 million vehicles by 2020, more than
twice the size of the U.S. market, American Axle & Manufacturing
Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Richard E. Dauch  said on
June 10.  
 The People’s Bank of China indicated on June 19 it’s
abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the
global crisis to shield exporters. UBS expected the move to be
“one towards a more flexible exchange rate rather than a
significant revaluation of the yuan,” according to the report.  
 The spot price of palladium has jumped 21 percent this year
and traded at $495.13 an ounce at 9:45 a.m. in Singapore.
Platinum has climbed 9 percent this year and last traded at
$1,595.50 an ounce.
