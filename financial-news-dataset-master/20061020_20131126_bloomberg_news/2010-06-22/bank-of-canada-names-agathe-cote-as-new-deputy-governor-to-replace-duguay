             The Bank of Canada named Agathe Cote
as deputy governor, replacing  Pierre Duguay  after he retires
July 29.  
 Cote, who is currently an adviser to Governor  Mark Carney ,
has also served as head of the bank’s research department and
helped draft its monetary policy reports.  
 The bank’s entire governing council that sets interest
rates has changed since Carney was named to replace  David Dodge 
as governor in October 2007. The new group will decide how fast
and how far to keep raising the  benchmark lending rate , after a
June 1 increase to 0.5 percent from a record low 0.25 percent.  
 “Her research has been very good over the years,” said
 Mark Chandler , a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto. Her appointment “is not likely to change the mix.
It’s important they have continuity.”  
 The Ottawa-based central bank made the announcement on its
website today.
