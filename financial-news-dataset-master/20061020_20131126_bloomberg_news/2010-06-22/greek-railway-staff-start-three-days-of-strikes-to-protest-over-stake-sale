             Greece’s national railway workers
are staging three two-hour work stoppages today to protest at
government plans to reform the organization.  
 The Greek government announced June 2 plans to sell 49
percent of the  Trainose  operating unit of Hellenic Railways
Organization SA (OSE) as part of a state-asset sales program
aimed at bringing in 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually for
the next three years to help cut the country’s budget deficit.
OSE has outstanding debts of 10 billion euros.  
 Workers halted intercity and suburban rail services between
7.00 a.m. and 9.00 a.m., today, with further stoppages planned
between 3.00 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. and 10.00 p.m. and midnight, the
organization said today on information screens at its stations.
The action will be repeated tomorrow and on June 24.  
 Railway employees will also join other unions in a 24-hour
general strike called for June 29 to protest at planned changes
to Greece’s pension system and labor rules. Workers staged an
all day-strike on June 10 to protest over the stake sale.  
 OSE will also strike for 24 hours on June 30, along with
catering and tourist industry employees. The suburban rail
network in Athens links the city’s international airport with
Piraeus, the country’s largest port.  
 Greece said yesterday it will pay for board and lodgings
for tourists unable to leave the country because of industrial
action or natural disasters.
