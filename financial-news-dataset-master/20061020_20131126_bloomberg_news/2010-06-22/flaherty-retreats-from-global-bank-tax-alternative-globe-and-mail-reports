             Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  is retreating from his alternative to a global bank tax
because the idea doesn’t have enough support among Group of 20
nations, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 Flaherty has proposed a contingent capital alternative
where banks sell debt that could be converted to equity when
lenders are under stress, the newspaper said.  
 While Flaherty still supports the idea, he said in an
interview after a speech in New York yesterday that the proposal
needs more work and discussion, the Globe reported.
