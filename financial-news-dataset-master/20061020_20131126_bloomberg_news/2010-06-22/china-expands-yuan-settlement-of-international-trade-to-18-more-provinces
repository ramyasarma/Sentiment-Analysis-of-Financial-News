             China today expanded the use of the
yuan for trade settlement to 18 more provinces and cities,
almost one year after introducing the move in five cities.  
 Companies based in Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang
can now use the yuan to pay for cross-border transactions,
according to a  statement  on the website of the  People’s Bank of
China . Companies in Shanghai and four cities in Guangdong have
been using the local currency for international trade since July
last year.  
 The central bank’s move, the second currency-related
measure unveiled in four days, reflects its intent to reduce
reliance on the U.S.  dollar . China on June 19 scrapped the
yuan’s two-year peg to the dollar, a measure aimed at deflecting
criticism from its trading partners. Trade settlement using the
yuan totaled 18.4 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) in the first
quarter, five times more than the amount in the second half of
last year, the central bank said on May 10.  
 The yuan declined 0.34 percent to 6.8204 per dollar as of
1:41 p.m. in Shanghai, the biggest loss since December 2008,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade system. The 12-
month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to 6.6350,
after the central bank set the reference rate 0.43 percent
higher.  
 The municipalities that will be able to use yuan for trade
settlement include Tianjin and Chongqing, while the provinces
include Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Fujian,
Sichuan, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Hubei, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Guangxi
and Tibet. The settlement program will be expanded to the entire
Guangdong province from four cities now, the statement also
said.
