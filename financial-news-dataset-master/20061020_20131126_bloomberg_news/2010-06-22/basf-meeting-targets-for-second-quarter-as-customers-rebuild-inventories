             BASF SE , the world’s biggest
chemical company, is meeting targets set for the second quarter,
helped by customers replenishing inventories, according to board
member  Martin Brudermueller .  
 “In the first quarter, all regions performed surprisingly
well, better than we had anticipated,”  Brudermueller  told
reporters in Frankenthal, Germany today. “The trend is
continuing in the second quarter, which is performing according
to our forecasts.”  
 Brudermueller, who is responsible for Asian operations as
well as plastics, foresees China helping BASF grow faster than
competitors, as the company is focusing investment and research
activities to the region.  
 BASF is sticking to full-year goals for a “considerable”
improvement in earnings and earnings its cost of capital. Growth
will be tempered when restocking ends and the company faces
comparisons with stronger quarters in 2009, the executive said.
