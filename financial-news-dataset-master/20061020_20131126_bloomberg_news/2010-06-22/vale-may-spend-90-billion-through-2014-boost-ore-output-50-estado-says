             Vale SA , the world’s largest 
iron-ore producer, plans to invest about $90 billion through 
2014, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, without saying where it 
obtained the information.  
 Vale will spend about 70 percent of that amount in Brazil 
and $40 billion in new iron-ore projects, the newspaper said. 
The company plans to increase output to 450 million metric tons
per year by 2014 from 300 million metric tons, Estado said.   
 Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli  declined to confirm 
the amount because the investment plan isn’t yet final, Estado 
said. He told the newspaper the company will invest in mines, 
railways and ports and doesn’t plan to buy new mines.
