             Swiss stocks  fell the most in more
than two weeks amid concern the recent rally has outpaced
prospects for the economy.  
 Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the world’s largest jewelry
maker, and ABB Ltd., the biggest builder of power-transmission
networks, retreated more than 1.9 percent, pacing a drop in
stocks sensitive to growth. Credit Suisse Group AG led a decline
among financial shares.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  dropped 65.11, or 1
percent, to 6,454.46 at 2:51 p.m. in Zurich, paring yesterday’s
1.1 percent gain. The gauge of the largest and most actively
traded companies has slumped 7.4 percent from this year’s high
on April 15 amid concern that European nations will have
difficulties reducing their budget deficits without harming the
economic recovery. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  also
declined 1 percent today.  
 Richemont declined 1.9 percent to 42.28 Swiss francs.  ABB 
fell 2.2 percent to 20.93 francs. Holcim Ltd., the world’s
second-biggest cement maker, dropped 1 percent to 78.65 francs,
paring two days of gains.  
 Credit Suisse lost 3 percent to 44.95 francs, reversing
yesterday’s advance.  UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank, dropped
1.4 percent to 15.79 euros, the first decline in two weeks.
European  banking shares  lost as much as 2.4 percent today, among
the worst performers in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as Fitch
ratings cut its credit rating on BNP Paribas SA.  
 Syngenta Slips  
 Syngenta AG  dropped 0.8 percent to 266 francs as the
world’s biggest maker of agriculture chemicals faces an in-depth
investigation from the European Union over its plan to buy
Monsanto Co.’s hybrid sunflower-seed business. The European
Commission said in a statement today it will rule on the
transaction by Oct. 26.  
 “The sunflower-seed industry has undergone important
consolidation over the past years and the commission needs to
ensure that effective competition is preserved, to maintain
innovation and prevent that input prices for farmers rise,” EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said.  
 Swiss exports increased in May, adding to signs the economy
is gathering strength. Exports, adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, gained 1.1 percent from April, when they rose a
revised 2.9 percent, the Federal Customs Office in Bern said.
Watch exports rose 13 percent, the Federal Customs Office said.  
 German business confidence unexpectedly rose to a two-year
high in June as the euro’s depreciation and a global economic
recovery brightened the outlook for exports. The Ifo institute
in Munich said its business climate index, based on a survey of
7,000 executives, increased to 101.8 from 101.5 in May.
Economists had expected a decline to 101.2, according to the
median of 38 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
