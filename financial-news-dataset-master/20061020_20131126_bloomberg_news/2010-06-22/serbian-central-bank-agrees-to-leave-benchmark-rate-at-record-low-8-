             Serbia’s central bank left the two-
week  repurchase rate  at a record-low 8 percent as policy makers
assess the impact of a declining dinar on inflation.  
 The Belgrade-based  Narodna Banka Srbije , which has reduced
the benchmark rate 11 times since it peaked in late 2008 at
17.75 percent, announced the decision today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Serbia’s  inflation rate  fell to 3.8 percent in May from 4
percent the previous month.  Radovan Jelasic , the outgoing
central bank governor, warned last month that the dinar’s
decline is close to a point where it may spur inflation.  
 The Balkan nation’s central bank sold 20 million euros
($24.6 million) yesterday to ease the daily volatility of the
currency, which has lost 7.6 percent of its value against the
euro this year, according to Bloomberg data.
