             Argentina beat Greece 2-0 to advance
to the round of 16 at the World Cup in South Africa. South Korea
also progressed with a 2-2 tie against Nigeria.  
 Argentina finished atop Group B with nine points and South
Korea was second with four points. The top two in each of the
eight groups qualify for the next round.  
 Earlier today, Uruguay defeated Mexico 1-0, allowing both
teams to progress from Group A. Host South Africa beat 10-man
France 2-1 as both were eliminated.  
 Martin Demichelis  and  Martin Palermo  scored in the final 13
minutes in Polokwane to give Argentina its third straight
victory. Argentina will play Mexico in its next game on June 27.  
 Lee Jung Soo and Park Chu Young scored in Durban for South
Korea, which meets Uruguay on June 26.  
 Nigeria took the lead in the 12th minute on a goal by Kalu
Uche and Lee tied the game seven minutes before halftime. Park
scored with a free kick early in the second half to give South
Korea a 2-1 lead.  
 Nigeria’s Ayegbeni Yakubu missed a wide-open goal from
three yards out in the 67th minute. He scored two minutes later
with a penalty kick after Chinedu Ogbuke Obasi fouled Kim Nam
Il.  
 Teams are ranked in each group by points from group
matches, followed by goal difference and goals scored in all
group matches. Ultimately, world governing body FIFA can decide
which team moves on by drawing lots.
