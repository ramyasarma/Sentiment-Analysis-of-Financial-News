             Cotton prices declined as favorable
crop conditions in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may
boost supplies, and as global equities tumbled. Orange-juice
futures dropped for the second straight session.  
 The MSCI World Index of stocks in 24 developed nations
headed for the first drop in 11 sessions. Cotton may be falling
amid uncertainty on the economic recovery, said  Keith Brown , the
president of Keith Brown & Co. As of June 20, 62 percent of the
U.S. crop was in good to excellent condition, versus 44 percent
a year ago, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday.  
 “The crop’s off to a better-than-an-OK start,” Brown said
from his brokerage in Moultrie, Georgia. “At least for now,
that may be weighing on the market.”  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 0.39 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 78.78 cents a pound at 9:22 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Before today, the fiber gained 4.7 percent this
year.  
 U.S. output will be 16.7 million bales in the year that
begins Aug. 1, up 37 percent from an estimated 12.2 million in
the current season, according to the USDA. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery dropped 0.65
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.4175 a pound in New York. Through
yesterday, the commodity advanced 10 percent this year.
