             Japanese bonds rose, pushing 10-year
 yields  to the lowest level since December 2008, as signs the
global economic recovery is faltering boosted demand for
government debt.  
 Benchmark bonds advanced for a second day as Asian stocks
extended a global decline in equities before a report that
economists said will show U.S. home sales slumped the most in 16
years. Bond futures climbed to a two-week high after the
government said yesterday it aimed to balance its books within
10 years, restrict debt sales and overhaul the tax system.  
 “It’s just a matter of time before we see economies around
the world slow as nations focus on austerity,” said  Koji Ochiai ,
chief market economist in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors Securities
Co., a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank. “Yields now seem
likely to drop further than I previously expected.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 fell two
basis points to 1.17 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.180 yen to 101.161 yen. The yield dropped to
1.160 percent, the lowest since Dec. 30, 2008.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.10 to
140.92 at the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They
earlier rose to 141.05, the highest for a benchmark contract
since June 9. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 1.9 percent.  
 Ten-year yields may drop to 1.10 percent by the end of
September, Mizuho’s Ochiai said. If his forecast proves accurate,
investors who bought the securities today would make a 0.9
percent return, Bloomberg calculations show.  
 Slowing Recovery  
 Sales of U.S. new homes declined 19 percent to an annual
pace of 410,000 in May, the biggest drop since January 1994,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before today’s report.
Purchases of U.S. existing houses fell 2.2 percent to a 5.66
million rate last month, the National Association of Realtors
said yesterday.  
 The Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate
in a range between zero and 0.25 percent at a two-day policy
meeting ending today, according to all 97 economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey.  
 Bonds extended gains from yesterday when the government
said Japan would cap annual spending at 71 trillion yen ($785
billion) over the next three years.  
 “The government is at least tackling fiscal issues, which
is an improvement after avoiding talk of fiscal rehabilitation
and a consumption tax increase,” said  Naomi Hasegawa , a senior
debt strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest lender by assets.
“That should give some confidence to bond investors.”  
 The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.6 trillion yen of two-
year notes tomorrow. The previous two-year auction in May drew
bids for 3.68 times the amount on offer, down from a so-called
bid-to-cover ratio of 4.73 in April.  
 Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a return of
1.5 this year, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.
