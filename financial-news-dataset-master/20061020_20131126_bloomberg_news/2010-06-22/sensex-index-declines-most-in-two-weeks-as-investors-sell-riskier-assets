             India’s stocks fell the most in two
weeks as investors withdrew funds from riskier assets after
Fitch Ratings downgraded Paris-based BNP Paribas SA and Standard
& Poor’s Rating Services said Spanish lenders face difficulty.  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and
zinc producer, dropped 2.3 percent after raw material prices
declined. Wipro Ltd., a software-services exporter that gets a
fifth of its sales in Europe, slid the most in almost a month.
Fitch cut its long-term credit-rating on BNP Paribas, France’s
largest bank, while Standard & Poor’s slashed Spain’s economic
growth forecast.  
 “The euro zone is still a concern,” said  Ambareesh Baliga ,
vice president of equities at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.
“There is no tearing hurry to buy right away as valuations are
getting stretched.” He advises investors to avoid shares in
metal companies.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 126.86, or 0.7 percent, to 17,749.69, its steepest decline

since May 25. Larger rival  Infosys Techologies Ltd. , which also
gets about a fifth of its sales in Europe, lost 1.2 percent to

 Fitch cited a “deterioration” of BNP Paribas’s asset
quality for its one step cut to AA-. Standard & Poor’s lowered
Spain’s economic growth forecast to an average 0.7 percent a
year through 2016 from 1 percent, saying the country’s banks
face mounting credit losses and “substantial strain” on
revenue generation.  
 India’s Sensex climbed 5.5 percent this month through
