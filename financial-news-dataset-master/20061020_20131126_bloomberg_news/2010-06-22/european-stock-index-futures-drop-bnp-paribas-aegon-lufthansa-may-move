             European stocks  fell on speculation
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s longest rally in 11 months has
outpaced prospects for company earnings and economic growth.  
 BNP Paribas SA  slid 1.6 percent as Fitch Ratings cut the
credit rating for France’s largest bank. Aegon NV slipped 2.8
percent after saying it may consider selling its life
reinsurance unit as it seeks to boost earnings. Chemring Group
Plc sank 6 percent after profit declined.  
 The  Stoxx 600  retreated 0.5 percent to 256.92, ending a
nine-day surge that extended the advance from this year’s low on
May 25 to 11 percent. The measure is still 5.6 percent below the
April 15 high amid concern economic growth will be hampered as
European nations try to cut their budget deficits.  
 “The markets remain nervous about the risks to growth and
the wildly optimistic earnings expectations in some sectors,”
said  Chirin Gill , a London-based fund manager at Daiwa SB
Investments, which oversees $60 billion.  
 National benchmark indexes declined in all of the 18
western European markets, except Iceland. France’s CAC 40
dropped 0.8 percent and Germany’s DAX slipped 0.4 percent.  
 The U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1 percent as Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  unveiled a levy on banks and an
increase in sales tax in an emergency budget that seeks to guard
the top credit rating without strangling economic recovery.  
 U.K. Budget  
 Forecasting growth of 1.2 percent this year and 2.3 percent
in 2011, Osborne said he will tax bank balance sheets starting
next year to generate 2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) of annual
revenue. The value-added tax rate will rise to 20 percent in
January from 17.5 percent.  
 European stocks extended declines after a report showed
sales of U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in May, a
sign demand was probably pulled into prior months before a June
tax-credit deadline. Purchases decreased 2.2 percent to a 5.66
million annual rate, according to figures from the National
Association of Realtors.  
 BNP Paribas  fell 1.9 percent to 49.36 euros. The bank had
its credit rating cut by Fitch, which cited a “deterioration”
of the company’s asset quality. The long-term rating was reduced
one step to AA-, the fourth-highest investment grade, from AA,
Fitch said late yesterday.  
 Societe Generale SA, France’s second-biggest bank by market
value, fell 4 percent to 37.35 euros. Credit Agricole SA, the
largest bank by branches, slid 4.7 percent to 9.49 euros.  
 Aegon, Chemring  
 Aegon dropped 2.8 percent to 4.96 euros. The Dutch owner of
U.S. insurer Transamerica Corp. said it will explore strategic
options for its life reinsurance business, including identifying
a suitable buyer. The company plans to cut costs at its U.K.
business by 25 percent by the end of 2011.  
 Chemring slumped 6 percent to 3,111 pence. The U.K.
developer of missile-avoidance gear for the U.S.’s Joint Strike
Fighter reported first-half net income fell to 18.4 million
pounds from 21.5 million pounds.  
 Carnival Plc tumbled 5 percent to 2,424 pence, the biggest
drop this month. The cruise ship operator said third-quarter
earnings will be as low as $1.43 per share. Analysts on average
forecast earnings of $1.51 per share, according to a survey by
Bloomberg.  
 BP Slides  
 BP Plc dropped 4.4 percent to 334.2 pence, the lowest close
in six years after adjusting for dividends, on concern the
company’s oil spill cleanup operation in the Gulf of Mexico may
be disrupted by bad weather. The first storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season may enter the Gulf of Mexico as soon as next
week, meteorologist  Jim Rouiller  said, and forecasters are
predicting the season may be among the worst on record.  
 U.K. homebuilders rallied after the U.K. budget raised the
capital gains tax rate by less than analysts and investors had
anticipated. Barratt Developments Plc climbed 4.4 percent to
108.4 pence. Redrow Plc gained 3.2 percent to 127 pence.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group
Plc reversed earlier losses, rising 0.7 percent to 47.08 pence
and 4.1 percent to 59 pence, respectively, after Osborne
announced a levy on U.K. banks in the budget.  
 “We recommend being long of Lloyds in particular now that
the levy appears to be less onerous than the bear case
expectation,” analyst  Andrew Lim  at Matrix Corporate Capital
LLP in London wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  
 Whitbread Plc  gained 3.6 percent to 1,531 pence. The U.K.
operator of the Costa Coffee chain said fiscal first-quarter
sales at outlets open at least a year rose 7.6 percent, led by
its Premier Inn budget-hotel chain.
