             The ruble weakened the most in two
weeks against the dollar as oil declined for the first time in
three days on renewed concern Europe’s debt problems will slow
the global economic recovery.  
 Russia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 30.9050 per
dollar in Moscow trading, its sharpest retreat since June 8. The
benchmark sovereign dollar bonds due April 2020 fell, pushing
the yield 5 basis point higher to 5.37 percent, the first
increase in four days.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export, earlier declined as much
as 1.7 percent to $76.53 a barrel in New York as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its forecasts for crude, saying commodity markets
are “fragile” on concern growth in Europe and China will slow.
Optimism faded that China’s plan to add more flexibility in the
yuan’s fixed exchange rate would strengthen the global economic
recovery.  
 “The rain is back,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at
UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, wrote in a research note
today. Investors “are again more focused on Europe’s solvency
issues and the threat to global growth.”  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.0863 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
30.9740 on June 21. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble gained 0.2 percent to 38.0300 per euro, its
strongest close since June 9. The movements against the dollar
and the euro left the ruble at 34.0878 against the central
bank’s  target  currency basket, which it uses to manage swings
that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
