             The yen rallied against all 16 of
its most-traded peers after existing-home sales in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell in May, spurring speculation growth may be
slowing in the world’s largest economy.  
 “It’s just seems it’s a bit of a disappointment,” said
 Brian Kim , a currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut. “People were looking at a little bit of a pullback
in the risk rally yesterday afternoon in equities, and we
haven’t had the strong follow-through in risk, so that’s giving
the yen a bit more comfort.”  
 The yen rose 0.6 percent to 90.57 per dollar at 10:23 a.m.
in New York, from 91.11 yesterday. It advanced 0.9 percent to
111.12 per euro.  
 Purchases  of previously owned homes, which are tabulated
when a contract closes, decreased 2.2 percent to a 5.66 million
annual rate, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed today in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a rise to a 6.12 million pace.
