             Brazil plans to sell more of its
dollar bonds due in 2021 and 2041 this year, Deputy Treasury
Secretary  Paulo Valle  said.  
 The government will tap international debt markets if
conditions remain favorable, Valle told reporters in New York
today.  
 “In the last weeks, it already improved a lot,” Valle
said.  
 The yield on Brazil’s $788 million of 4.875 percent bonds
due in 2021 has dropped 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage
point, this month to 4.94 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. Brazil, which sold the securities in April, plans to
increase the size of the issue to at least $1.5 billion, Valle
said.  
 The country’s $1.28 billion of 5.625 percent notes due in
2041 yield 5.73 percent, down 16 this month. Brazil sold the
bonds in September.
