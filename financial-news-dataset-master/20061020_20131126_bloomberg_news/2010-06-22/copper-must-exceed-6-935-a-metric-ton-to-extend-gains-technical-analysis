             Copper must climb above $6,935 a
metric ton to extend gains, according to technical analysis
by Barclays Capital.  
 That price marks the 200-day moving average, analysts
including London-based  Phil Roberts  said in a report. Copper is
5 percent below that level. The attached chart shows the advance
ended this month when London Metal Exchange prices slid to
$6,037.50 a ton on June 7, the lowest intraday level since
October, according to the bank.  
 “Bulls need a break of the 200-day to indicate a greater
base and turn higher,” the analysts said. Copper may slide as
low as $5,818 a ton, a level last seen in October, they said.  
 Copper for three-month delivery fell $18, or 0.3 percent,
to $6,585 a ton at 7:01 a.m. on the LME. The contract yesterday
gained 2.6 percent, the most in a week. The metal, used in
electrical equipment and construction, is down 11 percent this
year.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A moving average is a technical
analysis indicator that shows a commodity’s average value over a
specified time period.
