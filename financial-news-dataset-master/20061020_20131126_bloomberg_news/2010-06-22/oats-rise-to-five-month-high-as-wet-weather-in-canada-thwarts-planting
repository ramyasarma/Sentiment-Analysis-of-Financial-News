             Oats rose to the highest in five
months as unusually wet weather in Canada, the second-biggest
producer of the grain, thwarted planting and slowed crop
development.  
 Heavy rains “maintained high levels of soil moisture”
across much of the southern Prairies, the Canadian Wheat Board
said in a report yesterday. Crops seeded after yesterday
probably will not reach maturity before the first frost, the CWB
said. Oats have surged 46 percent this month.  
 “The historic wet weather in Canada continues, and the
longer it does, the more damage that is done to yields,” said
Shawn Hackett, the president of Hackett Financial Advisors in
Boynton Beach, Florida. “The crop could be one of the worst in
recent history. As a result, the oats market is in the process
of rationing demand to allow that what does get harvested can
cover demand until next year’s crop cycle.”  
 Oat futures for July delivery rose 10.75 cents, or 4
percent, to $2.79 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price for the most-active contract since Jan. 11. Oats
have gained for three straight sessions.  
 Russia is the world’s biggest oats producer.
