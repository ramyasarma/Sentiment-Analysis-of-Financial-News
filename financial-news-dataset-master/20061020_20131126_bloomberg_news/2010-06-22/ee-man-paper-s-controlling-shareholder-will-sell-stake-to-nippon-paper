             Lee & Man Paper Manufacturing Ltd. 
said its controlling shareholder, Gold Best Holdings Ltd.,
agreed to sell a 12 percent stake to  Nippon Paper Group Inc.  for
HK$3.55 billion ($456 million).  
 Gold Best will sell Nippon Paper 546 million shares at
HK$6.50 each, Lee & Man said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange today. Nippon and Lee & Man will pursue joint business
interests, it said.  
 Lee & Man, the 10th-best performer this year on the 56-
member  Bloomberg World Forest Products & Paper Index , fell 3.9
percent to close at HK$6.43 in Hong Kong, after rising to an
intraday high of 2.4 percent. The stock has gained 20 percent
this year, compared with a 4.8 percent decline in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  
 Shares of Nippon Paper declined 1.3 percent to close at
2,587 yen in Tokyo, where it is based. The Japanese papermaker
said in a statement its investment in Lee & Man will extend its
reach in China and Asia, building on previous deals with
Taiwanese, Thai, and Australian rivals.  
 Lee & Man’s net income for the year ended March 31 rose
six-fold to HK$1.83 billion, and sales gained 15 percent to
HK$11.09 billion, the company said yesterday. Based in Hong Kong,
Lee & Man is the second-largest Chinese maker of linerboard,
Nippon Paper said.  
 Gold Best’s 63 percent stake in Lee & Man will be cut to 51
percent upon completion of the sale to Nippon Paper, the Hong
Kong company said.
