             Apple Inc.  said it sold 3 million
iPads in the 80 days since the device went on the sale in the
U.S., adding to evidence Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs is
building demand for tablet-style computers.  
 Software developers have created more than 11,000
applications for the iPad since its April 3 debut, Cupertino,
California-based Apple also said today in a statement.  
 The iPad has emerged as the first tablet computer with
mainstream appeal, carving out a new product category between
smartphones and notebook computers. Today’s results led many
analysts to increase their sales targets for the iPad, signaling
that Apple is succeeding where predecessors such as  Microsoft
Corp.  faltered.  
 “That’s a huge number -- it’s amazing,” said  Shaw Wu , an
analyst with Kaufman Brothers LP in San Francisco, who raised
his 2010 sales estimate 21 percent to 9.7 million units.
“People continuously underestimate how well this product is
selling.”  
 Apple  rose  $3.68, or 1.4 percent, to $273.85 in New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained
30 percent this year.  
 Wu  advises  buying Apple shares and doesn’t own any himself.  
 The iPad lets users read digital books, surf the Web, watch
videos and play games. In April, the company delayed its
international debut by a month after shipping more than 500,000
domestically in a week.  
 Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has tried for more
than a decade to build a market for tablet computers.  
 Sales Projections  
 Abhey Lamba , an analyst with ISI Group in New York, raised
his iPad sales estimate today by 27 percent. He expects Apple to
sell 6.6 million units this fiscal year ending in September, up
from a previous prediction of 5.2 million. The iPod took
2 1/2 years to sell 3 million units while the iPhone took three
quarters, Lamba said in an e-mail.  
 Maynard Um , an analyst at UBS AG in New York, boosted his
fiscal 2010 projection by 42 percent to 6.8 million units.  
 For the calendar year, Standard & Poor’s analyst Clyde
Montevirgen in New York increased his estimate to 9 million
iPads, up 13 percent.  
 The rate of sales is also increasing, according to  Colin Gillis , senior analyst with BGC Partners LP in New York. Apple
sold 45,500 iPads a day from May 31 to June 21, up from 33,000 a
day in the period when the second million were sold, he said.
The sales are exceeding his expectations, he said.  
 App Appeal  
 “The appeal of the App Store has really led to greater-
than-expected sales,” said  William Kreher , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co. in St. Louis who  recommends  buying the shares.
“Apple’s ecosystem continues to grow with each day.”  
 The tablet adds a new  product line  to Apple, which also
makes Macintosh computers, iPod music players and iPhones.  
 The company is due to release the next iteration of its
iPhone on June 24. Apple had more than 600,000 preorders for the
iPhone 4, overloading the company’s computer system and leading
carrier AT&T Inc. to suspend sales before this week’s debut.
