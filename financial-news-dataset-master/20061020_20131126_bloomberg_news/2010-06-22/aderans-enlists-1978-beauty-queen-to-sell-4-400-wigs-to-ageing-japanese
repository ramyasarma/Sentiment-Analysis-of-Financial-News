             Aderans Holdings Co. , Japan’s
largest wigmaker, plans to expand its network of luxury female
wig stores sixfold as the nation’s growing elderly population
spurs demand.  
 The Tokyo-based company aims to have 300 Fontaine Couture
brand stores by 2013, up from 50, Chief Executive Officer  Tadao Otsuki  said in a June 18 interview. A television advertising
campaign featuring actress and former Miss Universe contestant
 Hisako Manda  helped the upscale stores increase customers 20
percent last year, bucking the recession, he said.  
 The expansion of its female wig stores and increased focus
on marketing are part of efforts to turn around the company
that’s  forecasting  its third straight net loss this year. Almost
23 percent of  Japan’s  127 million people are 65 years or older,
according to government data.  
 “We provide a comfortable atmosphere for women who
hesitate to try wigs in public,” said Noboru Kusama, an Aderans
spokesman. Unlike men who wear a single hairpiece daily to hide
baldness, female clients buy them more as a fashion accessory,
he said.  
 Aderans  advanced  0.8 percent to 1,121 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Topix index
fell 1.5 percent.  
 $4,400 Wigs  
 Fontaine Couture’s order-made wigs, like those  modeled  by
Manda, a 1978 Miss Universe contestant, cost 400,000 yen
($4,400) to 500,000 yen on average, Kusama said. That’s as much
as 13 times more expensive than off-the-shelf hairpieces,
according to the company.  
 The luxury outlets, usually located in malls and department
stores, are similar to beauty salons with private fitting rooms,
Kusama said.  
 Aderans doesn’t break out sales of its upscale Fontaine
Couture brand from its Fontaine division, which also includes
sales of less expensive lines. Fontaine sales account for about
16 percent of Aderans’s revenue, according to  company data .  
 Even as Fontaine Couture attracted new clients last year,
the Fontaine division’s sales fell 9.3 percent, or about half
the pace of its Japanese businesses overall, to 9.7 billion yen.  
 “Aderans is focusing on Fontaine as a domestic growth
driver,”  Hidekatsu Watanabe , a Mizuho Securities Co. analyst,
wrote in a June 10 report. “But I can’t see a sign of
recovery.” Watanabe rates the company’s stock “underperform.”  
 Wigs sold to women account for 64 percent of Japan sales by
revenue at Aderans, which also runs a namesake chain of stores
aimed at men, and offers hair transplant services for men and
women through its  Bosley  chain in North America.  
 Aderans aims to increase female wig sales in Japan by 26
percent to 30.8 billion yen by fiscal 2012 from 24.4 billion yen
last year. The company forecasts a net loss of 4.9 billion yen
in the year ending February, compared with a loss of 9.85
billion yen last year.  
 Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore) LP  is the
largest shareholder of Aderans with 27.74 percent stake,
according to Bloomberg data. The fund has been investing in the
wigmaker since 2004.
