             Japan will cooperate with Vietnam to
promote use of its high-speed train technology if the Vietnamese
government revives its plan to build a nationwide high-speed
railroad network, Transport Minister  Seiji Maehara  said.  
 “We’ll continue to work with the Vietnamese government to
have Japan’s high-speed train technology employed,” Maehara
told reporters at a briefing in Tokyo today. Japan will also
continue to explore ways to fund the project, he said.  
 Vietnam’s National Assembly on June 19 rejected the
proposed $56 billion high-speed railway on concerns about paying
for a project costing about 60 percent of economic output.  
 “The government and the Ministry of Transport will study a
comprehensive master plan for the country’s transport system,”
 Dang Vu Minh , chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee on
Science, Technology and Environment, said by phone yesterday.  
 Vietnam Railways Corp. was planning to use Japanese
technology to build the high-speed train line,  Nguyen Huu Bang ,
the company’s chairman, said in February. Japan was exploring
ways to help fund the project, Maehara said in April.  
 Sumitomo Corp.  had teamed with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd.  to bid on the project. Itochu Corp. was heading a competing
group with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.
