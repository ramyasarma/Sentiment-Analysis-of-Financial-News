Tokyo. The following are among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.

percent to 114,700 yen. The real-estate-investment trust will
sell new shares to the public for 113,684 yen ($1,249) each,

limit of 10,000 yen, or 15 percent, to 55,400 yen, the lowest
since at least March 2003. The wind-power developer said
President  Masayuki Tsukawaki ’s stake in Japan Wind was reduced
to 6.27 percent from 10.99 percent as his security on loan was
sold by financial institutions in terms of an acceleration
clause. Tsukawaki is no longer the largest shareholder of Japan
Wind, it said in a release.  
 JVC Kenwood Holdings Inc. (6632 JT) fell 2.5 percent to 39
yen. Japan’s Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission
recommended the government impose fines on JVC Kenwood and its
Victor unit for falsifying financial statements.  
 Leopalace21 Corp.  (8848 JT) advanced 4.1 percent to 329 yen.

“hold” by  Takeshi Fujita , a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG.  
 Net One Systems Co. (7518 JT) jumped 5.3 percent to 132,100
yen. The communications-network designer has signed a contract
with SeaMicro Inc., a California-based start-up, to start
selling Internet servers that run Intel Corp.’s 512 Atom
microprocessors from next month. Net One aims to generate 3
billion yen ($33 million) in sales of the new server over three
years, it said in a release dated yesterday on its Web site.  
 Nihon Inter Electronics Corp. (6974 JT) tumbled 11 percent
to 153 yen. The maker of semiconductor devices said it has
doubts about its viability, as its liabilities exceeded assets
by 4.74 billion yen at the end of March. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange will move the company’s shares to the bourse’s second
section from the first section as of Aug. 1, Nihon Inter
separately said in a release.  
 Nisshin Fudosan Co.  (8881 JT) sank 5 percent to 652 yen,

estate company will aid  Tada Corp.  (1843 JP), a condominium
builder under court-led rehabilitation, and make it a subsidiary
through a stock purchase. Nisshin Fudosan raised its full-year

yen.

reported.  
 Yamada Denki Co.  (9831 JT) rose 1.7 percent to 6,160 yen.
