             The U.K. will sell 165 billion
pounds of bonds in the fiscal year ending March 31 as the
nation’s new government cuts government spending.  
 The new issuance figure is an 28 percent drop from last
year’s level, and matches the median forecast of 15 financial
instituions in a Bloomberg survey.
