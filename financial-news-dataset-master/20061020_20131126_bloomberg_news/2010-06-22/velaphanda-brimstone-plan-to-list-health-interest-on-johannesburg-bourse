             Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. and Brimstone
Investment Corp. Ltd. plan to list their health interests in a
separate entity on the JSE Ltd.’s Johannesburg Securities
Exchange.  
 Brimstone will dispose of its entire indirect shareholding
in Life Healthcare Group Holdings Ltd. in exchange for a stake
in a new listed entity to be known as Health, which will be
listed on or about Aug. 16. The only asset of the listing
following a restructuring of Brimstone and Mvelaphanda’s assets
will be a 26.6 percent direct holding in Life Healthcare.
