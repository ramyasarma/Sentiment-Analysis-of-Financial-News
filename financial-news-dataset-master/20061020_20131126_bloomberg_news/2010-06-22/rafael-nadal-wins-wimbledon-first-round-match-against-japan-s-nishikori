             Rafael Nadal, playing his first
match at Wimbledon since winning the title in 2008, beat Japan’s
Kei Nishikori in straight sets in the opening round of the
tournament today.  
 The Spaniard, who missed the grass court Grand Slam last
year with a knee injury, won 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 on Centre Court at
the All England Club.  
 Nadal, winner of his seventh Grand Slam title earlier this
month at the French Open, is the top-ranked player on the ATP
Tour, but is seeded No. 2 at Wimbledon.
