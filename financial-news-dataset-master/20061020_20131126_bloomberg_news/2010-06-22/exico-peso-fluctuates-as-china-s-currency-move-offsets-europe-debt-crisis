             Mexico’s peso fluctuated between
gains and losses as China’s move to relax the yuan’s fixed rate
to the dollar was offset by concern the European debt crisis
will slow the economic recovery.  
 The currency was little changed at 12.5253 per dollar at
9:29 a.m. New York time, from 12.5351 yesterday. The peso has
gained 4.5 percent this year against the dollar, the best
performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “The yuan decision improved the outlook for Mexican
exports,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at Banco Ve Por
Mas SA in Mexico City. “The news out of Europe is offsetting
any good news, because the recovery on that continent is still
unclear.”  
 The U.K. announced it will levy taxes on banks and raise
the sales tax, as it deals with the biggest budget cuts in a
generation to preserve a credit rating and close a budget
deficit.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.28 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.15 centavo to 124.26 centavos per peso.
