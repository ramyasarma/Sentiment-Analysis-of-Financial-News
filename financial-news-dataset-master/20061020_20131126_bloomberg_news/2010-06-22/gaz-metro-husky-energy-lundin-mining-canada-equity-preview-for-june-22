             Canadian stocks  fell, led by energy
producers, banks and railroads, after an unexpected decline in
resales of U.S. homes raised concern that the economic rebound
in Canada’s biggest trade partner is losing steam.  
 Canadian National Railway Co., the country’s biggest
railroad, lost 2.9 percent after the report from the National
Association of Realtors. Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest
oil and gas company, declined 2.4 percent as fuels retreated.
Biovail Corp. jumped 13 percent, surging for a second day after
announcing a merger with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  fell 138.14
points, or 1.2 percent, the most in two weeks, to 11,797.94.  
 “Housing is a major problem in the States,” said  Blair Falconer , who manages C$800 million ($784 million) as a
portfolio manager at HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. in Toronto.
“It was a very, very poor number. It means the U.S. consumer is
probably under more pressure than people thought.”  
 The S&P/TSX rallied 4.2 percent from June 9 to yesterday as
oil surged 4.6 percent and copper 3.8 percent. U.S. consumer
confidence and factory production, as well as Chinese exports,
increased faster than most economists forecast, according to
data released during that period.  
 The U.S. accounted for 75 percent of Canada’s exports last
year, according to  Statistics Canada .  
 Missing Forecast  
 Purchases of existing homes in the U.S. fell 2.2 percent
last month to a 5.66 million annual rate. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast an increase to a 6.12 million
rate, based on the median estimate. The drop in home resales
indicated the U.S. housing market may slump more after a tax
credit expires at the end of this month.  
 “There should have been a whole bunch of closings coming
to fruition from that tax rebate,” Falconer said.  
 Natural gas decreased for a third day, losing 2.4 percent
as forecasts indicated milder weather in the U.S. Crude oil
slipped 0.8 percent to $77.21 a barrel after a U.S. judge lifted
the Obama administration’s six-month moratorium on deepwater
drilling.  
 Energy shares fell 1.9 percent as a group, contributing the
most to the S&P/TSX’s decline. Suncor fell 2.4 percent to
C$33.73. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, dropped 2.9 percent to
C$36.87.  EnCana Corp. , Canada’s biggest natural gas producer,
declined 3.1 percent to C$34.16.  
 Railroads  
 CN Rail lost 2.9 percent to C$62.35 as North American
railroads retreated. CN, which rose to a record yesterday, got
 33 percent  of its revenue from the U.S. last year. Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd., Canada’s other Class I railroad, decreased
2.8 percent to C$60.46.  
 The S&P/TSX Bank Index retreated the most in nine days as
 all eight  Canadian publicly traded lenders fell.  
 Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest bank, dropped
1.1 percent to C$54.41. Toronto-Dominion Bank, its largest
domestic rival, declined 0.9 percent to C$73. Quebec regional
lender Laurentian Bank of Canada slumped 3.1 percent to C$44.  
 Biovail soared 13 percent to C$19.25, its highest level
since August 2007, after rallying 14 percent yesterday. Analyst
 Annabel Samimy  of Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. told clients
today the merger “Accelerates growth, expands geographic scale,
diversifies revenues and generates cost synergies.”  
 Magna International Inc., Canada’s largest auto-parts
maker, climbed 2.1 percent to C$70.72. The Globe and Mail
reported that most shareholders who have voted early have
supported the plan to buy out founder  Frank Stronach ’s
controlling stake for $863 million.  
 Copper producer Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. tumbled 6.9 percent
to C$10.54 after cutting its production forecast on June 19.
Analyst  John F. Hughes  of Desjardins Securities today lowered
his 12-month price estimate on the company to C$20.35 from
C$21.55.
