             LinkedIn Corp. will use acquisitions
to make its professional networking tools more accessible on
mobile phones and add features that make the site more relevant
to members, Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Weiner  said.  
 Weiner wants to make LinkedIn, which helps users hunt for
jobs and recruit new employees, a site where white-collar
workers can also carry out such tasks as researching companies
and prospecting for deals. The company, which boasts more than
70 million members, has yet to make its first acquisition.  
 “We want you to be great at the job you’re already in,”
Weiner said in an interview.  
 LinkedIn  also plans to boost its staff by half to 900 by
year’s end, in part to help it cope with rapid growth in India,
Brazil and China, Weiner said.  
 Weiner, 40, joined LinkedIn in December 2008 and became CEO
in June 2009. The former executive vice president at Yahoo! Inc.
aims to stave off competition from Facebook Inc. and Twitter
Inc. as the place on the Web where professionals communicate
with one another -- and where advertisers reach them.  
 LinkedIn is fielding inquiries from bankers interested in
the company, Weiner said, without identifying any of the
securities firms or saying if an initial public offering may be
coming.  
 “Many people are interested in what we will be doing,” he
said. “The better we execute, the more options we have.”  
 For the past two years, Weiner said, LinkedIn has generated
positive operating cash flow, which typically means a company
has high enough sales to cover operating expenses and capital
spending needs. This year will be its most successful year since
the company’s  founding  in 2003, he said.  
 Money in Bank  
 In 2008, Mountain View, California-based LinkedIn raised
$76 million in funding from investors, including Bain Capital
Ventures. The sum remains in the bank, Weiner said. “We haven’t
touched it,” he said. “We don’t need the capital.”  
 LinkedIn will use deals to help it make information about
members’ work histories and skills more accessible on mobile
devices, and to let other companies more readily add their own
tools to make LinkedIn more useful, Weiner said.  
 He plans to start with smaller acquisitions. That way the
company can ensure it’s able to blend the talent and technology
of potential targets with LinkedIn’s, Weiner said.  
 Twitter Connection  
 He’s also pushing the company to be more relevant. A
November 2009 deal lets Twitter users broadcast their short blog
posts to LinkedIn and send LinkedIn status updates to Twitter
followers, giving the messages more context, Weiner said. “When
you tweet on Twitter, it’s up in the ether and then it’s gone,”
he said.  
 LinkedIn is improving the website’s ability to recommend
other professionals users may know, and to let people search for
others who meet specific criteria, he said.  
 LinkedIn’s audience makes the site attractive to
advertisers, yet it’s not as popular as Twitter and Facebook.  
 The average LinkedIn user has a yearly household income of
more than $107,000, according to the company, citing Nielsen Co.
data. Still, LinkedIn had 45.1 million unique visitors in May,
compared with 548.1 million for Facebook and 90.2 million for
Twitter, according to market researcher  ComScore Inc.   
 “There’s going to be overlap,” Weiner said. “We’re going
to continue to focus on professionals exclusively.”  
 LinkedIn is hiring to bolster sales, product development
and overseas operations, Weiner said. The company is growing
quickly in Brazil, India, China, Italy and Spain, and it’s
opened offices in cities such as Mumbai and Sydney. LinkedIn is
planning to put an office in Toronto as well.  
 “We are going to see significant growth overseas,” Weiner
said. “We hope to see more revenue and profit coming from those
markets.”
