             Customers of  Dish Network Corp. ’s
satellite-TV service lost access to four high-definition
channels owned by  Walt Disney Co.  in a fee dispute between the
companies.  
 HD programming from ESPNews, ABC Family, Disney Channel and
Disney XD was taken down today, the companies said in separate
e-mailed statements. The standard-definition versions of the
channels are still available.  
 Dish says it wants to negotiate a contract with Disney that
allows the pay-TV operator to continue offering low-priced HD
programming. Disney says a New York state court ruled in March
that Dish didn’t have the right to air its HD channels for free.
Dish, which is appealing the decision, paid Disney $65 million
in overdue fees, Multichannel News  reported  earlier today.  
 “We could not agree to the significant fees requested by
Disney,” Dish said. Both companies said in their statements
they hope to reach an agreement.  
 Disney, the world’s biggest media company, declined 71
cents to $34.35 today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The Burbank, California-based company’s  shares  have
climbed 6.5 percent this year.  
 Dish, owner of the second biggest U.S. satellite-TV
service, fell 79 cents to $20.25 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The Englewood, Colorado-based company’s  stock  has
slipped 2.5 percent this year.
