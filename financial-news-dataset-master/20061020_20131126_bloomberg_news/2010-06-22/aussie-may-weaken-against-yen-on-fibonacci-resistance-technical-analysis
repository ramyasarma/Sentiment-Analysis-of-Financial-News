             The Australian dollar may fall to a
two-week low against the yen after struggling to break through a
key level of so-called resistance, Gaitame.Com Research
Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The currency yesterday closed below 79.98 yen after briefly
rising above that level, suggesting its upward momentum may
stall, said  Takuya Kawabata , a researcher at the unit of Japan’s
largest foreign-exchange margin company in Tokyo. That level
represents a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency’s
decline from 88.06 yen on April 30 to 71.90 yen on May 21.  
 “The currency may test lower prices again if that level
weighs on it,” Kawabata said in an interview.  
 Australia’s dollar traded at 79.86 yen as of 10:02 a.m. in
Sydney from 79.85 yen in New York yesterday. The currency has
declined 4.4 percent this year against Japan’s.  
 The so-called Aussie may drop to its 20-day moving average,
Kawabata said. The average was at 77.43 yen today.  
 Should it fall below that level, the Australian dollar may
extend losses to around 75.70 yen at a support line connecting
the lows reached on May 25 and June 7, Kawabata said. It was
last below that level on June 10.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates a currency
may move to the next level. Resistance refers to an area where
sell orders may be clustered. Support is an area where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a currency.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
