             Russian Industry and Trade Minister
Viktor Khristenko said he is unaware of “millions of tons” of

testimony delivered in a Moscow court in response to questions
by the company’s former Chief Executive Officer Mikhail
Khodorkovsky. Khodorkovsky faces 22 1/2 years in prison, in
addition to an eight-year sentence for fraud, if found guilty of
stealing 350 million tons of oil from the company.
