             U.K.  homebuilders  rallied in London
trading after the government announced an increase in capital
gains tax that was smaller than most analysts and investors
anticipated.  
 The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index gained 2.7 percent,
led by Barratt Developments Plc, the biggest company in the
industry by volume.  
 From tomorrow, people with total annual income of more than
37,400 pounds ($55,500) will have to pay capital gains tax of 28
percent, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said today
in a budget speech to lawmakers. The current rate is 18 percent.  
 “There were lots of scare stories about negative measures,
and these are not as bad as the fears over the last month,”
said  Mark Hughes , an analyst at Panmure Gordon based in the
English city of Liverpool.  
 Before the budget, Osborne said he would press ahead with
plans to increase the rate to prevent the wealthy from
sheltering their money from income tax rates of as much as 50
percent by declaring it as investment gains.  
 “Bearing in mind the budget it could have been, we’re
reasonably pleased,” said  Steve Turner , a spokesman for the
 Home Builders Federation , the industry’s main lobby group. “It
seems sensible and as good as could have been expected.”  
 Barratt, based in London, climbed 4.4 percent to 108.4
pence. Redrow Plc, another U.K. homebuilder, rose 3.2 percent to
127 pence.
