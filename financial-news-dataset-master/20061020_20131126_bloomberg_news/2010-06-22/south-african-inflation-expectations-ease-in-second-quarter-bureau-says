             South African inflation expectations
eased in the second quarter from the previous three months, the
Bureau for Economic Research said.  
 Analysts, business executives and labor union officials
expect the inflation rate to drop to an average of 6.3 percent
this year, compared with 6.5 percent forecast in the first
quarter, the bureau said in an e-mailed statement today.
Inflation is forecast to accelerate to an average of 6.5 percent
in 2011 and 6.8 percent in 2012, staying outside the central
bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range, it said.  
 The bureau is based at the University of Stellenbosch, near
Cape Town.
