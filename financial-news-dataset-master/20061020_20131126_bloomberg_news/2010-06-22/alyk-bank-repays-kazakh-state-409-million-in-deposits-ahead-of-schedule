             Halyk Savings Bank  said it returned
60 billion tenge ($409 million) deposited by Kazakhstan’s state-
owned Samruk-Kazyna fund 1 1/2 years before the loan was due to
be repaid after the bank accumulated extra liquidity.  
 The lender, controlled by Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ’s daughter and son-in-law, held the deposits for half
their three-year term, the Almaty-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The lender utilized 154 billion tenge provided
through government programs in 2009, it said.  
 Halyk Bank’s corporate customers raised deposits 11.6
percent during the first quarter to 975 billion tenge, while
household deposits rose 2.8 percent to 411 billion tenge in the
period, the bank said.
