             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, reduced its price
forecasts for crude oil because commodity markets are
“fragile” on concern growth in Europe and China will slow.  
 West Texas Intermediate oil, traded in New York, was
forecast at $100 a barrel in 2011, down 9.1 percent from its
previous prediction of $110, Goldman said in a report today. The
bank also downgraded prices for three-month, six-month and 12-
month crude and for Brent oil, traded in London.  
 “Commodity markets are generally rebounding strongly off
their lows but sentiment remains fragile on European and Chinese
concerns,” said analysts led by New York-based  Allison Nathan .
“Markets will remain fragile until there is further evidence
that sovereign pressures are stabilizing and global trend
economic growth remains intact.”  
 Oil in New York has gained more than 10 percent so far in
June, set for the biggest monthly increase since October, amid
speculation global demand for fuels will recover as Europe
overcomes its debt crisis. Futures yesterday reached a six-week
high of $78.92 a barrel after China, the world’s second-largest
energy consumer, signaled an end to the yuan’s fixed rate to the
dollar, a move that may boost the country’s purchasing power.  
 “We have lowered our three-month oil and base metals price
forecasts but to levels still above current prices, and maintain
a positive medium-term view of key commodities,” the analysts
said.  
 Goldman said the market is “overestimating” any negative
impact of government policies on growth and has discounted
possible constraints on oil supply in the future.  
 ‘Too Bearish’  
 “Sentiment is too bearish on both the sovereign-debt risks
as well as the effects of macroeconomic momentum slowing,” the
analysts wrote. “Despite some macro slowing, absolute growth
indicators are still firmly positive.”  
 WTI, a low-sulfur crude, is the reference grade for futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent is quoted
in oil contracts at the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 “Implied demand for key commodities has remained at
exceptionally high levels in the emerging markets,” the Goldman
analysts said. “Developed market demand has generally surprised
to the upside.”  
 WTI contracts for December delivery have gained $3.40 a
barrel since a May 10 buy recommendation, according to the
report.  
 Global fuel consumption will increase 2 percent this year
to a record 86.4 million barrels a day, the International Energy
Agency predicted June 10.
