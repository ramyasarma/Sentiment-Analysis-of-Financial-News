             Sales of U.S. previously owned homes
rose in May to the highest level in six months as buyers rushed
to beat a June tax-credit deadline, economists said before a
report today.  
 Purchases  of existing houses, which are tabulated when a
contract closes, increased 6 percent to a 6.12 million annual
rate, according to the  median  of 73 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. To receive a government incentive worth as much as
$8,000, buyers must have signed contracts by the end of April
and need to complete deals by the end of this month.  
 Credit-induced gyrations will make the underlying health of
the market difficult to determine over the next couple of months.
A slump in builder shares since early May signals investors are
concerned the damage caused by the end of government stimulus,
mounting foreclosures and  unemployment  will exceed the benefits
of lower mortgage rates.  
 “There are still a lot of headwinds as we’re making this
important transition,”  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond
James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. “The real
key in all this will be the labor market. You’re not going to
see a sustainable housing recovery without job growth.”  
 The report from the National Association of Realtors is due
at 10 a.m. in Washington. Economists’ estimates ranged from 5.2
million to 6.5 million after a 5.77 million rate in April.  
 Demand last exceeded May’s projected level in November, the
month the tax break was first due to expire, when sales reached
an almost three-year high 6.49 million pace. The smaller jump
last month shows the incentive lost power after being extended.  
 Fed Outlook  
 Federal Reserve policy makers, who begin a two-day meeting
today, are forecast to commit to keeping interest rates near
zero to help wean the world’s largest economy off government
stimulus. The hazard posed by the European debt crisis,
joblessness and a lack of inflation add to the reasons why
central bankers will focus on sustaining the U.S. rebound.  
 Industry reports signal residential real estate is slowing.
Housing  starts  last month dropped by the most since March 2009,
and building permits, a sign of future construction, fell to a
one-year low, data from the Commerce Department showed. The
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo  confidence
index  for June fell by the most since November 2008.  
 The number of  mortgage applications  filed to purchase
houses dropped this month to the lowest level since 1997,
according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.  
 Builder Shares  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilder  Index ,
which includes Toll Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., has dropped
27 percent since reaching a 19-month high on May 3. The broader
 S&P 500  Index is down 8.6 percent from April 23’s 19-month peak.  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. , the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, said orders fell 17 percent in the quarter ended April
30 from a year earlier, and contract signings slowed in May,
indicating the tax credit helped pull some sales forward.  
 “The expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit, the
lack of job growth and a potential increase in foreclosures all
pose risks to a housing-industry recovery,”  Ara K. Hovnanian ,
chief executive officer, said in a June 2 statement.  
 Senator  Harry Reid , a Democrat from Nevada, this month
proposed extending the tax credit’s closing deadline from June
30 to Sept. 30 amid concern that a rush of buyers created too
big a backlog for builders to complete projects in time. Senate
Democrats on June 17 failed to get the 60 votes needed to move
forward with the legislation that includes the proposal.  
 Slump Looms  
 The window of opportunity for the tax credit has already
passed for purchases of new houses, which are tabulated at
contract signings and are considered a timelier barometer of the
market. A Commerce Department report tomorrow will show  new home
sales  plunged 21 percent to a 400,000 annual pace last month,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed.  
 Existing homes account for about 90 percent of the market.  
 Builders are being hurt by competition from foreclosed
properties that are depressing property values.  Foreclosures 
jumped to a record for the second consecutive month in May as
lenders stepped up property seizures, according to RealtyTrac
Inc., an Irvine, California-based data seller.  
 Cheaper borrowing costs are helping mitigate the damage.
The  average rate  on a fixed 30-year mortgage was 4.75 percent
last week, just shy of the record-low 4.71 percent reached in
early December, according to data from Freddie Mac, the
mortgage-finance company being supported by the U.S. government.
