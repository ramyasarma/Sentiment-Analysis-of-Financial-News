             Brazil’s central bank cut its
estimate for  foreign direct investment  this year by 16 percent
as the European debt crisis reduces global capital flows.  
 Foreign direct investment will reach $38 billion in 2010,
down from an earlier forecast of $45 billion, the central bank
said today in a  report  distributed in Brasilia.  
 Brazil’s  economy expanded  at the fastest pace in 15 years
in the first quarter from a year earlier, and the central bank’s
survey of economists estimate that Latin America’s biggest
economy will expand 7.06 percent in 2010.  
 Slowing economic growth in some to the world’s major
economies will limit investments,  Zeina Latif , chief economist
at ING Bank NV, said.  
 “It is obvious Brazil will feel the impact from Europe,
which accounts for about half of the FDI entering the country,”
Latif said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. “That said,
Brazil’s share of world FDI is likely to increase this year.”  
 Latif expects Brazil’s share of global FDI to exceed 3
percent this year, up from 2.5 percent in 2009.  
 Brazil posted a $2 billion  current account  deficit in May,
the smallest gap in nine months, the central bank said. FDI was
$3.5 billion, the central bank said.  
 The bank maintained its estimate for the current account
gap this year at $49 billion.  
 The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.7640 per dollar at 11:02
a.m. New York time, from 1.7712 yesterday. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January was unchanged at 11.29 percent.
