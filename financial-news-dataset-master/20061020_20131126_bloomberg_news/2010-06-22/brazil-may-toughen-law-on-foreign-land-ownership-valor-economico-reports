             Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  requested a group of ministers and aides prepare a 
bill to toughen laws on foreign ownership of land, Valor 
Economico reported, citing Agrarian Development Minister 
 Guilherme Cassel .  
 The government may also revoke land licenses already held 
by foreigners, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.   
 “We don’t want them to buy land here,” the newspaper 
cited Cassel as saying. “We don’t need foreigners to produce 
here. That’s the policy announced by President Lula. Brazilian 
land has to remain in the hands of Brazilians, because that has
to do with food security.”
