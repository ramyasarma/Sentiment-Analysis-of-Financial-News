             China’s decision to ease the yuan’s
peg against the dollar may bolster the global economic recovery
and help Mexico’s export-driven manufacturing industry, said
 Miguel Messmacher , chief economist at Mexico’s Finance Ministry.  
 China’s June 19 pledge to make the currency more flexible
will help close “global imbalances” between countries with
large current account surpluses and countries with large current
account deficits, Messmacher said in a telephone interview.  
 “The announcement is very important from the point of view
of these global imbalances,” Messmacher said today. “It could
have an effect on our exports.”  
 The yuan rose the most in five years yesterday after the
central bank said it would increase the currency’s
“flexibility,” scrapping a two-year peg against the dollar
aimed at shielding exporters from the global financial crisis.  
 Mexico’s economy stands to benefit from China’s decision as
it may increase manufacturing costs in the Asian country, Morgan
Stanley analyst  Gray Newman  said in a report today. A stronger
yuan makes China less attractive as a low-cost manufacturer,
which may help Mexico compete as a destination for U.S.
manufacturers seeking to reduce expenses, the report said.
