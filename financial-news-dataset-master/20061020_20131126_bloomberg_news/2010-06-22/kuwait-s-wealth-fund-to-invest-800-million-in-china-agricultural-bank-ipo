             Kuwait Investment Authority, the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, will invest $800 million in the
initial public offering of the Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.,
Kuwaiti Finance Minister  Mustafa al-Shimali  said.  
 “It’s a long-term investment,” al-Shimali told reporters
today in parliament when asked about Agricultural Bank’s IPO.  
 Kuwait Investment Authority offered as much as $1 billion,
a figure that was reduced to $800 million, a person familiar
with the transaction said yesterday, declining to be identified
because the talks are private.  
 Qatar Investment Authority also agreed to invest $2.8
billion in Agricultural Bank, China’s largest lender by number
of customers, two people with knowledge of the matter said on
June 20. The Chinese lender has allocated more than $5 billion
for corporate investors such as QIA in the Hong Kong part of its
IPO, the people said.  
 Agricultural Bank  is seeking to raise as much as $15
billion in Hong Kong as part of what may be the world’s largest
IPO, according to an e-mail sent to investors last week. The
Beijing-based lender may sell as much as $28 billion of stock in
Hong Kong and Shanghai combined, exceeding the $22 billion sale
by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in 2006.
