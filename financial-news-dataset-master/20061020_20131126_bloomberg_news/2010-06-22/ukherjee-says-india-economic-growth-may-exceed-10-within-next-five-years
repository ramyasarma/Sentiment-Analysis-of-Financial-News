             Indian Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said annual growth in Asia’s third-largest economy may
exceed 10 percent in the next five years.  
 “I’m optimistic about India’s growth,” Mukherjee said in
a speech today at the U.S. State Department in Washington.
“India will break into double-digit growth within the next five
years.”  
 India’s $1.2 trillion economy expanded 8.6 percent in the
three months through March from a year earlier, the fastest pace
after China and Brazil among major economies. Prices are also
rising as consumer demand strengthens, and India’s benchmark
wholesale-price  inflation  unexpectedly accelerated 10.16 percent
in May from a year earlier.  
 Mukherjee’s remarks follow a speech yesterday, when he said
growth may be about 8.5 percent in the fiscal year ending March
31, 2011, and that his goal is to accelerate it to a more than
10 percent annual pace.  
 India’s inflation rate may halve to about 5 percent by
March, the finance minister said yesterday in the speech at the
Institute of International Finance in Washington. The Reserve
Bank of India has increased interest rates twice since mid-March
to control prices.
