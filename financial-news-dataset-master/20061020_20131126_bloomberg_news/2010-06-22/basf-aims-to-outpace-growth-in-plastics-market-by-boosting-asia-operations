             BASF SE , the world’s biggest chemical
company, said it plans to outpace the expected 5 percent annual
growth in the global plastics market by boosting operations in
Asia.  
 BASF’s plastics division will report higher sales and a
“significant” improvement in earnings in 2010, board member
 Martin Brudermueller  reiterated at a press conference in
Frankenthal, Germany, today. Demand in Asia will grow at
6 percent a year through 2015, he said.  
 Brudermueller said BASF will continue to reduce
overcapacity in standard plastics by shedding sites and
activities. The German chemical maker, which is in the throes of
divesting a styrene operation, is moving toward more specialty
plastics that now account for one-half of plastic deliveries.  
 Sales at BASF’s plastics segment fell 22 percent last year,
the second consecutive decline, weighed down by both lower
volumes and a 15 percent slide in prices. Operating profit rose
2.7 percent to 554 million euros ($682 million), after
collapsing by 54 percent the prior year.  
 Investment will be focused on the Asian region,
Brudermueller said.  
 BASF supplies polyurethanes, soft and solid foams used as
insulation material and for packaging, as well as polyamides,
widely used for synthetic fibers such as nylon in the textiles
industry.
