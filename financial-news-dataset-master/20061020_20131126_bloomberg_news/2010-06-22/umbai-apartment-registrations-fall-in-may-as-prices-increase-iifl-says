             Mumbai home registrations fell below
6,000 for the first time in 11 months in May as property prices
in the country’s financial capital climbed, lowering
affordability, brokerage IIFL said.  
 Apartment registrations in Mumbai fell to 5,337 units last
month, a 25 percent decline from April, Mumbai-based IIFL said
in a note to clients today.  
 “We believe this fall is largely attributable to the high
property prices,”  Bhaskar Chakraborty  and  Avi Mehta , analysts
at IIFL, said in the note. “Given the strong pipeline across
Mumbai, the rate of increase in property prices would abate.”  
 Mumbai home prices jumped about 30 percent in the six
months to April,  Pranay Vakil , chairman of real-estate brokerage
Knight Frank (India) Pvt. said at the time.  
 Registration data is a lagging indicator of demand as
properties are registered two to three months after the actual
purchase, according to IIFL. The brokerage expects registrations
to remain subdued over the next few months, it added.
