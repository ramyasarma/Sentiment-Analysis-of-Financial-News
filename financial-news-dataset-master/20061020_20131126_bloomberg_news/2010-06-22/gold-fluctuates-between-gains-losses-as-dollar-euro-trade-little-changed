             Gold rose on speculation that the
dollar will ease, boosting demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment. Platinum rose, capping the longest rally
in two months.  
 The dollar fluctuated against a basket of six major
currencies. The euro has climbed 3.3 percent from a four-year
low on June 7 as European-debt concerns abated. Yesterday, gold
futures reached a record $1,266.50 an ounce. The metal has
gained 13 percent this year.  
 “You’re seeing the flight-to-quality fears out of Europe
subsiding and gold returning to its classic relationship to the
dollar,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  
 Gold futures for delivery in August rose 10 cents to
$1,240.80 on the Comex in New York. Gold for immediate delivery
gained $3.15, or 0.3 percent, to $1,236.85 at 2:51 p.m. New York
time.  
 Gold historically has moved inversely to the dollar. The
metal climbed to records in euros, sterling and Swiss francs
this month on the heels of Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “Gold’s inverse relationship to the dollar is returning,”
said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset
Management. “It was an abnormality that gold was moving with
the dollar. Eventually, these market relationships revert to the
norm.”  
 Yesterday, spot gold dropped 1.8 percent, the most in a
month. The decline may attract new buyers, analysts said.  
 “In the past, price-sensitive buyers have rushed into the
market to stock up on bullion based on the expectation that
prices would be even higher,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at
MF Global Holdings Ltd., a broker in Chicago.  
 Platinum Rises  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $2.80, or 0.2
percent, to $1,602.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal was up for the fourth straight session, the
longest rally since April.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $5.50, or
1.1 percent, to $489.95 an ounce.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 9.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $18.947 an ounce on the Comex.
