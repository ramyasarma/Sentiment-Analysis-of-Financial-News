             Abacus Mining & Exploration Corp. 
shareholders approved a plan to jointly develop a mine in
British Columbia and other projects with  KGHM Polska Miedz SA ,
Poland’s only copper producer.  
 Abacus shareholders voted 90 percent in favor of the deal,
the Vancouver-based metals explorer said today after a special
meeting of investors.  
 KGHM agreed last month to pay $37 million for a 51 percent
stake in a venture to develop the Afton-Ajax copper deposit near
Kamloops, British Columbia. Lubin, Poland-based KGHM also has
the right to buy another 29 percent of the venture with Abacus
for $35 million.  
 KGHM is seeking to expand its copper reserves and reduce
its average production costs by tapping Abacus’s exploration
expertise. The two companies said last month they will cooperate
in a global search for copper deposits.  
 The Polish company, the world’s ninth-largest copper
producer and third-larger silver miner, last month acquired 8.75
percent of Abacus’s outstanding shares for C$4.5 million ($4.4
million) in a private placement.  
 Abacus was unchanged at 17 cents as of 12:38 p.m. in TSX
Venture Exchange trading in Toronto.  The shares  declined 11
percent this year through yesterday.  
 KGHM  fell  2.5 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 92.5 zloty in
Warsaw Stock Exchange trading.
