             The  SkyTeam  airline alliance, whose
members include  Delta Air Lines Inc.  and  Air France-KLM , said
it’s talking with about a dozen other carriers to join the group
and may add two of them by year-end.  
 SkyTeam needs new members to expand in Asia, India and
Latin America, alliance Chairman  Leo van Wijk  said today in a
telephone interview from New York. He declined to name the
carriers that SkyTeam is pursuing, saying most are regional
carriers serving a single country or a few countries.  
 “Latin America is still a relatively wide spot for us,”
said van Wijk, who is also vice chairman of Air France-KLM.
“It’s not easy to find a partner who covers all of it, so you
have to go with multiple partners who cover pieces.”  
 SkyTeam was formed 10 years ago and will have 13 members
when Romania’s Tarom Romanian Air Transport formally joins later
this week. China Eastern plans to join in the coming months.  
 SkyTeam is the second-largest global airline alliance based
on miles flown by paying passengers, according to the
International Air Transport Association. It ranks behind the
 Star Alliance  anchored by  UAL Corp. ’s United Airlines and
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG . The smallest is  Oneworld , whose members
including  AMR Corp. ’s American Airlines and  British Airways Plc .
