             The yen rose the most in more than
two weeks against the euro on speculation European banks will
struggle to raise money, damping global growth and supporting
demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 The yen climbed versus 12 of its 16 most-traded peers after
European Central Bank governing council member  Christian Noyer 
said some banks in the euro region face funding problems. The
shared currency fell, after reaching the highest level in almost
a month yesterday, on speculation China’s central bank will move
to limit gains in the yuan after loosening a two-year peg to the
greenback.  
 “We’re seeing a bit more caution in the market,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in Washington at Travelex Global
Business Payments, a currency-exchange network. “Markets have
really reassessed the impact of China’s shift in currency policy
on markets; any move in the yuan is expected to be only a
gradual one.”  
 Japan’s currency advanced 0.6 percent to 111.54 per euro at
9:50 a.m. in New York. It gained as much as 1 percent, the most
on an intraday basis since June 7. The yen rose 0.4 percent to
90.76 per dollar, from 91.11 yesterday.  
 The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1.2252 before
trading at $1.2293. It rose to $1.2487 yesterday, the strongest
since May 24, as China’s decision sparked optimism about the
prospects for global growth.  
 The shared currency pared losses as traders reduced bets
against it before the U.S. reports existing-home sales data at
10 a.m. in Washington.  
 ‘Short Covering’  
 “We saw some short covering earlier in the New York
morning, they were just buying back euros before the housing
numbers,” said  Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a senior currency trader
at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. Short covering is when
traders buy back an asset to cancel out a previous trade that
anticipated a decline.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent.  
 “Some banks have started facing increasing funding
problems,” Noyer said at a conference in Paris. “The situation
reflects a general state of uncertainty which, left unchecked,
could have significant consequences on financial stability.”  
 The pound rose after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the government will impose a levy on banks and
raise the sales tax in the biggest budget cuts in a generation.
The move is aimed at guarding the nation’s top credit rating
without strangling recovery. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to
$1.4821.  
 Yuan Declines  
 The yuan declined the most since December 2008, falling 0.2
percent to 6.8130 per dollar. China’s reference rate for the
yuan surged by 0.43 percent, the most since 2005. The People’s
Bank of China set the daily rate at 6.7980 per dollar, compared
with 6.8275 yesterday, and the yuan’s close of 6.7976. It said
on June 19 it would abandon the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar.  
 “The enthusiasm fades rapidly,”  Derek Halpenny , European
head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
wrote in a note to clients today. “There was certainly an over-
reaction to China’s announcement and this event, like in 2005,
will probably change little in terms of the global capital flow
structure or the outlook for the global economy.”  
 Won Drops  
 South Korea’s won led the Asian currencies lower as the
MSCI World Index fell 0.2 percent, snapping a 10-day run of
advances. The won fell 0.9 percent to 1,182 per dollar. It
reached 1,169.25 yesterday, the strongest since May 20.  
 Spanish savings banks may borrow around 10 billion euros
($12.3 billion) from the country’s bank-rescue fund, known as
the FROB, Bank of Spain Governor  Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez 
said today in Madrid.  
 “Concerns about Spanish banks needing more money and a
growing uneasiness about what will happen once the ECB reduces
its 12-month credits has made it a risk-off day,” said  John Hydeskov , a Copenhagen-based analyst at Danske Bank A/S.
“That’s good for the yen.”  
 European leaders including German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
have called for aggressive deficit cutting from the Group of 20
nations, in contrast to President  Barack Obama ’s emphasis on
growth ahead of the G-20 summit meeting in Toronto June 26-27.  
 Forecasting U.K. growth of 1.2 percent this year and 2.3
percent in 2011, Osborne said he will tax bank balance sheets
starting next year to generate 2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion)
of annual revenue. The value-added tax rate will rise to 20
percent in January, from 17.5 percent.  
 ‘Will Find Relief’  
 “From a sterling perspective, rising risk of double-dip
recession as the fiscal stance is tightened cannot be too
welcome,” analysts led by  Marc Chandler , New York-based global
head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.,
wrote in a research note today before Osborne’s announcement.
“But those in the market fearing rating downgrades will find
relief from an adjustment in the fiscal outlook.”  
 The Swiss franc appreciated against the euro after Swiss
National Bank Vice Chairman  Thomas Jordan  said there is
currently no need to intervene and stem the rise of the currency
as the threat of deflation has largely disappeared. The comments
came on Swiss TV’s Eco program last night.  
 The franc strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.3611 per euro,
after trading earlier at a record 1.3592.
