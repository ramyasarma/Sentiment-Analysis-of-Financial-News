             Agreement on a global bank levy and
a financial transaction tax are a test of Group of 20 unity with
the debate among G-20 leaders meeting in Canada sure not to be
easy, a German government official said.  
 The G-20 is split on the twin issues of a bank levy and a
financial transaction tax, the official said in Berlin today on
condition of anonymity. Germany, France and other European Union
state will push the levies, and Germany will seek an EU-wide
solution if the G-20 fails to agree, the official said.
