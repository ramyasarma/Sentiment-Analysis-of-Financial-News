             U.S. frozen-pork stockpiles were 23
percent smaller at the end of May than a year earlier, as cuts
to the domestic hog herd spurred declines in meat production.  
 Warehouses held 448.3 million pounds of pork on May 31,
down from 584.5 million a year earlier, when supplies were the
highest on record for the month, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Inventories fell 7.3 percent
from the end of April.  
 Hog farmers have slashed herds after losing money because
of high feed costs in 2008 and declining pork demand because of
recession and swine flu in 2009. U.S. commercial pork  production 
may have shrunk by 5.7 percent in May from a year earlier, said
 Bob Brown , an independent market analyst in Edmond, Oklahoma.  
 “Production has been down quite a bit and that’s making
people draw stocks out” of the freezers, Brown said. “We’re
coming off of a couple years of the most horrific profitability
issues in pork production in a long time.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement climbed 0.15 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 84.5 cents a pound today on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The most-active contract is up 39 percent in the past
year as supplies shrank and pork demand rebounded. As of March
1, the U.S. sow herd totaled 5.76 million, the fewest on record.  
 U.S. warehouse supplies of ham fell 3.4 percent from a year
earlier to 92 million pounds, according to today’s report.
Inventories of pork bellies, which are cured and sliced to make
bacon, plunged 44 percent to 43.7 million pounds.  
 Chicken-meat stockpiles at the end of May were 9 percent
larger than a year earlier at 699.5 million pounds, the USDA
said. Beef inventories shrank 13 percent to 363.8 million
pounds.
