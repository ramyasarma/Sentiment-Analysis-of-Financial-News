             Silver may surge to as much as $23
an ounce next year, the highest price since 1980, as investors
seek a cheap alternative to gold and a global economic recovery
boosts industrial demand, according to Commerzbank AG.  
 The metal may advance to as much as $21 an ounce by the end
of this year, about 12 percent higher than yesterday’s close,
 Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research, wrote in a report,
dubbing the metal “gold’s little brother.” Compared with gold,
silver may be considered low priced, Weinberg wrote.  
 Gold surged to a record $1,265.30 an ounce yesterday as
investors sought to preserve their wealth against declining
currencies, and China’s decision to drop the yuan’s dollar peg
boosted commodity prices. There’s rising demand for silver, or
“poor man’s gold,” the Perth Mint said earlier this month.  
 “Gold is still a priority for investors” who are looking
for shelter from growing economic uncertainty,  Ng Cheng Thye , a
Singapore-based director at Standard Merchant Bank Ltd., said by
phone today. There’s also “a good chance for silver to rally
higher,” possibly to $20 an ounce, Ng said.  
 Silver for immediate delivery traded at $18.8213 an ounce
at 4:43 p.m. in Singapore, 11 percent higher since the start of
the year. Gold, which has risen 13 percent in 2010, was at
$1,239.75 an ounce.  
 Weinberg’s targets add to signs of increased investor
interest in precious metals. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, have risen 15
percent in 2010 to a record 1,307.96 tons. The Perth Mint said
Europe’s debt crisis was spurring demand.  
 ‘Low-Cost Alternative’  
 “As with gold, silver is also considered to exhibit
stabilizing characteristics when it comes to value,” Weinberg
wrote in yesterday’s report. “Silver is reasonably priced
compared to gold and constitutes a low-cost alternative.”  
 The ratio between gold and silver had risen to about 65
compared with an average of 59 over the past “several years,”
the report said. “We expect this ratio to swing back, leading
to potential for silver,” Weinberg said.  
 An ounce of gold for immediate delivery  bought  about 65.81
ounces of silver today, compared with the 2008 low of 47.55
ounces and the decade average of 61.99 ounces, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  
 Silver sales would be boosted by an expected recovery of
industrial demand, with the metal used in solar cells, mobile-
phone covers and photography, the report said. Global demand may
increase by as much as 50 million ounces by 2011, it said.  
 Economic growth in China, already a net importer of silver,
would also boost sales, Weinberg wrote. China’s import demands
are likely to increase, “having a positive impact on the
price,” the report said.
