             Mauritius’s central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged for a fifth consecutive
meeting as inflation climbs and the economy recovers.  
 The repo rate was left at 5.75 percent, the Port Louis-
based  Bank of Mauritius  said on its website today. The bank last
cut the rate by 1 percentage point on March 2009.  
 Inflation accelerated to an annual 2.7 percent in April
from 2.3 percent in the previous month, the statistics office
said on May 7. The central bank cut its key rate three times
between October 2008 and March 2009 to spur the Indian Ocean
island’s economy, which will probably expand 4.2 percent this
year, up from 2.8 percent in 2009, according to the African
Development Bank.  
 The central bank raised the cash reserve ratio for
commercial banks to 5 percent from 4.5 percent to curb “excess
liquidity” and ease inflation pressure, it said on June 16.  
 Mauritius, located about 500 miles (805 kilometers) off the
east coast of Madagascar, earns most of its foreign currency
from tourism and exports of sugar, clothing and textiles.
