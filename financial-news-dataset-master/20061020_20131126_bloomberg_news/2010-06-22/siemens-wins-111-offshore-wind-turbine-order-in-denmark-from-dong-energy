             Siemens AG , the biggest supplier of
turbines to generate power from offshore wind, won an order for
111 sea-based machines from Denmark’s Dong Energy A/S.  
 Terms for the order, part of a 400-megawatt wind farm off
the Danish island of Anholt, weren’t disclosed. The wind park
will generate the equivalent of 4 percent of Denmark’s power,
Munich-based Siemens said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Investments in ocean-based windmills will rise about 30
percent this year to $3.9 billion, outpacing growth of less than
10 percent onshore, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.
According to the European Wind Energy Association, Siemens last
year sold about 70 percent of the turbines installed offshore.  
 Each Siemens turbine to be installed has a capacity of 3.6
megawatts and has a diameter of 120 meters (394 feet). The
Anholt Offshore Wind Farm project will be completed by 2013, the
company said. Dong Energy estimated the total project costs at
10 billion Danish kroner ($1.65 billion).
