             ThyssenKrupp AG ’s workers council
may block the company’s plan to sell metalworking operations,
 Rheinische Post  reported, citing group works council chairman
 Thomas Schlenz .  
 The sale isn’t certain as the company’s supervisory board
hasn’t approved it yet and the unit has been a large consumer of
flat steel made by ThyssenKrupp, the German newspaper cited
Schlenz as saying in an interview.
