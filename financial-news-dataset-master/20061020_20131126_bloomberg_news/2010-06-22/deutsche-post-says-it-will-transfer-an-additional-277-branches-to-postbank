             Deutsche Post AG  said it’s
transferring 277 branches on July 1 to Deutsche Postbank AG,
which will offer postal services on behalf of Europe’s largest
mail carrier.  
  Postbank  will assume the rental contracts for the outlets
and buy their inventory, Stefan Hess, a spokesman for Bonn-based
Deutsche Post, said by phone. He declined to specify the
purchase price.  
 Deutsche Post is trying to slash costs at its  mail division 
as revenue from traditional postal operations declines with
increasing use of e-mail and growing competition within Germany.
Postbank took over about 850 branches under the same model in
2006 and will now operate more than 1,100 offices in Germany.  
 Deutsche Post, operator of the DHL express-mail and freight
business, aims to sell its remaining 80 traditional post offices
by the end of 2011, Hess said.  
 “This arrangement allows us to work with better cost
efficiency, and Postbank increases its network,” Hess said.
“Postbank is a partner we know very well. Staff and procedures
remain the same, so nothing changes for our customers.”  
 Deutsche Post  owns  39.5 of the lender. Postbank was the
fully owned banking unit of Deutsche Post before a 2004  initial
public offering .
