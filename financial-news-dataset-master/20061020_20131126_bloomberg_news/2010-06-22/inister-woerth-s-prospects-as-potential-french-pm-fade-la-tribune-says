             French Labor Minister Eric Woerth’s
prospects as a potential candidate to become prime minister
faded after his alleged entanglement in a conflict of interest
case involving L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, La Tribune
said, without citing anyone.  
 Transcripts of an alleged conversation by Bettencourt,
taped secretly by her butler and published on the website of
news service Mediapart, suggested that the heiress was planning
on evading taxes, the newspaper said.  
 Woerth’s announcement yesterday that his wife, Florence,
was resigning from her role as the manager of Bettencourt’s
finances may have come too late, the financial daily said. The
opposition Socialist Party has asked for Woerth’s resignation,
Tribune said. Woerth has denied any wrongdoing.  
 Separately, the newspaper said Bettencourt has pledged to
declare all of her foreign assets to comply with French laws. In
the transcript, Bettencourt is alleged to have funnelled 80
million euros in undeclared funds to Swiss accounts, it said.
