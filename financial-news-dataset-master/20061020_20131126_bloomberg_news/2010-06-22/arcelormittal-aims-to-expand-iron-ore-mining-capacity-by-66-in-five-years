             ArcelorMittal , the world’s biggest
steelmaker, plans to expand iron-ore capacity by two-thirds
within five years to protect against price volatility, Chief
Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal  said.  
 It aims to raise capacity to 100 million metric tons from
60 million tons, he said today in an interview in New York.  
 “Vertical integration has always been our strategy and now
it gets even more reinforced,” he said.  
 Steelmakers paid higher prices for iron ore and other raw
materials such as coking coal this year on rising demand in
China, the world’s largest producer of the metal. They also face
having to buy iron ore from  BHP Billiton Ltd. ,  Vale SA  and  Rio
Tinto Group , the three biggest exporters, based on quarterly
contracts instead of fixed-price, annual accords.  
 Mittal said earlier in a speech at the Steel Success
Strategies conference that he doesn’t favor quarterly pricing,
which could be “dangerous.”  
 “The reality of quarterly pricing means raw material costs
will increase over the remainder of this year,” he said in the
speech.  
 Australia’s BHP and London-based Rio are likely to increase
quarterly iron-ore prices by about 23 percent in the three
months starting July 1, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. The
spot price for 63 percent iron ore has advanced 90 percent in
the past 12 months, according to  data  from The Steel Index.  
 ArcelorMittal’s mines supply about half its iron ore needs,
and the Luxembourg-based company is seeking to bolster self-
sufficiency in coking coal to as much as 25 percent from 15
percent, Head of Strategy  Bill Scotting  said in December.  
 The company has  added  mining assets in Brazil and Russia
since Mittal Steel Co. bought Arcelor SA in 2006 in the steel
industry’s biggest takeover.  
 Chinese steel demand, which rose 25 percent last year,
created an imbalance in the iron-ore market, Mittal said in his
speech. China’s demand may rise 10 percent this year, higher
than his earlier forecast of 5 percent, he said.
