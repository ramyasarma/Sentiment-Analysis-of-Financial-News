             United Arab Emirates and Qatar
shares were kept as frontier markets at MSCI Inc. as the index
provider cited the countries’ dual account structures.  
 “The need to set up and operate with a dual account
structure is still a major concern to a number of international
institutional investors and is incompatible with general
emerging markets standards,” MSCI said in reference to the
U.A.E. International investors in Qatar’s market are also
concerned about “stringent foreign ownership limits,” the note
said.
