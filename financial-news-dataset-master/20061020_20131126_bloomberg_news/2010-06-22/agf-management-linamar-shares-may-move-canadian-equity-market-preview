             Canadian stocks  rose as near record
prices for gold drove up miners’ shares and BlackBerry maker
Research In Motion Ltd. rallied a day before its first-quarter
earnings report.  
 Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-biggest gold producer,
advanced 2.8 percent as the euro retreated against the U.S.
dollar for a fourth day. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s
largest bank, slid 1.2 percent after sales of new U.S. homes
sank a record 33 percent. RIM climbed 2.6 percent on comments
from analysts at Morgan Keegan & Co. and Morgan Stanley.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 9.56 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 11,807.50.  
 “The gold stocks are simply playing catch up to the rally
in the price of gold,” said Karl Berger, who helps oversee
C$300 million ($289 million) as a portfolio manager at Toron
Investment Management in Toronto. “We’ve seen a pretty
significant and sustained rise in the price of gold and not a
corresponding move in the gold share index.”  
 Demand for the precious metal has soared as investors
sought a haven from the credit crisis in Europe. Gold futures
rallied 8.2 percent over the seven months ending yesterday,
while the S&P/TSX Gold Index fell 0.4 percent. The index of  28
mining companies  gained 1.3 percent today even as the metal
slipped 0.5 percent.  
 Goldcorp advanced 2.8 percent to C$46.41 after announcing
its Penasquito project in Mexico is proceeding ahead of
schedule. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of
the metal, increased 1 percent to C$46.46. Kinross Gold Corp.,
the No. 3 producer in Canada, climbed 2.1 percent to C$18.92.  
 Profit Outlook  
 RIM, which  reports earnings  after the close of trading
tomorrow, rallied 2.6 percent to C$62.01.  
 Morgan Stanley analyst  Ehud Gelblum  wrote in a note today
that the profit Jabil Circuit Inc. reported yesterday bodes well
for RIM. Analyst  Tavis McCourt  of Morgan Keegan & Co. told
clients BlackBerry devices are maintaining market share against
smartphones using Google Inc.’s Android operating system “more
than investors seem to fear.”  
 Financial shares led a decline of as much as 0.6 percent in
the Canadian stock benchmark earlier in the day on concern that
economic growth in North America may stall.  
 U.S. sales of new homes dropped to 300,000 last month, the
fewest since at least 1963, the Commerce Department said today
in Washington. The median estimate among 76 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was 410,000. Sales contracts had to be signed
by April 30 to qualify for a tax credit, leading to the plunge
in May.  
 U.S. Trade  
 “A quarter of our economy is based on trade, and most of
that is with the United States,” said  James Cole , who manages
about C$900 million ($862 million) at Portland Investment
Counsel Inc. in Burlington, Ontario. “To the extent the U.S.
economy is strong or weak, you can have a commensurate impact in
Canada.”  
 In Canada, retail sales fell 2 percent in April, the most
since December 2008, as consumers bought fewer cars and new
clothes, Statistics Canada said today. Economists had forecast a
decline of 0.4 percent, according to the median of 17 estimates
in a  Bloomberg survey .  
 Royal Bank lost 1.2 percent to C$53.75. Bank of Montreal,
Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, retreated 1.1 percent to C$61.76.
 Financial holding company  Power Corp. of Canada decreased 1.8
percent to C$26.62.
