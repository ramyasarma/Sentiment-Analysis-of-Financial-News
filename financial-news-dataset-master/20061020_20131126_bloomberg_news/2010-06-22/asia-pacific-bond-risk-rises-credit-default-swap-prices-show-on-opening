             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 3 basis points to 121 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in Singapore, Barclays Plc prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 3 basis points to
116 basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc.  
 The Markit  iTraxx Japan index  rose 1.5 basis points to
121.5 basis points as of 8:48 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Morgan
Stanley. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the securities if a borrower
fails to meet its debt agreements.
