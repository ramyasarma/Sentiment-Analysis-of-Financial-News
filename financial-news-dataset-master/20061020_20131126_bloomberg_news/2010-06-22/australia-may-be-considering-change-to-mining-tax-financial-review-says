             The Australian government is
considering changes to its resource super profit tax, including
allowing a higher rate of return before the tax takes effect,
the Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where
it got the information. The government may scrap its exploration
rebate, estimated to be worth A$4 billion, to fund the changes,
the newspaper said.
