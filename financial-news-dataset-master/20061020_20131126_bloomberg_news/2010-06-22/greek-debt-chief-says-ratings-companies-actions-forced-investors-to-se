             Ratings actions forced investors to
cut holdings of Greek bonds, creating a market where there are
only sellers of the securities,  Petros Christodoulou , head of
the nation’s debt agency, said today at a conference in London.  
 The debt chief said he is optimistic Greece’s austerity
program will succeed and encourage investors to return to the
market, though that “won’t happen overnight.”
