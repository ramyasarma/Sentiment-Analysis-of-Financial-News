             The Australian Football League is
hoping to raise A$1 billion from the sale of its television
rights for the five years starting 2012, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing unidentified TV executives.
That price would be a 28 percent increase on the current deal
and comes as the government reviews a list of programs that
specifies what events must be broadcast on free-to-air
television, the newspaper said.
