             Walgreen Co. , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, said third-quarter profit declined 11 percent
as the company remodeled stores to spur sales growth. The shares
fell 6.5 percent.  
 Net income dropped to $463 million, or 47 cents a share,
from $522 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Walgreen said
today in a statement. Excluding certain costs, profit was 53
cents for the three months ended May 31. Analysts projected 58
cents, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 A sluggish economy and a slowdown in the introduction of
new generic drugs made the quarter challenging, Walgreen Chief
Executive Officer  Greg Wasson  said. The Deerfield, Illinois-
based company is working to reduce overhead expenses by $500
million this fiscal year, while spending as much as $55,000 a
store to convert the chain to a new format.  
 “We expected these headwinds and are continuing our
relentless focus on cost reductions,” Wasson said on a
conference call. Lowering shelves in stores and expanding
private-label goods will help boost sales next year, he said.  
 Walgreen fell $1.97 to $28.17 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have declined 23
percent this year.  
 Duane Reade  
 Sales at stores open at least a year rose less than 1
percent in the quarter, excluding the Duane Reade Holdings Inc.
chain that Walgreen purchased in April. Total  revenue  increased
6.1 percent to $17.2 billion.  
 The  acquisition  of Duane Reade, which has more than 250
outlets, shaved 2 cents a share from earnings. Changes in
Medicare reimbursement policies clipped profit by 4 cents.  
 Earnings in the year earlier period were boosted by sales
of over-the-counter remedies to fight the H1N1 flu virus.  
 CVS Caremark Corp. , the biggest distributor of prescription
drugs, and Walgreen resolved a dispute this month over
reimbursement policies at CVS Caremark’s benefits plans.
Walgreen had threatened to withdraw from CVS Caremark’s retail
pharmacy network, which has more than 64,000 stores.
