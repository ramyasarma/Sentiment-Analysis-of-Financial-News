             Gold may rebound from the biggest
slide in a month in London as speculation that European banks
will struggle to raise money increases demand for the precious
metal as a means of protecting wealth.  
 The metal dropped 1.8 percent yesterday after reaching a
record $1,265.30 an ounce. European Central Bank governing
council member  Christian Noyer  yesterday said some banks in the
16-nation euro region face funding difficulties. European
 equities  fell for the first time in 10 days.  
 “Gold continues to be seen as a safe haven against ongoing
debt default and inflation concerns,” said  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  
 Gold for immediate delivery added 75 cents, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,234.45 an ounce at 11:43 a.m. in London. The metal for
August delivery was 0.4 percent lower at $1,235.30 on the Comex
in New York.  
 Bullion slid to $1,235.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,254.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 The metal is up 13 percent this year and is headed for its
10th consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak since
at least 1920, amid speculation that debt-cutting measures by
European nations will slow growth. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  will deliver a speech on financial-market reform in
Berlin later today.  
 “Some banks have started facing increasing funding
problems,” the ECB’s Noyer said yesterday. “The situation
reflects a general state of uncertainty which, left unchecked,
could have significant consequences on financial stability.”  
 ‘Strong Demand’  
 Gold “is profiting from its status as a safe haven and is
likely to remain in strong demand as long as doubts persist
about the chances of successfully resolving the debt crisis in
Europe,”  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research with
Commerzbank AG, wrote in a report. “Investors are therefore
still trying to protect their investments with gold.”  
 The euro reached its strongest level in almost a month
against the dollar yesterday and most commodities gained after
China said it may allow the yuan to move higher, making raw
materials priced in other currencies less expensive for Chinese
consumers.  
 “Gold may come under additional pressure if greater
renminbi flexibility is seen as an indication that the Chinese
authorities envisage a more stable global economic climate,”
HSBC Securities analyst  James Steel  said in a report.  
 Assets in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, have risen 15 percent this year. The
holdings were unchanged at a record 1,307.96 metric tons
yesterday, the company’s website showed. Global  holdings  of the
metal by ETFs fell 0.5 ton to 2,044.4 tons yesterday, according
to Bloomberg data from 10 providers. That’s the first decline in
two weeks.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London was little changed
at $18.7225 an ounce. Platinum lost 0.1 percent to $1,586.65 an
ounce, and palladium was down 2.1 percent at $482.55 an ounce.
