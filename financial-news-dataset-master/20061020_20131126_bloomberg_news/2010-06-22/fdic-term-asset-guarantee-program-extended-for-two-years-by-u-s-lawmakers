             Congressional negotiators on the
financial-overhaul bill agreed to a two-year extension of a
program that gave companies unlimited insurance coverage for
non-interest bearing bank accounts during the credit crisis.  
 House negotiators last week proposed making permanent the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Term Asset Guarantee program,
which was started in 2008 to provide a backstop for the banking
industry. Senate conferees countered by offering a two-year
extension, which House members accepted today.  
 “It’s still needed due to the lingering impact of the
crisis,” FDIC Chairman  Sheila Bair  said today at a meeting in
Washington where the agency’s board voted to extend the program
through the end of this year.  
 Industry groups including the American Bankers Association
and the Independent Community Bankers of America pushed for an
extension of the program, which has been used by smaller firms
struggling with loan losses after the collapse of the U.S. real
estate market in 2007.  
 The FDIC has attempted to wean banks from the program by
increasing fees on participants, a step that prompted lenders
such as  Citigroup Inc.,   JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Wells Fargo &
Co., to opt out at the end of 2009.
