             Copper rose for a second day in New
York on speculation that a stronger yuan will boost demand from
China, the world’s largest metals consumer.  
 Copper gained as much as 5.1 percent yesterday after the
People’s Bank of China indicated it will abandon the yuan’s two-
year-old peg to the dollar. A rising Chinese currency will boost
China’s purchasing power, which may lead to an increase of
dollar-denominated imports.  
 “China’s move is bullish for commodities across the
board,” said Lannie Cohen, the president of Capitol Commodity
Services in Indianapolis.  
 Copper futures for September delivery climbed 5.1 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $3.0105 a pound on the Comex. Yesterday, the
commodity rose 2 percent, the most since June 14. On the London
Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months added $6, or
0.1 percent, to $6,610 a metric ton ($3 a pound), erasing
earlier losses of as much as 2 percent.  
 The dollar will drop over the second half of 2010, pushing
raw materials “significantly higher,” with copper surging to
as much as $4 by year-end, Cohen said.  
 Tin and zinc also gained on the LME. Aluminum, nickel and
lead fell.
