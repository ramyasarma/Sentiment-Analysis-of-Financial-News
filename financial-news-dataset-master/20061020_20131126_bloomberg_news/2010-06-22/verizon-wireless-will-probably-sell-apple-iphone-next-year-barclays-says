             Verizon Wireless , the biggest U.S.
mobile-phone carrier, will probably begin selling Apple Inc.’s
iPhone in early 2011, Barclays Plc said.  
 Sales of Apple’s device could boost Verizon’s subscriber
gains next year by 900,000 for a total of 2.8 million, said
 James Ratcliffe , a Barclays analyst, in a research note today.
He cut Verizon’s profit forecast for next year because of the
handset subsidies the company would use to lure customers.  
 Verizon is battling  AT&T Inc. , the exclusive U.S. seller of
the iPhone, for smartphone users willing to pay for mobile
Internet access in addition to phone calls. The iPhone had the
second-fastest growth worldwide among smartphone platforms in
the first quarter, trailing Google Inc.’s Android, according to
Gartner Inc. of Stamford, Connecticut.  
 “As the most popular handset in the marketplace, the
iPhone should help drive subscribership,” Ratcliffe said. “We
believe most of the activations will come from pent-up iPhone
demand from Verizon’s current subscriber base.”  
 Ratcliffe said his forecast for the iPhone debut on
Verizon’s network was based on research by Barclays
semiconductor analysts on activity in that industry.  
 Ivan Seidenberg , chief executive officer of Verizon
Wireless parent Verizon Communications Inc., repeated today the
mobile carrier is interested in offering the iPhone to its
customers.  
 “That decision’s really Apple’s,” Seidenberg said today
at an Economic Club of Washington event. “We stand ready to do
it, but that’s an Apple decision.”  
 Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for Apple, didn’t return an
e-mail message seeking comment.  Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman for
Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon Wireless, declined to
comment.  
 Verizon Communications, which co-owns Verizon Wireless with
Vodafone Group Plc, was unchanged at $29.06 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Cupertino, California-
based Apple climbed $3.68 to $273.85 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
