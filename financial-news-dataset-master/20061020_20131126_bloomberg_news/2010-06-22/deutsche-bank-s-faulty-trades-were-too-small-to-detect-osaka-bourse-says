             Deutsche Bank AG’s erroneous
trades that led to a plunge in Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average this month went through in part because they were too
small to trigger alerts, said Osaka Securities Exchange Co.  
 The spate of sell orders in Nikkei 225 futures preceded
a 1.1 percent drop in the gauge seconds after the market
opened on June 1. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank said on the
day that the trades occurred because of a system malfunction.  
 “Because it was an accumulation of many very small
orders,” the bourse was unable to detect them before some
were processed,  Michio Yoneda , president of the exchange,
said today at a press briefing. Osaka, 400 kilometers (250
miles) west of Tokyo, is home to Japan’s second-biggest
securities market.
