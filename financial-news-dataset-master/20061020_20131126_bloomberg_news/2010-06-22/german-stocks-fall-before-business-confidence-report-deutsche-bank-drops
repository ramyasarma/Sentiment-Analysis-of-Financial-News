             German stocks  dropped for a second
day after reports that showed purchases of new homes in the U.S.
plunged and growth in Europe’s services and manufacturing
industries slowed.  
 HeidelbergCement AG  led declines in the benchmark DAX
Index, falling 4.1 percent. E.ON AG retreated as German
electricity for delivery next year held steady at its lowest
price in more than a week.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  limited the
retreat as Citigroup Inc. lifted its price forecast on the
shares by 25 percent.  
 The  DAX  lost 1 percent to 6,204.52 as of in Frankfurt,
extending yesterday’s 0.4 percent drop. The index has still
rallied 9.4 percent since May 25 after concern about the impact
of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis pushed the measure near its
cheapest level relative to earnings in more than a year. The
broader HDAX Index also fell 1 percent today.  
 “Some leading indicators are pointing to more subdued
growth,” said  Markus Steinbeis , head of equity portfolio
management at the Unterfoehring, Germany-based unit of Pioneer
Investments, which oversees about $221 billion globally. “The
housing market is set for a kind of double dip, which will make
the market a bit nervous in the long term.”  
 U.S. Home Sales  
 U.S. new home sales collapsed a record 33 percent to an
annual pace of 300,000 last month from April, less than the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
fewest in data going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington. Demand in prior months
was revised down.  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries fell to 56
from 56.4 in May, London-based Markit Economics said today.
Economists had forecast a drop to 55.8, the median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  
 HeidelbergCement  slumped 4.1 percent to 42.90 euros.
Lafarge SA, HeidelbergCement, CRH Plc and Italcementi SpA are
among four global cement companies that have expressed interest
in buying India’s Murli Industries Ltd., the Business Standard
newspaper reported, citing two officials it didn’t identify.  
  E.ON , Germany’s biggest utility, dropped 1.8 percent to
23.77 euros. Baseload power for 2011 in Europe’s biggest market
slid as much as 0.9 percent to 53.35 euros a megawatt-hour, its
lowest level since June 14, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. It traded at 53.60 euros as of 11 a.m. Berlin time.  
 Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, slid 1.8 percent to
48.78 euros, while competitor Commerzbank declined 2.5 percent
to 6 euros.  
 Cartel Fine  
 Villeroy & Boch AG ’s preferred shares slumped 24 percent to
3.88 euros, the biggest decline on record. The German porcelain
maker founded in 1748, Sanitec Oyj, Grohe AG and 14 other
companies were fined a total of 622 million euros ($767 million)
today by the European Commission for colluding in a cartel on
prices for bathroom toilets, tubs and taps.  
 Lufthansa , Europe’s second-biggest airline, rallied 2.3
percent to 12.03 euros as Citigroup raised its price forecast to
19 euros from 15.20 euros.
