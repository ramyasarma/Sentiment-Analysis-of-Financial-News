             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month dollar loans may rise as a  European Central Bank 
rescue fund winds down, analysts at Barclays Capital said.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or  Libor , has remained
steady near 0.54 percent since late May, after rising from 0.25
basis points in early March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 “The recent period of calm in three-month Libor could be
coming to an abrupt end with rates potentially moving toward 75
basis points before settling close to 60 basis points or so,”
analysts led by  Joseph Abate  in New York wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  
 The ECB’s first and largest long-term refinancing operation
will expire July 1, according to Abate. The central bank will
replace the one-year funding with a three-month program,
prompting banks to seek alternative funding for as much as 150
billion euros ($185 billion), according to Barclays.  
 Banks have lodged 465 billion euros with the ECB through
monetary operations, including 170 billion euros in the main
refinancing operation. They pledged 468 billion euros of bonds
as collateral for ECB loans last year, up from about 441 billion
euros in 2008.
