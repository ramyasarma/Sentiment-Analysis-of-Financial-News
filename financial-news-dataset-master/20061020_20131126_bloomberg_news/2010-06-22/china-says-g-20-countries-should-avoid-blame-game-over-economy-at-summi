             China said countries attending the
Group of 20 leaders’ summit in Toronto this week should avoid
the “blame game” of placing responsibility for economic
difficulties on others, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang said.  
 Qin, responding to a question about whether President  Hu Jintao  will talk about China’s new yuan policy in Toronto, said
no G-20 summit had ever singled out a country’s currency as a
discussion topic. China will “steadily advance” its policy of
a more flexible exchange rate, Qin said.  
 “The G-20 summit should discuss how to step up
communication and cooperation to protect, maintain and push
forward the world economic recovery,” he told reporters in
Beijing. Countries shouldn’t put “pressure” on others.  
 China ended the yuan’s two-year peg to the U.S. dollar
after a June 19 announcement by the central bank that the
currency would be more flexible. The move came under criticism
by some U.S. lawmakers, including Senator  Charles Schumer , a New
York Democrat, who called the move insufficient.  
 The yuan advanced 0.42 percent to 6.7976 per dollar
yesterday, the most since July 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It weakened 0.2 percent today to 6.81, the most
since December 2008. The yuan may climb to 6.7 per dollar by Dec.
31, according to a Bloomberg analyst survey on June 20.  
 Hu will attend the June 26-27 summit in Toronto, part of a
trip to Canada that begins on June 23.
