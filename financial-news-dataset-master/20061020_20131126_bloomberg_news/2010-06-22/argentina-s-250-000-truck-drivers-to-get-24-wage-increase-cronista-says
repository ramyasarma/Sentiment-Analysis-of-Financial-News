             Argentina’s 250,000 truck drivers 
will receive an average wage increase of 24 percent in an 
agreement to be signed today, El Cronista said, without saying 
where it obtained the information.   
 The raise will be paid in three installments, the Buenos 
Aires-based newspaper said. The lowest paid workers in the 
industry will receive a minimum salary of 5000 pesos ($1,274) 
after the agreement is implemented, El Cronista said.
