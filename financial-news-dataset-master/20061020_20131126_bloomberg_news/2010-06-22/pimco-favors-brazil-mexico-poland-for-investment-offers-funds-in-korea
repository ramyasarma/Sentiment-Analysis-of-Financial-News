             Pacific Investment Management Co.,
manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, favors Brazil, Mexico,
South Korea, Poland and Russia for investment as they have low
debt levels and “strong” growth trajectories.  
 “There’s a fairly healthy growth outlook for Korea,”
 Christopher Getter , senior vice president at Pimco, said at a
briefing in Seoul after Pimco announced plans to start offering
bond funds in the nation for the first time.  
 The 15 types of fund include the $227.9 billion  Total
Return Fund , Pimco said. Newport Beach, California-based Pimco,
has Asian offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo, according
to its  website .  
 Pimco was ready for a stronger yuan, so doesn’t need to
alter its strategy after China signaled it would scrap a peg to
the dollar. The yuan rose the most in five years yesterday after
the central bank said June 19 it would increase the currency’s
flexibility.  
 “We have been positioned in our portfolios for
appreciation of yuan over the last several quarters,”  Brian Baker , chief executive officer of Pimco Asia Ltd., said at the
briefing. “So our positioning really doesn’t change.”
