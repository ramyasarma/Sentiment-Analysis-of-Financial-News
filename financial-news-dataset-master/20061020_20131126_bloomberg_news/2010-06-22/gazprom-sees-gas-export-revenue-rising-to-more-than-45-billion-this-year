             OAO Gazprom , the world’s biggest gas
producer, cut its export target for the year by about 10 percent
after southern Europe’s debt crisis caused demand to slump.  
 Russia’s gas export monopoly plans to ship more than 145
billion cubic meters of fuel this year from 140.6 billion cubic
meters last year, Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Alexander Medvedev  told reporters today in Moscow.  
 That’s a drop from January, when the company said it aimed
to ship 160.8 billion cubic meters to European customers outside
the former Soviet Union.  
 “We based our initial plans on positive trends we started
to witness last year, and expected a faster recovery of
demand,” Medvedev said.  
 Gazprom, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s gas,
may miss its output target this year after consumption in
southern Europe declined sharply, stalling a recovery, CEO
 Alexei Miller  said on June 18. Northern European demand has
continued to rise, he said.  
 Output is planned to rise to 519.3 billion cubic meters of
gas this year, after slumping to 462 billion cubic meters last
year. This month, Gazprom returned to an earlier annual forecast
after Miller raised it to 529 billion in April.  
 Foreign gas sales may exceed $45 billion this year, rising
from $42.5 billion last year, according to a presentation today
by Medvedev. Gazprom expects an average export price to Europe
at $308 per 1,000 cubic meters this year, Medvedev said.
