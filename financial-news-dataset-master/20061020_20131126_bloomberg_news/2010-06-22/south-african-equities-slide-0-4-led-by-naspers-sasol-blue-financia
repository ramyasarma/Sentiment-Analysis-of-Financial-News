             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell 111.82, or 0.4 percent, to 27,917.51 at the
close in Johannesburg.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Blue Financial Services Ltd.  (BFS SJ), a provider of
unsecured loans, fell for a third day, declining 2 cents, or 14
percent, to 12 cents. Blue’s listing could be under threat of
suspension or termination because the auditor’s report on the
company’s earnings for the year ended February was disclaimed,
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said. Blue reported a full-year
loss of 1.02 billion rand ($135 million) yesterday and said its
liabilities exceeded assets after impairments on loans in 13
African countries increased and as costs surged.  
 Gijima Ast Group Ltd . (GIJ SJ), a computer-services
company, rose the most in almost a month, gaining 3 cents, or
3.7 percent, to 85 cents. The company issued 300 million rand in
new debentures as part of a restructuring of debt under its
debtors’ securitization program.  
 Medi-Clinic Corp. Ltd.  (MDC SJ), South Africa’s second-
largest publicly traded private hospital owner by market value,
fell by the most in more than three months, declining 99 cents,
or 3.6 percent, to 26.31 rand. The company said after share
trading closed yesterday that it plans to raise 1.4 billion rand
selling stock to existing investors. Medi-Clinic was downgraded
to “underperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ), Africa’s biggest media company,
declined the most in three months, sliding 15.55 rand, or 5.6
percent, to 262.95 rand. Tencent Holdings Ltd., a provider of
Internet value-added services which is 35 percent owned by
Naspers, dropped 4.7 percent to HK$126 in Hong Kong after
China’s Ministry of Culture said it ordered a ban on Internet
game operators offering virtual-currency services to minors.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, fell by the most since June 4, declining 5.50
rand, or 1.9 percent, to 290.50 rand. Oil retreated as much as
1.7 percent to $76.53 a barrel in New York.
