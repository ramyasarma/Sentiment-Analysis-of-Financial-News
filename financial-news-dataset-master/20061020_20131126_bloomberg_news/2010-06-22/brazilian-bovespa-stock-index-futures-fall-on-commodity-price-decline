             Brazilian stocks  gained, led by
steelmakers and homebuilders, after the fastest expansion in
bank lending in 10 months bolstered the economic outlook.  
 Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA , the biggest
supplier of steel to Brazil’s auto industry, jumped 3.8 percent.
 MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA  led gains for homebuilders as
bank loans grew without hurting credit quality. Water utility
 Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo  led gains on
the index after Bank of America Corp. advised buying the stock.  
 “What prevailed today was the perception that Brazil is
going to have strong growth for years to come,” said  Roni Lacerda , who helps manage 2.4 billion reais ($1.3 billion) at
Mercatto Gestao de Recursos in Rio de Janeiro. “You’ve been
seeing some short-term decoupling in Brazil.”  
 The Bovespa rose 0.5 percent to 65,160.33, erasing an
earlier loss that pushed the measure down 0.9 percent. Forty-
five stocks rose on the index while 19 fell. The  BM&FBovespa
Small Cap index  gained 0.6 percent to 1,169.93. The real added
0.1 percent to 1.7863, compared with 1.7880 yesterday.  
 State and non-state bank lending increased 2.1 percent to
1.5 trillion reais ($830 billion) from a revised 1.47 trillion
reais in April, the central bank said today in Brasilia. Average
default rates remained at 5.1 percent in May, the same level
since March, the bank said. Average interest rates rose to 34.9
percent in May, from 34.3 percent in April, the bank said.  
 Homebuilders Gain  
 Usiminas rose to 49.32 reais, the highest price since May
14. MRV climbed 3.4 percent to 13.49 reais, the highest price
since March.  Rossi Residencial SA , Brazil’s sixth biggest
homebuilders by revenue, jumped 2.3 percent to 14.03 reais.  
 Sabesp soared 4.1 percent to 36.05 reais, the most in more
than a month. Bank of America raised its rating on the stock to
“buy” from “underperform,” citing positive costs trends and
development opportunities in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s
largest.  
 Brazilian stocks rebounded from earlier losses after
purchases of new homes in the U.S. fell in May to a record low.  
 U.S. sales collapsed a record 33 percent to an annual pace
of 300,000 last month from April, less than the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data
going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce Department showed.
The U.S. is Brazil’s second-biggest trade partner after China.  
 Petrobras Uncertainty  
 Petrobras slid 2.1 percent to 28.50 reais after saying it
will delay the deal until September because a price hasn’t been
set on a purchasing oil reserves from the government. The
offering is tied buy rights to as much as 5 billion barrels of
oil from Brazil with stock. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras said
in a statement yesterday regulators will assess the value of
such reserves by the end of August.  
 Petrobras needs the proceeds from the sale to complete the
2010 portion of its $224 billion investment plan, said  Anisa Redman , an oil analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in London, and
 Ricardo Cavanagh  from Raymond James in Buenos Aires. The delay
increases the risk that the sale will be further postponed
because of the presidential election in October, Redman said.  
 The “bottom line is that the overhang and the
uncertainties will now take longer,” Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts in a e-mail to clients today. “In that sense,
therefore, the postponement is negative for the stock.”  
 Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias dropped 2.8 percent to 35.20
reais. Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA will sell the stake
for about 990 million reais ($549.4 million) to existing CCR
shareholders, according to a regulatory filing.  
 Tele Norte  Leste  Participacoes SA, which rallied yesterday
on speculation the company may be an acquisition target for
Portugal Telecom SGPS SA., fell 1.8 percent to 28.56 reais.  
 Portugal Telecom SGPS hasn’t had any talks with Brazil’s
Tele Norte Leste, known as Oi, on a possible agreement or deal,
the Portuguese company’s chairman Henrique Granadeiro said in an
interview with Economico TV today.
