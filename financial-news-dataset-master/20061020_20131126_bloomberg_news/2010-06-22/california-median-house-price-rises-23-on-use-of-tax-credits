             California house prices rose 23
percent in May from a year earlier as homebuyers took advantage
of government tax credits, the state’s Realtors group said.  
 The median  price  of an existing single-family home was
$324,430, the California Association of Realtors said today in a
statement. It was the fifth straight monthly increase of at
least 10 percent, the Los Angeles-based group said. Prices rose
5.9 percent from April.  
 California home prices were helped by homebuyer tax
credits, the association said. To qualify for a federal credit,
buyers were required to sign a contract by April 30 and complete
the purchase by July 1. A state credit of as much as $10,000
began May 1.  
 The price gains indicated “strong buyer demand relative to
the supply of homes for sale,” said Steve Goddard, president of
the association.  
 May sales of existing California houses rose 1.2 percent on
a seasonally adjusted basis from a year earlier and 14 percent
from April, the  Realtors association  said.  
 The median time it took to sell a California house dropped
to 39.8 days in May from 52.4 days a year earlier, the Realtors
group said. The association’s index of unsold inventory was 4.6
months, unchanged from May 2009. The index shows the time needed
to deplete the supply of homes on the market at the current
sales rate.
