             Young children of women who, during
pregnancy, lived near masts that transmit mobile-phone signals
don’t have a higher risk of cancer, a U.K. study found.  
 Researchers from  Imperial College London  reviewed
information on almost 7,000 children younger than 5, including
1,397 with cancer. They found no link between the mother’s
exposure during pregnancy to a mobile-phone mast and the risk of
cancers including leukemia and brain tumors, according to the
study published today in the  British Medical Journal .  
 The study is the largest of its kind, and the findings
should put any reports of cancer clusters around mobile-phone
towers into context, the researchers wrote. Doctors should tell
patients not to worry about living near masts, said John
Bithell, an honorary research fellow with the Childhood Cancer
Research Group at  University of Oxford .  
 “Moving away from a mast, with all its stresses and costs,
cannot be justified on health grounds in the light of current
evidence,” Bithell wrote in an accompanying editorial.  
 The researchers identified the cancer cases from a U.K.
patient database and determined the child’s address at birth.
For each case, they found four children born around the same
time and in the same area using a birth registry. They obtained
data on the location and power of mobile-phone masts between
1996 and 2001 from the four major phone operators in the U.K.:
 Vodafone Group Plc , Telefonica SA’s O2,  France Telecom SA ’s
Orange and Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile.  
 The study was funded by the  U.K. Mobile Telecommunications
Health Research Programme , a body set up to provide money for
research into the possible health effects of mobile
telecommunications. The organization is jointly funded by the
U.K. Department of Health and the mobile telecommunications
industry.
