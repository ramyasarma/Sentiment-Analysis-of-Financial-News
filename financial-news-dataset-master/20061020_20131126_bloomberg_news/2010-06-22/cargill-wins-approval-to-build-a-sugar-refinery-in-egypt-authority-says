             Cargill Inc., the largest U.S.
agricultural company, won approval to build a sugar refinery in
Egypt, the country’s Industrial Development Authority said.  
 The facility will have an initial investment cost of 400
million Egyptian pounds ($70.5 million) and is scheduled to
start operations in 2012, Amr Assal, chairman of the agency,
said yesterday in an interview in Cairo.  
 “There is huge demand for sugar in Egypt,” Assal said.
“So there are a lot of opportunities for refineries whether for
the domestic market or for export.”  
 Cargill, based in Minneapolis, was allocated land in the
northern Egyptian city of Borg El Arab as its request for a
permission to set up the factory was approved by the industrial
development authority, Assal said.  
 The state-run Food Industries Holding Co. and Al Nouran
Holding Co., a private sugar refiner in Egypt, have applied for
licenses to set up plants in the North African country, Assal
said.  
 Consumption of sugar in Egypt, the Arab world’s most
populous country, is between 2.8 million and 2.9 million tons
per year, according to the largest state importer, Sugar and
Integrated Industries Co.  
 Local farmers supply between 1.8 million and 1.9 million
tons annually and the rest is imported.
