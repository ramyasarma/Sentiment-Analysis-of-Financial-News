             BP Plc  closed at its lowest since
February 1997 in London on concern the company’s oil spill
cleanup operation in the Gulf of Mexico may be disrupted by bad
weather.  
 BP  fell  4.4 percent to 334.20 pence today after dropping to
its lowest since November 1996 in intraday trading. It has
declined 49 percent since the April 20 accident on the Deepwater
Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and started the leak, erasing
60 billion pounds ($89 billion) off the company’s market value.  
 The first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season may enter
the Gulf of Mexico as soon as next week, meteorologist  Jim Rouiller  said, and forecasters are predicting the season may be
among the worst on record. BP increased its recovery rate of
leaking oil as costs of responding to the worst spill in U.S.
history rose to $2 billion.  
 BP has two pipes collecting oil and gas from the ocean
floor to bring to the surface. They collected 25,830 barrels of
oil yesterday, the biggest quantity diverted from the Gulf since
the spill began, BP said today in a statement on its website.  
 The company plans to raise capacity to as much as 53,000
barrels a day about June 30 using the floating riser and an
offshore production vessel expected to be less vulnerable to
storms. BP’s main oil recovery vessel, a drill ship, has twice
shut down because of thunderstorms.  
 Two relief wells, which will stop the oil flow of oil
permanently, are scheduled for completion in August.

                     June 22 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Ward, chief executive officer of Lloyd’s of London, talks about the insurance market's exposure to claims from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and insurance rates for offshore drilling rigs in the region.
     Ward, speaking on Bloomberg Television's “InBusiness With Margaret Brennnan,” also discusses U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron's plan to impose a levy on banks and raise the sales tax in what the government called its biggest peacetime deficit cut.
