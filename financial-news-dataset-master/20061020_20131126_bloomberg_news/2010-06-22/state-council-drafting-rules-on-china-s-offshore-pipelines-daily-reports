             China is drafting regulations to
ensure the safety of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines, the
China Daily reported today, citing unidentified people familiar
with the situation.  
 The Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, the
National Energy Bureau and the State Oceanic Administration are
drafting the detailed regulations, the Beijing-based English-
language newspaper reported.  
 The latest draft of a law on oil and natural gas pipelines,
submitted to the China’s top legislative body for review
yesterday, would authorize the State Council to create detailed
regulations on the safety of pipelines, according to the report.
