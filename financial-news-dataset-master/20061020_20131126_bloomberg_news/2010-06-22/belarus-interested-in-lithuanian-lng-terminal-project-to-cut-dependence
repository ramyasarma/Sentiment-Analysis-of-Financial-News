             Belarus is “interested” in
neighboring Lithuania’s liquefied natural gas terminal project
as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas.  
 Belarus wants to diversify its gas imports through
alternative routes, the Lithuanian Energy Ministry said in a
statement today from Vilnius, citing Belarus Energy Minister
Aleksandr Ozerac.  
 OAO Gazprom  , Russia’s gas-export monopoly, cut supplies to
Belarus by 30 percent today after a 15 percent reduction
yesterday as talks about unpaid gas supply and transit failed.
Lithuania plans to decide on capacity and the site for
construction of the LNG terminal this year, the ministry said.  
 “Incidents such as the dispute in Belarus make us more
convinced we should have an LNG terminal,” Prime Minister
 Andrius Kubilius  told reporters in London today. Lithuania isn’t
yet feeling the impact of a reduction in gas flows to Belarus
from Russia, he said.  
 Belgium’s Exmar NV and two U.S. companies, SAIC Inc. and
Excelerate Energy LLC, are studying the feasibility of an LNG
terminal in Lithuania, the Energy Ministry said in March
