             Delek Group Ltd., an Israeli company
controlled by billionaire  Isaac Tshuva , reached an agreement on
buying fuel and convenience stores in France from  BP Plc  as the
U.K. company battles the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 The companies will complete the deal once it gets
regulatory approval,  Delek Group  said today in a statement to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Delek Europe BV in February
proposed to pay 180 million euros ($249 million)in cash for BP’s
416 gas stations in France.  
 Delek has outlets in Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg as well as stations in Israel and the U.S. The BP
brand would remain on the stores for several years as part of a
deal scheduled for completion in the second half, the U.K.
company said in February.  
 The talks started before the April 20 rig explosion in the
U.S. Gulf, which has prompted BP to set aside $20 billion to
help pay for costs. Tshuva, whose company is a partner in
Israel’s largest gas find in Mediterranean waters, told
Bloomberg in April that the company plans to expand in the
energy sector.
