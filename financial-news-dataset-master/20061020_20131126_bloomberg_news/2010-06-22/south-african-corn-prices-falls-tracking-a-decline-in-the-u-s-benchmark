             Corn in South Africa, the
continent’s biggest producer of the grain, fell after prices
dropped in the U.S., which competes for African export markets.  
 Corn for December delivery declined 1.5 percent to $3.7475
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday.  
 White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, slid 15 rand, or 1.4
percent, to 1,050 rand ($140) a metric ton at 9:53 a.m.
Johannesburg time. Meal made from the grain is the country’s
staple food.  
 Yellow corn for July delivery fell 12 rand, or 1.1 percent,
to 1,103 rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as animal feed in
South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among the biggest corn
exporters.  
 Wheat for July delivery rose 1 rand to 2,304 rand a ton.
Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are Africa’s largest wheat growers.
