             Benetton family infrastructure
vehicle Sintonia SA may invest as much as 1 billion euros to buy
about 10 percent of Enel Green Power when parent Enel SpA sells
shares in an initial public offering, la Repubblica reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Enel on June 18 filed a request with the Italian stock
exchange for an IPO as soon as October.
