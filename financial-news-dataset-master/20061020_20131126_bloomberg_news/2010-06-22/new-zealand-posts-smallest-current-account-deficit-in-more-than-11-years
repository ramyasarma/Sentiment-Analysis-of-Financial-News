             (Corrects to say current-account deficit narrowed to
smallest in 21 years in lead.)  
 New Zealand’s annual current-account
deficit narrowed to the smallest in more than 21 years as the
profits of foreign-owned companies declined.  
 The shortfall shrank to NZ$4.46 billion ($3.1 billion) in
the 12 months ended March 31 from a revised NZ$5.31 billion in
the year through December, Statistics New Zealand said in
Wellington today.  
 In the three months ended March 31, there was a current-
account surplus of NZ$176 million, compared with a revised
NZ$3.41 billion shortfall in the fourth quarter. Economists
expected a NZ$550 million deficit.
