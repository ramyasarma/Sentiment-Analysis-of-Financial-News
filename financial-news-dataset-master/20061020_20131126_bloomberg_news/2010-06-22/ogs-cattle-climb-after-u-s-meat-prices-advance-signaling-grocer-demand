             Hog futures rose to a five-week high
as a rebound in pork prices signaled U.S. demand may increase
for summer grilling. Cattle fell, erasing earlier gains.  
 Wholesale pork  has climbed 3.6 percent since touching a
two-month low on June 16, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Grocers may stock up on lower-priced meat as consumer
demand climbs before the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July
4.  
 “It feels like we’ve moved to a level where we’re finding
some support,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “Packers are killing
now for the Fourth of July.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement climbed 0.15 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 84.5 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 85.1 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since May 14. Hogs are up 39
percent in the past year.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery declined 0.525 cent, or
0.6 percent, to 88.8 cents a pound. The commodity rose as much
as 1 percent earlier to 90.25 cents, the highest price since
June 4. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement inched up
0.125 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.11825 a pound.  
 Cattle fell and hogs pared gains after the Canadian
government said livestock at a packing plant in Alberta tested
negative for foot and mouth disease, said  Troy Vetterkind , the
owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago. The highly
contagious illness can be fatal to young animals and might have
reduced U.S. meat supplies, he said.  
 “If you take the threat of a problem away, you’re going to
get a pullback in futures,” Vetterkind said. “If Canada had
gotten foot and mouth, I’d assume the USDA would close the
border until they got it under control. We get a lot of cattle
and hogs out of Canada.”  
 Wholesale- choice beef  was little changed at midday at
$1.5472 a pound, after rebounding 1 percent from a three-month
low on June 14.
