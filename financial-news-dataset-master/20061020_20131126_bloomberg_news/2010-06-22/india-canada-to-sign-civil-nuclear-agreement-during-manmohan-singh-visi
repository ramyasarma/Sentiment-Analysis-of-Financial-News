             India and Canada are set to sign a
civilian nuclear energy agreement this weekend that will allow
the South Asian nation to secure uranium, and nuclear equipment
and technology to meet its energy needs.  
 The accord is expected to be initialed during Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s stay in Toronto for the G-20 summit
from June 26.  
 Negotiations have made “substantial progress” and the
agreement is waiting for approval by both sides, Vivek Katju, a
secretary at India’s foreign ministry, said in New Delhi today.
“The agreement will cover the large ambit of peaceful nuclear
applications.”  
 Asia’s third-biggest energy consumer needs uranium, boilers,
reactors and turbines as it plans to raise nuclear generation
capacity 10-fold over the next decade to sustain its economic
 growth .  
 A three-decade ban on nuclear supplies to the country was
lifted in September 2008, following which the government has
signed civil nuclear agreements with countries including U.S.,
Russia, France and Namibia.
