             Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, may delay plans to sell as much as
$25 billion of shares to minority investors beyond July while
the government sets a price on crude reserves, Senator  Delcidio Amaral  said.  
 Brazil’s national oil regulator, known as the ANP, said
today it chose a firm to assess the value of reserves in an
offshore region known as the pre-salt by the end of August. The
reserves are part of a government plan to swap the rights to as
much as 5 billion barrels of oil near the Americas’ largest
discovery in three decades in exchange for new Petrobras stock.  
 “Now there are 60 days until the price comes out,” Amaral
told reporters today in Brasilia. “There could be a delay in
the capitalization.”  
 Petrobras said earlier this month it planned to sell shares
before the end of July after carrying out a book-building
process with investors to set the price of the shares. Chief
Executive Officer  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said earlier today on a
conference call that the date of the share sale will depend on
the certification from the oil regulator.  
 “We are dependent on the decision of the ANP right now,”
Gabrielli said when asked about the July deadline.  
 Petrobras  fell 29 centavos, or 1 percent, to 29.11 reais in
Sao Paulo trading today. The stock has declined 5.7 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with a 31 percent gain for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.
