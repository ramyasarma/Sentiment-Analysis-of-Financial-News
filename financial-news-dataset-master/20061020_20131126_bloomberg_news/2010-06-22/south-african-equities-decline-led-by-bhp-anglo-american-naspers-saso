             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  lost 183.12, or 0.7 percent, to 27,846.21 by 10:25
a.m. in Johannesburg, paring its gain this month to 2.6 percent.
The measure is still on track for its first monthly increase in
three months.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, retreated 2.40 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 221.94 rand.
 Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ) slid 69 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
300.51 rand. Copper fell as much as 2 percent to $6,470 a metric
ton, paring yesterday’s 2.6 percent gain.  
 Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ), Africa’s biggest media company,
declined the most in almost two weeks, sliding 10.50 rand, or
3.8 percent to 268 rand. Tencent Holdings Ltd., (700 HK), the
provider of Internet value-added services which is 35 percent
owned by Naspers, dropped 4.7 percent to HK$126 in Hong Kong
after China’s Ministry of Culture said it ordered a ban on
Internet game operators offering virtual-currency services to
minors.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, slid 2.94 rand, or 1 percent, to 293.06 rand,
paring yesterday’s 3.6 percent gain. Crude oil declined for the
first time in three days as optimism faded that China’s plan to
add more flexibility in the yuan’s fixed exchange rate would
strengthen the global economic recovery.
