             Japanese stocks  fell the most in two
weeks after Fitch Ratings downgraded Paris-based BNP Paribas SA
and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said Spanish lenders face
years of difficulty because of the nation’s slow growth.  
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
sales from Europe, dropped 2.7 percent as the euro weakened
against the dollar, clouding its earnings outlook.  Mitsui & Co. ,
which counts commodities as its biggest source of profit, fell
2.9 percent as oil prices slid. Fanuc Ltd., which makes
industrial robots, sank 3.3 percent after the stock climbed to a
two-month high yesterday.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid 1.2 percent to close at
10,112.89 in Tokyo. The broader  Topix index  lost 0.9 percent to
894.56. The declines were the biggest since June 7 for the
Nikkei 225 and June 9 for the Topix. The broader measure has
fallen 10 percent from a 52-week high on April 15 after Spain,
Portugal and Greece had their credit ratings cut by Standard &
Poor’s in April as stimulus spending swelled their deficits.  
 “Europe’s problems still haven’t been solved and people
are in no mood to take on risk,” said  Hiroshi Morikawa , a
strategist in Tokyo at MU Investments Co., which manages about
$14 billion. “Investors are worried that developed nations
won’t be able to support their economies with any large-scale
loosening of monetary and fiscal policies” because of rising
government debt.  
 Both benchmark gauges surged more than 2 percent yesterday,
their sharpest advance since June 3, after China’s central bank
said on June 19 that the exchange rate will be allowed increased
“flexibility.” The advance raised the average price of shares
in the Topix to 17.3 times  estimated earnings , up from an 18-
month low of 16.4 times on June 9.  
 Spanish Banks  
 “Today’s decline will be a brief pause, given that there
have been sharp advances in Japanese and U.S. markets,” said
 Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tokyo-based
Tachibana Securities Co.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dipped 0.2
percent. Yesterday, the gauge erased its early gain in the final
hour of trading to close down 0.4 percent in New York.  
 Fitch cut its long-term credit rating on BNP Paribas,
France’s largest bank, by one step to AA-, citing a
“deterioration” of the company’s asset quality. The report
came as Standard & Poor’s slashed its economic growth forecast
for Spain to an average of 0.7 percent a year through 2016 from
1 percent, saying Spanish banks face mounting credit losses and
“substantial strain” on revenue generation.  
 Nintendo, Fanuc  
 Japanese companies depending on demand in Europe retreated
as the euro weakened and reduced the value of their sales in the
region. Canon, the world’s biggest maker of digital cameras,
lost 2.7 percent to 3,780 yen and was the  heaviest drag  on the
Topix, followed by Nintendo Co. Nintendo, a game-machine maker
that derives 34 percent of its revenue from Europe, declined 3.4
percent to 28,300 yen in Osaka.  
 The euro depreciated to as low as 111.61 per yen today from
113.01 at the 3 p.m. close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.  
 Spurred by the European sovereign-debt crisis, Japan today
pledged to balance its budget in 10 years as government
borrowings relative to the nation’s economic output are the
largest among developed economies. The government said today it
will restrict bond sales and overhaul the tax system as part of
its fiscal strategy.  
 Mitsui, the nation’s No. 2 trading house by market value,
fell 2.9 percent to 1,175 yen.  Inpex Corp. , Japan’s largest oil
and gas explorer, lost 2.8 percent to 550,000 yen. Crude oil for
July delivery dropped as much as 1.1 percent today.  
 Fanuc slumped 3.3 percent to 10,990 yen and  accounted  for
12 percent of the Nikkei 225’s drop. The stock soared 5.5
percent yesterday, driving its 14-day relative strength index
above 70, the threshold that some traders use as a signal to
sell.
