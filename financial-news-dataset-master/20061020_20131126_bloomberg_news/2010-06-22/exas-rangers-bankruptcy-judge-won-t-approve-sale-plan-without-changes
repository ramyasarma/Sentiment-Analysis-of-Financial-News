             The Texas Rangers’ bankruptcy plan
can’t win court approval without the support of the team’s
lenders unless it is modified, a judge ruled.  
 The plan as proposed, which is based on a sale of the team,
“will not be confirmable absent acceptance by the lenders,”
Judge  D. Michael Lynn  in Fort Worth, Texas, said in a 28-page
decision released today. The judge said the plan can be approved
with changes and if it’s accepted by two companies that hold the
team’s equity.  
 The lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., oppose the
proposed sale of the Rangers to a group led by Chuck Greenberg
and  Nolan Ryan . They say the team rejected a higher offer from
Houston businessman  Jim Crane .  
 Lynn is scheduled to hold a hearing in the case later
today.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).
