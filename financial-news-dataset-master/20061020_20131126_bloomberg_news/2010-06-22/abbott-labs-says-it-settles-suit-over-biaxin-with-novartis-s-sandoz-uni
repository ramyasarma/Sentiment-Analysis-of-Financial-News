             Abbott Laboratories  said it settled
a patent-infringement suit against Novartis AG’s Sandoz over a
generic version of the antibiotic Biaxin XL.  
 Terms of the accord, which eliminates the need for a trial
that was set to start today in federal court in Chicago, are
confidential, said  Scott Stoffel , an Abbott spokesman. The
lawsuit was filed in 2005.  
 The drug, known by its chemical name of clarithromycin,
already has competition from generic-drug makers  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Abbott’s sales from Biaxin fell to $14 million in the U.S. in
2008 from $458 million in 2004, when there was no competition
for either the extended- or immediate-release dosages, according
to the company’s annual reports.  
 Abbott sought to recoup some of the lost sales and prevent
Sandoz from selling its copy until a patent expires in 2017.
Abbott no longer reports Biaxin’s sales.  
 Pamela McKinlay , a spokeswoman for Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis, said she couldn’t immediately comment on the report of
a settlement.  
 Sandoz, the world’s second-biggest maker of generic drugs,
began selling a version of Biaxin in December 2006 and was
ordered to stop four months later. Teva and Watson are licensed
to sell generic-drug copies under settlements reached with
Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott.  
 The case is Abbott Laboratories v. Sandoz Inc., 05-5373,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).
