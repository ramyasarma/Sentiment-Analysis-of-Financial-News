             President  Barack Obama  needs to make
sure China lives up to its commitment to revalue its currency,
Senator  Sherrod Brown  said.  
 “China has been great at gaming the system,” on trade,
Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. The president “shouldn’t just check the box” and
view the matter as closed, he said.  
 Legislation that would let U.S. companies get higher
tariffs on imports to compensate for a weak Chinese currency is
still necessary, Brown, a cosponsor of the measure, said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s Washington office. China said on June
19 that it was lifting a two-year policy of pegging its
currency, the yuan, to the U.S. dollar.  
 “The pressure still needs to be on them from Congress,”
Brown said. “If we move forward on an amendment on currency on
the Senate floor, our prospects for passage are pretty good.”  
 The yuan weakened 0.23 percent to 6.8136 per dollar as of
5:30 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade system. Yesterday it climbed the most since a July 2005
revaluation.
