             Nobel Prize-winning economist  Paul Krugman  said inflation isn’t a threat and the global economy
needs more stimulus at a time when governments are concerned
about mounting debt.  
 “The crisis is not behind us if we look at what matters
most -- jobs,” Krugman said at an economic conference today in
Tel Aviv. “Inflation is subdued to say the least. Inflation
tends to decline when you have higher unemployment.”  
 Krugman said that a period of deflation, or a general
decline in prices, is possible within the next few years.  
 Federal Reserve  policy makers meeting today and tomorrow
are projected to commit to keeping interest rates near zero in
coming months to help wean the world’s largest economy off
government stimulus. The hazard posed by the European  debt 
crisis, joblessness near a 26-year high and a lack of inflation
add to the reasons why central bankers will focus on sustaining
the economic rebound.  
 “To short-change stimulus now for the sake of the long-run
budget just doesn’t add up,” Krugman said in response to a
question from the audience. “Now is the time when we really
need the government support. Unfortunately, pulling back is what
seems to be happening,” he said.  
 Governments across the 16-nation euro region are cutting
spending after Greece’s near default sparked investor concern
that budget deficits are spiraling out of control. While tighter
fiscal policy may slow economic growth, the crisis has also
pushed the euro down 13 percent against the dollar this year,
boosting some European exports.  
 Europe’s Exports  
 “The risks are more on the downside for the euro,”
Krugman said. Even at the current exchange rate, he said, euro
region exporters including Germany are “extremely
competitive.”  
 Germany’s cabinet this month backed budget cuts worth more
than 80 billion euros through 2014. Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
said she expects to have a “hard time” at the Group of 20
summit in Toronto on June 26-27 as other leaders press her to
focus on economic growth. They will tell her “Germany saves too
much,” she said June 11, adding she’ll respond that “there is
no alternative” to cutting the deficit.  
 “On the inflation side, the Germans do worry a lot about
inflation and basically that’s because they’re crazy,” Krugman
said during the question-and-answer period. “It’s just not
going to happen with a massively depressed economy.”
