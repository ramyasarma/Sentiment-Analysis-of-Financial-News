             South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress said it “will not be the best route to take”
to charge Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, for alleging that some ANC leaders
were corrupt.  
 The ANC called on its labor ally to end public spats and to
refrain from making allegations of corruption against ANC
leaders without facts, the ruling party said in an e-mailed
statement today.
