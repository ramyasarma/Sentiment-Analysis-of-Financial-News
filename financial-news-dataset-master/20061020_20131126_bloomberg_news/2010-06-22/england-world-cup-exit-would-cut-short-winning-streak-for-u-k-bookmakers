             U.K. and Irish bookmakers’ winning
run at this year’s World Cup is likely to be cut short should
England be eliminated from the tournament today.  
 An early English exit would diminish interest among
customers, according to  William Hill Plc  spokesman  Graham Sharpe , who predicts that wagers on the World Cup will still
exceed his company’s pre-tournament prediction of 1 billion
pounds ($1.48 billion). Defeats or ties for England, as well as
for favorites Spain, Germany, France and Italy, have contributed
to a “brilliant” run of results for betting firms, he said.  
 “So far, it’s like it was scripted for the bookmakers,”
said Sharpe, who’s been helping set World Cup  odds  for William
Hill since 1974. The bookmaker would rather see England remain
in the tournament to maintain interest among bettors, he said.  
 England needs to beat Slovenia in its final group game
today to guarantee qualification for the next round. Defeat
would mean elimination after two draws in the team’s opening
games. The June 18 tie with Algeria was the single-most
profitable England game ever, with William Hill estimating that
the industry won 10 million pounds on the match.  
 Bets on Slovenia  
 Reflecting England’s difficulties,  Paddy Power Plc  had more
bets yesterday on Slovenia winning today’s fixture, an “unheard
of” situation in Britain, home of the “patriotic punter,”
said  Darren Haines , spokesman for Ireland’s biggest bookmaker.  
 “England winning the World Cup,  Andy Murray  winning
Wimbledon, it’s always going with the home-grown,” Haines said.  
 William Hill offers 6-4 odds that England will be booed off
the field against Slovenia, and Ladbrokes Plc offers 2-1 that
the team will be knocked out and coach  Fabio Capello  will quit.  
 Still, bookmakers are doing so well already they likely
would have a windfall even if England goes out today, according
to  David Jennings , an analyst at Davy Securities in Dublin. Any
scenario where Spain, France, Italy or Brazil is eliminated
early would probably be lucrative, he said. Bookmakers usually
benefit from both draws and defeats by favorites.  
 William Hill took one bet of 110,000 pounds on France,
which was eliminated from the tournament after losing to South
Africa yesterday, according to Sharpe.  
 “It’s hard to see them not making a lot of money on this
tournament,” Jennings said.
