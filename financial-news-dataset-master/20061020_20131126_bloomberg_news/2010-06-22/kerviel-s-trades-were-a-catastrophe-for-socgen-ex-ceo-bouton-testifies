             Jerome Kerviel ’s 50 billion euros
($61 billion) in unauthorized trades were a “catastrophe” for
 Societe Generale SA , former chief executive officer  Daniel Bouton  told a Paris court today.  
 France’s second-largest bank by market value lost 4.9
billion euros in the process of liquidating Kerviel’s accounts
over three days in January 2008 as markets fell worldwide.  
 “Fifty billion euros is monstrous,” Bouton said, standing
before the court, two chairs from where Jerome Kerviel sat. “It
was a catastrophe.”  
 Kerviel, 33, is accused of abuse of trust, faking documents
and hacking the bank’s computers to hide positions that exceeded
his mandate with faked hedges. Kerviel has argued his superiors
were aware of and condoned his bets. Bouton resigned as chief
executive officer in April 2008 after a 5.5 billion-euro capital
raising campaign, and stepped down as chairman in 2009.  
 Someone at the center of the bank’s operations “had the
capacity to fabricate, to lie,” Bouton said, recalling the
moment over the weekend of Jan. 19, 2008, when the bank realized
what had happened. When asked about his work, “the trader
continued to lie. He didn’t help us. He left us alone to
discover it the next day.”  
 Bouton is the final witness called in the three-week trial
ending June 25.
