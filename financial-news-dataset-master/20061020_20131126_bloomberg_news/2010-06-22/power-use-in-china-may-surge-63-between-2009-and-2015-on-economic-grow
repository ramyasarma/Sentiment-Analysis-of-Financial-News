             Electricity demand in China, the
world’s second-biggest energy user, may increase 63 percent
between 2009 and 2015 as the economy expands, the State
Electricity Regulatory Commission said today.  
 Consumption may reach 5.86 trillion kilowatt-hours, the
power regulator said in a statement on its website. That
compares with 3.6 trillion kilowatt-hours last year, based on
data from the National Energy Administration published on Jan. 6.  
 China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, is
expected to expand four times faster than the U.S. this year,
the United Nations said in December. Energy demand is expected
to grow “quickly” as the economy maintains a fast pace of
expansion between 2010 and 2020, the regulator said in today’s
statement  
 Energy consumption may rise to the equivalent of 4.2
billion metric tons of coal in 2015 and 5 billion tons in 2020,
according to the statement. The country’s installed power
capacity may reach 1.35 billion kilowatts in 2015, it said.
