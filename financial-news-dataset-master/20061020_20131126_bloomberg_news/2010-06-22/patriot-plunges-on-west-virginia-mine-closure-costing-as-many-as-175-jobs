             Patriot Coal Corp. , the fourth-
largest eastern U.S. coal company, fell 15 percent after it said
it would close the Harris No. 1 mine in West Virginia, a move
that may mean the loss of as many as 175 jobs.  
 Patriot fell $2.43 to $13.77 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had risen 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday.  
 The mine was closed because of “sudden adverse geologic
conditions,” in the primary conveyor belt and mine entryway,
which made mining operations impractical, the St. Louis-based
company said in a statement yesterday.  
 The Harris mine, operated by Eastern Associated Coal LLC, a
unit of Patriot’s, had halted production after a roof fall on
its main line belt on June 12.  
 “The closure is effective immediately, there is no
additional production,”  Mark Schroeder , Patriot Coal’s chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview. “There’s
somewhere between 150 to 175 employees at Harris and we are
still determining how many are affected immediately, and those
who will stay to recover equipment in the mine.”  
 The mine, near Wharton, in Boone County, West Virginia, was
nearing the end of its projected life and was already scheduled
for closure in 2011, Patriot said.  
 “Production was a little over 100,000 tons and that was
the run rate we anticipated on a quarterly basis for the year,”
Schroeder said. The Harris mine was ‘expected to produce 400,000
to 450,000 tons for 2010,” he said.  
 The mine produces metallurgical coal, used to manufacture
steel.
