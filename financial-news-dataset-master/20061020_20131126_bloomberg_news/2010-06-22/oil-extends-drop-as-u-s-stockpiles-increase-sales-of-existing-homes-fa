             Crude oil fell for a second day in
New York amid speculation rising supplies in the U.S. and a
surprise drop in home sales signaled the world’s largest energy
consumer may be struggling to sustain a recovery.  
 Oil extended yesterday’s 1 percent decline after the
National Association of Realtors reported  existing-homes  sales
fell 2.2 percent in May, missing economist estimates. Crude
stockpiles increased 3.69 million barrels last week to a three-
week high, according to the industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute. An Energy Department today may report a drawdown.  
 “Sentiment remains very fragile,” said  David Moore , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in
Sydney. “Confidence has been rattled in recent months by
European fiscal issues and by data in the U.S. that’s been
uneven. They’re factors that have left markets cautious.”  
 Crude for August delivery fell as much as 81 cents, or 1
percent, to $77.04 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $77.44 at 2:20 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract lost 76 cents to settle
at $77.85.  
 The July contract dropped 61 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $77.21 a barrel and expired at the close of floor
trading. Futures are down 2.5 percent this year.  
 The U.S. Commerce Department may report a decline in new-
home sales today after a government tax credit ended. Sales
probably fell 19 percent to a 410,000 annual pace last month,
according to the median estimate of 57 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Oil Supplies  
 U.S.  crude  inventories probably fell 800,000 barrels in the
week ended June 18 from 363.1 million, according to the median
estimate from 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline
stockpiles may have slipped 180,000 barrels and distillates,
including heating oil and diesel, likely rose 1.5 million
barrels.  
 “I don’t think the oil market is tight at present,
inventories remain high,” said Moore at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. Yesterday’s API data showed “crude stocks were up
quite a bit, distillate stocks were up, and gasoline supplies
were up,” he said.  
 Crude supplies at  Cushing , Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York futures, gained 386,000 barrels to 38 million, the
API said. That’s 36,000 barrels below a record reported for the
week to May 14.  
 Gasoline stockpiles had a 810,000-barrel gain to 221.2
million, the highest in five weeks, according to the API.
Distillates increased 1.1 million barrels to 154.7 million, a
four-month high.  
 Brent Oil  
 Brent crude for August delivery dropped as much as 73 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $77.31 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $77.79 at 2:23 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract dropped 78 cents, or 1 percent, to
$78.04, the lowest settlement in five days.  
 Crude extended declines after a New Orleans federal judge
lifted a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling imposed by
President  Barack Obama  following the largest oil spill in U.S.
history.  
 Obama temporarily halted all drilling in waters deeper than
500 feet on May 27 for a presidential commission to study safety
improvements for offshore operations. More than a dozen
Louisiana offshore service and supply companies sued regulators
to lift the ban. The government said it would appeal yesterday’s
decision.
