             Station Casinos Inc. , the biggest
U.S. gambling company in bankruptcy, can proceed with plans to
auction most of its properties, a judge ruled.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Gregg Zive  in Reno, Nevada, denied a
request by lower-ranking station creditors to halt the Aug. 6
auction while they pursue appeals. The creditors are trying to
overturn Zive’s decision to allow a  sale  of part of the company.  
 The committee of unsecured creditors still has the option
of asking a U.S. District Court judge to halt the auction, said
the panel’s lawyer, Brett A. Axelrod of Fox Rothschild LLP.  
 “Stay tuned,” Axelrod said yesterday in an interview.  
 Zive is overseeing Station’s reorganization, which involves
breaking the Las Vegas-based company into two parts, both of
which would be taken over and reassembled by a partnership led
by company Chairman  Frank Fertitta  and his brother, Vice
Chairman  Lorenzo Fertitta . The Fertittas and their partners,
including some company lenders, must first win the Aug. 6
auction for a majority of Station’s 18 casinos.  
 Lori Nelson, a spokeswoman for Station, declined to
comment.  
 The case is In re Station Casinos Inc., 09-52477, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Reno).
