             Saudi Aramco rejected allegations
made by former employee Nicholas Pozzi that there was a
“‘secret’’ oil spill in 1993 in the Persian Gulf.  
 Aramco said in a statement on its website today that
‘‘there is no factual basis’’ to the allegations carried by news
media and Internet blogs.  
 Aramco said it cleaned up spills during a six-month period
in 1991 during the Gulf War.
