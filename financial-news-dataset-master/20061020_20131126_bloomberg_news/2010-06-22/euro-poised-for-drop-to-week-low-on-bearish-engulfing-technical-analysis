             The euro is poised to fall to a one-
week low of $1.2215 in the next two days after a “bearish
engulfing” overwhelmed traders who had been buying the 16-
nation currency, according to Barclays Plc.  
 The 16-nation currency opened higher yesterday and rallied
as much as 0.8 percent to its four-week high of $1.2487 in Tokyo
trading. It went on to slump below its June 18 low during the
New York session to close at $1.2312 on concern the resumption
of more flexible trading in China’s yuan would provide less
support to global growth than analysts had initially predicted.  
 “You have a pretty nice bearish engulfing, which is
indicative of near-term exhaustion,”  MacNeil Curry , a technical
analyst at Barclays in New York, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “I would be inclined to say we’re going to see new
lows, but on a short-term basis, a very short-term basis like
the next session or two, $1.2215 would be an initial point.”  
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2276 at 3:33 p.m. in New
York and traded as much as 0.5 percent lower at $1.2252 on
speculation European banks are having difficulty raising money.
The shared currency extended its decline after a 10 a.m. report
showed sales of  existing homes  unexpectedly fell in May.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The bearish engulfing indicates
further declines in an asset because the slump after the setting
of a high indicates buying demand is insufficient to keep prices
elevated.  
 “It’s not a good-looking pattern,” Barclays’s Curry said.
“Basically what happens is you get a push to new highs, a
reversal and a close below the previous session’s lows. The
price action of the previous day is engulfed, hence bearish
engulfing, and it’s also a key reversal in the sense that you
completely reverse the previous day’s gains.”  
 The level of $1.2215 corresponds to the 21-day moving
average as of yesterday’s close, he said.
