             China should increase international
trade settlements in the yuan and develop it into a key global
investment and reserve currency, Zhang Monan, an economist with
the State Information Center, wrote in an opinion piece in the
China Daily today.  
 The Chinese government should create “channels for the
renminbi’s overseas investment and financing” and slowly expand
the currency’s overseas circulation, Zhang wrote.
