             Mexico’s peso fell for the first
time in four days after a decline in existing U.S. home sales
fueled speculation that the economic recovery may slow.  
 The currency dropped 0.6 percent to 12.6115 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.5351 yesterday. The loss pared the
peso’s gain this year to 3.8 percent against the dollar, the
best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  
 Housing and payroll data in the U.S. have “raised concerns
about the fragility of the economy,” said  Flavia Cattan- Naslausky , a currency strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in
Stamford, Connecticut. “There is some concern we may get some
global revisions of growth.”  
 Purchases of existing houses fell 2.2 percent to a 5.66
million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors said.
The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of the Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.299 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.35 centavo to 124.07 centavos.  
 Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. So far this month,
$521 million of the $600 million in dollar options have been
exercised.  
 The bank has been auctioning the options monthly, allowing
it to purchase dollars to boost foreign reserves after the peso
reached a record low last year.
