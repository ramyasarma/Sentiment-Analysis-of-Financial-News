             ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest
steelmaker, said it plans to buy more iron-ore assets to guard
against raw-material price changes as the industry moves to
shorter-term contracts.  
 The switch to quarterly iron-ore pricing from annual
accords will prompt ArcelorMittal to increase “vertical
integration,” Chief Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal  said today
at the Steel Success Strategies conference in New York.  
 Mittal said he isn’t in favor of quarterly pricing, which
could be “dangerous.” Chinese steel demand, which rose 25
percent last year, created an imbalance in iron-ore markets, he
said. Chinese demand may rise 10 percent this year, higher than
his earlier forecast of 5 percent, Mittal said.
