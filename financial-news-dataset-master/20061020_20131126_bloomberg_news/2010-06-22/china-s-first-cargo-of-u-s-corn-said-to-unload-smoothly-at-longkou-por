             China, the world’s second-largest corn
consumer, is unloading its first cargo of the U.S. grain this year
at Longkou port in Shandong province, two people with direct knowledge
of the matter said.  
 The 60,000 metric-ton shipment, sold by Louis Dreyfus & Cie SA
to Liuhe Group Co., may take several days to discharge because of
delays caused by rain, said the people, who declined to be identified
as the information isn’t public. Authorities are testing samples
during the unloading, they said.  
 China, the third-biggest economy, has booked the most corn  imports 
in 14 years, and is draining domestic stockpiles to cool an 18 percent
gain in local prices in the past year. The nation bought six cargoes
from the U.S. in the past two weeks, or 360,000 tons, bringing
purchases to 16 cargoes, or almost 1 million tons, according to two
executives familiar with the transactions.  
 Outstanding sales of U.S. corn to China were 655,100 tons as of
June 10 and accumulated exports were 60,000 tons, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data. Exporters sold 120,000 tons to the
Asian nation, the USDA said June 14.
