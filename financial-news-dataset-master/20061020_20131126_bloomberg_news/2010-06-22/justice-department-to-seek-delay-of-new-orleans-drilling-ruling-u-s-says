             The U.S. Justice Department will
seek to delay implementation of a New Orleans judge’s order
lifting the ban on deepwater offshore drilling, a government
lawyer said today in a separate drilling ban case in Houston
federal court. The U.S. is preparing an appeal in the New
Orleans case, said government attorney Michael Thorp.
