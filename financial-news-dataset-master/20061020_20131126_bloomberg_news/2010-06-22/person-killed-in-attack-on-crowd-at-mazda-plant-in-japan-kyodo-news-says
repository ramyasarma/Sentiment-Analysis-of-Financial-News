             One person was killed when a former
worker drove a car into a crowd at a  Mazda Motor Corp.  factory
in Hiroshima, western Japan, the company said.  
 Ten other people were injured in the attack at 7:35 a.m.
today, said  Sho Aoyama , a Tokyo-based spokesman for  the  carmaker.
The driver was a 42-year-old former temporary worker who was
hired on March 25 and resigned “for personal reasons” on April
14, Aoyama said.  
 The attacker fled the scene by car and was arrested about
an hour later, the Associated Press said, citing police. Because
of the attack, the factory opened about an hour later than usual
this morning, Aoyama said.  
 Mazda said in April it planned to hire about 100 temporary
factory workers by this month, adding to about 240 recruited
between January and April as a recovery in global car demand
boosted the Hiroshima-based company’s exports.  
 Mazda was  unchanged  at 236 yen as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo
trading.
