             South Africa’s economy shed 79,000
jobs in the first quarter, threatening to worsen the highest
 unemployment rate  of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg and
raising doubts about the strength of the recovery.  
 Employment in the formal, non-agricultural economy fell 1
percent to 8.08 million in the three months through March, after
gaining a revised 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, Pretoria-
based Statistics South Africa said on its website today.  
 South Africa lost 870,000 jobs last year as Africa’s
biggest economy fell into its first  recession  in 17 years,
pushing up the unemployment rate to 25.2 percent. Employment has
been slow to revive during the economic recovery, undermining a
government pledge to cut the jobless rate to 14 percent by 2014.  
 “These are horrible numbers, given that the economy is
already growing,” said  Johan Botha , an economist at
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s biggest
lender. “The economy’s ability to grow jobs has been declining
over time. It looks like we’re heading into a soft patch on the
growth side.”  
 The economy expanded an annualized 4.6 percent in the first
quarter, buoyed by a rebound in  manufacturing  and mining
exports. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
demand, has remained weak even after the central bank cut its
benchmark interest  rate  seven times to 6.5 percent since
December 2008.  
 Rate Cut  
 “We continue to believe there is room for another interest
rate cut in the current cycle given the fundamental weakness in
the economy,”  Annabel Bishop , an economist at Investec in
Johannesburg, said in a note to clients today.  
 The Reserve Bank will make its next interest rate decision
on July 22.  
 Employment fell in the first quarter as construction
projects related to the soccer World Cup ended.  
 The construction industry lost 7,000 jobs in the first
quarter from the previous three months and 50,000, or 10.9
percent, compared with the same period last year, the statistics
office said.  
 South Africa has spent 43 billion rand ($5.7 billion) to
expand roads and airports, build railways and renovate stadiums
for the monthlong soccer tournament, which began on June 11.  
 The statistics office publishes the unemployment rate in a
separate survey, which includes jobs in informal industries.
