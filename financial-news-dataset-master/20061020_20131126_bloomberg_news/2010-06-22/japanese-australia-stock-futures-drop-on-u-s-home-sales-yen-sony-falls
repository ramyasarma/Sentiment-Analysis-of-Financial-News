             Japanese and Australian  stock 
futures fell on concern U.S. economic growth is stalling after
home sales in the country unexpectedly dropped.  
 American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. , a carmaker
that gets 81 percent of its sales outside Japan, closed 1.7
percent lower than the Tokyo close yesterday as the dollar and
euro weakened against the yen. Receipts of  Sony Corp. , the maker
of the PlayStation 3 game machine, declined 1.6 percent. ADRs of
Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining
company, sank 1.5 percent after prices for oil and copper sank.  
 “The outlook for the global economy is rapidly getting
hazier,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are becoming more
inclined to avoid risk.”  
 Yen-denominated futures  on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in September closed at 9,940 in Chicago yesterday, 1.7
percent lower than 10,110 in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-
market at 9,950 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 10,112.89 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1 percent.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.2 percent.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 0.8 percent yesterday,
breaking an eight-day winning streak, after Fitch Ratings cut
its credit rating on BNP Paribas SA, France’s largest bank. The
gauge has risen 8.6 percent from this year’s low on May 25, as
reports on U.S. car and home sales boosted the earnings outlook
for Asian manufacturers and China signaled an end to the yuan’s
fixed rate against the dollar.

 The increase has driven the average price of shares in the
gauge to 14.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.8 times
on May 18, the lowest level in almost 17 months.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent.
The index dropped 1.6 percent in New York yesterday, the most
since June 4, after the National Association of Realtors said
purchases of existing houses fell 2.2 percent in May month-on-
month, compared with the 6 percent gain estimated by economists.  
 The dollar weakened to as low as 90.47 yen today from 90.81
at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo. The euro
depreciated to 110.95 from 111.61. A stronger yen reduces the
value of overseas sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  
 Crude oil for July delivery slid 0.3 percent today, adding
to a 1 percent drop yesterday. Copper futures for September
delivery lost 0.9 percent, the first slump this week.  
 Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has held talks with
Brazil’s bourse over potential listings, according to Hong Kong
Exchanges’ Chairman Ronald Arculli. The discussions have
revolved around the listing of Brazilian companies in Hong Kong
as well as Hong Kong companies in the South American country,
Arculli said yesterday.  
 Japan’s government is scheduled to release its report on
the nation’s exports at 8:50 a.m. today. Shipments probably grew
36.5 percent in May year-on-year, according to economists’
estimates.
