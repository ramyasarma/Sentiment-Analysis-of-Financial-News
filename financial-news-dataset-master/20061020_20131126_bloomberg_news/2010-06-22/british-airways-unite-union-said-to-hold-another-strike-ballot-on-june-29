             British Airways Plc ’s cabin crew
union will today notify the company that it intends to ballot
members on further strike action, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  
 The Unite union, which represents British Airways’ 12,000
flight attendants, plans to inform the carrier today of its
intention to start a strike vote June 29, said the person, who
asked not to be identified as the decision hasn’t been made
public.  
 British Airways and Unite have been unable to resolve a 16-
month dispute about staffing levels and the future wage bill of
the company. A series of strikes that began March 20 and ended
June 9 have grounded flights on 22 days in total.  
 Unite spokeswoman  Pauline Doyle  declined to comment.  
 Financial Times reported the timing of the planned strike 
vote today.
