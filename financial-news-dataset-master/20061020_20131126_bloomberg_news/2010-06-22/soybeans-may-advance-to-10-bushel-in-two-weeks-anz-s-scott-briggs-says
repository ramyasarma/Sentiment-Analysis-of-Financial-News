             Soybean futures may rally to $10 a
bushel within the next two weeks on “short-term tightness” and
speculative covering,  Scott Briggs , agricultural commodities
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said.  
 The November-delivery contract was unchanged at $9.39 a
bushel at 11:07 a.m. in Singapore after rallying in the past
four days. Soybean futures have fallen 10 percent in 2010.  
 “While the recent rallies in both corn and wheat seem
ready to run into upside resistance, in beans the story is
different,” he said. “There is short-term upside.”  
 Corn, wheat and soybeans are the top three crops in the U.S.  
 Chicago wheat fell a third day, with the September contract
trading at $4.7475 a bushel, after rallying 12 percent from June
9 to June 17.  
 Investors should buy November EU mill wheat and sell
December Chicago wheat futures as a hedge, “to provide
significant upside with limited risk,” Briggs said.  
 EU mill wheat traded at 153.50 euros ($189) a ton, or $4.18
a bushel, on Euronext yesterday, while Chicago wheat for
December delivery traded at $5.0475 a bushel at 10:50 a.m.
Singapore time.
