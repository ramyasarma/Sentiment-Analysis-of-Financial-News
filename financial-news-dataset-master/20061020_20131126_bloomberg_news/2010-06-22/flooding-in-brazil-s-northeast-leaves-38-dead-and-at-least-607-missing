             Floods in Brazil’s northeast have
killed 38 people and displaced about 68,000 inhabitants as more
rain is forecast in the region. At least 607 people are reported
missing.  
 Above-average rainfall has caused flooding in 69 cities in
 Alagoas  and  Pernambuco  states since June 17, according to
information on the state governments’ websites.  
 The federal government will release 100 million reais
($56.6 million) in emergency aid, Planning Minister  Paulo Bernardo  told reporters in Brasilia today. He said the
government may raise emergency funds if necessary.  
 The government’s  Meteorology Institute  is forecasting more
showers in the region throughout this week, Inmet, as the
institute is known, said on its website.
