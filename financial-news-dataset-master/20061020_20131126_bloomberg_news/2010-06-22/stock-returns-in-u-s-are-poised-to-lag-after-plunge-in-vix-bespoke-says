             The VIX dropping by almost half in
the past month is a bearish sign for  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
returns, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  
 The VIX, as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index  is known, has  tumbled  41 percent since May 20. In the
dozen times since 1986 that it slumped 35 percent or more in 20
trading days, the S&P 500 lost 0.72 percent and 1.35 percent on
average during the next week and month, respectively, and rose
0.84 percent and 3.78 percent in three and six months, Bespoke
said. All four returns trailed the average performance for all
days, according to the firm.  
 The last time the VIX fell this fast was after the crash
known as Black Monday in October 1987, according to a report
sent to clients yesterday from Harrison, New York-based Bespoke,
founded by  Paul Hickey  and  Justin Walters . Since 1986, gains for
the S&P 500 during all one-week, one-month, three-month and six-
month periods have averaged 0.16 percent, 0.61 percent, 1.89
percent and 4.01 percent, respectively, Bespoke said.  
 The VIX, which measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the S&P 500, surged to 45.79 on
May 20 amid concern that some European nations will struggle to
repay their debts. It rose to 27.05 today after sinking to 22.87
yesterday, the weakest intraday level since May 4. The gauge has
averaged 20.35 during its  20 years of history .  
 ‘Old VIX’  
 Because VIX data don’t go back past 1990, Bespoke used its
precursor, the CBOE S&P 100 Volatility Index, for the data
points in the 1980s. The “old VIX,” which reflects prices paid
for S&P 100 options, closed at a record 150.19 on Oct. 19, 1987,
following the stock market crash known as Black Monday.  
 Birinyi Associates Inc., where Hickey and Walters worked as
analysts before leaving to found Bespoke in 2007, said in March
that investors looking for clues about the U.S. stock market
should probably ignore the VIX.  
 Speculation that equity returns will be positive after the
volatility gauge decreases and negative when it climbs has
little basis in fact, according to  Laszlo Birinyi ’s Westport,
Connecticut-based firm. The VIX provides a summary of  historical
price swings  and tends to move in lockstep with equities instead
of forecasting their direction, Birinyi Associates said.
