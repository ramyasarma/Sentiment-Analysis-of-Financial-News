             The fastest profit growth since 2004
will push  European stocks  up 15 percent by January, handing
investors the biggest two-year advance in a decade, according to
estimates from 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The euro’s 14 percent retreat against the dollar will boost
earnings at least 25 percent this year, according to UBS AG’s
 Nick Nelson  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  Peter Oppenheimer  in
London. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  has dropped 5.6 percent from
its April high, trimming its 2010 gain to 1.2 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Strategists recommend buying shares because the global
economic rebound will overcome concerns that governments will
default in Europe. Two consecutive months of declines pushed the
Stoxx 600’s price to  14.4 times  annual income on May 25, the
lowest ratio since 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 “Share prices have discounted much of the impact of the
debt problem,” said Nelson, who projects a 19 percent gain in
the  FTSEurofirst 300 Index  by year end. “There will be fiscal
austerity packages and yes that’s a drag on growth, but not
enough to derail the recovery.”  
 Earnings Forecasts  
 Earnings for Stoxx 600 companies are  forecast  to rise 70
percent this year, the most since the 82 percent jump in 2004,
according to more than 11,000 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs’s chief European
strategist, estimates a 38 percent increase in the region’s
profits, while UBS’s Nelson predicts a 25 percent gain.  
 The 15 percent increase in equities forecast by strategists
would send the Stoxx 600 to 295 by year end, a 49 percent gain
from the close of 2008. The  benchmark  gauge for European
equities slipped 0.6 percent to 255.28 at 8:51 a.m. in London.  
 Gary Baker , strategist for Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit in London, estimates earnings-per-share will increase
5 to 8 percent for every 10 percent loss in the euro against a
basket of currencies. The single European currency is heading
for the biggest annual drop since 1999 amid concern budget gaps
in Greece, Spain and Portugal will spur sovereign defaults.  
 New York-based  Morgan Stanley , which began 2010 as the only
firm to forecast a retreat by year-end, now sees a 16 percent
surge in stocks over the next 12 months.  
 ‘Growth Driver’  
 “Exports, facilitated by a weak euro, can be a growth
driver,” said  Guillaume Duchesne , a Luxembourg-based equity
strategist at BGL BNP Paribas, which oversees about $117
billion. “That is one of the strongest drivers for the stock
market. Stocks will remain volatile, but will move higher by
year end.” Duchesne declined to give a forecast.  
 The euro’s depreciation is boosting the value of Paris-
based  Pernod Ricard SA ’s sales in the U.S. and China, Finance
Director  Gilles Bogaert  said in a May 20 interview. The maker of
Absolut vodka estimated earnings before interest and taxes will
increase by 12 million euros ($14.8 million) for every 1 percent
slide in the euro against the dollar. Shares of the French
company have climbed 14 percent this year.  
 STMicroelectronics NV, Europe’s biggest chipmaker, will
generate $8 million to $10 million of additional  operating
profit  per quarter for every 1 percent drop in the euro, Chief
Financial Officer  Carlo Ferro  said in a briefing in Hong Kong on
June 18. The Geneva-based company’s shares have advanced 12
percent in 2010.  
 Underestimated Rally  
 Brokerages underestimated the rally in European stocks last
year. Goldman Sachs’s Oppenheimer said in January 2009 that
indexes would climb 20 percent by the end of the year if credit
markets recovered and the pace of economic deterioration slowed.
Baker’s team at Merrill, which was renamed after the takeover by
Bank of America, estimated a 9.1 percent advance for 2009. The
 Stoxx 600  surged 28 percent, the biggest annual gain since 1999.  
 Demand from investors buying Spanish, Portuguese and
Italian government bonds in June may show the worst of the
sovereign-debt crisis is over, according to  Edmund Shing  at
Barclays Capital in London. Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of
bonds on June 17, the maximum set for the auction as investors
bid for 1.9 times the amount on offer. Shing forecasts the  Euro
Stoxx 50 Index  will reach 3,100 by the end of this year, 13
percent higher than yesterday’s close.  
 Spending cuts in the most indebted countries may hurt
growth. Greece has raised taxes and trimmed wages to tackle its
deficit, which swelled to 13.6 percent of gross domestic product
last year. The government forecasts that the austerity measures
will deepen the country’s recession, leading the economy to
contract 4 percent this year, about twice the 2009 pace. Spain
is seeking to trim the euro region’s third-largest deficit to 6
percent of GDP by 2011.  
 ‘Anxiety About Europe’  
 “The anxiety about Europe is justified in the short
term,” said  James Bristow , a fund manager of global equities
funds in London for BlackRock Inc., which oversees $3.4 trillion
worldwide. “Our estimates will have to be adjusted as we go
through this tightening.”  
 Seven of the analysts surveyed forecast at least a 15
percent gain for European equities by the end of the year.
 Mislav Matejka , head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in London expects stocks to climb 18 percent, while
Merrill’s Baker predicts a 17 percent gain.  
 “Earnings will surprise on the upside,” Matejka wrote in
a report to clients this week. “The recovery will prove
sustainable.”
