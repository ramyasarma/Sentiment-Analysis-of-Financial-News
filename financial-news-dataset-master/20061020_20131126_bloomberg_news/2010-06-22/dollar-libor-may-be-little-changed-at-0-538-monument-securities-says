             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in dollars may be little changed today,
according to Monument Securities Ltd.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may be 0.538 percent, said Marc Ostwald, a fixed-income
strategist in London. The rate was 0.538 percent yesterday, data
from the British Bankers’ Association showed.
