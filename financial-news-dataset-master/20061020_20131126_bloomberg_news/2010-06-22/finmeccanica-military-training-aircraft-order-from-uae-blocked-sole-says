             A Finmeccanica SpA military aircraft
order from the United Arab Emirates, worth over 1 billion euros
($1.23 billion), has been “blocked,” Il Sole 24 Ore reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 A contract for the sale of 48 Aermacchi M-346 trainers,
expected to have been signed by the end of 2009, hasn’t been
concluded, the Italian newspaper reported, without providing
further details.  
 Finmeccanica is still in contact with the UAE, according to
the Italian newspaper.
