             Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s
biggest cosmetics maker, headed to its fourth consecutive record
close after Raymond James & Associates Inc. cited the company’s
“strong momentum” as it expands in Brazil and abroad.  
 Natura’s earnings will benefit from launches of products
specific to different regions of Brazil as well as other Latin
American markets such as Mexico and Colombia, Raymond James
analyst  Daniela Bretthauer  wrote in a note to clients today.  
 “Natura should report strong second-quarter results,”
Bretthauer wrote.  
 Natura gained 2.9 percent to 42.07 reais at 10:42 a.m. New
York time in Sao Paulo trading. Shares have surged 12 percent in
the past week, compared to an increase of 0.9 percent for the
benchmark Bovespa index.  
 “Recent outperformance relative to our coverage universe
and the index is reducing the upside potential and making
valuation a bit rich,” Bretthauer wrote. Raymond James has an
“outperform” rating on the stock.
