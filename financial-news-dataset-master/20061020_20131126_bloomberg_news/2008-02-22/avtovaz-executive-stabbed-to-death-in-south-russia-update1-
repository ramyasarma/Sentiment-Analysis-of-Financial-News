             OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) ,  Russia 's biggest
carmaker, said its chief parts purchaser, Vyacheslav Shirshov,
was murdered yesterday.  
 Shirshov, 37, was found at about 9 p.m. in the entryway of
his apartment building in Togliatti, the southern Russian city
where AvotVAZ is based, said Irina Doroshenko, a spokeswoman for
the regional branch of the Prosecutor's General's Office. He was
stabbed in the stomach, she said, declining to elaborate.  
 Togliatti, a city of about 700,000 people on the  Volga
River , was known as Russia's crime capital in the early part of
the decade, when contract killings occurred almost weekly, many
of them related to the  auto industry .  Renault SA (RNO) , France's
second-largest automaker, agreed in December to buy 25 percent of
AvtoVAZ for an estimated $1.3 billion.  
 ``A criminal case has been started and various versions are
being looked into,'' AvtoVAZ said in an e-mailed statement. ``The
management of AvtoVAZ on behalf of all staff is sincerely
extending condolences to the relatives and friends of Vyacheslav
Alexandrovich Shirshov.''  
 Shirshov is survived by a wife and two children. He had
worked for AvtoVAZ since 1993.  
 AvtoVAZ employs 104,000 people in Togliatti.
