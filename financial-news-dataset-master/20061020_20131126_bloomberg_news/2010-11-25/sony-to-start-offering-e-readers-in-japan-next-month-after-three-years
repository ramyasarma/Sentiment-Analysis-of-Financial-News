Sony Corp.  will resume sales of
electronic-book readers in Japan for the first time since 2007,
aiming to win a 50 percent share of the local market for digital
publications.  The Reader Pocket Edition, with a 5-inch display, will be
available in stores for about 20,000 yen ($240) starting Dec. 10,
Tokyo-based Sony said today in a statement. A bigger touch-
screen edition will be offered for about 25,000 yen, it said.  In July, Sony cut the price of its e-readers in the U.S.
for the second time since the introduction of Apple Inc.’s iPad
in April intensified competition. Osaka-based  Sharp Corp. ,
Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, will start
offering a Japanese-language electronic bookstore service next
month, it said in September.  Sony aims to sell 300,000 readers in Japan in the first
year,  Nobuki Kurita , president of the company’s marketing unit
for Japan, told reporters in Tokyo. Japan’s e-book market may
grow to more than 1 million shipments by 2012, Kurita said.  Sony, which stopped selling e-readers in Japan three years
ago because of low demand, formed a venture earlier this year
with mobile-phone operator KDDI Corp., Asahi Shimbun Publishing
Corp. and Toppan Printing Co. to provide electronic publications.  The electronics maker said in May it plans to begin sales
of e-readers in China, Italy, Spain and Australia this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
