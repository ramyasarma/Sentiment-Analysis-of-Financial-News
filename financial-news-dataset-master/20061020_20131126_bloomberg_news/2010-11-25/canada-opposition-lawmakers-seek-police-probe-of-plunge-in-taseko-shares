Canadian Liberal Party Lawmaker Mark
Holland today called on the federal government to ask the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to investigate a sudden drop in  Taseko
Mines Ltd . shares on Oct. 14.  “Someone, somewhere in the Conservative government leaked,
insiders got wildly rich and investors got hammered,” Holland
said in the House of Commons in Ottawa. “Why after six weeks
have the RCMP not been called?”  Taseko’s shares fell as much as 34 percent on Oct. 14, the
largest intraday drop since 1990, and the company’s management
said it wasn’t aware of any reason for the decline.  Taseko was seeking federal approval to develop its
Prosperity deposit, 125 kilometers (78 miles) southwest of
Williams Lake. Former Environment Minister  Jim Prentice  said on
Nov. 2 he wouldn’t allow the project to go ahead.  John Baird , the Conservatives’ parliamentary leader and
current environment minister, said a negative environmental
assessment of the project had been available for months. He also
said there had been “significant speculation” that the
government would approve the project.  The British Columbia Securities Commission said today it is
reviewing a referral made to it by the Investment Industry
Regulatory Organization of Canada regarding the trading in
Taseko shares. The commission also said that it doesn’t comment
on matters under review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
