Poland needs to narrow its budget
deficit and stem growth in its public debt over the next several
years to “prevent negative pressure building on its sovereign
creditworthiness,” Fitch Ratings said in a e-mailed statement
today.  Widening of Poland’s general government deficit to 7.9
percent of gross domestic product this year has “weakened the
credibility of Poland’s fiscal forecasts,” the ratings company
said.  “Tolerance for further material slippage from official
deficit targets is limited at the current rating level,” David
Heslam, a London-based director at Fitch’s Sovereigns team, said
in the statement. Fitch now has Poland rated at A-, the seventh-
highest investment grade, for long-term foreign currency debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
