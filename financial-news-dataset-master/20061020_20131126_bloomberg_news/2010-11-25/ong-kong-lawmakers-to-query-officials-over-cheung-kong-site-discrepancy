Hong Kong lawmakers will question
government officials next month over a discrepancy in the size
of a project awarded to  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd.  in a tender.  Cheung Kong, the developer controlled by Hong Kong’s
richest man,  Li Ka-shing , won a HK$352.8 million ($45.5 million)
bid in 2003 to convert a former Marine Police headquarters in
the Tsim Sha Tsui district into a hotel.  The developer later conducted its own survey and came up
with a gross floor area of 5,610 square meters for the site,
compared with the 4,300 square meters estimated in a surveying
report before the tender, according to a government statement.  “We feel the government might have been too lenient in
allowing the extra space,” James To, a legislator from the
Democratic Party, said in a phone interview. To said his party
would use the Dec. 8 Legislative Council session to demand an
explanation for the discrepancy.  Cheung Kong paid HK$94.5 million in March 2009 for 200
square meters of additional space. The developer opened the 1881
Heritage hotel and shopping center on that site last year.  Hong Kong’s Audit Commission has “opened a file on the
case and will keep monitoring the situation,” Edmond Chan, a
senior auditor at the semi-independent body, said in an
interview today.  Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post first reported the
discrepancy on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
