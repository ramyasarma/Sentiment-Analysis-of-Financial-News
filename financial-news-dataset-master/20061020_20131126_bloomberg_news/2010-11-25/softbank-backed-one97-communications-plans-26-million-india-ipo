One97 Communications Ltd. , an Indian
software services provider backed by Softbank Corp. and Intel
Corp., will sell shares in an initial public offering from Dec.
1, the company said in a statement in Mumbai today.  The Indian software developer for mobile-phone companies
plans to raise 1.2 billion rupees ($26 million) to procure
equipment and software to expand its business, Managing Director
