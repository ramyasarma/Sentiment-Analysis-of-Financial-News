Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at 111 in the Central business district as of 6
a.m. today, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website.  Pollution at the Central roadside monitoring station has
topped 100 for five straight days. “Very high” roadside
pollution triggers a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic
areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
