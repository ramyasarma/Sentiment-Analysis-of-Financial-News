Beach Energy Ltd. and  Itochu Corp. ,
a Japanese trading company, are considering locations in South
Australia for a proposed A$1 billion ($980 million) liquefied
natural gas plant as part of a preliminary agreement.  The facility, to be fed by Beach’s gas reserves, may
produce 1 million metric tons of LNG a year, the Australian
company said in a statement today. The companies plan to export
the fuel to Asian markets, including Japan, Beach said.  The Sydney-listed company with interests in New Zealand and
Papua New Guinea is among domestic explorers seeking to meet
rising regional demand for the cleaner-burning fuel, and is
following gas producers in the U.S. in exploiting deposits
trapped in shale rock. Beach will pursue shale gas development
in central Australia’s Cooper Basin to expand reserves.  “An opportunity such as this will further accelerate the
next phase of the Cooper Basin as one of Australia’s major
sources of long-term gas supply,” Managing Director  Reg Nelson 
said in the statement.  The LNG project the companies propose under a memorandum of
understanding would need about 60 petajoules of gas a year. The
companies said in July they would study an LNG development.  Beach  rose 2.3 percent to 67 Australian cents in Sydney
trading at 11:39 a.m. local time, compared with a gain of 0.4
percent for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index. Itochu was
unchanged at 783 yen in Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
