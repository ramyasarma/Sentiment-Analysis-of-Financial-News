Western Potash Corp. , a Canadian
explorer of the fertilizer, said it’s in preliminary talks with
potential investors in the company and its Milestone potash
project.  Western Potash has retained advisers to help advance “a
variety of strategic alternatives designed to fast track the
development” in southern Saskatchewan, the Vancouver-based
company said today in a statement.  “Management is also currently in discussions with third
parties who have expressed significant interest in participating
in the company and the project,” Western Potash said in the
statement.  K+S AG , Europe’s largest potash producer, said Nov. 22 it
agreed to buy Vancouver-based Potash One Inc. for C$434 million
($430 million) to expand its reserves of the crop nutrient.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , based in Melbourne, this month withdrew its $40
billion bid for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , the world’s
largest fertilizer company, after the Canadian government
blocked the takeover.  Western Potash’s Milestone project is located about 30
kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Regina, Saskatchewan’s
capital.  The company said it hired Lockwood Financial of Montreal to
help evaluate financing alternatives.  Patricio Varas , Western Potash’s chief executive officer,
wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Western rose 2 cents to C$1.21 at 3:59 p.m. on the TSX
Venture Exchange in Toronto.  The shares  have more than doubled
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
