Ethiopia has evidence that Egypt
recently aided rebel movements in the country, said the State
Minister for Communications, Shimeles Kemal.  The allegation of Egyptian support for outlawed Ethiopian
groups was first made by Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi  in an
interview with Reuters on Nov. 23. Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  has denied the claims.  “We have solid evidence that Egypt is giving covert
assistance to rebel groups,” Shimeles said in a phone interview
today. “We will disclose the timing and identify the groups at
the right time.”  Ethiopia faces insurgencies in the eastern Ogaden region
from the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and from the Oromo
Liberation Front in Oromia, the largest of its nine federal
states. Last month, the government signed a peace deal with a
faction of the ONLF, though another faction has since claimed
attacks. The OLF said yesterday it had killed 90 soldiers in the
past five weeks. Shimeles said the claim was an “outright
lie.”  Ethiopia and Egypt are locked in a dispute over water usage
from the Nile river. Agreements from the colonial era give Egypt
the right to use two-thirds of the water from the river.  To contact the reporter on this story:
