“Things go where the money is,”
said  Colin Sheaf , U.K. and Asia chief for London-based  auction
house  Bonhams, which sold HK$164.2 million ($21 million) of
liquor, art, antiques and jewels at a two-day auction in Hong
Kong.  The top lot was a famille-rose enameled gold-ground glass
snuff bottle commissioned by the Qianlong emperor (1736-95),
which fetched a record HK$9.1 million, almost four times its
estimate. Chinese modern master  Wu Guanzhong ’s “Dwelling in the
Mountain” sold for HK$3.1 million, also beating its HK$2
million estimate. Most lots sold to mainland Chinese buyers,
Bonhams said.  Bonhams held the sale at the Island Shangri-La Hotel,
including wine, whisky, watches and pens, to tap what Sheaf
described as China’s “new pool of prosperity.” It follows a
weeklong auction by Sotheby’s last month in the city that
tallied HK$3.09 billion. Christie’s International will offer
2,800 lots over seven days in Hong Kong starting tomorrow.  In the equivalent sale a year ago, Bonhams raised about
HK$110 million, the company said.  Bonhams’ wine sale included 4,200 bottles of 2000 and 2003
Bordeaux from an American collection. Cases of Chateau Lafite
Rothschild 2003 sold for HK$154,000 and a 1999 assorted case
from Domaine de la Romanee-Conti fetched HK$261,800.  “Mainland Chinese are developing a taste for wine
remarkably fast,” Sheaf said in an interview in Hong Kong
before the sales. “There are very knowledgeable buyers in Hong
Kong and mainland China.”  Whisky Sale  Chinese buying persuaded the 217-year-old auction house to
hold a second sale of fine and rare whiskies in Hong Kong with
after last year’s sell-out.  Bonhams, the only auction house that conducts whisky
auctions in Europe, Asia and the U.S., sold HK$567,000 of old
and rare single malts on Nov. 23, compared with a presale
estimate of HK$700,000. Four hundred bottles from more than 60
Scottish distilleries were offered, with 80 percent finding
buyers.  Two pairs of single-cask bottles of  Ardbeg , distilled in
1974 and presented in leather gun cases, sold for HK$124,950.
With only 250 sets produced, each was estimated to fetch as much
as HK$120,000.  Wine Capital  Wine sales at Hong Kong’s auctions have more than
quadrupled since the city cut  duties  to zero two years ago.
Sales in the city by rivals  Sotheby’s  and  Christie’s
International  will raise more than in New York and London
combined this year, the two biggest auction houses said.  Three bottles of Chateau Lafite’s 1869 vintage sold for
HK$1.8 million each at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong on Oct. 29, an
auction record for a standard-sized bottle.  Among the antiques, a set of cloisonné enameled Eight
Buddhist Emblems from the Qianlong era sold for HK$6.8 million,
more than five times the HK$1.2 million presale estimate.  Bonhams also sold every lot in its sale of Chinese snuff
bottles from the Mary and George Bloch Collection, tallying
HK$54.8 million for the 155 bottles, or more than twice the
presale estimate.  “China’s increasing liquidity has spilled out to the art
market,” Sheaf said in the interview in Hong Kong on Nov. 22.
“The revaluation of the yuan is giving mainland buyers
increasing purchasing power.”  Sheaf said Bonhams plans to open its first representative
offices in China next year, likely in Beijing followed by
Shanghai.  Christie’s  estimates its Nov. 26-Dec. 2 Hong Kong sale will
total more than HK$1.7 billion, with top lots including a case
of 1978 Romanee-Conti, paintings by Chinese masters Fu Baoshi,
Sanyu and  Cai Guo-Qiang , and antiques from the Shorenstein
collection.  To contact the reporter for this story:
