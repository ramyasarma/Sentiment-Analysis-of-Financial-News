Regal Petroleum Plc , the U.K.
explorer that put all its drilling operations on hold pending a
strategic review, jumped the most since 2006 after receiving a
number of takeover approaches.  “The discussions are at a preliminary stage and hence
there can be no certainty that any offer for the company will be
forthcoming,” London-based Regal said today in a statement.  Regal slumped to a record in September after Chief
Executive Officer David Greer quit and as gas wells in Ukraine
failed to stabilize output. The producer plugged a well in
Ukraine last month after being unable to pull drilling equipment
out of the hole.  The shares  surged  as much as 52 percent, the steepest
intra-day gain since 2006, and traded at 18.25 pence as of 9:48
a.m. in London. That pared their decline for the year to 77
percent.  Regal said in June it was in talks with Ukraine after
receiving an order to suspend operations because of its
compliance with legislation. A court injunction overturned the
order the following month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
