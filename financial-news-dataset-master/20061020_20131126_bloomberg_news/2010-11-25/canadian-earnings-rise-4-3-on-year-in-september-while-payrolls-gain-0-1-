Average  weekly earnings  of non-farm
payroll employees rose 4.3 percent in September from a year
earlier, as the number of people on the job and hours worked
both increased.  Payrolls rose by 1.4 percent from a year earlier to 14.73
million in September, and a 0.9 percent increase in the workweek
to 32.9 hours also helped prompt wage gains, Statistics Canada
said today from Ottawa.  The increase also reflects “changes in the composition of
employment by industry, changes in occupations within industry,
job experience, as well as wage growth,” the report said.  Earnings have posted annual gains greater than 3 percent
for six straight months, exceeding the Bank of Canada’s 1
percent to 3 percent target range for inflation. Today’s report
is second this week to suggest rising prices -- the agency said
two days ago that  consumer prices  advanced 2.4 percent in
October from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years.  On a monthly basis, payrolls increased 0.1 percent while
earnings gained 0.4 percent to C$864.13 ($855.91), the report
said. Hours worked declined 0.3 percent in September from
August.  Statistics Canada’s main  employment report , the labor force
survey of households, said that 6,600 jobs were lost in
September and a net 3,000 new jobs were created in October. The
agency will report 15,000 jobs created during November in its
Dec. 3 report, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The Bank of Canada  said Oct. 20  that unemployment “remains
elevated” even with the country recovering all the jobs lost in
a recession, while Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has curbed
increases in payroll taxes to foster the recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
