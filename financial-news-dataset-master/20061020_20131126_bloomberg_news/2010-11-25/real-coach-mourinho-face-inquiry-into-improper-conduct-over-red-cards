Real Madrid faces a disciplinary
inquiry amid reports coach  Jose Mourinho  instructed players
 Sergio Ramos  and  Xabi Alonso  to be red-carded in a Champions
League game at Ajax two days ago.  European soccer ruling body UEFA said on its  website  it
will deal with the case on Nov. 30.  Ramos, a defender, and midfielder Alonso were ejected for
time wasting in the closing minutes of Real’s 4-0 win at the
Amsterdam Arena.  They are scheduled to serve a suspension in Real’s last
group game against Auxerre on Dec. 8, which the Spanish team can
afford to lose, before becoming available for the first knockout
round.  UEFA said it was investigating Mourinho, Ramos and Alonso
as well as goalkeeper  Iker Casillas  and substitute  Jerzy Dudek .  Television Espanola showed pictures of Mourinho speaking to
Dudek on the substitutes’ bench before the Pole relayed a
message to Casillas during a break in play. Casillas then spoke
to other Real Madrid players.  Mourinho denied any wrongdoing in a televised news
conference after the game, telling reporters they were looking
for a story that didn’t exist. He added that he spoke to many
players during the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
