Asian refiners’ profits from making
naphtha, gasoil and fuel oil fell after crude oil costs rose.
China is on track to meet its year-end energy conservation goal,
the China Daily reported, citing the vice chairman of the
National Development and Reform Commission.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $792.50 a
metric ton against offers at $795.50, according to brokerage
Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. First-half February cargoes were
bid at $789 a ton compared with offers at $792, data from Ginga
Petroleum showed.  Prices  for mid-January to mid-February delivery rose $8, or
1 percent, to $778.25 a ton yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan naphtha’s difference to Brent crude, or the crack
spread, dropped to $146 a ton from $147.43 at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Stockpiles of the fuel in Japan rose 2.7 percent to 2
million kiloliters in the week ended Nov. 20, the Petroleum
Association of Japan said.  Crude oil in New York traded near the highest settlement in
more than a week after U.S. jobless claims fell to the lowest
level since 2008.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude, or the crack spread, fell
to $13.24 a barrel from $13.33 yesterday, according to brokerage
PVM Oil Associates. December  swaps for gasoil , or diesel, gained
$2.15, or 2.3 percent, to $96.65 a barrel.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil rose to $1.45 a barrel from
$1.40 yesterday. The gap is at the biggest since January. A
wider regrade indicates that aviation fuel is more profitable to
produce compared with diesel.  China used 3 percent less energy for every economic unit
produced in the first nine months compared with a year earlier,
China Daily reported, citing Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the
National Development and Reform Commission.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
losses, widened to $7.57 a barrel from $6.82 yesterday, PVM data
showed. December high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps  rose $9.75, or 2
percent, to $493 a ton, PVM data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
