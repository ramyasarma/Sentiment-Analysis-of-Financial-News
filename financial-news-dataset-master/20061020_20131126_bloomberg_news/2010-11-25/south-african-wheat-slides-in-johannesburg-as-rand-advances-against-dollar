Wheat in  South Africa  fell as the
rand strengthened against the dollar, cutting the cost of
imports for local millers.  The rand traded at 7.0669 to the dollar at 12:05 p.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 7.1149 at the close of grain trading
at noon yesterday.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, declined 23 rand, or 0.9
percent, to close at 2,697 rand ($381) a metric ton. South
Africa is the continent’s fourth-largest producer after Morocco,
Egypt and Algeria.  White corn for delivery in March fell 4 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,321 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South
Africa’s staple food.  Yellow corn for March delivery rose 6 rand, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,401 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal feed in
South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
