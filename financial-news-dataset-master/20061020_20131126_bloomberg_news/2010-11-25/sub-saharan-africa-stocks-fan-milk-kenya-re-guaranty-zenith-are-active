excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Fan Milk Ltd.  (FML GN), a maker of food and dairy products
in Ghana, rose 7 pesewas, or 0.8 percent, to 9.37 cedis, the
highest since at least April 1995. Fan Milk will issue five
bonus shares for every one held, the Accra-based company said in
a Ghana Stock Exchange statement today, setting the qualifying
date at Dec. 17.  Kenya Reinsurance Corp.  (KNRE KN), a state-owned reinsurer,
retreated for the first time in three days, falling 5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to 11.55 shillings, after its risk management was
rated “weak” by A.M. Best Co.  Zenith Bank Plc  (ZENITHBA NL), Nigeria’s biggest lender by
market value, rose the most since Nov. 10, adding 62 kobo, or
4.4 percent, to 14.79 naira.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc  (GUARANTY
NL) climbed 22 kobo, or 1.4 percent, to 15.72 naira. Asset
Management Corp of Nigeria, a state-owned company that will buy
bad debts from the nation’s lenders, said Nov. 9 it would value
those loans at an implied premium of about 60 percent of the 60-
day average price to Nov. 15.  “Evidence of undervaluation is apparent in the current
prices of the healthy banks,” Abiola Razaq, a Lagos-based
analyst at Meristem, said by phone today. “Amcon’s valuation of
the healthy banks is lower than the current prices.” Guaranty’s
60-day moving average price through Nov. 15 was 15.73 naira, or
25.15 naira including the premium, while Zenith’s, including the
premium is 22.66 naira, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
