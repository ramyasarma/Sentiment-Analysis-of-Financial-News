Traders are increasing their bets
that Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  will resume raising
interest rates as soon as next quarter on speculation that
pessimism about the global economic recovery is overdone.  Yields on the June 2011 bankers acceptances contract, a
barometer of short-term rate expectations, rose 16 basis points
in two days after a report showed Canadian inflation grew faster
than all 23 economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted. That’s
the biggest two-day rise since Bank of Canada policy makers last
raised the benchmark overnight rate on Sept. 8. The contract
reached 1.73 percent today, the highest since July 14.  Investors may be “underpricing” the chances that the Bank
of Canada will raise rates next quarter, according to Morgan
Stanley. Carney kept his  key policy rate  unchanged in October
after three successive increases, citing a weaker U.S. outlook.
Since then U.S. and Canadian indicators suggest the growth may
be picking up, making increases more likely.  “Canada has lagged this year largely due to concerns about
the U.S.,” Yilin Nie, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in New
York, said in a phone interview. “What we’re seeing on the
margin is U.S. growth pick up this quarter and continuing to
recover going into next year.”  Nie said that while investors are anticipating an increase
by June, the central bank will have to resume raising  rates 
sooner than that. “To the extent that the Canadian economy
surprises to the upside then the rate path should surprise to
the upside as well,” Nie said.  Holding Rates  The Bank of Canada will hold its policy rate at 1 percent
through the end of the second quarter, according to the median
 forecast  of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey this month.
The median forecast in October was for the target to rise to
1.50 percent by then.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of Canada’s corporations rather than its
federal government remained at 135 basis points, or 1.35
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data. Spreads reached 134 basis points Nov. 16, the narrowest
gap since May. Corporate yields ended yesterday at 3.92 percent.  Relative yields on U.S. corporate bonds ended Nov. 23 at
177 basis points, the Merrill data showed. Global corporate
spreads were 169 basis points.  Canadian corporate bonds have lost 1.3 percent in November,
poised for the worst month since October 2008. U.S. company debt
has lost 0.6 percent in November. Global corporates were also
down 0.6 percent through Nov. 19.  Cara Operations Ltd. paid 667 basis points over government
benchmarks to sell C$200 million in 9.125 percent bonds due in
December 2015.  Provincial Spreads  In provincial bond markets, relative yields narrowed 1
basis point to 52 basis points. They reached 51 basis points on
Nov. 16, the tightest spreads since April, from as wide as 71
basis points on May 21. Yields increased to 3.29 percent from
3.21 percent the day before.  Provincial bonds have lost investors 2.2 percent this
month, the biggest loss since February 1994. Canada’s government
bonds are down 1.9 percent in November.  Quebec reoffered C$250 million of its 4.5 percent bonds due
in December 2019, bringing the total outstanding to C$5 billion.
The debt priced to yield 75.5 basis points over benchmarks.  The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds jumped 8
basis points yesterday to 3.19 percent, the highest since July
29, as the price of the 3.5 percent  security  due in June 2020
dropped 69 cents to C$102.57. The 10-year yield fell one basis
point today to 3.18 percent.  Breakeven Rates  Canadian 10-year breakeven rates, which measure the
difference in yield between inflation-linked and cash bonds and
gauges price expectations, touched 2.31 percent yesterday, the
highest since May 14.  Real yields  -- the yield minus the annual
inflation rate -- widened yesterday to 0.74 percent, from 0.3
percent in October. The gap touched 2.26 percentage points in
June. The breakeven rate was at 2.28 percent today.  Annual  inflation  accelerated to 2.4 percent in October,
from 1.9 percent in the prior month, Statistics Canada said on
Nov. 23. The median forecast of 23 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for an advance to 2.2 percent.  Retail sales rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted
C$36.4 billion in September, the fourth straight gain, led by
automobiles and general merchandise stores. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted a 0.7 percent increase, according to the
median of 22 estimates.  ‘Positive Surprises’  The data are “having some influence” on higher
expectations for rates,  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian currency
and rates strategy at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit,
said via e-mail. “Some positive surprises globally, the
Canadian dollar’s retreat from parity and the ability of
commodities to still hold in” are also contributing to the
expectations.  Americans increased spending for a fifth month in October,
filed the fewest unemployment claims in more than two years last
week and a measure of consumer confidence topped forecasts, U.S.
reports showed yesterday.  Chandler said RBC’s forecast is for the Bank of Canada to
raise rates again in April, so “we think currency valuations
are about right.”  The six-month overnight index swap rate, a measure of what
investors predict the central bank rate will average during that
time, rose to 1.16 percent today, the most since December 2008.  The March 2011 bankers’ acceptance  contract  climbed two
basis points to 1.55 percent today, the most since Sept. 24. So-
called Bax contracts have settled an average of about 18 basis
points above the central bank’s overnight target since 1992,
Bloomberg data show.  “We’re basically pricing almost 25 basis points of hiking
by March,”  David Love  , a trader of interest-rate derivatives
in Montreal at the brokerage Le Groupe Jitney Inc., said by e-
mail. “That’s getting aggressive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
