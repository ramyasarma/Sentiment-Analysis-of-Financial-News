Eskom Holdings Ltd., Africa’s
biggest power generator, said it’s seeking export-quality coal
supplies for shipment through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal.  The state-owned utility plans to set up a joint venture
with a producer to export the fuel together, or to purchase coal
from a supplier and ship the commodity on its own, according to
a request for proposals published on Eskom’s  website .  The coal will be shipped through the company’s Eskom
Enterprises Ltd. unit, which has allocated capacity at Richards
Bay’s South Dunes Coal Terminal Ltd. from March 1 next year to
Aug. 31, 2012, it said. Eskom’s entitlement during the tender
period ranges from 1.14 million metric tons to 1.38 million tons
until April 30, 2012, and from million tons to 1.19 million tons
“thereafter,” it said.  Eskom has the right to use half of South Dunes’ 6 million-
ton capacity.  The utility said in its  annual report  this year it’s
seeking “direction concerning future involvement in South Dunes
Coal Terminal and Golang Coal.” Eskom owns 67 percent of
exporter Golang Coal Ltd.  Eskom’s media unit didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed
questions.
