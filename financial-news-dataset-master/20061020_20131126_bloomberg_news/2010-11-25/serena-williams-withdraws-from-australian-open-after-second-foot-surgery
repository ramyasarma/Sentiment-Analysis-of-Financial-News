Defending champion  Serena Williams 
withdrew from next year’s Australian Open tennis tournament
following a second surgery on her injured foot.  Williams, who’s won five of her 13 Grand Slam singles
titles at Melbourne Park, informed organizers of the season-
opening major of her decision to pull out today.  “While I desperately want to be back on the court and
competing in the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, it is
imperative for my health that I continue to work with my
doctors to ensure my foot heals properly,” Williams said in an
e-mailed statement from Tennis Australia. “This decision,
though heavy on my heart, is the right one.”  Williams, 29, hasn’t played competitively since she
successfully defended her Wimbledon title in July. The American
said she cut her foot on a shard of glass in Germany following
that victory and had surgery later that month. She said today
that she had a second operation last month.  In October, Williams said she wouldn’t be playing for the
rest of 2010 after re-tearing a tendon in her right foot. She
finished the year ranked fourth, as  Caroline Wozniacki  of
Denmark took over the top spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
