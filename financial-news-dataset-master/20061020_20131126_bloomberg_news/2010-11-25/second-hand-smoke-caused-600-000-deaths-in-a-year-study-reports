Second-hand smoke may have killed
more than 600,000 people in 2004, causing one in every 100
deaths, a study estimated.  The main causes of death were heart disease, lower
respiratory infections, asthma and lung cancer, according to the
study published today in the medical journal  The Lancet .
Women accounted for 47 percent of the deaths, children 28
percent and men 26 percent. Deaths in adults were spread evenly
across the globe, the research, led by Annette Pruess-Ustuen of
the  World Health Organization  in Geneva, showed.  “There can be no question that the 1 billion smokers in
the world are exposing billions of non-smokers to second-hand
smoke, a disease-causing indoor air pollutant,” Heather Wipfli
and  Jonathan Samet  of the University of Southern California said
in an accompanying editorial. “Few sources of indoor-air
pollution can be completely eliminated. However, smoking indoors
can be eliminated -- with substantial benefits, as shown by this
new set of estimates.”  The researchers used 2004 data gathered in 192 countries to
estimate deaths and years of good health lost. The study
estimates that 10.9 million years of good health were lost.  The mortalities should be added to the estimated 5.1
million deaths linked to smoking, the authors said.  The research was funded in part by the Swedish National
Board of Health and Welfare and Bloomberg Philanthropies, which
manages the charitable giving of New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg . He is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
