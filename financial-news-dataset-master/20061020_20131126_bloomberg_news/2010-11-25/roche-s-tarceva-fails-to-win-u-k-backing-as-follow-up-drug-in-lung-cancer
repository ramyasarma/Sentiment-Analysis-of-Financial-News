Roche Holding AG’s Tarceva failed to
win the recommendation of the U.K. National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence in a second draft of guidelines for non-
small-cell lung cancer.  More evidence is needed before the agency can recommend the
use of Tarceva as a maintenance treatment for patients whose
disease has remained stable following first-line therapy, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
