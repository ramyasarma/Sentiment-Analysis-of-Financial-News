Telstra Corp. ’s Hong Kong mobile-
phone unit started a fourth-generation network in the city to
meet demand for high-speed wireless services and lift revenue.  The network, based on LTE, or Long Term Evolution,
technology now covers 50 percent of the city’s population,
 Joseph O’Konek , chief executive officer at Telstra’s  CSL Ltd. 
unit, said at a briefing today.  CSL aims to offer 4G services in Hong Kong ahead of rivals
including billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s  Hutchison Telecommunications
Hong Kong Holdings Ltd.  Mobile-phone carriers including the
U.S.’s Verizon Wireless and Japan’s  NTT DoCoMo Inc.  have already
unveiled plans to start the high-speed networks in their home
markets.  Hutchison Telecommunications’ 2.99 million mobile-phone
users in Hong Kong at the end of June makes it the city’s
biggest carrier by subscribers, according to Macquarie Group
Ltd. analyst  Lisa Soh . CSL had 2.64 million at the end of June,
according to Melbourne-based Telstra.  CSL’s new service uses technology supplied by ZTE Corp.,
China’s second-biggest maker of phone-equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
