U.K. stocks advanced, extending
yesterday’s biggest rally for the FTSE 100 Index in almost three
weeks, amid takeover activity in the property industry.  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc surged by a record 13
percent after saying Simon Property Group Inc., the largest U.S.
mall owner, may make a cash offer for company. Anglo American
Plc and Rio Tinto Group led a gauge of mining shares higher as
base metals advanced in London.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  rose 0.7 percent to 5,698.93 at the
close in London. The gauge yesterday rebounded from a three-day
selloff as Ireland unveiled a four-year deficit-cutting plan and
talks on a bailout of Irish banks neared conclusion. The  FTSE
All-Share Index  gained 0.8 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ
Index  declined 1.2 percent.  “The little dose of excitement to today’s equity markets
has come from Capital Shopping Centres,” said London-based
 Joshua Raymond , a market strategist at City Index. “The news
has heightened optimism of consolidation within the sector and
other firms have rallied on the back of this.”  CSC soared 13 percent to 381 pence, snapping five days of
losses, after the U.K.’s largest mall owner said it received a
letter from Simon Property yesterday about a possible offer
exceeding 2.3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).  Rejected Request  CSC disclosed Simon’s intentions while announcing an
agreement to buy the Trafford Centre mall near Manchester,
England, from closely held Peel Group for 747.6 million pounds
in stock and bonds and 852 million pounds of assumed debt.  To help with financing, CSC raised 221.2 million pounds
from selling the equivalent of 9.9 percent of its equity
outstanding to investors today. CSC said it rejected Simon’s
request to delay the purchase and share sale.  Hammerson Plc , the U.K.’s third-largest publicly traded
property company, climbed 4.8 percent to 405.8 pence, British
Land Co., the U.K.’s second-biggest real-estate investment
trust, increased 2.9 percent to 492 pence, while larger rival
Land Securities Group Plc rose 2.4 percent to 654.5 pence.  Anglo American rallied 2.7 percent to 2,985.5 pence as base
metals including copper, lead, nickel and tin advanced on the
London Metal Exchange. Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest
mining company, increased 2.2 percent to 4,269.5 pence. Xstrata
Plc gained 2.1 percent to 1,351 pence.  The following stocks either rose or fell in the U.K. or
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc  (DMGT LN) dropped 20
pence, or 3.5 percent, to 544.5 pence as the publisher of
Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper reported a 4.6 percent drop in
full-year sales to 1.97 billion pounds. The company said it
remains cautious about the medium-term outlook.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc  (MKS LN) rallied 9.1 pence, or
2.4 percent, to 384.1 pence after Arden Partners raised its
recommendation for Britain’s largest retailer to “buy” from
“neutral.”  Separately, the Confederation of British Industry said a
U.K. retail-sales index rose in November and stores expect
momentum to continue next month in the run-up to Christmas.  J
Sainsbury Plc  (SBRY LN), the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket
company, increased 2 percent to 365.3 pence.  Kingfisher Plc  (KGF
LN), Europe’s largest home improvement retailer, gained 2.2
percent to 249.5 pence.  Old Mutual Plc  (OML LN) increased 2.7 pence, or 2.2
percent, to 128.1 pence after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised
its recommendation for the insurer to “buy” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
