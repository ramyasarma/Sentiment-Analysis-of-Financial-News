Spain led declines in the bonds of
the euro region’s most-indebted nations as LCH Clearnet Ltd.
increased its margin requirements, or cost of trading, in Irish
government securities for the third time this month.  Spanish 10-year  yields  rose for an eighth day even as the
nation’s deputy finance minister said the government doesn’t
foresee problems tapping markets. Irish 10-year yields were near
the highest since before the euro’s 1999 debut as the
announcement of a new budget amid European Union-led aid talks
failed to reverse investor sentiment. French, Dutch and Italian
bonds declined as European Central Bank board member  Axel Weber 
said the regional rescue fund could be ramped up if needed.  “Liquidity has been a problem for Irish bonds for about a
month and the margin requirements are just another nail in the
coffin,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank. “The new way to
play the spread-widening trade is through Portugal and Spain.”  The Spanish 10-year yield climbed 12 basis points to 5.21
percent as of 4:12 p.m. in London. The 4.85 percent security due
October 2020 fell 0.955, or 9.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,334)
face amount, to 97.225. Irish 10-year yields were 12 basis
points higher at 9.25 percent, while similar-maturity Portuguese
yields climbed seven basis points to 7.24 percent.  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, rose one basis points to 2.72 percent after
reaching 2.75 percent. French 10-year bond yields climbed four
basis points to 3.14 percent, while  Dutch yields  were five basis
points higher at 2.94 percent.  Boosting Margin Requirements  The euro snapped a three-day decline, trading 0.2 percent
stronger to $1.3364 versus $1.3335 yesterday. The Stoxx Europe
600 Index of shares dropped 0.1 percent. U.S. markets are closed
for the Thanksgiving holiday today.  The increase in margin for Irish trading will be based on
outstanding positions at the close of business, LCH said on its
 website  today. The world’s No. 2 bonds clearing house said on
Nov. 10 it would add a 15 percent extra margin requirement to
Irish bond trades through its RepoClear service. On Nov. 17, it
raised the extra margin to 30 percent of net positions.  Spain’s funding for the rest of 2010 remains
“comfortable,” helped by better-than-forecast revenue and a
shrinking deficit, and the government doesn’t expect problems
tapping financial markets, said Deputy Finance Minister  Jose Manuel Campa .  Spain, whose borrowing  costs  have surged to an eight-year
high this week, has two more bond auctions scheduled this year.
The Treasury will sell three-year debt on Dec. 2, and 10- and
15-year securities on Dec. 16. The government has about 8
billion euros still to raise this year, according to the state
borrowing plan.  Emergency Measures  “We have increased and front-loaded our fiscal
consolidation,” Campa said in an interview at the finance
ministry in Madrid late yesterday. “The revenues are actually
above budget, so our financial conditions are better than we
anticipated, so our financial position in terms of funding for
the remaining month and a half is quite comfortable.”  ECB Executive Board member  Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell  said
the ECB is phasing out its emergency stimulus measures as banks
find it easier to fund themselves.  “We are in a period where we don’t think that we would
need additional measures,” she said in an interview with the
Insead Knowledge website that was conducted on Nov. 23. Banks
are “much more stable and able to get their own funding.”  Fully Funded  While Ireland is fully funded until the middle of next
year, the yield on Irish 10-year bonds soared to a record 652
basis points above bunds on Nov. 11 on concern the cost of
bailing out banks would overwhelm government finances.  Ireland requested a bailout from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund on Nov. 21. The nation’s bonds rose
the following day before plunging the following two days,
pushing the 10-year yield up by 82 basis points, or 0.82
percentage point.  Greece entered a 110 billion-euro rescue program in April
before the creation of the 750 billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility in May as a backstop for the common currency.  Greek 10-year yields fell two basis points to 12.05
percent. Italian 10-year yields rose four basis points to 4.39
percent today.  ‘Lost Cause’  “Seven hundred and fifty billion should be enough to
assure the markets,” Weber said at an event in Paris late
yesterday. “If not, it will have to be increased,” he said.  Portugal’s three-year government bond yield rising above
the likely cost of loans from the EFSF makes its recourse to a
bailout more likely, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  “For Portugal, attempts to forestall seeking independent
financial aid are just about a lost cause,”  Derek Halpenny ,
head of European currency strategy in London, wrote today in an
e-mailed research note.  Three-year euro interest-rate swaps are at about 1.8
percent, while the EFSF charges an additional 350 basis points,
for an estimated funding cost of 5.3 percent, Halpenny wrote.  The three-year bond yield was at 5.5 percent today. It rose
as high as 5.79 percent on Nov. 11.  Italian borrowing costs increased at a sale of 8.5 billion
euros of six-month treasury bills as fallout from Ireland’s debt
crisis sent financing costs higher in other nations in the
region.  The 182-day securities were priced to yield 1.483 percent,
compared with 1.203 percent at a sale on Oct. 26, data from the
Bank of Italy showed today. The treasury also sold 2 billion
euros of zero-coupon bonds due in August 2012 to yield 2.307
percent, more than the 1.767 percent at the October auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
