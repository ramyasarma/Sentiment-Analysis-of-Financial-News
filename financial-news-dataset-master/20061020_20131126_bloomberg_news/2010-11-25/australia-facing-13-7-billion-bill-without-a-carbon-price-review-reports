Australia’s government faces a A$14
billion bill to meet its lowest emissions targets if it doesn’t
implement a carbon price, the Australian Financial Review said,
citing a report by the Climate Institute to be released today.
This would be the cost of buying carbon reductions
internationally to cut emissions by 5 percent below 2000 levels
by 2020, according to the report. If Australia raises its target
to 15 percent, the cost rises to A$18 billion, the newspaper
said. A carbon price of A$30 per tonne of emissions rising to
A$50 by 2020 would eliminate these costs and raise A$3.6
billion, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
