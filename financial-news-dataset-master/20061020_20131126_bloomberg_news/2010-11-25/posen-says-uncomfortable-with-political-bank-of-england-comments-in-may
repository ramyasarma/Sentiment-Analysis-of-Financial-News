Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  said that he and another member of the Monetary Policy
Committee felt the central bank’s backing of government spending
cuts in the  May inflation report  was “too political.”  “There was a difference of opinion at the MPC in the May
meeting over a particular paragraph in the report talking about
the need for a particular speed with which to deal with the
fiscal policy,” Posen said in testimony to lawmakers today.
“At least one other member plus me were concerned that that
language was too political, too much of a statement.”  Posen was asked about the disagreement after the Financial
Times this month cited unidentified officials as saying some
Bank of England policy makers were unhappy with comments by
Governor  Mervyn King  backing the government’s budget plan.  King said May 12 that he was “very pleased” with the new
government’s deficit-cutting proposals. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  last month detailed plans for the
deepest  spending cuts  since World War II.  Posen, who didn’t identify the other policy maker concerned
about the bank’s fiscal stance, said he was “a little annoyed
and upset” that somebody at the bank had spoken to the
newspaper.  He said the bank’s position on spending cuts had been
discussed by the MPC, and that “the majority of the committee
decided they were comfortable with the language.”  “My strong bias is that, except for those very rare
occasions and particularly in election cycles, we don’t”
comment on fiscal policy, other than in the way it affects the
bank’s forecasts, Posen said.  -- Editor:  John Fraher   To contact the reporter on this story:
