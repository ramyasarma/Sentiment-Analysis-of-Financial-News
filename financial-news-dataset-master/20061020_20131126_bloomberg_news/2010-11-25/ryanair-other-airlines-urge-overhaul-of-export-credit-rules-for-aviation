Ryanair Holdings Plc , Emirates and
eight other airlines said they’ll support the extension of
export-credit support to carriers barred from receiving it
provided the guarantees aren’t curbed or made more costly.  The airlines, which include Korean Air Lines Co. and Abu
Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, said in a statement there must be no
increase in fees, no limit on the amount of credit extended to
any one airline and no reduction in the proportion of the cost
of an aircraft that can be financed.  Airlines from Airbus SAS’s home countries of France,
Germany, Britain and Spain and from the U.S., where Boeing Co.
is based, are currently excluded from receiving export credit to
help fund plane purchases. Paris-based Air France-KLM Group Plc
is among barred companies that say the distinction gives an
unfair advantage to carriers including Dubai-based Emirates.  “We are calling for the ‘home-country’ rule to be removed,
export credit structures to be enhanced, and the maintaining of
existing exposure fees and structures governing the proportion
of an aircraft that can be financed using export credits,” said
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer  Howard Millar , who is acting as
spokesman for the group, calling itself the Aviation Alliance.  The other airlines in the group are Oman Air, Virgin Blue
Holdings Ltd. of Australia, freight operator Cargolux Airlines
International SA and European discount carriers Wizz Air Ltd.,
Pegasus Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
