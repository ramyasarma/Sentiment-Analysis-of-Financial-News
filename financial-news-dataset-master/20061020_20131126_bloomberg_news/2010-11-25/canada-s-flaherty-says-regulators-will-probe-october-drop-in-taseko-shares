Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said securities regulators will investigate a sudden
drop in Taseko Mines Ltd. shares on Oct. 14.  Flaherty made the comments to reporters today in Ottawa.  Taseko’s shares fell as much as 34 percent on Oct. 14, the
largest intraday drop since 1990, and the company’s management
said it wasn’t aware of any reason for the decline.  Taseko was seeking federal approval to develop its
Prosperity deposit, 125 kilometers (78 miles) southwest of
Williams Lake. Former Environment Minister Jim Prentice said on
Nov. 2 he wouldn’t allow the project to go ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
