Clifford Chance LLP , the U.K.’s
highest-grossing law firm, said  Geraint Hughes  will succeed
Chris Wyman as its practice head for India, a market that is
closed to foreign law firms.  Hughes, 43, will remain based in Singapore where he is
managing partner of Clifford Chance’s office, Senior Partner
 Stuart Popham  said.  Wyman, 55, has reached his long planned retirement after 30
years with the firm, Popham said. Wyman leaves after spending 16
months assigned to the offices of its allied firm in India  AZB &
Partners . India prohibits foreign lawyers from practising law or
setting up offices in the country, a ban Popham said in July
that he expected to be lifted by 2012.  Popham declined to comment on the tie-up with AZB,
established last year, on whether there would be more work from
India for Clifford Chance, or on his 2012 target for
liberalization.  Wyman  said that his retirement was already four-and-a-half
years later than he had originally intended.  He said that he would retire from legal practice and was
considering several other work options. His Indian assignment,
originally planned to last three months, had lasted 16 months
with short breaks, he said.  The High Court in Chennai is currently hearing a case
against 31 foreign law firms that are allegedly practising law
illegally. A hearing in the case was adjourned again yesterday
to January 2011 to enable Indian lawyers’ regulatory body the
Bar Council of India to take a position on the entry of foreign
law firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
