Sparkle Roll Group Ltd. , which
distributes Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini cars in China, tumbled
the most in almost two years after first-half profit declined
because of higher expenses.  The stock fell as much as 15 percent in Hong Kong, the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 10, 2008, and traded 9.3
percent lower at HK$1.28 as of 12:06 p.m.  First-half net income  declined  8.6 percent from a year
earlier to HK$32.6 million ($4.2 million) due to expenses
related to options and convertible bonds, according to the
company’s filing to the stock exchange.  Sparkle Roll, based in Hong Kong, has  gained  91 percent
this year, compared with a 5.8 percent increase in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
