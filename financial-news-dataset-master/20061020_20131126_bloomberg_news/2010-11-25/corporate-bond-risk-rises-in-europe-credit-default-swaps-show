The cost of insuring bonds sold by
European banks rose for a sixth day on concern other governments
will follow Ireland in forcing investors to share the cost of
bailouts.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on subordinated debt of 25 European banks and insurers rose 4
basis points to a five-month high of 272 as of 3:30 p.m. in
London, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Concern about the cost
of financial-industry rescues also helped push a gauge of
government debt risk to a record.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  wants investors to foot
more of the bill in future bank bailouts and this week proposed
that buyers of new euro-region debt accept liability clauses
starting in 2011, two years before a revamped crisis-management
system kicks in. Nationalized  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  said it
will wipe out investors who refused to accept an 80 percent
discount on some of its subordinated bonds.  Banks are “becoming a risky investment as sovereigns are
struggling with their own refinancing costs, and Ireland is the
best example of that,” said  Tim Brunne , a Munich-based
strategist at UniCredit SpA. “The first line of defense would
be to let sub investors participate in the losses.”  Markit Group Ltd.’s index of subordinated financial swaps
is up from 225.5 on Nov. 19, setting it on pace for the biggest
weekly increase since March 2009, JPMorgan Chase data show. The
senior index rose 1.5 basis points to 159 today, up from 135.5
at the end of last week.  SovX to Record  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of contracts on
15 governments rose 3 basis points to a record 184, according to
CMA. Spain increased 8 basis points to an all-time high based on
closing prices of 303 and Ireland jumped 11.5 basis points to
591, after earlier reaching a record.  Ireland has also pledged to impose losses on junior
bondholders at Irish Nationwide Building Society. The government
took over Anglo Irish in January 2009 as loan losses spiralled
after a property bubble burst, and is preparing to take a
majority stake in rivals  Bank of Ireland Plc  and  Allied Irish
Banks Plc .  Credit-default swaps on Portugal rose 6 basis points to
487, matching the highest ever on closing prices, CMA prices
show. Italy was 4 basis points higher at 205.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 3 basis points to 484,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings climbed 1.25 basis
points to 107.75.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company or country fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A
basis point on a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
