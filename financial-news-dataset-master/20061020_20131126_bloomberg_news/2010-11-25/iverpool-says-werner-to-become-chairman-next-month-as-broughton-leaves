Liverpool soccer club said Tom
Werner will become chairman at the start of next month as Martin
Broughton leaves the post after leading the sale of the team.  Werner is also chairman of New England Sports Ventures,
which last month purchased England’s most successful soccer team
for 300 million pounds ($472 million), 81 million pounds more
than Tom Hicks and George Gillett paid for it in February 2007.
Hicks and Gillett were forced to sell to repay 200 million
pounds of the club’s 351 million pounds of debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
