Captain Lewis Moody is among four
players returning to the England rugby team for this weekend’s
international Test against South Africa.  Mike Tindall, Dan Cole and Tom Croft will also start the
match in two days at Twickenham Stadium after manager Martin
Johnson made four changes to the side in last week’s 26-13 win
over Samoa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
