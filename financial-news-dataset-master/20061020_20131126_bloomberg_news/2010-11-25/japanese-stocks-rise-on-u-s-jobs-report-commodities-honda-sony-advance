Japanese  stocks  climbed after U.S.
reports showed employment and consumer sentiment improved,
boosting confidence in a global economic recovery and driving
commodity prices higher.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.1
percent.  Sony Corp. , an electronics maker that gets 70 percent
of its sales abroad, gained 0.8 percent after Mizuho Securities
Co. recommended the stock. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest
commodities trader, increased 0.6 percent after oil and metal
prices climbed. Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd., an electric-
wire maker, increased 2 percent on a Nikkei newspaper report
that the company will start mass producing superconductor cables.  “If the U.S. economy improves further, it is realistic to
expect the dollar to appreciate,” and that will benefit
exporters, said  Takeshi Osawa , a senior fund manager in Tokyo at
Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$22 billion. “The stock market will continue to climb slowly
toward the end of the year.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 10,079.76
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  index
gained 0.4 percent to 869.81, with more than twice as many
stocks advancing as falling.  The Nikkei 225 has increased 9.5 percent this month. Stocks

earnings  on average, compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500
and 11.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  U.S. Economy  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 1.5 percent yesterday, the most in four
days, after the U.S. Labor Department said jobless claims fell
to 407,000 last week. The median projection of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a drop to 435,000. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of November
consumer sentiment increased to 71.6, the highest level since
June and exceeding the median economist estimate of 69.5.  “The global economy is certainly improving, so we don’t
have to be pessimistic about the economic outlook,” said
 Hideaki Higashi , a strategist in Tokyo at SMBC Friend Securities
Co. “The market should become more active.”  Toyota advanced 1.1 percent to 3,305 yen, the highest close
since June 16, and was the most actively traded stock by value
in Japan. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest carmaker,
climbed 0.7 percent to 3,085 yen. Sony increased 0.8 percent to
2,894 yen as the company was raised to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Mizuho Securities.  Oil, Metals Advance  Mitsubishi rose 0.6 percent to 2,128 yen and Mitsui & Co.,
which counts commodities as its largest source of profit,
advanced 0.4 percent to 1,335 yen.  Crude oil for January delivery surged 3.2 percent yesterday
in New York to $83.86 a barrel, the biggest gain since July 22.
The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
metals including copper and aluminum increased 1.4 percent
yesterday after three consecutive declines.  Sumitomo Electric Industries, which makes electric wires,
leapt 2 percent to 1,102 yen, the highest since June 24. The
Nikkei newspaper reported the company will start mass production
of superconductor cables from 2011.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. , the operator of the world’s
largest merchant fleet, increased 1.4 percent to 567 yen. The
company was awarded a “long-term” contract from Vale SA for
two large ore carriers, Mitsui said in a statement.  Investment Recommendations  Analysts’ recommendations also buoyed stocks such as
Komatsu Ltd. and Daihatsu Motor Co.  Komatsu , the world’s second-largest maker of mining trucks
and excavators, gained 2.8 percent to 2,390 yen, the highest
since August 2008. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. iterated its “buy”
rating on the company because of stronger-than-expected demand
for construction machinery in China.  Daihatsu Motor , an automaker, jumped 3.4 percent to 1,193
yen, a level not seen since September 2008, after a Deutsche
Bank AG analyst increased the 12-month share price estimate on
the company to 1,400 yen from 1,250 yen, citing increasing sales
of cars in members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  “Profits are increasing at companies benefitting from not
only China but also from ASEAN nations,” Norinchukin’s Osawa
said. “It’s good that reliance on the U.S. is decreasing.”  Mitsubishi Electric Corp., which makes electronics goods,
rose 2.7 percent to 837 yen. The company had its rating
increased to “overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase &
Co., which said the company will likely post a record  profit  in
the year ending March 2012.  To contact the reporter for this story:
