European stocks were little changed
as the national indexes of the peripheral euro area nations
declined, offsetting gains by real-estate stocks.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was unchanged at 266.3
at 2:14 p.m. in London, after earlier gaining as much as 0.6
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
