Japan’s 10-year government  bonds 
fell for a second day, pushing yields to an 11-week high, after
a report showed declines in consumer prices moderated.  Ten-year bonds completed a seventh weekly loss, the longest
losing streak since April 2006, before the Ministry of Finance
sells 2.2 trillion yen ($26 billion) of 10-year debt on Dec. 1.
Bonds futures slid to a five-month low after the ministry
reported today that foreign investors sold a net 217.5 billion
yen in Japanese bonds last week. The  difference  in yield between
10- and 2-year securities increased to the most in 11 weeks.  “Excessive pessimism about the economic outlook has
disappeared for now,” said  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst
in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-
largest banking group. “People don’t see a reason to start
buying bonds again.”  The yield on the 1 percent bond due September 2020 rose 2.5
basis points to 1.18 percent as of 3:01 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.216 yen to 98.418 yen. The yield reached 1.185
percent earlier, the highest since Sept. 6.  Ten-year yields have gained 11 basis points this week, the
biggest gain since the week ended Sept. 3. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery slid 0.53 to
140.57 as of the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They
touched 140.50, the lowest for a lead contract since June 22.  Prices, Auction  Consumer prices  excluding fresh food fell 0.6 percent in
October from a year earlier after dropping 1.1 percent in
September, the statistics bureau said today in Tokyo, matching
the median forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Overall consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from a year ago, the
first increase since December 2008.  The prior 10-year bond sale on Nov. 2 drew bids worth 3.91
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.85 at the October sale. Primary dealers, which
are required to bid at government debt sales, often reduce
holdings of bonds in case prices decline before they can pass on
the new securities to investors.  “It’s hard to expect a lot of buying before next week’s
10-year bond auction,”  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in Tokyo, wrote in a note today.
“Ten-year yields are heading for 1.195 percent.”  ‘Deteriorate Further’  Losses in bonds were limited on speculation high yields are
enough to encourage investors to buy the securities.  “Yields around 1.2 percent should be attractive to
investors,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin
Research Institute Co. in Tokyo. “I expect yields to go down
toward year-end, as I see a risk domestic economic reports will
deteriorate further.”  Ten-year yields may fall to as low as 1 percent by the end
of December, Minami said. Should his forecast prove accurate,
investors who buy the securities today will make a 1.7 percent
return, according to Bloomberg calculations.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold 10-year debt
over two-year notes rose to 1 percentage point today, the most
since Sept. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
