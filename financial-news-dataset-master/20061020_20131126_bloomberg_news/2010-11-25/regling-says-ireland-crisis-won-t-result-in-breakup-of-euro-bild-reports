Klaus Regling, chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, said there
is no danger the Irish debt crisis will lead to a breakup of the
euro, although he called the situation “serious,” Bild Zeitung
reported, citing an interview.  Regling said the rescue package is big enough for all member
states, according to the German newspaper. The EFSF head said
neither France nor Italy are at risk, Bild reported. Regling
rejected the suggestion that Germany is the “paymaster” of the
crisis, according to the newspaper.  Germany gains from its contribution to the guarantees from
the fees it derives, Bild cited Regling as saying. Regling also
said talks with 150 of the world’s biggest investors show there
is high interest in buying the bonds issued by the rescue fund,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
