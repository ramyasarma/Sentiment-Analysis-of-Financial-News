CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, will not sell its renewable energy unit on the
stock market “in the near future” because it’s too small,
spokesman  Ladislav Kriz  said.  The power producer met “twice or three times” with JP
Morgan Chase & Co. representatives earlier this year to discuss
a partial sale on the bourse before ruling it out because of the
unit’s insufficient size, Kriz said today in a telephone
interview.  The utility considered selling about 25 percent of the unit
on the bourse to raise about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion),
Lidove Noviny reported today without citing anyone.  Kriz said the plan has been halted because the company
isn’t willing to make significant investments in renewable
energy at the moment.  “JP Morgan told us the unit would have to be several times
larger than it is to be interesting for investors,” Kriz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
