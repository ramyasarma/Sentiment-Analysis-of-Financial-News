Rio Tinto Group ,  Woolworths Ltd.  and
 Qantas Airways Ltd.  chiefs will meet in Canberra tomorrow to
discuss the best way for Australia to manage climate change.  Nineteen executives from companies with A$225 billion ($220
billion) in revenue and employing 380,000 Australians will
discuss how to reduce emissions while at the same time
delivering  economic  growth and creating jobs, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  and Climate Change Minister  Greg Combet  said in a statement.  “Business leaders will be at the front line of managing
this transformation to a low carbon economy,” the ministers
said, adding that the Business Roundtable on Climate Change will
meet regularly until the end of 2011.  Australia, where coal accounts for more than 80 percent of
power production, is trying to establish a price for carbon
emissions. A separate Multi-Party Climate Change Committee,
which includes Labor and non-party lawmakers, is looking at
options including an emissions trading plan, a tax on pollution
and setting renewable energy targets by using more wind or solar
power.  The business roundtable includes  National Australia Bank
Ltd.  Chief Executive officer  Cameron Clyne ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. 
metallurgical coal president  Hubie van Dalsen , Rio’s managing
director for Australia  David Peever , AGL Energy Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Fraser , Qantas Chief Executive Officer
 Alan Joyce , Woolworth’s Chief Executive Officer  Michael Luscombe 
and  Woodside Petroleum Ltd.  Chief Executive Officer  Don Voelte .  To contact the reporter on this story:
