Australia fast bowler  Peter Siddle 
took a hat trick on day one of the series-opening Ashes cricket
Test against England in Brisbane.  Siddle, 26 today, removed England opener Alastair Cook (67),
wicketkeeper Matt Prior (0) and all-rounder Stuart Broad (0) in
consecutive deliveries in his 12th over to put the home team in
control in the final session.  It was the 11th hat trick by an Australian in Test cricket
and first since  Glenn McGrath  against the West Indies in the
2000-2001 season. The feat has now been achieved  38 times  in 133
years of elite Test cricket.  England captain Andrew Strauss earlier won the toss and
opted to bat first amid overcast conditions at the Gabba, where
Australia is unbeaten in  21 matches  going back to 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
