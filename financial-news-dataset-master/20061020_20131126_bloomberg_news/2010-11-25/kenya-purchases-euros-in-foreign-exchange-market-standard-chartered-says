Kenya’s  central bank bought 5
million euros ($6.65 million) in the domestic foreign-exchange
market today, said Dickson Magecha, a trader at Standard
Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd.  Nancy Song, a spokeswoman for the  Central Bank of Kenya ,
couldn’t immediately comment when called today in Nairobi, the
capital. The bank bought a similar amount of euros on Nov. 22 to
boost reserves and support the government’s external payments,
said an official who couldn’t be identified in line with central
bank policy.  Kenya’s gross foreign-exchange reserves increased to $3.9
billion in August, equivalent to about four months of import
cover, from $3.6 billion a year earlier, according to the
central bank’s website.  The shilling was unchanged today at 80.40 shillings per
dollar. The central bank’s purchase of euros had no impact on
the currency as private companies have scaled down trade in
foreign currency as the year-end approaches, Magecha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
