Burkina Faso  President  Blaise Compaore  was elected to a fourth term, extending his 23-year
rule as the leader of one of the world’s poorest countries.  Compaore, 59, won 80.2 percent of ballots cast Nov. 21,
said Moussa Michel Tapsoba, president of the country’s electoral
commission. Hama Arba Diallo was the second-highest vote getter,
with 8.2 percent. Voter turnout was 55 percent, Tapsoba told
reporters in Ouagadougou today.  A complaint by opposition parties of irregularities was not
enough to “affect the freedom, credibility and transparency” of
the ballot, said the  Economic Community of West African States ,
which observed the election.  Candidates have 48 hours to register complaints with the
country’s Constitutional Council, which will declare the final
results, Tapsoba said.  Compaore has ruled the landlocked West African nation since
he seized power in a coup in 1987. Burkina Faso is “heavily
dependent” on exports of cotton and gold, according to the
African Development Bank. The country ranks 161st out of 169
countries on the United Nations’ Human Development Index, which
measures life expectancy, education and income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
