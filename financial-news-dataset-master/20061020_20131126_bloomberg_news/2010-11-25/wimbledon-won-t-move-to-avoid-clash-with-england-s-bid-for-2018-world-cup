The  Wimbledon Championships  won’t be
moved to avoid a possible clash with England’s bid to stage the
 2018 soccer World Cup , an All England Club spokesman said.  An evaluation report into the England 2018 bid released
last week by  FIFA  had pointed out a clash between the tennis
Grand Slam event and the soccer tournament.  “It is a FIFA requirement that no other major sporting
event is hosted in a host city during the event period and the
fact that the Wimbledon tennis championships take place in
London during late June/early July could have an impact on the
public attention given to the FIFA World Cup,” soccer’s world
governing body said in the report.  “We haven’t been approached,” by the England bid
organizers, Wimbledon spokesman  Johnny Perkins  said in an
interview at tennis’s  ATP World Tour Finals  at the O2 arena in
east London. “Even if there had been an approach, we can’t just
move it,” he added. The tennis year runs from January until
November and features 62 men’s events and 53 women’s
tournaments..  In the experience of Wimbledon organizers, having two major
sports events at the same time can have a positive effect on
both, Perkins said.  “When England hosted Euro96, it was fantastic,” Perkins
said. “There was a huge mutually supportive sports
atmosphere.”  The Wimbledon Championships will be held June 20 through
July 3 next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
