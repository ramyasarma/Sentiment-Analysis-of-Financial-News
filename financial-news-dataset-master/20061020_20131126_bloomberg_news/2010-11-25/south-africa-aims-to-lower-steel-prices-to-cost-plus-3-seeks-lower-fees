(Corrects to remove reference to steel prices in first
paragraph.)  South Africa aims to price iron ore
from a portion of Sishen mine at cost plus 3 percent, government
spokesman  Vusi Mona  told reporters in Pretoria today.  The country eventually wants to move to a “developmental
pricing model” for steel that will push prices to the lowest
quartile compared with global charges, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
