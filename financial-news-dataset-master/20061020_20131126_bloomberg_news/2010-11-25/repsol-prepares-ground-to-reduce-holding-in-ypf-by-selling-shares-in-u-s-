Repsol YPF SA , Spain’s biggest oil
company, said it filed a request with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to be able to sell shares representing as
much as 15 percent of its  Argentine  unit YPF SA.  The request will offer Repsol a “flexible framework” to
carry out the sale of YPF shares in the way that it considers
more convenient at each moment, Madrid-based Repsol said today
in a regulatory  filing .  The Spanish company wants to sell part of its 84 percent
holding in YPF “sooner rather than later,” Repsol Chief
Executive Officer  Antonio Brufau  said on April 29. The shares
may be sold to institutions or in the stock market and Repsol
will keep at least 51 percent of YPF, he said. In 2008 Repsol
delayed a public offering of a stake in YPF.  Repsol  may raise about $3 billion from the sale of a 20
percent stake in YPF through a stock offering in Buenos Aires
and New York, Argentine investor  Sebastian Eskenazi  said on May
19. Eskenazi, whose family bought 15 percent of YPF from Repsol
for $2.2 billion in December 2007, expects to exercise an option
to boost the stake to 25 percent by 2012 this year.  Oil and gas production at Repsol’s upstream division, which
doesn’t include the YPF unit, rose 5.8 percent from a year
earlier to 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the third
quarter. Output from Buenos Aires-based YPF fell 2.7 percent to
551,000 barrels a day as mature fields declined.  Repsol forecasts annual production growth of as much as 4
percent through 2014 as projects in Brazil and Peru come
onstream. The company plans to invest 28.5 billion euros in the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
