Oil markets are poised to enter
backwardation, with prompt-delivery prices higher than those for
later supply, as demand for crude increases around the world,
according to Barclays Plc.  “Global spare crude capacity has fallen this year and is
likely to end the year at only a little above 5 percent,” a
team led by  Paul Horsnell , head of commodities research at
Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a report yesterday. ``We
expect a more volatile and backwardated market to emerge 
rapidly.”  West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark grade,
hasn't been in backwardation since November 2008 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The January delivery contract traded 56
cents below the February contract on the Nymex at 10:40 a.m. 
London time today. Oman futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange
went into backwardation Nov. 15, with the January contract 
trading at $83.50 a barrel today, a 3-cent premium to February.  World oil demand rose by 2.41 million barrels a day this
year, the second-strongest rate in the past 30 years, according
to Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
