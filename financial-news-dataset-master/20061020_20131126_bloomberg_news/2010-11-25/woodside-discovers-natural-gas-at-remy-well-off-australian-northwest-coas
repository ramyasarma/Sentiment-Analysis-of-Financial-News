Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , seeking
reserves to expand its A$13 billion ($12.7 billion) Pluto gas
project, said it made a discovery off northwest Australia.  The Remy-1 well in the Carnarvon Basin intersected about 33
meters (108 feet) and 39 meters of gas in two areas, the Perth-
based company said in a statement today. Woodside, Australia’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, said in August it made
discoveries at the Larsen Deep and Alaric prospects.  Woodside’s exploration campaign to find more gas to feed
the Pluto venture will continue into next year, the company said
last month. The company agreed in October to acquire  Hess
Corp.’s  50 percent stake in a permit off Australia. After the
transaction is completed, Woodside will own all of the permit.  Pluto, one of more than a dozen proposed Australian
liquefied natural gas projects targeting Asian demand, is set to
become the fastest venture of its kind built, with the initial
discovery of the field in 2005, Woodside has said. The company
delayed a decision to expand the project until next year after
its exploration program progressed slower than expected.  The Remy prospect is 500 meters south of Woodside’s Martell
gas discovery, Woodside said. The Alaric well off northwest
Australia encountered about 185 meters of gas, while Larsen Deep
intersected 50 meters of gas, Woodside said in August.  Woodside  rose 0.3 percent to A$40.90 at 3:33 p.m. in Sydney
trading while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
