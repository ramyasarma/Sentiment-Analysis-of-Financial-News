European jet-fuel barges traded at a
lower premium to gasoil on London’s ICE Futures exchange even as
stockpiles decreased and cargoes arrived from Singapore.  Gasoline  barge prices rose as Gunvor International Ltd.
bought lots. Inventories of the motor fuel plunged to the lowest
level in more than two years.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $766 to $773 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals
yesterday at $752 and $760 a ton.  Gunvor bought 3,000 tons of the 7,000 tons that changed
hands. BP Plc and RWE AG were among the sellers. The trades are
for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished
automotive fuel.  Gasoline inventories  in independent storage in the ARA oil-
trading hub plummeted 21 percent to 482,000 tons in the week to
today, the lowest level since Sept. 25, 2008, according to PJK
International BV, an industry consultant in Oosterhout,
Netherlands. Cargoes exported to Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria and the
U.S. outnumbered imports from Finland, France, Russia, Sweden
and the U.K.  Gasoline’s crack  widened to $5.15 a barrel, the highest
level since Oct. 18, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker in London. That compares with $4.90 yesterday.  Naphtha’s crack climbed to $1.80 a barrel from $1.70
yesterday, according to PVM. Naphtha is used in gasoline and
petrochemical production.  Middle Distillates  Jet-fuel barges  traded at premiums of $57 and $58 to
December ICE gasoil, according to a survey of brokers and
traders monitoring the Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30
p.m. in London. That compares to yesterday’s trade at a premium
of $59 a ton. BP, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and Total SA were the
buyers of at least 2,000 tons each.  Jet-fuel stockpiles declined 7.5 percent to 713,000 tons
even as cargoes arrived from Singapore, according to PJK.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel traded at premiums of $21 and $22 a
ton to December ICE gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That’s in
line with trades yesterday.  Gasoil for December increased 1.3 percent to $728.75 a ton
on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. That compares with
$719.25 yesterday. The fuel for January delivery gained 1
percent to $731.25 a ton compared with $724 yesterday.  Gasoil barges traded six times at discounts of $6 a ton to
December ICE gasoil, according to the survey of Platts prices.
That compares with yesterday’s trades at discounts of $5 to $6 a
ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, expanded to
$11.95 a barrel from $11.34 yesterday, according to ICE data.
That’s the highest premium since Nov. 17.  Brent for January was little changed at $86.14 a barrel
from $85.84 yesterday, according to ICE data.  Refinery News  Kuwait began a partial shutdown of the Mina al Ahmadi
refinery, its largest oil-processing plant, yesterday to conduct
maintenance that will reduce diesel and low-sulfur fuel oil
supplies.  Maintenance will be done on a hydrocracker and two of the
460,000 barrel-a-day refinery’s desulfurization units. The
hydrocracker will be offline for 40 days and the desulfurization
units for about four weeks.  Grupa Lotos SA, Poland’s second-largest oil refiner, said a
newly built hydrocracker for diesel production at its Gdansk
refinery will begin operations in late 2010 or early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
