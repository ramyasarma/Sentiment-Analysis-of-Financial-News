The rand pared gains versus the
dollar and South Africa’s benchmark bond rose, lowering its
yield, after a report showed producer prices rose by less than
expected.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy traded 0.1 percent
stronger at 7.0584 per dollar at 11:33 a.m. in Johannesburg
after earlier appreciating as much as 0.4 percent from a close
of 7.0664 yesterday. The benchmark 13.5 percent government
security due September 2015 added 8 cents to 125.195 rand,
reducing the yield by 2 basis points to 7.188 percent.  Producer prices increased an annual 6.4 percent after
gaining 6.8 percent in September, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The median estimate of
18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.8 percent. Prices fell
0.4 percent in the month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
