Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. ,
Japan’s biggest telecommunications company, aims to increase
operating profit from overseas businesses to more than $500
million in the year ending March 2013.  The company is targeting an operating profit margin of more
than 5 percent on $10 billion in overseas sales, Chief Financial
Officer  Hiroo Unoura  said today in an interview at the company’s
Tokyo headquarters. NTT’s overseas businesses will “just about
break even” on an operating basis in the current year, he said.  NTT agreed in July to buy  Dimension Data  for 2.1 billion
pounds ($3.3 billion) to build its business abroad and expand in
computer services as the domestic market slows. The company is
considering other overseas deals to boost its security and cloud
businesses and gain access to locally recognized brand names,
Unoura said, adding NTT is “still weak” in South America.  NTT  fell 0.5 percent to 3,785 yen at the 11 a.m. trading
break in Tokyo, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose 0.4 percent. The company, which owns a controlling stake in
 NTT Data Corp. , has risen 3.7 percent this year.  “We can’t grow without increasing our business with
foreign companies,” the 61-year-old executive said. “We might
end up needing a brand name other than NTT to do that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
