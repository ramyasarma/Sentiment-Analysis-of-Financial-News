Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc ,
the largest U.K. mall owner, agreed to buy the Trafford Centre
near Manchester in northwest England for 747.6 million pounds
($1.2 billion) in shares and bonds, the highest price ever paid
for a British retail property.  CSC would assume 852 million pounds of debt under the terms
of the purchase from closely held  Peel Group , the London-based
company said in a statement today. Its stock rose the most in
more than two years in London after  Simon Property Group Inc. ,
the U.S. mall owner that holds 5.6 percent of the stock, said it
may make a cash offer for CSC.  “The transaction fits well with the strategy of
establishing CSC as the leading developer, owner and manager of
preeminent U.K. regional shopping centre destinations,” CSC
Chief Executive Officer  David Fischel  said in the statement.  The sale marks the first time full ownership of one of the
U.K.’s 10 biggest malls will change hands since 1999. CSC will
own five of them when it completes the acquisition of Trafford.
Its existing malls include the largest, MetroCentre in northeast
England, and one in Manchester.  Request for Delay  CSC said it will sell the equivalent of as much as 9.9
percent of its equity to investors to help with financing. In a
letter the company received yesterday, Simon Property asked CSC
to delay the acquisition and the share sale to give it time to
prepare a potential offer, which would be higher than CSC’s net
asset value. The letter from Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner,
was cited in a separate CSC statement.  CSC  climbed as much as 15 percent, the most since September
2008, and was up 8.3 percent at 365.5 pence at 9:50 a.m., the
biggest gain among stocks in the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index . CSC’s
net asset value was 368 pence a share at June 30.  John Whittaker , Peel’s billionaire owner, will become a
non-executive director and deputy chairman of CSC under the
terms of the transaction, which will give Peel a stake of at
least 19.9 percent and make it the largest investor.  Peel will receive as many as 167.3 million new CSC shares
and up to 209 million pounds of convertible bonds paying a
coupon of 4.076 percent. Converting all the bonds would give it
a stake of 24.9 percent.  Trafford has 1.9 million square feet (176,500 square
meters) of retail space and attracts 35 million visitors a year.  British Land Co. bought the Meadowhall shopping center in
northern England in November 1999 for 1.17 billion pounds in
cash and assumed debt. It sold a 50 percent stake in February
last year for 588 million pounds, of which 170 million pounds
was cash.  Les Morris , a spokesman for Simon Property, said he had no
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
