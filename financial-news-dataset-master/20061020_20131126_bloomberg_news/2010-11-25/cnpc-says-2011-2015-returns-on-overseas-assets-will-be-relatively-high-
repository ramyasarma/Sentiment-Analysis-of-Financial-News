China National Petroleum Corp. said
returns on overseas investments in 2011 to 2015 will be
“relatively high,” according to a company on-line newsletter.
Spending on overseas oil and gas projects during this period
will be slower than initially planned, CNPC said. No figures
were given in the newsletter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
