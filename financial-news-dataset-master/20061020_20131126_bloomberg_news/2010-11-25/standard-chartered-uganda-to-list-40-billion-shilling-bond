Standard Chartered Plc ’s Ugandan
unit will begin trading a 40 billion-shilling ($17.5 million),
10-year bond on the Uganda Securities Exchange following
approval by the Capital Markets Authority.  The bank will begin issuance of the debt “with a selection
of investors” on Dec. 2, before secondary trading begins subject
to approval by the domestic bourse, the Kampala-based lender
said in a statement in the New Vision newspaper today.  Standard Chartered Bank Uganda Managing Director Lamin
Kemba Manjang said he would provide further details later today
when Bloomberg contacted him seeking comment.  The lender began trading a 10-year, 2 billion-shilling bond
on the exchange in May 2006, according to the bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
