Nickel may gain as much as 11
percent after halting declines at a trend line, before the rally
stalls at $25,000 a metric ton, according to technical analysis
by Commerzbank AG.  The attached chart shows the metal steadied after sliding
to a 20-month trend line. The second chart shows prices may
climb to $25,000, around the 2007 lows and near a 38.2 percent
retracement of the 2007-2008 decline, one of the levels singled
out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  “While we must allow for a rebound from here, we look for
rallies to remain capped by the $25,000 resistance,”
Commerzbank technical analyst  Karen Jones  said in a report
yesterday. “This is tough resistance, and we continue to look
for failure here.”  Nickel  for three-month delivery was at $22,440 a ton at
6:15 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange, taking this year’s gain
to 21 percent. It’s the second-best performer in 2010 of the six
main industrial metals traded on the LME, lagging only tin.
About two-thirds of nickel production is used to make stainless
steel resistant to corrosion.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
