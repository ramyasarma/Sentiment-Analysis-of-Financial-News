Dubai  oil, a Persian Gulf benchmark
for Asia, will sell at a narrower discount to Oman crude futures
in February than in January as the emirate increased its formula
price for the first time in five months.  The official selling price for Dubai crude loading in
February will be set at a discount of 10 cents to the Oman
futures contract for that month, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Department of Petroleum Affairs. The
discount narrowed from 20 cents, the level at which it had been
since September. The increase is the fifth this year.  The Oman futures contract is the only product traded on the
 Dubai Mercantile Exchange , which released the price differential
provided by the department.  The final February price will be calculated on the last day
of trading for that month’s contract on the DME, when the Oman
level is set. Oman crude for January delivery rose $1.88 a
barrel to $83.39, according to today’s settlement price from the
 DME .  Dubai’s Department of Petroleum Affairs usually issues the
price formula for its crude on the last Thursday of every month
to apply to the closing three months ahead. The DME’s futures
contract also sets the price for Oman’s more than 800,000
barrels a day of production.  Oman and Dubai are the only government entities to price
their oil based on the exchange-generated price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
