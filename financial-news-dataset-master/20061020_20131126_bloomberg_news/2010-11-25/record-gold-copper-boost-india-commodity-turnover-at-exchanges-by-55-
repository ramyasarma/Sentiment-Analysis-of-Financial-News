Turnover on commodity exchanges in
India, the top gold user and the second-largest wheat and rice
grower, surged 55 percent after bullion reached a record and
prices of farm goods climbed, the market regulator said.  The value of goods traded on the  Multi Commodity Exchange
of India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest, and 20 others jumped to
67.1 trillion rupees ($1.47 trillion) between April 1 and Nov.
15 from 43.2 trillion rupees a year earlier, the  Forward Markets
Commission  said on its website today.  Commodities have jumped this year on increased demand as
the U.S. emerged from recession and China, the world’s largest
metals user, led economic growth in Asia. Gold, which reached a
record $1,424.60 an ounce on Nov. 9, has gained 25 percent this
year, while silver has jumped 63 percent.  Gold and silver worth 30.1 trillion rupees were traded on
Indian bourses this financial year, 85 percent more than a year
earlier, the commission said. Turnover of base metals including
copper and zinc jumped 66 percent to 16 trillion rupees, it
said. Trading in wheat, soybean and other agricultural
commodities rose 12 percent to 7.71 trillion rupees in the year
starting April 1, the regulator said.  Copper, used in pipes and wires, reached an all-time high
in London this month. Grains and soybeans have rallied on higher
demand, trade curbs and poor harvests.  The trading value of commodities on Indian exchanges may
exceed 100 trillion rupees in the year to March 31, from 77.65
trillion rupees a year ago,  B.C. Khatua , chairman of the
commission said in August. Turnover on Indian commodity bourses
has surged 120 times after electronic trading was introduced in
2003, according to the regulator.  Domestic traders, producers and consuming companies are the
main participants in India’s 22 commodity exchanges. Overseas
investors aren’t allowed to buy and sell commodity futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
