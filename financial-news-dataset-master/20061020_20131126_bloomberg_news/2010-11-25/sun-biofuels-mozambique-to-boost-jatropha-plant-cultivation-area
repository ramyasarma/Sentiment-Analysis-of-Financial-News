Sun Biofuels Mozambique, a
subsidiary of U.K.-based Sun Biofuels Ltd., will increase
cultivation of jatropha plants by more than five times in as
many years, said  Sergio Gouveia , the company’s business
development manager.  “Our aim is to go to 11,000 hectares (27,170 acres) in
central Manica and Sofala provinces in five years,” Gouveia
said today in an interview in the central Chimoio town, north of
the capital, Maputo. The company currently sows the plants, used
to make biofuels, on 2,000 hectares. “We will follow the
pattern of land zoning approved by the government so that we do
not affect food productions.”  The company will sell oil from the plants to state-run
 Petroleos de Mocambique SA , he said.  Sun Biofuels Mozambique employs 1,200 people and is
considering buying jatropha from local farmers after it has
completed research, Gouveia said. “We don’t want to bring
farmers on board before we have a clear project, but we might
start within a year,” he added.  Some 20 hectares of the area under plantation are set aside
for research, and the company has planted six varieties from
which it will choose the most suitable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
