South Africa may need to build five
nuclear power plants by 2030 at a cost of more than $35 billion
as Africa’s biggest economy struggles to meet energy demand,
said  Rob Adam , chief executive officer of the country’s state-
owned  Nuclear Energy Corp .  Construction of the first plant should ideally start in
2013, Adam said in an interview in Johannesburg today. Plants
could be situated in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces.  “The country will need to build about five Koeberg-sized
stations,” he said. Koeberg, which started operating in 1984,
is the nation’s only nuclear plant and generates about 6 percent
of its electricity.  South Africa is battling an electricity shortage after the
government suspended the expansion plans of state-owned utility
Eskom Holdings Ltd. while it tried and failed to convince
private companies to build power plants. That resulted in a
five-day shutdown of most mines in the country, which is the
world’s biggest platinum producer, in early 2008.  In December of that year, South Africa halted plans to
build a second, 120 billion-rand ($17 billion) nuclear plant as
the global financial crisis tightened credit markets.  South Africa will complete laws next year to allow private
companies to invest in planned nuclear plants, Chris Forlee,
deputy director general of the Department of Public Enterprises,
said on Oct. 26.  Toshiba Corp.’s Westinghouse Electric Co. and  Areva SA , the
world’s largest supplier of reactors, vied for the canceled
order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
