Oil rose to its highest in more than
a week, extending yesterday’s gains as traders bet a larger-
than-forecast decline in U.S. jobless claims signaled economic
growth is accelerating in the  biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures surged the most in four months yesterday after the
Labor Department said applications for unemployment benefits
fell to the lowest level since 2008 in the week ended Nov. 20.
Oil prices at $100 a barrel would be “comfortable” for
producing countries because they offset rising food costs, said
Shokri Ghanem, chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp.  “Oil has established a new trading range between $82.50
and $89.50 as the demand side gets a little stronger,” said
 Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in
London. “A lot of the strength today can be attributed to
short-covering before the U.S. holiday.”  Crude for January delivery rose as much as 67 cents, or 0.8
percent, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange to $84.53 a barrel, the highest price since Nov. 16.
The contract was at $84.25 at 5:59 p.m. London time. Brent crude
for January settlement was up 25 cents at $86.09 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after rising to $86.50.  Yesterday, crude in New York advanced $2.61, or 3.2
percent, to $83.86 a barrel, the highest settlement since Nov.
15. Brent gained 3.1 percent to $85.84  Floor trading in New York will be halted today for the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday. Electronic deals will continue with Nov.
26 as the closing date for all transactions.  Backwardation Likely  Demand for  distillates  including diesel was 3.9 percent
higher in the week ended Nov. 19 compared with a year ago, the
Energy Department said yesterday.  Oil markets are poised to enter backwardation, with prompt-
delivery prices higher than those for later supply, as demand
for crude increases, according to Barclays Plc.  “Global spare crude capacity has fallen this year and is
likely to end the year at only a little above 5 percent,” a
team led by  Paul Horsnell , head of commodities research at
Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a report dated yesterday.
“We expect a more volatile and backwardated market to emerge
rapidly.”  Crude supplies  rose  1.03 million barrels to 358.6 million
in the week ended Nov. 19, according to the Energy Department
report. A 2 million-barrel decrease was  forecast , according to
the median of 16 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Distillate fuel  supplies, including diesel and kerosene,
dropped for a ninth week, declining 541,000 barrels to 158.3
million, the Energy Department said.  Gasoline  stockpiles climbed
1.9 million barrels to 209.6 million, the first gain in five
weeks.  “The past month has seen the overhang in U.S. diesel
supplies progressively come down on a combination of exports and
improved freight demand lifting diesel consumption,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP
Paribas SA, said in a note yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
