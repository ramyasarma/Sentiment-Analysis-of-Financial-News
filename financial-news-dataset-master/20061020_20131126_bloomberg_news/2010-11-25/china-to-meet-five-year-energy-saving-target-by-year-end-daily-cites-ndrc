China will likely meet its five-year
energy-reduction targets by the end of the year after energy
consumption per unit of gross domestic product declined by 3
percent in the first three quarters on a year earlier, China
Daily cited Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National
Development and Reform Commission, as saying.  Stricter measures to cut energy use and emmissions would be
part of the Asian country’s next five-year plan, Xie said,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
