Brazilian yields on interest-rate
futures contracts due in 2013 and after fell for a third day on
bets the new central bank president will take measures to curb
inflation when he takes office next year.  The yield on the contract due January 2013 declined 7 basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 12.21 percent at 3 p.m. New
York time. The January 2014 yield retreated 11 basis points to
12.12 percent.  Alexandre Tombini  will replace  Henrique Meirelles  as
central bank president if confirmed by the Senate. Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  will cut spending and avoid new expenditures, while
Tombini said he will have autonomy to decide on rates and meet
inflation targets.  “The discourse is in the right direction,”  Marcelo Carvalho , head of Latin American research at Banco BNP Paribas
Brasil SA, said by telephone from Sao Paulo. “This now needs to
translate into actions.”  Traders are betting Tombini, who currently serves as a
central-bank board member, will raise the benchmark rate at
least 25 basis points to 11 percent in January, according to
interest-rate futures due that month. Rousseff takes over as
president of Latin America’s largest economy Jan. 1.  The real was unchanged at 1.7216 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on the story:
