Property made a firm offer to acquire all linked units in

in a statement.  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc  (CSO SJ), the U. K.’s
largest shopping-mall owner, jumped 2.61 rand, or 6.7 percent,
to 41.69 rand, after Simon Property Group Inc. said it was

value.  Remgro Ltd.  (REM SJ), an investment holding company, rose
1.67 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 109.87 rand. The company will

the company said on Nov. 9.  Vox Telecom Ltd.  (VOX SJ), an Internet service and software
company, declined for the second day in three, losing 3 cents,
or 7.1 percent, to 39 cents. Vox Telecom reported a loss of
678.7 million rand ($97 million) for the year through August,

One shares. In return, Atomredmetzoloto will pay $610 million in
