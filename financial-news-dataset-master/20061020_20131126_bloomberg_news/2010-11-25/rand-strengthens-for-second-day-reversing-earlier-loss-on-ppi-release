The rand pared earlier losses and
rose, heading for a second day of gains against the dollar.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy strengthened 0.3
percent to 7.0470 by 2:32 p.m. in Johannesburg from a close of
7.0664 yesterday.  Earlier, the rand weakened as much as 0.4 percent after a
report showed  producer prices  increased an annual 6.4 percent,
lower than both the 6.8 percent reported in September and the
6.8 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, leaving more room for the central bank to reduce interest
rates.  Money-market investors raised bets the central bank will
leave the benchmark rate unchanged at its next meeting in
January, forward-rate agreements showed. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in a month  climbed half a basis point to 5.52
percent.  Bonds declined, with the benchmark 13.5 percent government
security due September 2015 falling 8 cents to 125.03 rand,
raising the yield by 1.6 basis points to 7.224 percent. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
