Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. , India’s
second-biggest domestic carrier, said some reserve pilots had
left the company.  The departures won’t affect Kingfisher’s operations,
 Prakash Mirpuri , an airline spokesman, said in a phone interview
today. He declined to say how many pilots had left.  The Economic Times said earlier today that 50 pilots had
quit Bangalore-based Kingfisher to join Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
 Ragini Chopra , a spokeswoman for Jet, didn’t answer calls to her
cellphone. Mirpuri declined to say how many pilots Kingfisher
has in total.  Kingfisher’s board is also today due to consider a possible
sale of securities to help pare the carrier’s 77.2 billion-rupee
($1.7 billion) debt pile. The airline has already reduced its
fleet of leased planes, curbed the number of expatriate pilots
and appointed  Sanjay Aggarwal , formerly head of budget carrier
SpiceJet Ltd., as chief executive officer to help cut costs.  Kingfisher , backed by billionaire  Vijay Mallya , rose as
much as 2.7 percent to 73.4 rupees and changed hands at 69.85
rupees at 1.26 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock has gained 11 percent
this year.  The airline has a fleet of 66 planes, of which five are
grounded, Mirpuri said.  The carrier, which announced a  net loss  of 2.3 billion
rupees in the three months ended September, has won preliminary
backing to restructure debt from a group of lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
