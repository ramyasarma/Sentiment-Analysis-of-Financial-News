Standard Chartered Plc , the U.K.-
based bank that makes more than three-quarters of its profit in
Asia, said it won’t join any pact to restrain bonuses for 2010.  “We can confirm we are not part of any pact,” said
London-based spokesman  Jon Tracey  in a telephone interview
today. “It would be unfair to the vast majority of our staff to
curtail compensation arrangements.” About 97 percent of the
bank’s 85,000 employees work outside the U.K., he added.  Barclays Plc,  HSBC Holdings Plc,  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  and Standard Chartered Plc are in talks about a
possible pact to cut bonus payments and increase lending to
small businesses, the London Times reported today without
attribution. The banks aim to issue a joint statement signed by
their chief executive officers before Christmas, the newspaper
said.  Officials at RBS and Barclays declined to comment. A
spokesperson for HSBC wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Talks between the banks have been taking place, said two
people with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
