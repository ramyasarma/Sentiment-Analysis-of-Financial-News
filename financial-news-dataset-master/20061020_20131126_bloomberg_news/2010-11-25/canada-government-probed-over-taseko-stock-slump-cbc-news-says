Canadian securities watchdogs are
investigating the possibility that a 40 percent plunge in the
shares of Taseko Mines Ltd. on Oct. 14 was caused by a leak of
confidential information from inside the federal government, CBC
News reported on its website.  On Nov. 2, the government said it was blocking Taseko’s
planned development of a copper and gold mine in British
Columbia.  Federal officials told CBC News on condition of anonymity
that the share slump caused “panic” in the ministerial offices
involved in reviewing the mine question, because of concern that
the as yet unannounced decision had been leaked.  Taseko issued a statement on Oct. 14 saying it was unaware
of any information that would cause its share price to change,
after which its share price recovered a little; when the
government announced its blocking decision 19 days later, the
shares declined again, to almost exactly the same low as on Oct.
14, the broadcaster said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
