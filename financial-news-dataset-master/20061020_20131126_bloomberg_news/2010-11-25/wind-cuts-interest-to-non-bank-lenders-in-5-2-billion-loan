Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA
reduced the interest rate it will pay to non-bank lenders
joining its 3.93 billion-euro ($5.24 billion) loan, according to
a person familiar with the deal.  Interest on Wind’s 2 billion-euro seven-year term loan B
was cut by 25 basis points to 425 basis points over benchmark
rates, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the loan is private. The Rome-based company will offer a portion
of the loan at 99.5 percent of face value from a previously
indicated price of 99, said the person.  Wind, the Italian mobile-phone operator owned by
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , is raising the new loans to
refinance debt as parent Weather Investments SpA prepares to
merge with Russia’s VimpelCom Ltd.  A spokeswoman for Wind Telecom who didn’t want to be
identified declined to comment.  Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Banca IMI SpA,
BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole SA, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase &
Co, Morgan Stanley, Natixis and UniCredit SpA are underwriting
the loan. WestLB AG joined as an arranger.  To contact the reporters on this story:
