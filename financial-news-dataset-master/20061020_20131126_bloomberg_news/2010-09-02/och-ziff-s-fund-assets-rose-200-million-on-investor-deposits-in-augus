Och-Ziff Capital Management Group
LLC , the New York-based hedge-fund firm run by  Daniel Och , said
assets under management rose 1 percent last month as the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 8.8 percent for the biggest
September advance since 1939.  Holdings increased $200 million to $26.3 billion as of Oct.
1, the firm said in a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The OZ Master Fund, Och-Ziff’s main fund,
increased 1.3 percent for a gain of 4.2 percent this year.  During the month, the U.S. government said the economy grew
at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, faster than
the 1.6 percent previously estimated. Initial jobless claims
decreased by 16,000 to 453,000 in the week ended Sept. 25, fewer
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Och-Ziff’s Asia Master fund rose 1.6 percent in September
for a year-to-date gain of 5.3 percent. The Europe Master Fund
advanced 1.8 percent last month for a 5 percent increase this
year, according to the filing.  The firm was started in 1994 by former  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.  trader Och, 49, and Ziff Brothers Investments LLC with
money from the Ziff media empire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
