PAI Partners, the manager of a 2.7
billion-euro ($3.6 billion) leveraged buyout fund, plans to sell
French insurance broker Compagnie Europeenne de Prevoyance early
next year, four people with knowledge of the talks said.  The private equity firm is preparing to seek bids and is
asking lenders to draw up a debt financing package for potential
bidders, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the talks are private. The broker, which may attract bids from
private equity firms as well as other banks and insurers, may
fetch as much as 1 billion euros, one of the people said.  Leveraged buyout firms such as Paris-based PAI pool money
from investors to take over companies, financing their purchases
mostly with debt, with the intention of selling them later for a
profit. The firms are resuming asset sales after the credit
crisis brought deal-making to a near halt. Firms have led $227
billion of takeovers in 2010, more than double the amount in the
same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PAI has reaped about eight times its original investment in
CEP in 2005 through debt-financed dividend payments, one of the
people said. A spokesman for PAI in Paris couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
