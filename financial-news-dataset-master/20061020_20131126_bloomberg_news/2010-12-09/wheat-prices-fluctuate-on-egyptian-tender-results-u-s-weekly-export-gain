Wheat futures fluctuated after Egypt,
the world’s biggest buyer, shunned supplies from the U.S., which
reported a weekly gain in overseas sales.  Today, Egypt bought 240,000 tons from France and Argentina
in a tender. Export sales from the U.S., the leading shipper,
climbed to 726,510 metric tons in the week ended Dec. 2, up 3.2
percent from a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said.  “We have picked up the entire amount of Egypt’s last two
tenders, so this is a disappointment now,” said  Rich Nelson ,
the director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois.
“What Egypt needs is milling-quality wheat. I’m not sure how
much of that is left in France, but maybe they did feel the
newly harvested crops were coming off OK in Argentina.”  Wheat futures for March delivery rose fell 1 cent to $7.83
a bushel at 11:31 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier,
the price climbed as much as 0.8 percent and dropped as much as
0.5 percent. Before today, the most-active contract surged 63
percent since the end of June as global supplies tightened.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
