Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  called on bankers to “reflect” on the hardship endured
by many people as they struggle with unemployment and a weak
U.K. economy before they award themselves large bonuses.  Banks should “reflect upon the situation that this economy
is in,” Osborne told reporters in London today. “Look around
you at the world you live in.”  His comments come on the same day the U.K. government said
it will tax banks’  balance sheets  at a higher rate than first
proposed, raising almost 9 billion pounds ($14 billion) over the
next four years.  Business Secretary  Vince Cable , who’s warned that large
bank bonus payments at a time of national austerity will be a
“provocation,” has said he’s examining whether to force listed
companies to reveal the pay of high earners.  Osborne also said today he fully supports Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King , after the WikiLeaks website published a
leaked U.S. diplomatic cable suggesting King had questioned the
experience of Osborne and Prime Minister  David Cameron  when they
were in opposition.  He also defended King’s right to express his views on
fiscal policy, rejecting criticism that the governor is
interfering in political decision-making.  “The governor of the Bank of England has behaved very
well,” Osborne said. “He’s under constant pressure to be drawn
into the political debate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
