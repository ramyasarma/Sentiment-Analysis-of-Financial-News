American International Group Inc. ,
once the world’s largest insurer, struck a deal to repay the
 Federal Reserve  as the company works toward independence, less
than two years after the bailed-out firm’s then-leader said the
AIG name was “disgraced.”  “This company is not going away, it’s here to stay,”
 Robert Haines , an analyst at CreditSights Inc., said in an
interview yesterday after the insurer announced the agreement.
“There’s a lot of interest in AIG again, and AIG as a
franchise.” The following is a timeline of the rescue of New
York-based AIG and the company’s efforts to repay taxpayers.  Sept. 16, 2008: The U.S. agrees to loan AIG as much as $85
billion in exchange for a stake of almost 80 percent after
 credit downgrades  force the insurer to post collateral to banks
that purchased derivatives from the company.  Sept. 18, 2008: AIG’s board approves  Edward Liddy , who ran
Allstate Corp. from 1999 to 2006, as chief executive officer.
The two-year credit line is “enough” for AIG, Liddy says.  Oct. 8, 2008: Liddy gets an expanded bailout from the government
with authorization for an additional $37.8 billion in liquidity
as AIG struggles to meet the demands of clients pulling out of
its securities-lending program.  Oct. 22, 2008: Liddy tells PBS that the $122.8 billion offered
by the government “may not be enough” to stabilize AIG.  Nov. 10, 2008: Treasury commits to a $40 billion investment, and
New York Fed agrees to spend as much as $52.5 billion to buy
mortgage-related securities owned or backed by the insurer as
losses tied to housing best mount. The credit line is cut to $60
billion and AIG wins a lower interest rate and three extra years
to pay back the loan. The $37.8 billion facility is canceled.  March 2, 2009: AIG reports a record $61.7 billion fourth-quarter
loss and gets an additional Treasury injection of as much as
$29.8 billion, raising the bailout total to about $182.3
billion. “Liquidity is not an issue for us now,” Liddy says.  March 3, 2009: Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  says AIG
operated like a hedge fund and having to rescue the insurer made
him “more angry” than any other episode in the credit crisis.  March 18, 2009: “The AIG name is so thoroughly wounded and
disgraced that we’re probably going to have to change it,”
Liddy tells Congress.  Aug 3, 2009: AIG’s board elects ex-MetLife Inc. leader  Robert Benmosche  as CEO.  Dec. 1, 2009: The Fed reduces AIG’s credit-line debt by $25
billion in anticipation of receiving proceeds from the eventual
sale of two non-U.S. life divisions, American Life Insurance Co.
and AIA Group Ltd.  Jan. 27, 2010: Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  says the
AIG bailout prevented an “utter collapse” of the U.S. economy.
Had AIG failed, “thousands of factories would have closed their
doors,” Geithner tells a congressional panel. “Millions more
would have lost their jobs. People would have rushed to take
their savings out of banks.”  April 12, 2010: Fairholme Capital Management, led by  Bruce Berkowitz , says it acquired about 15 million shares of AIG,
gaining the second-largest holding in the company.  July 14, 2010: Chairman  Harvey Golub  steps down after feuding
with Benmosche over the stalled divestiture of AIA. He is
replaced by  Steve Miller , an AIG director.  Aug. 6, 2010: Benmosche says in a memo to staff that AIG is in
talks with U.S. regulators about “a complete government exit.”  Aug. 11, 2010: AIG agrees to sell a majority stake in its
consumer lender to  Fortress Investment Group LLC,  getting rid of
a unit that accumulated more than $17 billion in debt.  Aug. 25, 2010: AIG’s  draw on the credit line  falls to the lowest
since the bailout after the  plane-leasing unit  raises about  $4.4
billion  in bond sales to private investors earlier in the month.  Sept. 30, 2010: AIG says it will convert Treasury’s preferred
stake of about $49.1 billion to common shares for sale to
private investors. Geithner says “we are much closer to seeing
a clear path out.”  Oct. 28, 2010: AIG  sells  a majority stake in AIA in an initial
public offering in Hong Kong, raising $20.5 billion.  Nov. 1, 2010: MetLife  purchases  Alico for $16.2 billion.  Nov. 30, 2010: AIG sells $2 billion of bonds in its first
offering since the bailout in 2008.  Dec. 8, 2010: AIG agrees to repay a Federal Reserve credit line,
on which it owes about $21 billion, using proceeds from the
Alico and AIA sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
