Economic data suggest that a 1
percentage point increase in China’s  growth rate  sustained over
five years means an extra 0.4 percentage point of growth for the
rest of the world, two experts at the International Monetary
Fund said after studying figures for the past two decades.  “Analysis of a longer time period -- 1963-2007 -- suggests
that the spillover effect of China’s growth has increased over
time. Geographic distance seems to affect the strength of the
spillover effects, with a stronger impact the closer a country
is to China,” Vivek Arora and Athanasios Vamvakidis wrote in
the IMF’s Finance and Development magazine December issue. “But
the estimates also suggest that the role of distance has
diminished over time.”  The pace of economic growth in China has an impact on the
rest of the world, first through  trade  channels and then through
capital flows, tourism and business confidence, the two authors
said. The magazine was posted on the IMF website today.  “A few decades ago, China’s expansion influenced growth
only in neighboring countries; it now affects growth all over
the world,” the two IMF experts wrote. The size of the impact
“has increased from negligible levels until about two decades
ago to a sizeable impact more recently.”  China’s economic growth slowed to a 9.6 percent annual pace
in the  third quarter  from 11.9 percent in the first three months
of this year. Even as the expansion moderates, China is set to
overtake Japan this year to become the world’s second-biggest
economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
