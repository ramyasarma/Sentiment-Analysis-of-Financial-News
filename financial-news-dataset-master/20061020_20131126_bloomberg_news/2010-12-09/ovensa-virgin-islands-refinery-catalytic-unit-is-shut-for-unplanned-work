Hovensa LLC shut the fluid catalytic
cracker at its Saint Croix refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands
for repairs,  Alex Moorhead , a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  The unit will be restarted as soon as repairs are
completed, he said, declining to comment on when the outage
occurred.  The 525,000-barrrel-a-day  plant  also reported today a
release of steam containing a hydrocarbon mix from the plant,
Mark Walters, director of Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency
Management, said in a telephone interview.  “Hovensa itself is saying they had a minor impact from the
release near the coker plant,” he said. The release was
reported as of 7:30 a.m. local time, according to Walters.  The refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker has a capacity of
150,000 barrels a day. Hovensa is a joint venture of state oil
company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  and  Hess Corp.   The refinery receives and processes crude oil from around
the world via tankers and sends finished products to the U.S. In
September, the U.S. received 142,000 barrels a day of gasoline
and 64,000 barrels a day of distillate fuels, including heating
oil and diesel, from the plant, according to Energy Department
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
