House Democrats approved a resolution
to block a floor debate on the tax agreement between President
Barack Obama and congressional Republicans, Representative Peter
DeFazio of Oregon said.  The resolution, which is non-binding, was approved by
voice vote, he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed no
opposition, DeFazio said. DeFazio said the vote would give
Democratic leaders license to force the Senate and White
House back to the bargaining table.  To contact the reporter on this story:
