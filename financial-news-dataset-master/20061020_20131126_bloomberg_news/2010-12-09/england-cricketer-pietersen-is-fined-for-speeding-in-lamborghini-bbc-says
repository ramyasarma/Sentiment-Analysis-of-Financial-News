England cricketer Kevin Pietersen,
named man of the match in the Adelaide victory over Australia in
the second Test of the Ashes series, was stopped and fined for
speeding, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported, citing
police.  Pietersen, who hit a career-best 227 and took one wicket,
was driving at 123 kilometers an hour in a 100 kph zone on the
Great Ocean Highway near Melbourne in a bright yellow
Lamborghini Gallardo sports car when he was snapped by a laser
speed gun, the broadcaster said.  Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne had arranged the
drive, which ended with Pietersen being fined A$239 ($236);
England’s tour management said he wouldn’t face disciplinary
proceedings, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
