Copper prices fell from a 31-month
high in New York on speculation that China, the world’s biggest
metal consumer, may raise interest rates to slow economic growth
and inflation.  China advanced the release of November economic figures to
Dec. 11 from Dec. 13, fueling speculation that the central bank
may raise borrowing costs for the second time in two months.
Earlier, copper reached $4.1545 a pound, the highest since May
2008, amid shrinking inventories and increasing investor demand
before the introduction of funds backed by physical metal.  “Commodity prices will be adversely affected” by a rate
increase in China,  Alex Heath , the head of industrial-metal
trading at Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in London, said in a
report.  Copper futures for March delivery slipped 1.35 cents, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $4.087 at 1:19 p.m. on the Comex in
New York, halting an eight-session rally of 9 percent. Since
July 1, the price has jumped 42 percent.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $65, or 0.7 percent, to $8,950 a metric ton ($4.06 a
pound). Earlier, the price rose to a record $9,091.  Copper on the LME will top $10,000 in 2011 on
“extraordinarily tight” supplies,  Kevin Norrish , a managing
director at Barclays Capital, said today at a press conference
in New York. Global inventories will touch an all-time low as
demand rises “rapidly” in China and India, driven by
construction of infrastructure and homes, he said.  Aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead also fell in London. Tin
gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
