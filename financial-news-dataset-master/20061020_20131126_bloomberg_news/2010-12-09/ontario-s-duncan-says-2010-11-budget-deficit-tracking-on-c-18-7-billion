Ontario’s Finance Minister Dwight
Duncan said the province’s deficit for the 2010-11 fiscal year
was “tracking” C$18.7 billion ($18.6 billion).  Duncan, who was speaking in New York, also said Chinese
banks were buying the province’s bonds, which helps to give
Ontario a more diverse source of funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
