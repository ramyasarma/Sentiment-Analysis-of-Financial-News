Treasuries rebounded after an almost
six-month high for 10-year yields attracted investors, while
most U.S. stocks rose as the manager of the world’s largest bond
fund increased its estimate for economic growth because of
government stimulus efforts.  The 10-year  Treasury yield  slipped five basis points to
3.22 percent at 4 p.m. in New York, extending declines after
stronger-than-estimated demand at an auction of 30-year debt.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 1,233.00 and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent, with both
closing at the highest levels since September 2008. Gold halted
a two-day slide, while copper slipped from a 31-month high. The
Dollar Index pared an early rally and was little changed at 80.  Treasuries slid in the previous two sessions, sending the
10-year yield to its biggest back-to-back increase in more than
two years, amid speculation President  Barack Obama ’s compromise
to extend tax cuts will require an increase in government
borrowing. U.S. equities fluctuated for much of today amid
concern House Democrats will block the tax-cut extension before
stocks extended gains as Pacific Investment Management Co. said
a “massive amount” of stimulus will boost economic growth.  “The bulls are winning,” said  Philip Orlando , the New York-
based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which manages $341.3 billion. “Some of the folks who had
been bearish are throwing in the towel here and realizing that
they need to get themselves invested. Investors are starting to
recognize that the stimulus measures are generating economic
growth.”  30-Year Treasury Auction  The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond lost five basis
points to 4.41 percent after rates near a seven-month high
bolstered demand at the auction of $13 billion in the debt.  The bonds drew a yield of 4.410 percent at today’s auction,
compared with the average forecast of 4.477 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 7 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 2.74, the highest since the
Aug. 12 sale.  U.S. debt briefly pared its gains after the Federal Reserve
purchased fewer seven-year notes today under its program of
quantitative easing than some investors expected. The central
bank bought $8.309 billion of Treasuries maturing from November
2016 to November 2017. The Fed had said it would consider
purchases of $7 billion to $9 billion of debt due from June 2016
to November 2017.  Fed Disapproval  A Bloomberg poll showed the majority of Americans are
dissatisfied with the Fed, saying the central bank should either
be brought under tighter political control or abolished
outright. The Bloomberg National Poll, conducted Dec. 4-7,
underlined the extent to which the central bank’s standing has
suffered as it comes under fire in Congress, first from
Democrats for regulatory lapses before the financial crisis and
then from Republicans for failing to revive an economy in which
the  jobless  rate hovers near 10 percent.  An early rally in stocks faded today as House Democrats
voted to block a floor debate on Obama’s tax deal with
Republicans, in a non-binding move to force changes in the
proposal to extend Bush-era tax cuts for all income levels.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told reporters
that members will make suggestions and “bring something to the
floor.”  ‘Another Catalyst’  “We obviously need more clarity on the tax-cut extension
plan,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based head of
investment strategy for scientific active equities at BlackRock
Inc., which oversees $3.45 trillion as the world’s largest asset
manager. “Once that happens, that should be another catalyst
for riskier assets.  The S&P 500 fluctuated for much of the day before extending
gains late in the session after Pimco Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed El-Erian said the firm was boosting its growth forecast.
Pimco sees the economy growing 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the
fourth quarter of next year from the same period of this year.
That compares with its previous estimate for 2 percent to 2.5
percent growth.  The MSCI World Index climbed 0.4 percent to a one-month
high. The early advance in global stocks came after U.S. jobless
claims fell more than estimated, Japan’s economy grew more than
the government initially estimated and Australian employers
added more than double the number of workers forecast by
economists.  Jobless Claims  Applications for jobless benefits decreased to 421,000,
compared with the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News for 425,000 new claims. Labor Department figures
showed. The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure,
dropped to the lowest level in more than two years.  Gains in the S&P 500 were led by financial companies as
Bank of America Corp. rallied 5.4 percent and Wells Fargo & Co.
climbed 2.4 percent.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 2.42 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 11,370.06. The 30-stock gauge was
dragged down as DuPont Co. slid 1.2 percent after the lower end
of its 2011 profit forecast trailed analysts’ projections and
McDonald’s Corp. dropped 1.4 percent after November comparable-
store sales trailed estimates.  Portugal, Spain Stocks  Portuguese and  Spanish  stock markets helped lead European
equities higher. Bank shares rallied, with  BNP Paribas SA ,
France’s largest lender, jumping 2.8 percent and  Barclays Plc 
climbing 4.5 percent.  ASML Holding NV  advanced 8 percent after
raising its forecast for orders in the fourth quarter.  Gains were limited by automakers after  Xiong Chuanlin , vice
secretary-general of the China Automobile Industry Association,
said in Beijing that the government may end tax incentives for
car purchases next year.  Volkswagen AG  and  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG  fell more than 2.7 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.8 percent. Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest publicly traded bank,
rose 3.7 percent, while Westpac Banking Group Ltd., Australia’s
second-largest bank by market value, climbed 2.4 percent.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  was little changed after a
1.4 percent loss yesterday, as South Korea’s  Kospi  rose 1.7
percent. The  Shanghai Composite Index  declined 1.3 percent to
the lowest level since Oct. 11 after the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences said property prices are inflated.  Euro Weakens  The euro depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.3243 and weakened
0.5 percent to 110.87 yen. Fitch cut Ireland’s long-term rating
to BBB+ from A+ today, reigniting concern about the euro
region’s most indebted nations. The extra yield investors demand
to hold Irish 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German bunds
 widened  two basis points to 503 basis points.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5766 after the Bank of
England kept the U.K.’s main interest rate at a record-low 0.5
percent and its bond-purchase program at 200 billion pounds
($315 billion).  Australia’s dollar strengthened against 14 of 16 major
peers, rising 0.5 percent to 98.42 U.S. cents to snap a three-
day decline.  Copper futures for March delivery slipped 1.35 cents, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $4.087 on the Comex in New York,
halting an eight-session rally of 9 percent. Since July 1, the
price has jumped 42 percent. Crude oil climbed 9 cents to $88.37
a barrel.  Rubber futures traded on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
gained as much as 1.4 percent to 382.5 yen per kilogram ($4,558
a ton), the highest since Nov. 11, when the most active contract
reached a 30-year high of 383 yen ($4.56). Rubber has risen 38
percent this year on prospects for a shortage after drought
followed by heavy rains disrupted production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
