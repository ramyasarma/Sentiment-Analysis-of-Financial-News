The U.K. and Ireland may have the
coldest December since 1890 and one of the snowiest three on
record, Jim Dale, a senior meteorologist at British Weather
Services in High Wycombe, England, said by e-mail.  “If you think the weather couldn’t get any worse, then
think again,” he said. “The outflow of frigid air from the
northeast is set to bring us all back into the deep freezer,
possibly for a lengthy period” as early as Dec. 14, he said.  Snowfall may be the heaviest recorded for December,
competing with 1981 and 1878, Dale said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
