U.S. technology companies are busy
enough to suggest a post-Internet bubble high in the Nasdaq-100
Index is coming soon, according to  Michael Shaoul , Oscar Gruss &
Son Inc.’s chief executive officer.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of the Tech
Pulse Index, an industry gauge compiled by the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, and the Nasdaq-100 in the past eight
years. Apple Inc. and other technology companies account for
more than half of the stock index’s value, according to data
from Bloomberg.  November’s  Tech Pulse  reading, released yesterday, was the
highest since February 2001. The index of business and consumer
demand for technology, along with industry production, shipments
and employment, rose 1 percent to 111.60. Last month’s increase
followed an October drop of 0.1 percent, the first in 20 months.  “The breakout of this metric above its 2007 peak supports
our belief” that the  Nasdaq-100  will follow suit,  Shaoul  wrote
today in an e-mail.  The Nasdaq-100’s close yesterday was 1.7 percent below a
high set on Oct. 31, 2007. The earlier peak was about half its
 record  in March 2000, when the Internet bubble that inflated in
the second half of the 1990s reached its high point.  Technology stocks would have to climb more for the Nasdaq
Composite Index to reach a post-bubble peak. Yesterday’s close
for the composite was 8.7 percent below its  high , set on the
same day as the Nasdaq-100’s.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
