Raw-sugar futures in New York fell
for the third time this week on concern that an import tax will
reduce demand from India, the world’s largest user. Cocoa and
coffee also dropped.  India will consider imposing a duty on sugar imports after
assessing the domestic production in the third week of December,
Farm Minister Sharad Pawar told reporters in New Delhi. Prices
have jumped 22 percent since the end of September as adverse
weather damaged global crops.  “Indian demand might be curbed because of higher costs
associated with sugar,” said  Phil Streible , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Maybe the
existing countries that have excess supplies are going to end up
getting stuck with it.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.27 cent, or 0.9
percent, to settle at 28.71 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. In London, refined-sugar futures for
March delivery declined $5.20, or 0.7 percent, to $727.20 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery slid $25, or 0.8 percent,
to $3,010 a ton on ICE. On NYSE Liffe, cocoa futures for March
delivery lost 17 pounds, or 0.8 percent, to 1,992 pounds
($3,136) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery declined 0.1 cent
to $2.0455 a pound on ICE. In London, robusta-coffee futures for
March delivery gained $22, or 1.2 percent, to $1,904 a ton.  Global coffee production will rise in the 2010-2011 season
to a record 139.4 million bags, up 12 percent from a year
earlier, German research company F.O. Licht said today in its
first estimate for the new crop. The 2010-2011 season started
Oct. 1 for most countries, while in Brazil it’s mostly over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
