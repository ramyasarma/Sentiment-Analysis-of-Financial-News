U.S. households’ municipal-debt
holdings fell a half percent in the third quarter, the first
decline in two years, as the recovering economy boosted the
allure of stocks.  State and local government debt owned by households, the
largest investor group, fell $5.7 billion to $1.06 trillion in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter,  data 
released today by the Federal Reserve said. It’s the first
decline since the third quarter of 2008. Holdings were 7.7
percent higher than in the third quarter of 2009, the Fed said.  Record-low tax-exempt yields and a  10.7 percent jump  in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index in the quarter may have
prompted households to shift funds, said  Howard Cure , director
of municipal research for Evercore Wealth Management LLC in New
York.  “It could just be people sensing the economy picking up,
making them less risk-adverse and switching from bonds to
equities,” he said.  The total municipal-bond market, including short- and long-
term debt that states and local governments sold for their own
purposes or for nonprofit, expanded by half a percent to $2.86
trillion during the third quarter from the second, the Fed data
show. The market was 3 percent larger than in the same period
last year, it said.  International holdings rose 1 percent in the quarter to $52
billion, the Fed data show. The amount is up 4 percent from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
