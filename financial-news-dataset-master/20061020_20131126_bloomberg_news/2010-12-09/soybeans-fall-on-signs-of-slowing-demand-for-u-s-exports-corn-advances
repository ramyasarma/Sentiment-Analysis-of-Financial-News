Soybean futures fell the most this
month after a government report showed declining demand for U.S.
exports. Corn prices also declined.  U.S. exporters sold 637,814 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended Dec. 2, less than half the week-earlier total and the
smallest amount since August, the Department of Agriculture said
today. Some processors in China, the biggest buyer, have halted
output as declining demand for feed and cooking oil eroded
profit, the National Grain & Oils Information Center said today.  “There’s a slowdown in demand for U.S. soybeans,” said
Bill Gentry, a broker at  Risk Management Commodities Inc . in
Lafayette, Indiana. “Chinese crushers may reduce purchases
because of the slowdown in demand for soybean meal.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 14.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to close at $12.815 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest decline since Nov. 26.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.25 cent to settle at
$5.7425 a bushel in Chicago, after slipping as much as 0.9
percent.  Trading was reduced before the USDA’s monthly crop report
tomorrow, Gentry said.  Traders expect the USDA to reduce its forecasts for U.S.
and world reserve inventories, Gentry said. “We remain bullish
on the corn-price outlook and have recommended end-users add to
purchases” because inventories are expected to decline to the
lowest since 1996, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
