Robert Rauschenberg ’s 1962 “Aen
Floga (Combine Painting)” is a white canvas outfitted with
rusty wire and beat-up scraps of wood and metal. Even after half
a century, the work looks radical.  Gagosion gallery represents the artist’s estate, and it’s
the first work you see at the current retrospective, which is
bursting with 49 raw, amusing and messy pieces.  Rauschenberg, who died two years ago, was the master of
combines and collaging, and could pull off the most bizarre
compositions using rags, tires or old furniture.  It’s hard to imagine the popular wave of “assemblage”
without Rauschenberg’s stack of cardboard boxes impaled by a
wooden branch kebab-style in 1973’s “Untitled” (Venetian).  Compared to some of his peers, Rauschenberg remains
undervalued, though no doubt Gagosian will be working hard to
change that.  In 2008, “Overdrive,” his 1962 oil and silkscreen on
canvas fetched a record $14.6 million at Sotheby’s in New York.
That’s $14 million less than the auction record of  Jasper Johns ,
Rauschenberg’s friend and contemporary.  The gallery declined to reveal prices for available works.
Rauschenberg’s digital collages shown at the Pace gallery in
2008 cost $400,000 each.  “Robert Rauschenberg” runs through Jan. 15 at 522 W. 21st
St. Information: +1-212-741-1717;  http://www.gagosian.com .  Corporate Takeover  Belgian painter  Luc Tuymans , who last cast a baleful eye on
 Disney , has a bigger target in “Corporate,” the group of 11
new works on view at  David Zwirner  gallery.  A striking image of a galleon floating on still water, its
sails paradoxically swaying in the wind, opens the show. Painted
in ominous shades of gray and purple, the vessel looks headed
for disaster.  “Anonymous” is a portrait of a man with a dark
featureless mass instead of a face. In “Panel,” the speakers
look like overexposed photographs, white, washed-out and
unidentifiable. The corporate effect on modern life is clearly
not a happy one.  Prices range from $600,000 to $1.2 million, and all works
have been sold.  “Luc Tuymans: Corporate” runs through Dec. 21 at 525 W.

Marks , ribbons of color snake and entwine with meditative
musicality.  The palette of pale grays, greens, blues and yellows is
occasionally interrupted by bursts of terracotta red, earthy
orange or dark blue. The landscapes are framed by vertical
monochrome bands running to the right and the left.  Slowly, the history of each painting’s creation unfolds as
your eyes adjust to the subtle color transitions and ghostlike
layers emerge beneath the surface.  The exhibition also includes 13 virtuosic works on paper.  All have been sold. The gallery declined to reveal the
prices. An auction record for Marden’s painting is $9.6 million;
the top price for his work on paper is $2 million.  “Brice Marden: Letters” runs through Dec. 23 at 522 W.
