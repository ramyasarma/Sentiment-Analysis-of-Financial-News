iStar Financial Inc. , the commercial
real-estate lender seeking to avert a bankruptcy filing next
year, received money from a debt recapitalization by the 46-
story Trump SoHo hotel and condominium in New York.  iStar has been “substantially paid down and all project
indebtedness has been extended as a result of new debt financing
provided by CIM Group LLC,” Trump SoHo developers Bayrock Group
LLC and Sapir Organization said in an e-mailed statement,
without providing further financial information.  iStar may refinance its loans with a new $1 billion to $2
billion credit line as an alternative to seeking bankruptcy
protection, three people with direct knowledge of the matter
said on Nov. 11. The New York-based company had about $2.8
billion of non-performing loans as of Sept. 30.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editors:  Will McSheehy ,  Ed Johnson   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
