The African Union called for Ivory
Coast’s  Laurent Gbagbo  to hand over power to rival  Alassane Ouattara  and suspended the country from the bloc following a
disputed presidential election Nov. 28.  The AU “strongly urges Mr. Laurent Gbagbo to respect the
results of the election and to facilitate, without delay, the
transfer of power” to Ouattara, according to e-mailed statement
after a meeting of the body’s Peace and Security Council.  Ouattara’s win, as announced by the country’s electoral
commission Dec. 2, was annulled by the Constitutional Council
over claims of irregularities in the northern regions. The
council named Gbagbo as the winner.  The Addis Ababa-based AU follows the Economic Community of
West African States in sanctioning the world’s top cocoa
producer. The United Nations, the European Union, the U.S. and
France have all called for Gbagbo, who has ruled for a decade,
to cede power to former prime minister Ouattara.  Gbagbo and Ouattara have both taken presidential oaths of
office, appointed prime ministers and cabinets in the stalemate.  The decision to suspend the country doesn’t mean the union
is “closing the doors” on dialogue with the leaders, said
Noureddine Mezni, a spokesman for AU Commission Chairman  Jean Ping , in a phone interview. On Dec. 5, former South African
President  Thabo Mbeki  traveled to Ivory Coast for talks with
both Gbagbo and Ouattara at the AU’s request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
