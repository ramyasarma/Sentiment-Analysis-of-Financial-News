Tin is likely to outperform other
base metals as demand growth outpaces production, widening a
deficit through next year, according to an analyst with Standard
Chartered Bank.  “Going forward, we expect global tin demand to continue to
pick up from here,”  Judy Zhu , a commodity analyst based in
Shanghai, said at a seminar in Seoul. “We’d expect the tin
market’s deficit to expand. We are bullish on tin and expect it
to outperform the rest of base metals.”  Mine output will continue to be limited, with the
production outlook for Democratic Republic of Congo and
Indonesia remaining negative in the next 12 months, she said.
 Stockpiles  on the London Metal Exchange have fallen 42 percent
this year, indicating a severe deficit, she said.  Tin for three-month delivery advanced 1.6 percent to
$26,000 a metric ton today, bringing the gain this year to 53
percent, already the best of the LME metals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
