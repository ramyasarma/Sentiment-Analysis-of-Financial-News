Cotton rose the most allowed by ICE
Futures U.S., touching a three-week high, on signs of robust
demand. Orange juice fell.  In the week ended Dec. 2, U.S. shipments of upland cotton
jumped 21 percent from a year earlier to 323,356 bales, the
Department of Agriculture said. Last week, the U.S. exported
322,977 bales. Futures in New York have surged 80 percent this
year, heading for the biggest annual gain since 1973.  “That’s a big shipment number,” said  Keith Brown , the
president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in Moultrie,
Georgia. “These numbers are healthy.”  Cotton futures for March delivery jumped the exchange
maximum of 4 cents, or 3 percent, to settle at $1.3595 a pound
at 2:41 p.m. on ICE in New York. That’s the highest since Nov.
16. Prices reached a record $1.5195 on Nov. 10.  “The market is intact to the upside,” said Brown, who
estimated prices may rise to $1.38 next week.  The U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, is forecast to ship
15.75 million bales in the year ending July 31, up from 12.04
million last season, the USDA  said  on Nov. 9. A bale weighs
about 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  The USDA will update its global crop projections tomorrow
at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  Stockpiles Drop  U.S.  inventories  held in warehouses monitored by ICE fell
19 percent to 99,957 bales yesterday, the first decline since
early October. Stockpiles are down 76 percent this year.  Output in India, the world’s second-biggest exporter, may
miss an earlier estimate because of unseasonal rainfall, a
textile mills group said. A bale in India weighs 375 pounds, or
170 kilograms.  Production may total 29.5 million to 30 million bales for
the year that began Oct. 1, the Confederation of Indian Textiles
Industry said. That compares with 32.5 million predicted by the
Cotton Advisory Board.  The Indian news is a “bullish story,”  Mike Stevens , an
independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana, said in an e-mail.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery dropped 3.55
cents, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $1.6245 a pound in New York.
Prices have gained 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
