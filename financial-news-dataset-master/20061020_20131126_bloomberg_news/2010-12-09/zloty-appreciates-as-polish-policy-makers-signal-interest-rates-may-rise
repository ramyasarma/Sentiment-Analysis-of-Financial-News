The zloty gained for the first time
in four days after two central bankers signaled Poland may need
higher interest rates to curb inflation and Japanese and
Australian data boosted confidence in the global recovery.  The zloty appreciated 0.1 percent to 4.0363 per euro as of
4:25 p.m. in Warsaw after earlier rising as much as 0.5 percent.
Poland’s currency weakened 1.6 percent in the previous three
days.  The central bank should start raising rates within three
months to damp inflation, policy maker  Andrzej Bratkowski , who
last month surprised markets by backing away from calls for a
preemptive increase, said yesterday in an interview. The economy
may now be expanding at a rate that will lead to “price growth
on a sustained basis,” another central banker,  Andrzej Rzonca ,
said late yesterday in an interview on TVN CNBC television.  “The comments sound a bit more hawkish,” said  Gaelle Blanchard , an emerging-markets strategist at Societe Generale SA
in London. “That may be helping, but we also had a strong
session in Asia and the sentiment is generally more positive.”  Asian currencies rose, led by South Korea’s won, after
Japan said its economy expanded more than initially estimated in
the third quarter and hiring picked up in Australia. The Polish
central bank has kept its  main interest rate  at a record low for
17 months to boost economic growth. A report last month showed
 economic expansion  accelerated to 4.2 percent in the third
quarter, the fastest pace in two years  To contact the reporter on this story:
