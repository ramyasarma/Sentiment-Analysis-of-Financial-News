U.K. stocks climbed for the third
time in four days as banks and mining companies rallied and
economic reports boosted confidence in the global recovery.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Barclays Plc both
gained more than 3 percent. Lonmin Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd.
advanced with precious metal prices, while  BG Group Plc  jumped
3.6 percent after the oil producer said initial oil reserves in
Brazil will be about 600 million barrels.  The  FTSE 100 Index  gained 13.43, or 0.2 percent, to
5,807.96 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The benchmark gauge
has climbed 7.3 percent this year, boosted by company earnings
and a second round of bond-buying at the Federal Reserve. The
 FTSE All-Share Index  rose 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s
 ISEQ Index  advanced 1 percent.  “Financials added over five points” to the FTSE 100,
London-based  Nick Serff , a market analyst at City Index Group
Ltd., said. “Mining companies also advanced after a snap back
for bullion prices following yesterday’s rout in gold and
silver.”  Stocks climbed as a report showed that fewer Americans
filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments in
the U.S. last week. Separate figures showed Japan’s economy grew
more than the government initially estimated in the third
quarter while Australian employers last month added more than
double the number of workers economists had forecast.  Barclays, Standard Chartered  Barclays led a gauge of banks shares higher, rallying 4.5

pence, its first gain in five days. HSBC Holdings Plc gained 1.2
percent 666.7 pence.  Standard Chartered Plc dropped 3.6 percent to 1,810 pence
as the bank, which generates more than three-quarters of
earnings from Asia, said second-half “income levels” will be
“broadly flat” from the previous six months. Net interest
income fell “fractionally” this year from 2009, the bank said
in a statement.  Lonmin, the third-largest platinum producer, increased 2.9
percent to 1,857 pence as precious metals rebound in New York.
BHP Billiton gained 1.7 percent to 2,469 pence and African
Barrick Gold Ltd. increased 1.5 percent to 609 pence.  Gold rose in New York, halting a two-day slide, as
investors snapped up the precious metal as an alternative to
currencies after prices dropped from a record. Silver, palladium
and platinum also advanced.  BG Group, Cobham  BG Group advanced 3.6 percent to 1,333.5 pence after the
company also said it anticipates “very low” unit technical
costs for the initial phase of the Tupi and Guara fields. The
company forecast capital costs of $5 and operating costs of $9 a
barrel of oil equivalent.  Cobham Plc jumped 3.7 percent to 203.6 pence on reports the
world’s largest maker of airborne-refueling equipment may be a
takeover target. The Financial Times’ Alphaville said U.S.-based
Northrop Grumman Corp. may be a bidder, citing market
speculation.  Ashtead Group Plc  jumped 10 percent to 158 pence after the
construction equipment-rental company reported a 49 percent jump
in second-quarter pretax earnings to 18.1 million pounds ($28.7
million).  HMV Group Plc  paced declining shares on the broader All-
Share Index after the music and DVD retailer said its first-half
loss widened to 31.3 million pounds on lower demand in U.K. and
Ireland stores. The stock sank 16 percent to 36.5 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
