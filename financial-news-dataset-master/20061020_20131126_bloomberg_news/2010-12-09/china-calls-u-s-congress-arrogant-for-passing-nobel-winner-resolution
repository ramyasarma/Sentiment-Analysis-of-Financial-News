China criticized a U.S. Congressional
 resolution  expressing support for jailed dissident and Nobel
Peace Prize winner  Liu Xiaobo  as “arrogant.”  The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday passed by a
vote of 402-1 a measure praising Liu, who is imprisoned in China
and won’t attend tomorrow’s award ceremony in Oslo. China has
condemned the decision of Norway’s Nobel committee as political
interference.  “The resolution by the U.S. House disregards facts,
confuses right and wrong and flagrantly interferes in China’s
internal affairs,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman  Jiang Yu  said
today in Beijing. U.S. lawmakers need to “change their arrogant
and unreasonable attitude and show due respect for Chinese
people and China’s judicial sovereignty.”  Liu sought to “overthrow” China’s political system in
actions that “jeopardized society,” Jiang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
