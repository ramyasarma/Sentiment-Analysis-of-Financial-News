Bayer AG , Europe’s largest drug and
chemical maker, plans to more than double sales in China by 2015
from 2009 to about 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion), the company
said in an e-mailed statement.  The Leverkusen, Germany-based company plans to spend about
1 billion euros to expand production capacity for high-grade
materials in Shanghai, according to the statement. Bayer’s sales
in China were 2.1 billion euros in fiscal 2009, it said.  “The strong economic growth in China and in the whole
region offers us outstanding opportunities,”  Patrick Thomas ,
chief executive officer of Bayer MaterialScience, said in the
statement. “It is strategically important to have the necessary
capacities in the Asia Pacific region to meet constantly rising
demand,” he said.  Bayer’s polycarbonates business will be relocated from
Leverkusen to Shanghai beginning next year, it said. The Asia
Pacific region accounts for about 60 percent of the world’s
market for polycarbonate, a plastic used in the automotive,
electronics and construction industries, Bayer said.  The company will build a new polycarbonate plant in
Shanghai with annual capacity of 200,000 metric tons and expand
an existing facility by 50 percent to 300,000 tons, according to
the statement.  -- Baizhen Chua . Editors:  Clyde Russell ,  John Viljoen .  To contact the reporter on this story:
