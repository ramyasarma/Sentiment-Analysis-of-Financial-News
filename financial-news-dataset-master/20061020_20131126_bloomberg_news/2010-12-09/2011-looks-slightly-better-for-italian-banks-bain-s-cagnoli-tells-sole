Next year will be slightly better
than 2010 for Italian banks, Giovanni Cagnoli, chief executive
officer for Italy at Bain & Co., told Il Sole 24 Ore in an
interview.  Non-performing loan growth will slow compared with 2010,
with the result of lower provisions, Cagnoli told Sole.  Recent share-price performance by banks has been a result
of “speculative movement,” Cagnoli said. Fundamentals are
improving and “I don’t see any reason for excessive concern,”
he told the daily.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
