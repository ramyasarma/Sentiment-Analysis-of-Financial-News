China’s three commodity futures
exchanges may increase sizes for agricultural and metal
contracts to curb speculation, the Oriental Morning Post
reported, citing managers at brokerages it didn’t identify.  Soybean and soybean oil contracts may be increased to 60
metric tons and 30 tons respectively from 10 tons, the Shanghai-
based  newspaper  said, citing a futures analyst it didn’t
identify. Contracts for other products may be increased by
varying degrees, it said without elaborating or citing anyone.  A spokesman at the Dalian Commodity Exchange, where
soybeans and soybean oil are traded, said the three bourses are
discussing changing contract sizes and no decisions have been
reached. He declined to be identified or to elaborate. Calls to
the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and the Shanghai Futures
Exchange were not answered.  Contracts that are already traded won’t be affected, so the
policy changes won’t impact trading immediately, the newspaper
said without citing anyone. Raising the sizes of contracts will
lift the required capital and keep smaller speculators from the
futures markets, the newspaper said.  China’s commodities futures are state-owned and controlled
by the China Security Regulatory Commission, according to their
websites. Calls to Liu Xinhua, an office director at the
security regulator, were not answered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
