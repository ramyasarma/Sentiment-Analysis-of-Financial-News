Oil may halt its advance past a 26-
month peak above $90 a barrel because of resistance on technical
charts indicated by Bollinger Bands, according to Cameron
Hanover Inc.  Crude climbed to $90.76 a barrel on Dec. 7, the highest
intraday price since October 2008. While futures may again
surpass the “psychologically important” $90 level, investors
will probably start selling contracts when prices advance to
around $90.55, said  Peter Beutel , president of the energy
adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut. That is the higher of two
Bollinger Bands.  “The Bollinger Bands continue to offer resistance
overhead,” Beutel said in an e-mailed note. “There is room for
a good deal more weakness than we saw on Wednesday.”  Oil rebounded from a two-day drop today after an Energy
Department report showed U.S.  crude stockpiles  fell almost three
times more than forecast, as refiners boosted processing rates
by the most since October 2008. The contract for January
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as much as 1
percent in electronic trading to $89.20 a barrel.  Bollinger Bands, which plot support and resistance levels
based on volatility, are often used by investors to determine
entry points for buying or selling contracts. Crude fell in
early August, early October and mid-November after rising above
the upper band and rebounded in late May and August after
slipping below the lower band.  The market’s failure to extend gains after topping $90 a
barrel presents a “really persuasive bull trap,” Beutel said
earlier this week. This means buyers may misinterpret increases
as a signal for further profits.  “Buy stops,” or levels where a rally may stall, start
from $89.50 a barrel, then $89.85, before the 26-month high of
$90.76, according to Beutel. On the downside, futures may drop
to as low as $88.15 before a rebound, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
