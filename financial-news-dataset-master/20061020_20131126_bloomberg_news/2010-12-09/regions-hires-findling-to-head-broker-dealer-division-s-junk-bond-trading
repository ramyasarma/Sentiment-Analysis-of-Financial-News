Regions Financial Corp.,  the largest
bank in Alabama, hired  Andrew Findling  to head junk-bond trading
for its broker-dealer unit.  Findling, 38, joined  Morgan Keegan Inc.  on Dec. 1 and
reports to  Richard Travis , said  Kevin Giddis , president of fixed
income, in a telephone interview. He previously worked as a
high-yield trader at Morgan Stanley and BlackRock Inc.  The hiring is part of “a new effort” to win more
speculative-grade bond underwriting and co-management
assignments, particularly among energy companies, Giddis said.
It comes at the end of a year of record junk-bond issuance, with
$275.2 billion in debt issued as of Dec. 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We as a firm made a decision earlier this year to expand
our efforts in the high-yield space,” said  Neal Smith , who
heads corporate-bond banking at Morgan Keegan. Findling, who is
based in New York, joins a team of about 150 fixed-income
institutional sales professionals.  So far this year, the company has served as co-manager on
15 deals, including a $750 million issuance from  Energy XXI Gulf
Coast Inc.  and a $300 million offering from  Berry Petroleum Co. ,
Smith said. That compares with eight such assignments last year.  Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk and rated below Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and less than BBB- by S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
