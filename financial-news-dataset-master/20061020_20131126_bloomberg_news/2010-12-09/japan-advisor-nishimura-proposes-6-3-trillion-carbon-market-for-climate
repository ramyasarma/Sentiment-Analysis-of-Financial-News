Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, Japan’s chief
climate-protection negotiator during the three years through
2008, proposed a $6.3 trillion carbon market to kick-start
stalled talks.  The world could sell 250 billion metric tons of carbon-
dioxide allowances to emitters in the 10 years through 2020,
generating “a huge chunk of new wealth” that could help poor
nations cope with the impact of global warming and other needs,
Nishimura said yesterday in an interview at  United Nations talks 
in Cancun, Mexico. He handed to Bloomberg an 11-page document
outlining the plan.  “The key part is to cap globally and sell allowances to
all corporations,” said Nishimura, who now advises the Japanese
cabinet on climate matters. His proposal is not yet supported by
Japan, nor any other nation, he said.  Under the plan, governments would divide up 660 billion
tons of allowances through 2050. In the first phase, the 250
billion tons could be sold potentially at $25 each. The
incentive of the cash would prompt governments to overcome
differences and settle on a global peaking year for emissions
and a distribution of allowances to each nation.  “The ultimate payment is going to be made by households”
consuming goods and services that require fossil-fuel
combustion, Nishimura said. “There would be a single carbon
price.”  Nations would sell 200 billion tons in the 10 years through
2030, 150 billion tons in the decade after and 60 billion tons
in the final phase of the 40-year program, according to the
plan. International negotiations on the plan might delay its
start until about 2020, he said.  U.K. Budgets  The U.K. is already setting carbon budgets. The nation
should commit to a 60 percent reduction in carbon-dioxide
emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels to meet its targets for 2050,
that country’s Climate Change Committee said Dec. 7.  This would mean tightening targets through 2020, the
committee said, adding that proposed emissions reductions can be
achieved at a cost of less than 1 percent of gross domestic
product.  The U.K. has pledged to get 15 percent of its energy from
renewable sources by 2020 and reduce carbon-dioxide by 80
percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Achieving this will require as
much as 40,000 megawatts of low-carbon energy projects and a
“radical reform” of the electricity markets, the group said.  The World Bank today initiated a partnership with nations
to raise $100 million for the investigation of new carbon
markets, speeding climate protection, said bank President  Robert Zoellick .  New Carbon Markets  Participants include the U.S., which will contribute $5
million, said  Billy Pizer , a deputy assistant secretary in the
U.S. Treasury Department, at climate talks in Cancun, Mexico. At
least $30 million has been raised for the partnership, said
 Joelle Chassard , manager of the bank’s Carbon Finance Unit.  Today’s launch of the initiative was attended by
representatives of Japan, the European Union, Indonesia,
Australia and South Africa. The European Commission will
contribute 5 million euros ($6.3 million) to the partnership,
said Peter Wehrheim, a commission climate official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
