Canadian new-home  prices  rose 0.1
percent in October, led by Toronto and Vancouver, government
figures showed.  Prices rose 0.2 percent in Canada’s largest city, and 0.1
percent in Vancouver, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
October’s increase matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg
 survey  of 13 responses and followed a 0.2 percent gain in
September.  From a year earlier, new-home prices increased 2.5 percent
in October, slower than September’s 2.7 percent pace.  Housing is slowing after the government ended temporary
stimulus measures and Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  warned
about record high household debts.  The Canadian Real Estate Association last month cut its
home resales forecast for the second time this year, citing a
sluggish economic recovery and weak consumer confidence. Sales
will fall 4.9 percent to 442,200 units this year and by 9
percent next year to 402,500 units, the group said in a Nov. 5
e-mailed statement.  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported yesterday
 housing starts  rose to an annual pace of 187,200 units in
November, the first gain in four months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
