OAO Gazprom plans to spend 300
billion rubles ($9.7 billion) on the Bovanenkovo gas field, its
pilot project on the Yamal Peninsula, in the next three years,
Vedomosti said, citing Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko.    Bovanenkovo, Gazprom’s third-largest deposit, will produce
45 billion cubic meters in 2013, about 8 percent of the
company’s output, the newspaper said today, citing Shmatko.  In 2008, Gazprom estimated the total capital expenditure on
the project at 300 billion rubles over five years, while
building transportation capacity may cost about $90 billion
more, Vedomosti said. The Russian gas export monopoly spent 180
billion rubles for Bovanenkovo and the neighboring Kharasavei
fields in 2007-2010, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
