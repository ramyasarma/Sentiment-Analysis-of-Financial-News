Kagiso Trust Investments Ltd. and
TisoGroup, two South African holding companies owned by black
investors, plan to merge to create a company with combined
assets of more than 12 billion rand ($1.74 billion).  The “consolidation of our platforms will fast track the
growth aspirations of both companies,” Kagiso Managing Director
Kgomotso Matseke said in an e-mailed statement today. The
“complementary and diverse assets will allow for strategic
consolidation and stronger cash flows.”  The combined entity, which will be called Kagiso Trust
Holdings once completed by mid-2011, will gain better access to
“larger and more attractive transactions,” the companies said.
South African companies are required by law to have black
shareholders to diversify ownership of Africa’s largest economy
to make up for exclusion under apartheid which ended in 1994.  Kagiso was started by a trust formed in 1986 by the South
African Council of Churches and European Commission to fund the
struggle against apartheid. It owns stakes in FirstRand Ltd.,
Macsteel Holdings Ltd. and Bytes Technology Group. Tiso’s
investments include shares in Aveng Ltd.’s Grinaker-LTA unit and
AECI Ltd.’s African Explosives Ltd., according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
