U.K. natural-gas contracts fell as
demand for the fuel declined and an additional liquefied gas
carrier headed to Britain. Power for tomorrow also declined.  National Grid Plc forecast demand will fall to 429 million
cubic meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, about 20 million less than
yesterday. That’s the lowest estimate for four days after
freezing weather boosted demand for the heating fuel.  Gas for January delivery slipped as much as 1.3 pence, or
2.1 percent, to 59.2 pence a therm. It was at 59.25 pence as of
11:20 a.m. in London. That’s equal to $9.34 a million British
thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btus. The contract reached a
22-month high of 62 pence a therm on Dec. 6.  The liquefied natural gas tanker Duhail is sailing to the
South Hook terminal in Wales, according to the Milford Haven
Port Authority website. It’s due to arrive on Dec. 16 and has a
capacity of 210,100 cubic meters of LNG.  Gas for immediate delivery fell 1.4 pence to 62.5 pence.  The U.K. and Ireland may have the coldest December since
1890 and one of the snowiest three on record, Jim Dale, a senior
meteorologist at British Weather Services in High Wycombe,
England, said by e-mail.  “If you think the weather couldn’t get any worse, then
think again,” he said. “The outflow of frigid air from the
northeast is set to bring us all back into the deep freezer,
possibly for a lengthy period” as early as Dec. 14, he said.  Snowfall may be the heaviest recorded for December,
competing with 1981 and 1878, Dale said.  U.K. baseload power for the next working day fell 9 pounds,
or 15 percent, to 52.25 pounds a megawatt-hour as milder weather
in the coming days may cut heating use. Power for January gained
0.9 percent to 53.50 pounds a megawatt-hour.  Minimum London temperatures may rise to a low of minus 1
degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) tomorrow, according to
CustomWeather Inc., compared with today’s minimum of minus 2
degrees. Milder weather lowers demand for gas-fired heating and
may allow storage inventories to be replenished.  To contact the reporters on this story:
