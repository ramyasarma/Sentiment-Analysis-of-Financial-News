Melky Cabrera  and  J.J. Hardy  wound up
with new teams today as baseball’s Winter Meetings concluded in
Orlando, Florida.  Outfielder Cabrera, 26, who spent parts of five years with
the New York Yankees, reached a preliminary one-year, $1.25
million agreement with the Kansas City Royals, the Associated
Press reported.  Cabrera batted .255 with a .317 on-base percentage and four
home runs last season, his first after being traded to the
Atlanta Braves from the Yankees. He made his Major League
Baseball debut with the Yankees in 2005 and became a fan
favorite on June 6, 2006, by reaching over the outfield wall to
steal a home run from  Manny Ramirez  of the Boston Red Sox.  The Baltimore Orioles acquired shortstop Hardy, 28,
infielder  Brendan Harris  and $500,000 from the Minnesota Twins
in exchange for a pair of minor league right-handed pitchers.  Hardy, a 2007 All-Star, batted .268 with six home runs and
38 runs batted in last season. The Orioles, who acquired
slugging third baseman  Mark Reynolds  from the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Dec. 6, hit 133 home runs last year, the fewest
in the American League East.  The New York Mets made two free-agent moves, signing
catcher  Ronny Paulino  and relief pitcher  D.J. Carrasco . Paulino,
29, a career .273 hitter with 31 home runs, spent his first six
years with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Florida Marlins. Paulino,
who signed a one-year deal with the Mets, will miss the first
eight games of the 2011 season while serving the remainder of a
50-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-
enhancing substance.  Carrasco, 33, who signed a two-year contract with the Mets,
spent last season with the Pirates and Diamondbacks. In 63
appearances, he was 3-2 with a 3.68 ERA and 65 strikeouts, both
career bests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
