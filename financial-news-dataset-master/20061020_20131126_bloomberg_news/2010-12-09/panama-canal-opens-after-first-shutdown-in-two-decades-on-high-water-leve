The Panama Canal, which handles more
than 200 million metric tons of  cargo  a year, opened today after
rain forced the first closure of the waterway since 1989.  The 80 kilometer (50-mile) canal, connecting the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans, opened after 17 hours, the Panama Canal
Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. Ships were
stopped yesterday after the main river and lake used by vessels
reached record levels.  The canal last closed when the U.S. invaded the Central
American nation to oust then-President Manuel Noriega. Shutting
the waterway obliges ships to sail around the tip of South
America, resulting in longer trips and higher costs.  The length of the delay should mean no impact for shipping,
 Amrita Sen , a London-based analyst with Barclays Capital, said
by phone today. Daily rates to hire  panamax  ships, the largest
carriers of bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore that can
fit the canal’s locks, were little changed at $19,028, according
to the Baltic Exchange in London.  The canal, first transited in 1914, is used by about 14,000
ships a year and employs 9,000 people, according to the Panama
Canal Authority. Ships carry about 90 percent of world trade,
handling 7.7 billion tons of cargo in 2008, according to the
Round Table of International Shipping Associations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
