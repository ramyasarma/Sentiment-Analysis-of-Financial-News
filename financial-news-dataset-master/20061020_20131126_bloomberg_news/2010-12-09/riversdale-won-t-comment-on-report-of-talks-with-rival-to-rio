Riversdale Mining Ltd. declined to
comment on a report in the Australian Financial Review that it
may be in talks with another group. Riversdale outside spokesman
Bill Kemmery, who works for communications company Fortbridge
Media Pty, said in an e-mail that the company remains in
previously announced talks with Wuhan Iron & Steel Group. The
newspaper said Riversdale may be in talks with Anglo American
Plc or Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., without citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
