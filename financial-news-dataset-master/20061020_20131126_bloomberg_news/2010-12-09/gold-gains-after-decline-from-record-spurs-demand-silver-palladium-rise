Gold futures rebounded after
investors snapped up the precious metal as an alternative to
currencies following a decline from a record. Silver also
gained.  The euro dropped against most major currencies after
Ireland’s credit rating was downgraded, adding to concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will escalate. Gold slid 2.3 percent in the
previous two days after reaching a record $1,432.50 an ounce on
Dec. 7.  “The bottom line is that investors are losing faith in
paper money,” said  Lannie Cohen , the president of  Capitol
Commodity Services Inc.  in Indianapolis. “Gold will continue to
act as the currency of choice.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose $9.60, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,392.80 on the Comex in New York. The
price has gained 27 percent this year, heading for the 10th
annual gain.  “If you were in Europe, you’d be buying gold to preserve
your wealth,” Cohen said. The metal priced in euros reached a
record on Dec. 7.  U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Dec. 14 to
discuss a potential plan to extend Treasury purchases to support
the economy. President  Barack Obama  this week agreed to extend
tax reductions to boost growth, a measure that may widen the
$1.3 trillion budget deficit.  Inflation Expected  “The government is not going to cut back on spending, so
the bull camp is looking ahead to inflation,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 3.38 metric
tons to 2,097.98 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  “People are happy to buy here,” said  Bernard Sin , the
head of currency and metal trading at MKS Finance SA, a bullion
refiner in Geneva. “There’s still a lot of concern in the euro
zone and the U.S.”  Gold’s gains may be limited this month as traders book 2010
profit, Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock said.  “This is no longer a buy-and-hold trade,” he said. “For
the rest of the year, the bears and the bulls are going to duke
it out.”  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 56.5 cents, or 2
percent, to $28.817 an ounce. On Dec. 7, the metal reached
$30.75, the highest price since March 1980. The price has jumped
71 percent this year.  Palladium, Platinum  Palladium futures for March delivery gained $12.65, or 1.7
percent, to $741.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal has surged 81 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $2.50, or 0.1
percent, to $1,678.90 an ounce. The price has gained 14 percent
this year.  Platinum ETP holdings jumped 0.94 ton to 35.76 tons
yesterday, the highest amount since at least February, data
compiled from three providers show. Palladium assets gained 1.94
tons to 67.44 tons, also the highest amount since at least
February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
