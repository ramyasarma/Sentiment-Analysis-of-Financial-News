Treasuries pared advances after the
Federal Reserve purchased less seven-year debt today under its
program of quantitative easing than some investors expected.  “The Fed still bought a lot of the sector, but there was
more expectation,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of interest rates
in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 18 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “We are mulling around near
yesterday’s levels and seeing where the day takes us.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.26 percent at 11:23 a.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 rose 1/8, or $1.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 94 21/32. The yield earlier dropped
seven basis points to 3.20 percent.  The 10-year note yield increased 35 basis points over the
past two days in the biggest such gain since Sept. 19, 2008,
when markets were in upheaval following the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The yield touched 3.33 percent yesterday,
the highest level since June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
