Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox 360, helped by
its Kinect motion-capture controller, was the best-selling
video-game console in the U.S. for the sixth consecutive month,
the company said.  The Redmond, Washington-based software company sold 1.37
million Xbox consoles in November, David Dennis, group product
manager with Xbox, said today citing statistics from researcher
NPD Group Inc.  Nintendo Co.’s Wii sales gained 0.8 percent to 1.27 million
units, the company said separately. Sony Corp.’s PS3 sales fell
25 percent to 530,000 units from a year earlier, when the
company cut prices, Morgan Stanley said, citing NPD data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
