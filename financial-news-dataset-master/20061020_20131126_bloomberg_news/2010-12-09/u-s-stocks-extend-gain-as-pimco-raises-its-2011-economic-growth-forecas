U.S. stocks extended gains, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average erasing most of an earlier loss,
after the manager of the world’s largest bond fund raised its
forecast for economic growth because of government stimulus.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to a
two-year high of 1,233.3 at 3:46 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average was little changed at 11,372.03 after
falling as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, is raising its forecast for U.S.
growth next year as policy makers pump a “massive amount” of
stimulus into the economy, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-
Erian said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
