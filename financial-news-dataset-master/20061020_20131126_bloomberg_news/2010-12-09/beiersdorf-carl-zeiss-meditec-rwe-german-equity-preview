German stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark DAX Index toward its highest close in more than two
years, amid forecasts that companies will continue to grow
profits even as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis spreads.  Carmakers led gains in the DAX, climbing at least 3
percent.  MorphoSys AG  gained 10 percent after raising its sales
forecast.  Symrise AG  retreated 3.3 percent as Deutsche Bank AG
downgraded shares of the fragrance maker.  The  DAX  rose 42.01, or 0.6 percent, to 7,006.17 at the 5:30

weekly gain, the longest streak of gains since April. The
broader HDAX Index also rose 0.6 percent today.  “European equities continue to benefit from low valuation
levels and moderate economic improvement, reflected in improving
profitability and free cash flow generation,”  Edmund Shing ,
London-based strategist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a market
outlook report presented yesterday in London. “With 2011 now
firmly in view, we have established a positive outlook for
European equities over the next 12 months in spite of the
current market obsession on potential euro-area contagion
risks.”  European equities will climb 12 percent through the end of
next year, beating 2010’s gains, as rising earnings and record-
low interest rates help companies overcome the sovereign-debt
crisis, a Bloomberg survey of 13 strategists shows.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most bullish forecaster, says
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will rally 20 percent because profits
may expand twice as fast as the 14 percent average rate in more
than 26,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  VW, BMW, Daimler  The DAX has climbed 18 percent this year as corporate
profits rose, the Federal Reserve unveiled a $600 billion bond
purchase program to assist the U.S. economy’s recovery and the
European Union bailed out Greece and Ireland.  Volkswagen AG rallied 3.9 percent to 129 euros after
Europe’s largest carmaker said November group vehicle sales
increased 16 percent to 617,100 cars, vans and sport-utility
vehicles.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the world’s largest maker
of luxury cars, gained 3.9 percent to 62.52 euros, while Daimler
AG, the second-biggest, advanced 3 percent to 54.87 euros.  MorphoSys, HeidelbergCement  MorphoSys  jumped 10 percent to 17.45 euros, the biggest
gain in almost two years. The biotechnology company increased
revenue guidance for 2010 to a range of 91 million euros ($120
million) to 94 million euros, from a previous range of 89
million euros to 90 million euros, citing extra sales from its
purchase of Sloning Biotechnology GmbH. MorphoSys has also
signed a long-term alliance with Pfizer Inc. for the U.S.
drugmaker to use its Sloning Technology Platform.  HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s third-largest maker of
cement and concrete, slid 1.7 percent to 45.91 euros, the first
retreat this week. The company has been informed by the European
Commission that it is being probed along with seven other cement
producers for suspected antitrust violations, HeidelbergCement
said in an e-mailed statement today. The cement maker said it
believes that it can refute the allegations.  Symrise lost 3.3 percent to 19.25 euros after Deutsche bank
