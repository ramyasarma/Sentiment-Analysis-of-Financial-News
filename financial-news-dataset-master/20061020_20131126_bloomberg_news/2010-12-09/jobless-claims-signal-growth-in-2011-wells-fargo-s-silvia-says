The strengthening U.S. labor market
will bring job creation and economic growth in 2011, said  John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in
Charlotte, North Carolina.  Applications for jobless benefits fell to 421,000, less
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, from a revised 438,000 the prior week, Labor Department
figures showed today. The four-week moving average dropped to
the lowest level in more than two years.  “The sentiment is that labor economy is improving with
 jobless claims  coming down,” Silvia said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview on “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .
“We do expect job opportunities to improve throughout 2011.”  Wells Fargo this week raised its forecast for the monthly
average private payroll growth in 2011 to 161,300 from 151,300.  “It’s not the kind of employment gains where you really
get significant gains in the  unemployment rate , but it’s enough
to at least hold it steady right now,” Silvia said. Initial
jobless claims falling to the 430,000 “area does signify to us
that there is a change,” he said.  Wells Fargo also revised its forecast for growth in the
world’s largest economy, raising it to 2.6 percent from 2.5
percent. Silvia cited the trend in jobless claims, stabilizing
orders for capital goods and an improvement in Institute for
Supply Management reports on services and manufacturing for the
revision.  Silvia said the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to
buy $600 billion in Treasury securities, along with Congress’s
potential resolution on taxes “does suggest we’re going for
growth.”  At the same time, the U.S. economy still faces headwinds as
consumers pay off debts and cautious state and local governments
reduce spending in the second half of 2011, Silvia said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
