FIFA President Sepp Blatter said
countries near Qatar could host some 2022 World Cup games,
L’Equipe newspaper reported, citing an interview with the head
of the soccer ruling body.  FIFA executives last week chose Qatar as the first Arab
nation to host the tournament.  Blatter said Australia, another bidder, had proposed to host
games in New Zealand and Qatar could do the same with “nearby
countries,” L’Equipe reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
