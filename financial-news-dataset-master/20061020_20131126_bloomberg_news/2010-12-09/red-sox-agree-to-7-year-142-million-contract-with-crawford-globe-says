The Boston Red Sox and free-agent
outfielder Carl Crawford have agreed to a seven-year, $142
million contract, the Boston Globe reported on its website.  The deal will be completed today and contains partial no-
trade protection, the Globe said, citing an unidentified Major
League Baseball person familiar with the negotiations.  Crawford, 29, batted .296 with 104 homers, 592 runs batted
in and 409 stolen bases in nine seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays.
He’s a four-time All-Star.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
