Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
Europe are poised to drop this month after the profit from the
trade tumbled to a six-week low.  U.S. gasoline was 1.1 cents a gallon cheaper than Europe’s
on Dec. 6, the biggest discount since Oct. 21, based on futures
for delivery to New York harbor and benchmark  95-octane  grade
fuel in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region. It was 10.3
cents a gallon  more expensive  than Europe’s as recently as Nov.
29, the biggest premium since Aug. 9.  November’s price gain was “temporary,” said Roy Jordan, a
London-based research consultant at Facts Global Energy. U.S.
gasoline “demand has fallen versus last year,” he said.  European shipments of gasoline to the U.S. tripled last
month as the lowest American inventories in a year drove up
returns from buying in one market and selling in the other.
That’s now evaporating as U.S. refiners step up processing rates
after seasonal maintenance. Stockpiles of the fuel unexpectedly
rose in the week ended Dec. 3, the Energy Department in
Washington said yesterday.  The number of tankers chartered to ship gasoline to the
U.S. Atlantic Coast rose to at least 29 in November, from 11 in
October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and  Clarkson 
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest
shipbroker. The vessels carried 1.12 million metric tons,
compared with 412,000 tons in October.  Crack Spread  Gasoline for January delivery traded at $2.3587 a gallon on
the New York Mercantile Exchange today, bringing the gain this
year to 15 percent. It reached $2.3699 a gallon on Dec. 6, the
highest price since May 4. In Europe, the fuel was at $813 a ton
yesterday, or $2.2772 a gallon, for a 16 percent advance this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose to $837 a
ton on Dec. 6, a 26-month high.  In the U.S., the profit from turning crude into gasoline
“fell as a result of the storage build and increased refinery
runs,” reported by the Energy Department, JP Morgan analysts
wrote in a research note.  The profit in Europe, the so-called  crack spread , widened
to $7.15 a barrel on Dec. 2, the most since Aug. 2 and more than
triple the $2.35 reached on Nov. 9, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an independent broker that handles more than
100 million barrels of oil derivatives a day. The spread was
$5.50 today.  Gasoline has brought “some Christmas cheer to the
refiners,” said Jordan.  Refining margins may still decline as the cost of crude
increases, according to  Torbjoern Kjus , senior oil market
analyst at Oslo-based bank DnB NOR. Oil has gained almost 12
percent this year and traded above $90 a barrel on Dec. 7 for
the first time in more than two years.  ‘Crushed by Crude’  “A weak sign here is that margins are not keeping up with
flat price movements,” Kjus said. They are “starting to get
crushed by the crude strength in Europe and the U.S.”  U.S. inventories  rose 3.81 million barrels to 214 million
in the week ended Dec. 3, the Energy Department said yesterday.
They were forecast to decline by 300,000 barrels, according to
the median of 17 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Stockpiles were 207.7 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 12,
the lowest since October last year.  European producers boosted production last month to make
up for stoppages caused by strikes in France that shut nine of
the country’s 11 refineries. Oil companies lost 230 million
euros ($304 million) from the action, according to Union
Francaise des Industries Petrolieres, a Paris-based industry
group.  European Inventories  Gasoline inventories in independent storage fell  to 482,000
tons  in the week through Nov. 25 in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp region, Europe’s oil-trading hub, the lowest level since
Oct. 2, 2008, according to PJK International BV, an Oosterhout,
Netherlands-based petroleum-industry researcher.  The cost of shipping gasoline from Europe to the U.S.
Atlantic Coast rose to  Worldscale 213.75  today, or about  $16,254
a day  after fuel costs are taken into account, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange. The rate was at 214.17 on Dec. 6,
the highest since July 20.  Worldscale  points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 routes. Flat rates for every
voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually by
the Worldscale Association in London to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  The fixtures from London-based Clarkson were drawn from
single-voyage bookings. Long-term charters weren’t included.  To contact the reporters on this story:
