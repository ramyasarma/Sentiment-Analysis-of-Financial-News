Total SA ,  Eni SpA ,  China National
Petroleum Corp.  and nine other companies submitted 14 bids for
rights to explore eight oil blocks in Syria, Deputy Oil Minister
Hassan Zainab said today.  Suncor Energy Inc. , Canada’s largest oil company that
operates in Syria as PetroCanada, U.K. explorer  Gulfsands
Petroleum Plc , Dallas-based Improved Petroleum Recovery, and
other Swedish and Arabic companies also bid, he said in a
telephone interview from Damascus.  Syria’s oil will run out within 18 years, according to its
reserves-to-production ratio as calculated by BP Plc, and the
country is trying to halt the decline in its output. The
contracts cover exploration and production for oil blocks that
extend over 40 percent of the nation’s territory, Zainab said
Sept. 1.  “The offers will be opened next week and the announcement
of the results of the bidding will be made in about two
months,” Zainab said today.  The government also plans to offer contracts for offshore
exploration in 2011, after having postponed the bidding from
this year. It auctioned licenses for seven fields last year.  Syria’s crude production peaked at 583,000 barrels a day in
1996. Last year, it pumped 390,000 barrels and the government
has forecast an output of 380,000 barrels a day this year.  Syria had proven oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels at the
end of 2009 and has the smallest gas deposits in the Middle East
after Bahrain, according to BP’s Statistical Review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
