JVC Kenwood Holdings Inc.  fell the
most in more than six months in Tokyo trading after the Yomiuri
newspaper reported Panasonic Corp. will reduce its stake in the
audio-equipment maker.  The  shares  tumbled 12.6 percent to 318 yen at the 3 p.m.
close, the biggest decline since May 17. The stock has slid 26
percent this year, compared with the 2.5 percent drop in Japan’s
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average . Panasonic, the world’s
largest maker of plasma televisions, gained 0.3 percent to 1,194
yen.  JVC Kenwood, based in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture, plans
to raise about 10 billion yen ($119 million) by selling new
shares as early as in January, Yomiuri reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  “Nothing has been decided,”  Takaaki Nose , a spokesman for
JVC Kenwood, said in a telephone interview today. The company
may consider ways of raising funds to boost its financial
strength, he said.  Akira Kadota , a Tokyo-based spokesman for
Panasonic wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Osaka-based  Panasonic , which owns 28 percent of JVC, won’t
buy shares and plans to cut its stake to less than 20 percent,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
