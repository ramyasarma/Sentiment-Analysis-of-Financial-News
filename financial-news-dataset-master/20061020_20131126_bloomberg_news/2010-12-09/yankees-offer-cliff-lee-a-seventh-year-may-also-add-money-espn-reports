Free-agent pitcher  Cliff Lee  met
with Texas Rangers executives and received a new offer from the
New York Yankees.  Rangers Managing Partner  Chuck Greenberg  was among team
officials who yesterday tired to convince left-hander Lee to re-
sign with the club he led to the World Series in October.  “We reaffirmed our commitment to fielding a championship-
caliber team and conveyed a menu of multiple offers which
represented a substantial additional commitment for both years
and dollars in an attempt to land his services,” Greenberg said
about the meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas.  The Yankees added a seventh year to their proposal to the
pitcher and may increase the average salary per year, ESPN
 reported , citing people familiar with the team who wished to
remain anonymous.  The Yankees originally offered the 32-year-old Lee a six-
year, $140 million contract, according to ESPN. The new offer is
a seven-year deal with an average salary per year less than the
$23.3 million of the six-year offer, ESPN said.  That deal would bring Lee close to the seven-year, $161
million contract that  CC Sabathia  signed with the Yankees in
2008. The Yankees may be willing to go to $25 million per year
to land two-time All-Star Lee, a baseball official told ESPN.  The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals also have
talked with Lee and agent Darek Braunecker.  Lee led the American League in complete games (seven),
fewest walks per nine innings (0.76) and strikeout-to-walk ratio
(10.28-to-1) last season, the final year of a five-year, $23
million contract.  Beat Yankees  Lee was a combined 12-9 with a 3.18 earned run average for
two teams in 2010 -- he was traded from the Seattle Mariners on
July 9 -- and 3-0 in his first three playoff starts, including
eight shutout innings against the Yankees on Oct. 18. In 10
career postseason starts, Lee is 7-2 with a 2.13 ERA.  Lee began his major league career with the Cleveland
Indians in 2002. In 2008, he went 22-3 with a 2.54 ERA for the
Indians and won the Cy Young Award, given to each league’s best
pitcher. Lee pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 and
was traded to the Mariners before the start of last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
