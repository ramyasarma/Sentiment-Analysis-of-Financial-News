Chimei Innolux Corp., Taiwan’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, said a 300 million
euro fine meted out by the European Union for price fixing was
above its expectations.  Provisions for the fine would likely be recognized in the
company’s fourth-quarter financial statements, Eddie Chen, a
spokesman for the Miaoli, Taiwan-based company said by phone
today. Chimei Innolux was formed this year by a merger between
Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., which was fined by the EU, and
Innolux Display Corp..   To contact the reporter on this story:
