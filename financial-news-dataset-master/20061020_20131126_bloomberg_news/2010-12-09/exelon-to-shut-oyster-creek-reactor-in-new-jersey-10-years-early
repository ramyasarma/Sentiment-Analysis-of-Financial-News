Exelon Corp.  will shut its Oyster
Creek reactor in New Jersey in 2019, a decade before its federal
license expires, the company said.  Chicago-based Exelon said it reached a deal with state
regulators on the closure date in exchange for not having to
install expensive cooling towers at the 619-megawatt reactor,
located 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Atlantic City.  Environmentalists have said the towers are needed to reduce
the plant’s impact on aquatic wildlife because the plant
currently pumps billions of gallons of hot water into Barnegat
Bay.  “Potential additional environmental compliance costs based
on evolving water cooling regulatory requirements -- at both the
federal and state government levels -- created significant
regulatory and economic uncertainty,” Exelon President  Chris Crane  said in an e-mailed statement released today.  Low market prices and demand, and the continuing need for
large capital expenditures, contributed to the decision, Crane
said.  Last month, workers at the 41-year-old plant, considered
one of the nation’s oldest, installed two new main transformers
in a $33 million project. The company also spent $13.3 million
to move pipes containing radioactive tritium above ground or
into monitored vaults, and about $4 million on other work during
the monthlong refueling and maintenance outage.  The plant produces enough electricity for 600,000 homes, or
about 6 percent of the state’s needs, and employs 700 people,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
