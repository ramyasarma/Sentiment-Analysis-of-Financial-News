Corn and soybeans fell in Chicago on
speculation that China may further tighten monetary policy to
curb inflation, reducing demand for commodities.  China’s statistics bureau brought forward the release of
November economic data including inflation and retail sales to
Dec. 11, heightening speculation the central bank will raise
interest rates this weekend. Consumer prices gained 4.4 percent
in October, the fastest pace in two years, because of higher
food costs. The country is the world’s biggest soybean importer.  “Corn and soybeans were under downward pressure from
speculation about China’s interest-rate hike,”  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at Tokyo-based commodity broker Central
Shoji Co., said today. Overall trade was thin before the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s global supply-and-demand report
tomorrow, he said.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$5.7375 a bushel at 11 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The grain touched a one-week low of $5.5225 yesterday.
Soybeans for January delivery dropped 4.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $12.9125 a bushel.  In China, some soybean crushers have halted production on
plunging profits as the government’s price-control measures
stalled sales of soybean oil and meal, the China National Grain
& Oils Information Center said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
