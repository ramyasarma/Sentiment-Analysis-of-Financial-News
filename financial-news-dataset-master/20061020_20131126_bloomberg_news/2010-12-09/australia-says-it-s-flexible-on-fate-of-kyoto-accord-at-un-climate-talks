Australia said it’s “flexible” on
the fate of the Kyoto Protocol limiting greenhouse gas
emissions, though it’s pushing for a new treaty that would bind
all major polluters to make reductions.  Climate Change Minister Greg Combet said such a new treaty
should include the U.S., China and “all major emitters.” The
next treaty should build on the Copenhagen Accord agreed last
year and not the 1997 Kyoto pact, which doesn’t require
developing nations to make cuts, he said.  “It’s pretty obvious that we should be building on
something that captures the bulk of the world’s emissions and
builds on that and doesn’t commit us to something that’s a much
more limited focus,” Combet said in Cancun, Mexico, at a United
Nations global warming conference.  Asked whether the two tracks of the negotiation -- one
involving Kyoto and the other a new treaty -- were ever apt to
become a single path in the talks, he said, “That’s what the
parties are working on as we speak.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
