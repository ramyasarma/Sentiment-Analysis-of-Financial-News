Bank of Queensland Ltd. , the regional
Australian bank formed in 1874, fell the most since 2008 in
Sydney trading after saying profit this year may rise less than
it earlier forecast.  The stock tumbled 7.1 percent to A$11.06 at 10:44 a.m.
local time, the most since Dec. 12, 2008. So-called normalized
profit after tax in the year ending August will be between A$210
million ($205 million) and A$230 million, lower than a previous
range of A$220 million to A$250 million, the bank said late
yesterday.  Bank of Queensland cut its earnings forecast after a jump
in soured commercial real-estate debts. The lender said that
market has been weaker than expected and almost doubled the
maximum possible charge for bad debts in the fiscal first half.  “We have seen the commercial property market continue to
underperform particularly in Queensland,” Managing Director
 David Liddy  said in the statement. “We remain cautious about a
recovery in commercial property valuations in the near term.”  The first-half expense for bad and doubtful debts may be as
high as A$90 million, above the previous forecast of about A$53
million, Bank of Queensland said. Those charges should fall
significantly in the second half, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
