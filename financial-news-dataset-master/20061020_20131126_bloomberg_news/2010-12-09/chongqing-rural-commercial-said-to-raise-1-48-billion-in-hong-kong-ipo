Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank Co. 
raised HK$11.5 billion ($1.48 billion) selling stock in a Hong
Kong initial public offering, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction.  The lender in Chongqing, China’s most populous city, sold
2.19 billion shares at HK$5.25 apiece after offering them at
HK$4.50 to HK$6.00 each, said the people, who declined to be
identified before an announcement. Morgan Stanley and Nomura
Holdings Inc. managed the sale.  Chongqing Bank braved a 7 percent slump in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  from the Nov. 8 peak that has forced companies
including Bluestar Adisseo Nutrition Group to delay public
offerings. The Chinese government stepped up measures over the
past two months to contain  inflation  and said on Dec. 3 the
country will shift to a “prudent” monetary policy next year
from a “moderately loose” stance.  Chongqing Bank will be “unique” as it is almost fully
exposed to the Chongqing area while its listed counterparts have
“much higher geographical diversity,”  Mike Werner  and  Wangshu Qiu , Hong Kong-based analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
wrote in a Dec. 7 note.  The lender is scheduled to start trading in Hong Kong on
Dec. 16. Fubon Life Insurance Co., Chow Tai Fook Nominee Ltd.,
Nexus Capital Investing Ltd. and Value Partners Ltd. are among
the institutional investors for the listing, according to the
prospectus.  Faster Growth  The city of  Chongqing , with a population of 32.3 million,
posted average economic growth of 18.2 percent over the past
three years, compared with the national rate of 13.2 percent,
according to government figures.  Chongqing Bank, the ninth and smallest Chinese bank to list
in Hong Kong, was established in June 2008 after the government
merged rural cooperatives in the region. It had 62,000 corporate
and 17.5 million retail customers, according to the prospectus.  The lender, with 1,763 outlets in Chongqing, had 262
billion yuan ($39 billion) of assets as of June 30. The bank
forecast profit of at least 2.85 billion yuan this year, an
increase of 51 percent from 2009. Still, Chongqing Bank’s ratio
of non-performing assets stood at 2.99 percent as of June 30,
the highest among the listed peers.  About 91.5 percent of the stock sold was new shares and 8.5
percent was existing equity from China’s state pension fund.  Companies have raised a record $50 billion from Hong Kong
IPOs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that
include overallotment shares.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
