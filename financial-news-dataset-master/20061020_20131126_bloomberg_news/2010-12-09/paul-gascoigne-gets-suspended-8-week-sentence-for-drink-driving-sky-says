Former England soccer player Paul
Gascoigne was given an eight-week jail sentence, suspended for a
year, for drink driving, the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported.  The 43-year-old admitted driving while four times the
alcohol limit in October. The sentence, including a three-year
driving ban, was imposed by magistrates in Newcastle, northeast
England. He’d been warned he could be jailed for 12 weeks.  Sentencing was adjourned last month after Gascoigne
voluntarily checked himself into a clinic for rehabilitation. He
is also due for trial on a separate drink-drive charge, which he
denies, the BBC reported.  For years Gascoigne has been battling alcoholism and
depression.  The former midfielder, whose last job in soccer was
coaching non-league Kettering in 2005, played 57 games for
England, helping the country reach the semifinals of the 1990
World Cup and Euro 1996. He also had stints at clubs including
Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
