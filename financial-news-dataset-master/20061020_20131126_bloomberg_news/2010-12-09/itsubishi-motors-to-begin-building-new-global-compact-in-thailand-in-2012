Mitsubishi Motors Corp. , maker of the
i-MiEV electric car, plans to invest 16 billion baht ($532
million) in a new Thailand plant where it will begin production
of a global compact model in March 2012.  The Tokyo-based carmaker will produce 150,000 units a year
of the new model, Mitsubishi said in a statement. The company
aims to export the small car to overseas markets including
Europe and Japan, President  Osamu Masuko  told reporters in
Bangkok today.  Mitsubishi is adding the compact as competitors introduce
new small cars to meet rising global demand, especially in
emerging markets.  Toyota Motor Corp. , which began selling its
new Etios compact in India this month, will also make the model
in Thailand, where tax incentives and a population of 67 million
are attracting investments from automakers.  Annual production capacity at Mitsubishi’s third Thai plant
may eventually rise to 200,000 units, the company said. The new
model will be an affordable, fuel-efficient car with a 1- to
1.2-liter engine that will be exported from Thailand, it said.  Mitsubishi  rose 0.9 percent to 117 yen at the 3 p.m. close
in Tokyo. The stock has fallen 8.6 percent this year compared
with a 2.5 percent decline in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Auto production in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s second-
largest economy, surged 76 percent to 1.35 million between
January and October, the Thai Automotive Club, a trade group of
automakers, said on Nov. 17.  Nissan Motor Co.  this year moved Japan production of its
March compact, designed for developed and emerging nations, to
Thailand. Honda Motor Co. and General Motors Co. have also built
plants in the nation, while Ford Motor Co. said in June that it
plans to build a $450 million car factory in Rayong province,
its first wholly owned factory in the country.  The new plant will boost Mitsubishi’s production capacity in
Thailand to 400,000 units a year, Masuko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
