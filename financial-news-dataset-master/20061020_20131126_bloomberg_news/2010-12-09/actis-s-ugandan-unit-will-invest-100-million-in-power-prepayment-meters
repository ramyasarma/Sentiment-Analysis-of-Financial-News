Umeme Ltd. , the Ugandan power
distributor owned by Actis LLP’s Infrastructure 2 Fund, said it
plans to spend $100 million installing prepaid electricity
meters across the country to improve customer services.  The rollout of the meters will start in June after a pilot
project in Kitintale, a suburb of Kampala, is completed,
Charlotte Kemigyisha, a spokeswoman for Umeme, said by phone
today from the capital. Details about the rollout period will be
determined after a meeting with the state-run Electricity
Regulation Authority, she said.  “The system will help us improve customer services and to
manage our expectations instead of waiting for post payments,”
Kemigyisha said.  Umeme connected more than 172,000 new customers in  Uganda 
since it started operations on March 1, 2005, and a further
50,000 customers will be connected in 2011 at a cost of $6
million, the company said in an advert published today in  New
Vision  newspaper. It didn’t give the size of its customer base.  The company plans to invest $32 million in 2011 boosting
new connections, installing prepayment meters and building
substations, according to the statement. Umeme invested $96
million in expanding and refurbishing the nation’s electricity
network since 2005, it said.  Umeme holds a 20-year distribution concession in Uganda
until 2025. CDC Group Plc, an investor in developing countries
that is owned by the U.K. government, is the largest investor in
the Actis fund that owns Umeme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
