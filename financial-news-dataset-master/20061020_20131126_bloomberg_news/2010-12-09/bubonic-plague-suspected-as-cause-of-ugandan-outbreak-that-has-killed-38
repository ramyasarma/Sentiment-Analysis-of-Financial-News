Bubonic plague  is suspected as the
cause of a disease outbreak that has killed 38 people in
northern Uganda in the past month, the Ministry of Health said.  “Plague is not something new in the country,” James
Kakoza, junior health minister, said today by phone from the
capital, Kampala.  The ministry as ruled out Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley,
typhoid and Congo Crimean fevers as the source of the illness,
which was first reported on Nov. 10. The deaths, which took
place up to Dec. 3, are among 91 cases recorded in the six
districts in the north. More recent figures aren’t available,
Kakoza said.  A team of Ugandan health officials and experts from the
U.S.  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention are working
closely to contain the outbreak, Kakoza said. Drugs to treat
bubonic plague are already available in the country because it
has experienced the disease previously, he said.  The ministry said the outbreak is in Acholi, a region
wracked by a two-decade insurgency by the Lord’s Resistance
Army.  Bubonic plague affected the country’s northwestern region
of West Nile in November 2008, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
