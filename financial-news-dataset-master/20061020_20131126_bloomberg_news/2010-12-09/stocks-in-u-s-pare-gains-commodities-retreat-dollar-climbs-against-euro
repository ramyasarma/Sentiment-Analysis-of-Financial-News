U.S.  stocks  pared gains and
commmodities erased an earlier advance as the dollar rallied
against the euro following a downgrade in Ireland’s credit
rating.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.3 percent to
1,231.32 at 10:14 a.m. in New York, trimming an early 0.5
percent advance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated less
than 0.1 percent to 11,367.9 as  DuPont Co . fell after the lower
end of its 2011 earnings forecast trailed analyst estimates. The
euro slumped 0.6 percent to $1.3189 after Fitch Ratings reduced
Ireland’s rating.  The earlier rally in equities and commodities followed
improving data on the U.S., Australian and Japanese economies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
