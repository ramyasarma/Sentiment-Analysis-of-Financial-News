Chevron Corp ., the second-largest
U.S. energy producer, will boost capital spending by 20 percent
to $26 billion next year, devoting more of its budget to finding
and pumping oil and natural gas.  Under the spending program, $22.6 billion, or 87 percent,
of the capital budget will go to exploration and production, the
San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement today.
Another $2.9 billion, or 11 percent, will fund work on its
refineries, pipelines and fuel sales units.  The proportion of its budget Chevron invests in finding and
producing oil and gas, known as the upstream business, has risen
from 77 percent of spending in 2008. Crude oil futures prices
have averaged $78.97 a barrel this year in New York, 27 percent
more than last year’s average price.  “We are more heavily weighted in upstream because the
returns in the sector are stronger over time,”  Kurt Glaubitz , a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  Chevron expects to pump the average equivalent of 2.75
million barrels of crude a day this year, according to company
slides prepared for analysts at a Nov. 11 conference.  The budget includes spending for gas projects in western
Australia and deep-water exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
and Nigeria.  Chevron  rose  51 cents to $86.65 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares, which have 19 buy and
six hold ratings from analysts, have climbed 13 percent this
year.  Exxon Mobil Corp ., based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
