Copper fell in New York on
speculation that an eight-session rally may be overdone, after
prices surged to a record in London before the start of the
first exchange-traded fund backed by industrial metal.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper touched $9,091 a
metric ton, the highest ever, before retreating. ETF Securities
will introduce a fund backed by copper, tin and nickel tomorrow.
 Stockpiles  of copper tracked by the LME fell to 349,450 tons
today, the lowest level since October 2009.  “There is an element of positioning ahead of the launch of
the copper ETF,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “There is a
little bit of profit-taking off the highs.”  Copper futures for March delivery fell 1.45 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.086 a pound at 11:23 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $4.1545, the highest since
reaching a record $4.2605 in May 2008. On the LME, copper for
three-month delivery dropped $59.25, or 0.7 percent, to
$8,955.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
