A South African whitewater guide is
missing and presumed dead after a crocodile attack in Democratic
Republic of Congo, the  International Rescue Committee  said.  Hendrik Coetzee was leading two kayakers down the Lukuga
River in eastern Congo on Dec. 7 when a crocodile pulled him
under water, Ciaran Donnelly, IRC regional director, said today.
IRC evacuated his two companions, Americans Ben Stookesberry and
Chris Korbulic, to a nearby town after the pair called a local
office of the aid agency, Donnelly said.  “They are physically unhurt but quite devastated,”
Donnelly said by phone from Kinshasa, Congo’s capital. The
Americans are completing formalities with Congolese authorities
before returning to their families, Donnelly said.  The three men were part of a team of kayakers documenting
unexplored whitewaters in the region where Congo, Rwanda,
Burundi and Uganda meet. The trip, which was sponsored by U.S.
clothing manufacturer Eddie Bauer Inc., was also meant to bring
attention to the “clean-water crisis” in central Africa,
according to a statement on an Eddie Bauer-affiliated  website 
documenting the trip.  Along the way, the team had visited aid and development
projects managed by IRC, Donnelly said, and were planning to
make a film of their journey.  "We are saddened by the tragic accident and express our
deepest sympathies to Hendri’s family and friends" according to
a statement on the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
