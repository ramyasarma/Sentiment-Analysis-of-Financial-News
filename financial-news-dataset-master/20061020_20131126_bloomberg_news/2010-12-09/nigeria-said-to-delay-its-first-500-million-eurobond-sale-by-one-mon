Nigeria may delay plans to sell its
first $500 million Eurobond until next month, according to a
government official who declined to be identified as he is not
authorized to speak on the issue.  The roadshow and the pricing of the bond may take place in
January, as opposed to December as planned, the official said,
citing market sentiment for the delay. Citigroup Inc. Chief
Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said in Lagos yesterday he
expected to see “significant demand” for the Eurobond from
developed and emerging markets.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and top oil
producer, plans to use the Eurobond as a benchmark for local
companies to price their bonds and to fund development projects,
Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga  said on Sept. 3. The country
last month appointed Citigroup and Deutsche Bank AG to act as
bookrunners for the issue, while Barclays Capital and FBN
Capital Ltd. were named advisers.  “It’s a good idea to postpone,” Simon Willet, head of
sales at CSL Stockbrokers Ltd., a unit of Lagos-based First City
Monument Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview. “Fund
managers are closing their books for the year.”  Abraham Nwankwo , director-general of Nigeria’s Debt
Management Office, said on Nov. 2 that the sale would be
concluded by the middle of December.  Nigeria announced plans for the sale in September 2008. The
issue was postponed in March last year because of the global
financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
