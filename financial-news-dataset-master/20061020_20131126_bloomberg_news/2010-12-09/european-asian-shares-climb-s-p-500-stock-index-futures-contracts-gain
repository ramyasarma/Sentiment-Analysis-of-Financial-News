Europe’s benchmark stock index rose
to a two-year high, Asian stocks climbed and U.S.-index futures
gained as reports reassured investors that the global economic
recovery is intact.  ASML Holding NV advanced 6.4 percent after the company
raised its forecast for bookings in the fourth quarter.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest publicly
traded bank, and Westpac Banking Group Ltd., Australia’s second-
largest bank by market value, climbed on better-than-estimated
economic growth in Japan and a rise in Australian employment.   The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.6 percent to 276.49 at
8:04 a.m. in London, the highest since September 2008, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 1 percent. Contracts on the S&P
500 Index expiring this month climbed 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
