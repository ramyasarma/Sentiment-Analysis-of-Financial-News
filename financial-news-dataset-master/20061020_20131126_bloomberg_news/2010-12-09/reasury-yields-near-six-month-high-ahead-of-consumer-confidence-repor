Treasury yields were near a six-
month high before a U.S. report that economists said will show
consumer confidence rose in December, adding to signs the
world’s largest economy is picking up.  Benchmark 10-year  notes  headed for a second weekly loss
after data yesterday showed fewer American workers filed first-
time claims for unemployment benefits. Thirty-year  bonds  were
also poised to decline for a second week after President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 6 agreed to extend tax cuts for two years,
potentially widening the budget deficit.  “Better data means that people are starting to revise up
their growth forecasts for the U.S. economy for next year,”
said  Khoon Goh , head of market economics and strategy in
Wellington at ANZ National Bank Ltd., New Zealand’s largest
lender. “I definitely expect U.S. yields to push higher still
from here.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose one basis point to 3.21
percent at 10:09 a.m. in Tokyo, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 2.625 percent security due November 2020 fell
1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 95 1/32. The yield
climbed to 3.33 percent on Dec. 8, the highest since June 4.  The 30-year yield was at 4.40 percent, after touching 4.50
percent on Dec. 8, the most since May 13. The 10-year yield may
advance to 3.25 percent by year-end, Goh said.  The yield on the 10-year note will end next year at 3.53
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of banks and securities companies, with the most recent
estimates given the heaviest weightings.  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of  consumer sentiment  rose to 72.5 in December from 71.6
in November, according to a Bloomberg News survey before today’s
report. Applications for  jobless benefits  fell to 421,000 last
week, less than the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, from a revised 438,000 the prior week, the Labor
Department said yesterday.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, raised its forecast for U.S. growth
next year as policy makers pump a “massive amount” of stimulus
into the economy, Chief Executive Officer  Mohamed El-Erian  said
in a telephone interview yesterday from his office in Newport
Beach, California.  Pimco sees the economy growing 3 percent to 3.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of next year from the same period of this
year. That compares with its previous estimate for 2 percent to
2.5 percent growth, and the 2.2 percent gain forecast for this
year by the International Monetary Fund.  Two-Day Slump  Ten-year notes had their biggest two-day slump this week
since September 2008 following Obama’s deal to prolong all Bush-
era tax cuts in exchange for extending federal unemployment
insurance and cutting the payroll tax. The 10-year yield rose 35
basis points from Dec. 7 to 8, the largest such gain since Sept.
19, 2008, when markets were in upheaval after the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  “Economic data started printing stronger and tax cuts were
set to be extended, so rates were forced higher in a pain
trade,” analysts led by  Bulent Baygun , New York-based head of
interest-rate strategy at BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a research
note yesterday. Seasonal factors “suggest a risk of a further
sell-off into year-end,” the report said.  The Federal Reserve bought $8.309 billion of Treasuries
maturing in 2016 and 2017 yesterday. The central bank will
announce its plans for the next round of debt buying at 2 p.m.
in Washington, according to its  website . It plans to purchase
$600 billion of Treasuries by June to cap borrowing costs.  U.S. government debt has handed investors a 5.8 percent
return this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Japanese bonds have gained 1.1 percent, and German
bunds have risen 6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
