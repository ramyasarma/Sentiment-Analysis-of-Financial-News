     Dec. 10 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose, completing a
second-straight weekly gain, as financial and telecommunications
companies advanced after Canadian and U.S. exports increased and
BCE Inc. boosted its quarterly dividend.  BCE, Canada’s biggest phone company, advanced 2.9 percent
after raising its  dividend  by 7.7 percent. First Quantum
Minerals Ltd., the country’s second-largest publicly traded
copper producer, climbed 9.6 percent as China’s imports rose to
a record. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s fourth-
largest insurer, surged 5.7 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  gained 72.53
points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,239.47 at 4:15 p.m. in Toronto.
The Canadian benchmark advanced 0.5 percent this week after U.S.
President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans agreed to
extend tax cuts due to expire Dec. 31.  “It’s a continuing effect of the Bush tax cuts that have
been extended,” said  Todd Johnson , who helps oversee C$230
million ($228 million) as a money manager at BCV Asset
Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba. “The market was starting to
price in that nothing would get done, but Obama’s definitely
shifted to a bit more of a pro-growth stance, and I think the
market’s viewed that positively.”  The index is performing better than the S&P 500 for the
seventh straight year, boosted by raw-material producers. The
growth of the Chinese economy helped spur copper to a 24 percent
gain through yesterday, while concern over the safety of
government debt led gold to a 25 percent jump.  Metal User  Chinese imports rose 38 percent last month from November
2009, the country’s customs bureau said today. China is the
world’s biggest user of industrial metals.  Canada’s trade deficit narrowed more in October than all 24
economists in a  Bloomberg survey  forecast as metal exports
surged 18 percent from September, Statistics Canada said today.
The U.S. today reported the smallest trade gap since January as
exports advanced to a 26-month high.  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  increased for a fourth day.
Manulife rallied 5.7 percent to C$16.89. Financial holding
company Power Corp. of Canada, climbed 1 percent to C$27.90.
National Bank of Canada, the country’s sixth-largest bank, rose
1 percent to a record C$70.22.  “You have interest rates starting to move higher this
week,” Johnson said. “This week is a pretty seminal event.
Manulife is positively levered to the normalization of the
interest-rate cycle.”  Rising Rate  The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries increased 0.31
percentage points this week, the biggest weekly gain in more
than a month.  Canada’s dollar slipped the most in four weeks versus its
U.S. counterpart as investors bet interest rates will remain on
hold until late next year after the central bank said it will be
careful about future rate boosts.  The currency reversed last week’s gain as the Bank of
Canada kept the benchmark overnight lending rate at 1 percent
for a second consecutive meeting and underlined threats to the
economic recovery from falling exports and Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  The largest base-metals producers gained as copper
advanced. First Quantum increased 9.6 percent to its highest
price ever of C$118.94. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest
base-metals and coal producer, climbed 4.1 percent to C$57.90.  Gold companies fell as the metal dropped on a stronger U.S.
dollar. Goldcorp Inc., the world’s second-largest gold producer
by market value, declined 0.6 percent to C$46.50.  Production Forecast  Harry Winston Diamond Corp. sank 13 percent to C$12.62
after lowering its 2010 production estimate by 12 percent. The
company also forecast 2011 production 31 percent below the
estimate of Bank of Montreal analysts.  BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, rose 2.9 percent to a 24-
month high of C$36.09 after boosting its quarterly dividend to
49.25 cents a share. The company also increased its 2010 profit
forecast by 1.8 percent to reflect a tax deduction for a C$750
million ($742 million) voluntary pension contribution.  Forzani Group Ltd. jumped 12 percent to C$17.64, the
biggest gain since November 2008. Canada’s largest sporting-
goods retailer reported third-quarter  earnings  that beat the
average analyst estimate by 12 percent, excluding certain items.
The company also said same-store sales gained 16 percent in the
first five weeks of the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story;
