EBay Inc. ’s PayPal business took
steps today to guard against an attack from computer hackers
trying to bring down the site after it cut off funding for
WikiLeaks, the organization that publishes secret documents.  PayPal has temporarily strengthened the vetting process for
new developers who want to build on PayPal’s software code, the
payment-processing company said in an e-mailed statement.  “We have taken this temporary action to focus on
maintaining business as usual for our millions of active PayPal
customers, merchants and developers,” Anuj Nayar, a spokesman
for PayPal, said in a statement. “We apologize for any
inconvenience.”  Hackers have taken steps to harm companies, including
PayPal, that have cut off WikiLeaks’ access to their services.
Supporters of WikiLeaks, which disseminated classified U.S.
military and State Department documents over the Web, failed to
bring down Amazon.com Inc. this morning and instead turned their
attention to PayPal. The attacks may have limited impact, said
 Scott Kessler , an analyst at Standard & Poor’s.  “You will see them taking hold for a few hours at most,”
said Kessler, who’s based in New York. “These companies are
generally speaking well prepared to handle these types of
attacks.”  PayPal, based in San Jose,  cut off  WikiLeaks last week for
violating policies of the online payment processor. Seattle-
based Amazon, which has hosted the site on its servers, also
kicked WikiLeaks off last week.  New Target  “We have changed our target” to PayPal after the attack on
Amazon faltered, according to a post on  Twitter  from a group
that says it represents the hackers.  An unidentified member of the group said in an e-mailed
statement that it “shares ideals” with WikiLeaks, and that,
“some day we will attack successfully Amazon.” The group has no
new targets, according to the e-mail.  PayPal’s site had experienced attacks but was not breached,
Nayar said.  Craig Berman , a spokesman for Amazon, declined to
comment.  MasterCard Inc., the world’s second-biggest payments
processor, said yesterday its website was slowed by a flood of
traffic after it blocked use of its network by WikiLeaks.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is working with
companies to limit damage to websites that were targets of the
attacks, according to a government official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
