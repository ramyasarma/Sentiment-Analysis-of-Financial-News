China’s stocks  fell, driving the
benchmark index down to the lowest in almost two months, as
inflation concerns and a think-tank report saying property
prices are inflated boosted prospects for more policy tightening.  China Vanke Co.  and  Poly Real Estate Group Co.  slid more
than 3 percent after the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said
new homes in major cities are “overpriced” by an average of 30
percent. SAIC Motor Corp. and Chongqing Brewery Co. paced a
retreat for consumer companies after Morgan Stanley said it
recommended investors “underweight” the industry on valuations.  “For the short- and medium-term, the market is going to
fluctuate with downward pressure as it’s a policy-driven
market,” said  Zhou Xi , a strategist at Bohai Securities Co. in
Tianjin. “Investors are prepared to see a higher or even peak
inflation rate for November.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 37.60 points, or 1.3 percent, to
2,810.95 at the 3 p.m. close, the lowest since Oct. 11.  The CSI
300 Index  fell 1.5 percent to 3,123.37.  Yesterday’s move by the statistics bureau to bring forward
the release of economic data, including inflation, to Dec. 11
instead of Dec. 13 signal an interest-rate increase may be
imminent, said  Glenn Maguire , chief Asia economist at Societe
Generale SA.  A gauge of developers  on the Shanghai Composite fell 1.8
percent, the most since Nov. 26. China Vanke, the nation’s
largest developer, lost 3.8 percent to 8.17 yuan. Poly retreated
4.5 percent to 12.13 yuan.  Property Prices  Prices of new properties in Fuzhou in the southeastern
seaboard province of Fujian were the most inflated, the Shanghai
Daily reported, citing the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’
annual housing report. New homes in seven out of the 35 cities
were more than 50 percent overpriced, according to the report.  The Shanghai gauge has lost 11 percent since reaching a
high on Nov. 8, extending this year’s loss to 14 percent, on
concern tighter monetary policy will slow growth in the world’s
fastest growing major economy.  Bank of Beijing Co. fell 2.7 percent to 1.57 yuan today and
Huaxia Bank Co. declined 2.2 percent to 10.91 yuan. China
Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second largest lender,
slipped 1.7 percent to 4.70.  China’s reserve ratio for the nation’s biggest lenders may
rise to 20 percent next year from 18.5 percent currently,
 Maguire  said in Hong Kong today. Banks were asked to set aside
larger reserves twice last month after inflation reached 4.4
percent in October, the most since September 2008. China also
raised borrowing costs in October for the first time since 2007
to cut money supply in the banking system.  Inflation Outlook  This coming weekend’s inflation data may show consumer
prices climbed 4.7 percent in November, according to the median
estimate of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices may have
climbed between 5 percent and 5.2 percent last month, according
to a research note from Sinolink Securities Co.  A gauge of consumer staples  declined 2.1 percent on the CSI
300. The gauge trades at 41.4 times reported earnings, compared
with 18.5 times for the broader measure. An index tracking
consumer discretionary companies dropped 2.5 percent.  Morgan Stanley has an “underweight” position on consumer-
related stocks because of “high” valuations and earnings
expectations, according to yesterday’s report by analysts led by
 Jerry Lou . Investors should switch to so-called cyclical stocks,
such as banks, developers, steelmakers and energy producers,
they said.  SAIC lost 3.2 percent to 15.99 yuan before the release of
November auto sales. Chongqing Brewery, partly owned by
Carlsberg A/S, fell 10 percent to 56.97 yuan.  Rail Boost  China Railway Group Ltd. and China CNR Corp. led gains by
rail-related stocks as investors speculated the world high-speed
rail congress in Beijing will spur new orders.  China Railway Group, the nation’s biggest construction
company by total assets, rallied 5.9 percent to 4.65 yuan. China
CNR rose 5.2 percent to 7.09 yuan. CSR Corp. jumped 7.3 percent
to 8.25 yuan. CNR and CSR are the country’s two biggest railcar
makers.  “With big orders for high-speed railways at home and
abroad, railway-related companies are one of the few sectors
with solid growth prospects against a backdrop of an uncertain
macro-economic environment,” said  Wu Kan , Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.  The country formed ventures with Alstom SA and Bombardier
Inc. this week to help develop new rail systems. The government
plans to spend as much as 4 trillion yuan ($600 billion)
expanding rail coverage, the China Securities Journal reported
yesterday, citing an unidentified person.  -- Irene Shen . Editor:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
