Toshiba Corp.’s production of NAND
flash memory chips at a plant in Yokkaichi, central Japan, has
been disrupted since yesterday by a problem at a local power
plant, the company said.   The power outage, which occurred at 5:21 a.m. yesterday,
could cause planned shipments in January and February to fall by
as much as 20 percent, according to Hiroki Yamazaki, a spokesman
at the Tokyo-based company. Almost 100 percent of the factory’s
equipment should be back on line sometime tomorrow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
