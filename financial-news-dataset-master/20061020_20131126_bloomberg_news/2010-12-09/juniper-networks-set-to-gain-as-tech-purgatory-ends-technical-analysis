Technology shares are likely to lead
U.S. equities higher over the next two years, and  Juniper
Networks Inc.  appears poised to be among the best performers,
according to Royal Bank of Canada.  “Technology is emerging after five-plus years of technical
purgatory,”  Robert Sluymer , a technical market analyst at the
bank’s RBC Capital Markets Inc. unit in New York, wrote in a
report today. The 75 makers of computer hardware and software
and semiconductors in the S&P 500 account for 19 percent of its
 market value , the most among 10 industries.  Juniper Networks, the second-largest U.S. maker of computer
networking equipment after Cisco Systems Inc., “is poised to
break out of a multiyear trading range,” Sluymer wrote. RBC
expects economic and  earnings growth  to fuel gains in stock
prices next year. Technology stocks, out of favor for years
following their collapse from 2000 to 2002, are “increasingly
showing technical evidence of becoming a leadership theme
through 2012,” Sluymer wrote.  Energy stocks  led the S&P 500’s advance from March 2003 to
October 2007, more than tripling as a group while the index rose
88 percent. Technology shares gained 97 percent, less than five
of the index’s 10 industries. Since the end of 2008, technology
stocks in the S&P 500 have gained 74 percent, more than double
the 36 percent return for the index.  “In contrast to the last bull cycle, where technology only
participated for a first couple of quarters, in this cycle we
believe technology will participate strongly,” Sluymer said in
an interview.  Juniper Networks, which declined 16 percent from the end of
2004 through June 30 compared with a 15 percent drop for the S&P
500, has risen 53 percent through yesterday, more than twice the
index’s 19 percent advance. The company is his top
recommendation for 2011.  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.  was Sluymer’s top
recommendation for 2010. The world’s second-largest network-
security company gained 32 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 10 percent advance by the S&P 500 and an 8.7
percent gain for its technology stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
