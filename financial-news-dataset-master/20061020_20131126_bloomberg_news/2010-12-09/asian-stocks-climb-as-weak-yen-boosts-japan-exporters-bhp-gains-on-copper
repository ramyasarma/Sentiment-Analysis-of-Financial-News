Asian stocks  gained, driving the
benchmark index to its sixth advance in seven days, as reports
on better-than-estimated economic growth in Japan and employment
in Australia bolstered confidence in a regional recovery.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded bank, climbed 3.7 percent.  Westpac Banking Group
Ltd. , Australia’s second-largest bank by market value, rose 2.4
percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
gained 1.3 percent in Sydney after copper futures surged to a
record yesterday in New York. Chimei Innolux Corp. led declines
by Taiwanese flat-panel makers following European Union fines.  “Asia’s growth momentum remains intact,” said  Pauline Dan ,
Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Samsung Investment
Trust, which oversees about $72 billion in assets. “There are
still a lot of uncertainties out there. Monetary tightening in
China will remain a key risk into next year, along with
geopolitical risks and issues concerning European debt.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 1 percent to 133.63 as of
5:10 p.m. in Tokyo, with five stocks advancing for every four

inflation measures, Europe’s debt crisis and tensions on the
Korean peninsula may cool a global economic recovery.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  advanced 0.5 percent.

4.1 percent expansion.  Australian Jobs  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.9 percent. The

statistics bureau said today. That compares with the median

percent a month earlier.  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1.7 percent, the biggest
increase among benchmark equity indexes in the Asia-Pacific
region, and China’s Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.3 percent,
the biggest decrease. Taiwan’s Taiex Index advanced 0.6 percent
and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.3 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.5
percent today. The index rose 0.4 percent yesterday to a two-
year high, buoyed by a possible extension of U.S. tax cuts and
after American International Group Inc. said it will repay a
credit line to the Federal Reserve.  Financials Advance  Financial companies  had the second-biggest advance among
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups, following
information-technology shares. Mitsubishi UFJ increased 3.7

Japan’s No. 2 bank, rose 3.5 percent to 2,712 yen.  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. , the No. 3, climbed 2.9 percent to 141 yen.  “Investors already knew that higher capital spending in
the July-September period would boost Japan’s GDP, but they took
it as a good direction once the result was disclosed,” said
 Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion as chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  In Sydney, Westpac Banking gained 2.4 percent to A$22.29.

liquid-crystal-display screens by sales, increased 3.2 percent

maker of notebook computers by shipments, increased 4.1 percent
to NT$63.4 after saying November sales rose 12 percent from a
