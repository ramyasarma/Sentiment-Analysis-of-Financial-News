OeBB Holding AG, Austria’s state-
owned railway system, won’t order 16  Siemens AG  Railjet trains,
the third tranche of an older deal, because it can’t afford the
investment, Austrian daily newspaper Kurier reported today.  OeBB Chief Executive Christian Kern told Kurier in an
interview that he was in talks with Siemens about the order
cancellation, which he says is worth 250 million to 260 million
euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
