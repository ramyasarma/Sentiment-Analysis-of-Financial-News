Tokyo’s office vacancy rate rose for
the first time in three months in November as some companies
reduced office space, said  Miki Shoji Co.  Property stocks fell.  The measure of unoccupied office units rose to 9.04 percent
from 8.85 percent in October, according to the Tokyo-based
privately held office brokerage company.  The  Topix Real Estate Index , measuring 44 property-related
stocks, declined 0.6 percent at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.3
percent.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. , Japan’s biggest developer, lost 1.5
percent to 1,504 yen, after rising as much as 0.3 percent. Its
rival  Mitsubishi Estate Co.  shed 0.4 percent to 1,438 yen,
reversing an earlier gain of 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
