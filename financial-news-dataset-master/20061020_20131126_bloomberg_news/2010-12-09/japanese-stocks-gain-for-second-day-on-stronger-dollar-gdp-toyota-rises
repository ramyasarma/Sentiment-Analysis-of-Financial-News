Japanese  stocks  gained, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to almost a seven-month high, as
Japan’s economy grew faster than expected and the euro
strengthened against the yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded bank, rose 3.7 percent. Nomura Holdings Inc.,
the nation’s biggest brokerage, climbed 3.9 percent. T&D
Holdings Inc., a life insurer, jumped 4.4 percent. Honda Motor
Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad,
advanced 1.6 percent. Fanuc Ltd., the nation’s largest maker of
industrial robots, gained 1.2 percent as Japanese companies
increased capital spending.  “Investors already knew that higher capital spending in the
July-September period would boost Japan’s GDP, but they took it
as a good direction once the result was disclosed,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion as chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Stable
currency movements are gradually bolstering investors’
confidence about the economic future.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 0.5 percent to
10,285.88 at the close in Tokyo, the highest since May 14. The
broader Topix rose 0.5 percent to 891.60, with about eight
shares rising for every seven that fell. The  Nikkei 225  formed a
so-called golden cross, indicating the gauge may climb 11
percent back to this year’s April high within the next quarter,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  Golden Cross  The Nikkei’s 25-day moving average surpassed the 200-day
moving average today to complete the golden cross, which is
considered by chart watchers to be a bullish signal. The event
last occurred in June 2009. The Nikkei’s high this year was on
April 5, when it closed at 11,339.30 and it may rise back to
that level in the quarter ending March, said  Shoichiro Yamauchi ,
a technical analyst at Nomura.  The Nikkei 225 has tumbled 9.3 percent from its high this
year on April 5 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb
property prices and concern about U.S. economic growth damped
confidence in a global recovery. Stocks in the index trade at 18
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  gained 3.7 percent to 417
yen, and its closest rival Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.
climbed 3.5 percent to 2,712 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s third-biggest bank, rose 2.9 percent to 141 yen. The
three lenders were the  largest contributors  to the Topix’s gain.  GDP Beats Estimates  Gross domestic product  grew at an annualized 4.5 percent
rate in the three months ended Sept. 30, faster than the 3.9
percent reported last month, the Cabinet Office said today in
Tokyo. The median forecast of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 4.1 percent expansion.  Capital investment in the third quarter advanced 1.3
percent from the previous three months, more than the 0.8
percent increase in the preliminary report, today’s data showed.  Nomura Holdings rallied 3.9 percent to 509 yen. Daiwa
Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest brokerage, leapt
3.3 percent to 403 yen. T&D, a life insurer, jumped 4.4 percent
to 2,079 yen, the highest since June 4. Dai-Ichi Life Co.,
Japan’s second-biggest life insurer, soared 5.6 percent to
130,700 yen.  Banks, insurers and brokerages  contributed the most  to the
gain of the Topix among its 33 industry groups, followed by
makers of cars and electronics.  Exporters Gain  Honda, Japan’s second-largest automaker, advanced 1.6
percent to 3,185 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
car exporter, jumped 2.9 percent to 247 yen. Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that earns almost 80 percent of its sales overseas,
climbed 1.2 percent to 825 yen.  Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots that earns about 80
percent of revenue overseas, rose 1.2 percent to 12,590 yen,
contributing the most to the Nikkei 225’s gain. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, increased 0.7 percent to 4,115 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 111.57 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 110.92 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  “Investors’ risk tolerance toward Japanese stocks is
rising because the yen has been weakening,” said  Gentoku Kiyokawa , operating officer at BNP Paribas Investment Partners
in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
