Facebook Inc., owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking site, was asked by South Korea’s
telecommunications regulator to improve privacy policies to
better protect users of the service in the country.  Facebook is “inadequate” in notifying users about how
personal information is collected and in getting their consent
for its use, the  Korea Communications Commission  said in a
statement yesterday. Should Facebook offer personal information
to a third party, it needs to notify users of the purpose and
the period in which the details will be used, it said.  Facebook received a letter from the commission and would
“welcome a dialogue” with the regulator to discuss privacy
practices, according to an e-mailed statement by the Palo Alto,
California-based company today.  “Since the beginning of the company, we have continued to
adapt our privacy practices to ensure that people have access to
simple, easy-to use privacy settings and that our privacy policy
is transparent,” Facebook said in the statement.  The commission also asked Facebook, which has about 2.32
million users in South Korea, to submit documentation on how it
uses personal information for customized advertising and whether
it’s complying with measures to protect personal information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
