China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Co., the nation’s largest oil trading company, hired
two traders of West African crude to work at its London office,
said two people with knowledge of the appointments.  Bill Chalker from Chevron Corp. and Mark Tattersdill from
Statoil ASA will join the London-based unit of Unipec, as the
company is known, next year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Oerjan Heradstveit, a Statoil spokesman in Stavanger,
Norway, said today that Tattersdill is leaving the company.
Nobody replied to a message left on a voicemail at Unipec’s
office in London.  Ruth Kent , a Chevron spokeswoman in London,
also declined to comment.  Unipec is the trading arm of China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. or Sinopec, the country’s biggest refiner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
