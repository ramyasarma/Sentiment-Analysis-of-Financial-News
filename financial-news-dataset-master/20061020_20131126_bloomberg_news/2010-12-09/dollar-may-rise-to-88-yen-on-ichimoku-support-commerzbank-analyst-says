The dollar may strengthen to 88 yen
after finding support indicated by ichimoku chart analysis,
Commerzbank AG said.  “Dollar-yen continues to recover after testing support at
82.32, the nine-day base line, known as the kinsen,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and currency technical
analysis at Commerzbank in London, said in an interview today.
“Kinsen support comes in at 82.48 today. There’s also support
at 82.31, the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the move down
from May.”  That area represents “a near-term base, reinforced by the
ichimoku cloud,” Jones said.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
conversion line plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low
over the last nine trading days. The baseline is the same
calculation over the past 26 days.  The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 83.95 yen at 10:07 a.m.
in London. It last reached 88 yen on Sept. 28.  “Dollar-yen is still above the ichimoku cloud, and our
longer-term outlook remains positive,” Jones said. “Our
targets are the September high at 85.94, then the 200-day moving
average around 87.48 before 88.00, a major pivot point.”  The cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart and is used to show an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is
based on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain
percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
