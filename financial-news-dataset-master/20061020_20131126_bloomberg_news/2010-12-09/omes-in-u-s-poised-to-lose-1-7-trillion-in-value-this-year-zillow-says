U.S. home values are poised to drop
by more than $1.7 trillion this year amid rising foreclosures
and the expiration of homebuyer tax credits, said Zillow Inc., a
closely held provider of home price data.  This year’s estimated decline, more than the $1.05 trillion
drop in 2009, brings the loss since the June 2006 home-price
peak to $9 trillion, the Seattle-based company said today in a
statement.  “It’s definitely going to continue into 2011,” Stan
Humphries, Zillow’s chief economist, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television today. “The back half of 2010 looked
horrible and 2011 should look like the mirror image of that.”  The drop in home values pushed more buyers underwater,
meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are
worth, Zillow said. The percentage of homeowners with mortgages
with so-called negative equity reached 23.2 percent in the third
quarter, up from 21.8 percent at the end of 2009.  Housing demand has slumped since the start of the year as
the government tax credit expired and unemployment hovers near
10 percent. Sales of  existing homes  in October fell to an annual
pace of 4.43 million, compared with 5.98 million a year earlier
and an annual average of 5.81 million over the past decade, the
National Association of Realtors said Nov. 23. The median price
was $170,500, down from $172,000 a year earlier.  Prices are likely to stop falling in the second half of
next year and take another three to five years before making
strong gains, he said.  “We think appreciation will be after 2014, essentially,”
Humphries said.  Tax Credits End  More than $1 trillion of this year’s decline in home values
occurred in the second half, Zillow said. Federal tax credits of
as much as $8,000 for qualified first-time homebuyers and $6,500
for repeat buyers required a sales contract by April 30.  Only 31 metropolitan areas, or fewer than one-fourth of the
129 tracked by Zillow, had gains in home values this year. They
include Boston and San Diego.  Zillow’s findings contrast with reports by the  Federal
Housing Finance Agency , the S&P/Case-Shiller  index  and the
National Association of Realtors, which show home prices found a
floor in early 2009, said  Walter Molony , a spokesman for the
Realtors group.  “We are projecting essentially no change in values from
2009 and view Zillow’s estimates as completely wrong,” he said
in an e-mail.  Weak Demand  U.S. home prices will decline as much as 11 percent by 2012
as weak demand and rising inventory extend the housing slump,
Morgan Stanley said in a report yesterday.  Prices  will be as much as 36 percent below their 2006 peak
before finding a bottom, Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Oliver Chang  wrote. Sales will stay “depressed” through next year
amid tightened lending standards, they said.  As many as 8 million homes are in some stage of default or
foreclosure, known as shadow inventory, and may be offered for
sale over the next five years, according to Morgan Stanley. The
looming supply will combine with tight credit and questions
about housing-finance regulation to reduce prices 6 percent to
11 percent from current levels, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
