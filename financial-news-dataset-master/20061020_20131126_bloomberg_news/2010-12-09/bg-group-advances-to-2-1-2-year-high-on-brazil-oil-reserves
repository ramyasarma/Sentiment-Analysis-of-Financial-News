BG Group Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest energy producer, rose to a 2 1/2 year high after saying
its share of the initial phase of Brazil’s Tupi and Guara fields
will be about 600 million barrels of oil equivalent.  BG advanced as much as 3.4 percent to 1,331 pence in London
trading, the highest since May 27, 2008. The shares were 30.5
pence higher at 1,318 pence as of 9:45 a.m. local time,
extending their gain for the year to 17 percent.  The first two floating production, storage and offloading
vessels, or FPSOs, on the Tupi field as well as another at Guara
field will have a combined daily pumping capacity of about
340,000 barrels of oil and 531 million standard cubic feet of
gas. The first unit at Tupi started in October, while the other
two vessels are expected to come online in 2013, BG said today
in a statement.  Reading, England-based BG in November increased estimates
for gross energy resources at the Tupi, Iracema, and Guara
fields in the Santos Basin by 34 percent to 10.8 billion barrels
of oil equivalent. Last month, BG and its partners signed a $3.5
billion contract to order hulls for eight more FPSOs for the
full development of the Brazilian fields.  The three FPSOs will recover total gross reserves of around
2.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, BG said.  BG said it anticipates “very low” unit technical costs
for the initial phase given the “outstanding reservoir
characteristics and high recovery per well.”  It forecast capital costs of $5 and operating costs of $9 a
barrel of oil equivalent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
