Cattle prices in eastern Australia
increased to a five-year high as rains reduced livestock numbers
at sales while demand remained strong from producers rebuilding
herds, Meat & Livestock Australia Economist Tim McRae said by
phone today.  The eastern young cattle indicator reached A$3.86 per
kilogram yesterday, the highest level since October 2005, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
