Airports in Frankfurt and Berlin
reported extensive flight cancellations today due to heavy
winter weather in parts of Europe.  Fraport AG’s Frankfurt airport has had 415 flights
cancelled so far today, spokesman Thomas Uber said by telephone,
adding that the runways were fully usable and that many
cancellations were due to flights not receiving clearance
involving other airports where the weather has caused capacity
restrictions.  Some problems were also being experienced at Frankfurt
because of after-effects from the closure of the airport for
several hours for snow clearance overnight, he said.  In Berlin, about a third of scheduled flights were
cancelled at Schoenefeld and Tegel, airport operator Flughafen
Berlin-Schönefeld GmbH said in a statement, citing a “domino
effect” caused by problems at other airports.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
