Harel Freres Ltd. , which produces 75
percent of Mauritius’s processed sugar, expects its shareholders
to approve a merger with Saint Andre Sugar Estate Co. tomorrow,
Louis Denis Koenig, the company secretary, said.  The Port Louis-based company intends to pay 470 million
rupees ($15.3 million) in shares and cash for St Andre, Koenig
said in an interview on Dec. 1.  “We expect that the appropriate majority of shareholders
will approve the project,” he said.  For each share held, St Andre shareholders will receive
1,065 Harel Freres shares and 3,100 rupees, Harel Freres said on
Oct. 21.  The deal will allow better use of land without affecting
sugar cane production, Koenig said. “The best agricultural land
will be used for sugar cane growing whilst less productive land
will be put to more profitable alternative use,” he said.  The combined company will own about 7,000 hectares (17,300
acres) of land, of which 450 hectares have conversion rights for
real estate and commercial development, Koenig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
