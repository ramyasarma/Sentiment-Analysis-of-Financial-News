South African  manufacturing  output
grew at a faster pace in October than the previous month, as
lower interest rates and a rebound in exports fueled production.  Factory output, which accounts for 15 percent of the
economy, increased 2.5 percent after expanding a revised 1.3
percent in September, Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa 
said on its website today. The median estimate of 14 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg was 1.9 percent.  Output  rose a seasonally
adjusted 1.2 percent in the month.  The Reserve Bank has cut its key  interest rate  three times
to 5.5 percent this year, the lowest level in three decades, to
help spur consumer spending in Africa’s biggest economy.
Manufacturing growth is still subdued, limiting economic growth
to 2.6 percent in the third quarter and 2.8 percent in the
second, the statistics office said on Nov. 23.  “The recovery has been fragile, with disappointing growth
despite the boost from the FIFA World Cup” that was hosted by
South Africa in the month through July 11, central bank Governor
 Gill Marcus  said yesterday. Growth in private-sector investment
“remains extremely subdued.”  Manufacturing output may strengthen further after the
 Purchasing Managers Index  rose above 50 in November, indicating
an expansion in factory production, Kagiso Securities Ltd. said
on Dec. 1. The recovery is being hampered by the rand, which has
gained 11 percent against the dollar since June 1, reducing the
competitiveness of exports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
