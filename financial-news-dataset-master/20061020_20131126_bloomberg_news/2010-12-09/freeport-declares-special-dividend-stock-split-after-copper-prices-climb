Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ,
the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, will pay a
$1-a-share special dividend for a total payout of about $471
million after the price of the industrial metal rose.  The supplemental dividend will be paid on Dec. 30 to
shareholders of record as of Dec. 20, the Phoenix-based company
said today in a statement. Freeport’s board also approved a two-
for-one split of the company’s common stock that will take
effect in February.  “Authorization of this supplemental dividend reflects the
strong current cash position and significant cash flows being
generated by our global operations,” Chief Executive Officer
 Richard Adkerson  said in the statement.  Adkerson has sought to exploit rising copper prices by
increasing output at mines that had seen production cuts last
year and in 2008 as the global economic slowdown reduced demand.
Copper futures closed at a record in New York yesterday on
speculation that demand will outpace production as a global
recovery sparks construction of new homes and appliances.  The company said in October it would increase its annual
 dividend  to $2 a share from $1.20.  Freeport rose $2.06, or 1.9 percent, to $110.66 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares 
have gained 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
