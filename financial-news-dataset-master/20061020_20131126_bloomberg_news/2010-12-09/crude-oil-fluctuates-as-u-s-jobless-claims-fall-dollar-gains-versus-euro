Crude edged higher as a decline in
U.S. jobless claims bolstered optimism the economic recovery in
the world’s biggest oil-consuming country remains on track.  Oil climbed 9 cents after the Labor Department said
applications for  unemployment benefits  declined 17,000 to
421,000. Futures came off their highs as the dollar advanced on
a Fitch Ratings downgrade of Ireland’s credit standing, curbing
the appeal of commodities.  “The U.S. jobless numbers are cause for some holiday
cheer,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “They are a
signal that the economic recovery will gather strength and fuel
demand will rebound.”  Crude oil for January delivery settled at $88.37 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract traded between
$87.71 and $89.42 today. Prices are up 25 percent from a year
ago.  Brent crude oil for January settlement rose 22 cents to
$90.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The four-week  moving average  of jobless claims, a less-
volatile measure, dropped to 421,000, the lowest level in more
than two years. Economists forecast last week’s filings would
fall to 425,000, according to the median of 50 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
fell by 191,000 in the week ended Nov. 27 to 4.09 million. They
were forecast to fall to 4.24 million.  European Debt Crisis  Fitch said in a report today that the euro region’s debt
crisis has “escalated beyond the point that it can be
contained” by individual bailouts. The European Union and the
International Monetary Fund approved an 85 billion-euro ($113
billion) rescue for Ireland on Nov. 28, seven months after a 110
billion-euro bailout for Greece.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the
euro, yen and pound, rose 0.1 percent to 80.061. The dollar
increased 0.2 percent to $1.3235 per euro, up from $1.3262
yesterday.  Oil climbed earlier, following gasoline, after Hovensa LLC
shut a fuel-making unit for unplanned repairs at its Saint Croix
refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  “The news that the catalytic cracker went down at
Hovensa’s Virgin Islands refinery had an immediate impact,”
said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc.
in New York. “The refinery is a major supplier to the U.S.,
especially the East Coast.”  The 525,000-barrel-a-day plant reported a release of steam
containing a hydrocarbon mix, Mark Walters, director of Virgin
Islands Territorial Emergency Management, said in a telephone
interview.  Hovensa Unit  The fluid catalytic cracker at the plant has a capacity of
150,000 barrels a day. Hovensa is a joint venture of state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela SA and Hess Corp.  Gasoline for January delivery climbed 3.59 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.3405 a gallon in New York.  The Hovensa plant receives and processes crude oil from
around the world via tankers and sends finished products to the
U.S. In September, the U.S. received 142,000 barrels a day of
gasoline and 64,000 barrels a day of distillate fuels, including
heating oil and diesel, from the plant, according to Energy
Department data.  “If one refinery goes down, other refineries ramp up
production,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst with Schork Group
Inc., a consulting company in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “This
creates demand for crude oil elsewhere and reduces
inventories.”  Technical Study  Oil in New York may halt its advance past a 26-month peak
above $90 a barrel because of resistance on technical charts
indicated by Bollinger Bands, according to Cameron Hanover Inc.  Crude climbed to $90.76 a barrel on Dec. 7, the highest
intraday price since October 2008. Investors may start selling
contracts when prices advance to about $90.55, said  Peter Beutel , president of the energy adviser based in New Canaan,
Connecticut. That’s the higher of two bands in the Bollinger
technical chart.  “We’ve tried to move into new a new range and then pulled
back,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based broker that
advises companies and governments on energy purchases. “The
market is going to struggle around the $90 area. While there has
been a pickup in demand, inventories remain adequate.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 658,851 contracts as of 3:40
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 808,389
contracts yesterday, 15 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.36 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
