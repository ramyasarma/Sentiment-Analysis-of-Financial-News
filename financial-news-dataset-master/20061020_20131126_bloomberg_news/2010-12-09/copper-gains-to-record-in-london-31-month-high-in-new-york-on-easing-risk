Copper climbed to a record in London
and advanced to a 31-month high in New York on concern the
Federal Reserve may extend asset purchases to support the
economy, driving the dollar lower and boosting the appeal of
commodities as alternative invesmments.  The metal for three-month delivery rose as much as 0.6
percent to $9,066 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
surpassing the previous peak of $9,044 on Dec. 7. The contract
was at $9,065 a ton by 10:31 a.m. Singapore time.  Copper on the Comex in New York gained to $4.1440 a pound,
the highest price since May 2008, when it reached a record
$4.2605.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
