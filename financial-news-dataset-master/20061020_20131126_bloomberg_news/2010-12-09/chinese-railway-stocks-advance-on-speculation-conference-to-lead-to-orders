China Railway Group Ltd.  and China
CNR Corp. led gains by rail-related stocks as investors
speculated the world high-speed rail congress in Beijing will
spur new orders.  China Railway Group, the nation’s biggest construction
company by total assets, rallied 5.9 percent to 4.65 yuan at the
3 p.m. close in Shanghai and 5.9 percent to HK$5.92 at the 4.30
p.m. close in Hong Kong. China CNR rose 5.2 percent to 7.09 yuan.
 CSR Corp.  jumped 7.3 percent to 8.25 yuan. CNR and CSR are the
country’s two biggest railcar makers. The  Shanghai Composite
Index  lost 1.3 percent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index fell less than 0.1 percent.  Chinese Vice Premier  Zhang Dejiang  said at the conference
the nation’s rail companies should look overseas to expand co-
operation, the People’s Daily newspaper reported today. China
has signed agreements or memoranda of understanding for rail
projects with more than 30 countries since 2003, the official
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  “With big orders for high-speed railways at home and
abroad, railway-related companies are one of the few sectors
with solid growth prospects against a backdrop of an uncertain
macro-economic environment,” said  Wu Kan , Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.  Chinese railway companies are winning overseas orders at
the same time as the nation boosts expenditure on its domestic
high-speed network. The country formed ventures with Alstom SA
and Bombardier Inc. this week to help develop new rail systems.
The government plans to spend as much as 4 trillion yuan ($600
billion) expanding rail coverage, the China Securities Journal
reported yesterday, citing an unidentified person.  China’s high-speed rail network is the longest in the world
at 7,531 kilometers and will almost double to 13,000 kilometers
by 2012, the People’s Daily reported yesterday.
      China Railway Construction Corp. , builder of more than half
the nation’s rail links since 1949, gained 2.6 percent to
HK$9.99 in Hong Kong. The stock was raised to “overweight”
from “neutral” at HSBC Holdings by equity analyst  Kenneth Ho .  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Richard Frost , Darren Boey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
