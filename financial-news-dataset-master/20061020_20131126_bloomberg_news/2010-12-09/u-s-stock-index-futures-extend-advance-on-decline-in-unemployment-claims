U.S. stock futures extended gains,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may remain at a two-
year high, after a bigger-than-estimated decrease in jobless
claims bolstered optimism in the economy.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring this month climbed 0.4
percent to 1,234 at 8:34 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures advanced 40 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,408.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased to 421,000,
compared with the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News for 425,000 new claims. Labor Department figures
showed. The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure,
dropped to the lowest level in more than two years.  The  S&P 500  yesterday climbed 0.4 percent to its highest
level since September 2008 after President Barack Obama said
he’ll agree to a two-year extension of tax cuts and American
International Group Inc. said it will repay its Federal Reserve
credit line.  The benchmark gauge has climbed 10 percent this year as the
Federal Reserve pledged a second round of bond purchases to
stimulate the economy, adding to the $1.7 trillion of assets the
central bank has already bought to boost growth.  Stocks advanced around the world as Japan’s economy grew
faster than its government initially calculated in the third
quarter and Australian employers last month added more than
double the number of workers economists had forecast.       To contact the editor responsible for this story:
