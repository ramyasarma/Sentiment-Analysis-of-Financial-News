The pound stayed lower against the
dollar after the Bank of England decided to maintain its asset-
purchase program and kept interest rates at a record low.  Sterling depreciated against 13 of the 16 most active
currencies as a report showed house prices fell. All 34
economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted central bank Governor
 Mervyn King  would keep the so-called quantitative-easing program
unchanged at 200 billion pounds ($315 billion). Economists in a
separate survey said the bank would hold the main interest rate
at 0.5 percent.  The decision “ought to be relatively neutral for
sterling,”  Adam Cole , head of global currency strategy at RBC
Capital Markets in London, said before the announcement.  The pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.5742 as of 12:04 p.m. in
London. It was little changed at 83.89 pence per euro. The 10-
year gilt yield dropped three basis points to 3.52 percent,
while that on the two-year security fell three basis points to
1.09 percent.  Britain’s currency gained 1.2 percent versus the dollar
after the bank’s previous policy meeting on Nov. 4, when it
decided to keep rates on hold. Gilts rose that day, pushing the
10-year yield down by five basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
