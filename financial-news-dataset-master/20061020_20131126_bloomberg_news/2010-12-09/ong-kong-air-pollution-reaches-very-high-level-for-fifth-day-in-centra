Air pollution was “very high”
today at roadside in Hong Kong’s Central and Mong Kok districts,
the Environmental Protection Department said on its website.  The Air Pollution Index had readings of 106 in Central and
102 in Mong Kok as of 7 a.m., the department said. Readings
above 100 trigger a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic
areas. Today was the fifth consecutive day of “very high”
pollution in Central.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
