The Boston Red Sox offered free-agent
outfielder  Carl Crawford  a seven-year contract worth $142
million,  the Boston Globe said , citing an unidentified Major
League Baseball person familiar with the negotiations.  Crawford, 29, is a four-time All-Star and has been with the
Tampa Bay Rays since they selected him as their second-round
pick in 1999.  Last season, Crawford hit .307 with 19 home runs and 90
runs batted in. In nine professional seasons, he’s hit .296 with
104 home runs and 592 RBIs.  Crawford, who earned his first Gold Glove last month, has
stolen 409 bases in his career and has led the American League
four times in the category.  To contact the reporter on this story:
