Japanese Environment Minister Ryu
Matsumoto said a global treaty for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions should be based on last year’s Copenhagen Accord, not
the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a comment that may derail the United
Nations climate talks.  “The Kyoto Protocol has been playing a significant role as
the first step in addressing climate change,” Matsumoto told
delegates at the UN talks in Cancun, Mexico today. “Japan will
maintain the spirit of Kyoto.   ‘‘The protocol only covers 27 percent of global energy
related CO2 emissions. Japan would express our serious concern
that fixing such a framework.  ‘‘Japan will not associate itself with setting the second
commitment period’’ once the current limits expire in 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
