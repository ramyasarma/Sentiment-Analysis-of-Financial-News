China’s soybean buyers have delayed
deliveries of some shipments originally scheduled for arrival in
February to April as slowing sales of soybean meal forced them
to trim production, researcher Grain.gov.cn said.  Demand for protein meal is falling as the country’s
livestock inventory declines, the researcher wrote in an e-
mailed daily report. Higher profits in the past two months
prompted farmers to sell animals earlier than usual, it said.  China’s soybean arrivals may begin to fall from February,
after averaging about 5 million metric tons in November to
January, the researcher said. China’s commercial soybean
inventory is about 6.5 million to 7 million tons now, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
