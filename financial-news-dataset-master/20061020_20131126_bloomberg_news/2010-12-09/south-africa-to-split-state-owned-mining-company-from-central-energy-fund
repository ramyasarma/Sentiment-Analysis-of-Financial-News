South Africa, facing calls from parts
of the ruling African National Congress to nationalize mines,
will expand the government’s role in the industry, splitting off
a state-run minerals company from the country’s energy fund.  The African Exploration Mining and Financing Corp. was
originally created under the Central Energy Fund in 2007.  “When that state mining company was set up, the intention
was to expand the involvement of the state in the mining sector
and therefore I think that objective will still remain,” said
 Collins Chabane , minister in the presidency, in Pretoria today.  The departments of mineral resources and energy, divided in
May 2009, will deal with the separation of the unit, he said.  The head of the ANC’s Youth League  Julius Malema  has made
repeated calls for mine nationalization in line with the party’s
Freedom Charter adopted in 1955. South Africa has the world’s
largest platinum and manganese resources.  To contact the reporters on this story:
