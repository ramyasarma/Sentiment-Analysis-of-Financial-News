Bill Richardson , the governor of New
Mexico, will travel to North Korea next week, State Department
spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said.  “It’s a private visit,”  Crowley  told reporters in
Washington today. Richardson won’t be “carrying any particular
message from the United States government.”  Richardson, who has visited North Korea several times as an
envoy for President  Bill Clinton , will arrive in Pyongyang amid
heightened tensions in the region. North Korea shelled a South
Korean island on Nov. 23, killing four people; a week later, on
Nov. 30, it confirmed that it has a new uranium enrichment
plant.  Crowley said that “normally” Richardson “checks in”
with the State Department before leaving on such missions. He
did not know whether Richardson had done so, “but I would
expect that we would have some contact with him just to bring
him up to speed before he goes.”  Crowley said that Richardson will likely share details of
his trip with State Department officials on his return. A former
member of the House of Representatives, Richardson was also U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations in 1997 and 1998 and was
secretary of energy from 1998 to 2001.  Kim Jong Il ’s regime said the new enrichment plant is part
of a nuclear program intended for peaceful energy use. North
Korea has been under United Nations sanctions for its two
nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
