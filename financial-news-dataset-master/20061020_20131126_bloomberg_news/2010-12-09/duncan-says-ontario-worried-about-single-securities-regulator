Ontario Finance Minister  Dwight Duncan  said today he is concerned other provinces might not join
a planned national securities regulator, opting instead to
create regional ones.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has been pushing for
a national regulator to replace provincial ones, saying the
current system is an “embarrassment” for the country. Alberta
and Quebec oppose the plan. The premiers of Saskatchewan and
Alberta last month discussed creating a western securities
regulator.  “I worry about some of the other provinces,” Duncan said
in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in New York.
“All the best advice we’ve got from all over the world says
what Canada needs is one regulator.”  The federal government has asked the country’s Supreme
Court to rule on whether it can set up a single regulator.
Quebec and Alberta say it would be a breach of provincial
jurisdiction.  Duncan said Ontario will support the federal government’s
position.  To contact the reporters on this story:
