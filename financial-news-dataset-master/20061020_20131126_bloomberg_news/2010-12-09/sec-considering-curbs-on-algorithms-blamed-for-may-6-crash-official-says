The Securities and Exchange
Commission is considering whether to require automated trading
programs known as algorithms to run risk checks that prevent
errant executions, according to  David Shillman , an associate
director in the agency’s division of trading and markets.  Regulators are concerned algorithms could act “too
aggressively,” causing a security’s price to move rapidly,
Shillman said. Safety checks could prevent algorithms, which
execute larger trades by slicing them into pieces, from
destabilizing markets. The SEC says an algorithmic trade of
futures that gave no regard to prices or timing helped drive the
May 6 crash that erased $862 billion from the value of U.S.
equities in less than 20 minutes.  The SEC is considering whether there should be a “throttle
on an algorithm that prevents overly aggressive moves without
checks on price or time,” Shillman said at an Investment
Company Institute conference in New York today.  Another idea regulators are evaluating is whether
“baseline qualifications” should be required for individuals
who design and use trading algorithms. Shillman said this is a
separate issue from the notion of a throttle.  “The concern would be some completely unqualified person
designing an algo” that could impact trading in a security or
the broader market, he told reporters at the ICI conference. He
stressed that these discussions at the staff level in the SEC
are preliminary.  To contact the reporters on this story:
