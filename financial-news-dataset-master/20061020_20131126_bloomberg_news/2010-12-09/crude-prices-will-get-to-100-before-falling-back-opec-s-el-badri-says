Oil prices of $100 a barrel may
indicate "something wrong with fundamentals" in the market and
lead OPEC to act, said  Abdalla El-Badri , the organization’s
secretary-general.  Current prices are at “suitable levels,” El-Badri said
today in Quito, Ecuador, where OPEC will meet Dec. 11 to review
its output. Demand is growing very fast in China and India and
moderately in members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, he said.  “When the price goes to $100, that means there is
something wrong with the fundamentals, then we have to do
something,” El-Badri told reporters. “If it goes to $100
because of speculation, OPEC could not move.”  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
hasn’t changed quotas since late 2008, when it announced the
biggest-ever reduction in output as global demand collapsed and
prices plummeted.  Ali al-Naimi , oil minister of OPEC’s de facto
leader Saudi Arabia, said Nov. 1 that crude-importing countries
are happy with prices between $70 and $90, a higher range than
the spread of $70 to $80 he cited on March 30.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 58 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $88.86 a barrel at 1:05 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The price exceeded $90 a barrel on Dec. 7
for the first time in two years.  Shokri Ghanem , chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp., said
in an interview yesterday that OPEC may alter its production
strategy next year if prices breach $100.  “At this time the market is in a really comfortable way
and we don’t want to disturb it,” El-Badri said today.
Compliance with OPEC’s existing output guidelines is 55 percent
this month and about 61 percent as an average for 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
