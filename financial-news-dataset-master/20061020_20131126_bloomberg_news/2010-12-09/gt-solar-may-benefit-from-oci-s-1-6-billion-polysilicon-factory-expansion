GT Solar International Inc.  may be
active in Nasdaq trading after the supplier of solar-power
equipment said it expects orders from a customer’s planned $1.6
billion expansion.  The Merrimack, New Hampshire-based company leaped 19
percent yesterday after South Korea’s OCI Co. said it will spend
1.9 trillion won ($1.7 billion) on capital investments.  OCI , the world’s second-largest polysilicon maker, plans to
expand output of the material used to make cells for solar
panels, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The
investment will boost OCI’s annual polysilicon output to 62,000
metric tons by 2012 from the current 17,000 tons.  The spending “will make them absolutely the number one
player in the world using our technology,”  Tom Gutierrez ,
president and chief executive officer of GT Solar, said on a
conference call yesterday, according to a Bloomberg transcript.  OCI’s expansion will bring new orders to GT Solar that are
not included in the company’s current backlog of “more than $1
billion,” Gutierrez said.  OCI will spend 1.6 trillion won to build its fourth plant
with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons a year by 2012 and 280
billion won to increase the capacity of its No. 3 plant, it said
yesterday in the statement.  South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest producer of greenhouse
gases, has said the government and private industry aim to
invest 40 trillion won in renewable energy by 2015.  GT Solar  rose  $1.53, or 19 percent, to $9.41 yesterday on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. That cut its loss to 43 percent from
the $16.50 price of its initial public offer in July 2008. The
stock has gained 69 percent this year.  Shares  of OCI gained 5.8 percent to close at 338,500 won in
Seoul trading today, the highest since Nov. 8, extending a 3.7
percent gain yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
