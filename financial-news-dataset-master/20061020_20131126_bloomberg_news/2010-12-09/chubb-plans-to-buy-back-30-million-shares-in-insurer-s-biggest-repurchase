Chubb Corp. , the insurer of commercial
property and high-end homes, said it will repurchase 30 million
shares, the company’s biggest buyback, after raising its
forecast for full-year profit.  The repurchase program equals almost 10 percent of the
304.9 million Chubb  shares outstanding  as of Sept. 30 and would
cost about $1.8 billion at the Warren, New Jersey-based
company’s $58.70 closing price yesterday. Chubb’s  largest
buyback  announced before today was in December 2007 when the
company said it would repurchase 28 million shares.  “It’s a pretty heavy buyback,”  Paul Newsome , an analyst
with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said when asked before the
announcement about the potential for a record repurchase. 
The move could be “a signal that they’re healthier than people 
think.”  Chubb joins insurers including  Allstate Corp.  and  Travelers
Cos.  in returning capital to shareholders after the U.S. escaped
major hurricanes this year. Allstate said in November that it
will repurchase $1 billion in shares by March 31, 2012, and
Travelers boosted its 2010 stock buyback program in September to
a range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in shares, compared with
its previous projection of $4 billion.  Operating income per share for 2010 will be $5.75 to $5.85,
up from a previous forecast of $5.15 to $5.55, Chubb said in
October. The insurer bought 10.2 million shares for $555 million
in the third quarter.  Chubb advanced 38 cents $59.08 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 4 p.m. The insurer has advanced about 20
percent this year, compared with the 21 percent climb of the 24-
company KBW Insurance Index.  Quarterly Dividend  The insurer approved a dividend of 37 cents a share, the
same as in the prior quarter. The payout may be lifted to 39.5
cents in the first quarter of next year, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Today’s actions reflect the board’s continued confidence
in Chubb’s strong financial condition,” Chief Executive Officer
 John Finnegan  said in a statement.  Third-quarter  operating income  was $1.69 a share, beating
the $1.41 average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The insurer had catastrophe costs of $58 million in the period,
compared with more than $500 million in the third quarter of
2005 when Hurricane Katrina struck. The U.S. and its oil and gas
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have escaped a direct strike
from hurricanes this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
