Tata Motors Ltd.  more than doubled
warranty lengths on Nano compacts and introduced a 99 rupee
($2)-a-month maintenance option as it battles plunging sales of
the world’s cheapest car.  The company lengthened warranties to four years or 60,000
kilometers (37,282 miles) for both new Nanos and ones already
sold, it said in a statement today. The maintenance contract is
being introduced to help pare running costs, it said.  Nano  sales tumbled 85 percent last month to 509 units, the
lowest since the car’s debut, after vehicle fires raised safety
concerns and following two price rises since July. A lack of
financing has also damped sales, according to Tata.  To help boost sales, Tata is setting up Nano access points
in smaller towns and villages, offering test drives. It is also
promoting tie-ups with banks offering as much as 90 percent
financing on cars.  The automaker has sold more than 71,000 Nano cars since
starting delivery in July last year. It earlier offered a
warranty of 1 1/2 years or 24,000 kilometers for the car,
according to  Debasis Ray , a spokesman.  Tata, also the owner of the Jaguar Land Rover,  fell  as much
as 4.6 percent to 1,274.6 rupees and traded at 1,285 rupees as
of 2:57 p.m. in Mumbai. The shares have risen 62 percent this
year.  The automaker said last month it would retrofit Nano cars
with additional protection in the exhaust and electrical systems
after fires in at least three vehicles. Investigations concluded
that the reasons for the fire were “specific” to the cars
involved in the incident, Tata said.  The automaker opened a new factory for the 624-cc Nano in
the western Indian state of Gujarat in June. The plant with a
capacity to build 250,000 cars a year is fully operational.  Tata currently sells the Nano in 12 Indian states as it
worked through initial orders and ramps up production. It aims
to open sales nationwide by March, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
