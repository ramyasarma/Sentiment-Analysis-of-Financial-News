Japanese 10-year  bonds  rose the most
in two years, pushing yields down from a six-month high, as
signs of waning confidence in the economy boosted demand for
safer assets.  Benchmark bonds snapped eight weeks of losses after the
Tokyo Shimbun said the government may lower its growth forecast
for fiscal 2011. Five-year notes climbed for the first time in
four days after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the securities were
undervalued, and a technical indicator signaled the debt was due
for a rebound.  “It’s hard to imagine bond yields will continue to rise,”
said  Hisakazu Amano , who helps oversee about $29 billion at
Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co. “Once they reach certain
levels, people typically pile in.”  The  yield  on the 10-year bond dropped 7.5 basis points to
1.19 percent as of 3:39 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent
security due December 2020 rose 0.667 yen to 100.089 yen.  The daily retreat in the yield was the biggest since
October 2008. It reached 1.27 percent yesterday, the highest
level since June 4.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery gained 0.59 to
139.71 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Ten-year yields have lost 1.5 basis points since Dec. 3.
They completed an eighth weekly decline on Dec. 3, the longest
losing streak since April 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  More Pessimistic  Sentiment among domestic manufacturers was minus 8 points
this quarter, compared with a reading of 13.3 three months ago,
the government said today. A number less than zero means
pessimists outnumber optimists. A household  confidence index 
declined for a fifth month in November, another report showed.  The government may cut its real economic growth forecast
for fiscal 2011 to 1.4 percent from 2 percent, the Tokyo Shimbun
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
The government yesterday revised the third-quarter growth rate
to 4.5 percent from the 3.9 percent reported last month.  “With the slowing economy and continuation of monetary
easing, Japan’s economic fundamentals remain unchanged,”
 Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
wrote today in a note to clients. “Considering that, the bottom
range of 10-year yields should be below 1 percent.”  The benchmark  five-year yield  lost four basis points to
0.52 percent today. It touched 0.55 percent yesterday, the
highest level since April 12, after demand dropped at an auction
of the securities. The yield  premium  investors demand to hold
Japanese five-year notes instead of their U.S. counterparts rose
to 131 basis points from a low of 74 basis points on Nov. 4.  “This is a time to profit from a correction of five-year
notes, which have become undervalued on the yield curve,”
 Takafumi Yamawaki , Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at
JPMorgan, wrote in a report yesterday.  The 14-day relative strength  index  for five-year yields
rose to 70 yesterday, a threshold some traders see as a sign an
asset’s value is poised to change direction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
