ASML Holding NV, Europe’s biggest
semiconductor equipment maker, rose the most in more than two
years in Amsterdam after raising its forecast for fourth-quarter
bookings to more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion).  ASML  jumped  8 percent to 28.4 euros, the biggest advance
since November 2008. “Stronger than expected” demand for
lithography equipment from most chip markets is responsible for
the forecast, the company said in a statement today.  “The upside to bookings comes as a clear positive surprise
and provides further support to the prospect for ASML being able
to grow sales and earnings in 2011,”  Peter Olofsen , an analyst
at Kepler Capital Markets in Amsterdam, said in a note.  ASML, the maker of machines that produce chips for Apple
Inc.’s iPods and Nokia Oyj’s mobile phones, is benefitting from
increased demand for equipment to make memory chips. The
Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company, which received 1.3 billion
euros in net orders for the third quarter, said in October that
it expected bookings in the last quarter of 2010 “to exceed the
Q3 level.”  On Oct. 13, ASML projected fourth-quarter revenue of about
1.3 billion euros and repeated its full-year forecast for sales
to grow 10 percent to 15 percent above a record 3.8 billion
euros in 2007.  Global semiconductor capital equipment spending is
projected to more than double to $36.9 billion this year from
$16.6 billion in 2009, researcher Gartner Inc. said Sept. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
