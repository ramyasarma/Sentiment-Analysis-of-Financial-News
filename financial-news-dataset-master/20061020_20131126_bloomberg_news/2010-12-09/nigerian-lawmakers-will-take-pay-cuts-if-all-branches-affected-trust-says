Nigerian lawmakers are ready for a
cut in their salaries and allowances provided other segments of
government agree to similar reductions, the Trust reported,
citing Senator Ayogu Eze, spokesman for the upper chamber of the
legislature.  Parliamentarians have been subjected to criticism after the
 central bank  governor,  Lamido Sanusi , said last month that
lawmakers were responsible for a quarter of the government’s
recurrent expenditure, Eze said yesterday, according to the
Abuja-based newspaper.  When invited by the lawmakers to defend the comment, Sanusi
reiterated that the government’s recurrent expenditure was 536.3
billion naira ($3.5 billion), of which 136.3 billion naira went
to the parliament, the newspaper reported yesterday. The
lawmakers dispute the figures, which Sanusi said he got from the
budget office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
