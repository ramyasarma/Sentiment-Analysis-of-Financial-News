     Dec. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Roche Holding AG  is moving
experimental schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis medicines to
the final stage of testing and may submit as many as 10 new drug
applications to regulators by the end of 2013.  The first patient has already been enrolled in a late-stage
trial of RG1678 for use in schizophrenia, and a test of
ocrelizumab in MS will start in the first quarter of 2011, the
Basel, Switzerland-based company said today in a  statement . The
company is presenting its portfolio of medicines to investors in
London today.  Roche needs new treatments to boost growth after delays to
the experimental T-DM1 breast cancer medicine and the
taspoglutide diabetes drug. Avastin, the company’s top seller,
failed in studies in prostate, stomach and early colorectal
cancer. The drug is also under threat because of U.S. and
European regulatory reviews of its use in breast tumors.  “Overall, the summary of data should remind investors that
Roche’s pipeline is impressively large and has strong
opportunities to surprise over the coming two years, despite the
setback in 2010,” Andrew Weiss, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG
in Zurich, said in a note to investors. Weiss  recommends  buying
Roche shares.  Roche gained 1.1 Swiss francs, or 0.8 percent, to 142.1
francs as of 9:20 a.m. in Zurich trading. The stock has fallen
17 percent this year including reinvested dividends,  compared 
with a 9 percent return for the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical
Index.  Schizophrenia Symptoms  RG1678, a so-called glycine reuptake inhibitor, was
effective in reducing the “negative symptoms” of
schizophrenia, Roche  said Dec. 6 . These include a loss of
motivation and interest in social activities, isolation and
difficulty finding pleasure in everyday life, the company said.
Current treatments for the disease mostly address the positive
symptoms for the disease, which include hallucinations and
delusions, Roche said.  The mental disorder affects about 24 million people
worldwide and is usually diagnosed in people aged between 15 and
35 years old, Roche said.  Ocrelizumab has been shown to reduce disease activity in MS
as measured by brain lesions and rate of relapses in a mid-stage
trial, Roche said. The company said it will conduct two late-
stage trials.  ---Editors: Phil Serafino  To contact the reporter on this story:
