The trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s investment firm sued former Tremont Capital Management
Chief Executive Officer  Sandra Manzke  and Maxam Capital
Management seeking more than $100 million.  Maxam, which Manzke started after she left Tremont in 2005,
invested more than $300 million of investors’ money with Madoff
in less than three years, said  Irving Picard , the trustee, in a
complaint filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The
trustee seeks a return of almost $100 million that Maxam
withdrew from Madoff as well as fees the firm received.  “Every dollar the Maxam defendants purportedly earned and
every dollar they kept to unjustly enrich themselves, their
funds or other investors, was other investors’ stolen money,”
Picard said in the complaint.  The trustee yesterday sued Tremont Group Holdings Inc.,
which he said was the second-largest Madoff feeder fund group.
That complaint, which was filed under seal, also named Manzke,
Tremont’s founder, according to a press statement.  Manzke didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
seeking comment today. Jonathan Cogan, a lawyer who represents
Manzke in a separate securities lawsuit against Tremont, didn’t
immediately return a call to his office after regular business
hours.  The case is Irving Picard v. Maxam Absolute Return Fund,
10-ap-5342, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
