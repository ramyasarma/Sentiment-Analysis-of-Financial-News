Treasury 30-year bonds advanced for
the first time in three days as yields near seven-month highs
bolstered demand at the government’s auction of $13 billion of
the securities.  Benchmark 10-year notes rose after their biggest two-day
slump since September 2008 following the agreement of President
 Barack Obama  this week to extend tax cuts enacted under his
predecessor. The bonds sold today drew the highest level of
demand since August, with a group of investors including foreign
central banks buying the biggest share in more than a year.  “The bond market is rallying,” said  Ajay Rajadhyaksha ,
head of U.S. fixed-income strategy in New York at Barclays Plc,
one of the 18 primary dealers obligated to participate in
auctions. “These are attractive yield levels. Inflation is not
going anywhere anytime soon. The Fed is still buying.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 3.21 percent at 5:09 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 rose 17/32, or $5.31
per $1,000 face amount, to 95 3/32.  The 30-year bond yield decreased six basis points to 4.40
percent after rising yesterday to 4.50 percent, the highest
level since May 13. The two-year note yield was little changed
at 0.62 percent after touching 0.64 percent today, the highest
level since July 28.  ‘More Attractive’  “Demand at the auction was a function of more attractive
yields,” said  Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in New
York at Credit Suisse Group AG, a primary dealer. “There seems
to be value in the long end if you don’t buy into the inflation-
risk story. With the Fed buying and the Fed meeting next week,
the market should do relatively well.”  Central bank policy makers are preparing to gather Dec. 14
after announcing last month a $600 billion second round of debt
buying through June. The Fed expects to reinvest $250 billion to
$300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt and agency
securities into Treasuries during that time.  Buying more U.S. government bonds than already announced is
“certainly possible,” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an
interview broadcast Dec. 5 on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes”
program. “It depends on the efficacy of the program” and the
outlook for inflation and the economy, Bernanke said.  The 30-year securities sold today produced a yield of 4.410
percent, compared with the average forecast of 4.477 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey of 7 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 2.74, the highest since the
Aug. 12 sale.  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, the class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 49.5 percent of the securities,
the highest level since July 2009.  The $32 billion three-year note auction on Dec. 7 attracted
the lowest bid-to-cover ratio since February. The Treasury sold
$21 billion of 10-year notes yesterday at a yield of 3.34
percent, the highest in seven months. There won’t be another
round of note offerings until the Treasury sells 2-, 5- and 7-
year debt starting Dec. 27.  Treasuries briefly pared  gains  after the Fed purchased
fewer seven-year notes today under its program of quantitative
easing than some investors expected.  The central bank bought $8.309 billion of Treasuries
maturing from November 2016 to November 2017. The Fed had said
it would consider purchases of $7 billion to $9 billion of debt
due from June 2016 to November 2017.  ‘More Expectation’  “The Fed still bought a lot of the sector, but there was
more expectation,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of interest rates
in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a primary dealer.  Bonds  tumbled yesterday for a second day after Obama agreed
on Dec. 6 to a two-year extension of current tax rates in
exchange for another 13 months of federal unemployment insurance
for the long-term jobless and cutting the payroll tax by $120
billion for one year.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, is raising its forecast for U.S.
growth next year as policy makers pump a “massive amount” of
stimulus into the economy, Chief Executive Officer  Mohamed El- Erian  said a telephone interview today from his office in
Newport Beach, California.  Pimco sees the economy growing 3 percent to 3.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of next year from the same period of this
year. That compares with its previous estimate for 2 percent to
2.5 percent growth and the 2.2 percent gain forecast for this
year by the International Monetary Fund.  Jobless Claims  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to 421,000 in the
week ended Dec. 4, from a revised 438,000 in the previous week,
the Labor Department reported today. The median  forecast  of 50
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop to 425,000
from a previously reported 436,000.  The 10-year note yield increased 35 basis points over the
past two days, the biggest such gain since Sept. 19, 2008, when
markets were in upheaval following the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  The seven-day  relative strength index  on the 10-year
Treasury note yield was at 71.15 after rising as high as 78
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. Readings of 70 or above
typically indicate yields are poised to fall.  “We judge that the sell-off of 10-year Treasuries has been
overdone,” the New York-based strategists  Brett Rose  and  Joseph Leary  at the primary dealer Citigroup Inc. wrote in a research
note today. Investors should buy Treasuries until the yield
falls to near 3.06 percent or in five business days, whichever
comes first, according to Citigroup.  To contact the reporters on this story:
