Mozambique expects its economy to
grow 7.2 percent next year, state controlled Televisao de
Mocambique reported, citing Prime Minister Aires Ali quoting the
government’s economic and social plan for 2011.  Ali said the southern African country’s growth will be
driven by a better agriculture performance, according to the
report. The government forecast exports of $2.4 billion in 2011,
an increase of 15 percent on the projections for this year, the
Television station said.   Inflation will average 8 percent in 2011, the Maputo-based
broadcaster cited Ali as saying.    For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
