The U.K. government will tax banks’
 balance sheets  at a higher level than first proposed, raising
almost 9 billion pounds ($14 billion) over the next four years.  Starting Jan. 1, the government will charge 0.05 percent
instead of the 0.04 percent announced in June, the Treasury said
in a statement in London today. The rate will rise to 0.075
percent from 2012 rather than 0.07 percent.  The levy, which will apply to banks with revenue of more
than 20 billion pounds, is aimed at raising 2.5 billion pounds a
year to help Prime Minister  David Cameron  narrow the record
budget deficit.  The levy seeks to ensure banks “make a fair contribution
in respect of the potential risks they pose to the U.K.
financial system and wider economy,” Treasury minister  Mark Hoban  said in the statement. It also aims to ”encourage the
banks to make greater use of more stable sources of funding,
such as long-term debt and equity, working with the grain of our
wider reform programme.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  vowed in October
to “extract the maximum sustainable” revenue from financial-
services firms as he seeks to eliminate a deficit forecast to
reach 10 percent of  gross domestic product  in the fiscal year
through March. The levy will affect the global businesses of
U.K. banks and the British-based units of foreign banks.  The higher rate will raise an extra 400 million pounds for
the Treasury over four years. Certain deposits won’t be taxed,
while others will be taxed at half of the published rate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
