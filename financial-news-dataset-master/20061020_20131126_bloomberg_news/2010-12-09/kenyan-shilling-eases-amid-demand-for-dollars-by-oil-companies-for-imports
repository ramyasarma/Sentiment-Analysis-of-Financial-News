Kenya’s shilling weakened amid demand
for dollars by domestic oil companies and as the U.S. currency
gained against the euro.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slipped as
much as 0.9 percent to 80.55 percent, where it was trading at
11:52 am in Nairobi, the capital. It closed at 79.85 yesterday.  “The shilling weakened due to demand for dollars by oil
companies” to pay for crude imports, John Muli, a Nairobi-based
trader at  African Banking Corp. , said in a phone interview.  The dollar strengthened for a fourth day against the euro
after stocks pared their earlier advance, stoking demand for the
relative safety U.S. currency. The dollar rose 0.3 percent to
$1.3226 per euro at 11:03 a.m. in London from $1.3262 yesterday.  The Kenyan currency may strengthen in the coming days as
demand for foreign currency tapers off, said  Wilson Mutai , a
dealer at African Banking.  “With businesses winding down for the year, the shilling is
expected to strengthen in the coming days as demand slows down,”
Mutai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
