Crude stockpiling for commercial and
emergency use may account for 300,000 barrels a day of China’s
incremental oil demand in the next two years, the nation’s
largest investment bank said.  Stockpiling for emergency use will contribute a 140,000
barrel-a-day increase to China’s demand growth, while commercial
inventory building will account for a gain of about 160,000
barrels a day, Kong Qingying, an analyst at China International
Capital Corp., wrote in a  research report  dated yesterday.  The country finished filling the first phase of its
emergency crude stockpiles of 16.4 million cubic meters last
year, or 103 million barrels, according to the report. The
second phase of 26.8 million cubic meters is expected to be
completed in 2012 to 2013, Kong said.  The third phase of 36.2 million cubic meters may be done by
2015 to 2016, the analyst said.  Commercial crude inventories will rise to 491 million
barrels in 2015, from 457 million barrels in 2012 and 402
million barrels at the end of this year, according to Kong.  The stockpiling may boost global crude prices by $6.50 a
barrel, Kong said, without giving a timeframe for the price gain.  U.S. crude futures more doubled since the beginning of 2009
to $90.76 a barrel on Dec. 7, the highest in 26 months.
Contracts were at $88.92 a barrel as of 11:50 a.m. Singapore
