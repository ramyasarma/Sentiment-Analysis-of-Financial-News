The National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa rejected the government’s new economic growth plan,
saying it won’t change patterns of investment and ownership in
the economy.  The plan relies on fiscal policy that is “too
restrictive” and an “illogical” exchange-rate policy, the
union said in an e-mailed statement from Johannesburg today.  “A battle seems to be looming; a battle about the
direction which the country’s economic development should
take,” the union said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
