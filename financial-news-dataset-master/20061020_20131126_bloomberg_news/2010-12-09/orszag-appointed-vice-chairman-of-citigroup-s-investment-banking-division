Citigroup Inc. , the biggest bailout
recipient among U.S. banks during the financial crisis, hired
former White House Budget Director  Peter Orszag  to be vice
chairman of its investment-banking division.  Orszag, 41, who left President  Barack Obama ’s cabinet in
July, will report to  John Havens , chief executive officer of the
firm’s institutional client group, the New York-based lender
said in a statement today. To comply with “applicable ethics
rules,” Orszag’s work at Citigroup won’t involve contact with
U.S. federal government officials.  An economist trained at Princeton University and the London
School of Economics, Orszag helped shape U.S. economic stimulus
during the financial crisis and overhaul the health-care system.
He spent 18 months as Obama’s budget director.  “Peter brings a tremendous amount of knowledge as well as
key private-sector and government experience,” Havens, 54, said
in the statement. “His expertise in economic policy will
complement our investment banking franchise around the world.”  After leaving the government, Orszag became a distinguished
visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a
contributing columnist for the  New York Times , writing about
health care, budget policy and Social Security. His successor as
budget director,  Jacob Lew , worked at Citigroup from 2006 to
2009.  Citigroup got a $45 billion bailout in 2008. It repaid $20
billion of last year and the rest was converted into stock. The
U.S. Treasury Department sold its remaining stake in the bank
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
