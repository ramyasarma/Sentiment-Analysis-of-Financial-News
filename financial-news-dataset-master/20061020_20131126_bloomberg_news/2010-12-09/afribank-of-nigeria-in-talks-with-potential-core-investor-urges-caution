Afribank Plc, a Nigerian lender
bailed out last year by the central bank, said it has begun

to a recapitalization of the bank.  The Lagos-based company urged shareholders to exercise
caution in their share dealings until a further announcement is
made.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
