The Czech Senate approved a new law
levying a 26 percent tax on solar-energy producers for the next
three years and imposing a 32 percent tax on carbon credits
awarded to companies in the coming two years.  The 26 percent tax on revenue will not apply to solar
plants placed on top of buildings with a capacity lower than 30
kilowatts, according to the law passed yesterday in a late
evening vote.  The proceeds from the taxes will be used to reduce the
increase in household and industrial electricity prices next
year. The law requires the President’s signature before taking
effect next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
