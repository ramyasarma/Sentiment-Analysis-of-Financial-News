Clover Industries Ltd. , South
Africa’s largest dairy supplier, said Fidelity International and
Allan Gray Ltd. were among the buyers in its oversubscribed
share offer raising 575 million rand ($83 million).  “We’re very happy,” said Clover Chief Executive Officer
 Johann Vorster , who expected to raise about 500 million rand.
“The quality of the shareholders is impressive.” Sanlam Ltd.
and  Coronation Fund Managers Ltd.  also bought equity prior to
the company’s stock exchange listing in Johannesburg on Dec. 14.  Clover sold 54,761,905 shares at 10.50 rand each, compared
with a 9 rand to 12 rand offer range in the private placement,
according to a statement today. The company, which supplies more
than a quarter of South Africa’s fresh milk, will use the funds
to expand output, reorganize logistics and cut debt.  Clover says it sees opportunities for mergers with other
food processors and of buying out minority shareholders from its
units. The company, which also has operations in Botswana and
Namibia, is seeking to expand to Angola, Nigeria, Sudan and
Kenya, according to its Nov. 29 prelisting statement.  The milk company will consider raising funds after its
listing should it find acquisition candidates, Vorster said. The
“strongly oversubscribed” private placement represented 32
percent of outstanding shares, while milk producers own 12
percent and directors and management 11 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
