Natural gas futures dropped from a
four-month high after a government report showed adequate
supplies of the heating fuel to meet cold-weather needs.  Gas fell 3.7 percent after the Energy Department said
stockpiles dropped 89 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec.
3 to 3.725 trillion cubic feet. Inventories were 9.8 percent
above the five-year average. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg before the report showed declines ranging from 71
billion to 108 billion cubic feet.  “The storage number is pretty much in line with the
expectation,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFGBest in
Chicago. “At the end of the day, gas supplies are still very
ample.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 17.1 cents to settle
at $4.435 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures have declined 20 percent this
year.  Last week’s storage drop was bigger than the five-year
average drop for the week of 74 billion cubic feet, department
data showed. A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 1.5
percent from 0.6 percent.  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said on Dec. 7 in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook.  Production Estimate  Gas output will average a record 62.09 billion cubic feet a
day this year, the department said in the report. The total was
up 1 percent from a November estimate.  Prices for gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, will average $4.37 per million Btu this year and
$4.33 next year, according to the report from the department’s
Energy Information Administration.  “The market seems pretty unimpressed by the storage
number,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston at
Canaccord Genuity. “Inventories are still almost 10 percent
above the five-year average. Storage remains pretty healthy even
though you are getting some relatively large early winter
withdrawals.”  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs rose to 961 in the
week ended Dec. 3, 28 percent higher than a year earlier
according to data published by Baker Hughes Inc.  Temperatures will be below average next week across the
eastern U.S., according to the National Weather Service.  Below Normal  New York will have a low of 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8
Celsius) on Dec. 14, 15 degrees below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. Chicago will
have a low of 14 degrees, 9 degrees below normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 5.89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.5238 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange, the highest level
since Aug. 9.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
377,433 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
280,000. Volume was 471,513 yesterday. Open interest was 767,745
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 794,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
