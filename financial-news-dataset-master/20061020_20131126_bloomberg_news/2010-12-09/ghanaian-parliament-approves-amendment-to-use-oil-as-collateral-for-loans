Ghana’s parliament approved a plan to
allow the government to use future oil revenue as collateral for
loans that would be taken to develop infrastructure in Africa’s
newest crude exporter.  The ruling National Democratic Congress won a vote that was
split along party lines to amend part of a proposed policy that
will control how revenue from the nascent energy industry are
spent.  Under the bill that is still being considered by lawmakers,
Ghana must set aside 30 percent of its oil revenue in a savings
account for when output dries up and a second account that will
be tapped in the event of sudden declines in prices or
production. The government can use the remaining 70 percent for
spending or to finance borrowing.  The opposition New Patriotic Party opposed the measure,
saying it risked crippling the country with debt.  “Other countries, they get easy access to loans and they
use it for frivolous projects,” said  George Gyan-Baffour , an
opposition member and former deputy finance minister.  Ghana will begin pumping oil from its offshore Jubilee
field Dec. 15. The government will earn 584 million cedis ($400
million) in 2011, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said Nov. 18.
The World Bank estimates oil could earn the government an
average of $1 billion per year through 2029.  To contact the reporter on this story:
