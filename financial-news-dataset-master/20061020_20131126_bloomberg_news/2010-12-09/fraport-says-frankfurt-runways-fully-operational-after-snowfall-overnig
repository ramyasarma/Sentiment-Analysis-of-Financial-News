Fraport AG said runways at Frankfurt
airport have returned to full operation after snow clearance,
though passengers can expect there will be some further delays
and flight cancellations today. Heavy snowfall in the area
caused the runways to be closed for about four hours overnight,
the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
