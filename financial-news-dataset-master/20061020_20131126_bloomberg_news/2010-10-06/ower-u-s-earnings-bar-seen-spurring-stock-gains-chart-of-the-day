U.S. stocks are poised for bigger
earnings-related gains than they had last quarter because profit
projections are falling, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S.
market strategist at UBS Securities LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates the decline by tracking
estimated earnings growth for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures are
derived from projections for specific companies, using what’s
known as a bottom-up calculation.  Alcoa Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. release third-quarter results
tomorrow, starting a deluge of earnings reports that will last
through mid-November.  “This is going to be a fantastic earnings season,” Golub
said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Radio. “Companies
are going to deliver much better results than people expect.”
Analysts project a 23.4 percent increase in S&P 500 profits,
down from an estimated 24.9 percent when the period began.  In the second quarter, only half of the S&P 500’s 10 main
industry groups benefited from earnings that exceeded estimates,
Golub wrote in an Oct. 4 report. Technology companies with so-
called positive surprises were little changed. Producers of
consumer staples, such as food, beverages and tobacco, fell
along with health-care, raw-material and utility stocks.  “A period of catch-up might occur” as companies with a
track record of beating projections move higher, he wrote. “On
the flip side, we expect companies that have risen with the tide
of the market” to become laggards.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
