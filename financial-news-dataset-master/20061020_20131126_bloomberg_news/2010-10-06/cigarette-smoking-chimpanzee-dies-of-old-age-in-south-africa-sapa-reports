Charlie, a cigarette-smoking
chimpanzee, died in a South African zoo at the age of 52, the
South African Press Association reported, citing Qondile
Khedama, a spokesman for the Manguang municipality in the
country’s Free State province.  Chimpanzees lived on average 36 to 40 years, the
Johannesburg-based news service said, citing Khedama. Charlie,
who had been receiving a special diet that included protein
shakes and vitamin and mineral supplements, succumbed to old age
yesterday, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
