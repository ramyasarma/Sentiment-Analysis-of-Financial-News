Taiwan stocks were reduced to
“bearish” at Nomura Holdings Inc., which said that the lack of
a large property sector or asset base is making it harder for
investors to bet on reflation as its currency appreciates.  The brokerage raised Australia and New Zealand to
“bullish,” citing “favorable terms of trade” relative to
Taiwan, according to a report today by analysts led by Sean
Darby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
