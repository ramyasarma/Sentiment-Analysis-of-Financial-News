The cost of hiring a capesize, ships
three times the length of a football field, jumped 20 percent
this week on strengthening demand for iron ore.  Daily  rates  rose 6.3 percent to $39,268 today, the highest
level in three weeks, according to the Baltic Exchange in
London. The three-day advance of 20 percent is the biggest since
August. The Baltic Dry Index, which also includes other
commodity ship sizes, rose 2.7 percent to 2,639 points.  Demand for capesizes is strengthening and nine were booked
in one day, led by mining companies seeking to ship iron-ore
cargoes to China, according to Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York.
The  cost  of 62 percent iron-content ore delivered to Tianjin
port in China rose 22 percent to $144 a metric ton since July
13, according to data provider The Steel Index. Prices traded as
high as $186.50 in April.  “In a good market, you can do about 20 to 25 capesizes a
week, so to do nine in one day is pretty significant,” said
 Omar Nokta , head of research at Dahlman Rose. “Steel prices are
much better than last quarter and iron ore is cheaper, so the
two are coming together to make seaborne demand much better.”  Strengthening demand for commodities in China and India
should help sustain rates for capesizes, Kenichi Nagata,
managing director of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd.’s coal and iron ore
carrier division, said in an interview in London today. China
accounted for about three-fifths of the world’s steel production
in the first eight months of the year, according to the
Brussels-based World Steel Association.  Iron-Ore Shipments  Global iron-ore shipments will rise 7.9 percent to 979
million tons this year and another 7.9 percent to 1.06 billion
tons in 2011, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd. Coal
shipments will expand 9.7 percent this year and 7 percent next
year. Combined trade in dry bulk, which includes commodities
such as grains and bauxite, will expand 9 percent this year, the
fastest pace since at least 2000, Clarkson estimates.  Daily rates for smaller panamaxes dropped 0.1 percent to
$18,972, the lowest since July 22, according to the Baltic
Exchange. Rates for supramaxes advanced 0.7 percent to $19,588
and handysizes gained 0.2 percent to $15,215.  To contact the reporter on this story:
