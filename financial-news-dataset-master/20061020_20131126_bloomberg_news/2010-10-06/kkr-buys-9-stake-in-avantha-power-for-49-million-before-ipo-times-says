KKR & Co. bought a 9 percent stake in
India’s Avantha Power & Infrastructure Ltd. for 2.17 billion
rupees ($48.6 million), the Economic Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The U.S. private-equity investor purchased 64 million
shares at 34 rupees apiece in a transaction that values the
Indian company at 24.5 billion rupees, according to the report.
Avantha is planning to hold its initial public offering of
equities from Oct. 11 through Oct. 14, seeking to raise as much
as 12.5 billion rupees, according a sale document published in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
