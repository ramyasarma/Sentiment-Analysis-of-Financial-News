Ecuadorean  inflation  accelerated for
a third month in September, the National Statistics and Census
Institute reported.  Consumer prices rose 0.26 percent last month from the
previous month and 3.44 percent from the same month a year
earlier, the institute reported on its website.  South America’s seventh-biggest economy  expanded  1.9
percent in the second quarter, its steepest quarterly growth
since 2008, while gross domestic product increased 2.7 percent
from the same period a year earlier, the central bank said Sept.
30. The bank lowered its 2010 forecast for economic growth to
3.7 percent from 6.8 percent on Aug. 10.  Ecuador’s total oil production fell 0.7 percent in August
over the previous month, while private-company production
dropped for a third month, declining 15 percent, the central
bank reported yesterday on its website. Oil exports account for
about a quarter of the nation’s revenue.  Ecuador remains under a state of emergency after police
demonstrating against wage cuts Sept. 30 took President  Rafael Correa  hostage to demand changes to a new public service law. A
subsequent gunfight between the police and security forces loyal
to Correa, as well as related violence across the country, left
eight people dead and 274 injured.  The government is pushing for alterations to at least 31
laws, including industrial, financial, labor, water and land
regulations,  Fernando Cordero , president of the country’s
congress, said Aug. 24.  Public support for the government after the protests has
given leaders “more energy to deepen changes,” central bank
President  Diego Borja  said Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
