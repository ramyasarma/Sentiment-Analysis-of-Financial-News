As many as 25 members of the
Tajikistan military may have been killed in a helicopter crash
that could have been the result of a missile attack by Islamist
rebels, Agence France-Presse reported, citing unidentified
military officials.  The incident occurred following an increase in Islamist
unrest in the east of the central Asia country, where 28
soldiers were killed last month in an ambush, the news service
said.  The country’s national guard said in a statement that four
members of the helicopter crew were killed and three wounded
when the aircraft hit a power line and crashed into a river, AFP
said.  A high-ranking Tajik military official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said 18 members of the country’s elite
Alfa military division were killed in the crash as well as seven
of the national guard, the news service said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
