Emerging-market stocks rose for a
sixth day, set for the longest-winning streak in more than two
months, amid speculation governments will step up efforts to
stoke growth after Japan’s interest rate cut.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  climbed 1 percent to
1,107.97 at 12:34 p.m. in Singapore, set for the highest level

and South Korea’s Kospi index advanced 1.1 percent, while the

rally since November 2006.  “Everybody is coming back to the markets now, you have to
be more positive about the growth prospects,” said Lye Thim

from low interest rates.”  The Bank of Japan yesterday unexpectedly cut interest rates
to as low as zero and said it would buy as much as $60 billion
of assets to keep the economy from faltering. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on Oct. 4 that the central bank
aided the U.S. economy through its $1.75 trillion purchases of
mortgage debt and Treasuries that ended in March 2010 and that
further buying would likely help more.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rallied 17 percent last
quarter, the most in a year, on speculation developing nations
will be able to sustain their recovery and that central banks
around the world may be prepared to take more measures to spur
growth.  S&P Jumps  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 2.1 percent yesterday
in New York after the Institute for Supply Management’s index of
 non-manufacturing  businesses, which covers about 90 percent of
the world’s largest economy, increased to 53.2 in September from
51.5 in August. The  median forecast  of 76 economists surveyed by

signal growth.  India’s benchmark  Sensitive Index  gained 0.8 percent and
the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  rose 0.4 percent, set for its
highest close since January 2008.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world’s largest shipyard,
climbed 6.9 percent to 331,500 won after the company received an
order to build four very large crude carriers from SK Shipping
Co. Separately, the stock was raised to “buy” from “neutral”
at UBS AG, with a share-price estimate of 420,000 won.  PT Harum Energy  surged on debut after raising 2.86 trillion
rupiah ($321 million) in an initial share sale, the biggest by a
coal company in Indonesia in two years. The stock climbed 7.7
percent to 5,600 rupiah a share in Jakarta trading, after
gaining as much as 20 percent earlier.  PT Timah  shares climbed 3.2 percent after tin futures rose
