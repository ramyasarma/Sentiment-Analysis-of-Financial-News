Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will seek to change the nation’s citizenship oath to
specify that Israel is a Jewish state, an Israeli government
official said today. The change requires approval from
Netanyahu’s Cabinet and the Parliament.  Netanyahu has demanded that Palestinians recognize Israel
as a Jewish state. Palestinian leaders say they won’t. The
announcement comes two days before Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas plans to ask approval from the Arab
League to halt peace talks with Israel because of a dispute over
West Bank settlement construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
