London luxury-home values fell for a
third straight month in September as purchasers were deterred by
the prices being sought by vendors,  Knight Frank LLP  said.  Prices of houses and apartments costing 1 million pounds
($1.6 million) or more slipped 0.2 percent from August, paring
the annual gain to 15 percent, the smallest since January, the
London-based property broker said in a statement today.  “There is a more cautious approach from potential buyers”
after gains of 23 percent in the past 18 months,  Liam Bailey ,
Knight Frank’s head of residential research, said in the
statement. “Looking ahead, the danger for vendors is in overly
ambitious pricing. Most agents confirm that asking prices are
currently 5 percent to 10 percent above realistic levels.”  Low interest rates and a weakening of the pound lured
foreign buyers to London last year after 15 months of declines
in the value of the U.K. capital’s most expensive properties.
That prompted more owners to put homes on sale and helped to
close the gap between demand and supply.  The number of new buyers coming into the market fell 13
percent from a year earlier, while the number of properties for
sale rose by the same amount, Knight Frank said.  “The market has begun to shift slowly in favor of the
buyer,” Bailey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
