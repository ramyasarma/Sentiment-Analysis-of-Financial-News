Emirates Integrated Telecommunication
Co.,  the Dubai-based phone company known as Du, obtained $255
million in financing from the Export-Import Bank of China as it
seeks to repay debts and upgrade its network.  The loan, which is backed by Chinese export credit agency
Sinosure, will be used to repay a short-term facility of $85
million and purchase equipment to expand 3G network, the company
said in a statement to the Dubai bourse today.  “The agreement will enable Du to turn its three-year short-
term borrowings into a more efficient seven-year facility, based
on a two-year drawdown and five-year repayment plan,” the
company said.  Du plans to spend at least 2.2 billion dirhams this year
and about the same amount in 2011, Chief Executive Officer  Osman Sultan  said in May. The company said in June it sold 1 billion
dirhams of new stock to existing investors, raising cash to
expand. Du last month obtained a $207 million export credit
facility backed by German ECA Euler Hermes to help roll out 2G
and 3G networks.  Du’s profit more than doubled in the second quarter from
the year-earlier period as its client base grew. Shares of the
company, which competes with  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. ,
surged 32 percent in the third quarter and closed at 2.67
dirhams on the Dubai bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
