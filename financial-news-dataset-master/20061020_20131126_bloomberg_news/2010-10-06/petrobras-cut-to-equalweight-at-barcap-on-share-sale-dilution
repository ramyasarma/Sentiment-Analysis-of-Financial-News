Petroleo Brasileiro SA  plunged the
most in three weeks in Sao Paulo after Barclays Plc cut its
rating on the stock, saying low oil prices may force Brazil’s
state-controlled crude producer to sell more shares.  Petrobras, as the company is known, lost 4.2 percent to
25.86 reais as 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest decline since
Sept. 14. The stock was lowered to “equalweight” from
“overweight” at Barclays, which said Petrobras may need to
sell additional equity as soon as 2013 should oil prices average
below $80 a barrel. Petrobras sold a record $70 billion of
shares last month.  “There are reasonable concerns that the next
administration will further increase the use of Petrobras as the
tool for the country’s bigger economic and social development,”
 Paul Y. Cheng , a New York-based analyst with Barclays, wrote in
a report today. That will “likely lead to lower future return
for Petrobras’s minority shareholders over the next several
years.”  The stock’s  26 percent tumble  this year before today has
failed to make its valuation “compelling,” Barclays said.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA  reduced its recommendation on
Petrobras yesterday, saying earnings will be diluted by last
month’s stock sale. UBS AG suggested selling Petrobras in August
for the same reason.  The government boosted its stake in Petrobras to 48 percent
of the company from 40 percent before the offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
