Ghana’s  statistics agency will
release revised economic growth figures for the past four years,
following a plan to re-calculate the way gross domestic product
is valued in the West African nation.  The data may mean the economy, which will grow by 5.9
percent this year with gross domestic product of $17.95 billion
according to an estimate made using the current base, is “40 to
50 percent bigger than previously thought,” said Wayne Mitchell,
the International Monetary Fund’s resident representative in
phone interview from the capital, Accra, today.  The revised figures will be released before the finance
ministry announces its budget for 2011, likely in mid-November,
said Bernice Ofosu-Baadu, the Ghana Statistical Service’s head
of national accounts and economic indicators.  The reference year has been updated to 2006, from 1993, and
industries such as communications and financial services are
being separated from other groups, she said in a phone interview
yesterday.  The statistical agency will also begin quarterly reporting
of economic growth figures, Ofosu-Baadu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
