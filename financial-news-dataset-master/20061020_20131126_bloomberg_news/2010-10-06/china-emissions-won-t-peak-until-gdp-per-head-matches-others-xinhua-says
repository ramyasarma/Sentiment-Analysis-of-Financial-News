 China’s greenhouse gas emissions are
unlikely to peak before its per capita GDP reached $40,000, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, citing Xie Zhenhua, the
country’s top climate change official.  China’s current per capita GDP just exceeds $3,000, the news
agency said. Developed countries with per capita GDP more than
$40,000 are still increasing greenhouse gas emissions, Xie said,
according to Xinhua.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
