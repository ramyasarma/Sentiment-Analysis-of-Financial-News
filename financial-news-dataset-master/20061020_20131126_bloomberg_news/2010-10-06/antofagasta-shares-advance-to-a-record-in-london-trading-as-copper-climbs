Antofagasta Plc , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, rose to a record in London
trading as a slumping dollar lifted prices for the metal to the
highest level in almost 27 months.  Antofagasta gained 44 pence, or 3.5 percent, to 1,313 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading. The climb increased
the company’s market value to 12.9 billion pounds ($20.5
billion) and extended this year’s gain to 32 percent.  “The weak dollar is benefiting the copper market and
copper prices,”  Charles Kernot , an analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in London, said by phone. “That’s helping the
copper producers’ shares.”  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange added as much as 1.8 percent to $8,326 a metric ton,
the highest level since July 14, 2008. Prices climbed on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will take more steps to
spur the U.S. economy, weighing on the dollar.  A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals cheaper
in terms of other monies. The Fed bought $1.75 trillion of
mortgage debt and Treasuries from August 2008 through March of
this year in an effort to boost growth through so-called
quantitative easing. The Bank of Japan said yesterday it will
set up a $60 billion fund to buy assets.  “There are lots of discussions of quantitative easing
taking place at the moment, so investors are pricing commodities
and pricing the dollar accordingly,” Kernot said.  Kazakhmys Plc , Kazakhstan’s biggest copper-mining company,
rose 3.9 percent in London. Xstrata Plc, the world’s fourth-
biggest producer of the metal, added 3.8 percent.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. , the largest mining company, gained 3 percent, and Rio
Tinto Group, which ranks third, climbed 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
