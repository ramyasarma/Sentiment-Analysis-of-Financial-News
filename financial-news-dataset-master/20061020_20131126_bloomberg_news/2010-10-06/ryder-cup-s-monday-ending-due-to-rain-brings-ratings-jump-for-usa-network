USA Network’s coverage of the
final day of the Ryder Cup attracted 23 percent more
viewers than the channel’s typical Monday morning
programming, owner  NBC Universal Inc.  said.  The 0.65 rating compares with an average 0.53 rating
for the channel’s three previous Monday mornings, NBC
spokesman  Chris McCloskey  said.  For the first time in the 83-year history of the
biennial Ryder Cup, played between golf teams from the U.S.
and Europe, inclement weather forced a fourth day of
competition.  The last day of Europe’s 14 1/2 to 13 1/2 victory at
Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales, was broadcast in the U.S.
from 4 a.m. to 11 a.m. eastern time on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
