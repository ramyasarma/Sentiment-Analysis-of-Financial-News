European stocks climbed amid
speculation that central banks around the world will follow the
Bank of Japan in announcing measures to boost their economies.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group rose 3 percent and
3.5 percent, respectively, as commodities increased in London.
EasyJet Plc soared 12 percent, the largest gain since January
2009, after saying full-year profit beat its forecast.  Saipem
SpA  gained 3.8 percent as Citigroup Inc. recommended buying the
shares. ElringKlinger AG sank 6.5 percent, the most in more than
four months, as the company sold new shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 0.5 percent to 262.51 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has rallied 13 percent
since its low this year in May as investors speculated that the
global economy will avoid another recession. Still, concern that
peripheral euro-area countries will struggle to repay their debt
has left the gauge 3.5 percent below its April high for 2010.  “Central banks are trying to put a floor under a
struggling economy,”  Adrian van Tiggelen , chief strategist at
ING Investment Management in The Hague, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown” with  Maryam Nemazee .
“Equities can also benefit to a certain extent from this
liquidity creation.”  European stocks pared their advance after data from a
private payrolls report showed that companies in the U.S.
unexpectedly cut workers in September. Employment decreased by
39,000, according to figures today from ADP Employer Services.
The median estimate of 37 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a gain of 20,000.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the U.S. economy likely will
be “fairly bad” or “very bad” over the next six to nine months
and the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth
forecast.  Japanese Easing  The Japanese central bank’s unexpected decision yesterday
to drop its interest rate to “virtually zero” and expand its
balance sheet follows the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move toward
more unconventional easing. Bank of England officials will
consider further stimulus tomorrow, while the central banks of
Australia, Canada and New Zealand have stopped increasing
interest rates.  National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European
markets except Sweden. Germany’s  DAX Index  gained 0.9 percent,
while France’s  CAC 40 Index  also jumped 0.9 percent. The U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index increased 0.8 percent.  Mining Stocks  BHP Billiton,  the world’s biggest mining company , rose 3
percent to 2,137.5 pence. Rio Tinto, the third-largest, jumped
3.5 percent to 3,926 pence. Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc

Luksic family, climbed 3.5 percent to 1,313 pence, the highest
price since it first sold shares to the public in 1989. European

among 19 industry groups.  Alpha Bank SA  increased 6.5 percent to 5.28 euros, while

5.3 percent to 5 euros.  Piraeus Bank SA  surged 4.2 percent to

to 1,552.55, the gauge’s biggest gain in more than two months.  ThyssenKrupp AG  climbed 1.8 percent to 24.93 euros.
Germany’s largest steelmaker anticipates a pretax profit of
about 1 billion euros ($1.39 billion) in the fiscal year through
September, Handelsblatt reported, citing Chief Executive Officer
 Ekkehard Schulz . The steelmaker cut costs to recover from a
pretax loss of 2.4 billion euros a year earlier, the newspaper
said.  Volkswagen AG  rose 1.2 percent to 84.95 euros as Europe’s
largest carmaker said it may produce a mid-sized sedan, which it
designed for U.S. customers, in China in a bid to win buyers in
the world’s biggest auto market.  EasyJet, BA  EasyJet  surged 12 percent to 433.3 pence as Europe’s
second-biggest discount airline said pretax profit for the 12
months to Sept. 30 was “slightly ahead” of its 150 million-
pound ($238.55 million) top-end forecast because of increased
demand for flights to beach resorts and cities and lower-than-
expected losses from the Icelandic ash cloud.  British Airways Plc, Europe’s third-largest airline,
climbed 4.5 percent to 266.1 pence, while  Ryanair Holdings Plc ,
the region’s largest discount airline, gained 1.4 percent to
4.07 euros.  Improved Demand  British Airways Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  said
he sees no evidence that the economy is headed toward another
recession and that demand has “improved” from a year ago,
albeit from a “very low base.”  Ferrovial SA  jumped 3.2 percent to 7.41 euros, the shares’
highest price since April. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
agreed to buy an additional 10 percent stake in the 407 Express
Toll Route near Toronto from Ferrovial for C$894 million ($884.1
million).  Saipem  added 3.8 percent to 31.26 euros, the highest price
since November 2007. Europe’s largest oilfield-services provider
was raised to “buy” from “sell” at Citigroup.  Autonomy Corp. , the U.K.’s second-largest software company,
sank 16 percent to 1,551 pence, its largest drop since April
2008, after lowering its forecast for full-year revenue by about
3 percent. The company forecast it will now increase sales by 17
percent over the full year.  ElringKlinger  slumped 6.5 percent to 22.39 euros as the
company raised 123.8 million euros by selling new shares without
subscription rights at 21.50 euros apiece. The company said it
plans to use the proceeds “mainly for the purpose of
financing” growth.  Ericsson AB  fell 2.6 percent to 72 kronor. Royal Bank of
Canada cut its estimate for third-quarter sales at the world’s
biggest maker of mobile-phone networks to 46 billion kronor
($6.86 billion) from 50 billion kronor, saying “currency
impact, lingering component shortages and the lack of
improvement in emerging markets may point to underwhelming
results for Ericsson in the near term.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
