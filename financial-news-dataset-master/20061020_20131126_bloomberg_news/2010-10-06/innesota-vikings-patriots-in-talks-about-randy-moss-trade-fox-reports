The Minnesota Vikings are in talks to
reacquire wide receiver  Randy Moss  in a trade from the New
England Patriots,  FoxSports.com reported .  Moss, 33, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, was a first-
round draft pick by the Vikings in 1998 and spent seven years in
Minnesota before going to Oakland in 2005. He was traded to the
Patriots in 2007 and had a National Football League-record 23
touchdown receptions that season. He has said this year that he
is underappreciated by the Patriots.  Moss has 151 touchdown catches, putting him second on the
NFL career list behind  Jerry Rice’s  197. He has 935 receptions
for 14,604 yards.  Vikings wide receiver  Sidney Rice  will miss at least the
first six weeks of the season with a hip injury, while  Percy Harvin  is struggling with migraine headaches, the Associated
Press reported, in part accounting for the 1-2 start by
Minnesota and quarterback  Brett Favre .  To contact the reporter on this story:
