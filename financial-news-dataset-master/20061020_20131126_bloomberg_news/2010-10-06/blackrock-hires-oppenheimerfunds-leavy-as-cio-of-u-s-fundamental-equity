BlackRock Inc. , the world’s largest
asset-management firm, hired  Christopher Leavy  as chief
investment officer of U.S. fundamental equity, a newly created
position.  Leavy, previously CIO of equities at OppenheimerFunds Inc.,
will oversee $150 billion in actively managed U.S. stock assets,
New York-based BlackRock said today in a statement. He will
report to  Quintin Price , the global investment chief for
fundamental equities and the head of that business.  BlackRock, with $3.15 trillion under management as of June
30, runs a combination of passive funds that track market and
industry indexes and active strategies in which managers pick
securities based on their research. Its equity assets include
about $1.09 trillion in passive products such as exchange-traded
funds and $291 billion in active funds.  Leavy’s hire will help BlackRock “as we seek to enhance
our fundamental equity unit,” Price said in the statement.  Before being named head of equities at New York-based
OppenheimerFunds, Leavy managed the unit that picked value
stocks, or those deemed cheap relative to financial yardsticks,
from 2000 to 2006.  OppenheimerFunds earlier today named Art
Steinmetz CIO of the asset-management firm, expanding his role
with Leavy’s departure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
