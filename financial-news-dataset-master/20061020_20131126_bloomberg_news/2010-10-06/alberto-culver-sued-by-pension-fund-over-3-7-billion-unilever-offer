Alberto-Culver Co. , the maker of VO5,
Nexxus and TRESemme hair-care products, was sued by a pension
fund that contends  Unilever ’s planned $3.7 billion takeover will
shortchange investors.  Alberto-Culver directors are obligated to get the highest
price for the stock, attorneys for the Laborers Local 235
Benefits Fund said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The process leading up to the board’s decision to agree
to the proposed transaction was severely flawed, and not in any
way designed to elicit the most economically favorable
transaction for Alberto-Culver’s shareholders,”  John Kairis , a
lawyer for the fund, wrote in the complaint.  Unilever, the maker of Dove soap, agreed to pay $37.50 a
share in cash for Alberto-Culver, based in Melrose Park,
Illinois. That’s about 19 percent more than the Sept. 24 closing
price. The companies agreed to a $125 million fee if the deal is
terminated.  The board “further reduced the possibility of a maximizing
shareholder value by agreeing to a punitive $125 million
termination fee,” according to the complaint.  Dan Stone , a spokesman for Alberto-Culver, said the company
hadn’t seen the complaint and he couldn’t immediately comment.  The case is Laborers Local 235 Benefits Fund v. Lavin,
CA5873, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
