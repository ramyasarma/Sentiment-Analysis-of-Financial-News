U.K. prosecutors arrested two people
and conducted nine raids today in an investigation into the
“alleged corrupt role” by employees of  Securency International
PTY Ltd . to secure contracts for international polymer
banknotes.  Securency International is a joint venture between the
Reserve Bank of Australia, the country’s central bank, and
Innovia Films, a Cumbria, England-based company that makes
cellulose films for packaging and labels, according to  its
website . Securency markets a polymer substrate used in
banknotes.  Spanish authorities executed two search warrants relating
to three British nationals in Spain, and six residential
premises were searched in Australia, the U.K. Serious Fraud
Office said today  in a statement . The SFO, which searched eight
homes and a commercial building, is investigating the Securency
employees and agents along with Australian Federal Police.  More than 80 SFO employees, along with British police,
conducted the searches this morning, the agency said.  A call and e-mail to Securency after normal business hours
weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter for this story:
