Bank of India  has applied for a New
Zealand banking license, according to Banking Day, an industry
newsletter.  The Mumbai-based bank hopes to get its license from the
central bank in the next few months, the newsletter reported
today, citing an unidentified official at the International
Department in Mumbai. It has no plans to set up in Australia,
Banking Day said.  The bank will operate as a locally incorporated subsidiary,
the newsletter said. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand encourages
banks to become locally incorporated entities to ensure a clear
line of separation from the parent, the newsletter said.  The Reserve Bank doesn’t comment on individual applications,
 Mike Hannah , a spokesman in Wellington, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter for this story:
