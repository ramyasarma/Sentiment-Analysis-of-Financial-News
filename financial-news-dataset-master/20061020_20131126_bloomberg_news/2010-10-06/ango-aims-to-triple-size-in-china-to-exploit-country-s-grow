Mango, the closely held Spanish
clothing retailer, will add as many as 220 stores in China in
2011 as it seeks to more than triple the proportion of sales it
gets from the country in the next three years.  The  company  will aim to add one outlet about every day-and-
a-half to its 100 stores in the country, said Isak Halfon,
Mango’s expansion director. About 10 percent of sales will come
from China by 2013, up from 3 percent now, he said.  “China is growing incredibly fast and has the most
potential for store openings,” Halfon said, adding that at
least 200 Mango outlets will open there next year.  China’s economy has expanded more than 90-fold in the past
three decades, luring international retailers such as  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. ,  Carrefour SA  and Inditex SA’s Zara. Mango, whose
clothing is modelled by actress  Scarlett Johansson , opened its
first store in the country in 2002 and created a distribution
hub in Shanghai in 2006, helping promote expansion.  Halfon said it’s easier to open stores in China than when
the retailer first entered the country, helped by the rebranding
of its MNG outlets there as Mango in 2005. Stores in Hong Kong
and Macau also helped familiarity with the brand, he said.  The Spanish retailer, which opened its first store in
Barcelona in 1984, has 15 outlets in Singapore and 12 in India
and plans to open more in both countries, Halfon said.  About 60 percent of Mango’s 1,600 stores are  franchises  and
it owns the remainder.  Franchisees  can return goods that aren’t
sold and Mango puts those items on sale at its stores.  Shifting Production  The company purchases about 45 percent of goods from China
and can move production to countries including Indonesia,
Turkey, Vietnam and Morocco should raw material and labor costs
increase, Halfon said. Mango, which  sells  trench coats for less
than 100 euros ($138) and leather coats for 879 euros, says its
customers have been willing to pay more for higher quality.  Mango, which started selling clothing on the Internet in
2000, aims to increase revenue from that channel to 7 percent of
total sales from about 1 percent by 2013, Halfon said.  The retailer aims to boost sales to 1.8 billion euros by
2013 from 1.48 billion last year, when 78 percent of revenue was
from its international stores, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
