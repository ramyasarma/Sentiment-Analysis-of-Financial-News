Chile’s peso gained for the 11th time
in 12 days as the price of copper, the country’s biggest export,
rose and the euro appreciated against the U.S. dollar after a
drop in U.S. private payrolls.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 482.55 per dollar at 1:58 p.m.
New York time, from 483.05 yesterday.  The euro reached $1.3948, the highest since February, and
copper on the Comex in New York gained as much as 1.7 percent to
$3.7895 a pound, the highest level since July 2008. The
unexpected 39,000 decline in U.S. private payrolls fueled
speculation the Federal Reserve may start a second round of
quantitative easing, buying assets to boost inflation.  “On days when the euro rises and copper rises, there’s
pressure on the peso to appreciate as well,” said  Maria Jesus Bofill , an economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in
Santiago. “The market has also accepted that the current levels
aren’t going to bring intervention from the central bank. We’re
close, but we’re not there yet.”  Interest-rate  swap yields  fell as traders reduced bets on
interest-rate increases. Minutes from last month’s central bank
meeting, published yesterday, showed that in September the bank
considered slowing the pace of rate rises because the increasing
currency and lower inflation readings in developed countries
reduced the risk of importing inflation.  Since then, the currency has appreciated 3.3 percent and
inflation expectations have fallen.  Economic growth  was slower
than expected in August, the central bank said yesterday, adding
to speculation that the bank may restrict itself to a 25 basis-
point rate increase in October.  The one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ estimates of the likely average cost of borrowing over
the next 12 months, dropped six basis points to 3.76 percent.
The two-year rate dropped five basis points to 4.13 percent.
Those are the lowest yields since Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
