Poland, Brazil and the Czech Republic
are among 10 developing nations “on their way to graduate to
the developed world” because of their fiscal consolidation and
reduced reliance on external funding,  Barclays Capital  said.  Singapore, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, China and
South Africa were also named “advanced developed markets” with
risks similar to developed nations and higher returns, Barclays
analysts said in a report dated Oct. 5.  Permanent changes in monetary and fiscal policies boosted
the countries’ macroeconomic stability and credibility and made
them less vulnerable from external shocks,  Eduardo Levy-Yeyati 
in New York and  Piero Ghezzi  in London wrote in the note.  “The global crisis marked a turning point in the way
financial markets think of the economies grouped under the
emerging-markets umbrella,” the analysts wrote. The 10
countries “showed a growing distance from the high-risk stakes
stereotypes of the 1990s” and now offer “a future of solid
growth without the volatility and tail risk characteristic of
the original emerging-market countries,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
