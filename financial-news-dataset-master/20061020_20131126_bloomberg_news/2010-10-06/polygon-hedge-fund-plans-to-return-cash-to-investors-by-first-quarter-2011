Polygon Investment Partners LLP, a
London-based hedge-fund firm run by  Reade Griffith  and  Paddy Dear , will return all investors’ money in its Global
Opportunities fund by March 31.  Investors, including UBS AG, dropped a petition that in
August asked a Cayman Islands court to appoint an independent
liquidator for the fund, according to an Oct. 4 letter signed by
Griffith and Dear that was sent to clients.  The Polygon Global Opportunities Master Fund, which managed
about $8 billion at its peak, has returned about 60 percent of
its assets to investors since being shut in late 2008. It lost
almost half its assets as convertible bonds, loans and stocks
tumbled in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy.  About half of the current $1.2 billion in the fund is in
easier-to-sell assets that will be liquidated between now and
the end of the first quarter. The remainder is in more illiquid
assets that will be sold by auction by the beginning of 2011,
according to the letter. Investors will have the option of
getting all their money back, or keeping their stake in the
harder-to-sell investments, which will be put into a new fund
managed by the Polygon team.  Jonathan Gasthalter , a spokesman for Polygon, declined to
comment on the letter.  Polygon now manages two new funds, the Convertible
Opportunity Fund, which has climbed 19 percent this year through
September, according to the letter, and the European Equity
Opportunity fund, which is up 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
