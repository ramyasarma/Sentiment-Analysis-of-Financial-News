Belgium risks missing its deficit
target by about half a percentage point of gross domestic
product next year as the collapse of coalition talks hampers
drawing up a 2011 budget.  The deficit will narrow to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2011 from
4.8 percent this year, according to the latest government
 projections , Budget Minister  Guy Vanhengel  and State Secretary
 Melchior Wathelet  told reporters in Brussels today. That would
leave Belgium about 1.8 billion euros ($2.5 billion) short of a
target to trim the deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP next year, as
agreed with the European Commission.  Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  said in an interview with
public broadcaster VRT yesterday that he has no plans to start
drawing up a 2011 budget, urging the country’s party leaders to
form a coalition almost four months after deadlocked elections.
Leterme’s federal government remains confined to a caretaker
role after Flemish nationalist N-VA party pulled out of
coalition talks this week, deepening the political stalemate.  “Additional measures are absolutely necessary to remain on
track with the stability program,” Vanhengel said after a so-
called inner cabinet meeting. “The sooner a new government can
be installed, the better off we’ll be.”  Lower Bond Yields  Lower bond yields will lead to interest-expense savings of
336 million euros this year compared with earlier projections,
Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said at the briefing. Belgium
already completed the funding program for 2010 and has started
prefinancing its 2011 borrowing requirements, he said.  Belgium’s  benchmark  10-year yields declined 4 basis points
to 3.11 percent as of 2:19 p.m. local time. That compares with
3.71 percent at the end of last year and an average of 4.23
percent in the past decade, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 10-year rate reached a  record low  of 2.79 percent
on Aug. 31.  Belgium’s federal government and social security will face
a budget shortfall of 3.8 percent of GDP next year, narrowing
from an estimated 3.9 percent this year, according to the latest
projections. Adding the estimated shortfall at the level of the
country’s regions and local authorities would result in a
deficit of 4.6 percent next year, according to Wathelet.  The latest government projections assume economic growth
will slow to 1.7 percent next year from 1.8 percent in 2010,
with inflation decelerating to 2 percent from 2.1 percent.  The European Union has given Belgium until the end of 2012
to bring the deficit back under the bloc’s ceiling of 3 percent.
The country, whose  public debt  is projected to surpass gross
domestic product this year or the next, plans to balance its
budget in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
