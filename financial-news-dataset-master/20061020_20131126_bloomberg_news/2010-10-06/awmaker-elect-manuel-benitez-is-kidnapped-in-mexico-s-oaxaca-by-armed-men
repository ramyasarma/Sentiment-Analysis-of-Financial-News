A lawmaker-elect in Mexico’s Oaxaca
state was kidnapped late yesterday, said Manuel Hernandez,
spokesman for the state’s public security ministry.  Manuel Benitez, who was elected in July and is due to take
power in December, was driving his vehicle in the town of 
Zimatlan de Alvarez when armed men abducted him, Hernandez said.
Police haven’t had any communication with the kidnappers, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
