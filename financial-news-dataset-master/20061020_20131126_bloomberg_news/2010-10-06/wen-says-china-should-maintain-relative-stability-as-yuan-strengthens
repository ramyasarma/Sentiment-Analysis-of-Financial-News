Chinese Prime Minister  Wen Jiabao 
said his government should maintain “relative stability” for
the yuan and will “gradually” increase flexibility in the
exchange rate.  “We will reform, which is for sure,” Wen said today at an
event in Brussels. “We’ll gradually increase the flexibility of
yuan exchange rates. But on the other side we should also
maintain relative stability of the currency,” he said.  “If yuan’s not stable it’ll bring disaster to China and
the world,” wen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
