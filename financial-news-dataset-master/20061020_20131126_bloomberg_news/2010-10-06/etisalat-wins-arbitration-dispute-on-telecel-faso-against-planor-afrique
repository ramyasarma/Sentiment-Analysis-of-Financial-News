Emirates Telecommunications Corp. ,
the Middle East’s largest phone company, said it won an
arbitration dispute related to its Burkina Faso subsidiary
Telecel Faso.  A tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce in
Paris upheld Etisalat’s claims that the memorandum of agreement
between Etisalat and Planor Afrique Planor in September 2007 to
settle their dispute regarding Telecel Faso was valid, binding
and enforceable and that Planor had breached the accord, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
