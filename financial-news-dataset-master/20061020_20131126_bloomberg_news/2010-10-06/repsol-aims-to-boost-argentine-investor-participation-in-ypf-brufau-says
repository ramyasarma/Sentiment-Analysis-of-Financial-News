Repsol YPF SA aims to sell part of
its stakes in its Argentine unit to local investors, chief
executive officer Antonio Brufau said.  Spain’s largest oil company is seeking Argentine partners
in YPF SA, as the unit is called, either through a private sale
or a share sale, Brufau told reporters in Buenos Aires.  “The thing is it will take time because Argentine is a
difficult place to gather funds and I don’t need investors in
New York, I want local ones,” he said. Repsol owns 84 percent
of YPF and Argentina’s Petersen Group has a 15.4 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
