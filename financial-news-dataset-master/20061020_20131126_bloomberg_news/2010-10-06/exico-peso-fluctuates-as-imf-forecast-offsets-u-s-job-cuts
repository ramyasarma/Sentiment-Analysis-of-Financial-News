Mexico’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, as benchmark government securities in
the U.S. surged, fueling demand for higher-yielding assets.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.35 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, the lowest since the security was issued in
2005. The price of the security rose 0.57 centavo to 134.08
centavos on the peso, according to Banco Santander SA.  “The move is, in part, tied to the spread between the
bonds,” said  Rafael Camarena,  an economist with Banco Santander
SA in Mexico City. “We still also have another few weeks where
we will see foreign inflows because of the World Government Bond
Index.”  Citigroup Inc. added Mexican government peso bonds to its
World Government Bond Index Oct. 1.  U.S. employers cut 39,000 jobs last month, according to
data released by ADP Employer Services. The median estimate of
37 economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a gain of
20,000 jobs. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexican
exports.  The peso was little changed at 12.4762 per dollar, from
12.4753 yesterday. The currency has risen 4.9 percent against
the dollar this year.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the $200 million dollar
options available today, the central bank said on its website.
So far this month, $400 million in dollar options have been
exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
