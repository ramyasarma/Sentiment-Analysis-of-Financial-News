The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development raised its estimate of the combined
growth rate among its 33 members for the second quarter on signs
that investment began picking up for the first time since 2008.  Gross domestic product across OECD countries increased 0.9
percent in the three months through June, the Paris-based
organization said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s up from
the 0.7 percent the OECD estimated on Aug. 18 and the 0.7
percent growth registered in the first quarter.  “Gross fixed investment was the main contributor to the
GDP increase,” according to the statement.  While the overall growth rate has improved, the figures
also underline the diverging performances of the world’s most
developed economies in the wake of the worst recession since
World War II. The expansion slipped to 0.4 percent in the U.S.,
the world’s largest economy, down from the 0.6 percent
originally estimated by the OECD, while output surged 2.2
percent in Germany and 1.2 percent in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
