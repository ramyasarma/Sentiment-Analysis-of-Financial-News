The International Monetary Fund
raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for India, citing
strengthening local consumer demand.  The South Asian nation’s economy will expand 9.7 percent
this year, the  Washington-based lender  said in its World
Economic Outlook yesterday, more than the 9.4 percent the IMF
estimated in July. The fund maintained its 2011 prediction for
India’s growth at 8.4 percent.  “Low reliance on exports, accommodative policies, and
strong capital inflows have supported domestic activity and
growth,” the IMF said in the report. “The rapid pace of
domestic activity, evidenced by rapidly rising inflation, led
the central bank to increase the repo policy rate.”  The Reserve Bank of India has increased its benchmark
 repurchase rate  by 1.25 percentage points this year, the most by
any central bank in Asia, to cool price gains. The IMF forecast
Indian consumer prices may rise 13.2 percent in 2010 compared
with 10.9 percent in 2009.  “We aren’t done yet with interest rate increases as growth
is still quite strong,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist
with New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and
Policy. “The rate cycle is yet to peak” and inflation is still
high, he said.  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices paid by industrial workers in India are
rising faster than 9 percent, the most after flood-hit Pakistan
among the 18 countries in the Asia Pacific tracked by Bloomberg.  India’s  gross domestic product  expanded 8.8 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the most since 2007 and the fastest
pace among major economies after China and Brazil.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond was
little changed at 7.93 percent at 11:30 a.m. in Mumbai while the
rupee traded near a five-month high climbing 0.5 percent to
44.28 per dollar. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s benchmark
 Sensitive Index  fell 0.1 percent to 20,521.57.  The Reserve Bank’s repurchase rate is 6 percent and the
reverse repurchase rate is 5 percent. The  central bank  is
scheduled to issue its next monetary policy statement on Nov. 2.  Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased
India’s economic growth forecast to 8.5 percent from 8.2 percent
for the financial year ending March 31 and estimated inflation
at 6.5 percent, more than its earlier projection of 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
