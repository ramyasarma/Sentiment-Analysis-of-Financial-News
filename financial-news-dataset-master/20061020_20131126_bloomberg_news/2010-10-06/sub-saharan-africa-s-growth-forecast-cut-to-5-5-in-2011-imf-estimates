The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its 2011 growth forecast for Sub-Saharan Africa to 5.5 percent
as the global recovery falters and European governments cut back
on spending, curbing demand for exports.  The Washington-based lender left its growth forecast for
the world’s poorest region this year at 5 percent, according to
its World Economic Outlook. The IMF had previously estimated
growth of 5.9 percent for 2011.  Africa’s growth rate is forecast to almost double this year
as demand from China and India drive up prices of commodities
such as copper and platinum, and exports rebound from last
year’s global recession. That’s being tempered by fiscal
spending cuts in the U.K., Germany and other European nations,
which buy about a third of exports from middle- and low-income
African countries, according to the IMF.  “The primary risk to the outlook for the region is a
faltering global recovery,” the IMF said. “In addition to
these trade linkages, continued weakness and measures to cut
budget deficits in advanced economies may affect the low-income
economies of Sub-Saharan Africa by reducing aid and private
financial flows to the region.”  Global growth will probably slow to 4.2 percent in 2011
from 4.8 percent this year, and the recovery is “neither strong
nor balanced,” the IMF said. In the euro region, growth is
expected to reach 1.7 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent next year.  Ethiopian Boom  Low-income countries, such as Ethiopia, Tanzania and
Uganda, will drive growth in the Sub-Saharan Africa next year,
the IMF said. Ethiopia, which devalued its currency for a third
time in 14 months in September, will probably grow 8.5 percent
in 2011 from 8 percent this year, the IMF said.  Tanzania’s growth is forecast to accelerate to 6.7 percent
from 6.5 percent in 2010, while Uganda’s economy is estimated to
expand 6.1 percent next year, up from 5.8 percent.  “Growth in low-income economies is generally expected to
be driven as much by domestic factors as by the global
recovery,” the IMF said.  Oil-exporting nations will probably expand 6.7 percent this
year and 7 percent in 2011, led by rising output in Republic of
Congo, Angola and Nigeria, the IMF said. Nigeria, Africa’s
second-biggest economy and its most populous nation, is forecast
to expand 7.4 percent in 2011, the same pace as this year, the
IMF said.  South Africa’s  economy , the biggest on the continent, will
probably expand 3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2011,
compared with a contraction of 1.8 percent in 2009, the IMF
said. The central bank expects 2.8 percent growth in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
