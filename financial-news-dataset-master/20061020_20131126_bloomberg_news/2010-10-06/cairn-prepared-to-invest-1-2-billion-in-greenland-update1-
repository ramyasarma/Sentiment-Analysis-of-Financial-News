Cairn Energy Plc , the explorer
selling its Indian operations to Vedanta Resources Plc, is
prepared to invest $1.2 billion to drill 10 to 12 wells in
Greenland, Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Mike Watts  said.  “One commercial discovery will transform the region,”
Watts said at a conference hosted by RBC Capital Markets in
London today. The company will spend about $100 million on each
well, he said.  The territory’s waters may hold 50 billion barrels of crude
and gas, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates.  Exxon Mobil Corp. 
and Chevron Corp. also own rights in Greenland, the island
Danish territory. Cairn, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, is
spending $400 million this year to drill four wells there.  The explorer announced last month that it had encountered
two different types of oil, as well as gas, at its Alpha-1S1
well. It is unlikely that other companies will begin drilling in
the region for the next two to three years, Watts said. “That
doesn’t concern us at all. We knew we had the jump.”  Cairn  rose  7.3 pence, or 1.6 percent, to 452.3 pence as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The stock has advanced 36 percent
this year, valuing the company at 6.3 billion pounds ($10
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
