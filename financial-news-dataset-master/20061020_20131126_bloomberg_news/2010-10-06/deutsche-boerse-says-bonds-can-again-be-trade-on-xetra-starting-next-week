Deutsche Boerse AG said bond trading
is to restart on the Xetra electronic trading platform, after a
court lifted an interim injunction. About 700 corporate bonds
will again be tradable on Xetra as of Oct. 11, 2010, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
