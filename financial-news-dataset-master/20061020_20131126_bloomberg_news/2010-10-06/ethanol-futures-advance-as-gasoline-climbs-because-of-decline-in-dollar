Ethanol futures rose in Chicago,
following crude oil and gasoline, as the dollar plunged to a 15-
year low against the yen.  The biofuel increased as the dollar weakened on speculation
that the Federal Reserve will buy assets to spur growth in the
U.S. economy. A weaker  greenback  prompts investors to target
commodities as a hedge against inflation.  “It’s overanticipation of inflation,” said  Peyton Feltus ,
president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in Dallas. “We’re in
an era of unusual things affecting our energy prices. Anything
that’s bullish for gasoline is bullish for ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery advanced 2.7 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $1.944 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The October contract expired yesterday.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast soared
7.5 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.15 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive rose 3 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.045, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in New York added 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$2.135 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the grain-based fuel gained
1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.16.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 41 cents to $83.23 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since May 3. Futures are up 17 percent from this time
last year.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 3.04 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.1559 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
