Alcatel-Lucent SA , France’s biggest
phone equipment maker, expects China and India to be “very
attractive” markets for the company as the world’s two most
populous nations add more phone users and upgrade networks.  “Asia, for the telecom market, is to a large extent what
happens in China and India,” Chief Executive Officer  Ben Verwaayen  said in a Bloomberg Television interview from Kuala
Lumpur today. He didn’t provide a forecast.  Verwaayen is seeking to reverse a decline in sales in China,
the world’s biggest phone market by users, which led Alcatel-
Lucent to a wider-than-expected loss last quarter. In August,
the Paris-based company said it won an order from China Telecom
Corp., the country’s biggest fixed-line carrier.  Revenue from the Asia-Pacific region fell 26 percent to 641
million euros ($887 million) in the second quarter as orders
from China dropped, Alcatel-Lucent reported in July. Sales in
India increased in the period, Verwaayen said today.  In June, Verwaayen said Alcatel-Lucent may put more than
$500 million into a new software and services headquarters in
India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
