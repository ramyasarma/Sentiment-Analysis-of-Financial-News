The Carolina Panthers signed former
New York Jets wide receiver David Clowney, the National Football
League team said.  Clowney, 25, will take the roster spot of Dwayne Jarrett,
who was cut after being arrested and charged with driving while
intoxicated yesterday for the second time in three years.  Clowney had 16 receptions for 239 yards in three seasons
with New York. He was released Oct. 4 to make room for receiver
Santonio Holmes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
