Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris
said Vimpelcom Ltd is now a negotiator in Orascom Telecom
Holding SAE’s talks with the Algerian government over the sale
of its Djezzy unit in the North African country.  “In relation to the Algerian situation, as the agreement
has been signed, Vimpelcom now has crucial saying in all
negotiations,” Sawiris said in a text message today.  Plans by VimpelCom Ltd., owner of Russia’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, to combine assets with Sawiris’s stake in
Orascom may enable Russia to mediate in a disagreement over
taxes and ownership of Orascom’s Algerian operations, Sawiris
said yesterday at a press conference in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
