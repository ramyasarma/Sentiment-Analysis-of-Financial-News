Latvia’s coalition government will
probably remain unchanged after its three parties won a majority
of seats in parliament in Oct. 2 elections, Prime Minister
 Valdis Dombrovskis  said today.  “The most likely model will be the current coalition,”
Dombrovskis on the Latvian television program 900 Seconds.
Harmony Center, which finished second and represents Latvia’s
Russian-speaking minority, “has been offered a cooperation
agreement,” he said.  Such an agreement would allow Harmony to run some
parliamentary committees and may give the party control of a
ministry, Dombrovskis said. Cooperating with Harmony would
“ensure more stability and broader support” for future budget
measures, Dombrovskis said.  The three coalition parties, won 63 seats in the 100-member
legislature, up from 45 in the last parliament. Latvia, which
has cut wages, slashed spending and raised taxes to meet the
terms of a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) loan program led by
the International Monetary Fund, plans more austerity measures
in 2011 and 2012 so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
