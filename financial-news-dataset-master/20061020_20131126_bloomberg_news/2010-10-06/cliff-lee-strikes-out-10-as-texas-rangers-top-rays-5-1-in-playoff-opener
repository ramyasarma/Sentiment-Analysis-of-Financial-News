Cliff Lee  continued his
postseason dominance as the Texas Rangers beat the Tampa
Bay Rays 5-1 to open Major League Baseball’s divisional
playoffs.  Lee, who went 4-0 during last year’s postseason while
with the Philadelphia Phillies, struck out 10 batters at
Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, to help give
the Rangers a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series.  The Rangers struck first, scoring two second-inning
runs off Tampa starter  David Price  on a run-scoring double
by  Jeff Francoeur  and  Bengie Molina ’s looping single to
right.  Nelson Cruz  hit a home run to center field in the
third inning, Molina added another run batted in with a
fourth-inning solo home run to left and  Vladimir Guerrero 
added a run-scoring double in the fifth inning for Texas.  Lee gave up three hits and also had three strikeouts
in the first inning. He allowed a double to  Ben Zobrist  to
open the second inning before retiring the next 12 batters.  Zobrist’s seventh-inning homer was the only run Lee
surrendered. He threw 104 pitches over seven innings,
allowing five hits without a walk.  Price lasted 6 2/3 innings, giving up four earned runs
on nine hits while striking out eight.  The Rangers’  Neftali Feliz  walked his first two
batters in the ninth inning before retiring the next three
to close out the game.  The Phillies host the Cincinnati Reds and the New York
Yankees play at the Minnesota Twins in other series openers
today, and the host San Francisco Giants and Atlanta Braves
begin their matchup tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
