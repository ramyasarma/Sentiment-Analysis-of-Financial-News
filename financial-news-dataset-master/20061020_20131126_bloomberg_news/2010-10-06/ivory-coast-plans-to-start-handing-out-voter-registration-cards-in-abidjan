Ivory Coast will begin distributing
identity and voter cards today in Abidjan, the commercial
capital, ahead of a presidential election scheduled for Oct. 31,
said Yacouba Bamba, a spokesman for the electoral commission.  The cards will be handed out at enrolment centers in nine
of the city’s districts in a process that is expected to take at
least four days, Bamba told reporters. The remaining four
districts will receive theirs later, he said.  Distribution will begin in the rest of the country “once
the equipment arrives,” he said.  The voters’ roll has been a key issue preventing Ivorian
parties from agreeing to go ahead with elections, which have
been postponed seven times since President  Laurent Gbagbo’s 
mandate expired in 2005. The West African nation has been split
into a government-held south and a rebel-controlled north since
a 2002 armed uprising.  Ivory Coast  is the world’s biggest cocoa producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
