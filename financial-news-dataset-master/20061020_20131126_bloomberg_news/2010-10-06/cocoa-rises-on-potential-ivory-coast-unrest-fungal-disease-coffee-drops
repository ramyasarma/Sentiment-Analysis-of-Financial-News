Cocoa futures rose the most in a week
on concern that political unrest will disrupt supplies from
Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer. Sugar and coffee
prices declined.  Elections scheduled for Oct. 31 in Ivory Coast have been
delayed seven times since 2005. The nation has been split into a
government-held south and rebel-controlled north since a 2002
armed uprising. Cocoa has declined 17 percent this year amid
signs of rising output.  “History has shown that there is a danger of violence, and
you have to put a risk premium on that,” said  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “There’s that and
potential diseases. There’s a lot of black pod and a lot of
fungus involved because of the rainy weather.”  Cocoa for December delivery climbed $30, or 1.1 percent, to
settle at $2,744 a metric ton at 11:55 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. The price dropped 5.3 percent in the previous four
sessions.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery rose 20
pounds, or 1.1 percent, to 1,848 pounds ($2,937) a ton on NYSE
Liffe, the first rise in a week.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.2 cent, or 0.8
percent, to settle at 23.54 cents a pound in New York. In
London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery gained $2,
or 0.3 percent, to $625.60 a ton. Earlier, prices had fallen as
much as 1.1 percent  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 1.45
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $1.7555 a pound in New York. Robusta-
coffee futures for November delivery fell $13, or 0.8 percent,
to $1,627 a ton in London.  Coffee and sugar may drop in the next few months, Morgan
Stanley said.  “We anticipate weakness in the coming months as depleted
inventories are replenished,” the bank said in a report. “With
inventories tight, prices may remain elevated until further
clarity is established on looming harvests.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
