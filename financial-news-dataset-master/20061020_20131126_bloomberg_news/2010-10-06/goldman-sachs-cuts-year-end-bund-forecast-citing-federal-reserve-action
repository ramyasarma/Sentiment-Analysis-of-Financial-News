Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
 Francesco Garzarelli  and  Mike Vaknin  lowered their year-end
forecast for the yield on the 10-year German bund to 2.40
percent from 2.70 percent, according to an e-mailed note today.  The analysts cut their forecasts for Europe’s benchmark
government debt security through June, because action by the
U.S. Federal Reserve to boost the economy will crimp interest
rates, according to the note. They retained their estimate for
the end of next year at 3.30 percent.  The  bund yield  fell 7 basis points to 2.22 percent as of
4:32 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
