Canadian business and government
spending unexpectedly accelerated in September, reaching its
highest level since 2006, the Ivey purchasing managers’ index
 showed .  The  index  rose to 70.3 in September from 65.9 the month
before, according to the survey of 175 purchasing managers by
the Richard Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario. Figures
higher than 50 indicate purchasing increased. Economists
 expected  a reading of 62, based on the median of 11 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ivey report also showed prices increased at a faster
pace in September, with that sub-index rising to 61.3 from 60.8
in August. The inventory gauge rose to 58.5 from 55.3 in August,
signaling stockpiles are rising.  The employment gauge rose to 54.8 from 51.6, while the
supplier-deliveries measure fell to 44.4 from 47.5 in August,
with readings under 50 signaling that orders took more time to
fill.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Ivey index fell to 64.9
in September from 67 in August,  Jonathan Basile , an economist
with Credit Suisse in New York, said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
