Twenty years after the reunification
of Germany, it’s easier to find a job in the former communist
east than in California.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the unemployment rate in the
six eastern German states with California and Germany as a
whole. It shows the eastern rate dropped in September to the
lowest since unification on Oct. 3, 1990, as car manufacturers
and computer-chip plants replaced state-run industries and
cooperative farms. While higher than Germany and in the U.S.
overall, the rate in the east now beats California, where
workers are being shed amid a housing bust and budget crisis.  “Former communist eastern Germany is outpacing the Golden
State,”  Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group NV in
Brussels, said in an interview. “And there’s a fair chance this
development will continue. It illustrates the flexibility of the
German labor market.”  German state subsidies and a skilled workforce have drawn
companies such as Volkswagen AG and chipmaker Globalfoundries
Inc. to the east, creating jobs where factories were closed or
taken over after 1990. Back then, unemployment tripled within 15
months, reaching a post-World War II peak of 19.4 percent in
March 2005. California’s rate that same month was 5.6 percent.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  -- With assistance from  Alex Tanzi  in Washington. Editors:  Leon Mangasarian ,  Sheldon Reback .  To contact the reporters on this story:
