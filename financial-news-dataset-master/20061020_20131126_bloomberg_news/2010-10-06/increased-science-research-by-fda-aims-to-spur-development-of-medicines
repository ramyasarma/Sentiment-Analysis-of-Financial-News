The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
will create a network of academic regulatory science centers to
spur development of medical products and improve the agency’s
ability to regulate them.  New scientific tools may lead to safer painkillers, more
generic drugs, less tobacco use by children, more flexible
reviews of medical products and quicker identification of risks,
according to an FDA  report  released today. The agency’s $4
billion budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 includes
$25 million for pilot studies in partnership with researchers,
industry, and government agencies.  Outside advisers on the FDA’s Science Board raised concerns
in 2007 that the agency’s inability to keep up with scientific
advances was endangering American lives. FDA Commissioner
 Margaret Hamburg  has pushed to strengthen science research since
joining the agency in May 2009.  “There is no single discovery -- no magic bullet -- to
address our unique set of modern scientific regulatory
challenges,” the agency wrote. “But one thing is clear: if we
are to solve the most-pressing public health problems we face
today, we need new approaches, new collaborations and new ways
to take advantage of 21st century technologies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
