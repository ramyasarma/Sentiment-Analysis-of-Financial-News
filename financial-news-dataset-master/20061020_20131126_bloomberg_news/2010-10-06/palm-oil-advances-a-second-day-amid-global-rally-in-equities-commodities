Palm oil climbed for a second day,
mirroring a global stocks and commodities rally, on optimism
that demand for the vegetable oil may increase as central banks
take steps to spur economic growth and boost liquidity.  December-delivery futures rose 0.9 percent to 2,730 ringgit
($883) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. Prices
advanced 1.5 percent yesterday, the most in 11 days.  Equity markets rallied around globally after the Bank of
Japan unexpectedly cut interest rates yesterday and pledged to
buy as much as $60 billion of assets to keep the economy from
faltering, sparking speculation other central banks would follow
suit. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  hit a 26-month high on hopes
similar moves would support the global economic recovery.  “People are more upbeat about the outlook for the economic
growth as central banks are lowering rates and easing
liquidity,” said  Ivy Ng , an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.
“When the growth outlook is good every asset class tends to do
well, including commodities.” Sustained demand would keep palm
oil stockpiles from rising, she added.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to a record $1,349.80
an ounce.  Silver  extended gains to as high as $23.0763 an ounce,
the highest price since 1980, and tin, the best performer on the
London Metal Exchange this year, reached a record $26,790 a
metric ton.  The dollar index  fell to 77.628 after losing 0.9
percent yesterday. A weaker U.S. currency lifts the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  ‘Less Bearish’  “Palm oil exports have been quite strong last month and
people are less bearish about stockpiles now,” CIMB’s Ng said.  Shipments of Malaysian palm oil in September climbed 30
percent from August to 1.5 million tons, according to cargo
surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance. Rival Intertek put
the gain at 21 percent.  Malaysian  stockpiles  advanced 23 percent to 1.72 million
tons in August from July, ending seven months of losses, the
nation’s palm oil board said Sept. 15. Stockpiles may be around
1.73 million tons at the end of September, Ng said.  November-delivery soybeans in Chicago rose as much as 0.3
percent to $10.7525 a bushel, while December-delivery soybean
oil jumped as much as 0.6 percent to 44.07 cents a pound in Asia.
Soybean and palm oils are direct substitutes.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, climbed as much as 1.1 percent to
$881.50 a ton. The Dalian Commodity Exchange is closed to mark
China’s National Day celebrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
