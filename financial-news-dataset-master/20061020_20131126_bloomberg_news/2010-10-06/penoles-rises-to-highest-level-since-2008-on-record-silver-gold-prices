Industrias Penoles SAB , Mexico’s
largest silver producer, climbed to the highest level in 29
months as silver gained to a 30-year high.  Penoles gained 3.5 percent to 328 pesos at 1:14 p.m. New
York time, the biggest intra-day jump since Aug. 2. Earlier,
shares climbed as much as 4 percent to the highest level since
April 2008.  Silver gained to a 30-year high and gold rose to another
historic record on bets that precious metals are safer than
currencies. The dollar fell to the lowest level since January
against a basket of major currencies.  “In the case of Penoles, silver and gold represent a very
important part of sales,” said  Rodrigo Heredia , an analyst at
Ixe Grupo Financiero in Mexico City. “Better prices for these
metals lead to better quarterly results.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to
$23.04 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached $23.09,
the highest level since Sept. 26, 1980.  The  IPC index  climbed 0.2 percent to 34,324.52.  On Sept. 1, Penoles sold $400 million of 10-year fixed-rate
bonds to yield 5.15 percent and $130 million worth of five-year
floating-rate bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
