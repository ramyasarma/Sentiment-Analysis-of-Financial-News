Comvita Ltd. , a New Zealand supplier
of health remedies made from honey, fell the most in more than
two months in Wellington trading after posting a first-half loss,
including one-off tax and legal costs.  The company reported a loss of about NZ$2.2 million ($1.6
million) in the six months ended Sept. 30 from a NZ$1.6 million
profit a year earlier, it said in a statement today, citing
preliminary figures. Comvita shares fell 5.5 percent, the
biggest decline since Aug. 3.  First-half sales fell 9.9 percent to NZ$36.5 million from a
year earlier when the Te Puke-based company sold surplus
inventory, it said. Excluding items, profit after tax was about
NZ$100,000, it said.  Second-half operating profit is expected to be similar to
the year earlier, it said. Comvita  shares  dropped 11 cents to
NZ$1.90 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington. Earlier the stock
fell as low as NZ$1.85.  To contact the reporter for this story:
