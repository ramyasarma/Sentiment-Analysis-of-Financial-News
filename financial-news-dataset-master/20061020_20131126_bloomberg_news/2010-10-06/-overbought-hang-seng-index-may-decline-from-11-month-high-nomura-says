Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is
looking “overbought” and may decline after climbing to an 11-
month high, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The 45-member gauge rose 1.1 percent to 22,880.41 yesterday,
having rallied 21 percent from its low for the year on May 25.
It may fall toward 22,670, close to its intraday peak in January,
if it fails to rise above 23,000, according to  Tacky Cheng , a
technical analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong.  “The Hang Seng Index looks overbought following the
recent rally,” Cheng said. The measure’s 14-day  relative
strength index  has stayed above 70 since Sept. 29, a level
considered by analysts as a “sell” signal.  The Hang Seng surged 8.9 percent last month as government
and industry reports from the U.S. and China fueled confidence
in the global economic recovery. That’s the biggest monthly
increase since July 2009.  The gauge hasn’t closed above 23,000 since July 2008, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The index rose to near that level in
November 2009 before tumbling 17 percent to its 2010 low in May.  Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. Such
analysts use trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
