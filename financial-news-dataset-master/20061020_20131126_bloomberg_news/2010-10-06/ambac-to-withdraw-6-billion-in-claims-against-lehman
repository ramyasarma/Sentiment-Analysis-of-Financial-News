Ambac Financial Group Inc.  will
withdraw more than $6 billion in claims against bankrupt  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  over derivatives transactions.  The agreement was approved today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan.  The claims, filed in September 2009, were based on Lehman’s
“purported breach of obligations” related to residential
mortgage-backed securities deals with Ambac, Lehman said in an
Oct. 5 filing. Under terms of the settlement, Lehman would will
release the insurer from demands for unspecified payments and
from liabilities under derivatives transactions insured by
Ambac, New York-based Lehman said.  Ambac, the second-largest bond insurer before the onset of
the credit crisis, started “rehabilitation proceedings” in
March in a Wisconsin court that bar Lehman from suing the
company over the claims or insured derivatives deals, according
to the filing.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
