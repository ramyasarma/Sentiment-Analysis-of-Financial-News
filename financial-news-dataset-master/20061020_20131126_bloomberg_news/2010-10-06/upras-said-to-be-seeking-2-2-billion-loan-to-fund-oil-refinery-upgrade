Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS , Turkey’s sole oil refiner, is seeking about $2.2 billion of
loans to pay for an upgrade, according to two bankers familiar
with the situation.  Tupras will borrow in export credit agency-covered and
commercial portions, said the bankers, who refused to be
identified because the loan talks are private.  The Izmit, Turkey-based company, owned by Turkey’s largest
industrial group  Koc Holding AS , is cutting production of high-
sulphur fuels in response to new environmental standards and
meet increasing demand for cleaner fuels. The new converter will
produce 2.55 million tons of diesel, 772,000 tons of gasoline
and 203,000 tons of liquefied petroleum gas a year.  “These loan talks are being carried out to finance the
residuum upgrade project that we announced before,” the company
said in a statement.  Tupras hired  Tecnicas Reunidas SA  last year for the project
that will earn the refiner an annual $400 million in earnings
before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation, or Ebitda.  Tupras shares closed the morning session 0.7 percent lower
at 37.75 kurus on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.  Tupras last accessed the loan market in 2004, when it
signed a $170 million project-finance facility with BNP Paribas
SA and HSBC Holdings Plc, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That deal matures in 2015, Bloomberg data show.  Turkish companies have signed $19.4 billion of loans this
year, compared with $6.7 billion in the same period of 2009,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
