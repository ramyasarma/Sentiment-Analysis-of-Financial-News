Australia’s dollar surged to a record
against the dollar after a report showed employers added the
most jobs in eight months, adding to pressure for the central
bank to raise interest rates.  The Aussie, as the currency is nicknamed, has increased 7.5
percent during the past month versus the greenback as
speculation intensified the Federal Reserve will join the  Bank
of Japan  in expanding stimulus programs, keeping interest rates
low. That compares with Australia where the employment data
fueled bets the nation’s central bank will raise borrowing costs
next month.  “Australia is lucky in the fact that economic fundamentals
actually support the currency at these levels,” said  Annette Beacher , senior strategist at Toronto-Domminion Bank’s TD
Securities unit in Singapore. “I’m hedging my bet, saying
parity in the fourth quarter, which could be in 10 minutes or in
two months.”  Australia’s currency rose to 97.88 U.S. cents at 12:35 p.m.
in New York, from 97.75 yesterday. It earlier touched 99.18, the
strongest against the dollar since exchange controls were ended
in 1983. The Aussie fell to 80.75 yen from 81.07 yen.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, fetched 74.74
U.S. cents, from 75.25 cents yesterday. It reached 75.92, the
strongest level since Oct. 23, 2009. The currency was at 61.62
yen from 62.40 yen yesterday.  Previous Record  The Australian dollar reached its previous record of 98.50
U.S. cents in July 2008. It fell to 60.09 cents three months
later as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze
credit markets and prompted investors to dump riskier assets.  There is a 66 percent  probability  the Reserve Bank of
Australia will raise borrowing costs on Nov. 2, according to
swap indexes by Credit Suisse Group AG. The probability was 41
percent yesterday.  Australia’s employers added 49,500 workers and the
unemployment rate held at 5.1 percent in September, the
government reported today. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had forecast jobs would rise by 20,000.  The Aussie passed the Swiss franc to become the world’s
fifth most-traded currency, according to the Bank for
International Settlements’ Triennial Central Bank Survey
released Sept. 1. It accounts for 7.6 percent of daily  trading 
though Australia makes up 1.6 percent of world gross domestic
product.  To contact the reporters on this story:
