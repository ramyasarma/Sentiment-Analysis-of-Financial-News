Memc Electronic Materials Inc., which
makes silicon wafers used in the technology and solar
industries, is “cheap” and may be poised to rise by the fourth
quarter, Jim Cramer said on his “Mad Money” program.  The stock has “bottomed” since reporting its fifth-
quarterly loss in July, Cramer said. The stock has “been left
for dead,” he said.  Insider buying of the stock by managers is a good sign,
Cramer said. The former hedge-fund manager, citing a report,
said earnings estimates for the company may be too low. Also,
the company has been bringing wafer manufacturing in-house,
saving the company money, Cramer said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
