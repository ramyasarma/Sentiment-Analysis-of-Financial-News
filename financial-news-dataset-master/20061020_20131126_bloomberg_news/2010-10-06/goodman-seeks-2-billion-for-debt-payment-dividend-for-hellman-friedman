Goodman Global Inc. , the maker of
Amana air conditioners, is seeking more than $2 billion of
loans to repay debt and fund a dividend to its owner Hellman &
Friedman LLC, according to four people familiar with the matter.  The private-equity owners will extract a $366 million
payout with the transaction, Moody’s Investors Service said
today in a report. Goodman has paid $776 million in dividends
over the last year, New York-based analysts  Paul Aran  and
 Michael Mulvaney  said in the report.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is arranging a $1.4 billion first-lien
loan, a $375 million second-lien loan and a $250 million
revolving credit line, said the people familiar with the
negotiations, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The bank will host a lender meeting tomorrow at 10
a.m. in New York.  Goodman said in a regulatory filing today that it’s in
discussion with lenders for new secured credit facilities. The
Houston-based company said it will use the proceeds to repay
“substantially all” outstanding debt and fund a dividend.  The first-lien loan may have an interest rate 4.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
one of the people familiar with the talks said. Libor, the rate
banks charge to lend to each other, would have a 1.75 percent
floor, the person said.  Goodman’s second-lien loan might have a margin of 10
percentage points over the lending benchmark, the person said.  $2.6 Billion LBO  Mark Klein, an outside spokesman for Goodman, couldn’t
immediately comment on the transaction.  Hellman & Friedman, a private-equity firm with offices in
New York, London and San Francisco, took Goodman private with a
$2.6 billion leveraged buyout that was completed in February
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Private-equity firms pool money from investors and obtain
debt to finance takeovers with the intention of selling the
companies later for a profit.  Goodman’s existing $800 million term loan due February 2014
has $746.9 million outstanding with an interest rate 3
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to Goodman’s second-quarter report. Libor, the rate
banks charge to lend to each other, has a 3.25 percent floor.  Loan Price Drop  The debt dropped to 100.188 cents on the dollar today from
101.125 cents yesterday, two of the people said. Goodman will
repay the loan at par, they said.  Goodman also has a $300 million revolver expiring February
2013. The company said it had no borrowings outstanding under
the credit line as of June 30. The interest rate on borrowings
is 1 percentage point more than Libor, with a 3.25 percent
floor, the second-quarter report shows.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  At the end of June, the company owed $424 million on its
13.5 percent senior subordinated notes maturing February 2016.  Goodman is  rated  B1 by Moody’s and B+ by Standard & Poor’s;
both are four levels below investment grade.  The proposed first-lien revolver maturing 2015 and term
loan due 2016 are rated Ba3 and the second-lien term loan due
2017 got a grade of B3, Moody’s analysts Aran and Mulvaney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
