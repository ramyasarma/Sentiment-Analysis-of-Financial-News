India is considering a proposal to
ease regulations for companies borrowing abroad to fund
infrastructure projects, the Economic Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The Department of Economic Affairs, a part of the nation’s
finance ministry, is seeking to allow Indian borrowers to raise
as much as $1 billion annually to finance projects, according to
the report. The department has also proposed tax concessions on
long-term foreign-currency borrowings for infrastructure
projects, the newspaper reported, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
