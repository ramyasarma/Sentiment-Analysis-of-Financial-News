Oil rose for a third day in New York
as the dollar extended its decline against the yen and the euro,
enhancing the investment appeal of commodities, and after a U.S.
government report showed a drop in gasoline stockpiles.  Futures climbed as the U.S. currency fell to a 15-year low
against the yen and an eight-month low against the euro amid
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will expand credit easing
to sustain the economic recovery. The Energy Department said
yesterday fuel supplies slipped more than forecast by a
Bloomberg News survey.  “We’re seeing tremendous dollar weakening,” said  Hannes Loacker , an analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG in
Vienna. “That’s what we saw throughout 2009, which made oil
rise from below $40 to $70. This correlation disappeared all
year until now, so all commodities are rising.”  Oil for November delivery rose as much as 72 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $83.95 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $83.72 at 9:02 a.m. London
time. Brent crude for November settlement rose as much as 65
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $85.71 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London.  Futures reached their highest price since May 4 yesterday
after the Energy Department reported gasoline supplies fell 2.65
million barrels to 219.9 million. They were  forecast to decline 
250,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, dropped 1.12 million barrels.  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.3991 against the euro
after slipping 0.7 percent yesterday. It dropped as low as at
82.25 yen, the lowest level since May 1995. A weaker U.S.
currency bolsters the appeal of commodities as an alternative
investment to investors.  “The Federal Reserve is making it clear that they have got
the capacity to engage in monetary stimulus if needed, and the
market is viewing that as big brother stepping up to the
plate,” said  David Taylor , a market analyst at CMC Markets Ltd.
in Sydney. “That’s seeing a lower U.S. dollar and encouraging
investment into commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
