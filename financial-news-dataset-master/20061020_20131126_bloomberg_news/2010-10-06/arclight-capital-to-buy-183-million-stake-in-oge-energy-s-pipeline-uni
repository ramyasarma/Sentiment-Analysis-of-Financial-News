OGE Energy Corp. , the owner of
Oklahoma City’s electric and natural-gas utility, said private-
equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC will pay $183 million
for a 9.9 percent stake in its Enogex gas-pipeline and
processing unit to help fund expansion.  The agreement allows ArcLight, with offices in Boston,
London and New York, to expand its interest in the future,
Oklahoma City-based OGE said today in a statement. OGE will
include its energy-marketing unit, OGE Energy, with Enogex. The
deal is expected to close by Nov. 1.  Enogex is building a $124 million gas-processing plant,
extending pipelines and adding shipping capacity to handle
rising output from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, OGE
Chief Executive Officer  Peter Delaney  said on an Aug. 5 earnings
call. Planned spending through 2011 at the unit rose by $140
million in the second quarter, he said. The unit’s net income
rose 39 percent to $22.3 million from the year-earlier quarter.  Basins including the Cana field in Canadian County,
Oklahoma, and the Granite Wash formation in Texas and Oklahoma
produce natural-gas rich in liquids such as ethane and propane,
which sell at a premium to dry gas after they are extracted by
processors such as Enogex.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. OGE rose 77 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $41.27
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for an
increase of 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
