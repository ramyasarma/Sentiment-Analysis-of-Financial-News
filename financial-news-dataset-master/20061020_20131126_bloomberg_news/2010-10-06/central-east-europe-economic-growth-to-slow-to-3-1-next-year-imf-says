The economies of central and eastern
Europe will grow 3.1 percent next year, 0.3 percentage points
less than previously forecast, the International Monetary Fund
said today in its World Economic Outlook.  The 2011 forecast compares with a 3.7 percent estimate for
this year, 0.5 percentage points faster than the IMF forecast in
July.  “Economies that were hit particularly hard by the crisis
are struggling to return to sustained growth, including in many
parts of emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States, where the recovery remains much more subdued,” the
Washington-based lender said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
