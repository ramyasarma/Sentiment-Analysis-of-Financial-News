Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the largest
Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America, was raised to “buy” from
“hold” at Banco Santander SA, which said the company should
benefit from a recovery in Mexico in 2011 and a “solid”
performance in Brazil.  The brokerage has a 2011 estimate of $100 for the company’s
American depository receipts, according to a report by analysts
led by Luis Miranda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
