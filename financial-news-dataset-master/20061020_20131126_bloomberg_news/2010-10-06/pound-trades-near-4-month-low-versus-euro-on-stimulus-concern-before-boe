The pound traded near a four-month
low against the euro before the Bank of England meets to
consider whether to restart bond purchases.  Central bank officials are due to consider further stimulus
tomorrow as the Monetary Policy Committee convenes to assess
interest rates. Policy maker  Adam Posen  last week advocated
further asset purchases, or quantitative easing, saying monetary
policy “should continue to be aggressive about promoting
recovery.” He has since been backed by the British Chambers of
Commerce and the Institute of Directors.  “Sterling has been left in a pretty poor place, as the
debate in the U.K. is focused on more quantitative easing,”
said  Steve Barrow , London-based head of Group of 10 foreign-
exchange research at Standard Bank. “The market is not going to
respond well to that, and the euro is going to stay pretty
firm.”  The pound was little changed at 87.10 pence per euro at
9:55 a.m. in London. It reached 87.38 on Oct. 4, the weakest
since May 21. Sterling was also little changed against the
dollar at $1.5898 and was 0.1 percent weaker at 132.09 yen.  U.K. government bonds rose, with the yield on the 10-year
gilt falling 3 basis points to 2.94 percent and two-year yields
falling 2 basis points to 0.64 percent.  Gilts have gained 9.7 percent since the end of 2009,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit. German government bonds earned 9.2 percent, while
U.S. Treasuries returned 9.1 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
