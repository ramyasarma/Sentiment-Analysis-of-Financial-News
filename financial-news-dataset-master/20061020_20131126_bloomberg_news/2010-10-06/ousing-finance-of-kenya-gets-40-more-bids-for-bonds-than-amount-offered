Housing Finance Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, said it received bids for 40
percent more bonds than the 5 billion shillings ($62 million)
offered in a sale last month.  The company received requests for 7 billion shillings of
the seven-year securities, Managing Director  Frank Ireri  told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. The company will use
the proceeds to supply mortgages, it said on Aug. 31.  “The positive market reception to the bond clearly
demonstrates increased local investor confidence in the long-
term value proposition of Housing Finance,” Ireri said.  Urban areas in Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy, need
150,000 housing units a year, compared with the 35,000 currently
available, resulting in overcrowding and informal settlements,
according to Housing Finance.  The bonds, which will trade on  Nairobi Stock Exchange , have
a fixed interest rate of 8.5 percent. In August the company
received regulatory approval for a 10 billion-shilling bond,
with last month’s sale being the first portion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
