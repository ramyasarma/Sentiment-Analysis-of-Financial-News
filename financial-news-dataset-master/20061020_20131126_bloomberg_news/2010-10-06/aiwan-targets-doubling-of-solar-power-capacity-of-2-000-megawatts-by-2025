Taiwan’s government is doubling its
installed solar power capacity to 2,000 megawatts by 2025, from
an earlier target of 1,000 megawatts, as the Renewable Energy
Development Act boosts demand, the Bureau of Energy said in a
statement on its website today.  The government is targeting installation of 70 megawatts of
solar panels next year, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
