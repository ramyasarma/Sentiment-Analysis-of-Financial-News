South Africa needs to continue to
attract capital inflows, while shifting “their composition
towards foreign direct investment,” the World Bank’s Africa
economist, Shanti Devarajan, said.  Rising private capital flows and commodity prices are
fueling gains in the rand, Devarajan said in a video conference
from Washington today. These flows are “volatile” and
“difficult to manage,” he said.  A “currency war” as a result of countries intervening to
curb gains in their currencies may hurt growth in Africa if it
results in another global recession, Devarajan said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
