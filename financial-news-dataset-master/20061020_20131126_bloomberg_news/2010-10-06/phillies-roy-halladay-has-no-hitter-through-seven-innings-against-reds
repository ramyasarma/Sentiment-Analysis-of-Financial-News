Roy Halladay has a no-hitter through
seven innings as the Philadelphia Phillies lead the Cincinnati
Reds 4-0 in the opening game of their Major League Baseball
playoff series.  It’s the first postseason appearance for Halladay, who was
acquired by the Phillies during the offseason.   Don Larsen is the only pitcher to throw a no-hitter during
the playoffs, with a perfect game for the New York Yankees in
the 1956 World Series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
