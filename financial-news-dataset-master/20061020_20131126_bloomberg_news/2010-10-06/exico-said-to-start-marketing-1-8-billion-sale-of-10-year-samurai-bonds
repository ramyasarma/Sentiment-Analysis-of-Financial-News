Mexico started marketing a sale of
10-year Samurai bonds, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the transaction.  The government told investors the bonds may be priced to
yield between 50 basis points and 65 basis points more than the
yen swap rate, said the person, asking not to be identified as
the information is private. The notes, backed by the Japan Bank
for International Cooperation, will be priced as early as Oct.
20, the person said.  The Latin American nation wants to raise about 150 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) and hired Nomura Securities Co., Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. to
manage the sale,  Octavio Lara , deputy director of debt issuance
for Mexico’s finance ministry, said Sept. 14.  Mexico last sold debt in Japan in December, when it raised
150 billion yen in 10-year, 2.22 percent notes priced to yield
an 80-basis-point spread, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan
by overseas borrowers. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
