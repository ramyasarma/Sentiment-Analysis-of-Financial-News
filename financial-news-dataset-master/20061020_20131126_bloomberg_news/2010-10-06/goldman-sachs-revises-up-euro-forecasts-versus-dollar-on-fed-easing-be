Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised its
forecasts for the euro against the dollar on the expectation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will step up asset purchases at
its November interest-rates meeting.  The euro will trade at $1.40 in three months, $1.50 in six
months and $1.55 in 12 months,  Dominic Wilson , a senior global
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York wrote in a research
report today. The bank did not say what its previous forecasts
were.  “The market has responded to the expectation of QE2 in a
way that is broadly consistent with our work on the first round
of QE, sending bond yields lower, equities higher and the USD
weaker,” Wilson wrote, referring to so-called quantitative
easing. “The move in the dollar has been particularly striking
and relevant for the broader global picture. While our last FX
monthly laid out our long-standing view of dollar weakness,
things have unfolded more rapidly than our original forecasts
anticipated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
