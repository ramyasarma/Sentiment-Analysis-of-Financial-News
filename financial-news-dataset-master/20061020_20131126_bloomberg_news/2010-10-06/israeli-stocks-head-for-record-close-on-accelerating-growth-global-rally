Israel’s TA-25 Index headed for a
record close as the country’s economic growth accelerates and
global markets rallied on bets central banks will follow Japan
in announcing measures to boost expansion.  The  benchmark gauge  rose 0.2 percent to 1,239.63 at 2:03
p.m. in Tel Aviv, surpassing the  previous record close  of
1,237.85 on April 6. The intraday high for the benchmark stock
index was set in November 2007, at 1,248.8.  Avner Oil
Exploration LP  and  Delek Drilling LP  jumped to the highest level
since at least February 1996, when Bloomberg began tracking the
shares.  “The sharp global rally in stocks is leading to an
increase in the Israeli market,”  Yaron Fridman , equity
strategist at Bank Hapoalim Ltd. told Bloomberg by telephone.
“That together with the support of a strong local economy is
pushing investors into local stocks.” Investment alternatives
are limited as the risk of rising interest rates lessens the
appetite for bonds, he said.  Global stocks climbed with the  MSCI World Index  increasing
0.6 percent, extending yesterday’s 2 percent gain. The Bank of
Japan unexpectedly cut interest rates Oct. 5 and said it would
buy as much as $60 billion of assets to keep the economy from
faltering, increasing speculation that other central banks will
take similar steps. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped to the
highest in two years.  The Bank of Israel on Sept. 27 raised its 2010 growth
forecast to 4 percent from 3.7 percent. It expects a 3.8 percent
expansion next year. The economy has bounced back from the
global crisis faster than many developed countries with  growth 
of 0.7 percent in 2009. That compares with a 2.4 percent
 contraction  in the U.S.  Rising Rates  The central bank has increased its benchmark interest rate
1.5 percentage points to 2 percent from a record low. The bank,
headed by Governor  Stanley Fischer , forecasts a gradual increase
in the benchmark rate to 2.7 percent over the next year, it said
Sept. 27.  Energy shares, which have driven the gauge of Israel’s 25
largest companies to more than double from a 2008 low, led
today’s gains. Avner increased 1.4 percent, Delek climbed 1.7
percent and Isramco Negev 2 LP advanced 1.9 percent.  Oil and gas stocks have soared as the country made its
largest discoveries of natural gas. Delek and Avner are partners
in the Tamar and Leviathan finds in the Mediterranean Sea off
Israel’s coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
