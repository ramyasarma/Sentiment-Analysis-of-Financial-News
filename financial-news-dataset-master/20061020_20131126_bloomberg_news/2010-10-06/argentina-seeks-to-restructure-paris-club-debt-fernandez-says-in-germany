Argentina wants to restructure its
defaulted debt with the  Paris Club  group of creditor nations,
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said.  “The idea is to make a broader restructuring of debt,”
Fernandez told reporters today in Berlin after meeting German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel . “Argentina has always been willing to
pay its debts.”  Argentina owes the Paris Club, an informal association of
creditors that includes the U.S., Germany and Japan, about $6.7
billion in defaulted debt. In June, the government of South
America’s second-biggest economy restructured $12.2 billion in
bonds that were held out from a 2005 exchange. The country
defaulted on $95 billion in bonds in late 2001.  Settling with the Paris Club will give foreign companies
access to government credit to finance investments in Argentina,
Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said in an April 14 interview.
Boudou said resolving the Paris Club debts would be the country’s
next step after the June exchange.  Fernandez said any accord with the Paris Club should
include a discussion about the investments that European
companies make in Argentina and the fiscal benefits and loans
that they get from the country. Foreign Minister  Hector Timerman 
said July 30 that the country wants an accord with the club
without oversight from the International Monetary Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
