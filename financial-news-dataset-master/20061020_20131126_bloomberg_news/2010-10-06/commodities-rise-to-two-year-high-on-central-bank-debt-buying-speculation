Commodities rose to the highest in
almost two years on speculation central banks around the world
will join the Bank of Japan in increasing purchases of
government debt to boost economic recovery.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 0.6 percent to 559.976, the highest level since Oct.
7, 2008, before paring gains. The  UBS Bloomberg Constant
Maturity Commodity Index  climbed to 1,442.24, the highest since
Aug. 29, 2008.  Gold futures rose to a record, topping at $1,351 an ounce,
and silver futures extended a rally to a 30-year high. Wheat
also gained and corn and soybeans were little changed after
paring gains. Crude oil also was little changed after earlier
gaining as much as 0.6 percent to the highest price since May 4.  “Gold will just keep running with the Japanese coming out
with quantitative easing, and there is a lot of discussion about
when the U.S. will come in,”  Ashok Shah , chief investment
officer at asset manager London & Capital said today by phone.
“Gold and precious metals will continue to benefit because
there is more quantitative easing down the line.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose $5.70, or 0.4 percent, to
$1,346.35 an ounce at 11:23 a.m. in London. Futures for December
delivery climbed $6.70, or 0.5 percent, to $1,347 an ounce. The
most-active contract has gained 23 percent this year.  Silver for immediate delivery jumped as much as 1 percent
to $23.0763 an ounce, the highest since Sept. 24, 1980. Platinum
climbed to $1,707.50 an ounce, the most since May 17, and
palladium rose to $593.25 an ounce, the highest since March 4,
2008.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 3.25 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $6.6675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Corn gained 0.25 cent to $4.9125. Soybeans for November delivery
were unchanged at $10.7175 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
