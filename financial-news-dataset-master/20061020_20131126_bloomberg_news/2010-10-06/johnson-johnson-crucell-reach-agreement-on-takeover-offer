Johnson & Johnson  and Crucell NV
reached an agreement on the U.S. drugmaker’s planned 1.75
billion-euro ($2.4 billion) acquisition of the Dutch vaccine
manufacturer.  J&J will buy the rest of Leiden, Netherlands-based Crucell
it doesn’t already own for 24.75 euros a share in cash, the
companies said today in a joint statement. The companies said
Sept. 17 they were in talks for a deal at that price.  The acquisition would be the biggest for J&J, the world’s
largest health products company, since its 2006 purchase of
Pfizer Inc.’s consumer unit for $16.6 billion. It would give the
U.S. drugmaker access to the global vaccine market, worth $22.1
billion last year, up from $19 billion in 2008, according to
Rockville, Maryland-based research company Kalorama Information.  “Strategically, Crucell provides a cost-effective vaccine
platform that can drive good long-term growth with limited
generic exposure,” said  Larry Biegelsen , an analyst at Wells
Fargo Securities in New York, in a report today.  Crucell rose 9 cents to close at 24.64 euros in Amsterdam
trading. The stock has risen 77 percent  this year . J&J, based in
New Brunswick, New Jersey, rose 41 cents to $63.21 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .  J&J, which already owns  18 percent  of Crucell, can legally
force shareholders to sell if the company holds more than 95
percent of Crucell’s stock, according to the statement. If it
misses this threshold, but acquires more than 80 percent, it
will use all legal measures to acquire the outstanding shares.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2011, the companies said. The acquisition will cut J&J’s
 earnings per share  by about 3 to 5 cents next year, according to
the statement. Barclays Capital advised Crucell, and Lazard BV
advised the company’s  supervisory board .  J&J bought a stake in Crucell in September 2009 for about
300 million euros, forming a partnership for flu shots and
therapies. Vaccine companies are gaining from revived interest
after last year’s influenza pandemic.  To contact the reporters on this story:
