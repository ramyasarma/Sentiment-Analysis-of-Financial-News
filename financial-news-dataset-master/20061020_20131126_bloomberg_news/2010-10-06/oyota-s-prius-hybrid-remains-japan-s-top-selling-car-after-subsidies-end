Toyota Motor Corp. ’s Prius hybrid was
the best-selling car in Japan in September even as government
subsidies for fuel-efficient models ended.  While Prius sales fell 14 percent from a year earlier to
27,249 vehicles last month, the model outsold  Daihatsu Motor
Co. ’s 18,583 deliveries of the Tanto minicar, according to
statements from the Japan Automobile Dealers Association and
Japan Mini Vehicles Association today. The Prius has been the
nation’s top-selling car since June 2009.  Industrywide car sales in Japan may plunge 23 percent in
the six months started Oct. 1 from a year earlier, after a
government subsidy for fuel-efficient cars ended Sept. 8,
according to the auto dealers group.  Toyota fell 0.6 percent to 2,958 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
