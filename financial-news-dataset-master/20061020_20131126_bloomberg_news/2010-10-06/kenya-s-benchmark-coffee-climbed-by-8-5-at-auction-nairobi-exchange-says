Kenya’s benchmark coffee grade rose
8.5 percent at auction yesterday amid lower supplies, the
Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top AA grade sold for an average of $281.71 for a 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $259.62 a fortnight
earlier, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies of the grade fell 20 percent to 3,236 bags, it said.  The average price for all coffee traded gained 5.2 percent
to $216.69 a bag as buyers replenished their stocks, the
exchange said.  “The quantity in the market is down and that’s why we’re
now holding auctions every two weeks,” said Sam Kimani, a
manager at Taylor Winch Ltd., by phone from Nairobi. “The
quality is low but demand is high because of low stocks.”  Sales at the auction jumped 80 percent to 13,131 bags worth
$3.47 million, from 7,279 bags valued at $1.82 million, the
exchange said.  Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
