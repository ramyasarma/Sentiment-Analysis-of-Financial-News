Sri Lanka’s  exports  are likely to
rise as much as 12 percent in 2010, a central bank official said,
allaying concerns growth is slowing after the island in July
reported the smallest increase in shipments this year.  Overseas sales rose for a sixth month in July, boosted by
higher tea and rubber prices. Still, shipments grew only 0.6
percent that month from a year earlier, versus 23 percent in
June, as sales of textiles and garments dropped 11 percent, data
from the  Central Bank  of  Sri Lanka  show.  “We can’t make conclusions looking at one month’s data,”
 K.D. Ranasinghe , head of the central bank’s economic research
department, said today in a telephone interview. “We see an
improvement in export volumes in the coming months, including
garment exports.”  The European Union’s decision in August to withdraw trade
privileges won’t hurt exports, which account for about 20
percent of the nation’s $42 billion economy, Ranasinghe said.
The trading block temporarily stripped the island of some
concessions, saying the South Asian country failed to respond to
pleas to improve its human rights record.  Sri Lankan exporters were making cost savings with interest
 rates  at a six-year low and inflation at less than half the
average rate of the five years through 2009, Ranasinghe said.  Sri Lankan exporters would also overcome the rupee’s rise
to a 21-month high, which was due to “macro reasons such as
inflows and international dollar weakness,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
