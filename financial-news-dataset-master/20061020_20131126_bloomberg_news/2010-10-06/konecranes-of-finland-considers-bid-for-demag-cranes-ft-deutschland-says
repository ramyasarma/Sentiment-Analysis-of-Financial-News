Konecranes Oyj  of Finland is mulling
a takeover bid for Germany’s  Demag Cranes AG , the  Financial

information.  The assessment is at an “advanced” stage, the newspaper
said in an e-mailed preview of an article to be published
tomorrow.  Konecranes has hired advisers to assist with the proposal,
and has organized financing, the newspaper said.  Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment, the
