U.K. house prices may fall further as
policy measures may not be enough to support the property
market, the International Monetary Fund said.  Home values have stayed resilient partly because of a tax
exemption on first-home purchases under 250,000 pounds
($397,000), the IMF said in a footnote of its World Economic
Outlook published today in Washington. The tax holiday,
implemented by the previous government in March for a two-year
period, is currently under review.  “What remains worrisome, however, is that house prices are
still high based on traditional valuation yardsticks,” the IMF
said. “Policy support may not be enough to prevent further
correction.”  Recent data indicate the U.K. housing market has started to
falter after partially erasing the price losses sustained during
the recession. The prospect of the deepest public spending cuts
since World War II has sparked concerns of higher  unemployment ,
threatening home values.  “A lot will depend on the path of economic recovery: if
employment creation remains low, risks of a double dip in
housing naturally increase,” the IMF said in the report,
referring to both the U.K. and U.S. property markets.  The Bank of England is tomorrow forecast to keep its
 benchmark interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of 60 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
