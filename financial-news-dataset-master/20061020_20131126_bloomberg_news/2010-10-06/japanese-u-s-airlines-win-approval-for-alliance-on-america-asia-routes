Four U.S. and Japanese carriers
including  AMR Corp. ’s American Airlines and  Japan Airlines Corp. 
won federal immunity from antitrust prosecution today for their
partnerships on U.S.-Asia routes.  The U.S. Transportation Department found that the carriers’
cooperation in two separate alliances would improve competition,
lower fares and increase schedule options, according to an
agency statement.  American and Japan Air in February requested antitrust
immunity for cooperating on pricing, routes and marketing for
overseas flights as part of their Oneworld alliance.  United Continental Holdings Inc. ’s United and Continental
units and All Nippon Airways Co. made a similar immunity request
in December for their Star Alliance. The department consolidated
the requests into a single proceeding March 31.  United and Continental, which were separate carriers when
they made the immunity request, merged Oct. 1.  The requests were made possible by a preliminary “Open
Skies” agreement between the U.S. and Japan in December that
struck down national limits on how many carriers can fly between
the two countries and what prices they can charge. Japan has
said it wouldn’t sign the agreement unless the U.S. granted
immunity for its carriers.  The Transportation Department said in its statement today
that the immunity approvals are contingent on a final “Open
Skies” treaty being signed. The agency’s order won’t become
effective until after a 21-day comment period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
