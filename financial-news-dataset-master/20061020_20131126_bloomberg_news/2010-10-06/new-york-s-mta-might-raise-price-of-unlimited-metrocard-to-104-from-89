New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority tomorrow will consider raising the cost
of monthly unlimited bus and subway fares to $104 from $89,
according to a proposal posted on the agency’s website.  The MTA, whose 8.5 million weekday riders make it the
busiest U.S. mass-transit system, also will consider raising
fares for its railroads. Long Island Rail Road commuters would
pay from 5.5 percent to 11.5 percent more; those on Metro-North
Railroad would pay from 3.8 percent to 14.3 percent more.  The increases are part of an initiative approved by the
governor and legislature last year aimed at raising revenue by
7.5 percent next year.  The agency had also considered ending passes that offer
limitless riding. “An overwhelming majority of transit
customers told us that keeping 7-Day and 30-Day passes that
provide for unlimited travel is preferred to a capped pass,” 
wrote   Jay Walder , the MTA’s chairman and chief executive
officer, in a letter to the agency’s board yesterday and posted
on its website.  The authority plans to vote on  raising  the cost of seven-
day unlimited MetroCards to $29 from $27.  The MTA’s  $12 billion budget  has suffered because a payroll
tax in New York City and seven other counties that was adopted
as part of the bailout hasn’t met projections. The state also
cut more than $140 million in MTA aid to help close its own $9.2
billion budget gap, leaving the agency with a $900 million
deficit.  Higher Fares, Fewer Workers  MTA has cut service, trimmed its workforce and reduced
overtime. It raised fares for single rides on buses and subways
to $2.25 from $2 last year.  “Despite a shortfall of this magnitude, we were able to
keep to the 7.5 percent revenue increase by undertaking the
largest and most comprehensive cost-cutting initiative in the
history of the MTA,” said Aaron Donovan, an agency spokesman.
The cuts will save the MTA $380 million this year and generate
$500 million in recurring savings starting next year, he said.  The agency also plans on considering a $1 surcharge on new
MetroCards to encourage riders to refill old ones, reduce the
bonus on pay-per-ride cards to 7 percent from 15 percent, and
increase seven-day express bus unlimited cards to $50 from $45.  The agency will vote on raising tolls on major bridges to
as much as $7 from $5.50 on Oct. 27. The one-way toll for the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn may
rise to $14 from $11 for drivers paying cash.  The increases would raise more than $400 million for the
MTA next year, Walder said in his letter to the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
