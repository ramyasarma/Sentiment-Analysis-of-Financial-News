Dartmouth College received a $9
million pledge to support its fitness center, which will be
named after the late Charles J. Zimmerman, a former chairman of
the institution’s board of trustees.  The gift, from an anonymous donor, will be used to retire
debt on Dartmouth’s 14,000-square foot fitness center, which
opened in 2006, the college in Hanover, New Hampshire, said
today in a  statement  on its website. The money will also
establish a fund to repair and replace exercise equipment.  Zimmerman graduated from Dartmouth College in 1923 and
received a business degree from its Tuck School of Business the
following year. He served as a trustee of Dartmouth’s board from
1952 to 1972, and was chair from 1970 to 1972, when the college
first admitted women. Zimmerman, who died in 1994 at age 92, was
the former president and chairman of Connecticut Mutual Life
Insurance Co., which was bought by Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co., based in Springfield, in 1996.  “At Dartmouth College we see athletics and fitness as
essential to learning,” President  Jim Yong Kim  said in the
statement. “We are grateful to the donor for underwriting a
facility that is critical to the health of our entire community
and honoring an alumnus who gave extraordinary service to his
alma mater and his profession.”  Dartmouth, founded in 1769, has about 5,800 students and is
the smallest institution in the Ivy League, a group of eight
private northeastern universities. Graduates include U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  and his immediate
predecessor,  Henry Paulson , as well as  Jeffrey Immelt , the
chairman and chief executive officer of  General Electric Co .,
based in Fairfield, Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
