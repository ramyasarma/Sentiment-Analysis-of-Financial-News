United Parcel Service Inc. , the
world’s largest package-delivery company, said it expects to
hire 50,000 seasonal holiday workers this year in the U.S., the
same as projected for last year.  The hiring typically starts this month and will bolster the
current U.S. staff of 340,000 full- and part-time workers,
 Rebecca Treacy-Lenda , a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based
company, said today in a telephone interview. Most of the new
workers are employed between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in
late November and Christmas.  UPS said the primarily part-time seasonal jobs typically
start at about $8.50 an hour, and the duties include sorting
packages and assisting drivers. Working as a seasonal hire is a
good way for people to get a foot in the door for a full-time
position at the company, Treacy-Lenda said.  FedEx Corp. , the world’s second-largest package-shipping
company, didn’t immediately have seasonal hiring projections
available. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said last month
that shipments were “solid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
