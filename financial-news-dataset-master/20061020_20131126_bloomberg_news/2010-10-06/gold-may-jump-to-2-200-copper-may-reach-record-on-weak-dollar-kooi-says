Gold prices may surge 64 percent and
copper will jump to the highest level ever as the dollar
tumbles, said Mari Kooi, the chief executive officer of Wolf
Asset Management International LLC.  The greenback may fall as much as 20 percent in the next
eight to 12 months against a basket of currencies including the
South Africa rand and the Canadian dollar, said Kooi, who
manages $1 billion and is shifting assets into raw-material
investments. The decline will send gold as high as $2,200 an
ounce, she said yesterday by telephone from London.  The metal climbed to $1,342.90 in New York yesterday, the
highest ever, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said the U.S. central bank may buy more debt to spur growth and
the dollar dropped to the lowest level since January against a
basket of six currencies. Record-low  borrowing costs  and rising
government debt helped bullion prices jump 22 percent this year.  The dollar “will fall as people perceive that the Fed will
do anything to fuel growth,” Kooi said. “Commodities are going
to be a hot thing.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $23.50, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $1,340.30 an ounce on the Comex in New
York yesterday.  Copper at Record?  Copper prices also will rise, adding as much as 10 percent
to a record $9,000 a metric ton by yearend on the London Metal
Exchange, Kooi said. Industrial metals will climb as governments
fund infrastructure projects in a bid to revive struggling
economies, she said.  “Copper is the one to watch,” Kooi said. “It’s a
concentrated market where supply can be interrupted, but at the
same time there is burgeoning demand.”  On the LME, the commodity for delivery in three months rose
1.4 percent to close at $8,176 a ton yesterday. The price
touched a record $8,940 a ton in July 2008.  “Infrastructure is the solution of weakening economic
times,” Kooi, 56, said. “We have tagged this the ‘decade of
metals.’”  To contact the reporters on the story:
