Singapore’s dollar may weaken 4.2
percent against the euro by the end of the year, Okasan
Securities Co. said, citing a technical indicator known as the
double-top formation.  The city state’s currency may decline 1.6 percent to
S$1.8421 versus the euro in one to two weeks and to S$1.8907 by
Dec. 31, said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency trader at
Okasan, citing a chart based on the Fibonacci sequence of
numbers. The Singapore dollar advanced to highs of S$1.6846
against the euro on June 7 and S$1.6970 on Sept. 10, and last
week fell below the lowest level between those highs of
S$1.7923, a bearish signal for the Asian currency.  “With the completion of the double top, the Singapore
dollar may fall to the next Fibonacci level quite quickly,”
Tokyo-based Soma said. “After breaking the initial target, the
currency may gradually weaken to reach the ultimate target
before the end of this year.”  The Singapore dollar slid 0.2 percent against the euro
today to S$1.8122 as of 8:37 a.m. local time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. The Fibonacci theory
asserts that prices tend to rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching highs or lows. The first target is a 38.2 percent
retracement of the currency’s rally in the past year, while the
second is a 50 percent return of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
