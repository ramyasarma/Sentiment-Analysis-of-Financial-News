Shipping Corp. of India , the nation’s
largest sea-cargo carrier, surged the most in more than 16
months in Mumbai trading after the government said it will sell
part of its stake in the company.  Shipping Corp.  rose 14 percent to 192.05 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. trading close, the most since May 18, 2009. Shares of the
Mumbai-based company earlier climbed as much as 21 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since May 2004.  The government said yesterday it will sell a 10 percent
stake, or about 42.3 million shares, cutting its holding and
boosting market liquidity. Shipping Corp. will issue the same
amount in new shares, raising funds to pay for a planned
doubling of capacity in five years as the nation’s demand for
coal and steel boosts shipping traffic.  “‘Investors are excited about the larger float of
shares,” said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., which manages the equivalent
of $124 million in assets.  The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of commodity-shipping
costs, “has also started looking up,” Choksey said. The index
rose 3.7 percent yesterday, its third straight session of gains.  The government’s holding will fall to 63.75 percent from
80.12 percent after the share sale.  Rivals’ Shares Gain  Shares of other Indian shipping companies also advanced
today.  Great Eastern Shipping Co.  rose 3.3 percent to 334.70
rupees,  Mercator Lines Ltd.  climbed 4.7 percent to 66.20 rupees,
and  Essar Shipping Ports & Logistics Ltd.  gained 1.7 percent to
118.65 rupees.  China Cosco Holdings Co. , Asia’s largest shipping line by
market value, climbed 6 percent to HK$9.58 at the 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong trading.  The Shipping Corp. stake sale is part of a government plan
to raise as much as 400 billion rupees ($9 billion) in the year
ending March 31 by selling shares in state-controlled companies,
including Coal India Ltd. and  Steel Authority of India Ltd.   The sale of shares in the shipping line will generate about
13 billion rupees, the government said, without specifying when
the stock will be sold. Based on Shipping Corp.’s closing price
of 168 rupees yesterday, the share sale would raise 14.2 billion
rupees.  “There is an increase in commodity prices and the demand
momentum is surfacing again,” said  K.K. Mital , who manages the
equivalent of $11.3 million in assets at New Delhi-based Globe
Capital Market Ltd. “The expectation is international trade
will go up, so demand for freight movement will go up and firm
up freight rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
