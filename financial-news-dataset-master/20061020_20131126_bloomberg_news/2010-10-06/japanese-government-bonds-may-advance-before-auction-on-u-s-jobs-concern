Japanese  bond  futures dropped the
most in almost a month after the Ministry of Finance set the
smallest coupon for 10-year debt in seven years, reducing demand
at an auction.  Ten-year yields climbed from a seven-year low after the
International Monetary Fund said Japanese banks’ holdings of
government bonds pose a risk to financial stability. The
nation’s bond market is close to a bubble,  Christian Carrillo ,
Tokyo-based head of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at Societe
Generale SA, wrote in a report.  “The coupon rate is too low to spur demand,” said
 Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan
Securities Co. “When bond yields fall to these lows, investors
have to prepare for their sudden rebound.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery fell 0.30 to
143.85 at the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest
slump since Sept. 10.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond rose two basis
points to 0.86 percent as of 3:27 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 lost 0.186 yen to 101.281.
Ten-year yields touched 0.82 percent yesterday, the least since
July 1, 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The 2.2 trillion yen ($27 billion) sale of 10-year debt
drew bids valued at 2.85 times the amount on offer, compared
with a so-called  bid -to-cover ratio of 3.16 in September. The
coupon was set at 0.8 percent, the lowest payout for 10-year
debt since June 2003.  Japanese banks’ holdings of government debt create a
potential risk to financial stability if yields jump, the IMF
said in its semiannual World Economic Outlook report. Japanese
lenders held 294 trillion yen in government debt as of December,
43 percent of the total outstanding, Finance Ministry data show.  “The latest move of JGBs below 0.85 percent cannot be
explained by fundamentals in our view,”  Carrillo  wrote in the
report. “We refuse to chase the bubble but cannot neglect the
likelihood of it continuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
