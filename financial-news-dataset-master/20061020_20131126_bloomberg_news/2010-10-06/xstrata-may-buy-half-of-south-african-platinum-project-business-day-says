Xstrata Plc will decide by the end of
the year whether to exercise an option to buy half of a platinum
project in South Africa, Business Day reported.  The miner has the option to buy 50 percent of one or more
of Nkwe Platinum Ltd.’s five properties in the east of the
country’s Bushveld Complex, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing Ben Moolman, head of Xstrata Platinum.  A recommendation on whether to take up an option will be
presented to Xstrata’s board by the end of 2010, Business Day
said, citing Moolman.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
