The Kwok family trust, which controls
Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., has agreed to pay about HK$800
million ($103 million) in land premiums to the Hong Kong
government to turn a building site in the city’s Island South
district into a luxury housing project, Ming Pao reported,
citing people it didn’t identify.  The site, located on Island Road near Deep Water Bay, has a
maximum buildable area of about 40,000 square feet, the Hong
Kong-based, Chinese-language newspaper said. The Kwok family
trust plans to build about 10 houses on the site to be sold for
a total of about HK$2.5 billion, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
