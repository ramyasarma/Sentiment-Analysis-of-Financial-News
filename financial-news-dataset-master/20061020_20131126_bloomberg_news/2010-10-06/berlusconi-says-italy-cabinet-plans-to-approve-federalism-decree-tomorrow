Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said his government will pass a decree tomorrow on
fiscal federalism, a key part of its agenda that will turn over
more power to local governments.  The federalism measure, which Berlusconi’s Northern League
ally considers vital to its support of the government, will be
phased in over seven years. It will give local authorities the
power to set some taxes and keep more of the levies paid locally
for public services, including health and law enforcement.  “We have great confidence in our cities and their ability
to take in income-tax returns from Italians,” Berlusconi told a
press conference in Rome today. The decree will require the
approval of parliament, he said, adding that federalism will not
bring extra costs to the state.  Umberto Bossi, founder of the Northern League party, has
championed the legislation. He has the support of many northern
Italians, who complain their taxes are spent to finance the
economically depressed south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
