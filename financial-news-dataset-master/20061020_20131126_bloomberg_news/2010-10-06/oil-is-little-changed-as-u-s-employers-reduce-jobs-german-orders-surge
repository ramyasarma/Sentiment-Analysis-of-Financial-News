Crude oil rose to a five-month high
as the dollar declined on speculation the Federal Reserve will
act to revive the U.S. economy by buying bonds.  Oil climbed 0.5 percent as the U.S. currency slipped to a
15-year low against the yen, bolstering the appeal of
commodities to investors. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct.
4 that restarting large-scale asset purchases would probably
spur growth. A government report showed that U.S. crude
stockpiles increased last week as fuel supplies fell.  “This dollar situation is really at a critical point, and
there’s increasing talk of it extending its move lower, which is
starting to feed directly into this crude rally,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund focusing on energy. The fuel supply drop will provide “a
fundamental narrative and support us going higher,” he said.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 41 cents to $83.23 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement price since May 3. Futures are up 17 percent from a
year ago.  Brent crude oil for November settlement climbed 22 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to end the session at $85.06 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest level
since May 4.  The Fed snapped up $300 billion of Treasuries last year. It
purchased $2.069 billion of Treasuries maturing from March 2013
to June 2013 today as part of a program to reinvest principal
payments on its mortgage holdings into government debt to
prevent money from being drained out of the financial system.
The central bank has bought $44.071 billion of Treasuries since
it began the program on Aug. 17.  Weaker Dollar  The dollar declined 0.3 percent to 82.94 yen from 83.22
yesterday. It touched 82.77, the weakest level since May 1995.
The U.S. currency fell 0.7 percent against the euro to $1.3934
after reaching an eight-month low of $1.3948 in New York.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency against
six major peers including the yen and the euro, fell 0.5 percent
to the lowest level since January.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities advanced
0.3 percent to 289.15, the highest level since January. Gold
futures for December delivery rose $7.40, or 0.6 percent, to
$1,347.70 on the Comex in New York, a record settlement.  “The market is trading on the falling dollar and
expectations of quantitative easing,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St.
Louis. “The inventory data today was mixed, a little bearish
for oil and bullish for the products, but the focus is on other
things at the moment.”  Oil Supplies  Crude oil  supplies  climbed 3.09 million barrels to 360.9
million in the week ended Oct. 1, leaving stockpiles 13 percent
higher than the five-year average for the period, the Energy
Department said. Inventories were forecast to  increase  by
413,000 barrels, according to the median of 14 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles  fell  2.65 million barrels to 219.9
million, the report showed. Supplies of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, slipped 1.12
million barrels to 172.5 million.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 3.04 cents, or 1.4
percent, to end the session at $2.1559 a gallon on the Nymex. It
was the highest settlement since Aug. 5.  “This report was supportive for the products but not for
crude,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “It looks like the drop in refinery
runs caused the drop in fuel supplies because demand for both
distillate and gasoline was down last week.”  Operating Rates  Refiners reduced  operating rates  by 2.7 percentage points
to 83.1 percent of capacity, according to the report. It was the
lowest level since the week ended March 26. Analysts estimated a
decline of 0.5 percentage point.  “November gasoline is the strongest instrument on the
board today,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “A rally in gasoline prices is
not going to translate into stronger consumer demand for
gasoline. It’s not going to help consumer demand and it’s not
going to help gasoline recover.”  Fuel consumption  dropped 6.4 percent to 18.5 million
barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 1, the biggest weekly
decline since Feb. 27, 2004, according to the department.
Gasoline demand fell 4.2 percent to 8.99 million barrels a day,
the report showed.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 730,232
contracts as of 3:20 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 872,771
contracts yesterday, 32 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.41 million contracts, the
highest level since May 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
