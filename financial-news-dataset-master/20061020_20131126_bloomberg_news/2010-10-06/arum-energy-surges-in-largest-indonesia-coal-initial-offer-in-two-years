PT Harum Energy  surged on debut after
raising 2.86 trillion rupiah ($321 million) in an initial share
sale, the biggest by a coal company in Indonesia in two years.  The stock climbed 7.7 percent to 5,600 rupiah a share in
Jakarta trading at 9:53 a.m., after gaining as much as 20
percent earlier, compared with 0.2 percent increase on the
benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index .  Harum Energy sold 550 million new and existing shares in an
initial offer, said Ferry Budiman Tanja, president director of
PT Ciptadana Securities, which helped arranged the sale. The
proceeds are the biggest after  PT Adaro Energy , the country’s
largest listed coal company by market value, raised $1.34
billion and  PT Bayan Resources  raised $528 million in 2008.  Indonesian coal producers are raising funds to ramp up
output to meet increasing domestic and overseas demand. Local
consumption may almost double to 120 million metric tons by 2015
from 64 million this year as the biggest economy in Southeast
Asia builds more power plants,  Bambang Setiawan , a director
general at the energy ministry, said May 31.  Harum Energy posted net income of 767 billion rupiah with
sales of 4.6 trillion rupiah last year, President Director  Ray Antonio Gunara  said Sept. 2. The company produced 5.8 million
tons of coal in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
