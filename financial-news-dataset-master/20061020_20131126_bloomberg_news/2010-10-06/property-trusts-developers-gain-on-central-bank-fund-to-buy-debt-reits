Japanese real estate investment
trusts and developers rose for a second day after the Bank of
Japan said it will set up a fund to buy government debt and
other assets including REITs to boost the economy.  The 36-member Tokyo Stock Exchange  REIT Index  advanced 1.2
percent to 977.17 at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The
44-member  Topix Real Estate Index  was the third best performer
among the Topix index’s 33 industry groups, rising 4.2 percent.  The Bank of Japan said yesterday it will form a 5 trillion
yen ($60 billion) fund to buy government debt, commercial paper,
exchanged traded funds and REITs. The  plan  to inject liquidity
into the market may benefit Japanese REITs which have lost two-
thirds of their value since May 2007 as the global financial
crisis unfolded.  “The Bank of Japan’s plan to support J-REITs is very
positive news,” said  Hideyuki Shinkai , a Tokyo-based fund
manager for Norinchukin Trust & Banking Co. “I expect the REIT
index to reach 1,000 points before the end of the year.”  The BOJ said yesterday the 5 trillion yen fund will buy
about 3.5 trillion yen in government debt and the remainder will
be used to purchase other assets.  Sumitomo Real Estate Sales Co., a unit of Japan’s third-
largest property developer, rose 6 percent to 3,955 yen. NTT
Urban Development Corp. surged 4.9 percent to 73,400 yen.
Leopalace21 Corp. added 7 percent to 138 yen.  Tokyu REIT Inc. advanced 1.1 percent to 455,000 yen.  Off the Peak  The REIT index lost 63 percent from its  peak  in May 2007 as
the global credit crisis made it harder for the trusts to
refinance loans and raise capital to buy properties.  The index has dropped 1.8 percent since Aug. 27, 2009, when
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
introduced a fund that would invest as much as 500 billion yen
to help J-REITs refinance their debt.  J-REITs represent about 20 percent of Japan’s 45 trillion
yen securitized real estate market, government data show. The
market, formed in September 2001, was created as a financial
tool that pools assets into tradable securities, making
investments easier and creating liquidity in the property market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
