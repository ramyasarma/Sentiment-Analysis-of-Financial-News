Japanese  stock   futures  and Australian
shares fell after a report showed U.S. companies unexpectedly
cut jobs last month and the yen strengthened to a 15-year high.  American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker, and  Honda Motor Co. , a carmaker, lost 0.6 percent
from their closing share prices in Tokyo. Both get about 80
percent of their sales abroad, and the higher yen cuts the
outlook for export earnings. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the
country’s largest lender by market value, dropped 0.8 percent.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company, gained
0.8 percent in Sydney as commodity prices increased.  “The severity of the job situation in the U.S. was
confirmed,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450
million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
The weaker dollar “will be a headwind for exporters,” while it
leads to higher commodity prices that benefit resource-related
industries, he said.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 9,670 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,700 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,660
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s  S&P/ASX
200 Index  dropped 0.3 percent today, and New Zealand’s  NZX 50
Index  retreated 0.2 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index fell 0.1 percent yesterday from a five-month
high the day before after figures from ADP Employer Services
showed companies in the U.S. cut 39,000 jobs last month.
Economists had forecast 20,000 would be added, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  World Economy  The International Monetary Fund said yesterday after Asian
markets closed that high unemployment, public debt and fragile
banking systems pose risks to global prosperity, urging policy
makers to take bolder steps to assure a sustained recovery.  The world economy will expand 4.2 percent next year, the
Washington-based IMF said, down from its forecast of 4.3 percent
three months ago. The fund projects growth of 4.8 percent this
year, up from 4.6 percent.  The yen appreciated to 82.77 against the dollar about 1 a.m.
today in Tokyo from 83.13 at the close of stock trading
yesterday. That’s the strongest level since May 1995 and exceeds
the 82.88 reached on Sept. 15, the day Japan’s government said
it intervened in the foreign-exchange market to weaken the
currency for the first time since 2004.  The yen is headed for its strongest annual average level
against the dollar since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s
close. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas earnings at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Valuations, Commodities  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has risen 8 percent this year
on speculation growth in profit will weather Europe’s debt
crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-price inflation and
concern about the pace of the U.S. economic rebound. Stocks in
the gauge trade at 14.4 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Crude oil for November delivery gained 0.5 percent
yesterday in New York, the highest settlement since May 3. The
 London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including aluminum and
copper advanced 0.6 percent yesterday to the highest since July
2008. The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for commodities
jumped 2.7 percent yesterday, rising for a fourth day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
