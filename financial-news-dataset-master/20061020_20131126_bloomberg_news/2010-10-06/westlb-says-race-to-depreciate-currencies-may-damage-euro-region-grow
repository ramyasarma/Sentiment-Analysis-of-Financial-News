The euro may strengthen, crimping
growth in the region that uses the currency, because the
European Central Bank isn’t likely to match other nations’
“expansive monetary policy measures,” WestLB AG said.  “There are concerns that a race to depreciate is about to
begin, in which the euro zone will fall behind,”  Torge Middendorf , an economist at the Dusseldorf-based bank, wrote
today in a research note. “A 10 percent appreciation of the
real effective exchange rate would result in one percentage
point less growth in the euro zone within two years. This
headwind would come at just the wrong time in particular for the
economically weaker members” of the euro area, he wrote.  The euro was little changed at $1.3855 as of 1:41 p.m. in
London, after reaching $1.3881, the strongest level since Feb.
