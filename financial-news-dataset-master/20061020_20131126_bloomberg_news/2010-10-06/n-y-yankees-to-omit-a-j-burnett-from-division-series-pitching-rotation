The New York Yankees plan to skip
 A.J. Burnett’s  spot in the rotation during their American League
division series against the Minnesota Twins.  CC Sabathia  will start Game 1 in Minnesota today, with  Andy Pettitte  and  Phil Hughes  making the following starts in the
best-of-five playoff series, Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said
yesterday at a news conference. Sabathia would then take the
mound on short rest if Game 4 is needed and Pettitte would pitch
Game 5 on regular rest.  Burnett, who signed a five-year, $82.5 million contract
with the Yankees in December 2008, went 10-15 with a 5.26 earned
run average this season, dropping seven of his last eight
decisions.  Sabathia and Pettitte are left-handers. Burnett is a
righty.  “A.J. will pitch out of the bullpen, but if we need him to
start a game, he will start a game,” Girardi said. “We felt
with all the left-handed hitters we would try to throw four
lefties at them in five games.”  Burnett went 1-1 with a 5.27 ERA in five starts during the
Yankees’ championship run last season. He allowed one run on
four hits in Game 2 of the World Series and lasted just two
innings in Game 5, allowing six earned runs in an 8-6 defeat.
The Yankees went on to claim their 27th championship in six
games.  The Yankees also said yesterday that they left pitchers
 Javier Vazquez  and  Ivan Nova  off the roster for their first-
round playoff series against the Twins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
