The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  proposed increasing protection for bank-account
holders to 85,000 pounds ($135,000), in line with European Union
guidelines.  The new limit “will be memorable and easy for consumers to
understand in the context of their own finances,” the FSA said
in a report today. The change increases by about 8 percent the
number of bank accounts covered by the existing deposit
protection program, which ring-fences as much as 50,000 pounds.  “Greater protection reduces the likelihood of any
potential run on a deposit taker,” the FSA said. “The proposed
approach provides reassurance, in particular to consumers with
deposits that were not covered under the previous 50,000 pound
limit.”  Under the EU plan, bank-account holders would get as much
as 100,000 euros of their money back within seven days. The
 European Commission  proposals, announced in July, are intended
to harmonize deposit insurance across the 27-nation region. The
U.K. introduced its current limit in 2008, in the wake of the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  The U.S.’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insures at least
$250,000 per customer, after increasing the level from $100,000.  The commission’s proposals sought to prevent a repeat of
disputes between EU member countries by demanding that banks pay
into deposit guarantee funds before crises occur.  U.K. and Dutch depositors of Iceland’s Icesave, a unit of
 Landsbanki Islands hf , were compensated by their own governments
for losses when the bank failed in 2008, causing diplomatic
tension.  To contact the reporters on this story:
