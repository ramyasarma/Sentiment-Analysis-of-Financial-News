Portugal’s auction of three-month and
12-month bills today garnered increased demand following last
week’s announcement of tax increases and wage cuts to curb the
deficit.  Portugal sold 1 billion euros of securities ($1.38
billion), matching the so-called indicative amount given by the
debt agency, known as IGCP, in September. The securities due in
January attracted bids for 3 times the amount offered, compared
with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 at a similar sale in August.
Bidders for the September 2011 securities sought 2.8 times the
amount offered, compared with the previous ratio of 1.6.  The auction “was very well received, as demand was very
strong,” said  Chiara Cremonesi , a strategist at UniCredit SpA
in London. “This is remarkable given the market isn’t very
positive about Portugal right now.”  Portugal’s budget gap was 9.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2009, the highest in the 16-country euro region after
Ireland, Greece and Spain. The government aims to narrow the
shortfall to 7.3 percent this year, 4.6 percent next year, and
intends to meet the EU limit of 3 percent in 2012.  Borrowing costs rose at the three-month auction and dropped
at the 12-month auction. The securities due in January were
issued at an average yield of 1.595 percent. That compares with
a yield of 0.994 percent at the previous auction on Aug. 18.  The bills due in September 2011 were issued at an average
yield of 3.333 percent. That compares with a yield of 3.369
percent at the previous auction on Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
