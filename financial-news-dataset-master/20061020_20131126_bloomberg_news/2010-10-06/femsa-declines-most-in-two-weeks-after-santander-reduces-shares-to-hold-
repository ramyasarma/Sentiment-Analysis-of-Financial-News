Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB , Latin
America’s largest Coca-Cola bottler, dropped the most in two
weeks after Banco Santander SA cut its recommendation.  Femsa shares declined 1.4 percent to 63.56 pesos at 11:59
a.m. New York time. The stock fell as much as 1.8 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Sept. 21.  The company was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Banco
Santander SA, according to a report by analysts led by  Luis Miranda.   “The recommendation cut may have been an important factor
in the fall at this exact moment,” said  Ana Paula Pedroni , an
analyst with IXE Grupo Financiero SAB in Mexico City.
“Investors haven’t been able to identify a significant catalyst
to boost the price of the shares in the short term.”  Pedroni rates Femsa a “buy” with a target price of 71
pesos per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
