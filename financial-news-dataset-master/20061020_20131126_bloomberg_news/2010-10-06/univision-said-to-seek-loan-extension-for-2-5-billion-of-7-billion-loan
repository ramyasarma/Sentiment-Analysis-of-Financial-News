     Oct. 6 (Bloomberg) --  Univision Communications Inc. , the
Spanish-language media company taken private for $12.3 billion
in 2007, offered initial terms to extend a portion of the loans
used in the buyout, according to three people familiar with the
negotiations.  The company is seeking to delay the maturity on $2.5
billion of its $7 billion term loan by 2.5 years to March 2017,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private.  Univision is offering to increase the interest rate on the
extended term loan by 1.75 percentage point to 4 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, the people
said. Libor is the rate banks charge to lend to each other.  Extending lenders would also get an amendment fee of 5
basis points, or 0.05 percent, the people said. The New York-
based company also is proposing to repay $750 million of the
term loan with the proceeds of a secured bond sale, the people
said.  Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America Corp. initiated lender
talks today, the people said. Lenders have until Oct. 19 to
submit responses and the transaction is expected to be completed
Oct. 22, said the people.  The term loan backed the LBO of the company by Madison
Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence Equity Partners LLC, Saban
Capital Group Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners and TPG Capital.  Monica Talan , a spokeswoman for Univision, declined
immediate comment on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
