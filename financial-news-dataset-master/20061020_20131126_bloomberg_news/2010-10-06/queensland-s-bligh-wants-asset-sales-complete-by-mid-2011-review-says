Queensland state Premier Anna Bligh
is seeking to complete asset sales totaling A$16 billion by the
middle of next year, earlier than the original December
timeframe, the Australian Financial Review reported in its
Street Talk column, without citing sources. The government wants
to finish the sales before state elections in early 2012,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
