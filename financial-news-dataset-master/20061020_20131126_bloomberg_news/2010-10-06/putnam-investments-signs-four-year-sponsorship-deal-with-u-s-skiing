Putnam Investments LLC, a U.S.-based
investment advisory firm with $120 billion in assets under
management, will sponsor the  U.S. ski and snowboarding team  for
four years.  “It was an opportunistic chance for us to get involved
with a program and a sport that represents the U.S. but also has
worldwide reach,”  Robert Reynolds , president and chief
executive officer of Putnam Investments, said in an interview
from Boston today.  Putnam, which has also sponsored former Olympic ski
champion  Ted Ligety  for the past two years, didn’t disclose
financial terms of the deal. Its company logo will appear on the
uniforms of the U.S. Alpine, freestyle and Nordic teams.  American skiers and snowboarders left the Vancouver Winter
Olympics in February with a record 21 medals, including six
golds. The next Winter Games are set for Sochi, Russia, in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
