Hog futures fell on signs that animal
supplies are outpacing U.S. demand for pork. Cattle futures also
dropped.  Wholesale pork  fell 2.5 percent yesterday, to 85.21 cents a
pound, the lowest level since July 21. In the week ended Oct. 2,
the average weight of hogs slaughtered in the Iowa-Southern
Minnesota region rose 0.9 percent to 270.7 pounds (122.8
kilograms) from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today.  Prices fell on “concern about weakness in the wholesale
market,” said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures Insights
in Altus, Arkansas. “Traders are concerned that the rise in
weights and supply of hogs available for sale in the very near
future is increasing as well.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.05 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at 72.2 cents a pound at 1:03 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price dropped as much
as 0.7 percent. The commodity has climbed 10 percent this year.  Yesterday,  wholesale  pork-belly prices tumbled 12 percent,
the biggest decline since August 2009, to $1.0746 a pound, USDA
data show. Pork bellies are cured and sliced to make bacon.  “Seasonally, demand tends to slide and also the prices
were just so high,” said  Tom Cawthorne , the director of hog
marketing at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “End users
are starting to balk. They just got to be too expensive.”  The price was down for the 11th straight session, tumbling
32 percent. It rose to a record $1.5725 on Sept. 16.  Pork-belly futures for February delivery fell by the CME’s
daily limit of 3 cents, or 2.8 percent, to close at $1.045 a
pound.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 cent, or
0.6 percent, to settle at 97.075 cents a pound. Earlier the
price touched 96.8 cents, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Sept. 9. The commodity has gained 13 percent in
2010.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 0.25
cent, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $1.0925 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
