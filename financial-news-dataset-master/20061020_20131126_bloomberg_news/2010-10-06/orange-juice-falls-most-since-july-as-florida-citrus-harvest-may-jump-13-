Orange-juice futures plunged the most
since July on expectations for a bigger citrus crop in Florida,
the world’s second-largest grower.  Florida’s harvest may jump 13 percent to 150.7 million
boxes as groves recover from a freeze in January, according the
average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first crop
estimate for this season’s crop on Oct. 8.  “There’s a lot of volatility ahead of Friday’s report,”
said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Market
in Chicago.  Orange juice for November delivery fell 8.05 cents, or
5.1 percent, to settle at $1.5045 a pound at 2:01 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest decline since July 8.
Earlier, the price touched $1.4855, the lowest level since Sept.
29.  Futures have surged 60 percent in the past 12 months,
partly on concern that frost damaged Florida groves. Last month,
storms threatened the state.  The crop collected earlier this year dropped to 133.6
million boxes of oranges, the second-smallest in two decades. A
box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Brazil is the biggest grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
