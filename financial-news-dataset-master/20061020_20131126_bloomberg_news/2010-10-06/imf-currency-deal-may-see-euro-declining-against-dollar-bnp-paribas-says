The euro may fall against the dollar
if a deal is reached at the International Monetary Fund’s
meeting in Washington this weekend to allow Asian currencies to
rise against the greenback, according to BNP Paribas SA.  “Should there be a deal in Washington suggesting Asian
currencies to appreciate at a faster pace up to their fair
values, dollar weakness would be ‘re-channelled’ away from
European currencies,” strategists led by Hans-Guenter Redeker
in London, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
