Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
European Union should refrain from pressing for a stronger yuan
on foreign-exchange markets, saying the U.S. dollar is the
source of the EU’s currency concerns.  “Europe shouldn’t join the choir to press China to allow
more yuan appreciation,” Wen said in a speech at a meeting of
business leaders today in Brussels. “The euro had a big
fluctuation recently. It’s not because of yuan but the dollars.
We shouldn’t be blamed for it; if there’s someone to be
questioned, it should be the U.S.”  Minutes earlier at the same event, European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  urged China to let the yuan’s exchange
rate strengthen further, highlighting Europe’s frustration at
the extent of the currency’s appreciation since Chinese
officials eased it off a two-year peg to the dollar in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
