Detroit Public Schools , whose
enrollment has plummeted nearly 100,000 since 1997, issued $210
million in Qualified School Construction and Build America bonds
today.  The district is in its second year of state-ordered
emergency financial management. The bonds are backed by the
state and an unlimited tax general-obligation pledge. Managers
at Siebert Brandford Shank & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
underwriting the deal, rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
third-highest and one level above S&P’s AA- rating.  Detroit’s district is Michigan’s largest. Its deficit for
fiscal year 2011 is $363 million in a $1.025 billion budget.
Target enrollment this year is 77,314, according to the
district, which last week said there were 5,000 fewer in class.  Enrollment determines how much financial backing the
district, which closed 30 schools at the end of last year, will
receive from the state.  The 19-year school construction bonds, in which the
interest is refunded by the federal government, were priced to
yield 6.65 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
30-year Build America Bonds were priced to yield at 6.85
percent.  Build America Bonds, created as part of the $787 billion
federal stimulus program to encourage capital spending, are
taxable bonds for which the federal government covers 35 percent
of the interest cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
