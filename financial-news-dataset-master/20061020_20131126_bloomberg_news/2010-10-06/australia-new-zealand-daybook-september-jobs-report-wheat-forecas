---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: Most U.S. stocks fell after a report showing an

said it will start selling its stake in the Buffalo, New York-
based lender.

0.1 percent, to 10,943.13.  See {NXTW NSN L9VTN01A74E9  London: European stocks climbed amid speculation that central

the 4:30 p.m. close in London.
*National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European

50 Index climbed 0.5 percent to 3,235.04 at the 5 p.m. close in
