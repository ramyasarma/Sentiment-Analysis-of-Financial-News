Brazil’s real fell from a two-year
high as investors pared bets for the currency’s advance
following the doubling of the country’s tax on foreign
investment in fixed-income securities to 4 percent.  The real weakened the most since Aug. 11, decreasing 0.9
percent to 1.6788 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, from
1.6632 yesterday.  “I would definitely attribute it to the impact of the new
IOF tax hike,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an economist with Wells
Fargo & Co. in New York. “I don’t expect it will dampen the
long-term trend, but it’ll definitely have some short-term
impacts.”  Even after the so-called IOF tax increase was announced
after the market closed on Oct. 4, Brazil’s real surged 2.1
percent yesterday as the South American nation’s efforts to stem
the currency’s appreciation were overshadowed by a Japanese
interest-rate cut. The Bank of Japan reduced the overnight call
rate target to a range of zero to 0.1 percent, the lowest since
2006, and said it would set up a fund to buy bonds.  Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday
that more time is needed to judge the impact that the hike on
the IOF tax would have on the real.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 11.44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
