Midas Holdings Ltd. , a maker of
aluminum alloy profiles used in train carriages, plans to raise
manufacturing capacity in China by an additional 40 percent as
the nation boosts high-speed rail and subway spending.  Singapore-based Midas wants to be able to produce 70,000
tons annually by the first half of 2012, Chief Executive Officer
 Patrick Chew  said in an interview today in Hong Kong. Annual
capacity is already set to grow to 50,000 tons by the end of
this year from 20,000 tons, he said.  China will spend more than 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion)
to triple the size of its subway system over the next five years
to help ease traffic congestion and improve connectivity for
commuters. The nation is also lengthening its high-speed rail
network as part of a 2 trillion yuan  project .  “We’re very positive about the railway industry in China
given the vast amount the government is spending in high-speed
railway and the metro trains,” Chew said. “The momentum of
China’s investment is still good.”  The Singapore-listed company started trading in Hong Kong
today and closed at HK$5.83, an increase of 7.4 percent from its
initial public offering price. The benchmark Hang Seng Index
gained 1.1 percent. Midas fell 1 percent to S$1 at 4:44 p.m. in
Singapore.  Midas sold 220 million shares at HK$5.43 apiece, raising
net proceeds of about HK$1.1 billion ($142 million), the company
said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday. The
money raised in its secondary listing in Hong Kong will help
fund Midas’s expansion through 2012, Chew said.  Net income  in the second quarter rose 18 percent to S$11.1
million ($8.5 million) as sales gained 26 percent to S$47.6
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
