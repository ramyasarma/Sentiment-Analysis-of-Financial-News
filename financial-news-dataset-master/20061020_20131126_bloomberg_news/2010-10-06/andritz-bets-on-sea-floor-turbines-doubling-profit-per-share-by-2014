Andritz AG , the world’s second-
biggest maker of hydropower plants, is wagering that turbines
installed on ocean floors will supply a portion of future energy
use, Chief Executive Officer  Wolfgang Leitner  said.  Andritz expects its investments in such new-energy
technologies will increase profit, he said today at a briefing
in Vienna. The Graz, Austria-based company is looking to provide
venture capital to start-up companies as it seeks to more than
double  earnings per share  by 2014 to 4.15 euros, he said.  “Everyone is looking for new renewable energy technologies
and resources,” Leitner said. “Ocean turbines have a number of
advantages, including being out of eyesight and providing
predictable energy generation.”  The Austrian company in August acquired a 33 percent stake
in  Hammerfest Strom SA , the Norwegian tidal-technology developer
installing a 1-megawatt tidal-stream turbine off Scotland’s
coast.  Spain’s Iberdrola SA and Norway’s Statoil ASA are also
investing in the project, which will install a test turbine next
year at the European Marine Energy Center in Orkney, Scotland.  Andritz shares rose as much as 2.4 percent to a 3-year high
in Vienna, to 53.74 a share at 12:46 a.m. local time. The
company said it wants to raise its  dividend  payout ratio to 60
percent from 50 percent by 2014.  France’s Alstom SA is the world’s biggest maker of
hydropower plants.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
