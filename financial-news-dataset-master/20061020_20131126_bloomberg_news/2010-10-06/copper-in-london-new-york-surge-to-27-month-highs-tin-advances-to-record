Copper in London and New York climbed
for a second day to the highest level in almost 27 months on
expectations the dollar will weaken further as the Federal
Reserve may join Japan’s central bank in taking quantitative
easing measures to stimulate growth. Tin advanced to a record.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1.6 percent to $8,308 a metric ton, the
highest price since July 15, 2008, and traded at $8,287 at 2:13
p.m. in Singapore. Zinc, lead, nickel and aluminum increased to
five-month highs.  The December-delivery contract on the Comex in New York
gained as much as 1.5 percent to $3.7805 a pound, also the
highest level since July 15, 2008. The Shanghai Futures Exchange
is closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day holiday.  “Accelerating weakness in the U.S. currency, driven by
fears of renewed quantitative easing to confront sluggish
growth, is proving to be a boon to commodity markets, especially
as growth risks from the European sovereign debt crisis, policy
tightening in China and high unemployment in the U.S. and Europe
persist,” Morgan Stanley analysts including  Peter Richardson 
wrote in a quarterly report today.  The  dollar  declined for a second day to the lowest level
since January against a six-currency basket including the yen
and euro. The Bank of Japan yesterday cut borrowing costs for
the first time since 2008 and set up a 5 trillion yen ($60
billion) fund to buy state bonds and other assets.  U.S. initial jobless claims increased by 2,000 to 455,000
in the week ended Oct. 2, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists ahead of tomorrow’s data, adding to expectations
that the Fed will take steps to boost the world’s biggest
economy. The unemployment rate climbed to 9.7 percent in
September from 9.6 percent in August, according to a separate
survey before an Oct. 8 report.  Copper Targets  Morgan Stanley today raised its copper forecasts through
2012 on “resilient Chinese demand.” The metal may average
$3.31 a pound ($7,300 a ton) this year, up 3 percent from an
earlier target of $3.21, the bank said in the report. It may
average $3.60 in 2011 and $3.80 in 2012, up as much as 10
percent from previous estimates, the report said. The metal used
in construction and appliances peaked at $8,940 on July 2, 2008.  Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in predicting
higher prices. Goldman yesterday estimated copper would trade at
$11,000 a ton in a year, up 37 percent from a previous estimate,
as demand is expected to outpace supplies. The metal will be at
$8,500 in three months and $8,800 in six months, the bank’s
analysts including Joshua Crumb said in a report yesterday.
Goldman also forecast copper to average $7,475 a ton in 2010 and
$9,300 a ton in 2011. The metal has averaged $7,220 a ton so far
this year.  Tin Record  Tin, the London Metal Exchange’s best performer this year,
advanced to a record for a second day as shrinking global
inventories and output disruptions raised concerns that supply
may lag behind demand. The metal gained 2.6 percent to $26,600 a
ton, a 55 percent jump this year.  Stockpiles  tracked by the London Metal Exchange have
dropped 53 percent this year, falling to a 17-month low of
12,495 tons on Oct. 1. Exports from Indonesia, the world’s
biggest, declined for the first eight months of this year to
60,107 tons from 67,797.54 tons a year earlier, the Ministry of
Trade in Jakarta said on Sept. 22.  Output in China, the world’s largest producer, may be
restricted through the end of the year because of limitations on
power use, tin industry group ITRI Ltd. said on Sept. 29. A
general ban on mining was imposed last month in three eastern
provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa’s largest
tin producer.  Metals, Equities  Zinc, the LME’s worst performer, rose as much as 1.4
percent to $2,345 a ton, the highest price since April 29.
Nickel gained as much as 1.9 percent to $25,200 a ton, the
highest level since May 4.  Aluminum rose as much as 0.9 percent to $2,400.50 a ton,
the highest since April 21. Lead added as much as 1.5 percent to
$2,345, the highest since April 26.  “The combined influence of improving physical market
fundamentals, continued investment demand and, in some cases,
inventory financing arrangements or exchange-traded funds” will
drive base metals prices higher, said Richardson.  Morgan Stanley’s top picks for metals are copper, tin and
nickel as they have the “potent combination of sustained
emerging market demand growth, limited refined production growth
and low inventories.”  The rally in metals prices drove gains in related equities.
The  MCSI World/Materials Index , a measure of mining and chemical
companies, rose for a second day to the highest level since
April 16.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company,
gained as much as 2.6 percent in Sydney, and shares of  Rio Tinto
Group , the world’s third-largest mining company, jumped to the
highest price since April 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
