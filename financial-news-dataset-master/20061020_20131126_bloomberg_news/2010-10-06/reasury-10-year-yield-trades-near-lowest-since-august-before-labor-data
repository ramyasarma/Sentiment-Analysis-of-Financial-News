Treasury 10-year yields were four
basis points away from the lowest level since August on
speculation data this week will show deterioration in the U.S.
labor market, supporting demand for safer assets.  Two-year yields were near a record low as economists said
figures tomorrow will show initial claims for jobless insurance
rose and data the next day will indicate the unemployment rate
increased. Government note rates fell this week as investors
prepared for the Federal Reserve to follow the Bank of Japan in
increasing purchases of debt.  “The recovery is still very slow,” said Takashi Yamamoto,
chief trader in Singapore at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking
Corp., part of Japan’s biggest lender. “I’m still bullish.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell one basis
point to 2.47 percent at 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
BGCantor Market Data. It declined to 2.43 percent yesterday, the
least since Aug. 25. The 2.625 percent security maturing in
August 2020 traded at a price of 101 3/8.  Two-year  notes  yielded 0.41 percent, versus the record low
of 0.3987 percent set Oct. 4.  Treasury 30-year bonds fell yesterday on speculation the
central bank will focus on shorter-maturity debt if policy
makers expand purchases of government securities to sustain the
economic recovery.  “The Fed is likely to buy Treasuries concentrated in the
intermediate part of the curve,” said  Richard Bryant , senior
vice president for fixed income at MF Global Inc. in New York, a
broker of exchange-traded futures. “In buying back Treasuries,
they are unlikely to extend much of their purchases past the 10-
year.”  Fed Following  Japan’s decision yesterday to buy $60 billion of assets and
cut its benchmark interest rate to stimulate growth spurred
expectations the Fed will follow suit. The Bank of Japan lowered
its key rate to a range of zero percent to 0.1 percent from the
previous 0.1 percent target.  U.S. initial jobless claims increased by 2,000 to 455,000
in the week ended Oct. 2, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists ahead of tomorrow’s data. The unemployment rate
climbed to 9.7 in September from 9.6 percent in August,
according to a separate survey ahead of the Oct. 8 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
