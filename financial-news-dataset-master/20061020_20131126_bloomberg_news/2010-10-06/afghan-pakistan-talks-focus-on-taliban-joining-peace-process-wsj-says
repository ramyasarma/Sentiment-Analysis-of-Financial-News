Afghan government officials held
talks with Pakistani security chiefs and former members of the
Taliban to discuss bringing the movement fighting President
 Hamid Karzai ’s government to peace talks, the Wall Street
Journal reported.  The meetings, held on Oct. 5-6 in Kabul, were sponsored by
the United Arab Emirates and didn’t involve any current Taliban
members, the Journal reported. Afghan officials said the
government would be ready to abandon some of its demands, such
as the Taliban recognizing the Afghan Constitution, in an
attempt to start peace negotiations, the newspaper said.  “Peace means that all the conditions of one side cannot be
accepted, and both sides must compromise,” the report cited
 Nematullah Shahrani , Karzai’s Islamic affairs adviser, as
saying.  In return, the Taliban would be expected to abandon their
demand for the immediate departure of all foreign forces as a
precondition for talks. The U.S. is supportive of discussions
between the Taliban and the Afghan government and the process of
reconciliation in the country, White House press secretary
 Robert Gibbs , said yesterday in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
