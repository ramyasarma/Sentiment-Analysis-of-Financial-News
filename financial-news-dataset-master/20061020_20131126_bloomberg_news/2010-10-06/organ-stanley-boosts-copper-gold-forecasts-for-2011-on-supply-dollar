Morgan Stanley boosted its 2011 price
forecasts for gold and copper, and recommended equities
including  Xstrata Plc  and  Kazakhmys Plc , because of expected
supply constraints and a weak dollar.  “Accelerating weakness in the U.S. currency, driven by
fears of renewed quantitative easing to confront sluggish U.S.
growth, is proving to be a boon to commodity markets,” Morgan
Stanley metals and mining analysts led by  Peter Richardson  said.
Gains will be supported by “resilient growth in emerging
markets,” they said.  Gold prices are expected to average $1,315 an ounce, 14
percent higher than Morgan Stanley’s previous forecast, and
copper $3.80 a pound, up 10 percent.  Iron-ore  prices are set to
trade next year at $135 a ton, unchanged on the bank’s previous
forecast, and up from an average $122 a ton for this year.  “Despite some persistent market concerns about the
strength of demand for steel-making raw materials in 2011-12,
and fears regarding the growth in new capacity over this
timeframe, especially in iron ore, our fundamental analysis
highlights continued strength in premium products,” Morgan
Stanley said.  Seaborne markets will struggle to provide sufficient supply
to match anticipated growth in steel production, at least until
2012, it said.  Other companies Morgan Stanley favored were  Kobe Steel
Ltd. ,  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. , Tata Steel Ltd., Posco and
 Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.   To contact the reporter on this story:
