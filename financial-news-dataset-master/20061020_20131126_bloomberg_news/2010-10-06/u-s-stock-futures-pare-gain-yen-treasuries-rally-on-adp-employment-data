U.S. stock futures trimmed gains,
while Treasuries rallied and the yen strengthened to a 15-year
high versus the dollar, after a report showed private employers
unexpectedly cut jobs last month.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December rose 0.1 percent to 1,155.8 at 8:17 a.m. in New York
after climbing 0.4 percent earlier.  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
futures gained 18 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,882. The yen
strengthened to 82.77 per dollar and the 10-year Treasury note’s
yield lost 5 basis points to 2.42 percent.  Employment decreased by 39,000, according to figures today
from ADP Employer Services. The median estimate of 37 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a gain of 20,000.
Forecasts ranged from a decline of 44,000 to a 75,000 increase.  The ADP report came two days before the Labor Department’s
monthly payrolls data, which is forecast to show companies added
75,000 people in September.  The  S&P 500  climbed to the highest level since May
yesterday after U.S. service industries expanded more than
forecast and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will join
Japan’s efforts to stoke economic growth. The index must gain
0.4 percent to reach its level on May 5, the day before the 20-
minute crash that briefly erased $862 billion from the value of
U.S. shares.  In the past week, New York Federal Reserve President
William Dudley, the Boston Fed’s Eric Rosengren and Chicago’s
Charles Evans have advocated further Fed action to stoke the
economy. Dudley’s Oct. 1 speech was “a strong signal” that the
FOMC will restart asset purchases at its next meeting on Nov. 2-
3, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Edward
McKelvey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
