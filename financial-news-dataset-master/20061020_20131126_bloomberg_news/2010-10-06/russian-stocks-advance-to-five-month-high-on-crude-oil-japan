Russian stocks surged to their
highest in more than five months as oil and metals gained on
U.S. service expansion and speculation more central banks will
act to spur economic growth after the Bank of Japan yesterday
cut rates.  OAO Lukoil , the country’s second-largest oil producer,
rallied 0.8 percent.  OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas export monopoly,
advanced 0.4 percent to 163.1 rubles. These movements helped to
push the Micex Index higher for a sixth day by 0.3 percent to
1,477.9 at 11:32 a.m. in Moscow, the benchmark’s highest
intraday level since April 27 as fears have eased that the
global recovery is faltering.  Oil traded near a five-month high after U.S. service
companies expanded faster than forecast and an industry report
showed gasoline inventories in the world’s biggest consumer of
crude declined the most since May 2009. Japan’s central bank
yesterday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate for the
first time since 2008 and pledged to hold it at “virtually
zero.”  “Investors increasingly believe that a strong fourth-
quarter rally in global markets is realistic,” said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Financial Corp, in an e-
mailed report. “Governments are more openly talking about
another round of quantitative easing. That will provide strong
support for commodities and commodity-based investment themes.
Russian equities and the ruble are chief amongst them.”  Copper in London and New York climbed for a second day to
its highest level in almost 27 months. OAO Norilsk Nickel,
Russia’s largest miner, added 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
