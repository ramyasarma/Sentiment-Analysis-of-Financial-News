Lockheed Martin Corp. ’s F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter resumed flight tests after corrections were made
to a software flaw with the jet’s fuel pumps, a company
spokesman said.  “The flight suspension has been lifted,” the spokesman,
 John Kent , said today in an e-mailed statement. “Over the
weekend, we loaded the software solution onto the flight test
aircraft. This morning we received clearance to fly the two
aircraft.”  Test aircraft of all three F-35 variants were grounded Oct.
1 after lab tests revealed a fault in software that controls
three fuel-boost pumps, raising concern they could shut down
during flight and stall the engine.  Development and combat testing of the F-35 is more than
four years behind schedule. Different versions of the jet are
designed to be used, with modifications, by the Air Force, Navy
and Marine Corps, instead of each service buying its own planes.
The JSF is the most-expensive U.S. weapons program, with costs
surging 65 percent since 2002 to $382.4 billion.  The grounding isn’t “a serious setback,”  Geoff Morrell , a
Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. “This is precisely why we
have a test program: to try to encounter problems early, fix
them, and move on from that.”  Lockheed and the Pentagon announced a Sept. 22 agreement
for the fourth batch of early production models valued at more
than $5 billion. With that accord, Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed has 63 planes on its books.  The U.S. plans to buy 2,473 F-35s, and eight international
partners may buy 700 more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
