Investors in U.S.  Treasuries  are
enjoying the “best of all worlds” as the Federal Reserve
struggles to boost inflation expectations and data points to
slower growth, Societe General SA said.  “We may have come a long way, and nirvana it may be, but
we haven’t yet found the holy grail,”  Ciaran O’Hagan , a fixed-
income strategist in Paris, wrote today in a research report.
“There is a belief that the Fed is both impotent and too late.
The near-term data calendar is looking promising -- for bond
holders, that is. Friday’s employment report should be the final
clincher” for an expansion of asset purchases by the central
bank, O’Hagan wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
