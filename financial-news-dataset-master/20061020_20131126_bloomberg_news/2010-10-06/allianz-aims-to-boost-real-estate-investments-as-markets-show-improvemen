Allianz SE , Europe’s largest insurer,
said it’s seeking to boost real-estate investments to help
offset lower returns from other asset classes such as fixed-
income securities and equities.  “Markets have improved overall, the fundamentals of real
estate are not bad today,”  Olivier Piani , head of Allianz Real
Estate, said at a press conference in Munich today. To raise
real estate to about 6 percent from 4 percent of Allianz’s
investments, the insurer has to buy about 10 billion euros ($14
billion) in additional property, he said.  Allianz has said it  aims  to boost real-estate assets to
about 30 billion euros from 17 billion euros in coming years.
The insurer’s property  division , which has invested about 1.5
billion euros of real estate in 2010, plans to add another 1
billion euros by year-end, with a focus on shopping centers and
office buildings.  “Vacancy rates in most markets are totally acceptable,
there is no oversupply of commercial assets and rents have been
soft but not declining anymore in most major markets,” Piani
said today.  Purchases by Munich-based Allianz this year include the 10-
story Triton office building in Frankfurt’s Westend district and
real estate from German retailer Aldi.  The country’s insurers are investing in properties to help
make up for lower returns from fixed-income securities and
equities. Talanx AG, Germany’s third-biggest insurer, is also
seeking to raise holdings in real estate, Chief Financial
Officer  Immo Querner  said in an interview in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
