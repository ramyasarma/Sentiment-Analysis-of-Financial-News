China’s efforts to limit carbon
emissions have gone through “some pretty significant changes”
in the past year, said Chicago Climate Exchange Inc.’s Jeff
Huang.  China now has a dozen environmental exchanges where
companies can buy and sell pollution permits after the first
three were set up last year in Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai,
according to Huang, the assistant chairman of the Tianjin
Climate Exchange.  “There are real efforts in China on the ground by
financial people working together with emitters, with the big
corporations, about what can be done,” he said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television. For example, “can markets be applied
in China so that these corporations can meet their compliance
goal which is carbon constrained?”  Delegates from 177 countries are in Tianjin in northern
China this week to try and negotiate a global agreement on
limiting carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels and cutting
down forests. China, the world’s biggest polluter, announced
ahead of last year’s climate summit in Copenhagen that it would
reduce the amount of carbon emitted for each unit of economic
growth by as much as 45 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
