Soybean and corn futures fell in
Chicago as dry weather allows farmers to speed up harvesting in
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  Little rain is expected in the Midwest during the next 10
days, which will help late-developing crops mature and keep the
soil firm enough for farming equipment, said  Mike Tannura , the
president of T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago. About 37 percent of
the  crops  were harvested as of Oct. 3, 16 percentage points more
than the five-year average for corn and 9 percentage points more
for soybeans, the Department of Agriculture said this week.  “The weather is still very favorable for U.S.
harvesting,” said  Bill Nelson , a senior economist at Doane
Advisory Services Co. in St. Louis. “The market is getting
crops delivered from earlier forward sales by farmers, and high
prices are encouraging more selling straight from the combine.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 9.75 cents, or
0.9 percent, to close at $10.62 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop in three sessions. On
Sept. 27, the oilseed reached a 15-month high of $11.44.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.5
percent to close at $4.885 a bushel, the first drop this week. 
On Sept. 27, the most-active contract reached $5.2875, the 
highest price since September 2008. The grain surged 4.1 percent 
yesterday on speculation the government will cut its production 
forecast in a report scheduled for Oct. 8.  Trading Slowed  Trading in Chicago slowed today as few investors were
willing to take new positions before the USDA report is
released, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
in West Des Moines, Iowa.  December futures trading totaled 122,394 contracts, down
from 190,463 yesterday, based on preliminary exchange data for
electronic transactions on the CBOT. November soybeans fell to
54,305 contracts from 82,679 contracts yesterday.  “There is a lot of uncertainty about the size of the crop,
and that will slow trading,” Roose said. “People want to wait
for the new estimates.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans at $31.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
