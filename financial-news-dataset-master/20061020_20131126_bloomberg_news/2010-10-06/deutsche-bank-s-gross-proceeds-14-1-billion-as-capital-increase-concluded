Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s largest
bank, completed a record 10.2 billion-euro ($14.1 billion) share
sale to fund the takeover of  Deutsche Postbank AG  and increase
reserves.  More than 99 percent of the subscription rights were
exercised with 306.51 million new shares sold at 33 euros
apiece, the Frankfurt-based bank  said  today. The remaining 2.13
million shares will be sold on the stock exchange, Deutsche Bank
said.  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  conducted Europe’s
largest share sale so far this year to finance a takeover offer
for Postbank, which would boost the firm’s retail clients to 24
million in Germany. The funds will also help Deutsche Bank
fulfill new regulatory requirements by the end of 2013,
Ackermann said last month.  “The successful capital increase is an impressive
demonstration of the trust in Deutsche Bank’s perspectives for
the future,” Ackermann said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
