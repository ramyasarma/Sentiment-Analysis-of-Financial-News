Monsanto Co. , the world’s largest
seed company, predicted full-year profit to rebound as much as
17 percent amid stronger genetically modified crop sales in the
U.S. and Latin America.  Earnings in the year that began Sept. 1 will rise to $2.72
to $2.82 a share, excluding some items, from $2.41 in fiscal
2010, St. Louis-based Monsanto said today in a statement. The
average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.82.  Chief Executive Officer  Hugh Grant  is trying to improve
earnings by selling more engineered corn and soybean seeds in
the U.S., Brazil and Argentina while eliminating jobs at the
unit that makes Roundup herbicide. Net income dropped 47 percent
in fiscal 2010 because of competition from generic competitors
to Roundup.  “The 13 percent to 17 percent annual growth rate is what
people were looking for,”  Laurence Alexander , a New York-based
analyst at Jefferies & Co. who has a “hold” recommendation on
the stock, said by telephone. “They checked off enough boxes to
let people feel the shares should stabilize here.”  Monsanto  rose  13 cents to $48.65 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 40
percent this year, the fourth-biggest decline on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index .  Corn, Soybeans  The company’s  net loss  in the three months ended Aug. 31
narrowed to $143 million, or 26 cents a share, from $233
million, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring
costs, the loss was 9 cents a share, trailing the 6-cent average
of 14 analyst  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. Sales climbed 3.9
percent to $1.95 billion.  Monsanto’s first- and fourth-quarter earnings are typically
weaker than in the rest of year, when farmers in North America
and Europe plant most of their crops.  The wider-than-expected loss was due to increased overhead
costs in the seed business,  Jeffrey J. Zekauskas , a New York-
based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a report. Sales
of corn, soybean and cotton seeds were better than estimated, he
said.  Increased sales of modified seeds, particularly corn and
soybeans, will drive Monsanto’s earnings starting in 2011, Grant
said on a conference call today. Concerns about the performance
of SmartStax corn, which was developed with  Dow Chemical Co.  to
kill bugs and withstand herbicide with eight added genes, are
premature, he said.  SmartStax Results  SmartStax seeds, billed in December as “the highest
yielding corn product available,” so far aren’t yielding more
than cheaper triple-stack seeds, which have three added genes,
Monsanto said. That’s because insect populations have been low
and SmartStax is available in only 30 hybrids this year,
compared with more than 300 triple-stack varieties, Chief
Technology Officer  Robert Fraley  said on the call.  Early harvests from southern regions where two hybrids
responded poorly to evening heat have so far skewed overall
yield data, Fraley said. SmartStax results will improve as the
harvest moves to the northern U.S., where a greater variety of
hybrids were planted, Fraley said. By 2012, SmartStax will be
available in 100 varieties, he said.  DuPont has taken the lead in the U.S. soybean-seed market
with 30 percent of sales this year. Monsanto’s soybean share
fell as much as 3 percent in 2010 from 28.5 percent in 2009.  Corn Seed Share  Monsanto Chief Financial Officer  Carl Casale  said today the
company’s U.S. corn seed share fell “slightly” from 2009 as
the DeKalb brand share was unchanged, while the American Seeds
unit dropped.  Kelli Powers , a spokeswoman, declined to specify
the drop.  SmartStax was planted on 3 million acres this year. By
2011, the company forecasts the millions of acres will be in the
“mid-teens” for SmartStax and lower priced seeds that offer a
similar reduction in required plantings of conventional seed
needed to combat insecticide resistance. Casale declined to
specify the SmartStax target.  Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, which were planted on 6
million acres this year, will be planted on “mid-teens”
millions of acres next year, Monsanto said. Yields so far are
meeting company projections for a 7 percent to 11 percent
improvement versus the original herbicide-tolerant soybean seed,
Grant said.  Gross profit from seeds in 2011 will rise to $5.1 billion
to $5.2 billion from $4.54 billion in 2010, Monsanto said. Gross
profit in the agricultural productivity unit, which makes
herbicides, will rise to $550 million to $600 million in 2011,
from $548 million in 2010, Monsanto said. That includes $250
million to $300 million in profit from Roundup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
