Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter in
his first postseason start, giving the Philadelphia Phillies a
4-0 win against the Cincinnati Reds in the opening game of their
National League division series.  Halladay, who was acquired by the Phillies during the
offseason from the Toronto Blue Jays, allowed only one batter to
reach base -- Jay Bruce walked with two outs in the fifth
inning.   Don Larsen is the only other pitcher with a no-hitter
during the postseason, throwing a perfect game for the New York
Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 World Series.  Halladay struck out eight and even helped his cause by
hitting a run-scoring single  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
