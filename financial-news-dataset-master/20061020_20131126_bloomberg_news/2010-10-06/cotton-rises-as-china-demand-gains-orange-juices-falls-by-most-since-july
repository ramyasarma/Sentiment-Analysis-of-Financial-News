Cotton futures rose the most in a
week as demand increased at textile mills in China, the world’s
biggest user.  China has been selling fiber from reserves in auctions in
the past two weeks to meet mill demand, the China Cotton
Association said. The country’s markets have been closed since
Oct. 1 in observance of the National Day holidays and will open
tomorrow. Cotton futures soared 33 percent in the third quarter
on concern that global consumption will outpace supplies.  “Regardless of the fact that they’re closed, there is
still inquiry about cotton out of China,” said  Andy Ryan , a
senior-risk management consultant at FCStone Fibers & Textiles
in Nashville, Tennessee.  Cotton for December delivery rose 1.19 cents, or 1.2
percent, to 99.75 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, the biggest gain since Sept. 28.  The China Cotton Association said on Sept. 27 that demand
topped domestic production by 3.6 million metric tons in the
year ended Aug. 31. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will
update its estimates for U.S. and world production and usage on
Oct. 8.  The U.S. is the biggest exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
