Australia will cut water supply to
irrigators by 27 percent to 37 percent so it can be diverted to
environmental flows, the Australian newspaper said.  A Murray-Darling Basin Authority report scheduled to be
released tomorrow will recommend that 3,000 to 4,000 gigaliters
of water be taken away from irrigators and added to water
already diverted to the environment, the paper said, citing the
authority’s briefing with South Australia’s government.  The cuts have angered irrigators and farmers who fear the
impact on regional Australia, the paper said.  The authority will next year settle on the final figure to
apply equally to states where the Murray-Darling flows --
Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
