 The Jerusalem municipality’s
planning committee yesterday received architectural plans to
renovate the Old City’s Jewish Quarter and ease access to the
Western Wall, the daily Haaretz said, without saying where it
got the information.  The plans include building a new gate that would lead to a
tunnel and parking lot hewn into rock under the walled enclave
without harming any of the archaeological layers under the city,
the paper said.    To contact the reporter on this story:
