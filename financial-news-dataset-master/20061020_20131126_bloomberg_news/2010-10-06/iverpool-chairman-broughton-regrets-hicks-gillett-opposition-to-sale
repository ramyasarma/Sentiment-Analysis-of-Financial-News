Liverpool Chairman Martin Broughton
said the 18-time English soccer champion agreed to be bought by
John W. Henry’s Boston Red Sox holding company for about 300
million pounds ($476 million).  In an interview with Sky, Broughton said New England Sports
Ventures is the best buyer for the club, and said he regretted
that the deal was being opposed by current American owners
George Gillett and Tom Hicks.  He said the new owners planned to build a new stadium,
or redevelop Anfield, and would invest funds in buying new
players.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
