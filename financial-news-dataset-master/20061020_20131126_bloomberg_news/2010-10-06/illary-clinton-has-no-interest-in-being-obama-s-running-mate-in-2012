Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said she has no interest in replacing Vice President  Joe Biden 
on the Democratic ticket with President  Barack Obama  in 2012.  Clinton, 62, who lost the Democratic nomination to Obama in
2008 after a closely fought 17-month primary campaign, dismissed 
speculation that Obama may seek to replace Biden in an effort to
attract a broader base of support.  “I have absolutely no interest and no reason for doing
anything other than just dismissing these stories and moving
on,” said Clinton, responding to a question about the
possibility of a job-swap at Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful
Women conference in Washington. “I don’t believe what I read.”  White House press secretary  Robert Gibbs  also rebuffed
questions about a switch. “It’s not anything that’s being
discussed,” he told reporters at the White House.  Speculation about Clinton’s role in any bid by Obama for
re-election increased after  Bob Woodward , an author and editor
at the Washington Post, said in a CNN interview last night that
putting Clinton on the ticket in 2012 is “on the table.” He
said some of Clinton’s advisers “see it as a real
possibility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
