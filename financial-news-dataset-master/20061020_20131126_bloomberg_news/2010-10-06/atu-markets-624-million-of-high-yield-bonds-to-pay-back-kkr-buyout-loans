ATU Auto-Teile-Unger Group is
marketing 450 million euros ($624 million) of high-yield bonds
to repay loans used to fund the German tiremaker’s leveraged
buyout by  KKR & Co.   The company is offering 375 million euros of four-year
fixed-rate notes that may be priced to yield 11.25 percent to
11.5 percent, according to a banker involved in the transaction.
Weiden-based ATU is also offering 75 million euros of floating-
rate notes that may pay as much as 10 percentage points more
than Euribor, the banker said.  KKR bought an 80 percent stake in ATU for 1.45 billion
euros in 2004, and in February increased its holding to 99.4
percent.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing
the bond issue, the banker said. ATU announced  plans  to issue
the notes and cancel its outstanding loans on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
