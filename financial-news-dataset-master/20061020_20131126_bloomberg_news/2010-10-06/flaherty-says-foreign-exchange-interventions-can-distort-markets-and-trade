Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said countries are concerned that measures being taken
around the globe to weaken currencies are distorting markets and
trade.  “We don’t want these kind of distortions in currency
values or distortions in trading relationships,” Flaherty, 60,
said today to reporters in Ottawa.  “There is a danger here that countries that do have
currencies that trade in a market, that trade freely, are
disadvantaged by certain interventions that are made by other
countries and by inflexibility by certain currencies,” said
Flaherty, who will chair a meeting of Group of Seven finance
ministers in Washington on Friday.  Global exchange-rate policies are a source of contention
ahead of this week’s meeting in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Group of 20 officials. Brazil’s
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  last week warned of a “currency
war,” and Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said in a
speech today that a “damaging dynamic” has emerged as large
economies seek to keep their currencies undervalued.  Flaherty said intervention in currency markets will be
discussed in the “next several days” in Washington. Flaherty
also said he agreed with Geithner’s suggestion that proposed IMF
reforms to increase representation for emerging economies be
accompanied by policies such as flexible exchange rates.  “Mr. Geithner has a point, and I’ve had discussions of
late on that and other subjects” Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
