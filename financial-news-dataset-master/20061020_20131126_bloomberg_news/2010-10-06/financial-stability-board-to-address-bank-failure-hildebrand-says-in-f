The Financial Stability Board is
committed to proposing measures to the Group of 20 Nations at a
meeting next month to address the unresolved problem of a
systemically important bank facing failure, Philipp Hildebrand,
chairman of the Swiss National Bank, writes in the Financial
Times.  New Basel III minimum capital and liquidity standards leave
authorities with the “same terrible choice” about whether to
allow a large bank on the brink of failure to collapse and
accept the financial and economic turmoil or to inject taxpayer
money to keep it viable, which is an “unacceptable state of
affairs,” Hildebrand writes.  The Swiss government’s proposals, announced Oct. 4, which
include high loss absorbency capital and debt-to-equity
conversion, will “significantly mitigate” the risks posed by
its own largest banks, he writes.  Similar measures are part of the FSB’s agenda and G20
leaders will have the opportunity to integrate them into a
comprehensive global oversight framework, Hildebrand writes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
