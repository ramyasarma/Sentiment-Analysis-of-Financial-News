The Argentine unit of  Bunge Ltd ., the
country’s second-biggest exporter, denied a tax agency
accusation that it avoided paying more than 1 billion pesos
($253 million) in income taxes.  “Bunge Argentina SA complies with all its tax, customs and
welfare obligations,” the company said in a statement e-mailed
last night. The company “will make all the necessary judicial
presentations in defense of its rights and its irreproachable
commercial reputation.”  The local unit of the White Plains, New York-based company
had its Buenos Aires office raided on Oct. 1 after Judge Carlos
Ochoa initiated an investigation based on a request by the  tax 
agency, known as AFIP. On Oct. 4 the country’s tax agency said
Bunge owes the Argentine government more than 1 billion pesos in
income taxes for the past three years.  The soybean processor and exporter last paid income tax for
2006, said AFIP’s head,  Ricardo Echegaray .  Bunge said it paid more than 246 million pesos in Argentine
income taxes in 2006 and 2007. It also paid 33 million pesos in
2008 and more than 30 million pesos last year in expected
minimum income tax, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
