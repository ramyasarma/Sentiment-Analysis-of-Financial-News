Europe’s economic  recovery  may slow
in coming months as households cut back spending, companies trim
investment and export demand weakens, three of the region’s
economic research institutes said.  Gross domestic product  in the 16 euro-area nations probably
rose 0.4 percent in the third quarter after increasing 1 percent
in the previous three-month period, the Munich-based  Ifo
institute , Rome-based Isae and Insee in Paris said today in a
joint quarterly statement. Growth may ease to 0.3 percent in the
current quarter and to 0.2 percent early next year, they said.  “GDP growth in the euro zone is expected to go back to a
lower pace,” the institutes said in the e-mailed statement.
“Private consumption would flatten as the labor market is
likely to remain fragile. Furthermore, the boost to income
provided by the fiscal stimulus is to wane.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
