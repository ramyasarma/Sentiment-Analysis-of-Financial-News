ThyssenKrupp AG anticipates a pretax
profit of about 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the fiscal
year through September,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Ekkehard Schulz.  The steelmaker was helped by cost cuts to recover from a
pretax loss of 2.4 billion euros a year earlier, the newspaper
said. Fiscal 2010 sales are projected to rise to about 42
billion euros from 40.6 billion euros, as debt declined to 4
billion euros, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
