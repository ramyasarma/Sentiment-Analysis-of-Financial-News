Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. is
recalling some DB9, DBS and V8 Vantage models to fix a steering
flaw that can lead to crashes, the U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration said.  The automaker, based in Gaydon, England, will replace the
bolts holding the lower control arm in the front suspension to
prevent the possibility of cracking, NHTSA said on its  website 
today. The recall covers 1,090 U.S. cars in the 2007 and 2008
model years, and 4,110 worldwide.  In a letter notifying NHTSA of the defect in September,
Aston Martin said the bolts hadn’t been made to specification.
Broken bolts may influence steering control, the company said.  Aston Martin, whose models have been featured in James Bond
films, was owned by  Ford Motor Co.  for two decades before being
sold for 479 million pounds ($760 million) in May 2007. The
luxury carmaker is now half-owned by  Investment Dar Co. , a
Kuwaiti financial services company.  The model sticker prices range from $145,000 for the V8
Vantage to $275,000 for the DBS, which is considered the brand’s
flagship car, said Scott Morgan, a spokesman for Aston Martin
North America.  The flaw was detected through company testing, Morgan said.
No customers had complained, and the company isn’t aware of any
injuries related to it, he said. Not every car sold in the two
models years is included, he said.  If the bolt broke, the driver would be able to continue to
steer but may notice looser handling, he said. There might also
be metallic rattling, according to a letter sent to NHTSA.  “Our quality is the best it’s ever been,” Morgan said.
“This is a precautionary thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
