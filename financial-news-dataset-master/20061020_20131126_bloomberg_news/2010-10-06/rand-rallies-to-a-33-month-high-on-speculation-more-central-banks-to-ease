The rand rallied to an almost 33-
month high against the dollar as speculation interest rates in
developed nations will remain at near zero for longer boosted
investor demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  South Africa’s currency appreciated for a second day,
gaining as much as 0.6 percent to 6.8578 per dollar, the
strongest since January 2008, and traded 0.4 percent stronger at
6.8693 by 5:32 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of
6.8998. Against the euro, the rand was little changed at 9.5539.  The Bank of Japan yesterday unexpectedly cut interest rates
to as low as zero and said it would buy as much as $60 billion
of assets to keep the economy from faltering. Speculation
increased that other central bank, including the U.S. Federal
Reserve and Bank of England, may follow by easing monetary
policy and announcing further economic stimulus measures.  “Lower interest rates and gross domestic product growth in
developed countries encourages capital inflows into emerging
markets,”  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  analysts led by  Michael Keenan  in Johannesburg wrote in a client note today. Markets are
“still in favor of continued rand strength.”  The rand has surged almost 37 percent versus the dollar
since the start of last year as near-zero rates in developed
nations encourage investors to borrow cheaply and invest in
markets offering higher returns. South Africa’s 6 percent
central bank rate makes the rand a popular purchase in this
strategy, known by investors as the carry trade.  Government bonds advanced for a second day, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rising 32
cents to 125.36 rand. The yield decreased 8 basis points to 7.28
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
