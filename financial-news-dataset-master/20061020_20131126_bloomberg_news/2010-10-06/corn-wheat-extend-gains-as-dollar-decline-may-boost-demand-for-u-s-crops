Wheat may rise for a second day in
Chicago on speculation that a weakening dollar will increase
demand for U.S. crops.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell to the lowest level since January
before rebounding on speculation the U.S. will follow Japan in
buying more government debt to speed economic recovery. A weaker
dollar boosts the appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers and
makes commodities more attractive as an alternative investment.  “The dollar’s drop has pushed most commodities higher,
including grains, gold and oil,” said  Han Sung Min , a futures
broker at Seoul-based Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. “Again,
commodities were more attractive than other assets to
speculative funds.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.25 cent to $6.6375 a
bushel at 12:25 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade,
paring a climb of as much as 1.5 percent. The price has dropped
3.2 percent since the end of August.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 1.2 percent to 208 euros ($287) a metric ton.  Corn for December delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $4.895 a bushel in Chicago. The grain yesterday jumped 4.1
percent, the most in a week, on speculation that the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter, will cut its crop forecast
again after floods and hot weather damaged plants.  Corn lost 11 percent last week, the most in eight months as
the U.S. harvest advanced and the country’s Department of
Agriculture said that supplies left from last year’s crop
climbed to the highest level since 2006.  Production may fall to 12.977 billion bushels from a record
13.11 billion last year, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
On Sept. 10, the USDA reduced its estimate to 13.16 billion
bushels from 13.365 billion in August. The agency will update
its projection on Oct. 8.  Soybeans for November delivery slipped 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $10.71 a bushel. The oilseed has lost 6.4 percent
since reaching a 15-month high on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
