Asian currencies rose to a two-year
high on speculation the Federal Reserve will join the Bank of
Japan in stepping up purchases of government debt, boosting the
supply of funds that can be invested in higher-yielding assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10-most traded currencies excluding the yen, climbed to
115.19, the highest level since July 2008. South Korea’s won
added 1.1 percent to 1,118.13 per dollar as of the 3 p.m. close
in Seoul and touched a five-month high of 1,117.65, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Thailand’s baht climbed 0.7 percent
to 29.94, rising beyond 30 for the first time since July 1997.  “The Bank of Japan cut rates yesterday and embarked on
quantitative easing and the market is now expecting such a move
from the Fed,” said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , Hong Kong-based chief
economist for Credit Agricole CIB. “This cheap liquidity will
not stay in the domestic countries but look for higher yields
abroad, especially in Asia.”  Japan announced yesterday it will buy as much as $60
billion of assets after cutting its benchmark interest rate to
as low as zero to stimulate growth. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said on Oct. 4 that the central bank aided the U.S. economy
through its $1.75 trillion purchases of mortgage debt and
Treasuries that ended in March 2010 and that further buying
would likely help more.  Nine of the 10 most-actively-traded currencies in Asia
outside Japan have gained against the dollar this year, led by
the Thai baht and Malaysia’s ringgit. Overseas funds have poured
money into the region as economic growth outpaces the U.S. and
Europe.  Taiwan Economy  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in
2010, compared with growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries,
the International Monetary Fund forecast in July. Foreign
investors bought more than $35 billion of stocks in India, South
Korea and Taiwan than they sold this year, according to exchange
data.  Taiwan’s dollar rose as much as 1.5 percent before paring
gains in the last minute of trading due to suspected
intervention by the central bank. It advanced 0.4 percent to
NT$31.132, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The currency has gained 0.6 percent since the central bank
on Sept. 30 raised its  policy rate  for the second time this year
to 1.5 percent from 1.375 percent. A government report tomorrow
may show exports increased for an 11th straight month in
September. Overseas sales, which account for more than two-
thirds of Taiwan’s economy, climbed 26.6 percent from a year
earlier, the same pace as in August, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Higher Returns  Thailand’s baht has appreciated more than 11 percent this
year, the best performance among Asia’s most-traded currencies
excluding the yen. The Bank of Thailand yesterday issued details
on deregulating currency transactions to enable local businesses
to more effectively manage foreign-exchange risk.  “The BOJ’s move triggered speculation the pace of fund
inflows to emerging Asia will quicken, boosting regional
currencies,” said  Kozo Hasegawa , a Bangkok-based foreign-
exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Quantitative
easing means there will be more money seeking higher returns.”  It is normal to see inflows of funds because the economy is
strong, Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Atchana Waiquamdee said
today. The finance ministry said Sept. 27 the economy may expand
as much as 7.8 percent this year, the fastest growth since 1995.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.2 percent to 8,923
per dollar and Singapore’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to
S$1.3094. Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.2 percent to 3.0903, while
the Philippine peso climbed 0.6 percent to 43.505.  To contact the reporters on this story:
