Career Point Infosystems Ltd. , an
education company that tutors students aspiring for a seat in
the Indian Institute of Technology, more than doubled on debut
making it the nation’s best performing IPO in 18 months.  The shares  surged  to 628.15 rupees in Mumbai, that’s the
most since March 2, 2009, when Edserv Softsystems Ltd., an
Indian company that provides online training to job seekers,
advanced 129 percent on debut. Career Point raised 1.15 billion
rupees ($26 million) selling shares at 310 rupees apiece.  Career Point, based in the western Indian city of Kota,
will use the proceeds to build a new campus as faster economic
growth boosts demand for professional education courses. The
country, the world’s second-most populated, will add 136 million
workers, more than the population of Japan, by 2020, according
to Morgan Stanley.  “There’s a huge potential available in India,” Chairman
and Managing Director Pramod Maheshwari said in a phone
interview today. “Coaching business will continue to grow.”  The company also provides training for students attempting
to take exams to qualify for a seat in India’s medical colleges,
according to its website.  Created after India achieved independence from the U.K. in
1947,  IITs  were designed to train leaders for India’s post-war
industrial development.  Graduates from the IITs include  Ajit Jain , who runs one of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s insurance units, Nitin Nohria, dean of
Harvard University’s business school and Arun Sarin, former
chief executive officer of Vodafone Group Plc.  Career Point reported a profit of 178 million rupees on
revenue of 658 million rupees in the year ended March 31,
according to its sale document. Investors demanded 45 times the
shares on offer at the IPO.  Indian companies raised about 102 billion rupees from 30
initial public offers this year. Three companies may raise about
13.9 billion rupees this week as the benchmark  Sensitive Index 
approaches a record high. The Sensex gained 0.7 percent, to
20,543.08 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
