VimpelCom Ltd. chief  Alexander Izosimov  said he’s prepared to discuss the sale of Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE’s Djezzy unit to the Algerian government.  “We’d be happy to keep this company among our assets and
manage these assets, because there’s potential in this market,”
Izosimov told reporters in Algiers today. “But if the
government insists, we’d naturally be prepared to consider
selling this asset to the government.”  Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  said today that
VimpelCom is now a negotiator in Orascom Telecom Holding SAE’s
talks with the Algerian government over the sale of the Djezzy
unit in the North African country.  Plans by VimpelCom, owner of Russia’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, to combine assets with Sawiris’s stake in
Orascom may enable Russia to mediate in a disagreement over
taxes and ownership of Orascom’s Algerian operations, Sawiris
told reporters yesterday in Cairo.  Izosimov said he “hopes” Djezzy will be raised during
Russian leader  Dmitry Medvedev ’s trip to Algeria today, though
he didn’t talk about the issue with the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
