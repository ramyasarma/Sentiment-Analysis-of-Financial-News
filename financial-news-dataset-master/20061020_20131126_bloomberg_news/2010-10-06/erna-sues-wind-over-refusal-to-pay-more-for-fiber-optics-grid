Terna SpA , the owner of Italy’s power
grid, is suing mobile phone operator  Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA 
over its refusal to renew a fiber optics grid contract at a
higher price.  “We need to defend the interests of our shareholders and
enhance our assets,” Terna Chief Executive Officer  Flavio Cattaneo  told reporters in Rome today.  Cattaneo confirmed a  report  in newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore
saying Terna wants to revise the current contract, increasing
the price Wind pays to use the grid by 12 million euros ($17
million). The original contract, which expires in 2019, was
written at below-market prices at a time when Terna and Wind
were both owned by  Enel SpA .  Cattaneo said that the impossibility of reaching an accord
with Wind, which is now owned by  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE ,
makes the intervention “of third parties” necessary.  Wind’s press office didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
