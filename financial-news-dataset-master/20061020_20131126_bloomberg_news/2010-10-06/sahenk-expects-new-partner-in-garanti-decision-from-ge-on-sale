Ferit Sahenk, chairman of Dogus
Holding AS, said he expects a change in partnership in Turkiye
Garanti Bankasi AS, a bank it owns with General Electric Co.  Dogus expects a decision from GE on the sale of its 21
percent stake in Garanti, Sahenk said in a televised interview
with CNBC-e news channel in Berlin today.  Dogus Holding plans an initial public offering next year
after GE completes the sale of the Garanti stake, Sahenk said.  Garanti rose 20 kurus, or 2.4 percent, to 8.45 liras on 
the Istanbul Stock Exchange at 4:10 p.m. That values GE's 
stake at 7.5 billion liras ($5.3 billion.)   To contact the reporter on this story:
