The Performing Arts Center planned
for the World Trade Center site will be supported by a $100
million fund drawn from federal money, according to an
announcement by New York Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg , Governor
 David A. Paterson  and New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver.  “Our collective desire to put $100 million towards the
development of the Performing Arts Center at the World Trade
Center site makes clear that the cultural venue is a critical
part of the ongoing revitalization of Lower Manhattan,” Mayor
Bloomberg said in an e-mailed statement.  Architect  Frank Gehry ’s firm will design the center. The
 Joyce Theater , primarily a venue for modern dance, will be its
main resident. The space will contain a 1,000-seat theater, a
secondary theater, rehearsal spaces, classrooms, a public cafe,
outdoor plazas and administrative space.  Although the foundation of the building has already been
started, principal construction won’t begin for several years.
The building is expected to take three years to complete.  The money for the center is part of the post-9/11 federal
allocation for Manhattan infrastructure. The mayor is founder
and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter of this story:
