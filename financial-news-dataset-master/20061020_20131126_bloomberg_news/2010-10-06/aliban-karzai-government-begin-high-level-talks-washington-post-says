Taliban representatives empowered to
speak for the militant group’s senior leadership and the Afghan
government have begun “high-level talks” for an end to the war,
the Washington Post reported, citing sources it didn’t name.  The talks, which are at a preliminary stage, follow
meetings held in Saudi Arabia more than a year ago, the paper
reported Afghan and Arab sources as saying. Those representing
the Taliban are believed to have been “fully authorized” by
the Quetta Shura, which includes the movement’s leader,  Mohammad Omar , the Post said.  Concerned they are being sidelined by more “radical
elements” within the Taliban rank and file, the leadership has
begun to discuss an agreement that would include some of their
group joining the government of President  Hamid Karzai  and the
withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
