Japanese  stocks  rose, driving the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to a two-month high, with banks leading
gains after the Bank of Japan announced monetary easing measures
yesterday to boost the economy and combat deflation.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-biggest publicly
traded bank, surged 8.6 percent. Lenders recovered after
plunging briefly on concern the financial regulator would raise
capital-adequacy requirements.  Mitsubishi Estate Co.  gained 4.2
percent after the central bank said yesterday it will buy more
assets, which may include real-estate trusts. Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan’s largest commodities trader, rose 2.3 percent after
commodity prices advanced.  “Speculation about monetary easing increased globally,
directing money into the markets,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a
fund manager in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $6 billion in Tokyo.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.8 percent to 9,691.43
in Tokyo, its highest close since Aug. 3. The broader Topix
index gained 1.4 percent to 844.50, with more than twice as many
shares advancing as declining.  The Nikkei 225 has fallen 8.1 percent this year as Europe’s
debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-price inflation and
concern about the pace of the U.S. economic rebound hurt
confidence in a global recovery. That’s the second-biggest drop
among the world’s 10 largest equity markets. Stocks in the gauge
trade at 16.7 times estimated earnings on average, near the
lowest level since October 2008.  Rate Cut  Yesterday, the Bank of Japan cut its overnight call rate
target to a range of zero to 0.1 percent from 0.1 percent and
established a 5-trillion-yen ($60 billion) fund to buy
government bonds and other assets. It acted after the yen’s
surge to a 15-year high last month hurt exports.  The bank said it will use the new fund to buy about 3.5
trillion yen in government debt and the remainder to purchase
assets such as commercial paper, exchange-traded funds and real-
estate investment trusts.  Mitsubishi Estate climbed 4.2 percent to 1,476 yen.  Mitsui
Fudosan Co. , Japan’s No. 1 property developer by sales, rose 3.5
percent to 1,555 yen. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. leapt
5.2 percent to 1,841 yen.  “The Bank of Japan’s action may accelerate movements
towards monetary easing globally,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , general
manager of the equities division at Tokyo-based Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc. “Confidence grew that the global economy is on
a recovery track, and investors will likely put money back into
risk assets.”  Banks Gain  Mizuho soared 8.6 percent to 126 yen and its bigger rival
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. rose 2.6 percent to 401 yen,
the two biggest individual contributors to the gain in the Topix.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the third-biggest lender,
gained 1.8 percent to 2,494 yen. They were the three most
actively traded stocks by value in Japan.  Banks made the biggest  contribution  to the Topix’s advance
among the gauge’s 33 industry groups. In the morning session,
they briefly erased gains after a person with direct knowledge
of the matter said Japan’s Financial Services Agency is
considering forcing the country’s largest banks to hold more
capital than required under Basel III rules. The regulator
denied the plans.  Mitsubishi rose 2.3 percent to 2,022 yen. Mitsui & Co., the
country’s No. 2 trading house by market value, climbed 3.4
percent to 1,332 yen.  Shipping Lines  Crude oil for November delivery increased 1.7 percent
yesterday in New York. The London Metal Exchange Index of six
industrial metals including copper and zinc rose 1.6 percent
yesterday to its highest level since July 2008.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. , Japan’s No. 3 shipping line,
advanced 4 percent to 313 yen, the most since July 14.  Nippon
Yusen K.K. , Japan’s No. 1 shipping line by sales, gained 3
percent to 342 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the operator of
the world’s largest merchant fleet, rose 2.3 percent to 527 yen.
The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for commodities climbed
3.7 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since Aug. 20.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rallied 2.1 percent
yesterday in New York after the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of  non-manufacturing  businesses, which covers
90 percent of the world’s largest economy, increased to 53.2 in
September from 51.5 the previous month. The  median forecast  from
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 52. Readings greater
than 50 signal growth.  Advances by exporters were limited as the yen strengthened.
Japan’s currency appreciated to as much as 83.07 against the
dollar today, compared with 83.81 at the close of stock trading
in Tokyo yesterday, reducing the value of overseas income when
repatriated.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 0.8
percent to 2,952 yen and Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest
automaker, sank 2.4 percent to 731 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest camera maker, fell 0.6 percent to 3,925 yen. Toyota was
the heaviest drag on the Topix followed by Nissan and Canon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
