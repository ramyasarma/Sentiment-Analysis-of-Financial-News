Copper rose to the highest price in
almost 27 months after the dollar extended a slump, boosting the
appeal of commodities as alternative investments.  The  greenback  fell against a basket of major currencies to
the lowest level since January after a private report based on
payrolls showed unexpected job losses in September. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed to the
highest level in almost nine months, led by energy and precious
metals.  “Devaluation of the dollar is going to lead to
inflationary times and decreasing purchasing power,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
broker in Chicago. “This thought process is going to prop up
commodity prices.”  Copper futures for December delivery gained 2.65 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $3.753 a pound at 1:26 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the metal reached $3.7895, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 11, 2008.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $83, or 1 percent, to $8,259 a metric ton ($3.75
a pound).  Tin rose $325, or 1.3 percent, to $26,250 a ton. Earlier,
the price reached a record $26,790. This year, the metal has
gained 55 percent, the most of any metal on the LME, partly
because of production disruptions in Indonesia and Democratic
Republic of Congo.  Nickel, lead and zinc also rose in London. Aluminum fell.  To contact the reporters on the story:
