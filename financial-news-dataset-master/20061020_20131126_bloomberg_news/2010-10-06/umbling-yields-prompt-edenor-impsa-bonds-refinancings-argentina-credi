Argentine companies from Empresa
Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA to Industrias
Metalurgicas Pescarmona SA are taking advantage of the lowest
benchmark  yields  in 29 months to refinance debt.  Edenor, as the country’s biggest power distributor is
known, is offering to exchange 10.5 percent bonds due in 2017
for 9.75 percent notes maturing in 2022 plus cash. IMPSA, a
maker of turbines and generators based in Buenos Aires, used
proceeds from a $275 million sale of 10.375 percent bonds due in
2020 to buy back 11.25 percent notes maturing in 2014.  Yields on Argentine government bonds, the benchmark for
companies, fell to 9.51 percent yesterday from 11.53 percent in
June, when President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner restructured
$12.2 billion of defaulted debt. Demand is increasing for higher-
yielding, emerging-market debt amid record-low interest rates in
Europe, the U.S. and Japan.  “The market is very strong,” said  Jim Harper , director of
corporate research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Connecticut,
in a telephone interview. “For Argentine issuers, the market
hasn’t really been all that open in recent years.”  Debt sold by Argentina is the highest-yielding among
emerging-market countries after Venezuela and Ecuador, according
to JPMorgan’s Chase Co.’s EMBI+ index.  Argentina had the most corporate defaults of any Latin
American country between 1990 and the first half of 2009, with
43 companies missing interest payments on debt with a principal
value of $14.5 billion, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The yield on Buenos Aires-based Edenor’s 10.5 percent bonds
tumbled 234 basis points, or 2.34 percentage points, this year
to 9.25 percent, the lowest since May 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Uncertain’ Profitability  “We plan to place bonds due in 12 years at a coupon that
reflects how financing costs have improved,” Edenor spokesman
 Alberto Lippi  said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Companies are more likely to sell debt to refinance
themselves than to raise fresh funds for infrastructure
projects, said  Cecilia Minguillon , a corporate finance analyst
with Fitch Ratings in Buenos Aires.  The government froze utility rates during the 2001
financial crisis that led to the country’s record $95 billion
debt default.  “For utility companies, profitability is very uncertain,”
Minguillon said in a telephone interview yesterday. “You don’t
know when the government will adjust tariffs, so you obviously
don’t make big investments.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold the government’s
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 21 basis points
yesterday to 647, according to JPMorgan.  Elections  The cost of insuring Argentine bonds against default for
five years fell 16 basis points to 739 yesterday, according to
CMA DataVision. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a government or company fail to comply with debt
agreements.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent yesterday to 3.9577 per
dollar. Warrants linked to economic growth rose 0.1 cent to
12.18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Highway operator Autopistas del Sol SA said Oct.4 that
creditors holding about $294 million in defaulted debt, or 95.7
percent of the total outstanding, participated in a
restructuring it opened in January.  Argentine companies may seek to refinance debt before
presidential elections in October 2011 prompt investors to shun
the country’s bonds, according to BCP’s Harper.  Companies will look to refinance now as the market “is
still open and the elections still seem far away,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
