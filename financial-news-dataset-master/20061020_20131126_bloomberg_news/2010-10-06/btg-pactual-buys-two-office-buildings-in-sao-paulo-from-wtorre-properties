Banco BTG Pactual SA bought two
office towers in Sao Paulo from WTorre Properties SA, as the
bank expands property investments in Brazil’s financial center.  BTG also acquired a 40 percent stake in land in the area on
which WTorre, a Brazilian real estate company, is building an
office tower, according to an official at a public relations
company representing WTorre. The amount of the transactions
weren’t disclosed. BTG didn’t reply to phone requests for
comment.  Banco Santander SA’s Brazilian unit paid 1.06 billion reais
($637 million) to WTorre in June 2008 for a 28-story building
across the street from the two towers acquired by BTG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
