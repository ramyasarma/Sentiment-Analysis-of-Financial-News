The Italian Government will name the
heads of a new regulatory agency this year to oversee the
country’s return to nuclear power, Industry Minister  Paolo Romani  said.  Romani was named to the post this week, which has been
vacant for five months. He has been meeting today in Rome with
some of the heads of Italy’s biggest industrial companies,
including Fulvio Conti, chief executive officer of  Enel SpA ,
which is going to build four of the eight nuclear plants
approved by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
