Saipem SpA was raised to “buy” from
“sell” at Citigroup Inc., which said the company “can
continue its earnings growth through the deployment of new
deepwater drilling rigs and offshore units, as well as the
recovery of onshore markets.”  The brokerage lifted its share-price forecast on Europe’s
largest oilfield-services provider 73 percent to 38 euros.  The shares gained 1.4 percent to 30.54 euros as of 9:26
