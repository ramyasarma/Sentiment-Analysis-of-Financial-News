TiVo Inc.  said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office reaffirmed the validity of a patent for the
Time Warp digital video-recording technology that’s at the
center of a dispute with  Dish Network Corp.  and  EchoStar Corp.   TiVo rose 9.7 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after
the Alviso, California-based company issued a statement on the
ruling today. The agency’s decision, which can’t be appealed,
eliminates one of the ways Dish and EchoStar were trying to
avoid a patent-infringement verdict.  “Today’s decision further validates our IP and brings us
closer to ending EchoStar’s ongoing infringement,” TiVo said.  The patent office review is a parallel proceeding to TiVo’s
legal case over a 2004 lawsuit it won against Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish and EchoStar. A U.S. appeals court is
scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 9 on whether Dish was entitled
to a new trial to determine if an altered version of its digital
video-recorder technology still infringed the patent.  Francie Bauer , a spokeswoman for Dish, said the company had
no immediate comment.  TiVo  rose  89 cents to $10.08 at 4 p.m. New York time for
the biggest percentage gain since March 4. Dish  fell  53 cents to
$19.10. EchoStar  dropped  21 cents to $19.30.  The appeal is TiVo v. EchoStar, 2009-1374, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower-court
case is TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Communications Corp., 04-cv-01,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall).  To contact the reporter on this story:
