Standard Bank Plc sold 800 million
pula ($121 million) of four-year notes linked to the debt of
Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond producer.  The credit-linked note pays a coupon equal to the 91-day
Bank of Botswana certificate rate, currently  7.14 percent , plus
40 basis points in the first three years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In the final year, the payment is based
on Botswana’s 10.25 percent bonds due 2015 plus 70 basis points.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The privately placed securities are the second Botswana-
linked notes issued by Johannesburg-based Standard Bank this
year, Bloomberg data show. Botswana government debt is currently
rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service, the sixth-highest
investment grade, and an equivalent A by Standard & Poor’s.  Standard Bank’s  Angus Robertson , a London-based credit
trader who worked on the transaction, declined to comment.  Credit-linked notes are tied to the creditworthiness of a
company or country. They pay interest based on the income from
credit-default swaps, or from the debt of the borrower they
reference. Default swaps are financial instruments used to bet
on or hedge against a company’s ability to repay debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
