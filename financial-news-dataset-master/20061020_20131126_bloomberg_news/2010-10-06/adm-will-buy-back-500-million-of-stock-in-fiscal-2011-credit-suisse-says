Archer Daniels Midland Co. , the
world’s largest grain processor, will spend $500 million buying
back shares in fiscal 2011, Credit Suisse AG said.  “We continue to be encouraged by management’s constructive
tone toward share repurchase,”  Robert Moskow , a New York-based
analyst at Credit Suisse with an “outperform” rating on the
stock, said in a report today.  Moskow said his prediction for ADM’s buyback is likely to
be “conservative” because he estimates the Decatur, Illinois-
based company has $1.1 billion of cash available. There’s
“strong potential” for an acceleration of repurchases in the
next few months as commodity prices start falling, he said.  The company bought $100 million of shares in the three
months through June 30 and further repurchases are among its
options going forward, Chief Executive Officer  Patricia A. Woertz  said in a conference call with analysts Aug. 3.  Roman Blahoski , an ADM spokesman, declined to comment on
buybacks since July 1, the start of the company’s fiscal year.
Such information is provided on a quarterly basis, he said.  ADM  rose 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $32.41 at 12:42 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 3.4 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
