U.S. corn and soybean production will
be smaller than the government forecast last month and less than
last year’s record harvests, according to forecaster Lanworth
Inc.  Farmers will collect 12.953 billion bushels of corn,
Lanworth said, down from the company’s Sept. 24 forecast of
13.009 billion. That compares with 13.16 billion projected by
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Sept. 10 and last year’s
harvest of 13.11 billion bushels. The average yield will fall to
158.3 bushels, from 164.7 in 2009, Lanworth said.  The soybean harvest will total 3.357 billion bushels, up
from the previous forecast of 3.351 billion, Itasca, Illinois-
based Lanworth said today in a statement. The USDA in September
projected a crop at 3.483 billion bushels, up from a record
3.359 billion last year. Yields will average 43.6 bushels this
year, Lanworth said, down from 44 bushels in 2009.  The USDA will update its forecasts on Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
