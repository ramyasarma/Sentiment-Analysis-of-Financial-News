Eros International Media Ltd. , a
distributor of Hindi movies starring actors such as  Shah Rukh Khan  and  Sanjay Dutt , surged on its trading debut in Mumbai
after investors demanded 25 times the shares on offer.  Eros  advanced  8.1 percent to 189.2 rupees at 1:26 p.m. in
Mumbai after surging as much as 24 percent. The company raised
3.5 billion rupees ($79 million) selling shares at 175 rupees
apiece in an initial public offering last month.  The company, which owns rights for movies including Khan’s
Om Shanti Om, will use the proceeds to acquire films in Hindi
and vernacular languages such as Bengali, Tamil and Gujarati, as
rising salaries in the world’s second-most populated nation
boosts demand for entertainment. The company plans to market 50
new movies each year, according to its sale document.  “There’s a big thirst for regional movies,” Chairman
Kishore Lulla said in Mumbai today.  India’s economy grew 8.8 percent in the quarter ended June
30, the fastest pace in two-and-a-half years. Salaries in India
may grow an average 10.6 percent in 2010, the fastest pace in
the Asia-Pacific, according to Lincolnshire, Illinois-based
human resources adviser Hewitt Associates Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
