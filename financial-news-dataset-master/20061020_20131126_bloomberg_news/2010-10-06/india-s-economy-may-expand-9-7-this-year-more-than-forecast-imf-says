India’s economy may grow faster than
previously forecast, helped by consumer demand, the
International Monetary Fund said.  The South Asian economy will expand 9.7 percent in 2010,
the  Washington-based lender  said in its World Economic Outlook,
more than the 9.4 percent estimated in July. The fund maintained
its 2011 prediction for India’s growth at 8.4 percent.  “Low reliance on exports, accommodative policies, and
strong capital inflows have supported domestic activity and
growth,” the IMF said in the report. “The rapid pace of
domestic activity, evidenced by rapidly rising inflation, led
the central bank to increase the repo policy rate.”  The Reserve Bank of India has increased its benchmark
 repurchase rate  by 1.25 percentage points this year, the most by
any central bank in Asia, to cool price gains. The IMF forecast
Indian consumer prices may rise 13.2 percent in 2010 compared
with 10.9 percent in 2009.  The Reserve Bank’s repurchase rate is 6 percent and the
reverse repurchase rate is 5 percent. The  central bank  is
scheduled to issue its next monetary policy statement on Nov. 2.  Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased
India’s economic growth forecast to 8.5 percent from 8.2 percent
for the financial year ending March 31 and estimated inflation
at 6.5 percent by March 31, more than its earlier projection of
6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
