What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that a dry weather
pattern may hurt crops that farmers are starting to plant in
Brazil and Argentina, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. Soybean-meal futures
may open steady to 50 cents lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open up 0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as dry weather threatens early plant development
in the U.S., and cold temperatures may stunt winter-crop growth
in Russia, Roose said.  -- Corn futures are called to open little changed in Chicago
before the government’s third field-based estimate of U.S.
production on Oct. 8, Roose said. Prices surged 4.1 percent
yesterday on speculation the U.S. Department of Agriculture will
cut its forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
