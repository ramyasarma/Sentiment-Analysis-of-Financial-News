The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive
Index may rise to 22,000 by the yearend, a “tactial” target
based on the outlook for foreign fund flows, according to BNP
Paribas.  The brokerage remains “underweight” on Indian equities
over a 12-month period, analysts led by Clive McDonnell said in
a report today, citing the market’s valuations, earnings,
domestic flows and share sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
