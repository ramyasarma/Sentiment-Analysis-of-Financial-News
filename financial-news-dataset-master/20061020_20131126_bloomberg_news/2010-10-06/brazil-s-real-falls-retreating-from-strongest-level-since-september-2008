Brazil’s real lost 0.1 percent to
1.6646 per U.S. dollar at 8:03 a.m. New York time. The currency
surged to its strongest level in two years yesterday as Japan’s
interest rate cut overwhelmed efforts by President Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva to weaken the real by taxing foreign purchases of
bonds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
