Brazil’s Treasury won authorization
to step up dollar purchases for debt payments as the government
increases efforts to temper the real’s rally.  The National Monetary Council gave the Treasury permission
to buy foreign currency for  external debt  payments as much as
1,500 days ahead of maturity, up from a previous 750 days,
according to statement posted on the central bank’s information
system, known as Sisbacen. As of August, Brazil had 30.5 billion
reais ($18.2 billion) in external debt due in the next 48 months
compared with 17.5 billion reais due in the next two years,
Treasury figures show.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  this week doubled a tax on
foreign purchases of fixed-income securities in a bid to temper
currency gains that pushed the real to two-year high yesterday.
The real is up 38 percent since 2008, the third-best performance
after the Australian Dollar and South African Rand among the 16
most traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Today’s limit revision is the second time this year that
the government has increased the horizon on dollar purchases the
Treasury could carry out for debt payment. On March 24, the
limit was extended to 750 days from 360 days.  The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.6722 per dollar at 11:52
a.m. New York time from 1.6632 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
