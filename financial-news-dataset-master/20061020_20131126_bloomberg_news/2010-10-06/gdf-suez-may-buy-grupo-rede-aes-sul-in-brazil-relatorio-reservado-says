GDF Suez SA  plans to make at least
three acquisitions in the next few months to enter the Brazilian
energy distribution industry,  Relatorio Reservado  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  GDF Suez’s priority is to buy Grupo Rede, which would give
it nine distributors in seven Brazilian states, almost 5 million
consumers and sales of about 8 billion reais ($4.8 billion), the
Rio de Janeiro-based newsletter said.  GDF Suez is also in talks to buy AES Sul Distribuidora
Gaucha de Energia SA through its Tractebel Energia SA unit,
Relatorio Reservado said. GDF Suez has also started talks with
the government of Santa Catarina state and pension fund Previ to
buy the fund’s stake in Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina SA,
the newsletter said.  Officials at GDF Suez in Paris didn’t immediately respond
to a call and e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
