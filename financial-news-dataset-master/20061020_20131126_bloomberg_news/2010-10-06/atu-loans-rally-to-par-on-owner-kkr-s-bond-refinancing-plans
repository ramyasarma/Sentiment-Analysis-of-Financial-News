Loans used to fund ATU Auto-Teile-
Unger Group’s leveraged buyout rallied on owner KKR & Co.’s plan
to retire the debt with the proceeds of a 450 million-euro ($624
million) sale of high-yield bonds.  The German car parts chain’s senior loans were quoted at 98
percent to 100 percent of face value today, compared with 91
percent on Sept. 23 before the company announced the bond sale,
according to Commerzbank Bank AG secondary market prices. The
loans traded at 28 percent of par at the start of 2009,
information provider Markit Group Ltd. data show.  ATU is selling 375 million euros of four-year notes at a
yield of 11.25 percent to 11.5 percent, a banker involved in the
deal said today. Weiden-based ATU is also raising 75 million
euros from floating-rate notes that may pay as much as 10
percentage points more than interbank lending rates, said the
banker, who declined to be identified before terms are set.  ATU’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 53 percent to 2.3 million euros in the three
months ended Aug. 31 from a year ago, the company  said  Sept. 24.  ATU missed performance targets in 2007, prompting KKR to
hire Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise on a restructuring. New
York-based KKR bought ATU in 2004, paying 1.45 billion euros for
an 80 percent stake. KKR increased its holding to 99.4 percent
in February this year.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing
the bond sale, the banker said.  HVB Group and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. arranged the 1.28
billion-euro LBO financing in 2004, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  In an LBO, a buyer funds its acquisition with money
borrowed in the target company’s name. High-yield, or leveraged,
debt is graded below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB-
by Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
