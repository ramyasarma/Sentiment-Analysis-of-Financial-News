Robbins & Myers Inc. , the industrial-
equipment maker with operations in 15 countries, agreed to buy
T-3 Energy Services Inc. for about $422 million to boost sales
to oil companies.  Owners of Houston-based T-3 will receive 0.894 share of
Robbins & Myers and $7.95 in cash for each of their shares, the
companies said today in a statement. The deal values T-3 at
about $31.80 a share, 17 percent higher than its closing price
yesterday, according to a calculation by Bloomberg.  Excluding one-time transaction costs, the purchase will
start increasing earnings for Dayton, Ohio-based Robbins & Myers
in the company’s first full year of owning T-3, according to the
statement. The companies said combining operations will yield
about $9 million in annual cost savings.  T-3  provides services and parts for oilfield equipment,
including blowout preventers used on offshore rigs. The
companies have “very little overlap” in their product and
service offerings, Robbins & Myers Chief Executive Officer  Peter Wallace  said in the statement.  T-3 jumped $4.33, or 16 percent, to $31.48 at 10:17 a.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Robbins & Myers 
climbed 12 cents to $26.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
