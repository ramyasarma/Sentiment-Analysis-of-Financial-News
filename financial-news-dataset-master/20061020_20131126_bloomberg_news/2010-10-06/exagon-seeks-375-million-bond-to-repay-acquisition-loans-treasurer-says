Hexagon AB, the world’s biggest maker
of measuring instruments, plans to sell bonds to refinance part
of the loans used to fund the acquisition of U.S. software
provider Intergraph Corp.  “Our plan is to issue bonds with tenors somewhere between
three and seven years,” Robert Belkic, group treasurer at the
Stockholm-based company said today in a telephone interview.  Hexagon’s lenders closed senior syndication of $2.13
billion of term loans today, including a $375 million bond
bridge facility. The timing of the bond issue will “depend on
market conditions,” Belkic said.  The bond bridge is available for a year and can be extended
by another year, underwriters Credit Agricole CIB and SEB AB
said today in a statement. Hexagon also got 750 million euros of
five-year revolving credit and a 250 million-euro five-year term
loan to refinance debt signed in June 2006.  The company plans to raise $850 million from a share sale
to help refinance some of the debt after it completes the
purchase. Hexagon said on July 7 it agreed to buy Huntsville,
Alabama-based Intergraph for $2.13 billion to add software that
helps companies visualize complex data and design factories,
ships and oil rigs.  Commerzbank AG, Danske Bank, DnB NOR Bank ASA, Svenska
Handelsbanken AB, ING Groep NV, Nordea Bank AB, Swedbank AB, and
BNP Paribas SA have joined the loans, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
