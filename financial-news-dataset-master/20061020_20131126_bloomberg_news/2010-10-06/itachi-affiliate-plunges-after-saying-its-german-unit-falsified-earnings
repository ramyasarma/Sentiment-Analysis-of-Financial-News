Hitachi Koki Co. , a Japanese maker of
electric tools, fell the most in almost 19 months in Tokyo
trading after saying a German subsidiary falsified earnings.  Hitachi Koki  dropped as much as 7.5 percent to 682 yen and
traded at 691 yen as of the 11 a.m. trading break in Tokyo.
Shares of parent  Hitachi Ltd.  declined 0.3 percent while the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.3 percent.  An internal audit at Hitachi Power Tools Europe GmbH
revealed that the company falsified earnings to cover up for
excessive business investments in the period between December
2005 and August 2010, Hitachi Koki said in a statement yesterday.
The unit overstated sales by about 10 billion yen ($120 million)
and operating and net income by 4 billion yen, it said.  “The final impact on earnings is unlikely to be
significant, but the shares will continue to struggle,” said
 Takao Hattori , an analyst at Tokyo-based Toward the Infinite
World Inc., who has a “neutral”  rating  on the stock.  An initial audit into increasing debt and lengthening
collection periods for accounts receivable in August uncovered
improper dealings and implicated the president of the subsidiary,
the company said. The follow-up investigation showed the unit
colluded with some clients to understate liabilities by
recording revenue in one fiscal year and buying back in the
following accounting period, it said.  Hitachi Koki, based in Tokyo, said it dismissed the unit’s
president on Oct. 4. Hitachi Koki’s Chief Information Officer
Toru Inoue declined to name the former unit president at a
briefing in Tokyo yesterday.  The company said it will determine the impact on earnings
by Nov. 15, ahead of the announcement of fiscal second-quarter
results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
