Total SA, OAO Gazprom and Tecpetrol
SA plan to start output at the Ipati and Aquio blocks in Bolivia
in 2013, the Russian gas producer said.  Total holds 60 percent of the project, while Gazprom has 20
percent, after signing an agreement on Sept. 30 to change the
ownership structure, the Moscow-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. Tecpetrol has the remaining 20 percent.  Gazprom and Total are close to completing talks with
Bolivia’s state-owned YPF Bolivianos on the Azero block, Gazprom
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
