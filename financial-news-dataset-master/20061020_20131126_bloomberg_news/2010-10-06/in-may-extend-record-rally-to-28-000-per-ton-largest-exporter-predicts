Tin may rally to a record $28,000 a
metric ton because the rainfall that disrupted output this year
in Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter, will extend into
2011, according to a government official.  The advance will boost earnings for producers and increase
royalty payments to the government, said Witoro Soelarno,
secretary to the director-general of minerals, coal and
geothermal at the energy ministry.  PT Timah , based in
Pangkalpinang, is Indonesia’s biggest producer. The metal traded
at a record $26,790 on the London Metal Exchange today.  Tin is the best performer this year among the six main
metals traded on the LME, climbing 56 percent on concern that
supply disruptions in Indonesia and China will cut stockpiles.
 Venture Minerals  Ltd., building a mine in Tasmania, has said
that global shortages may last five years. Barclays Capital is
predicting a 15,000-ton supply shortage next year, the biggest
since at least 2003.  “Tin prices will continue to climb as the bad weather,
that disrupted production, will persist until next year,”
Soelarno told reporters in Jakarta today. Soelarno said on Aug.
11 that Indonesia’s output of the metal may drop about 20
percent this year to 85,000 tons because of heavy rains.  Tin, used as a solder and in packaging, has rallied from a
low of $9,700 in December 2008. The metal for delivery in three
months rose as much as 3.3 percent on the LME today.  La Nina  A La Nina weather event has brought heavier-than-usual
rainfall to parts of Australia and Asia this year, including
Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The rains have also
been blamed by industry groups in the country for lower output
or missed forecasts for cocoa, palm oil and coal.  “The situation on some metal markets such as tin is
tightening considerably,”  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in a report. “Besides
enormous production problems in Indonesia and also in China
lately, we are also seeing stronger stock reductions.”  Tin stockpiles  tracked by the LME dropped 53 percent this
year, falling to a 17-month low of 12,495 tons on Oct. 1.
Exports from Indonesia declined for the first eight months of
this year to 60,107 tons from 67,798 tons a year earlier, the
Trade Ministry said Sept. 22.  Tin output from China may be restricted until the end of
the year because of limitations on power use, industry group
ITRI Ltd. said Sept. 29. A general ban on mining was also
imposed last month in three eastern provinces in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Africa’s largest producer.  Timah Surges  Tin production will expand 1.5 percent to 334,000 tons next
year, while demand will jump 2 percent to 350,000 tons, Barclays
said in a Sept. 16 report.  “The catch-up that’s required on the exploration side is
quite vast,” Venture Minerals Managing Director  Hamish Halliday 
said yesterday in an interview.  Shares in  PT Timah  surged as much as 5.7 percent to 3,275
rupiah today before ending at 3,200 rupiah. The stock has jumped
60 percent this year, beating the 42 percent gain in the
benchmark Jakarta Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
