Costco Wholesale Corp. , the largest
U.S. warehouse-club chain, reported a 16 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit as sales overseas surged.  Net income  climbed to $432 million, or 97 cents a share, in
the period ended Aug. 29, from $374 million, or 85 cents, a year
earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said in a
statement today. Analysts  projected  95 cents a share, the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Costco  increased customer traffic as consumers and small
businesses sought discounts and bulk purchases during and after
the recession. The chain’s shoppers pay an annual fee for
discounts on groceries and other basics, as well as on pricier
goods such as designer handbags and home furnishings.  Sales at stores open at least a year climbed 8 percent
internationally in the period, excluding foreign-exchange
fluctuations and gasoline. Costco operates stores across the
U.K., Korea, Mexico and Japan.  Costco rose 75 cents to $65.41 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Costco has gained 11 percent this
year, while competitor  BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc.  has climbed 27
percent. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, has
advanced 2.1 percent.  Total revenue rose to $24.1 billion in the fiscal fourth
quarter, Costco said. Analysts anticipated $24.2 billion, the
 average  of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
