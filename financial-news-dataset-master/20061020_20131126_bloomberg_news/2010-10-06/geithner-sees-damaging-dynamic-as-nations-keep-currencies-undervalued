Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said a “damaging dynamic” of large economies keeping
their currencies undervalued can cause quicker inflation and
asset bubbles, and restrict growth.  “More and more countries face stronger pressure to lean
against the market forces pushing up the value of their
currencies,” Geithner said in remarks prepared for a speech at
the Brookings Institution in Washington today. “The collective
impact of this behavior risks either causing inflation and asset
bubbles in emerging economies, or else depressing consumption
growth and intensifying short-term distortions in favor of
exports.”  Global exchange-rate policies are a source of contention
ahead of this week’s meeting in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Group of 20 officials. Brazil’s
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  last week warned of a “currency
war.”  “It is very important to see more progress by the major
emerging economies to more flexible, more market-oriented
exchange-rate systems,” Geithner said. “This is particularly
important for those countries whose currencies are significantly
undervalued.”  Geithner said the “greatest risk to the world economy
today is that the largest economies underachieve on growth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
