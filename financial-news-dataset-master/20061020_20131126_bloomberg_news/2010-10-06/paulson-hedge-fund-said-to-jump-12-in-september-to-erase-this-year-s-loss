John Paulson , who became a
billionaire by betting against U.S. mortgage markets, gained
12.4 percent with his main hedge fund in September to erase this
year’s loss, said two people briefed on the performance.  Returns at New York-based Paulson & Co.’s Advantage Plus
Fund, which uses strategies designed to profit from corporate
events such as mergers or bankruptcies, improved as the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index posted its biggest  rally  for the month since
World War II. Advantage Plus fell 4.3 percent in August before
beating the S&P 500’s 8.8 percent increase last month.  Paulson’s Credit Opportunities Fund rose 3.9 percent in
September, bringing its year-to-date return to 9.6 percent,
according to the people, who asked not to be named because the
information isn’t public. The Recovery Fund advanced 8.5 percent
last month and 7.5 percent this year, while the Gold Fund jumped
5.7 percent in September and 22 percent this year.  Paulson & Co., which oversees about $31 billion, had bet on
an economic recovery by 2012 before scaling back its bullish
investments in securities earlier this year. Paulson, 54, said
he believes the global recovery remains intact, and that he
expects to make money in the next two years with the stocks of
companies going through bankruptcies, restructurings and
reorganizations.  Hedge funds probably recorded their highest return of the
year in September, Credit Suisse Group AG said Oct. 4, as
equities rallied the most for the month since 1939. The  Credit
Suisse Liquid Alternative Beta Index , which tries to replicate
hedge funds’ returns, climbed 3.6 percent in September, the
largest increase since a 3.1 percent gain in July, when the S&P
500 rose 6.9 percent.  Stocks worldwide have  pared  declines to a loss of about 3
percent from the 2010 high reached in mid-April. U.S. growth
slowed to a 1.7 percent pace in the second quarter from 3.7
percent in the first quarter, according to revised data released
Sept. 30.  Paulson’s September returns were reported by the Wall
Street Journal on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
