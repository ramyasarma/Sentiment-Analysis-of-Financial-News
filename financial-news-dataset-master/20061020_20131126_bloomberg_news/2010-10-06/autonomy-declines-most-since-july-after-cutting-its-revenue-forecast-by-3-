Autonomy Corp. , the U.K.’s second-
largest software company, fell the most in eight years in London
trading after lowering its forecast for full-year sales growth.  Full-year revenue will be 3 percent lower than the current
consensus, equating to growth of about 17 percent compared with
a year earlier, the Cambridge, England-based company said in a
statement today. Autonomy dropped 16 percent, the biggest
decline since October 2002.  Autonomy is “noticing customers still showing volatility
around their view of the current macro-economic situation,” so
the company is taking “a prudent approach to forecasting”
following its “seasonally weakest” quarter, Chief Executive
Officer  Mike Lynch  said in the statement.  Autonomy fell 301 pence to close at 1,551 pence as of 4:30
p.m. Before today the shares had gained 23 percent this year.  “The ramp-up of new product cycles, which are more
discretionary, as well as a generally challenging operating
environment increase risks around quarter-end,” analysts at
Goldman Sachs including  Mohammed Moawalla  said today in a note
to clients. Goldman Sachs today removed Autonomy from its
“Conviction Buy” list.  Autonomy said in July that corporate and government clients
remained “cautious” on spending, and new contracts with other
technology equipment makers had declined.  “Mike is perhaps running a bit shy,” said  George O’Connor , an analyst at Panmure Gordon. “The end of the fourth
quarter is a long way off and software is typically sold at the
end of the period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
