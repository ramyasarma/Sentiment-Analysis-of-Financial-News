Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  rose
for a second day, gaining 58.29, or 0.3 percent, to 20,568.31 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Geox SpA  (GEO IM) surged 3.1 percent to 4.17 euros as
shares of the Italian shoemaker that patented ventilated soles
rose above their 20-day moving average.  Impregilo SpA  (IPG IM), Italy’s biggest builder, declined
2.6 percent to 2.16 euros, a second loss this week. Mediobanca
Securities lowered its estimates on 2010 earnings before
interest and taxes as well as earnings-per-share by 22 percent
and 26 percent, respectively.  The brokerage expects Impregilo’s Fisia unit to post more
losses by the end of the year and said in a note that “the
backlog of Fisia is basically close to zero and two main
desalinization plants have to be finalized by the end of the
year/beginning of 2011.”  Interpump Group SpA  (IP IM) surged 5.6 percent to 5.03
euros, extending gains of 4.2 percent yesterday. Gruppo Banca
Leonardo upgraded the world’s biggest maker of high-performance
pumps to “buy” from “underweight.”  Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, gained for a second day, rising 1.5 percent to 13.94
euros as copper rose in London to the highest price in almost 27
months.  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) climbed 3.8 percent to 31.26 euros, the
steepest increase in three months, as Europe’s largest oilfield-
services provider was raised to “buy” from “sell” at
Citigroup Inc. The bank said the company “can continue its
earnings growth through the deployment of new deepwater drilling
rigs and offshore units, as well as the recovery of onshore
markets.”  STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM), Europe’s biggest chipmaker,
fell 1.5 percent to 5.44 euros, paring a 3.5 percent gain
yesterday, as technology shares were the worst performers in
Europe, led by Autonomy Corp. after the U.K.’s second-largest
software company cut its forecast for full-year revenue growth.  Tiscali SpA  (TIS IM) advanced 7.5 percent to 10.88 euro
cents, the biggest gain since October last year. The company
said in a statement that it’s discussing an agreement with ZTE
