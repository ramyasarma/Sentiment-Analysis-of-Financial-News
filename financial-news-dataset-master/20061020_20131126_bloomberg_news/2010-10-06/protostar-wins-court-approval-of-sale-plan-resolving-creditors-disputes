ProtoStar Ltd., a bankrupt former
satellite operator that provided digital television and
broadband Internet in Asia, won court approval of a liquidation
plan that resolves disputes among creditors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Mary Walrath  said today that she will
approve the plan, which would give creditors about
$400 million from the sale of ProtoStar’s two satellites. In
return for some of the proceeds, unsecured creditors will drop a
lawsuit challenging a lender’s secured claims to the assets.  “The plan and global settlement are overwhelmingly
supported by all creditors,” Matthew S. Barr, a lawyer for
ProtoStar, told Walrath in court in Wilmington, Delaware.  ProtoStar, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, sold its ProtoStar I
Ltd. assets to a unit of Intelsat Holdings Ltd. for
$210 million in cash in December, court papers show. In May,
ProtoStar completed the $185 million sale of ProtoStar II Ltd.’s
assets to an affiliate of  SES SA , the world’s largest publicly
traded satellite operator.  The secured lender, an affiliate of  Credit Suisse Group AG 
owed about $246 million, will get most of the proceeds from the
ProtoStar II sale, recovering about 66 cents on the dollar,
according to court papers. Noteholders owed about
$200 million will get most of the ProtoStar I proceeds,
recouping about 83 percent of their claims.  Unsecured Creditors  Unsecured creditors of the ProtoStar I unit, owed
$9.3 million, will recover about 64 cents on the dollar, court
papers show. ProtoStar II’s unsecured creditors, owed
$14.4 million, will recoup about 28 percent. ProtoStar’s
unsecured creditors with claims of $5.7 million will get a
recovery of 2 percent to 9 percent.  ProtoStar listed assets of $528 million and debts of
$463 million, including units not in bankruptcy, as of Dec. 31,
2008. The company filed for bankruptcy after the  Intersputnik
International Organization of Space Communications  terminated
ProtoStar I’s right to its orbital slot, saying it was causing
interference with a nearby satellite, Chief Financial Officer
 Cynthia Pelini  said in court papers.  The case is In re ProtoStar Ltd., 09-12659, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
