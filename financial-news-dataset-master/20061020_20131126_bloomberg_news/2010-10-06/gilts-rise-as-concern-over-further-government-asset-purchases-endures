U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
the 10-year gilt yield down for the second day this week, before
the Bank of England meets to consider whether to restart bond
purchases to boost economic growth.  The Monetary Policy Committee of the central bank meets
tomorrow. Policy maker  Adam Posen  last week advocated further
asset purchases, or quantitative easing, saying monetary policy
“should continue to be aggressive about promoting recovery.”
He has since been backed by the British Chambers of Commerce and
the Institute of Directors. Policy maker  Andrew Sentance  has
voted to raise interest rates since June.  “Gilts will continue to climb as overwhelmingly the market
is bracing for lower growth and more easing in the U.K.,
particularly after the speech by MPC member Adam Posen last
week,” said  Matteo Regesta , an interest-rate strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in London. “At the moment, we would rule out easing
in this year. The earliest risk of it happening would be first
quarter next year.”  The 10-year yield fell 5 basis points to 2.91 percent as of
11:36 a.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security maturing March
2020 increased 0.45, or 4.5 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,584) face
amount, to 115.02. The two-year yield fell 4 basis points to
0.62 percent.  Gilts have gained 9.7 percent since the end of 2009,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit. German government bonds earned 9.2 percent, while
U.S. Treasuries returned 9.1 percent, the indexes.  Asset Purchases  The Institute of Directors, a London-based lobby group,
said the “time has now come” for the MPC to increase asset
purchases by 50 billion pounds ($79 billion) to 250 billion
pounds, in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The median forecast
of 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey is for no change.  The group’s stance aligns it with the British Chambers of
Commerce, whose chief economist,  David Kern , said in a Sept. 30
interview that further stimulus was needed to boost growth.  The pound today depreciated versus 15 of its 16 most traded
peers ahead of the MPC’s decision whether to resume asset
purchases after keeping its bond-buying program at 200 billion
pounds for the past 11 months.  It fell as much as 0.3 percent to 87.2 pence per euro and
was little changed against the dollar at $1.5887. Sterling has
lost 4.7 percent this year against its developed-countries
peers, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes.  “Sterling has been left in a pretty poor place, as the
debate in the U.K. is focused on more quantitative easing,”
said  Steve Barrow , London-based head of Group of 10 foreign-
exchange research at Standard Bank. “The market is not going to
respond well to that, and the euro is going to stay pretty
firm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
