Bain Capital LLC is the front runner
to acquire Priory Group Ltd., the U.K. operator of mental-health
and addiction clinics being sold by  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc , said three people with knowledge of the matter.  RBS is giving Bain time to complete terms of its offer
after talks with other private-equity firms including Cinven
Ltd., Advent International Corp. and  Blackstone Group LP  didn’t
result in an agreement, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private. Priory attracted
offers of less than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), though
Edinburgh-based RBS had been seeking about 1.1 billion pounds,
said one of the people.  Piers Townsend , a spokesman for RBS in London, declined to
comment. An official from Boston-based Bain couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment.  RBS took over Priory, which has treated celebrities
including supermodel  Kate Moss  and singer  Amy Winehouse , from
ABN Amro Holding NV when it bought the Dutch bank in 2007.  RBS 
is selling assets including bank branches and its credit card
payment processing unit after taking 45.5 billion pounds of U.K.
government funding during the global financial crisis, more than
any other bank in the world.  ABN Amro purchased the mental health care provider in 2005
from London private-equity firm Doughty Hanson & Co. for about
875 million pounds. Doughty had purchased the company in 2002
for 306 million pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
