             China 's government has named the
head of the country's sixth-largest bank and a senior civil
servant to a committee that advises the central bank on setting
monetary policies.  
 Bank of Communications' Chairman Jiang Chaoliang and the
State Council Deputy Secretary-General Zhang Ping have been named
to the committee, according to a statement today on the Web site
of the People's Bank of China. The appointments were part of a
routine rotation, the central bank said.  
 Jiang, 49, takes the seat on the 13-member policy committee
previously occupied by China Construction Bank Corp. Chairman Guo Shuqing. Zhang, 61, replaces former State Council Deputy
Secretary-General You Quan after You was picked to head the State
Electricity Regulatory Commission.  
 Jiang in February was appointed to head the China Banking
Association, replacing Guo, said the industry guild's spokesman
Li Yiqi. The association `` always has one seat there to
represent the banking industry,'' Li said by phone.  
 Zhang Ping was promoted to the State Council, China's
cabinet, in January 2006 from the National Development and Reform
Commission, the country's top planning agency. He worked at a
county-level branch of the central bank in east China's Anhui
Province in the 1960s and 1970s.  
 Jiang worked as assistant central bank governor from June,
2000 to September, 2002. Bocom, as Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications is also called, is 19.9 percent owned by HSBC
Holdings Plc. The bank reported a 33 percent surge in 2006 profit.
