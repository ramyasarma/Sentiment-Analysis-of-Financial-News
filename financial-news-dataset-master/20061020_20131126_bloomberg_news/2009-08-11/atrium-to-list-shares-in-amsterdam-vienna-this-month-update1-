             Atrium European Real Estate Ltd. (ATRS) ,
the second-largest Austrian property developer by market value,
expects to list its shares on Euronext in Amsterdam later this
month.  
 Atrium will list 227.2 million shares on Euronext and on
the Vienna exchange from Aug. 19, according to the prospectus
published on its  Web site . About 211 million Atrium depository
certificates already trade in Vienna and they will be swapped
for shares on or near the listing date, the company said.  
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Gazit-Globe Ltd., an Israeli developer,
took control of Atrium, previously known as Meinl European Land
Ltd., a year ago. Since then, Atrium has cut back its
developments in central and eastern Europe and put on hold plans
to sell malls because of the decline in property values.  
 “A second listing on a major international exchange was
one of the key targets we set when we took over the management
of Atrium,” Chief Executive Officer Rachel Lavine said in the
statement.  
 Atrium gained 3 cents to 3.82 euros at 9:22 a.m. in Vienna,
giving the developer a market value of 868 million euros ($1.2
billion). The  shares  closed at 3.79 euros yesterday, the highest
price in nine months. Atrium is registered in  Jersey .
