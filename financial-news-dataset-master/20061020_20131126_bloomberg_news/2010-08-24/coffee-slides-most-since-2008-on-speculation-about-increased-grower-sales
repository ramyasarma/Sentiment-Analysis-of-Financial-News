             Coffee declined the most in more
than two years as a bigger-than-expected plunge in U.S. home
sales stoked concern the economy may relapse into a recession,
eroding demand for commodities.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell for a fourth day as
global equity markets sank. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 raw materials  plunged  the most since June 29, led by the drop
in coffee. Before today, the commodity surged 50 percent in New
York during the past year and yesterday touched the highest
price in almost 13 years.  
 “There is long liquidation after the market rose to a new
high,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial
Markets in Chicago. “The weakness in the equity markets is also
adding selling pressure.”  
 Arabica coffee for December delivery slumped 14.8 cents, or
8.1 percent, to settle at $1.6845 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since
March 17, 2008. Yesterday, the commodity reached $1.8865, the
highest level since Sept. 11, 1997, on concern that demand will
outpace production.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, robusta-coffee futures for
November delivery retreated $137, or 7.7 percent, to settle at
$1,640 a metric ton, the biggest drop since at least January
2008.  
 Today’s settlement at a lower price one day after reaching
a high is a “very negative signal,” according to  Doug Whitehead , an analyst at Rabobank International in London.  
 “With such a weak technical signal, you would think that
would prompt additional selling, as producers and traders might
find prices could head lower for the next few days,” Whitehead
said.  
 Sales of  existing houses  plunged by a record 27 percent in
July to a 3.83 million annual pace, the lowest in a decade of
record keeping, the National Association of Realtors showed
today in Washington. Demand for single-family houses dropped to
a 15-year low and the number of homes on the market swelled.  
 The decline was worse than the most pessimistic forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News as the effects of a
government tax credit waned, showing a lack of jobs threatens to
undermine the U.S. economic recovery.  
 The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped as much as 1.8
percent and the S&P 500 Index fell as much as 1.9 percent.
