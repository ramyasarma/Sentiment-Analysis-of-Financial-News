A former  HannStar Display Corp. 
executive will plead guilty to price-fixing of liquid crystal
display panels and agree to serve seven months in jail, U.S.
prosecutors said in a statement.  Jui Hung Wu  was charged in San Francisco with conspiring
from September 2001 to January 2006 to eliminate competition in
the display industry, the Justice Department said. Wu is a
resident of Taiwan and a former director of  global sales  and
marketing for Taipei-based  HannStar .  Under an agreement, which needs court approval, Wu will pay
a $20,000 fine, according to the government. Wu met with other
executives in the flat-screen industry and agreed to charge
prices at predetermined levels, the U.S. said.  An industrywide probe has led to more than $890 million in
fines, guilty pleas by seven companies and jail terms for nine
executives, the government said.  AU Optronics Corp. , Taiwan’s second-largest flat-screen
maker, and six executives were indicted in the U.S. in June and
accused of conspiring to fix prices of LCDs used in televisions
and computer monitors.  Wu’s lawyer Gail Shifman didn’t immediately return a call
for comment.  The case is U.S. v Wu, 10-00781, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
