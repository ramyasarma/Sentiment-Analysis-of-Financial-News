             Investors should buy Indonesia’s
rupiah, Malaysia’s ringgit and the Philippine peso as relatively
high yields attract inflows into the nations’ bond markets, HSBC
Holdings Plc said.  
 The three currencies may strengthen by between 2 percent
and 5.5 percent by the end of this year, according to research
report published this week by Europe’s largest bank by market
value. It also recommended clients avoid Taiwan’s dollar and
South Korea’s won as their monetary authorities are “strongly
biased” toward a weaker currency to support exports amid signs
the global economy is slowing.  
 The ringgit has led gains among Asia’s most-traded
currencies this year and rupiah-denominated bonds are the
biggest gainers among 10 regional indexes tracked by HSBC as
global funds seek to benefit from the region’s higher benchmark
interest rates. Borrowing costs range from 2.75 percent to 6.5
percent in Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, compared
with a maximum of 0.5 percent in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.  
 “Bond reallocations into Asia will persist,” according to
HSBC’s research report written by analysts including  Richard Yetsenga , the Hong Kong-based global head of emerging markets
currency strategy. “We continue to favor the bond-flow
currencies rather than becoming indiscriminately bullish on
Asian currencies. We expect the volatility around these
currencies to be lower.”  
 Reserves Accumulation  
 The ringgit has gained 9 percent so far this year, the
rupiah 4.6 percent and the peso 1.6 percent. The won has slid
2.8 percent, the worst performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded
currencies, while Taiwan’s dollar is little changed.  
 HSBC predicts the ringgit will gain 3 percent to trade at
3.05 per dollar by the end of 2010, the rupiah 2 percent to
8,800 and the peso 5.5 percent to 43. The ringgit was trading at
3.142 as of 10:26 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, while the rupiah was at
8,979 and the peso at 45.353.  
 Accumulation of foreign-currency reserves to counter
appreciation is “greatest” in Taiwan’s dollar and the won,
HSBC said. South Korea added $11.6 billion to its reserves in
July, while Taiwan bought $4 billion, the bank estimated.  
 Foreign investors raised their holdings of Malaysia’s
government bonds by 18 billion ringgit ($5.7 billion) to a
record 59 billion ringgit this year through June, central bank
data show, compared with net purchases of 12 billion ringgit in
all of 2009.  
 Rupiah-denominated bonds have returned 17.3 percent this
year, according to HSBC. Overseas holdings of Indonesia’s
government bonds were 177.2 trillion rupiah ($19.7 billion) as
of Aug. 16, an increase of 64 percent from the end of 2009,
according to the finance ministry’s website.
