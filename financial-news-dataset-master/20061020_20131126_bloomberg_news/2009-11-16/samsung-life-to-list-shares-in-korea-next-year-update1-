             Samsung Life (032830)  Insurance Co.,  South
Korea ’s biggest life insurer, plans to list shares on the
nation’s main bourse next year.  
 Samsung Life aims to select arrangers next month to proceed
with an initial public offering, Cho Tae Hyun, a spokesman at
the Seoul-based insurer, said by phone in response to an Edaily
report.  
 The offering will help “improve our capital strength and
support efforts to expand our presence overseas,” Cho said.  
 Samsung Life and Korea Life Insurance Co., the nation’s
second-biggest insurer, want to become publicly traded after
Tong Yang Life Insurance Co. raised 340 billion won ($295
million) in September in the country’s first IPO by a life
insurer. The financial regulator in April 2007 gave approval to
life insurers to list their shares on the exchange.  
 Samsung Life reported a 113 billion won profit in the year
ended March 31, compared with 714.6 billion won a year earlier,
according to a  filing  to the exchange in June. The company’s
shareholders included Samsung Everland Co., Samsung Electro-
Mechanics Co. and Cheil Worldiwde Inc., according to the filing.
