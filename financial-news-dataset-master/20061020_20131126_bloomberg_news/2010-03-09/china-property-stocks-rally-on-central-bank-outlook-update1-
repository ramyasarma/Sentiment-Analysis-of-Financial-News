             China’s  property stocks  rose the
most in four months, led by  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  and Poly Real Estate
Group Co., after a deputy central bank governor said there’s no
need yet for further measures to cool the real-estate market.  
 Gemdale gained 5.8 percent to 13.62  yuan  at 1:09 p.m. local
time in  Shanghai . Poly Real Estate jumped 4.9 percent to 20.39
yuan. The Shanghai Composite Index’s property gauge added 3
percent, the biggest advance among the five industry groups and
the most since Nov. 2.  
 Su Ning, a deputy governor of the Chinese central bank,
said that government measures to cool the  property market  have
had an effect, with transactions falling and some prices no
longer climbing. There’s no need yet for any further measures,
Su said at a briefing in Beijing yesterday.  
 “This means there’ll be no negative news for the market,”
Zhang Chifei, analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said in a phone
interview today.  
 China’s property stocks will rise by as much as 15 percent
from current levels as there were no “negative surprises” on
real-estate industry policy from the nation’s legislature,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report today.  
 The SE Shang Property Index (SHPROP)  has declined 5.8 percent in
2010, compared with a 6.5 percent drop for the broader index,
after the People’s Bank of China instructed banks to set aside
more deposits as reserves and the government took steps to curb
gains in asset prices.
