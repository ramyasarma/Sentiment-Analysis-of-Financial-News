             Saku Olletehase AS, Estonia's only
publicly traded beverage company, said its first-quarter loss more
than doubled as an increased dividend for majority owner Baltic
Beverages Holding AB and other investors led to a higher tax bill.  
 The net loss swelled to 31.5 million krooni ($2.7 million)
from 14.1 million krooni a year earlier, the company said today
in a stock exchange statement. Saku had tax expenses of 56
million krooni in the quarter after paying a dividend of 200
million krooni, or 25 krooni per share, in respect of 2006, when
the company's profit jumped 57 percent to 118 million krooni.  
 Estonian companies have to pay tax at a rate of about 28
percent on cash returned to shareholders in the form of
dividends. They pay no tax on reinvested profit. Saku is 75
percent-owned by Baltic Beverages Holding AB, a company jointly
owned by  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA)  and Scottish & Newcastle Plc.  
 ``The dividend payment, which cannot be sustained in the
longer term, reflects the fact that the company's growth
perspectives are rather limited as the Estonian beer market is
expanding less and less every year,'' said Triinu Viilup, an
analyst with Hansabank Markets in Tallinn.  
 Profit before tax rose to 25 million krooni in the first
quarter from 9.8 million krooni a year earlier. Revenue jumped
45 percent to 181 million krooni, the company said.  
 Premium Beers  
 Saku, which produces Estonia's most popular beer brand,
lifted sales of more expensive products and introduced other
beverages such as ciders and long drinks.  
 The shares rose 13 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 15.98 euros at
12:42 p.m. in Tallinn. The stock has gained 18 percent this year,
making it the fourth-best performer on Estonia's exchange. Saku
has a market value of about 128 million euros ($172 million).  
 Ireneusz Smaga, chief executive officer, said in an
interview on April 12 he expected Estonia's beer market to
maintain last year's growth of about 4 percent, in terms of the
volume of drinks sold. He forecast the market for premium beers
will grow as much as 20 percent in 2007 compared with 10 percent
last year. Saku expects to boost its share of that market to 70
percent this year from 67 percent previously, he said.  
 Saku, the maker of Originaal beer, has brands including
Rock and Tume. It competes with AS A.Le Coq Tartu Olletehas,
which is owned by Iisalmi, Finland-based Olvi Oyj.
