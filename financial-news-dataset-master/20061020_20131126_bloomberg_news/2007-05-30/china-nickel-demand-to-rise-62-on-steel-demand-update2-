             Demand for nickel in China, the
world's biggest consumer of the metal, may raise 62 percent by
the end of the decade because of rising demand from stainless
steelmakers, a government researcher said.  
 Demand for nickel will rise to 400,000 metric tons in 2010
from 247,000 tons in 2006, Zhang Mei, a researcher at the
Ministry of Land and Resources's information center, said today
at a conference in  Shanghai . Imports accounted for 61 percent of
the nation's demand last year and will rise to two-thirds in
2010, he said.  
 Nickel futures in London rose to a record this month as
China's economic growth fueled demand for the metal. Domestic
production of the metal in 2010 may rise 71 percent from 2005,
Zhang said. Most of the new capacity will come from Jinchuan
Group Corp., which supplies 90 percent of the nation's nickel.  
 ``Chinese producers, including Jinchuan, will boost
overseas purchase to meet rising demand,'' said Zhang in an
interview at the conference. ``The global nickel market will be
basically balanced in the next few years.''  
 The global nickel market will be in slight deficit this
year and move toward a balance in 2008, said John Barkas,
director of Metalytics, Sydney-based independent advisory firm
for the resources industry. Nickel will move into a surplus of
10,000 tons in 2009 and 40,000 tons in 2010, he said.  
 Cash Prices  
 Cash prices for nickel on the  London  Metal Exchange will
average $39,700 a ton this year, up 63 percent from 2006, Barkas
said. The prices will fall to $34,172 in 2008, $22,046 in 2009
and $16,535 in 2010. It closed at $51,650 yesterday.  
 The rising nickel and stainless steel prices may force
users including construction and packaging companies to switch
to aluminum products, the land ministry's Zhang said.  
 Cash prices of aluminum ingots on the Shanghai Changjiang
market have fallen 5.4 percent in the past year to 20,540 yuan a
metric tons.  
 ``If aluminum prices fall further, there will be wide
substitution for stainless steel in buildings and packaging
industries,'' Zhang said, ``Nickel prices are likely to hold up
at the high levels before next year.''  
 China 's production capacity for nickel may rise to 124,000
tons by 2010, from 72,700 tons in 2005, the land ministry's
Zhang said. Stainless steel production is expected to rise 70
percent to 9 million metric tons from 5.3 million tons in 2006,
said Zhang. ``The growth in China's demand for nickel will peak
in 2010 and slow down afterwards.''  
 Global stainless steel output is forecast to rise 5.1
percent to 29.8 million tons in 2007, after rising 17 percent
last year, the International Stainless Steel Forum said. China's
stainless steel production may rise as much as 50 percent this
year, after gaining 68 percent in 2006 to 5.3 million tons, Chai Zhiyong, president of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co., said
May 21.
