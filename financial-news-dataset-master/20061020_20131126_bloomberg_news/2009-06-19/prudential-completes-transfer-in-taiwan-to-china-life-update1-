             Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest insurer, boosted capital reserves by transferring its
Taiwanese distribution business and agency force to China Life
Insurance Co. of Taiwan.  
 The insurer’s capital surplus, measured by the insurance
groups directive, increased 40 percent to 2.8 billion pounds
($4.6 billion) from 2 billion pounds on May 14 as a result of
the deal, the London-based company said today in a statement.
Prudential announced the transfer Feb. 20.  
 The agreement will free up capital by shedding products
that pay guaranteed returns, which reduced profitability after
Taiwan began cutting  interest rates  in 2001. Prudential, which
operates in 13 countries in Asia, will continue selling
insurance policies in Taiwan through a bank distribution unit
and a 10 percent stake in China Life, bought for 45 million
pounds earlier this year.  
 Prudential said in February it will incur about 595 million
pounds in restructuring costs as part of the handover to China
Life.
