             Ukraine will buy natural gas worth
$250 million from Gazprom in June and quadruple the amount next
month, Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko said.  
 Ukraine plans to buy supplies for $1 billion in July, she
said today in a statement on the government’s Web site.  
 State-run energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy is in talks
with the European Union and  Russia  on loans to secure payments
to Gazprom on contracts from January that ended a three-week
dispute. Naftogaz’s First Deputy Chief Executive Officer Ihor Didenko visited Moscow this week for talks on amending the
contracts and cutting the amount of gas Ukraine is obliged to
buy this year. Timoshenko wants to lower imports to 33 billion
cubic meters from 40 billion, Interfax reported on April 27.  
 Domestic consumers have 26 billion hryvnias ($3.43 billion)
of debt to Naftogaz for fuel, Timoshenko said.  
 Local utilities whose arrears are the biggest will get
loans from state-run VAT Oshchadbank to repay debt and make
Ukraine “attractive” in relations with Gazprom, the premier
said in the statement. The plan has been approved by the central
bank and Naftogaz, Timoshenko said.  
 Naftogaz and the government have to make “extraordinary
twists” to provide timely payments, Timoshenko said.  
 Kiev-based Naftogaz got a $500 million loan from
Oshshadbank this month to pay for May gas. Ukraine pumped 800
million cubic meters of gas in April and 2.3 billion cubic
meters in May, Timoshenko said today.
