             Wesfarmers Ltd., whose businesses
range from mining and insurance to supermarkets, said coking
coal prices from its Curragh mine will fall about 59 percent as
the global recession curbs demand from steelmakers.  
 The price falls are “in line” with publicly reported
settlements of others and apply for the 12 months started April
1, Perth-based Wesfarmers said in a statement today. Wet weather
at Curragh in Queensland state will result in coking-coal output
at the “lower end” of forecasts between 6.5 million metric
tons and 6.9 million metric tons, it said.  
 Coking coal prices have more fallen by more than half since
reaching a record in 2008 as the global recession forced
steelmakers including ArcelorMittal and Posco to cut production.
Curragh is the largest of Wesfarmers’ three mines and the only
producer of coking coal.  
 Curragh coking coal production fell 11 percent to 1.45
million metric tons in the three months ended March while
steaming coal output rose 14 percent to 0.7 million tons.
