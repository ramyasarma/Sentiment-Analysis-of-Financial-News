             The Bank of Japan offered to
provide dollar loans to lenders to help ease concerns that
credit will contract in the wake of Europe’s financial crisis.  
 The loans are for 84 days from June 17 to Sept. 9 at an
interest rate of 1.23 percent against eligible collateral,
according to a BOJ announcement today in Tokyo. The  operation 
attracted bids worth $3 million, down from $210 million at the
previous injection on May 18. All bids were accepted.  
 “The BOJ is doing this just to show they are doing
something, as I think there’s enough liquidity in markets,”
said  Hiroaki Muto , a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “The BOJ doesn’t want to be blamed
for inaction in case something happens.”  
 The Bank of Japan decided to resume a U.S. dollar currency
swap agreement with the Federal Reserve in an unscheduled
policy meeting on May 10. Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi
said after the meeting Greece’s deepening fiscal woes aren’t
hurting Japan’s economy and that policy measures taken around
the world will help contain the European sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “Gains in dollar Libor have stopped so the bids at the
operation were lower than expected,” said  Toshiaki Terada , a
researcher at Totan Research Co. in Tokyo. “The BOJ probably
conducted it just to be safe.”  
 London interbank offered rates, or Libor, for three-month
 dollar  loans was unchanged at 0.537 percent yesterday. The rate
has been little changed since May 25.
