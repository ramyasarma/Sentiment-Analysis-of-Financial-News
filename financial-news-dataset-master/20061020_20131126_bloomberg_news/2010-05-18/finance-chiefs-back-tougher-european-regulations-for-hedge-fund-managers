             The European Union may delay a final
vote on rules to regulate managers of  hedge funds  and private
equity firms until September after the bloc’s Parliament and
national governments failed to reach an agreement, according to
a  European Commission  official with knowledge of the
negotiations.  
 Lawmakers, national governments and the commission still
need to strike a deal on how much information must be disclosed
by private-equity firms, on marketing rules and so-called
passports to operate throughout the 27-nation region, said the
official, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are confidential.  
 “We want to get a dynamic agreement which is as consensual
as possible and robust at a technical level,”  Michel Barnier ,
EU financial services commissioner, said in a statement today.
“The commission is trying to bring both sides closer
together.”  
 The delay may be a boost to the U.K., which has opposed the
new rules. EU finance ministers in May approved draft measures
to tighten hedge-fund regulations even as new U.K. Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  raised concerns about the law’s
affect on the industry.  
 The deal among ministers triggered talks with the  European
Parliament  and the commission on the final wording of the
proposals. All three groups must agree on the draft law before
it can be adopted.  
 Barnier said at a June 8 press conference that he planned
to conclude talks on the proposals by the end of this month.  
 Hedge-Fund Hub  
 Britain is home to 80 percent of  Europe ’s hedge-fund
management industry and 60 percent of private equity, according
to a report last year from the Financial Services Authority.
It’s also a hub for non-EU funds looking to market in Europe.
The U.K. didn’t have enough support among ministers to stop the
law from taking another step toward being implemented.  
 U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  raised concerns
with Barnier about the way the draft law may discriminate
against U.S. funds in a letter sent in March.  
 In their May agreement, finance ministers said hedge-fund
and private-equity managers should have to register in each EU
country they want to market their funds.  
 The European Parliament sought to force managers to agree
to transparency standards in exchange for a so-called passport
to market to investors in the 27-nation bloc.
