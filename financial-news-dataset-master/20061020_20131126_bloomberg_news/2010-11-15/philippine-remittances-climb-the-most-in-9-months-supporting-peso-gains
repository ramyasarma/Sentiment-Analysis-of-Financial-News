Remittances  sent home by Philippine
citizens abroad rose at the fastest pace in nine months as the
global recovery supported demand for Filipino sailors, engineers
and carpenters, spurring gains in the nation’s currency.  The  funds  increased 10.6 percent from a year earlier to
$1.6 billion in September, the central bank said in a statement
in Manila today. Remittances grew 7.8 percent to $13.8 billion
in the January-to-September period.  Rising remittances,  exports  and investment in the $160
billion economy have boosted the peso, prompting policy makers
to implement measures to slow the currency’s advance. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas last month eased rules on foreign-exchange
outflows, and Finance Secretary  Cesar Purisima  said last week
the government may pay some of its foreign debt ahead of
schedule and increase local borrowing next year.  “There’s still room for growth in remittances” going into
the fourth quarter when spending peaks,  Jonathan Ravelas , a
strategist at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. in Manila, said before
the report. The peso’s decline this month “is a long overdue
correction” and the currency will continue its advance until
next year as the dollar remains weak, he said.  Philippine reserves rose to a record $56.8 billion in
October. The peso reached 42.47 a dollar on Nov. 4, the
strongest level since May 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
