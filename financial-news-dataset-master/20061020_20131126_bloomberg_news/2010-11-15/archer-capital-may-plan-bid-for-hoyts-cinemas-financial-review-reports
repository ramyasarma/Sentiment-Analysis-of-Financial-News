Archer Capital is among a list of
private equity and pension funds said to have expressed an
interest in Pacific Equity Partners’ Hoyts cinema business, the

without saying where it got the information. Pacific Equity
Partners has sent out confidentiality agreements for the sale of
the A$500 million-plus business, without committing to a formal
