The euro area’s  budget deficit 
swelled to more than double the European Union’s 3 percent limit
last year, led by Greece and Ireland.  The total  budget gap  for the 16-nation euro region widened
to 6.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, the biggest
since the euro’s introduction in 1999, the EU’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. That matches an April estimate
and is more than triple the level of 2 percent in 2008.  The euro-area figures were delayed so the statistics office
could perform a quality assessment on Greek data. Greece’s 2009
shortfall was revised to 15.4 percent of GDP from an earlier
estimate of 13.6 percent, the highest in the euro’s history.  Ireland had the second widest deficit last year, at 14.4
percent of GDP. Officials in Dublin estimate the 2010 shortfall
will be about 12 percent of GDP, or 32 percent when the costs of
its banking rescue are included.  As Germany pushes Ireland to accept an EU bailout and help
reverse a bond sell-off, the Finance Ministry in Dublin said
late yesterday the government is in talks with European
officials about current “market conditions.” It denied
speculation that it will need a bailout before euro-area finance
ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow.  Overall  government debt  across the euro region increased to
79.2 percent of GDP last year from 69.8 percent in 2008,
remaining above the EU’s 60 percent limit, the statistics office
said in today’s report.  In the 27-nation EU, the deficit widened to 6.8 percent of
GDP last year from 2.3 percent in 2008, while debt reached 74
percent. Malta and Estonia were the only two EU member states to
report a drop in their budget shortfalls for 2009.  Countries that breach the EU’s  debt and deficit limits  can
be subject to economic sanctions, though none has been fined so
far. EU members overhauled the fiscal rules in 2005, easing
penalties for deficit overruns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
