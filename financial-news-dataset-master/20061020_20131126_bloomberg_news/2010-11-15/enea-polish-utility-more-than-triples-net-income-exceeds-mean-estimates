Enea SA, Poland’s third-largest
utility, said third-quarter net income more than tripled to
183.4 million zloty from 54.9 million zloty a year earlier. That
compares with the 154.8 million-zloty mean estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales increased to 1.96 billion zloty from 1.71 billion
zloty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
