Hungary’s government plans to keep
the budget deficit below 3 percent of economic output from next
year to cut government debt to less than 70 percent of gross
domestic product by 2014-2015, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  “We have one year to escape from the debt trap, or at least
to pry the trapdoor open,” Orban told lawmakers at the beginning
of the 2011 budget debate in Budapest today. “If we don’t
succeed, all our opportunities will be buried under the debt.”  Hungary, the first European Union member to get an
International Monetary Fund bailout in 2008, aims to cut the
 deficit  to 2.94 percent of GDP next year, below the EU’s 3
percent limit for the first time since joining the trading bloc
in 2004. Debt will reach 78.9 percent of GDP this year, the
highest in eastern Europe, according to the EU.  The Cabinet is levying taxes on the financial, energy,
retail and telecommunications industries at least through 2014
and using private pension fund assets to plug budget holes
created by switching to a 16 percent flat personal-income tax
next year.  The  forint  rose 0.1 percent to 276.73 per euro at 5:12 p.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index closed 1.1 percent
higher at 22,362.05.  The central bank on Nov. 11 said the fiscal measures would
allow the government to meet its budget-deficit goal in 2010 and
2011, widening the gap later because of a reliance on one-off
revenue generation.  The Cabinet is in talks with industry groups about
overhauling pensions, education, public administration,
healthcare and public transport, Orban said. The government will
present its plans for the “structural reforms” next spring,
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  told parliament today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
