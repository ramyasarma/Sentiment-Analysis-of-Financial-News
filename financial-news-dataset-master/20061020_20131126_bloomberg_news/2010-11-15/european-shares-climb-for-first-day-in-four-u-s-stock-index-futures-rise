European stocks advanced, sending
the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index higher for the first day in
four, as investors awaited a report that may show the world’s
biggest econonmy is improving. U.S. futures gained, while Asia
stocks fell.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.4 percent to 271.13 at 12:41 p.m.
in London as all but one out of 19 industry groups gained.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.4 percent amid concern
about China’s steps to cool inflation.    U.S. retail sales rose for a fourth month in October,
showing consumers are playing a bigger role in the recovery,
economists said before a Commerce Department report due at 8:30
a.m. in Washington. The projected gain of 0.7 percent would
follow a 0.6 percent advance the prior month. Other figures
today may show manufacturing in the New York region expanded and
businesses boosted stockpiles.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
