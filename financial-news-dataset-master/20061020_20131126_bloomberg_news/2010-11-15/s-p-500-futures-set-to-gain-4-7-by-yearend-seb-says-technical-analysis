Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index  may rise another 4.7 percent before the end of the 
year as the market shrugs off sovereign debt worries, according 
to a technical analyst at SEB AB.  “Short term we could have a bit of a bumpier road,”
 Anders Soederberg , chief technical analyst at SEB in Stockholm,
said today in a phone interview. “As long as the longer-term
trend stays intact and we don’t fall below the 21-day moving
average, we should have a theoretical target of 1,255 on the
upside.”  There was an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern from May to
early September that broke around the 1,120 area, Soederberg
said. The measure should continue rising through the end of the
year and reach 1,255 for the pattern to be complete.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in December advanced 0.1
percent to 1,196.5 at 10:51 a.m. in London. The gauge sank 2.2
percent last week as concern about Europe’s debt crisis
intensified, speculation China will boost interest rates grew
and  Cisco Systems Inc .’s forecasts missed analysts’ estimates.  A head-and-shoulders pattern occurs when share prices form
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. The
start of a decline is signaled when prices fall below a support
level in line with the low points between the peaks.  Technical analysts use price charts to forecast resistance
levels, or ceilings restricting further price increases, and
support levels, or floors limiting declines. The trading
patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
