China’s central bank may raise
interest rates twice late this year and early next year, the
Economic Daily reported on its website today, citing Chen
Xikang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  The country’s consumer prices may grow 4 percent in
November and December, pushing full-year inflation to 3.2 to 3.3
percent, the report said, citing Chen. China’s consumer prices
may grow at 4.7 percent next year, the report said, citing Chen.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
