Sun Resorts Ltd. , the second-biggest
hotel chain and tour operator in Mauritius by market
capitalization, said its loss for the third quarter widened 27
percent on lower revenue at its luxury resorts.  The net loss for the three months through September
increased to 133 million rupees ($4.4 million) from 105 million
rupees a year earlier, the Ebene-based company said today in a
statement on the  Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s  website. Revenue
fell 18 percent to 502.3 million rupees, it said.  “The middle to lower-end resorts experienced some growth
in occupancies, but luxury resorts are still experiencing
negative trend since the outburst of the financial crisis,” Sun
Resorts said.  The fourth-quarter results are likely to be in line with
the same period in 2009, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
