Namibia’s central bank said more
foreign banks will be able to operate in the country as the
result of the implementation of the Banking Institutions
Amendment Act.  “Over the past few years, limited competition
characterized the banking industry in Namibia,” the  Bank of
Namibia  said in a statement late yesterday from the capital,
Windhoek. "The law is now amended to address the concern.
Previously, the law only allowed for fully incorporated
subsidies and representative offices.’’  The central bank said it has been empowered to assess and
mitigate potential risks that banking institutions may be
exposed to as a consequence of the activities of other entities
within the same group of companies.  “This means that the bank is given power to regulate and
supervise the holding or controlling companies of banking
institutions,” according to the statement.  The central bank said the new measure, signed into law by
the nation’s president on Oct. 19, also gives it the authority
to deal with pyramid schemes by criminalizing such operations.  Under the legislation, the finance minister, on the
recommendation of the Bank of Namibia, can regulate the
ownership of banking institutions and controlling companies in
the country, according to the statement.  The central bank is now also allowed to impose
administrative fines on banking institutions, part of a move to
strengthen its oversight, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
