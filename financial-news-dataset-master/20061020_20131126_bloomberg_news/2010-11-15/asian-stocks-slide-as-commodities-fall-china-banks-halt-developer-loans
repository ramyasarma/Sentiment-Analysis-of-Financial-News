Asian  stocks  fell, the regional
benchmark index declining for a second day, as oil and metal
prices dropped and after a report that Chinese banks suspended
some lending fuelled speculation the country will act further to
cool its economy.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  declined 1.5
percent in Hong Kong after the state-run China Real Estate
Business newspaper said the biggest four banks won’t lend to
developers until next year.  China Construction Bank Corp. 
dropped 0.4 percent. China’s lenders pared losses after news
reports they denied the loan halt.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. ,
Australia’s biggest gold producer, lost 2 percent in Sydney
while Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore oil explorer, sank 1.8
percent in Hong Kong after commodity prices slumped on Nov. 12.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  declined 0.4 percent to 131.66
as of 4:13 p.m. in Tokyo, with about the same number of stocks
falling as rising. Energy, material and financial stocks paced
declines with concerns about the sustainability of the global
recovery intensifying as Ireland continued to resist pressure to
accept European help with its sovereign debt.  “The market’s focus is firmly back on how secure Chinese
growth is in the light of what’s come out on to the radar, and
what policy measures are likely to be implemented in response,”
said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “We may well be headed for
another period of consolidation as investors move to lock in
gains against a backdrop of rising uncertainty in the near
term.”  Japan Growth  China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent after
dropping as much as 1.5 percent earlier today. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index lost 0.6 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
rose 1.1 percent as a report showed the nation’s  economy  grew at
a faster-than-estimated pace in the third quarter.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 percent, while
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.5 percent in Wellington as
third-quarter retail sales unexpectedly increased.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.2
percent today. In New York, the index declined 1.2 percent to
1,199.21 on Nov. 12 amid concern China may raise interest rates
to curb inflation.  Industrial & Commercial Bank dropped 1.5 percent to HK$6.51
in Hong Kong.  China Construction Bank  fell 0.4 percent to
HK$7.40. China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., a builder
controlled by China’s construction ministry that makes 98
percent of its revenue in the country, fell 2.7 percent to
HK$16.02 in Hong Kong.  Loan Approvals  Approvals of new loans to property developers by the
country’s four largest banks ceased since the end of October
after they met their allotted targets for the year, the state-
run China Real Estate Business reported, citing unidentified
executives at the banks.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank
denied that loans to property developers have been halted,
Caixin Online reported today, citing unidentified people at the
banks. Agricultural Bank’s loans to developers next year will be
about 13 percent to 15 percent of total loans, the report said,
citing one of the people.  The  Shanghai Composite Index  tumbled 5.2 percent on Nov. 12,
the steepest drop since August 2009, on speculation an interest-
rate increase was imminent.  “The plunge may not fully reflect further tightening by
the government such as interest-rate and reserve requirement
increases,” said  Zhao Zifeng , who helps oversee about $10.2
billion at China International Fund Management Co. “It’s better
to be cautious.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 9.7 percent through
Friday in 2010, compared with gains of 7.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 6.4 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at an average 14.5 times estimated
 earnings , compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2
times for the Stoxx 600.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for December delivery dropped 3.3 percent to
$84.88 a barrel in New York on Nov. 12. The London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals including
copper and aluminum tumbled 3 percent amid concern that China’s
attempts to rein in inflation will cool demand for industrial
metals.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  slipped 0.4 percent to A$44.14 in Sydney.
The world’s largest mining company resumed a share buyback after
abandoning its hostile $40 billion takeover offer for Canada’s
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. in the face of government
opposition.  Newcrest Mining Ltd.  sank 2 percent to A$41.66 in Sydney,
and rival St. Barbara Ltd. lost 5 percent to 47.5 Australian
cents after gold futures for December delivery fell 2.7 percent
in New York on Nov. 12.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s second-biggest oil and
gas producer, dropped 1.4 percent to A$42.49. Cnooc declined 1.8

$18.5 billion.  Among stocks that rose today, Fast Retailing Co., Japan’s
biggest clothing chain operator, advanced 2.4 percent to 12,500
yen in Tokyo and Konami Corp., a video-game developer, gained
2.8 percent to 1,534 yen.  Japan’s  economy  grew at a faster pace in the third quarter
as consumer spending increased, shielding the expansion from a
stronger yen and export slowdown that are likely to have a
greater impact this quarter.  Gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.9 percent in
the three months ended Sept. 30, following a revised 1.8 percent
expansion in the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office said in
Tokyo today. The median forecast of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 2.5 percent increase.  AXA Asia Pacific surged 6.8 percent to A$6.17 in Sydney.
 AMP Ltd. , Australia’s second-biggest asset manager, and France’s
Axa SA bid at least A$13.3 billion ($13.1 billion) for the
 company , about 20 percent more than an initial offer that was
rejected a year ago. AMP’s bid matches a takeover offer from
National Australia Bank Ltd. that the country’s competition
regulator rejected two months ago.  To contact the reporters for this story:
