Clint Hurdle , who led the Colorado
Rockies to the World Series in 2007, was hired as manager of the
Pittsburgh Pirates, who haven’t made the Major League Baseball
playoffs in 18 years.  Hurdle, 53, spent last season as hitting coach for the
Texas Rangers, who batted a league-high .276 in Hurdle’s first
season. The Pirates hit .242, worst in the National League.  “Clint Hurdle is an extremely intelligent, passionate,
knowledgeable baseball man with proven leadership skills and
ability to move this team forward,” Pirates General Manager
 Neal Huntington  said in a statement released today.  Hurdle was also interviewed by the New York Mets as a
potential replacement for  Jerry Manuel , who was fired on Oct. 4.  Hurdle managed the Rockies for 7 1/2 seasons, compiling a
 534-625 record  and making the playoffs once, a 2007 run to the
World Series in which the Rockies won 14 of their final 15
regular-season games. He was fired in 2009 after an 18-28 start.
He replaces John Russell as the 39th manager in the Pirates’
124-year history.  Pittsburgh was 57-105 in 2010, their 18th consecutive
losing season. The Pirates have not made the  playoffs since 1992 
and have not made a World Series appearance since 1979.
Pittsburgh pitchers had a 5.00 earned-run average, the worst
staff ERA in the league. In addition to the league-worst ERA and
batting average, the Pirates committed 127 errors, tied for the
most in the NL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
