Dexia Crediop SpA said it plans to
appeal a ruling by an administrative court that backed the
provincial government of Pisa on its decision to annul
derivative agreements with the bank.  Dexia said in an e-mailed statement it will appeal the
ruling at Italy’s highest administrative court and that the
parties still need to meet their obligations.  Pisa, known for its leaning tower, was right in annulling
the contracts because the financing package sold by the bank,
which included swaps, didn’t reduce overall borrowing, a legal
requirement for municipal governments. The city alleged that the
bank hid so-called implicit costs on the swaps that made the new
financing by Dexia, a unit of Brussels-based  Dexia SA , and  Depfa
Bank Plc  more expensive than existing debt.  Pisa stopped making payments on the swaps last year,
claiming that 95 million euros ($129 million) of bonds and
derivatives sold to it by the banks in 2007 didn’t provide an
economic advantage to the city. Italian municipalities face
losses of about 1.1 billion euros on derivative contracts with
the country’s banks, outstripping gains by 11 times, Bank of
Italy data show.  Four banks face charges for fraudulently selling
derivatives to the city of Milan and are on trial. In another
case,  UniCredit SpA  must return 651,632 euros plus interest to
the Italian city of Rimini after a court ruled last month that a
swap contract between them was void.  To contact the reporter on this story:
