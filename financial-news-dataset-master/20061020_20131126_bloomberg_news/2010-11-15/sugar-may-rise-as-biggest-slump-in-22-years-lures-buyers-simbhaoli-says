Raw sugar may rebound as the biggest
slump in 22 years attracts buyers amid signs that global demand
for the commodity exceeds supply, according to  Simbhaoli Sugars
Ltd.  and other Indian producers.  “The market will come back with solid foundation because
physical buyers will become active,”  Sanjay Tapriya , finance
director at Simbhaoli, a 75-year old mill, said in a telephone
interview today.  Raw-sugar futures tumbled the most since July 1988 on Nov.
12 as speculation that China will raise borrowing costs roiled
commodity markets. Prices reached a 29-year high on Nov. 9 as
drought and floods damaged crops in Brazil, Russia and Pakistan.  “Brazil hasn’t improved its production and China, Russia
and Pakistan are still looking at imports,” said Abinash Verma,
director general of  the Indian Sugar Mills Association . “This
demand is expected to be met from India. There is nobody else
filling that gap. Thailand’s exports are lower than last year.”  The global raw-sugar surplus may be 2 million tons in 2010-
2011, down from 3.22 million forecast two months earlier,  Sergey Gudoshnikov , economist at the London-based International Sugar
Organization, said in an interview Oct. 26.  Exports from Thailand, the second-biggest supplier, may be
4.4 million tons in 2011, compared with 4.63 million in 2010 and
5.1 million in 2009, Secretary-General  Prasert Tapaneeyangkul 
said in an interview today.  Raw-sugar prices climbed 23 percent this year before the
three-day slide that ended with futures plunging 12 percent to
26.21 cents on ICE Futures U.S. on Nov. 12. Wholesale prices in
Mumbai have lost 20 percent this year.  ‘Abnormal’  “There will be loss of profit in exports” after the slump,
said  Vinay Kumar , managing director of the National Federation
of Cooperative Sugar Factories, a group that accounts for about
half the nation’s output. “The fall was sudden, abnormal.”  India’s government will decide on ending curbs on exports
completely after Nov. 21, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said last
week. The country may have a surplus of 3.5 million metric tons
in the year than began Oct. 1 after keeping aside 4 million tons
for the next season, he said.  “It’s strategic for India to export at this point of time
as we are likely to produce more,” Tapriya said.  Shares of Simbhaoli Sugars fell as much as 2.6 percent to
47.1 rupees in Mumbai trading, tracking declines in stocks of
rival producers.  Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd. , the biggest mill, lost
as much as 3.3 percent to 126 rupees, a third day of losses.
 Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd ., the second-biggest, slumped as much
as 7 percent to 83 rupees, the most in more than six months, and
Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. shed as much as 5 percent to 87 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
