European Union carbon allowances
advanced to a two-week high as German power and natural gas
climbed.  EU permits for December gained as much as 1.1 percent to
15.06 euros ($20.55) a metric ton and were at 15 euros as of
8:17 a.m. on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. They rose for
a fifth day.  Regulators said Nov. 12 sales for the post-2012 period of
the program are not likely to start in 2011 as further work is
needed on auction infrastructure.  German power for next year climbed as much as 0.5 percent
to 48.90 euros a megawatt-hour, the highest price since Oct. 13,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. U.K. gas for the
six months through September next year increased 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
