A business run by  David Stern , the
Florida foreclosure lawyer who is under investigation by the
state’s attorney general, entered a forbearance agreement with
lender Bank of America NA.  The bank agreed not to take action in the period ending
Nov. 26 over a default on a revolving line of credit by DAL
Group LLC, a unit of Stern’s foreclosure-processing company,
DJSP Enterprises Inc., according to a regulatory filing. The
credit line, entered into in March, has an outstanding principal
balance of about $12 million, DAL said.  Jeffrey Tew , Stern’s lawyer, said earlier this month that
Stern’s law firm and DJSP cut about half of their staff after
mortgage-financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ended
ties with Stern. Florida Attorney General  Bill McCollum  said he
is investigating Stern’s law firm because it appears to be
submitting “false and misleading” documents in foreclosure
cases.  Stern’s businesses continue to operate and have a total of
between 400 to 500 employees, Tew said on Nov. 4. DAL received a
notice of default from Bank of America on Nov. 5, according to
the regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
