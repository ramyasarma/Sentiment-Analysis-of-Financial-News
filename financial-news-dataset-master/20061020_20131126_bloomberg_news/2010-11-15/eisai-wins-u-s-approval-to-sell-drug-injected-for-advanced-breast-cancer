Eisai Co. , the maker of the
Alzheimer’s disease treatment Aricept, won approval to sell a
therapy for breast cancer, marking the Japanese company’s first
original drug in the U.S. in more than a decade.  The Food and Drug Administration said today that it cleared
Eisai’s eribulin mesylate for women with advanced breast cancer
after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. The Tokyo-based
drugmaker will sell the medicine under the brand name Halaven.  Breast cancer is expected to strike 207,090 women in the
U.S. this year and cause 39,840 deaths, according to the
 National Cancer Institute . Halaven prolonged survival by two and
a half months compared with current single-agent therapies in a
study of 762 women with advanced stages of the disease. The drug
will compete with Basel, Switzerland-based  Roche Holding AG’s 
Xeloda and New York-based  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s  Ixempra.  “There are limited treatment options for women with
aggressive forms of late-stage breast cancer who have already
received other therapies,” said  Richard Pazdur , director of the
agency’s Office of Oncology Drug Products, in a statement.
“Halaven shows a clear survival benefit and is an important new
option for women.”  The injectable medicine is a synthetic form of a substance
derived from a sea sponge. The drug is thought to work by
preventing tumor cells from growing, according to the FDA.  Eisai needs new products to counter revenue lost to generic
competition after Aricept’s patent expires Nov. 25. Aricept was
approved in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
