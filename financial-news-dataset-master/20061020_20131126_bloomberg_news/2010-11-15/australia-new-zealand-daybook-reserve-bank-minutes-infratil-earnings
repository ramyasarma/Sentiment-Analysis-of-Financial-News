An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks rose, rebounding after the
biggest weekly drop for benchmark indexes in three months, as
takeovers and faster-than-estimated growth in retail sales
fueled optimism about the economy.
*Ford Motor Co. rallied 4.1 percent to the highest price since
2004 ahead of General Motors Co.’s share sale this week.
*The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,204.04 as of 11:35 a.m. in New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55.7 points, or 0.5
percent, to 11,248.28.  London: European stocks climbed for the first time in four days
as increasing takeover activity and faster-than-projected growth
in U.S. retail sales boosted optimism in the economic recovery.
*Axa SA advanced 2.3 percent as the insurer made a joint bid
with AMP Ltd. for Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd.
*The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent to
272.36 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, rebounding from the
biggest weekly drop in six weeks. The gauge had earlier swung
between gains and losses at least nine times as investors
awaited more information on whether Ireland will seek assistance
to deal with its debt burden.  Tokyo: Asian stocks fell, the regional benchmark index declining
for a second day, as oil and metal prices dropped and after a
report that Chinese banks suspended some lending fuelled
speculation the country will act further to cool its economy.
*The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.4 percent to 131.66 as
of 4:13 p.m. in Tokyo, with about the same number of stocks
falling as rising.
*Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.1 percent as a report
showed the nation’s economy grew at a faster-than-estimated pace
in the third quarter.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1
percent to 4,688 as of the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index climbed 0.5 percent to 3,328.23 at
the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar rose to almost a six-week high against the
euro and climbed versus the yen as concern that some European
countries will struggle to repay debt and rising Treasury yields
boosted demand for the U.S. currency.
*The greenback touched the strongest level in five weeks against
the yen as U.S. 10-year note yields reached a three-month high.
The euro fell versus the dollar on speculation Ireland may need
a bailout.
*The dollar strengthened 0.6 percent to $1.3606 at 1:04 p.m. in
New York. It closed at $1.3691 on Nov. 12, after touching
$1.3574, its strongest level since Sept. 30.
*The greenback gained 0.4 percent to 82.82 yen, from 82.53 yen
on Nov. 12. It reached 83.25 yen, the highest level since Oct. 6.
*The yen rose 0.3 percent to 112.67 per euro, compared with
113.02.  TREASURIES  New York: The difference between yields on 2-and 10-year
Treasury notes rose as a report on retail sales showed economic
growth quickening and a group urged the Federal Reserve to halt
purchases of bonds, citing inflation risks.
*The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold 10-
year notes instead of those maturing in two years rose 5.5 basis
points to 2.33 percentage points.
*Ten-year note yields touched the highest since Aug. 6 as a
group including former Republican government officials and
economists urged the Fed to rethink quantitative easing. Retail
sales rose 1.2 percent in October, stronger than forecast.
*The yield on the 10-year note rose five basis points to 2.84
percent at 1:46 p.m. in New York.
*Two-year note yields fell two basis points to 0.59 and 30-year
bond yields increased two basis point to 4.31 percent, after
touching 4.34, the highest since May 18.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper rose, rebounding from the biggest decline in
four months, as sales at U.S. retailers climbed the most in
seven months, bolstering optimism for the economy.
*Copper futures for March delivery rose 2.65 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $3.9245 a pound at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. On Nov. 12, the price tumbled 3.3 percent, the
biggest decline since June 29.  GOLD  New York: Gold rose, rebounding from the biggest loss in four
months, on bets that mounting sovereign debt will erode
currencies and boost demand for the precious metal as an
alternative asset.
*Gold futures for December delivery rose $10.30, or 0.8 percent,
to $1,375.80 at 12:05 p.m. on the Comex in New York. On Nov. 12,
the metal lost 2.7 percent, the most since July 1. The price is
headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  OIL  New York: Crude oil was little changed, reversing an earlier
gain of as much as 1.1 percent.

earlier rose as high as $85.77 a barrel.  WHAT TO WATCH
