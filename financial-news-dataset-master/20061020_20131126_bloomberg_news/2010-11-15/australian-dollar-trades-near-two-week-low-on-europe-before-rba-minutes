The Australian dollar traded near
the lowest in more than two weeks amid concern some European
nations will struggle to raise funds.  Demand for the so-called Aussie was also trimmed before its
central bank releases minutes from this month’s meeting when it
raised interest rates and said a “modest” tightening of policy
was prudent. New Zealand’s currency may weaken for a fourth
day on speculation Ireland will need a bailout as European
officials push the nation to request aid.  “The Australian dollar will continue to take its cues from
the direction of investor risk appetite which is being buffeted
by fears of Europe’s debt problems,” John Kyriakopoulos,
Sydney-based head of currency strategy at National Australia
Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today. The Reserve bank’s
“tone won’t sound hawkish,” he said, keeping “risks for the
Australian dollar tilted down today.”  Australia’s currency traded at 98.54 U.S. cents as of 9:28
a.m. in Sydney from 98.53 cents in New York yesterday when it
touched 98.13 cents, the least since Oct. 29. The currency was
at 81.88 yen from 81.85 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar bought 77.24 U.S. cents from 77.29
cents. It fetched 64.18 yen from 64.20.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
