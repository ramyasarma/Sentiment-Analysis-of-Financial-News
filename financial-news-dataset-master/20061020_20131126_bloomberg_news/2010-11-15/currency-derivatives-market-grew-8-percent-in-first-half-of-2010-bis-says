Positions in foreign-exchange
derivatives contracts increased by 8 percent in the first half
of 2010, according to the Bank for International Settlements.  The amount outstanding in U.S. dollar-denominated contracts
increased by 11 percent and euro contracts dropped by 2 percent,
while Swiss franc contracts increased by 23 percent, the Basel,
Switzerland-based BIS said in an e-mailed statement today. 
The value of non-dollar denominated contracts may have been 
distorted by fluctuations in exchange rates against the dollar, 
the BIS said.  “Changes in the size of positions of other currencies are
more difficult to interpret, but there are reasons to believe
that strong underlying growth was offset by valuation effects
due to exchange-rate depreciation,” the statement said.  The euro fell 15 percent against the dollar in the first
half of this year.  Outstanding amounts of over-the-counter interest-rate
derivatives stayed at $452 trillion in the first six months of
2010, after increasing by 3 percent in the previous six months,
the BIS said.  Interest-rate contracts account for 82 percent of the over-
the-counter derivatives market, BIS said. Single-currency
interest-rate swaps account for more than three quarters of the
contracts in that category, with options making up 11 percent
and forward-rate agreements 13 percent as of June 2010, the BIS
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
