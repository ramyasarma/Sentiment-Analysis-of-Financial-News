European Central Bank council member
Axel Weber said systemically important institutions may need an
additional capital buffer.  In order to address the moral-hazard problems associated
with rescuing system-relevant institutions, several regulatory
instruments are needed, Weber said in a speech in Frankfurt
today. “One is in all likelihood a capital buffer,” he said.
“An alternative would be the recognition of so-called bail-in
instruments,” which in basic terms involve borrowed capital
that can be transformed into equity in times of distress, Weber
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
