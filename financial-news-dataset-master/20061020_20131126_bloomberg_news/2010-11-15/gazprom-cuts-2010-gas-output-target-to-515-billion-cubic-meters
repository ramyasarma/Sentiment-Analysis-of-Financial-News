OAO Gazprom  cut its natural-gas
production target for the second time this year because of
sluggish domestic and foreign demand.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, plans to produce
515 billion cubic meters this year, the Russian gas export
monopoly said today on its website in a third-quarter report
under Russian accounting standards. The Moscow-based company
forecast gas output at about 519 billion cubic meters in June,
down from a target of 529 billion cubic meters given by Chief
Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  in April.  Miller said in June that Gazprom, which supplies about a
quarter of Europe’s gas, may miss its output goal this year
after consumption in southern Europe declined, stalling a
recovery in demand after global economic growth revived.  Gazprom exports will be about the same volume this year as
last year, when sales outside Russia and former Soviet Union
republics were 140.6 billion cubic meters, Chief Financial
Officer  Andrey Kruglov  said in September.  The temperature in Russia, where Gazprom sells more than a
half its production, is expected to  exceed  the normal level by
an average of 1 degree to 2 degrees Celsius in November,
according to the country’s Hydrometeorological Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
