Itau Unibanco Holding SA plans to
sell real-denominated bonds due in five years as soon as
tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The bank may sell the bonds overseas to yield about 10.5
percent, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the terms aren’t set. Deutsche Bank AG, Itau and Morgan Stanley
are arranging the sale, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
