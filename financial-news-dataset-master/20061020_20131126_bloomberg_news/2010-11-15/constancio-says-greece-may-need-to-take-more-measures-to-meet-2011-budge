European Central Bank Vice President
 Vitor Constancio  said Greece may need additional measures to
meet its 2011 budget target after last year’s deficit was
revised higher.  Meeting the target for 2011 “may involve certainly new
policies which were not asked for or contemplated before,”
Constancio told reporters in Vienna today. The goal “should be
kept” and policies “should be adjusted to maintain that
target,” he said.  Greece’s 2009 budget shortfall was revised to 15.4 percent
of gross domestic product from 13.6 percent by the European
Union statistics office today. The deficit is the highest in the
euro’s history and the revision means the government won’t
achieve the targets it agreed in return for 110 billion euros
($150 billion) in EU-International Monetary Fund emergency loans
earlier this year.  Greece’s government has targeted spending cuts and revenue
increases to bring the budget gap to 7 percent of GDP in 2011
from 7.8 percent this year. The Finance Ministry said today that
after the revisions the budget deficit would be 9.4 percent of
GDP this year and debt will reach 144 percent of GDP. The
ministry reiterated its pledge to reduce the shortfall to the
EU’s 3 percent ceiling in 2014.  “The results for this year are in a big part the result of
an effect that the deficit for 2009 has been revised up,”
Constancio said. “It’s an automatic result that makes it more
difficult to achieve a target that was fixed when the deficit
for 2009 was thought to be lower.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
