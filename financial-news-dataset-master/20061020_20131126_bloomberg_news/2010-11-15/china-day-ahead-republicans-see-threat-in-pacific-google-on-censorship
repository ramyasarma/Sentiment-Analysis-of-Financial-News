The House Armed Services Committee’s
top Republican says he favors shifting defense dollars to boost
U.S. missile defense and to counter China’s ability to limit U.S.
operations in the western Pacific.  “While China today may not intend to attack our carriers,
neutralize our bases in Japan and Guam, or push back our naval
presence out of the South China Sea, they are without question
making the investments and developing capabilities to do just
that,” California Representative  Howard McKeon  says in remarks
prepared for delivery at a meeting sponsored by the Washington-
based  Foreign Policy Initiative  research group.  Google Says Censorship Is Trade Barrier  Google Inc ., owner of the world’s most popular Internet
search engine, urged the U.S. to combat Internet censorship
abroad as an unfair trade barrier.  China, Vietnam, Iran and Turkey are among countries that
have shut off of search engines, blogging platforms or social-
media websites such as  Facebook , Google said in a white paper.
Those actions are harming the ability of U.S. companies to
profit, Google said.  Youku Seeks Listing  Youku.com Inc ., China’s biggest online-video provider, will
seek to raise as much as $150 million in a U.S. initial public
offering as competition intensifies with rival  Tudou Holdings
Ltd.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  will underwrite Beijing-based
Youku’s IPO, the company said in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The pricing of the sale
wasn’t disclosed. Allen & Co., Piper Jaffray Cos. and Pacific
Crest Securities are also working on the sale, according to the
filing.  Shanghai Fire  An apartment-building fire in central  Shanghai  killed at
least 42 people, Xinhua News Agency said, citing a municipal
publicity department statement.  The fire was under control at 6:30 p.m. local time
yesterday, four hours after starting, Xinhua said. More than 100
people were received by local hospitals, and firefighters
continue to search for survivors, the official news agency said.  Warming Efforts Increased  China has stepped up its efforts to rein in global warming
by implementing rules that will cap emissions of greenhouse
gasses from its domestic industry, the chief climate negotiator
for the United Nations said.  “They have actually not just performed to the level of
their target, but they have outperformed,”  Christiana Figueres ,
the UN diplomat leading climate negotiations, said in a webcast
press conference from Bonn.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks erased gains, wiping out most of an 88-point
rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as increased criticism
of the Federal Reserve’s plan to stimulate growth and concern
that a swelling federal deficit will lead to higher borrowing
costs drove Treasury yields higher.  Pulte Group Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Titanium Metals Corp.
slumped at least 2.9 percent to help lead losses in the Standard

percent as  Bucyrus International Inc.  and Isilon Systems Inc.
surged more than 28 percent after receiving takeover offers and
 Ford Motor Co.  climbed 4.3 percent to an almost seven-year high
before General Motors Co.’s initial public offering.  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.1 percent to 1,197.75 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The Dow gained 9.39 points, or 0.1 percent, to
