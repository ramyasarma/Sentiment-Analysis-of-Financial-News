Argentines expect consumer prices to
rise 30 percent over the next 12 months, according to a poll by
Buenos Aires-based Torcuato Di Tella University.  Inflation expectations remained stable from last month
after rising from 25 percent in September, the university said
in a statement today.  The Nov. 1-10 poll of 1,210 people by Poliarquia
Consultores had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
