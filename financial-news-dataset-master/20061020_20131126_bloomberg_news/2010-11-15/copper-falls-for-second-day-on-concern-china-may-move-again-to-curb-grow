Copper rose, rebounding from the
biggest decline in four months, as sales at U.S. retailers
climbed the most in seven months, bolstering optimism for the
economy.  Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in October, the most since
March, Commerce Department figures showed today. That topped the
highest forecast among economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained as much as 0.7 percent.
Copper has rallied fivefold since 2002 on demand for the metal
used in buildings and electric grids.  “A few commodities like copper tend to move with the
economy,” said  Phil Streible , a senior-market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Prices are getting some
support from the S&P 500.”  Copper futures for March delivery rose 2.65 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $3.9245 a pound at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. On Nov. 12, the price tumbled 3.3 percent, the
biggest decline since June 29.  Earlier, futures dropped as much as 1.2 percent on mounting
concern that China’s bid to rein in inflation will damped demand
for industrial metals.  Tightening credit in China, the world’s largest metals
user, will “slow everything down and cap prices,” Streible
said. Copper won’t go much higher than $4.10 and may fall to
$3.80 by the end of the week, he said.  The most-active contract reached $4.0875 on Nov. 11, the
highest level since May 5, 2008, when copper reached a record
$4.2605.  “The market has certainly been unnerved by the Chinese
tightening fears, though the market also seems very bullish as
to copper’s longer-term prospects, with the recent selloff
triggering dip-buying interest,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at
Standard Bank Plc in London, said in a report.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $30, or 0.3 percent, to $8,645 a metric ton
($3.92 a pound).  Aluminum, lead, zinc, nickel and tin dropped in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
