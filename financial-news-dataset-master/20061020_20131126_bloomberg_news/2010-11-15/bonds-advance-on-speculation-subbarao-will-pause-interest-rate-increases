India’s 12-year bonds halted a
three-day decline on speculation a slowdown in factory output
growth will prompt the central bank to pause Asia’s most
aggressive round of interest-rate increases this year.  Yields on debt due 2022 were little changed after the
government said Nov. 12 that  industrial production  rose 4.4
percent in September from a year earlier, the slowest pace in 16
months. The  Reserve Bank of India , which raised borrowing costs
six times in 2010, may hold them for three months as  inflation 
moderates, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Nov. 2. Inflation
slowed in October to the lowest level in nine months, according
to a commerce ministry statement in New Delhi today.  “The weak industrial production report has triggered a
modest improvement in bond-market sentiment,” said  Bekxy Kuriakose , who manages the equivalent of $440 million in Indian
debt at L&T Investment Management Ltd. in Mumbai. “Yields may
still remain in a narrow range around current levels in the
short term.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 was
little changed at 8.06 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price was at
100.5350 per 100 rupee face amount.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 8.58 percent from
a year earlier after an 8.62 percent increase in September. The
median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an 8.5 percent gain.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee today sought parliament’s
approval for additional spending, mainly on fertilizer and oil
subsidies, and said the move won’t widen the budget deficit.  The government plans to spend an extra 449.45 billion
rupees ($10 billion) in the year ending March 31, Mukherjee said
in a statement. It will use its own budget savings to pay 251.32
billion rupees of the additional outlay and rely on tax and non-
tax revenue for the remaining amount, the minister said.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates,
was at 6.72 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
