South Africa rugby internationals
Chiliboy Ralepelle and Bjorn Basson have been sent home from the
tour of Britain and Ireland after testing positive for a banned
stimulant, South Africa Rugby said.  The tests followed the 23-21 win over Ireland in Dublin on
Nov. 6, the ruling body said in an e-mailed release. Wing Basson
and hooker Ralepelle are provisionally suspended from all rugby.  Basson injured an ankle in the 29-25 win over Wales two
days ago and was due to return home anyway. The Springboks play
against Scotland on Nov. 20 and England on Nov. 27.  The pair returned an adverse analytical finding for
methylhexaneamine, a “non-specified stimulant” on the
prohibited substances list of the World Anti-Doping Agency
(WADA), South Africa Rugby said. It’s scheduled to be re-
classified as a “specified stimulant” from Jan. 1, 2011, it
added.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
