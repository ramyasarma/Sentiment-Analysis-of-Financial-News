Electricite de France SA , the
biggest operator of nuclear reactors, reported nine-month sales
rose 9.5 percent and maintained its full-year financial targets.  Sales  in the nine months through Sept. 30 increased to 52.9
billion euros ($72.4 billion) from 48.4 billion euros a year
earlier, the Paris-based company said today in a statement.  The state-controlled utility kept its full-year growth
target for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of 3 percent to 5 percent and a stable dividend.
EDF also said net debt-to-Ebitda ratio will be “close” to 2.5,
the lower end of a previously given range of 2.5 to 3.  French nuclear output rose by 9.2 terawatt hours to 299
terawatt hours, “consistent with the nuclear output objective
for the year” of a range of 405 terawatt hours to 415 terawatt
hours, the operator of France’s 58  nuclear reactors  said.  EDF agreed last month to pay about $249 million to buy out
 Constellation Energy Group Inc .’s half of their nuclear venture.
Slumping power prices slashed the value of Constellation’s share
in three atomic plants in the U.S. that the two utilities owned
together. Forecasts of low future power prices prompted
Constellation to withdraw from talks on a government loan
guarantee for a new reactor in Maryland.  EDF  in July took a provision of 1.1 billion euros related
to its holding in Constellation due to the “less favorable”
outlook for power prices for existing generators and the planned
new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs, Maryland.  EDF, struggling to increase domestic atomic output, plans
to halt nine French reactors in 2011 for in-depth inspections,
50 percent more than the average in recent years. Chief
Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  pledged to raise French nuclear
output in 2010 to boost profitability and reach a target of
making 85 percent of the country’s reactors available for
electricity production by 2015.  EDF ran its reactors at an availability rate of 78 percent
in 2009 and wants an improvement of “at least” 1.5 percentage
points this year, Chief Financial Officer  Thomas Piquemal  said
in May.  The French state holds an 84.8 percent stake in the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
