Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month rose as
farmers withheld supplies and overseas buyers increased
purchases after futures plunged last week.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
November climbed to 50 cents to 53 cents a bushel above December
futures from 50 cents to 51 cents on Nov. 12, government  data 
show.  Soybean  premiums increased to 47 cents to 64 cents above
January futures from 47 cents to 62 cents.  “Cash markets are quietly firming after the plunge in
prices,” said  Tim Emslie , the research manager at County
Hedging Inc. in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Basis is
firming with rising futures to get farmers to sell more
bushels.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 21.5 cents, or 4
percent, to close at $5.555 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Oct. 20. The price dropped 9.1
percent last week. On Nov. 9, the grain reached $6.05, the
highest level for the contract since Aug. 29, 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 17.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $12.865 a bushel. On Nov. 12, the oilseed plunged
5.2 percent after reaching $13.485, the highest price for the
most-active contract since Aug. 28, 2008.  Futures rose today after the USDA announced corn-export
sales to South Korea and Egypt, and soybean and soybean-oil
shipments to unknown destinations. Argentina is in talks on
resuming corn exports to China.  “There appears to be some pent-up demand for corn and
soybeans,” Emslie said. “Nobody is confident predicting
whether China will buy corn from Argentina, but it did give the
market a boost today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
