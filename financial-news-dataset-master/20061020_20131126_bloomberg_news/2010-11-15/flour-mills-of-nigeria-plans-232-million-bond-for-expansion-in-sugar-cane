Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc , which
processes grain and sells cement, will offer 35 billion naira
($232 million) of bonds this month and use the proceeds to build
a sugar refinery in Lagos.  The sale forms part of a 70 billion-naira debt-issuance
program that shareholders approved in August, the Lagos-based
company said today in a presentation to investors. The book-
building for the sale of the bonds, which will yield 10 percent
to 12 percent, is expected to be completed this week, Pabina
Yinkere, an analyst at Lagos-based  Vetiva Capital Management
Ltd. , said by e-mail today.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and the continent’s
biggest oil producer, is expected to import 1.4 million metric
tons of raw sugar in 2010-11, up from 1.3 million tons in
2009-10, according to an April 13 estimate by the Foreign
Agricultural Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Local production is less than 5 percent of total consumption,
according to the agency.  The refinery will have a capacity of 750,000 metric tons a
year, and Flour Mills plans to develop a 15,000-hectare (37,000-
acre) sugar-cane plantation, it said, without adding where the
fields will be located. The two projects are scheduled for
completion in 2012.  The investment units of  United Bank for Africa Plc , the
country’s largest lender by branches, Zenith Bank Plc and
 Guaranty Trust Bank Plc  are helping with the sale.  Dangote Industries  Dangote Industries, a group controlled by billionaire  Aliko Dangote , is Nigeria’s largest domestic investor in the business,
the USDA said. Its interests includes Dangote Sugar Refinery
Co., the country’s largest refiner, which processes raw sugar
imported from Brazil, and Savannah Sugar Co., which grows sugar
cane in the northeastern state of Taraba, the U.S. agency said.  Flour Mills also plans to invest part of the bond proceeds
in a new mill that will produce 1,000 metric tons of soft wheat
a day and another for the production of 500 metric tons of pasta
daily, the company said in the presentation.  Net income for the period through September increased 20
percent to 5.85 billion naira compared with a year earlier, the
company said in a statement e-mailed by the Lagos-based  Nigerian
Stock Exchange  on Nov. 12. The bourse described the period as
the second quarter through September.  The share rose by 25 kobo, or 0.4 percent, to 68.5 naira at
the close of trading on the Lagos bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
