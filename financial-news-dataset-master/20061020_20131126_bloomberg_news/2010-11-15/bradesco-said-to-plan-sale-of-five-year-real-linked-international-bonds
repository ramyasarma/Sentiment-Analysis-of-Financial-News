Banco Bradesco  SA and Itau Unibanco
Holding SA plan to sell five-year international debt denominated
in reais as soon as this week, according to people familiar with
the offering.  Bradesco, Brazil’s second-largest bank by assets, hired
Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. to sell the notes, said one of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms
aren’t set. Bradesco will also manage its own sale.  Itau, Brazil’s biggest bank by market value, plans to sell
real-denominated bonds due to yield about 10.5 percent, people
said. Deutsche Bank AG, and Morgan Stanley are arranging the
sale, which Itau will also handle, according to the people.  The issuance of real denominated bond abroad is linked to
the 6 percent tax Brazil charges foreigners on some investments,
known as IOF, said  Tony Volpon , a Latin America strategist
at Nomura Securities in New York.  The government “left bond issuance paying no tax at all,”
Volpon said. “Get ready for a lot of real bond issuance
abroad,” he wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
