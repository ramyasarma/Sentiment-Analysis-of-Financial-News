Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA

at 115 basis points more than Euribor, according to a banker
involved in the transaction.  The bank will also sell at least 300 million euros of A2
notes at a spread of about 150 basis points, the banker said.
The notes are being sold through Siena Mortgages 7, a vehicle
