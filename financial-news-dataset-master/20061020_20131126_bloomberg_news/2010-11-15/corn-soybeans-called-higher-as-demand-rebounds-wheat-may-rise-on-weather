What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand rebounds from livestock
producers, food manufacturers and fuel makers following last
week’s 8.9 percent slide in prices, said  Doug Bergman , a grain
broker at Advantage Traders Group in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents higher in Chicago
on bets that demand from importers and investors will climb
after prices tumbled 5.2 percent on Nov. 12, Bergman said.
Soybean-meal futures may open $4 to $5 higher per 2,000 pounds,
and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a
pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as dry weather threatens crops in parts of the
U.S. western Great Plains and too much rain damages grain ready
for harvest in Australia, Bergman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
