The dollar may rise to a seven-week
high against the yen after it closed above resistance at its 50-
day moving average, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns.  The U.S. currency is poised to extend gains following its
biggest weekly rally in almost two months after it ended last
week above 82.19 yen, which was resistance on a descending trend
line that connected the highs of May 5, June 4 and Sept. 17,
said Pak Lai Ng, an analyst at Forecast Pte. The sustained break
of its 50-day moving average at 82.67 yen opens the way for the
dollar to target the 100-day average at 84.47 yen, he said.  “The dollar-yen is short-term bullish,” Singapore-based
Ng said in an interview. “Momentum is up. If you look at the
past, the 50-day moving average has been capping it so far.”  The dollar traded at 83.12 yen as of 8:01 a.m. in Tokyo,
after rising 3.6 percent from a 15-year low of 80.22 yen on Nov.
1. The greenback gained 1.6 percent last week, the biggest
advance since the period ended Sept. 17. It last traded at 84.52
yen on Sept. 24.  Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, also show the dollar is poised
to rise against the yen, Ng said.  The U.S. currency’s MACD was 0.0753 today, above the signal
line of minus 0.2724, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The
MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving
average from the 12-day average.  The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving average of
the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals. Resistance refers
to a level where sell orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
