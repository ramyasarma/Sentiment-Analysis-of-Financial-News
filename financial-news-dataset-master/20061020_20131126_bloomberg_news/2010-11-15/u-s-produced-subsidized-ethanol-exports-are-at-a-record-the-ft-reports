U.S.-produced ethanol, subsidized by
the federal government as an alternative to foreign oil, is
being exported in record quantities, the Financial Times
reported.  A U.S. tax credit to companies that blend ethanol with
petrol expires at the end of the year, the newspaper said.  Government figures last week showed that 251 million
gallons of fuel ethanol, mostly refined from corn, were exported
in the first nine months of the year, more than double the total
in 2009; actual exports may have been higher, since ethanol
mixed with gasoline before shipment isn’t counted, the FT said.  Robert Vierhout , of ePure, a European ethanol trade group,
said the tax credit for blenders wasn’t intended to subsidize
exports and spoke of legal action to stop such shipments, the
newspaper reported.  For Related News and Information:
