U.K. Justice Secretary  Ken Clarke 
set out plans to cut the amount of money spent subsidizing court
cases, reducing funding for litigation including divorce and
medical negligence in an effort to save 350 million pounds ($560
million) over four years.  The “no-win, no-fee” rules will also be changed to reduce
the number of cases filed. Plaintiffs will have to pay their
lawyer’s “success fee,” Clarke told lawmakers in Parliament in
London today. The aim is “to encourage them to take an interest
in controlling the costs being incurred on their behalf.”  Clarke said he wanted to see fewer cases reach court,
cutting the burden on the legal system and pushing potential
litigants toward mediation.  “It cannot be right that the taxpayer is footing the bill
for unnecessary court cases which would never have even reached
the courtroom door, were it not for the fact that somebody else
was paying,” Clarke said. “Legal aid will still be routinely
available in civil and family cases where people’s life or
liberty is at stake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
