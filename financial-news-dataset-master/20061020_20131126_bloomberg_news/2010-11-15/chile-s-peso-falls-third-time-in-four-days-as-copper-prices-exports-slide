Chile’s peso fell for the third time
in four days as declines in copper prices dimmed the trade
outlook of the world’s biggest producer of the metal.  The peso slid 0.5 percent to 483.8 per U.S. dollar at 9:17
a.m. New York time, from 481.45 yesterday.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 1.8
percent in London on concern that China, the world’s largest
user, may take more measures to cool its economy and on a
stronger dollar. Chile’s copper export revenue fell to $2.72
billion in October from $3.92 billion in September, according to
a statement posted today on the central bank’s website.  “Copper went down on hard-landing debate, and that had an
effect on the exchange rate here,” said  Cesar Perez , managing
director at Celfin Capital SA.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
