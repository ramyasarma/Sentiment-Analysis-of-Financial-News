The euro may recover to levels last
seen in January as any aid package for Ireland will ease
concerns about Europe’s sovereign debt and return the greenback
to its downward trajectory, according to Citigroup Inc.  Ireland is in talks with European officials about current
“market conditions,” an Irish Finance Ministry spokesman said
yesterday by email, as Germany pushed for aid to calm volatility
that sent borrowing costs of debt-laden countries to records.
The euro posted its biggest five-day loss since August last week
amid concern that some of the region’s nations will struggle to
reduce budget deficits.  “Markets are likely to view an aid package for Ireland as
euro positive since it would likely remove the risk of an Irish
default for the time being,” New York-based  Steven Englander 
and Singapore-based  Todd Elmer , currency strategists at
Citigroup, wrote today in a note to investors. “Dips
approaching recent lows in euro-dollar may represent buying
opportunities.”  Ireland had the highest euro-region budget deficit in 2009,
at 14.4 percent of gross domestic product, according to the data
compiled by Bloomberg News. The nation’s Finance Ministry
spokesman said Ireland has made no application for external
support, and the government is fully funded until next year.  The euro was at $1.3675 as of 7:29 a.m. in London from
$1.3691 on Nov. 12, when it touched $1.3574, the weakest since
Sept. 30.  “Over time, the trend toward dollar weakening will
reassert itself,” Elmer said in a telephone interview. “Into
the beginning of the next year, the euro will be trading beyond
recent highs and reach the $1.45 region.”  The euro sank to $1.1877 in June before rallying 21 percent
to $1.4282 on Nov. 4, the highest since Jan. 20. It hasn’t
traded at $1.45 since Jan. 15. European finance chiefs will meet
in Brussels tomorrow night.  To contact the reporters on this story:
