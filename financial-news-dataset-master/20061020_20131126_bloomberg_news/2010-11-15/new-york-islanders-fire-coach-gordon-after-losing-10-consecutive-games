The New York Islanders fired coach
 Scott Gordon  following a 10-game losing streak that left the
National Hockey League club in last place in its division.  Jack Capuano , who has coached the Islanders’ American
Hockey League affiliate the past four seasons, was named interim
coach, while Gordon will remain with the team as adviser to
General Manager  Garth Snow , the Islanders said in a  news release 
posted on their website.  “We believe we need a change in direction and, with the
majority of the regular season still ahead of us, our goal
remains to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs,” Snow said in
a statement. “Scott has made tremendous strides with our team
the past three seasons and I look forward to continuing our
relationship in an advisory capacity.”  Capuano joined the Islanders as an assistant coach during
the 2005-2006 NHL season. He had a 133-100-8-14 record coaching
the AHL’s Bridgeport Sound Tigers.  Gordon was an AHL coach before taking over the Islanders’
job in August 2008 after the team fired  Ted Nolan . He departs
with a 64-94-23 record.  The Islanders were beaten 5-1 at the Los Angeles Kings two
days ago for their 10th straight defeat, which includes a
shootout loss at the San Jose Sharks in New York’s previous
game.  With 11 points this season, the Islanders are 13 points
behind the Philadelphia Flyers, who lead the Atlantic Division
with an 11-4-2 record.  The Islanders haven’t reached the postseason since 2007 and
last won a playoff series in 1993. Capuano is their eighth coach
since the 1999-2000 campaign.  He’ll debut on Nov. 17 as the Islanders host the Tampa Bay
Lightning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
