China has been moving quicker on
implementing domestic rules that would help curb climate change,
helping efforts to rein in global warming, the United Nation’s
diplomat leading climate talks said.  “There is optimism” for the UN global warming talks
beginning Nov. 29, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in a webcast
from Bonn. China “has just completed five years of domestic
legislation on climate.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
