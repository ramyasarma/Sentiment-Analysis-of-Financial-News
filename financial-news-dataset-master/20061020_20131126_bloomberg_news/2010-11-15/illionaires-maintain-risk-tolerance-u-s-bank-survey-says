Wealthy U.S. investors maintained
their risk tolerance during the last three years, said a U.S.
Bank study.  Forty-seven percent of the millionaire survey’s respondents
said their appetite for investment risk hadn’t changed and 8
percent said they had become more aggressive, according to the
report released today by the Minneapolis-based company.  “This paints a picture of wealthy investors behaving quite
rationally amid the worst recession since the Great
Depression,”  Mark Jordahl , president of U.S. Bank’s wealth-
management group, said in a telephone interview. “They’re
looking forward with optimism.”  Sixty-one percent of respondents said they were seeking a
rate of return on their investments that outpaces inflation,
fees and taxes. Ten percent said they wanted to protect their
wealth by limiting losses. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
 38 percent  in 2008 as the global financial crisis clipped stock
portfolios.  Ninety-two percent of millionaires said they hadn’t
abandoned the stock market. About half of the millionaires
surveyed made no change in their allocations to equities.  The national survey was conducted online in September and
October among 1,609 adults with at least $1 million in household
investable assets, excluding primary and secondary residences,
and holdings in employer-sponsored retirement plans. Harris
Interactive Inc., a market-research firm in New York, conducted
the survey for U.S. Bank, a subsidiary of  U.S. Bancorp , which
had $291 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
