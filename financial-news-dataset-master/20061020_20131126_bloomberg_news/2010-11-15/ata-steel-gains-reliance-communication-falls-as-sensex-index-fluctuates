India’s benchmark stock index
gained for the first time in four days.  Tata Steel Ltd.  gained
after the nation’s biggest producer of the alloy returned to
profit in the second quarter.  Tata Steel advanced the most in a month. India’s Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  held out the prospect of decades of
“high growth” as he sought to woo investors to Asia’s third-
largest economy.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender,
climbed, snapping a five-day retreat, as  inflation  slowed in
October to the lowest rate in nine months, reducing pressure on
the central bank to extend Asia’s fastest round of interest-rate
increases this year.  “The growth is very strong,” said  Ajay Argal , who helps
manage about $15 billion in assets at Birla Sun Life Asset
Management Co. in Mumbai. “We expect inflation to come down.”
Argal expects corporate earnings to climb 20 percent in the year
ending March and in the next twelve months. Argal said he’s
buying pharmaceutical stocks, without naming them.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 152.80, or 0.8 percent, to 20,309.69 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge declined 4 percent last week after
the nation’s factory production slumped to a 16-month low and
amid speculation China will increase rates.  ‘Robust Growth’  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
added 0.8 percent to 6,121.60. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.6
percent to 2,578.70.  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at  19.3 times  earnings
after the gauge jumped 16 percent this year, the best
performance and most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest
stock markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tata Steel increased 1.9 percent to 618.3 rupees. Net
income was 19.8 billion rupees ($439 million) in the three
months ended Sept 30, compared with a 27.1 billion rupee loss a
year earlier.  “In the short term, it is reasonable to expect that the
economy will go back to the robust  growth  path of 9 percent
average that it was on before the global crisis slowed it
down,” Mukherjee said yesterday. “We are in a position to
sustain high economic growth in the coming decades.”  State Bank rallied 4.5 percent to 3,163.5 rupees, its
biggest advance in ten days.  ICICI Bank Ltd. , the second-biggest
lender, rose 1.9 percent to 1,223.2 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the
third-biggest lender, added 3.1 percent to 2,385.85 rupees, its
steepest gain in three months.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 8.58 percent from
a year earlier after an 8.62 percent increase in September,
according to a commerce ministry statement in New Delhi today.
The median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an 8.5 percent gain.  Foreign fund inflows have almost doubled this year to an
all-time high on the expectation consumer spending will boost
corporate earnings.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  1.11 billion rupees  ($25
million) of Indian stocks on Nov. 11, taking this year’s record
flows to 1.3 trillion rupees, according to data on the  website 
of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
