Poland should increase interest
rates “only if inflation grows dramatically, and nothing like
that is happening,”  Andrzej Kazmierczak , a member of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Council, said today in Warsaw.  Further appreciation of the zloty is “very likely” and
that this prospect is “another reason to leave rates
unchanged,” Kazmierczak said in a phone interview.  The comments come after the annual  inflation  rate rose to
2.8 percent in October from 2.5 percent in September, matching
the median forecast of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent on the month.  Since the consumer price index was driven by supply factors
that “cannot be affected by monetary policy” and core
inflation is seen remaining steady, policy makers “should be
very cautious in considering any interest rates changes,”
Kazmierczak said.  The central bank left its  benchmark rate  unchanged at a
record-low of 3.5 percent for a 16th month in October because of
concern that higher rates may attract capital inflows that would
strengthen the zloty, hurting exports and economic growth. The
bank will keep rates steady at its next policy meeting Nov. 22-
23, according to nine of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
