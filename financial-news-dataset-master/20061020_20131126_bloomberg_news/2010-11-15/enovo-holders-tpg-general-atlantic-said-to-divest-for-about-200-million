Lenovo Group Ltd.  shareholders TPG
Inc. and General Atlantic LLC are seeking about $200 million
from selling their holdings in the Chinese computer maker,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The investors are selling a combined 282.3 million shares
in Lenovo at HK$5.451 to HK$5.53 apiece, the person said,
declining to be identified because the sale isn’t public.  Nomura
Holdings Inc.  is the sole bookrunner on the deal.  On completion of the proposed sale, TPG and General
Atlantic will exit their investment in Lenovo, the world’s
fourth-biggest maker of personal computers, after the stock rose
14 percent this year. The private-equity firms initially
invested in Lenovo in 2005, when the Chinese company bought the
PC unit of  International Business Machines Corp.  to expand its
international operations.  Angela Lee , a spokeswoman at Lenovo in Hong Kong, didn’t
immediately reply to messages sent by e-mail and left on her
office and mobile telephones seeking comment today.  Lenovo shares fell 1.6 percent to HK$5.53 in Hong Kong
trading today, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  General Atlantic, TPG and its unit Newbridge Capital own a
combined 2.8 percent stake in Lenovo, according to the Chinese
company’s website. The firms began selling down their holdings
in the computer maker in 2007, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
