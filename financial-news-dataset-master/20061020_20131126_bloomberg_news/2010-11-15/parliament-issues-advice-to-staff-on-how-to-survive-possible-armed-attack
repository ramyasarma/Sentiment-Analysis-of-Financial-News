Security authorities at Britain’s
 Parliament  have issued staff with instructions on what to do if
the building comes under armed attack, stressing that there is
no specific intelligence of one.  The note urges those working in the building in London to
flee an attack, rather than attempting to barricade themselves
in, noting that the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that left 166
dead lasted three days.  “We have contingency plans to cover a range of
emergencies, of which this is one,” the House of Commons said
in an e-mailed statement today. “It does not relate to a
specific threat. We do not comment in detail on security
matters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
