Canada’s dollar climbed for the
first time in three days as a report showed retail sales in the
U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner, rose last month more
than economists forecast.  The Mexican peso and the loonie were the only major
currencies to rise versus the U.S. dollar among the 16 most-
traded counterparts of the greenback tracked by Bloomberg. The
euro fell versus the Canadian currency on concern Irish banks
will need a bailout from the European Union.  “The market sentiment is mixed,” said  John Curran , a
senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-
exchange dealer in Toronto. “The real concern is Europe, and
the loonie should follow market events.”  Canada’s currency, known as the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.2 percent to
C$1.0099 per U.S. dollar at 5:25 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0123
on Nov. 12. One Canadian dollar buys 99.02 U.S. cents. The
currency touched parity Nov. 5-11.  The loonie pared its gain as North American stocks and
crude oil prices erased their advances. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  dropped 0.1 percent after earlier rising 0.7 percent.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index slid by the same amount after
gaining 0.6 percent. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest
export, decreased 0.4 percent to $84.58 a barrel after earlier
rising 1.1 percent to $85.77 a barrel.  The Canadian dollar gained 1 percent to C$1.3721 versus the
euro as European Central Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio 
said Ireland would be able to tap the European Union’s rescue
fund to bail out its banks. The U.S. dollar gained 0.8 percent
to $1.3587 against the euro.  Loonie Crosses  Investors in loonie crosses, currency pairs not involving
the dollar, stepped up their focus on Canada’s trading
relationship with the U.S. after speculation began four months
ago that the Federal Reserve would resume purchasing Treasuries
to keep interest rates low, according to  Shaun Osborne , chief
currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto.  “The approach of the markets generally speaking seems to
be what’s good for the U.S. dollar is good for the Canadian
dollar on the crosses, whereas what’s bad for the U.S. dollar is
equally bad for the Canadian dollar,” Osborne said. “The
markets have been very closely focused on the economy that’s
most highly leveraged to the U.S. The data from the U.S. has
been a little better.”  The Canadian dollar advanced 0.9 percent to 82.27 yen and
appreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.6211 versus the pound.  U.S. Retail Gain  Retail sales  in the U.S. climbed in October by the most in
seven months, a report from the Commerce Department showed.
Purchases rose 1.2 percent after a 0.7 percent increase in
September that was larger than previously estimated. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.7 percent
advance last month.  Canadian government bonds tumbled, pushing the yield on the
10-year security up as much as 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 3.14 percent, the highest level since Aug.
5. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020
slid C$1.02 to C$102.99.  The 10-year bond yield will fall to 2.83 percent by year-
end, according to the median of estimates from economists
gathered Nov. 4-11. The previous survey called for a 3 percent
yield by the end of the year.  U.S.  Treasuries  slid today as retail sales increased and a
group including former Republican government officials and
economists urged the Fed to reconsider purchases of debt, known
as quantitative easing.  Bank of Canada  The Bank of Canada refrained from raising its policy  rate 
on Oct. 19 after three prior increases to 1 percent. Policy
makers won’t boost borrowing costs again until the April-June
period, according to the survey.  Investors are betting the central bank will keep interest
rates unchanged until mid-2011. The rate on the six-month
overnight index swap was 1.10 percent on Nov. 12, and the nine-
month rate was 1.17 percent. Investors are betting 10-year bond
yields will be 3.13 percent in December, according to futures
contract trading on the Montreal Exchange on Nov. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
