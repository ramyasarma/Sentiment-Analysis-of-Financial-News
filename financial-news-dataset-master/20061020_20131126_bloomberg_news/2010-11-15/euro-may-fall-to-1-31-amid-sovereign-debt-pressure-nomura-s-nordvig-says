Concern that some European countries
will struggle to pay their debt has driven the euro down 12
percent versus the dollar since 2008 and may push it even lower,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The euro may fall to as low as $1.31 if sovereign-debt
problems escalate,  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency
research at Nomura in New York, wrote in a note to clients. The
crisis currently accounts for a 12 percent risk premium on the
currency, Nordvig wrote, citing a Nomura model.  The 16-nation currency fell 0.5 percent to $1.3619 today in
New York, near a six-week low of $1.3574 reached on Nov. 12.
While it has dropped 4.9 percent versus the greenback this year,
it has surged 14 percent from a 2010 low on June 7 on concern
that a new round of a Federal Reserve bond purchase program
known as quantitative easing will debase the dollar.  “The euro has been on a roller-coaster ride over the last
year,” Nordvig wrote. “There has been significant upside
pressure on euro-dollar from the Fed’s initiation of QE2.
Meanwhile, peripheral tensions within the euro zone have risen
again, putting notable downward pressure on the euro.”  The euro will trade at $1.38 in six months if sovereign
risk remains roughly constant, Nordvig wrote. The currency will
drop to $1.33 if debt concern increases, and $1.31 if the
European debt crisis has an impact on real-rate expectations.
The shared currency will strengthen to $1.44 if sovereign-debt
risk abates, he wrote.  Investors should trade the euro versus other European
currencies, and not just the dollar, Nordvig said today in a
radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  “The euro crosses, like euro-Sweden, euro-Norway and euro-
sterling, have not fully reflected it like it’s been reflected
in euro-dollar,” Nordvig said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
