U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu
urged China to expand subsidies to cover foreign clean-energy
companies as well.   Subsidies should be “even-handed,” Chu said at a round-
table discussion in Shanghai today. He asked for “reciprocity”
from China on subsidies.  The U.S. and China should work together on clean energy,
Chu said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
