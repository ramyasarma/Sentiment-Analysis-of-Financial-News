Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  may ask President  Giorgio Napolitano  to call early
elections for only one of the two chambers of parliament,
Corriere della Sera reported, citing the premier.  The government will look for the support of both the upper
and lower houses of parliament after the budget plan is
approved, Berlusconi said in a message sent to a political rally
of his People of Liberty party in Milan, according to Corriere.  “If we won’t have a majority in both, we will go to an
early vote for the chamber of deputies” or lower house, the
Milan-based newspaper cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
