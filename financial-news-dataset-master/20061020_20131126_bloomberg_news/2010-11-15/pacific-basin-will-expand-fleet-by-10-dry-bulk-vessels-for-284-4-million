Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd.,  Hong
Kong’s largest operator of dry-bulk vessels, will expand its
fleet by spending $284.4 million on 10 more ships.  Six handysize carriers with capacity to hold 35,000
deadweight tons each will be built by Jiangmen Nanyang Ship
Engineering Co. and be delivered in 2012 and 2013, Pacific Basin
said in a statement today. Four handymax transporters
constructed by Tsuneishi Group (Zhoushan) Shipbuilding Inc. are
on order with delivery in 2013, it said. Handymaxes can handle
40,000 to 60,000 deadweight tons of cargo, according to Drewry
Shipping Consultants Ltd. in London.  The orders “represent a sizeable expansion of our owned
capacity to satisfy our industrial customers’ demand for dry
bulk freight services,”  Klaus Nyborg , chief executive officer
of Pacific Basin, said in the statement.  The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of costs to ship
dry-bulk commodities such as grains and coal, fell 7.3 percent
last week on an oversupply of vessels, the fourth consecutive
weekly decline. Rental rates on handysize ships dropped 3.1
percent last week, the eighth consecutive drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
