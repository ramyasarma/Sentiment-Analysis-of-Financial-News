Promotion of Rural Initiative and
Development Enterprises Ltd. , a Tanzanian microlender, said it
received bids for 22 percent more bonds than the 14.5 billion
shillings ($9.69 million) it offered.  The securities began trading on the Dar es Salaam Stock
Exchange today, Managing Director Rashid Malima told reporters
in the commercial capital. The debt, which will pay a fixed rate
of 11.75 percent, will help fund a program to reach more than
10,000 small businesses and farmers, he said.  The bonds are guaranteed by the  U.S. Agency for
International Development .  “Pride becomes the first microfinance institution not only
in Tanzania, but in sub-Saharan Africa to issue a bond and we
are very proud to assist,” said Robert Cunnane, USAID’s mission
director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
