Investors may profit by buying the
difference, or spread, between Euribor contracts expiring in
December 2010 and 2011 before the European Central Bank reviews
its money-market refinancing operations, Newedge says.  “Money markets have somewhat normalized, but many banks
are still depending on the ECB for liquidity,”  Jamal Meliani , a
Paris-based fixed-income analyst at Newedge, wrote in an e-
mailed report today. “As the ECB reviews its liquidity-
providing conditions in December, the most likely scenario is
where it extends its current conditions for its weekly main
refinancing operation and one-month operations, but reverts to
normal conditions for three-month tenders.”  The ECB will “extend full allotment, fixed rates, at least
for open market operations,” Meliani said, referring to the
central bank’s weekly main refinancing and one-month operations.
This would lead to “higher excess liquidity, a sharp fall in
rates at the very front end and upward pressures on maturities
beyond April.”  “We suggest going long the December 2010-December 2011
Euribor spread at 49-50 basis points,” Meliani said.  The spread between the December 2010 and December 2011
futures contracts on the three-month euro interbank offered
rate, or Euribor, was 51 basis points as of 11:28 a.m. in
London. That matches the highest level since July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
