Bolivian economist Marcelo Zabalaga
was sworn in today as the interim president of the country’s
central bank, replacing  Gabriel Loza Telleria .  Loza Telleria, the bank’s interim chief since November
2008, cited “strictly personal reasons” for his resignation,
according to a Nov. 12 letter of resignation to Bolivian
President  Evo Morales  provided by the central bank.  The bank’s new chief is a graduate of the University of
Geneva in Switzerland, where he earned a degree in economics and
a master’s degree in development studies. He also holds master’s
degrees in social sciences and corporate bank management earned
in Bolivia, according to the central bank.  Zabalaga, 57, was named interim superintendent of banks and
financial entities by Morales in 2007. He held the post until
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
