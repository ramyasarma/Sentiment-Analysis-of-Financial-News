Canadian  housing starts  will decline
next year, and sales of existing homes fell last month by more
than one fifth from a year earlier, adding to evidence that
housing will subtract from growth next year.  Housing starts will drop to 174,800 units in 2011 from a
forecast of 186,200 units this year, Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corp. predicted today.  Existing home sales were 22 percent below the record level
reached in October 2009, according to a statement from the
Canadian Real Estate Association. Using seasonally adjusted
figures, existing home sales rose 4.6 percent in October from
the previous month, the report from Ottawa also said.  Housing is slowing after the government ended temporary
stimulus measures and Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  warned
about record household debts. The central bank, which raised its
 benchmark lending rate  three times to 1 percent this year,
predicted in October housing will cut 0.2 percentage point to
growth in 2011, after adding 0.6 percentage point this year.  “Housing starts will decrease next year to levels which
are more in-line with long-term demographic fundamentals,” CHMC
Chief Economist  Bob Dugan  said in an e-mailed statement. “High
 employment levels  and  low mortgage rates  will continue to
support demand for new homes in 2011.”  Low Mortgage Rates  The average five-year mortgage rate stood at 5.29 percent
on Nov. 3, close to March’s 5.25 percent, which was the lowest
in more than 50 years.  Ottawa-based government agency CMHC said it expects
existing home sales to be little changed at 438,400 units next
year, from 440,300 units in 2010. CMHC also said it expects
prices to “edge only modestly higher” next year.  CREA earlier this month reduced its home resales forecast
for the second time this year, citing a sluggish economic
recovery and weak consumer confidence. Sales will fall 4.9
percent to 442,200 units this year and by 9 percent next year to
402,500 units, the group said in a Nov. 5 e-mailed statement.  Sales of existing homes in the January-October period were
0.3 percent higher than during the same months last year on a
seasonally adjusted basis, CREA said.  The real estate group also said sellers listed 68,353 new
homes in October, 1.3 percent higher than in September. The
inventory of homes on the market represents 6.2 months worth of
sales, down from 6.5 months in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
