A U.K. manager at PM Group Plc
illegally traded shares of the company based on inside
information and then laundered the proceeds through his father,
prosecutors told jurors at a trial today in London.  Neil Rollins, 46, of Keighley, England, sold shares of PM
Group in 2006 because he knew the company was about to announce
it was experiencing a fall in orders, prosecutor Tony Shaw said.
Rollins, a senior manager at PM Group, was told along with other
employees not to trade the shares.  “This did not stop Mr. Rollins,” Shaw said. “He avoided
the losses that were coming like a steam roller down a track by
selling his shares,” he said. He then “aggravated” the
offense by laundering the proceeds, Shaw said.  According to the indictment, Rollins sold 74,000 shares in
the company in August and September 2006. He transferred 120,000
pounds ($193,000,) to his father, the indictment said.  Rollins denies the charges. His lawyer Gareth Rees, will
present his case later in the trial.  Bradford, England-based PM Group, which was bought by
 Vishay Intertechnology Inc.  in 2007, makes scales used in the
waste-management industry. In December 2006, PM Group discovered
that Rollins had sold the shares and fired him, Shaw said.  This is the fifth insider-dealing case brought by the
Financial Services Authority which, prior to January 2008, had
never prosecuted the crime. Insider dealing carries a maximum
sentence of seven years in prison.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
