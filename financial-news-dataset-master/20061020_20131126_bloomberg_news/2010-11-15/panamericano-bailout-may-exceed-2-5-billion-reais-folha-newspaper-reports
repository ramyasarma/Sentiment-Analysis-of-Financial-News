Banco Panamericano SA ’s rescue by
its controlling shareholder,  Silvio Santos , may exceed 2.5
billion reais ($1.5 billion) after an investigation into
“inconsistencies” at the bank is concluded, Folha de S. Paulo
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bank’s bailout was calculated to include 2.1 billion
reais of losses stemming from the sale of credit portfolios and
400 million reais related to credit-card operations, the
newspaper said. The 400 million-real figure is an estimate made
by Grupo Silvio Santos heads and may increase after the central
bank completes a probe into the bank, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
