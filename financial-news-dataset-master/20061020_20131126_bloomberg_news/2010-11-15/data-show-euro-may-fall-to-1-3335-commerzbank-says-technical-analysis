The euro may weaken to as low as
$1.3335 should it break below a key support level against the
U.S. currency, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Euro-dollar last week sold off towards its 55-day moving
average at $1.3551,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income,
commodity and currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in
London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “We would allow for
some near-term consolidation above this level as the market
attempts to absorb recent losses.”  The euro weakened 0.5 percent to $1.3621 as of 11:29 a.m.
in London.  While capped by the 20-day moving average at $1.3891, “the
risk will remain for a slide lower to the $1.3365 and $1.3335
support,” Jones wrote.  Those levels represent “the 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement and the August peak,” she added.  A support level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed for a drop below that level. Fibonacci analysis is based
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
