Corn rose in Chicago after the
grain’s biggest slump in six weeks attracted importers and
investors.  March-delivery corn added 1.4 percent to $5.5575 a bushel
at 1:19 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
slid 5.2 percent on Nov. 12, rounding out a weekly slump of 8.9
percent.  “It’s a bit of a rebound,” Wayne Gordon, a senior analyst
at Rabobank Groep NV, said by phone from Sydney. “On a
fundamental basis, clearly balances are still tightening and are
likely to be tighter for longer. That should be, all else being
equal, supportive of prices.”  China may continue to import the grain as it builds up
stockpiles, even as the U.S. government forecasts higher
domestic production in the Asian nation, Gordon said.  Wheat for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to $7.1425 a
bushel after sliding 4.6 percent on Nov. 12. Milling wheat for
January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris advanced 1.2
percent to 215 euros ($292.94) a metric ton.  January-delivery soybeans gained 0.6 percent to $12.77 a
bushel in Chicago after declining 5.2 percent on Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
