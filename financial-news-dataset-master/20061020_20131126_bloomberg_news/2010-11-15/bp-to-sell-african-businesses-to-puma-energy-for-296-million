BP Plc , seeking to cover clean-up
costs in the Gulf of Mexico, agreed to sell its fuels marketing
businesses in Namibia, Botswana and Zambia to Puma Energy, as
well as 50 percent interests in BP Malawi and BP Tanzania.  Puma Energy, a subsidiary of Amsterdam-based commodities
trader Trafigura Beheer B.V., will pay BP a total of $296
million in cash for the fuel marketing units, the London-based
company said in a statement today. The sales do not include
refining and marketing operations in Mozambique or South Africa,
BP said.  The oil company is seeking to conserve capital and avoid
risk after the spill at its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico
left it facing a bill projected to reach $40 billion. The
southern African businesses supply commercial fuels, aviation
fuel and lubricants and include about 190 service stations
across the five countries, BP said.  “We targeted the BP portfolio for the outstanding quality
of its staff and assets, its key account customer base and for
the strategic fit,” Puma Energy Chairman Pierre Eladari said in
the statement.  Sonangol, Angola’s state-owned petroleum company, will take
a 10 percent stake in the acquired businesses, BP said. The
sales will be completed in 2010 in Botswana and through 2011 in
the other countries, BP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
