French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
replacement of ministers may make the government more receptive
to efforts to curb the nation’s budget deficit, boosting its
bonds, Nomura International Plc said.  “With few changes in the economics and a modest shift to
the right and a more austerity-friendly French cabinet, we
believe this weekend’s change is generally a positive outcome”
for French government bonds, a team of analysts led by  Nick Firoozye  in London wrote in an investor note today.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year French
government bonds instead of benchmark German bunds narrowed one
basis point to 43 basis points as of 7:19 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
