Ford Motor Co.  rose to the highest
in almost seven years in New York trading as investors’
excitement builds in rival  General Motors Co. ’s impending public
stock offering amid strong U.S. car and truck sales.  Ford gained 70 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $17 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the  shares ’
highest closing price since Jan. 8, 2004. They have advanced
70 percent this year, including a 39 percent jump since Oct. 1.  GM, which is expected to price its initial public offering
this week, is generating investor interest in autos, said  Joseph Phillippi , an analyst.  “People are refocusing on the auto industry because of the
GM IPO,” said Phillippi, principal of AutoTrends Inc., a
consulting firm in Short Hills, New Jersey. “Ford is putting
together a real terrific track record. The numbers are going to
continue to get better because they have good product
momentum.”  Ford earned $6.37 billion in the first nine months of the
year, the most since 1998. New models like the Fiesta compact
and redesigned Taurus sedan have helped drive Ford’s U.S. sales
up 21 percent this year, almost twice the market’s gain of
11 percent.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.2 percent last month, exceeding
the highest forecast among economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, according to data from the Commerce Department issued
today in Washington. A 5 percent gain among auto dealers led the
rise as U.S. light vehicle sales reached a 12.3 million annual
selling rate, the highest of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
