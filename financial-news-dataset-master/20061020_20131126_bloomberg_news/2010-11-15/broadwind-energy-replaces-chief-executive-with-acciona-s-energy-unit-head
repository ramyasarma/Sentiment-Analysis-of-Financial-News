Broadwind Energy Inc.,  a maker of
wind-turbine components that’s dropped 78 percent in New York
trading this year, hired  Peter C. Duprey  as chief executive
officer to replace  J. Cameron Drecoll , who is retiring.  Duprey, 53, was most recently chief executive for the North
American energy unit of the Spanish construction company  Acciona
SA , Naperville, Illinois-based Broadwind said today in a
statement. Drecoll, who agreed to consult for the firm for a
year during the transition, will leave effective Dec. 1.  Duprey will be paid a $50,000 signing bonus and an annual
base salary of $450,000, the company said in a regulatory
filing. He was also granted options to buy 220,000 common shares
and 180,000 restricted shares and may receive an annual bonus
equal to his base pay, the company said in the filing.  Broadwind has  lost money  on sales of its turbine towers,
gears and other components in each of the past 12 quarters,
partly because of a decline in demand. The U.S. added 395
megawatts of wind-power capacity in the third quarter, down more
than 75 percent from installations in the year-earlier period,
according to the American Wind Energy Association.  Broadwind rose 7 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $1.75 at 12:30
p.m. in Nasdaq trading. Broadwind reported Nov. 5 its net loss
in the third quarter had widened to $8.3 million compared with
$4.9 million a year earlier as revenue fell 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
