Japanese  stocks  rose as the nation’s
economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, boosted
by domestic demand, and the yen weakened.  Fast Retailing Co. , Asia’s No. 1 clothing chain, climbed
2.4 percent. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions,
advanced 2.7 percent. Olympus Corp., an optical instrument maker
that derives almost 60 percent of its sales abroad, rose 3.7
percent. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. lost 0.5 percent after the
Mail on Sunday reported Genzyme Corp. of the U.S. approached the
company to sell itself.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.1 percent to
9,827.51 at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix 
index gained 0.5 percent to 851.56 with nine stocks advancing
for every five that fell.  Japan’s GDP figures were “strong even though the growth
was buoyed by a subsidy program for eco-friendly cars, and
tobacco purchases before a tax hike,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who
helps oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset
Management Co. “Japanese stocks are cheap considering strong
corporate earnings and valuations.”  The Topix has declined 6.2 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 7.5 percent by the S&P 500 and 6.4 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
15 times estimated  earnings , compared with 14.1 times for the
S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Economic Growth  Japan’s economy grew an annualized 3.9 percent in the three
months ended Sept. 30, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo today.
The median forecast of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for a 2.5 percent increase. Growth may slow to a 0.3 percent
rate in October to December, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists taken before today’s data, with seven of 15
of them predicting GDP will shrink.  Fast Retailing jumped 2.4 percent to 12,500 yen. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s No. 1 automaker, increased 1.5 percent
to 3,140 yen, a level not seen since Aug. 3. The companies were
the biggest contributors to the Nikkei’s and the Topix’s gains
respectively.  Consumption, accounting for about 60 percent of GDP, led
the gain as households stepped up purchases of fuel-efficient
cars ahead of the expiration of a subsidy program and as smokers
stocked up before an Oct. 1 tobacco-tax increase.  “Overall, growth is picking up,” said  Takuji Okubo , chief
Japan economist at Societe Generale SA in a Bloomberg Television
interview from Tokyo. “It’s all coming from domestic. We could
say Japan is soft-landing from export-led growth to domestic-led
growth.”  Sony, Olympus Rise  Sony climbed 2.7 percent to 2,790 yen, the highest close
since May 31.  Olympus  climbed 3.7 percent to 2,249 yen. Hoya
Corp., Japan’s biggest maker of eyeglass lenses and which gets
60 percent of its revenue outside Japan, rose 1.3 percent to
1,955 yen. Nikon Corp., a camera maker that gets about 24
percent of its revenue from Europe, gained 0.8 percent to 1,668
yen.  The yen weakened to 113.65 against the euro from 112.07 at
the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Nov. 12. Against the
dollar, Japan’s currency depreciated to 82.77, compared with
82.33. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  “The pause in the yen’s appreciation and the higher-than-
expected economic growth boosted the market,” said  Hiroshi Fujimoto , a fund manager at Shinkin Asset.  Yen Depreciates  The  yield  on the 10-year note increased three basis points
to 2.82 percent as of 12:43 p.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor
Market Data. It was the highest level since Sept. 13.  The yield is rising “partially because of expectations for
the U.S. economic outlook, so I don’t think the yen will likely
keep rising,” T&D Asset Management’s Amano said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist  Kathy Matsui  increased
her rating on Japan’s equities to “neutral” from
“underweight,” citing U.S. economic recovery and monetary
policy tightening in China.  Among stocks that declined, Takeda Pharmaceutical lost 0.5
percent to 3,920 yen after the Mail on Sunday reported Genzyme
approached the company to sell itself for more than $18.5
billion. The newspaper cited a person it said was familiar with
the matter. Mihoko Shinomiya, a spokeswoman for Osaka, Japan-
based Takeda, declined to comment on the report, saying the
company doesn’t respond to market speculation.  To contact the reporter for this story:
