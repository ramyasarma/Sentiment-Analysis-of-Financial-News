Sony Corp. will buy 10 million
liquid crystal display panels from Taiwan’s Chimei Innolux Corp.

Kogyo newspaper said.   Sony won’t increase investment in a display factory
established jointly with Sharp Corp., the newspaper reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
