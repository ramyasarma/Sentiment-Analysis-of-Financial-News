China’s measures to ease gains in
its real estate market couldn’t contain the increase in the
country home prices, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in Macau yesterday.  He also told Macau residents that it is “very difficult”
to prevent further gains in the city’s home prices, according
comments broadcast by the Hong Kong-based Cable Television.  China’s central bank raised bank reserve requirements last
week to tame inflation and restrain foreign capital after the
U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing monetary policy.
China also has tightened rules on down payments, suspended
mortgages for third homes, and last month raised interest rates
for the first time in three years.  China’s  property prices  rose 8.6 percent in October from a
year earlier, the slowest pace in 10 months, the statistics
bureau said last week. The Royal Bank of Canada said after the
release of the data that the government would want further
easing of property prices and the “policy bias” is in favor of
more interest rate increases.  Policy makers may introduce more measures in the fourth
quarter amid signs of a price recovery, according to Nomura
Securities Co. The likely policies include a property tax and
the enforcement of the so-called land added-value levy in the
“overheated cities,” the brokerage said in a Nov. 4 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
