Treasuries fell as a report showed
retail sales rose for a fourth month in October, increasing
optimism that consumer spending may be improving and adding to
the economic recovery.  Ten-year note yields reached the highest since Aug. 6.
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said
the central bank may need to tighten monetary policy even with
an elevated unemployment rate to avoid a surge in inflation. The
Fed is scheduled to buy Treasuries each day this week under its
plan to pump $600 billion into the economy through June to spur
growth. Retail sales rose 1.2 percent, stronger than forecast.  “We won’t see signs of a rapid acceleration in the
immediate term, but we are growing and not heading back into a
recession,” said  Thomas Simons , a government debt economist in
New York at Jefferies Group Inc., one of 18 primary dealers
required to bid at Treasury auctions. “We’ll continue to leak
lower in price until we start to see the Fed buying.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note rose eight basis points to
2.87 percent at 8:34 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 2.625 percent security due in November 2020
declined 22/32, or $6.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 28/32.
They increased 26 basis points last week, the steepest gain this
year. Five-year yields advanced 11 basis points today to 1.48
percent.  The 1.2 percent increase in retail sales was the biggest
gain since March, following a 0.7 percent September increase
that was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department
figures showed today in Washington. The median estimate of 74
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 0.7 percent
advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
