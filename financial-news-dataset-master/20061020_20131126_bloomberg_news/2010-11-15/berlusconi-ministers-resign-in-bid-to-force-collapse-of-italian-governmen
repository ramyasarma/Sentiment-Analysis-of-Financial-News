Four members of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi’s government, who are now part of a rival
political party, have sent letters of resignation to the premier
in a bid to force the collapse of the government.  Adolfo Urso, deputy industry minister and one of the
ministers quitting the government, said in an interview with Sky
TG24 that the new Future and Liberty for Italy party would seek
an alliance with any other political parties willing to change
the country’s voting law to prepare for early elections.
Gabriele Barone, spokesman for Urso, confirmed the comments.   To contact the reporter on this story:
