Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA , Europe’s
biggest supplier of building materials, targets annual growth
of more than 8 percent through 2015 for its distribution unit,
Chief Executive Officer  Pierre-Andre de Chalendar  said.  Growth will be led by an increasing need for energy
savings and efficiency, the CEO said today at the company’s
headquarters in Courbevoie near Paris. The distribution unit
aims for “internal growth” of 4 percent to 5 percent, and an
operating margin of 6 percent, the company said in a document
presenting mid-term financial goals.  The CEO has said the maker of glass, plasterboards and
pipes will focus on housing and construction products, and
seeks medium-sized acquisitions in emerging markets and in the
energy-efficiency and solar-energy industries.  Saint-Gobain 
said on Oct. 13 the company may sell a minority stake of its
packaging business in an  initial public offering  next year.  Asia and emerging markets will represent 39 percent of
sales for the construction products and innovative materials
units in 2015, up from 31 percent in 2010, de Chalendar said.  Saint-Gobain aims to generate 2 billion euros ($2.73
billion) in sales of panels, components, glass and mirrors used
in solar energy in 2015, up from 300 million euros this year,
the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
