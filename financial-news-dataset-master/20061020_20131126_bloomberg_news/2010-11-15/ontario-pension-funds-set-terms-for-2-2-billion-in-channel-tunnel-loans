Borealis Infrastructure Management
and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan set terms on 1.38 billion
pounds ($2.2 billion) of loans for the High Speed 1 Channel
Tunnel line, two people involved in the transaction said.  The facility includes a 860 million-pound term loan and a
65 million-pound revolving credit line, both for five years, and
a 450 million-pound term loan for seven years. The five-year
portions initially pay 125 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, while the seven-year loan pays a
starting margin of 175 basis points, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the deal is private.  Borealis, the infrastructure unit of the Ontario Municipal
Employees Retirement System, and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension
Plan bought a 30-year concession this month to run the 68-mile
(109 kilometer) High Speed 1 line linking London to the Channel
Tunnel, known as the Chunnel.  BNP Paribas SA, Export Development Canada, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Lloyds Banking Group Plc, National Australia Bank Ltd.,
Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Banco
Santander SA and Bank of Nova Scotia underwrote the debt, the
people said.  John Pierce , a spokesman for OMERS, and  Deborah Allan , a
spokeswoman for Ontario Teachers’ Pension, weren’t immediately
available to comment outside of business hours in Canada.  The three-month London interbank offered rate, an average
of rates set daily by banks and used as a borrowing benchmark,
is 0.2844 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
