Raw-sugar futures rebounded after
India, the world’s second-biggest producer, said it plans to be
“cautious” on ending export curbs. Coffee and cocoa also rose.  India needs to ensure domestic sugar supplies are adequate,
Junior Farm Minister K.V. Thomas said today. On Nov. 12, sugar
prices plunged the most in 22 years after ICE Futures U.S.
boosted margins on contracts by 81 percent.  “The most important thing is what India’s going to do,”
said  James Kirkup , the head of sugar broking at ABN Amro Markets
(U.K.) Ltd. in London. “India is the swing factor in
statistics, determining whether the market is in deficit or
surplus. If they decide to not license any exports, the market
will go through the roof.”  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery gained 0.82 cent, or
3.1 percent, to settle at 27.03 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
in New York. On Nov. 12, the price plunged 12 percent, the most
since July 1988, partly on concern that China may raise lending
rates, curbing commodity demand.  India was the largest importer last year after adverse
weather slashed domestic output, data from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture showed. Brazil is the biggest producer.  Indian Farm Minister Sharad Pawar said last week the
country will decide on ending all curbs on exports after Nov.
21.  On Nov. 12, sugar touched 25.56 cents, the lowest level
since Oct. 8. Prices surged 24 percent last month, partly on
concern that crops were damaged by adverse weather in Brazil,
China and Russia.  Output Declines  As of Nov. 11, Russia’s output from domestically grown
beets fell 11 percent to 2.18 million tons since refining the
crop began in August, compared with the same period a year
earlier, the producers’ union said  today.    In London, white-sugar futures for March delivery settled
unchanged at $677.10 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe. Earlier, prices
rose as much as 1.6 percent. On Nov. 12, the price plunged by a
record 12 percent.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for March delivery
gained 3.9 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.0725 a pound. In London,
robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose $27, or 1.4
percent, to $1,902 a ton.  Cocoa futures for March delivery climbed $43, or 1.5
percent, to $2,822 a ton on ICE. In London, cocoa for March
delivery gained 31 pounds, or 1.7 percent, to 1,858 pounds
($2,985) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
