JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended
buying oil should crude prices dip if China raises interest
rates to curb inflation.  There would likely be a “dramatic” price decline if China
raises interest rates,  the bank said in a note today. “We
continue to emphasize that any price drop in crude, similar to
Friday’s, is an opportunity to buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
