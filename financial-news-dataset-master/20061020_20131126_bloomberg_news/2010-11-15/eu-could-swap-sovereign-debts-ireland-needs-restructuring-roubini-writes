The European Union should study the
examples of countries including Pakistan, Ukraine and Uruguay
that exchanged sovereign debt for other assets as the EU faces
the danger that putting private bank losses on to public balance
sheets could leave its governments insolvent,  Nouriel Roubini 
writes in the Financial Times.  “There will soon need to be a public debt restructuring”
in Ireland, and the key question for EU policymakers is how the
restructuring should be conducted, the professor of economics at
New York University writes.  A similar debate occurred in 2001 and 2002 when the
International Monetary Fund proposed a sovereign debt
restructuring mechanism in insolvent emerging markets to
determine which debt holders would be repaid and how much,
Roubini writes.  The EU has maintained that it has no formal legal mechanism
to restructure debt, but restructuring can occur using the
traditional tool of a bond-exchange offer and a formal mechanism
is not necessary, Roubini says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
