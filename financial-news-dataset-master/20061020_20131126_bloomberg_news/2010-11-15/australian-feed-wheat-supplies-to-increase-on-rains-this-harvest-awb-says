Australia will have increased
supplies of feed wheat this year for export as continuing
rainfall turns more milling-quality grain into stockfeed, AWB
Ltd., the country’s largest shipper, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “AWB is already making strong export sales of feed wheat,
with steady inquiry appearing from customers in Asia and Pacific
markets, where we have a significant freight advantage over just
about every other origin,” the company’s General Manager
Commodities Mitch Morison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
