Israel Discount Bank Ltd.  dropped
the most in two months on plans by the country’s third-largest
lender to raise at least 400 million shekels ($109 million) from
a sale of stock to the public and rights offering.  The shares  retreated  as much as 2.6 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Sept. 16, to 7.326 shekels and were 1.4
percent lower at 7.414 shekels at 12:44 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  The share sale, together with second-half profit, should
help the bank meet the Bank of Israel’s capital-adequacy
requirement,  Meir Slater , an analyst at Tel Aviv-based DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. said by telephone.  Supervisor of Banks  Rony Hizkiyahu   in June asked  the
country’s lenders to present plans to “boost the risk-weighted
ratio of core capital to at least 7.5 percent” by year end. The
lender’s core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio was 7.17 percent as
of June 30, according to its  second-quarter report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
