The Bank of Canada will keep its
 policy rate  unchanged until the second quarter as economic
growth slows, according to a Bloomberg News survey that also
showed bond-yield forecasts were cut for a fourth month.  The central bank didn’t raise rates Oct. 19 after three
prior increases and won’t act again until the April-June period,
compared with the earlier forecast of a first-quarter increase,
the survey showed. Canada’s three-month treasury bill will yield
1 percent at year-end, down from 1.1 percent in last month’s
survey, to match the Bank of Canada’s overnight target for loans
between commercial lenders.  Governor  Mark Carney , 45, has said there are limits to how
far Canada can  diverge  from the U.S., where the Fed said on Nov.
3 it plans to buy an extra $600 billion of Treasuries to support
the recovery. The so-called quantitative easing may not benefit
Canada much because it’s pushing up the Canadian dollar and
making goods more expensive abroad, said  Paul Ferley , assistant
chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.  “To the extent the Bank of Canada shares that concern
about slowing growth it’s a reason to delay hiking rates,”
Toronto-based Ferley said.  The 10-year government bond yield will be 2.83 percent on
Dec. 31, according to the median of 20 estimates gathered Nov.
4-11. The last survey called for a 3 percent yield by the end of
the year. The 10-year bond yield was 3.02 percent on Friday.  “The longer and larger Fed QE becomes, the further the
Bank of Canada probably extends its policy pause,”  Michael Gregory , senior economist at Bank of Montreal in Toronto, wrote
in a Nov. 12 note to clients. “Government of Canada bond yields
should decrease in the wake of declining U.S. Treasury yields.”  Factory Decline  Investors are betting the Bank of Canada will keep interest
rates unchanged until mid-2011. The rate on the  six-month
overnight index swap  was 1.10 percent on Nov. 12, and the nine-
month security’s was 1.17 percent. Investors are also betting
10-year bond yields will be 3.13 percent in December, according
to futures contract trading on the Montreal Exchange Nov. 12.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of Canada’s corporations rather than its
federal government narrowed on Nov. 12 to 135 basis points, or
1.35 percentage points, from 138 the day before and 141 a week
earlier, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. That’s
the narrowest so-called spread since May.  Relative yields on U.S. corporate bonds ended last week at
175 basis points, from 176 the week before, the Merrill data
showed. Global corporate spreads were 167 basis points, two
basis points wider than the previous week. Canadian corporate
bonds have lost investors 0.6 percent this month, compared with
declines of 0.1 percent for U.S. company debt and 0.2 percent
for global corporates.  Provincial Bonds  In provincial bond markets, relative yields ended last week
at 51 basis points, from 53 basis points the week before and
matching the tightest spreads since April. Spreads have dropped
from as wide as 71 basis points over federal benchmarks on May
21, when concern about debt levels in Europe was at a peak.  Provincial and municipal bonds have lost 1.3 percent this
month, compared with a loss of 0.9 percent for U.S. municipals.  Canada will auction C$1.4 billion in 30-year bonds on Nov.
17. The 4 percent bonds will mature in June 2041. The previous
auction of 30-year bonds, on Sept. 1, drew an average yield of
3.489 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.27.  30 Years  The benchmark 30-year yield rose 14 basis points last week,
or 0.14 percentage points, to 3.63 percent. The price of the 5
percent security due in June 2037 dropped C$2.79 during the five
days to C$123.30.  Canada’s 30-year bonds yielded 65 basis points below the
equivalent maturity U.S. security, compared with an average of
about 6 basis points over the last decade, according to
Bloomberg data.  Gross domestic product  grew at a 1.6 percent annualized
pace in the third quarter, according to the median of 20
responses, less than the 2.1 percent estimate taken last month.  “It’s not just trade that has slowed,” said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
“Domestic demand seems to have slowed, and the housing market,
from a boom in the first half of the year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
