East European central banks should
follow “flexible inflation targeting” to be able to “absorb
risk premium shocks” while ensuring “price and financial
stability in the long run,” Hungarian Central Bank Vice
President Julia Kiraly said.  “Inflation target as a final nominal anchor is transparent
but flexible enough to avoid reacting to excessive risk premium
volatility with interest rate policy and to incorporate other
type of policy considerations, like macro-prudential ones,”
Kiraly said, according to a text of her speech obtained by
Bloomberg News and to be delivered at a conference in Vienna
today.  Central and eastern European policy makers should
coordinate “macroprudential regulation” to “mitigate systemic
risk” from volatile capital flows, such as potential “hot
money inflows,” Kiraly said in the text of her speech.  Coordinaton of macro-prudential policy would serve to
“avoid regulatory arbitrage” and to “provide a level playing
field for financial instiutions.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
