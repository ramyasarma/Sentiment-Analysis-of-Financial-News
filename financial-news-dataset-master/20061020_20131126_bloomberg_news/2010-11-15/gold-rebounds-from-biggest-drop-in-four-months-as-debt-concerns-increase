Gold rose, rebounding from the
biggest loss in four months, on bets that mounting sovereign
debt will erode currencies and boost demand for the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  The euro fell against the dollar on concern that Ireland
may need a bailout. Gold has gained 25 percent this year,
touching a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9 partly on
speculation that the Federal Reserve’s program to buy back bonds
will erode the dollar.  “Demand for gold as an alternative currency is alive and
well,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
Chicago. “The fiscal and debt problems of the West will
continue to support gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $3, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1,368.50 at 2:06 p.m. on the Comex in New York. On
Nov. 12, the metal lost 2.7 percent, the most since July 1. The
price is headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  European leaders are meeting in Brussels tomorrow to
discuss financial support for Ireland. Gold priced in euros
reached a record in June on investor concern that Greece would
be bankrupt.  “Gold benefited in May and June when sovereign-debt
concerns were at their peak,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at
MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. “There’s the potential that
gold resumes its role as a safe haven if problems with European-
sovereign debt continue to grow.”  Limited Rally  Gains for precious metals may be limited for the rest of
the year as fund managers book profits, said Lesh of FuturePath.  “Gold has hit its objectives on the upside and given
people huge profits for the year, so people are paring back
their positions,” Lesh said.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 15 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $26.092 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has gained
55 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $7.65, or 1.1
percent, to $681.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum for January delivery added $1.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,685.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  Palladium has gained 67 percent in 2010 and platinum has
rallied 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
