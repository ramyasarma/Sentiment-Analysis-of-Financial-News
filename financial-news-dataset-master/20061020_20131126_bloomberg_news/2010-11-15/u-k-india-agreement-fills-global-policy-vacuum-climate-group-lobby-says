Britain and India’s pact to deal
with reducing carbon emissions and spur their economies could
help fill a policy vacuum in the absence of an international
treaty to replace Kyoto, The Climate Group said today.  Business leaders from the two nations are due to announce
today an agreement to work together to cut carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas linked with industrial growth and blamed for
climate change.  “This ground-breaking Charter will guide crucial
government and industry collaboration that will be good for the
environment and UK and Indian jobs,” said Steve Howard, chief
executive officer of The Climate Group, a London-based lobby.
“I think we will see more bilateral efforts like this filling
the international policy vacuum.”  About 190 nations will meet in Cancun, Mexico on Nov. 22 to
continue talks to extend or replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
Governments failed to agree on extending targets to limit CO2
last year in Copenhagen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
