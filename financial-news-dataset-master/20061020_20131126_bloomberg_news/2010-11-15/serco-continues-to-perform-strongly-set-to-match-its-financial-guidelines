Serco Group Plc, the operator of
London’s Docklands Light Railway, said it continued to perform
strongly in the second half and is set to match its financial
guidelines for this year.  Serco, which started the Barclays Plc-sponsored London
Cycle Hire scheme in July, had 16.7 billion pounds ($26.9
billion) on its order book at the half year, the Hook, England-
based company said in a PR Newswire statement today. The company
expects to increase revenue to about 5 billion pounds and
adjusted operating profit margin to around 6.3 percent by the
end of 2012.  “In the current economic environment, there remains strong
global demand for the efficient delivery of essential services
which drives significant opportunities for Serco in both
existing and new markets,” the company said. “This and our
operational and financial performance during the year supports
our expectation of achieving strong organic revenue growth in
2010 and making further progress towards our 2012 margin
guidance.”  In the U.S., Serco were selected by the U.S. Navy for two
contracts worth a total of $130 million, to provide logistics
support and hazardous materials management.  Serco had its biggest intra-day gain in almost three months
in London trading, adding 4.4 percent to 588 pence per share.
The stock has gained 10.5 percent this year, giving the company
a market value of 2.89 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
