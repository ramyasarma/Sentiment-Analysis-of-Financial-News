Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, sold $1.5 billion of notes
with corporate bond issuance on pace for a record November.  Borrowers from  Ally Financial Inc. , the biggest issuer of
junk-rated debt this year, to Newark, New Jersey-based 
Prudential Financial Inc.  have issued or are marketing at least
$6.72 billion of the securities in the U.S. today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Corporations have sold more than $69
billion of debt this month and are on track to surpass the
$124.7 billion issued in November 2006.  Issuance is accelerating, surpassing the 2010 average last
week for the ninth time in 10 weeks, as yields on corporate
bonds hover near record lows. Companies will take advantage of
“a great market for both investment-grade and high-yield
issuers” to sell debt through the Thanksgiving holiday in the
U.S. on Nov. 25, said  Scott MacDonald , head of credit and
economic research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC.  “You’re going to see a pretty good market for new issues
as companies decide it might be time to pre-finance maturities
if they think markets are going to be choppier,” said
MacDonald, who’s based in Stamford, Connecticut.  P&G’s offering was split between $1 billion of five-year
notes that yield 47 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of two-year floating-rate debt that
pays 4 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, according to a person familiar with the offering.  Three-month Libor is a lending benchmark set yesterday at
0.28 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Crest, Old Spice  The offering is Cincinnati-based P&G’s second in U.S.
dollars this year, following a $1.25 billion sale in February of
2.5-year notes that paid a 55 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show.  The maker of Crest toothpaste and Old Spice fragrances
reported profit in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30
declined 6.8 percent, exceeding some analysts’ estimates, after
it sold a pharmaceuticals unit and commodity costs rose.  P&G fell 4 cents, or 0.06 percent, to $64.29 as of 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 6 percent during the year.  The company is ranked Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
an equivalent AA- by Standard & Poor’s.  Ally Financial, the auto and home lender formerly known as
GMAC Inc., sold $1 billion of seven-year notes, Bloomberg data
show. The 6.25 percent debt yields 6.5 percent. The Detroit-
based company has sold $5.65 billion of notes in four sales in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prudential Bonds  Prudential Financial, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer
after MetLife Inc., sold $1 billion of notes to help pay for two
overseas units from American International Group Inc. The
company sold $500 million of 4.5 percent, 10-year notes that pay
a spread of 167 basis points and $500 million of 6.2 percent,
30-year bonds that yield 185 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds climbed to 3.75
percent on Nov. 12 after touching 3.53 percent, the lowest on
record, on Nov. 4, a day after the Federal Reserve announced
plans to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries as it
tries to stimulate the economy and stave off deflation,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Junk-debt yields climbed to 7.66 percent on Nov. 12 from
7.55 percent, the lowest since March 2005, on Nov. 9, the index
data show.  “Real economic growth is going to be slower in Europe and
may moderate here, we don’t know what’s going to happen on the
fiscal or taxation front, and there are still sovereign
issues,” MacDonald said. “There’s no magic wand to make these
things all go away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
