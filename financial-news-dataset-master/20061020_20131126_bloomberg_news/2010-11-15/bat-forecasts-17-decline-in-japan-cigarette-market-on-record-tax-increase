British American Tobacco Plc ,
Europe’s largest cigarette maker, forecasts a 17 percent decline
in the Japanese cigarette market next year after a record tax
increase in October.  The volume may total 180 billion cigarettes in 2011,
compared with an estimated 218 billion this year, according to a
presentation by  BAT ’s Japan unit in Tokyo. The market may
shrink to as low as 165 billion cigarettes next year, Naresh
Sethi, president of  BAT Japan , told reporters.  Japan raised the tobacco tax by 40 percent in October to
discourage smoking in the country, where 36.6 percent of men
smoke. The price of 20 cigarettes in Japan rose an average of 37
percent to 410 yen ($4.95) on Oct. 1, said  BAT , the maker of
Kent and Kool brands.  Sales “volume will suffer in a big way in 2011,” Sethi
said. The government should apply “a small increase every
year,” as it would make the market more predictable, he said.  An illegal cigarette market may emerge in Japan because of
rising prices, he said.  Cigarette sales plunged 70 percent in October after an 88
percent surge in September, according to the  Tobacco Institute
of Japan.  Thousands of smokers bought cigarette cartons at
convenience stores and other retailers before the tax took
effect. BAT increased its market share in Japan to 10.6 percent
so far this year, from 9.1 percent in 2005, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
