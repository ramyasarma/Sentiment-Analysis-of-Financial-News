Koenig & Bauer AG said it will look
at the possibility of paying a dividend for 2010, after

reaches its full-year targets. The German maker of printing
presses confirmed its forecast after narrowing its loss in the
first nine months of the year in an earnings report on its
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
