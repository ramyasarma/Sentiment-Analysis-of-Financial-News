Corn rose the most in three weeks
and soybeans rebounded as demand climbed from livestock
producers, food manufacturers and fuel makers following price
slumps last week.  U.S. exporters sold corn to South Korea and Egypt, and
soybeans and soybean oil to unknown destinations, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today. Argentina is in talks on
resuming corn exports to China. On Nov. 12, corn and soybean
futures tumbled the most allowed by the Chicago Board of Trade.  “Consumers are using the recent drop in prices as an
opportunity to buy ahead,” said  Doug Bergman , a grain broker at
Advantage Traders Group in Chicago. “Speculation that China may
be in the market to import corn is supportive.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 21 cents, or 3.8
percent, to close at $5.69 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since Oct. 20. On Nov. 12, the
contract tumbled 30 cents, or 5.2 percent, capping a 9.2 percent
drop in six sessions.  On Nov. 9, the most-active contract reached a 26-month high
of $6.175 after adverse weather reduced the size of the U.S.
crop.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 17.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to close at $12.865 a bushel. On Nov. 12, the price
plunged 70 cents, or 5.2 percent, after reaching $13.485, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Aug. 28, 2008.  The oilseed has gained 43 percent since the end of June as
China’s demand surged and hot, dry weather reduced U.S. yields.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of both
commodities, government figures show.  U.S. Crush  Soybean demand  from U.S. processors rose 22 percent in
October from September as farmers increased sales of newly
harvest crops. Users including Bunge Ltd. and Archer Daniels
Midland Co. crushed 151.8 million bushels, up from 124.9 million
a month earlier, the National Oilseed Processors Association
said today.  The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for 147.7 million. An estimated 155.2 million were
crushed a year earlier.  Domestic use had a “strong performance,”  Lewis Hagedorn ,
a commodity strategist at JP Morgan & Chase Co., said in a
report. “Today’s data supports our belief that the USDA’s full-
season crush forecast” of 1.665 billion bushels “remains
understated” by about 35 million, he said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
