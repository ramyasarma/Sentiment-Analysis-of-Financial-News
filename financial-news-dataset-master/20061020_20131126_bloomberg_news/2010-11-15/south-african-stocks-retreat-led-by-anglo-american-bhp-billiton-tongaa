South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  advanced for the third consecutive day, rising
123.81, or 0.4 percent, to 31,816.61 at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, added 2.41 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 339.40 rand, a third
day of gains. Anglo American said it will sell its Moly-Cop and
AltaSteel units to OneSteel Ltd., Australia’s second-largest
producer of the metal, for $932 million.  Astral Foods Ltd.  (ARL SJ), the nation’s second-largest
