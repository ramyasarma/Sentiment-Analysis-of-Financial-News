Israeli government bonds gained,
pushing yields on the benchmark 10-year note lower for the first
time in four days, amid speculation that recent declines
overstate concerns about inflation. The shekel strengthened.  The Consumer Price Index may increase to 2.5 percent in
October from 2.4 percent in September, according to the median
estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey. October
inflation data will be released at 6:30 p.m. in Jerusalem.  “There’s a bit of buying now as inflation is likely to
stay within the consensus,” said  Assaf Rosenberg , a trader at
Excellence Investments Ltd. in Ramat Gan, Israel. “The recent
rise in yields was quite dramatic.”  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 slipped 2 basis points to 4.53 percent at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv. The yield jumped to the highest level in
almost four months yesterday on speculation the central bank
will raise interest rates to curb inflation.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  increased the
benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to 2 percent in
September, citing a surge in housing prices. Inflation is
expected to accelerate to about 2.9 percent over the next 12
months, the central bank said Oct. 17.  While rising inflation expectations are a “matter of
concern,” there is no need for the central bank to act
immediately, Fischer said today on a conference call with
foreign journalists.  The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.6719 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
