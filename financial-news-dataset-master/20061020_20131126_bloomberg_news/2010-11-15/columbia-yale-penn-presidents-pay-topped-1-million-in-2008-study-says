Columbia University President  Lee Bollinger  was the Ivy League’s highest-paid president in 2008 at
$1.75 million in total compensation, as 30 college leaders
received more than $1 million in pay.  Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania joined
Columbia as Ivy League schools paying their top executive more
than $1 million, according to the  Chronicle of Higher Education .
The paper yesterday published a study of pay for presidents of
448 private, nonprofit U.S. colleges and universities.  The number of presidents making more than $1 million a year
rose from 23 in 2007. None was making that much as recently as
2004, according to the Chronicle. After 2008, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service changed some compensation reporting requirements
for colleges, including adjusting the time period surveyed to a
calendar year rather than a fiscal year. As a result,
comparisons to previous years can’t be made.  “Baby boomers make up the largest share of college
presidents and many will retire soon and see large payouts,”
according to a Chronicle statement. “With a large number of
retirements expected, boards are also competing against each
other for top talent to replace the retiring leaders, making
colleges more willing to cut deals in presidential contracts.”  Best Paid  Bollinger’s compensation consists of pay and benefits
including housing.  The highest-paid president in 2008 was  Touro College’s 
Bernard Lander, who made $4.8 million. Lander, an Orthodox
Jewish rabbi, founded New York-based Touro in 1970 and died on
Feb. 8 at age 94, according to the college’s website. His pay
included $4.2 million in deferred compensation and benefits,
according to the Chronicle.  The second-highest paid president in 2008 was  John Brazil ,
of  Trinity University  in San Antonio, who received $2.78 million
and retired in 2009. He was followed by R. Gerald Turner ,
president of  Southern Methodist University  in Dallas, who was
paid $2.77 million, which includes cashing out a life-insurance
policy, according to the Chronicle.  Among Ivy League presidents,  Richard Levin  of Yale, in New
Haven, Connecticut, was paid $1.53 million;  Amy Gutmann , of the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, made $1.37 million;
and  David Skorton , of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York,
who was paid $915,913 in 2008.  Ruth Simmons  of Brown University, in Providence, Rhode
Island, was paid $884,771;  Shirley Tilghman , of Princeton
University, in Princeton, New Jersey, made $881,151;  Drew Faust ,
of Harvard University, received $822,011; and  James Wright , the
now-retired president of Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New
Hampshire, got $687,404.  RPI Leader  Shirley Ann  Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, in Troy, New York, was the highest compensated
university leader in fiscal 2008, under the old IRS reporting
requirements. In calendar 2008, with the new requirements, her
pay of $1.66 million ranked ninth.  The Ivy League consists of eight private universities in
the Northeastern U.S.  Robert Zimmer , president of University of Chicago, got
$1.16 million;  John Hennessy , of Stanford University, near Palo
Alto, California, made $1.09 million; and  Susan Hockfield  of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology received $940,227.  The compensation figures are based on the most recently
available federal tax returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
