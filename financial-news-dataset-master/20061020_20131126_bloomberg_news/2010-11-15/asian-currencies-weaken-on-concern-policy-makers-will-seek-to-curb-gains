Asian currencies dropped, led by
Singapore’s dollar, on concern policy makers around the region
will unveil measures to curb inflows of funds to stem currency
gains.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  fell to the lowest
level in more than two weeks as growing concern over the
stability of Ireland’s finances spurred demand for safer assets.
Ireland’s cabinet hasn’t discussed seeking a rescue and the
country has no immediate need for cash, Enterprise Minister Batt
O’Keeffe said yesterday. Germany is pressing the nation to seek
aid before a Nov. 16 meeting of European finance ministers to
calm market volatility.  “Investors seem to be a bit risk-averse and are using
Ireland’s concern as an excuse to sell securities that have
risen sharply,”  Yuji Kameoka , a senior economist based in Tokyo
at the Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd, said. “There is some
concern Thailand and South Korea may introduce measures to
control capital flows.”  The Singapore dollar slumped 1.1 percent, the most since
January 2009, to S$1.3077 per dollar as of 4:11 p.m. local time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India’s rupee slid 0.9
percent to 45.2050 and Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 0.9 percent to
3.1395. The baht dropped 0.6 percent to 29.95.  Each one of Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies has gained
this year as overseas investors poured $51.5 billion into stocks
in India, South Korea and Taiwan. The Group of 20 leaders agreed
in Seoul last week to allow emerging markets to adopt regulatory
steps to cope with the surge in capital inflows, offering them
cover to limit currency gains.  Industrial Output  India’s rupee fell to its weakest level since Sept. 28
after the government reported the slowest growth in industrial
production in 16 months. Output at factories, utilities and
mines rose 4.4 percent in September from a year earlier, the
statistics office said Nov. 12.  The baht, which has advanced 11.2 percent this year, slid
for a fourth straight day. Southeast Asia’s second-biggest
economy last month removed a 15 percent tax exemption for
foreigners on income from domestic bonds, and Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said on Oct. 21 that the Bank of Thailand is
studying additional measures to reduce currency volatility.
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said on Nov. 12 he is “still
worried” about the baht’s appreciation.  Tax Revival  South Korea’s won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,131.81 per
dollar. Grand National Party lawmaker Kim Song Sik last week
submitted to parliament a bill to revive a 14 percent tax on
overseas investors’ bond holdings.  Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.5 percent to 8,968 per dollar.
The government is studying options to manage capital inflows,
including the possibility of taxing such funds, Agus Suprijanto,
acting head of fiscal policy at the Finance Ministry, said
today.  The Philippines will take steps to “ensure less
volatility” in the peso, President Benigno Aquino said on Nov.
12. There should be “concerted action,” he said.  Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan slid 0.2 percent to 6.6468,
while the Philippine peso was little changed at 43.75. Taiwan’s
dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$30.732.  To contact the reporter on this story:
