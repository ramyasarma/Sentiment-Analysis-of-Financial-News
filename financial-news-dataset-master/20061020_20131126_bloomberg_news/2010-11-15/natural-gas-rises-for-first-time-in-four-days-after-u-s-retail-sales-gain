Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in four days after data showed U.S. retail sales
climbed the most in seven months, a sign that the economic
recovery is accelerating.  Gas advanced as purchases rose 1.2 percent, the biggest
gain since March, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. A U.S. gas surplus to the five-year average fell to
9.8 percent in the week ended Nov. 5 from 10.2 percent the
previous week, according to the Energy Department.  “If consumers come back and start buying, it may have some
positive impacts on gas,” said  Carl Neill , an energy consultant
at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “We are near the bottom and
as winter weather comes in, storage will fall and markets will
move higher.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 4.6 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $3.845 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas has declined 31 percent
this year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
1,203.52 at 3:13 p.m. The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of
19 raw materials increased 0.8 percent to 306.01.  “With the stock market coming back up a little bit, the
gas market may be shaking off some of the storage pessimism that
we saw last week,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFG Best in
Chicago.  Independence Hub  Enterprise Products Partners LP’s Independence Hub in the
Gulf of Mexico was shut over the weekend for regular
maintenance, according to  Rick Rainey , a company spokesman. The
maintenance may last about five days, he said.  The hub can handle as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day,
according to the company.  Gas tumbled 9.8 percent in the past three days after it
settled on Nov. 9 at $4.21 per million Btu, the highest level in
almost 12 weeks.  "$4 is a formidable resistance point,” said  Tom Saal ,
senior vice president of energy trading at Hencorp Becstone
Futures in Miami.  U.S. gas stockpiles rose 19 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 5 to a record 3.84 trillion, the Energy Department
said last week.  The increase was smaller than the five-year average gain of
30 billion cubic feet, department data showed. A surplus to
year-earlier supplies narrowed to 0.8 percent from 1 percent.  Stockpile Estimate  Gas stockpiles  may total 1.776 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, up about 114 billion
cubic feet from a year earlier, according to Energy Department
estimates.  “U.S. gas supply growth has yet to hit a wall,” analysts
including  John Freeman  at Raymond James & Associates Inc. said
in a note today. Gas production will be more than 3 billion
cubic feet a day higher in 2011 from this year, they said.  Gross gas production in the lower 48 states rose 1.8
percent to 65.79 billion cubic feet a day in August, according
to the Energy Department’s monthly report known as EIA-914.  The report includes gas used for repressuring, quantities
vented and flared, and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating
or processing operations. Excluding those supplies, marketed gas
production will average 61.49 billion cubic feet a day this
year, the highest level since 1973, according to Energy
Department estimates.  Mild Weather  Gas fell in earlier trading as temperatures will be above
normal in the Northeast this week and across the Atlantic Coast
and Midwest next week, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda, Maryland.  “We have a lot of gas and no real cold weather to speak
of, and that just keeps the pressure on gas prices and keeps the
bulls on the sidelines,” said  Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke
Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky.  The weather phenomenon known as La Niña is pushing up
temperatures and it will be much warmer next week in the South,
Midwest, and East than forecast last week, according to MDA
Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.  New York will have a high of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16
Celsius) on Nov. 23, 9 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 5.94 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.5635 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
263,283 as of 3:14 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
265,000. Volume was 290,217 on Nov. 12. Open interest was
798,917 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
810,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
