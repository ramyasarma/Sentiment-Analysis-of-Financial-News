Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, will increase the additional charge on cathode sales
to Japan next year by 31 percent, the second straight annual
gain, as demand climbs in Asia.  The premium for grade A metal will rise to $98 a metric ton
from $75 this year, said three industry officials familiar with
the matter, asking not to be identified as the terms are private.
The fee is added to the price of  copper for immediate delivery 
on the London Metal Exchange to cover shipping and insurance.  Copper, used in pipes and wires, gained 16 percent this
year and reached a record $8,966 a ton in London on Nov. 11 as
demand led by China outpaced supply and as investors bought
commodities to protect their assets. The move by Codelco sets a
benchmark for other producers and may spur  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. ,  Pan Pacific Copper Co. , Sumitomo Metal
Mining Co. and Mitsubishi Materials Corp. to follow suit.  “The premium increase reflects brisk regional demand for
copper led by China amid tight supply,” said  Takashi Murata , an
analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. “Demand in Asia
appears stronger than other regions.”  The Chilean company will raise the fee to $98 a ton for
South Korea, the second-largest buyer in Asia, from $74 this
year, three industry executives with direct knowledge of the
matter said on Nov. 11. Codelco will also increase the fee in
Europe to $98 a ton from $80 this year, said a person with
direct knowledge of the matter on Oct. 12.  China Increase  “Given the premium increase in Japan and South Korea, the
charge for China will surpass the $100 level and may reach as
high as about $110,” Daiwa’s Murata said. The premium for China
was $85 a ton in 2010.  Copper will lead a rally in base metals into 2011 as
increased consumption cuts stockpiles and weaker currencies spur
investment demand for commodities, according to  Morgan Stanley .  The metal has the “potential to have a structural shortage
of supply for longer than any of the other metals,”  Peter Richardson , chief metals economist at Morgan Stanley Australia
Ltd., said Nov. 9. There’s been underinvestment in mine capacity
over the past decade and a “significant problem” of declining
ore quality, he said.  China’s  inflation  accelerated to 4.4 percent in October,
the fastest pace in two years. On Oct. 12, Codelco Chief
Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said he expects a “tighter”
copper market next year because of continued demand from China
and a lack of new supply.  Three-month delivery copper in London fell 1.1 percent to
$8,521.75 a ton at 4:35 p.m. Tokyo time. Copper  stockpiles  in
LME warehouses have fallen 28 percent this year and are heading
for their first annual drop in six years. Inventories stood at
362,775 tons as of Nov. 12, the lowest level since October 2009.  Refined-copper output will lag behind demand by 435,000
tons next year, the first shortage since 2007, according to the
International Copper Study Group.  To contact the reporters for this story:
