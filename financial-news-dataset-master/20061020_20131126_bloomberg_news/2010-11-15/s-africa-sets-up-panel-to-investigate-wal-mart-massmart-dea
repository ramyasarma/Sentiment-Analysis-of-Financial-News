South Africa’s government has set up
a panel to investigate the effects of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s 
proposal to buy a controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. ,
the country’s biggest food and general goods wholesaler.  The government will consider the transaction’s effect on
local manufacturing, competition, food security, labor relations
and exchange rates, Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel 
said in an e-mailed response to a parliamentary question today.  The panel will “identify the relevant policy issues and
implications of the proposed acquisition, particularly from an
economic development perspective,” said Patel, the former
leader of the country’s biggest clothing and textile workers’
union. “We will hold further discussions with the two
companies, Massmart and Walmart, as these processes unfold.”  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, on Sept. 27 made a
non-binding offer to purchase Massmart for 32 billion rand ($4.6
billion). Wal-Mart may make a “partial offer” for a
controlling stake in Massmart and is also considering retaining
its listing on the Johannesburg stock exchange, Massmart said in
an Oct. 28 regulatory filing.  The advisory panel’s members include Standard Bank Group
Ltd. chief economist Goolam Ballim and Industrial Development
Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Geoffrey Qhena .  To contact the reporter on this story:
