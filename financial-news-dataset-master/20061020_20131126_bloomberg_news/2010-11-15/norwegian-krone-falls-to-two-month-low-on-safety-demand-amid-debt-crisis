The Norwegian krone weakened to 6
per dollar for the first time in almost two months as concern
Europe’s debt crisis is deepening drove investors to seek assets
perceived to be lower risk.  The krone depreciated for a seventh straight day, its
longest run of losses since October 2008. European finance
chiefs meet tomorrow as Ireland is being pushed by the region’s
leaders to accept a bailout to stop the crisis from spreading.
Norway’s central bank said Oct. 27 it would delay plans to
resume monetary tightening until the middle of 2011 as it waits
for more signs of an economic recovery abroad.  “The dovish tone of the central bank is leaving the krone
vulnerable when we have risk aversion,” said  Niels Christensen ,
chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen.  The krone depreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 6.0071 per
dollar, its weakest level since Sept. 21, and was at 5.9870
against the U.S. currency at 4:29 p.m. in London. It
strengthened 0.1 percent versus the euro to 8.1433.  Sweden’s krona appreciated 0.5 percent to 9.3482 per euro,
and was 0.2 percent weaker against the dollar at 6.8798.  To contact the reporter on this story:
