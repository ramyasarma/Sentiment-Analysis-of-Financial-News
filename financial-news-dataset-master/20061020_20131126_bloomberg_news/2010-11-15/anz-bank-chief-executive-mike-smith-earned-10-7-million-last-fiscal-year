Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. , Australia’s third-largest lender, said Chief
Executive Officer  Mike Smith  was paid A$10.9 million ($10.7
million) last fiscal year, as politicians step up attacks on
banking profits.  Smith’s pay for the 12 months ended September 2010 was
little changed from the previous year and included shares, A$3
million in cash, and a bonus of A$2.5 million, according to the
Melbourne-based company’s  annual report , released today.  Australia’s biggest banks, led by Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, this month raised mortgage interest rates by more
than the central raised borrowing costs. Prime Minister Julia
Gillard has said such increases can’t be justified and is
working on measures to make it easier for customers to find
cheaper options.  “It’s time we stopped banks profiteering at the expense
of their customers,” Greens member  Adam Bandt  said today before
ANZ Bank’s report was released.  Smith’s pay was about 166 times the average annual salary
in Australia of A$65,300, according to the  Australian Bureau of
Statistics . Commonwealth Bank CEO  Ralph Norris  was paid A$16.2
million last fiscal year, according to the bank’s annual report
released in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
