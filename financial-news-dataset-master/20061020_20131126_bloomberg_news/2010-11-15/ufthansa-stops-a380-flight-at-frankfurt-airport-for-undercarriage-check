Deutsche Lufthansa AG  said one of
its Airbus SAS A380 jets aborted taxiing before takeoff from
Frankfurt airport after the pilot requested a check on the
plane’s undercarriage.  Preliminary checks on the front wheel didn’t find anything
out of order,  Thomas Jachnow , a spokesman for the Cologne,
Germany-based airline, said by phone. Passengers on the plane,
which was due to depart for Tokyo at 1.30 p.m. local time, were
shuttled back to the terminal and were set to board a
replacement A380 after a four-hour delay, he said.  The incident had no connection to the plane’s Rolls-Royce
Group Plc Trent 900 engines, Jachnow said, adding that
inspections over the weekend showed the turbines were fine.
Qantas Airways Ltd. grounded its fleet of six A380s after an
engine of the same build exploded in mid-flight on Nov. 4,
causing an emergency landing. Qantas, Singapore Airlines Ltd.
and Lufthansa all replaced engines on their A380s last week.  A Qantas Boeing Co. 747 bound for Buenos Aires returned to
Sydney after pilots saw smoke in the cockpit, a spokesman said
today, becoming at least the fourth flight turned around by the
carrier in less than two weeks. The plane landed safely and
there were no injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
