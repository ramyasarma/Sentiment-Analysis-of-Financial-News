Skymark Airlines Inc. , Japan’s
biggest low-cost carrier, gained in Tokyo trading after saying
it will use cash to purchase  Airbus SAS  A380s, allaying concerns
it may issue new shares to pay for the planes.  Shares gained by 150 yen, their daily limit, to 910 yen as
of the close of trading in Tokyo today. The company announced
the planned purchases after the market closed Nov. 12.  Skymark, whose shares plunged by their daily limit on Nov.
9 after the company announced plans to order four of the planes,
said it would finance its initial order of A380s through profits
and leasing. The carrier, which currently flies scheduled
domestic services using 15 all-economy  Boeing Co.  737 planes,
may introduce 15 Airbus A380s in total, the company said.  “Investors are relieved that Skymark isn’t planning to
finance the planes through equity,” said  Seiichiro Samejima , an
analyst at Ichiyoshi Research Institute Inc. “If all goes well,
the carrier may be able to finance future purchases of Airbus
A380s through cash flow as well.”  Skymark will take delivery of its first superjumbos from
the fiscal year starting April 2014 and plans to fly to London,
Frankfurt and New York, among others, President  Shinichi Nishikubo  told reporters in Tokyo on Nov. 12. The carrier will
fit the superjumbos with 394 seats, divided between business and
premium-economy classes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
