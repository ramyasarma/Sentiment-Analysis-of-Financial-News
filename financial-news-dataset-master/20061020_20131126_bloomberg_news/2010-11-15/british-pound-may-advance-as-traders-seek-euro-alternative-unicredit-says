Britain’s pound may strengthen as
investors seek protection against a deepening of Europe’s debt
crisis, UniCredit SpA said.  “Since the market worries about the Irish banking sector
and its possible implications for the 2011 Irish budget started
to intensify again, this weighed on the euro much more than on
the pound,”  Stephan Maier , a foreign-exchange strategist in
Milan, said today in an e-mailed response to questions. “Going
into sterling, European investors, although theoretically
remaining in the European Union, are hedging themselves against
euro-zone-specific risks.”  Sterling’s role as a hedge may be amplified, pushing it
toward 84 pence per euro and $1.62, analysts including Maier
said in an e-mailed note to investors today.  The pound was little changed at 84.94 pence per euro and
slid 0.3 percent to $1.6074 as of 8:20 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
