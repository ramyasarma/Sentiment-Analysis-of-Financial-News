Metorex Ltd. , a copper and cobalt
producer in Africa, said output at its Ruashi mine in the
Democratic Republic of Congo has been curbed by recurring
electrical faults.  “One transformer circuit continues to run normally while
the other circuit is currently offline,” the Johannesburg-based
company said today in a statement. “The Ruashi tank house is
operating at a reduced throughput of 50 percent.”  It’s the latest setback for the Ruashi operation in the
southeastern Katanga province after higher-than-projected
investment costs during its development resulted in the need to
raise extra funds and delay output. Metorex expects the current
interruption to affect production for about five weeks.  Metorex  has dropped 3.4 percent over the past week in
Johannesburg, and traded down 1.2 percent at 4.83 rand at 5 p.m.
local time today, the lowest closing price since Nov. 4.  The company is feeding higher-grade cobalt ore to the
Ruashi plant to mitigate the effect of the circuit shutdown,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
