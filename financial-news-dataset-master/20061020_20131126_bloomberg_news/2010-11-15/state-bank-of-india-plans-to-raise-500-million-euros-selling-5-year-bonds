State Bank of India, the nation’s
largest lender, plans to raise 500 million euros ($681 million)
selling bonds, Deputy Managing Director  Pratip Chaudhuri  said in
an interview today.  The bank will sell the five-year debt next week, Chaudhuri
said. “The bonds will be senior debt with a bullet repayment,”
he said.  Indian companies have sold $7.5 billion of dollar bonds
this year, nearing a record $9.3 billion raised in 2007. State
Bank last sold euro-denominated notes in 2005 when it raised 100
million euros.  The bank will meet investors in Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Milan, Munich, Paris, Vienna and Zurich from
Nov. 17, Chaudhuri said. Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas SA,
Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG,  Standard Chartered Plc 
and UBS AG are arranging the meetings.  The  difference  between the 10-year Indian government bond
yield and that of similar maturity U.S. Treasuries widened to
521 basis points from 375 basis points at the start of the year.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
