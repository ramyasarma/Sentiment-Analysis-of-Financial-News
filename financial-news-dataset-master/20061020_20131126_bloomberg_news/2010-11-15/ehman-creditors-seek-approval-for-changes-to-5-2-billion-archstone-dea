Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
creditors asked a judge to approve a third restructuring of the
defunct firm’s biggest real-estate asset and said Lehman should
be able to make “further modifications” without asking the
court.  Apartment-complex owner Archstone’s $5.2 billion bailout,
arranged in May, is still being negotiated with lenders, Lehman
said earlier this month as it asked a judge to let it convert
more of its loans to equity. Creditors “are well positioned to
assess whether additional modifications require further
consideration by the court,” Lehman creditors said in Nov. 12
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy court in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
