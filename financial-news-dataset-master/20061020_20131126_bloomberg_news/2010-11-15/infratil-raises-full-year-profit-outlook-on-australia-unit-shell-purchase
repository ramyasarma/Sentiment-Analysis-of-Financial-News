Infratil Ltd. , a New Zealand
investor in energy and transport companies, raised its full-year
operating earnings forecast after the purchase of a new business
and profit rose at its Australian units.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and the
revaluation of financial assets will be NZ$415 million ($320
million) to NZ$435 million in the year ending March 31, the
Wellington-based company said in a statement. In August the
company forecast a range of NZ$390 million to NZ$430 million.  Infratil said profits from its Australian energy business,
which generates and sells electricity, surged in the six months
through September as winter demand increased. In March, Infratil
agreed to buy a half share in Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s New
Zealand fuel-retailing assets, which are likely to generate
NZ$30 million of operating profit for the full year.  Operating earnings increased 24 percent to NZ$258 million
in the six months ended Sept. 30 from NZ$207 million a year
earlier, the company said today. First-half revenue rose 11
percent to NZ$1.07 billion.  Net income was NZ$16 million in the six months through
September compared with a loss of NZ$31 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
