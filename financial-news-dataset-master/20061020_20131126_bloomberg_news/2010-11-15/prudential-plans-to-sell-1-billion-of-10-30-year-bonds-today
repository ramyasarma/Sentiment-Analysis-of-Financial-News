Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, plans to sell $1 billion of
debt as soon as today to help pay for two overseas units from
 American International Group Inc.   Prudential may issue $500 million each of 10- and 30-year
bonds, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The
10-year notes may yield 167 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, and the 30-year bonds may pay a spread of
185 basis points, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  The insurer is tapping the corporate bond market after
raising about $1 billion from a stock sale on Nov. 12. Newark,
New Jersey-based Prudential agreed Sept. 30 to buy AIG’s Star
Life Insurance Co. and Edison Life Insurance Co., two Japanese
businesses, for $4.8 billion. Prudential reduced the size of
stock and bond sales that it planned to pay for the deal by
increasing the cash component.  “When the deal came out, the view we had was they were not
using as much of their excess capital and adding more financing
to the transaction,” said  Randy Binner , an insurance analyst at
FBR Capital Markets. “It kind of cut into the accretion of the
deal somewhat and brought up more subjective questions about how
much capital was excess at Pru.”  Accretion refers to an increase in a company’s earnings
from an acquisition. Prudential previously said it would fund
the purchase with $1.7 billion of capital and by selling $1.3
billion of equity and $1.2 billion of debt. It  announced Nov. 3 
that it would reduce the stock and bond sales to $1 billion each
and use $2.2 billion of cash.  Last Benchmark Sale  By using more cash to fund the deal, and boosting its
annual dividend 64 percent to $1.15 a share, its highest payout
since 2007, Prudential “sent the market a signal that they’re
more prepared to return some of the excess capital buffer,”
said Binner, who recommends buying Prudential stock.  Prudential last sold debt in benchmark size on June 16,
issuing $1 billion of securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  The insurer issued $650 million of 5.375 percent, 10-year
debt, and $350 million of 6.625 percent, 30-year bonds,
Bloomberg data show. The 10-year notes traded on Nov. 10 at
109.662 cents on the dollar to yield 152.8 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. are
managing today’s debt sale, said the person familiar with the
offering.  MetLife Inc.  is the biggest U.S. life insurer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
