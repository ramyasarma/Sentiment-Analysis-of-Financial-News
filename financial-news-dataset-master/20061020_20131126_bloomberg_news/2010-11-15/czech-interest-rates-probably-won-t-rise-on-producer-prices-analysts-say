Czech policy makers probably won’t
accelerate interest-rate increases after producer-price growth
jumped to a two-year high in October as the economy is not
creating consumer inflation pressures.  Factory-gate  prices, an early gauge of inflation trends,
advanced 2.6 percent from a year earlier, the fastest growth
since October 2008, the Prague-based statistics office said
today on its  website . September producer-price inflation was 2.4
percent. Prices were unchanged on the month in October.  The central bank left the benchmark  two-week  repurchase
rate at a record low 0.75 percent on Nov. 4 and signaled
borrowing costs may start increasing near the end of next year.
Consumer price inflation was 2 percent in October, matching the
central bank’s target.  “Central bankers will be cautious about raising rates
because of the risk of a renewed recession in the euro zone and
uncertain global outlook,”  Jiri Skop , an analyst at Komercni
Banka AS in Prague said in a report.  Inflation pressures are currently “negligible” and
expectations of future price growth are “well anchored,” the
central bank said on Nov. 12, adding there was no need to change
interest rates at present.  “Capacity usage in the domestic economy remains low enough
not to generate any price pressures, inflation is thus mainly
imported or related to weather conditions,” said  David Marek ,
chief economist at Patria Finance, a Prague-based unit of KBC
Securities Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
