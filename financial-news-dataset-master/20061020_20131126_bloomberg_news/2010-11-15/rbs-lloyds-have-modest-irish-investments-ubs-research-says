Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc ’s holdings of Irish loans and
sovereign debt are “no more than a modest challenge” for the
U.K. government-backed banks, according to research by UBS AG.  The lenders have “minimal” amounts of Irish government
bonds and primarily invest in Ireland through residential
mortgages, UBS said in an e-mail to clients today. RBS’s gross
investments in Ireland total 35 billion pounds ($56 billion),
compared with 27 billion pounds at Lloyds, according to UBS.  “With pre-impairment group profits at each bank north of
13 billion pounds and capital bases robust, we see Ireland as no
more than a modest challenge for the banks,” UBS said.  Ireland is in talks with its European neighbors about
current “market conditions” after its bonds plummeted last
week as investors speculated the nation may follow Greece into
bankruptcy. RBS mainly lends to Irish consumers through its
Ulster Bank division and Lloyds’s Irish loan book was acquired
after its purchase of HBOS Plc.  Each bank has between 4 billion pounds and 5 billion pounds
of reserves against their Irish loan books, UBS said.  The Irish government has made no application for external
support and the country is “fully funded” into next year, a
Finance Ministry spokesman said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
