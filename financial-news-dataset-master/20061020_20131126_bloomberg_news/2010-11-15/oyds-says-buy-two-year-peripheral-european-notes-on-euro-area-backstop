Lloyds Banking Group Plc advised
investors to buy two-year notes issued by so-called peripheral
euro-area nations because the debt will mature before the
European Financial Stability Facility backstop expires.  “The EFSF guarantees financing until mid-2013 with no
European pressure to restructure over this period,” London-
based strategists  Charles Diebel  and  David Page  wrote today in
an investor report. “We therefore advocate taking long
positions in two-year peripheral debt versus the equivalent
German bond.”  Irish two-year notes rose a third day, sending the yield
down 33 basis points to 6.56 percent as of 9:20 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
