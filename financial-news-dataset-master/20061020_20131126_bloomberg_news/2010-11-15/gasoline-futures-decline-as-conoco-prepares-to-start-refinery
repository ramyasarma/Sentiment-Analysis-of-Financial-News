Gasoline futures fell, reversing an
earlier gain, amid speculation that  ConocoPhillips  is nearing
the restart of its Bayway refinery in New Jersey after
maintenance that started in September.  ConocoPhillips was preparing to restart a crude unit at its
Bayway refinery in New Jersey, two people with knowledge of the
plans said Nov. 12. The refinery is warming up a furnace
associated with the unit, said one of the people. Irving Oil
Corp. said today all units that underwent repairs except one
have been restarted at its Saint John plant in New Brunswick.  “We started selling off from the highs, after news came
out Conoco is expected to restart in 24 to 72 hours,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold
Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Gasoline for December delivery fell 1.49 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.195 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices touched $2.2489 earlier.  The profit for turning crude oil into gasoline, or the
crack spread, based on December contracts, fell 61 cents to
$7.33 a barrel.  Prices rose earlier on concern supplies would tighten amid
the maintenance at the Conoco and Irving plants, as well as work
on Hess Corp.’s fluid catalytic cracker in Port Reading, New
Jersey, and units at Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery.  Fuel Stockpiles  Stockpiles of gasoline fell 1.92 million barrels to 210.3
million, the lowest level since November 2009, the Energy
Department said Nov. 10. Distillate stockpiles dropped 4.97
million barrels, the most since February 2007.  “Over the last two months we have had a fairly substantial
drawdown in gasoline inventories,” said  Sander Cohan , an
analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “That’s putting bullish pressure on gasoline
prices.”  Heating oil for December delivery added 0.77 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.3709. The crack spread, based on December
contracts, widened 35 cents to $14.72 a barrel.  Demand for  distillate  fuel, which includes heating oil and
diesel, rose 7 percent in the week ended Nov. 5, the Energy
Department reported Nov. 10. Averaged over four weeks,
consumption was 16 percent above a year earlier.  “You do see signs that diesel demand is improving in the
United States,” said McGillian. “The Asian emerging market
demand is pretty good.”  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $2.892 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
