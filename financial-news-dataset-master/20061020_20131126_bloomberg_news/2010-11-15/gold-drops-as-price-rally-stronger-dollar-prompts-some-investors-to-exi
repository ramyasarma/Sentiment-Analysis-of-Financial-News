Gold may decline in New York as a
stronger dollar curbs demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  The dollar gained against the euro before European finance
chiefs meet tomorrow amid concern Ireland needs a bailout. Gold
usually moves inversely to the greenback and reached a record
$1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9. Futures lost 2.7 percent on Nov.
12, the most since July 1, as speculation that China may tighten
monetary policy to cool inflation sparked a commodity selloff.  “The market continues to trade alongside the single
currency,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital
in London. “In the long run, gold is still looking positive,
also in case fears in the euro zone escalate. Once the dust
settles, there will be plenty of willing buyers happy to move in
on new lows.”  Gold futures for December delivery lost $4.30, or 0.3
percent, to $1,361.20 an ounce at 8:25 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.5 percent
lower at $1,361.65. It reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9.  Germany is pressing Ireland to seek aid before tomorrow’s
meeting of European finance ministers to calm market volatility
and win agreement on making investors help pay for future
bailouts, according to a German government official who declined
to be identified because the talks are private. Irish Enterprise
Minister  Batt O’Keeffe  said a bailout hasn’t been discussed and
rejected the assertion that there is a “crisis.”  Silver Declines  European Central Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio  said
Ireland could tap the European Union’s rescue fund to bail out
its banking system. Constancio also said at an event in Vienna
today that Greece may have to introduce additional measures to
meet its budget targets for next year.  Silver for December delivery in New York lost 0.3 percent
to $25.875 an ounce after tumbling 5.3 percent on Nov. 12. The
price reached a 30-year high of $29.34 last week and is up 54
percent this year.  Palladium for December delivery added 0.1 percent to
$674.20 an ounce and platinum for January delivery was 0.6
percent lower at $1,674.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
