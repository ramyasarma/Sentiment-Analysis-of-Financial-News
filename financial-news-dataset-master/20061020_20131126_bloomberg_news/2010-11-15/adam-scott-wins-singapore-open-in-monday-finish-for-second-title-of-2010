Adam Scott  won the Singapore Open by
three shots to take his second golf title of 2010.  Australia’s Scott carded a 3-under-par 68 in the final
round at Sentosa Golf Club to finish 17-under-par, three ahead
of Denmark’s  Anders Hansen . The $6 million tournament was
extended to a Monday finish following thunderstorms yesterday.  Scott’s third title in Singapore lifted him to seven
European Tour victories. His other win this year came at the
Valero Texas Open in May, his first U.S. PGA Tour victory for
more than two years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
