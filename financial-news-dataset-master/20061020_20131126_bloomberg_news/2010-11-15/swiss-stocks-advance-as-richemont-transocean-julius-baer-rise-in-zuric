Stocks in Switzerland advanced,
sending the benchmark Swiss Market Index higher for the first
day in five, as companies from Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and
Transocean Ltd. to Julius Baer Group Ltd. gained.  The SMI of the biggest and most actively traded Swiss
companies rose 0.3 percent to 6,523.44 at 12:31 p.m. in Zurich.
The measure shed 1.3 percent last week amid renewed concern that
some of Europe’s most indebted countries will struggle to reduce
their budget deficits. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
added 0.3 percent today.  Richemont, the world’s largest jewelry maker, rallied 1.3
percent after Deutsche Bank AG recommended buying the stock.
Transocean and Julius Bear both climbed 1.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
