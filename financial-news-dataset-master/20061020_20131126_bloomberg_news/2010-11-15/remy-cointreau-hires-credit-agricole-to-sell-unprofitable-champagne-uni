Remy Cointreau SA , the maker of Remy
Martin cognac, said it hired Credit Agricole-CIB to find a buyer
for its unprofitable champagne division.  A sale will be subject to the necessary procedures in
accordance with current regulations, the Paris-based distiller
said today in a statement that was confirmed by spokeswoman
 Joelle Jezequel .  Remy’s champagne unit, whose brands include  Piper-Heidsieck 
and Charles Heidsieck, posted an operating loss of 4 million
euros in the 12 months through March, the company said in June.
Sales declined 24 percent in the period. Remy said Feb. 5 that
it would cut 45 jobs at the unit to counter the slump.  The shares rose as much as 1.1 euros, or 2.1 percent, to
53.30 euros and traded at 52.85 euros as of 1:56 p.m. in Paris.
The stock has gained 48 percent this year, giving Remy a market
value of 2.56 billion euros ($3.5 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
