Former Bank of England policy maker
 David Blanchflower  said a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  urging him to halt an expansion of monetary stimulus
is “dangerous politics” and displays “very little
understanding” of the economy.  The letter-writers are “playing with an economy that’s
fragile,” Blanchflower, a professor at Dartmouth College, said
in an interview with Bloomberg Television today. “Thank
goodness” the Fed hasn’t “listened to these folks who would
drive us back into recession and probably a depression.”  A group including former Republican government officials
and economists urged Bernanke in a letter to stop his expansion
of monetary easing, saying it risks an inflation surge.  The missive will be published in tomorrow’s editions of the
Wall Street Journal and New York Times, said Jennifer Pollom, a
spokeswoman for Economics 21, a Washington research group whose
logo is on the letterhead.  “These folks are advocating cutting fiscal spending at a
time when you should be adding stimulus,” Blanchflower said.
“The Fed has to compensate for what these folks advocate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
