Japanese 10-year  bonds  rose for the
second time in three days as stocks dropped and a report showed
demand for services slid in September, increasing demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Benchmark securities also gained as  yields  near the highest
level in nine weeks attracted investors. Bond futures advanced
after a technical indicator signaled that their biggest slide in
10 weeks yesterday was excessive.  “Yields have risen to an attractive level,” said  RuiXue Xu , a strategist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., one of the 24
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “Bond
yields are unlikely to rise” in part because Japan’s economic
recovery isn’t strong.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell two basis
points to 1.03 percent as of 4:20 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 advanced 0.178 yen to 99.732.
The yield earlier reached 1.09 percent, the most since Sept. 15.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.37 to
142.39 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That was
the biggest gain since Oct. 6.  Bond futures dropped 0.57 yesterday, the steepest slide
since Sept. 6, pushing the 14-day relative strength index to 31.
Some traders see the level of 30 or lower as an indication
declines in an asset are overdone.  “The rebound in futures was apparently triggered by short-
sellers who unwound their positions by buying,” said  Koji Ochiai , chief market economist at Mizuho Investors Securities
Co., another primary dealer.  ‘Pausing’ Recovery  Japan’s  tertiary index , a measure of demand for services,
fell 0.9 percent from a month earlier, the Trade Ministry said
today. Economists had estimated a 0.5 percent decline.  The government will leave its assessment of Japan’s economy
unchanged, the Yomiuri newspaper today reported. The monthly
report due Nov. 19 will say that the recovery is “pausing,”
according to the newspaper.  Gains in bonds were limited as concern eased that a
stronger currency will hurt exporters’ earnings.  The yen traded at 83.08 per dollar after falling to 83.27
yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 6. A weaker yen helps
reduce the price of Japanese goods sold abroad and increases the
value of export revenue when repatriated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
