California  began offering $10
billion of one-year notes to investors today with tentative
yields ranging from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, according to two
people familiar with the offering.  Investors are being offered $2 billion of notes maturing in
May at yields from 1 percent to 1.25 percent, or from 58 to 83
basis points more than  top-rated one-year municipal bonds  as of
Nov. 12, according to Municipal Market Advisors data. Investors
who were being offered $8 billion of notes maturing in June were
quoted 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, or about 83 to 108 basis
points more than top-rated notes.  The state will take orders today and tomorrow from
individual investors for revenue anticipation notes, short-term
municipal bonds known as RANs that the state offers when cash is
low and repays from later tax collections. Institutional
investors such as mutual funds will place orders Nov. 17.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  will manage the sale, along with De La
Rosa & Co. and Wells Fargo Securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
