India’s rupee fell to its weakest
level in more than seven weeks on concern inflows of funds into
the nation’s assets will moderate after the government reported
the slowest growth in industrial production in 16 months.  Output  at factories, utilities and mines rose 4.4 percent
in September from a year earlier, the smallest increase since
May 2009, the statistics office said Nov. 12. The median
estimate of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
6.4 percent gain. Overseas investors pumped $373 million into
Indian shares in the four days through Nov. 11, following net
purchases of $3.3 billion the previous week, exchange data show.  “The negative effects of weak industrial production on
inflows will be there in the short run,” said A.Y. Shedshale,
deputy general manager at Bank of Maharashtra in Mumbai. “The
impact on the rupee is likely to be temporary.”  The local currency declined 1 percent to 45.24 per dollar
as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai. It touched 45.2475, the
weakest level since Sept. 24. The rupee has gained 2.9 percent
this year as overseas investors pumped  $28.5 billion  into Indian
equities, driving the benchmark  Sensex  index to a record close
this month.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.92 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.43 on Friday.
