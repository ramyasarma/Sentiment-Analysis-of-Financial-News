More than half of  New York  state
voters oppose spending cuts in education or health care, “even
if it means raising taxes,” according to a Siena Research
Institute  poll .  Governor-elect  Andrew Cuomo , who faces a $9 billion budget
gap next year, “is going to have his work cut out for him”
said Siena pollster  Steven Greenberg . Opposition among
legislators to spending cuts delayed approval of this year’s
budget until August, four months after the start of the fiscal
year.  Cuomo was elected Nov. 2 with 61 percent of the vote after
campaigning on promises to freeze taxes and state workers’
salaries. He is required to submit a budget by Feb. 1 for the
fiscal year that begins April 1.  At a press conference last week, Cuomo, a Democrat,
repeated his opposition to raising taxes and said details about
spending cuts and the redesign of state programs would be part
of his first budget.  Governor  David Paterson , also a Democrat, wants lawmakers
to return to Albany before Cuomo takes office Jan. 1, to close a
$315 million gap in this year’s budget.  The 52 percent of voters opposed to spending cuts in the
two largest parts of the state budget, education and health
care, “is consistent with polls in February and March, during
this year’s budget season,” Greenberg said in a telephone
interview.  The telephone survey of 802 registered voters by
Loudonville-based Siena was conducted Nov. 8-10 and has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
