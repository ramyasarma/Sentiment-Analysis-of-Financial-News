PZU SA , Poland’s largest insurer,
said third-quarter profit dropped 21 percent as a record
dividend reduced its capital and hurt investment income.  Net income declined to 704.3 million zloty ($244.1 million)
from 892 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based company
said in a regulatory statement. That compares with the 688.5
million-zloty  average estimate  of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Net income on investments, including interest on bonds,
slid 30 percent to 395.9 million zloty in the three months ended
Sept. 30, while revenue from sales of shares in which PZU
invested slumped 71 percent to 34 million zloty, the company
said. The value of the stocks held by the insurer rose 27
percent.  PZU, which debuted on the Warsaw stock market in May and
overtook  Vienna Insurance Group AG  as central Europe’s largest
publicly traded insurer by market value, had its capital cut by
a record dividend of 12.8 billion zloty, part of the settlement
of an ownership dispute between the Polish government and Eureko
BV. Profit at Vienna Insurance, whose capital is more than twice
that of PZU, rose 14 percent in the same period to 94.5 million
euros ($129 million).  Gross premiums were little changed at 3.55 billion zloty in
the quarter, compared with 3.57 billion zloty a year earlier.
Compensation paid to clients rose 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
