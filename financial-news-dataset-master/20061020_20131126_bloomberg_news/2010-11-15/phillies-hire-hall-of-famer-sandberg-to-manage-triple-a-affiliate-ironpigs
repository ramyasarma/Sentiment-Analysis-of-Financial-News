Hall of Famer  Ryne Sandberg  was
hired by the Philadelphia Phillies to manage their Triple-A
affiliate after the former second baseman was overlooked by the
Chicago Cubs.  Sandberg, 51, will manage the Lehigh Valley  IronPigs  of the
International League, the Phillies said in a news release.  Sandberg managed in the Cubs’ minor-league system for the
last four seasons. In 2010 he led Triple-A Iowa to a tie for the
best record in Pacific Coast League’s Northern Division, earning
the league’s Manager of the Year Award.  He was a candidate for the Cubs’ manager job this offseason
after  Lou Piniella  announced his retirement in August. That job
was given to  Mike Quade , who took over for Piniella on an
interim basis to close out the season.  Sandberg was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of
Fame in 2005 after a 16-year Major League Baseball career that
concluded in 1997.  He was drafted by the Phillies in the 20th round of the
1978 amateur draft, playing 13 games for the major-league club
in 1981 before being traded with  Larry Bowa  to the Cubs for  Ivan de Jesus .  Sandberg won nine straight Gold Gloves from 1983-1991 and
was the National League Most Valuable Player in 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
