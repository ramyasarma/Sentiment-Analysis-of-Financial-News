German property company  TAG
Immobilien AG  offered to buy  Colonia Real Estate AG , a Cologne-
based competitor, for about 174 million euros ($237 million).  TAG said it will pay 5.55 euros for each Colonia share,
according to a statement today. That’s 6.4 percent more than the
closing price on Nov. 12.  The acquisition would create a company with assets under
management of more than 4.3 billion euros, TAG said. The
Hamburg-based company plans to finance the transaction by
selling as many as 11.6 million new shares to institutional
investors and as much as 70 million euros in convertible bonds.  “We hope to be able to reduce vacancy and lower costs at
Colonia as well and thereby increase the value of the
properties,” TAG Chief Executive Officer  Rolf Elgeti  said.  Colonia noted TAG’s statement and said it would comment
further after TAG publishes the offer documents, according to a
separate statement today.  Colonia climbed as much as 7.5 percent in Frankfurt trading
to 5.56 euros, the highest since Sept. 9, 2008. The shares were
up 32.5 cents, or 6.3 percent, at 5.50 euros at 11:47 a.m. TAG’s
shares were 4 cents higher at 6.15 euros.  TAG already owns more than 21 percent of Colonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
