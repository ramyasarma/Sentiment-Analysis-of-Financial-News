The last track for the high-speed
rail line from Beijing to Shanghai was laid into place
yesterday, the China Daily reported.  The project is in its “last stage,” the newspaper cited
Lu Chunfang, vice minister of railways, as saying at a ceremony.
Workers will now install the railway’s power supply,
communications and signal systems, according to the report.  The railway will reduce travel time between Beijing and
Shanghai by train to four hours from 10 hours, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
