The floods that struck Pakistan
starting in July have “led to a sharp deterioration in the
economic outlook,” the International Monetary Fund said today
in a statement released in Washington.  “The agriculture sector, which accounts for 21 percent of
GDP and nearly half of employment, has been hit particularly
hard. There has also been substantial damage to infrastructure
and private property,” according to the IMF statement.  The IMF said Pakistan “will continue to have large gross
external financing requirements in the next few years. The
floods have added to these needs.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
