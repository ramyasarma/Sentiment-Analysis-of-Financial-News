Cotton futures fell for the fourth
straight session on concern that increased borrowing costs and
record prices may erode demand in China, the world’s biggest
consumer. Orange juice slumped.  China’s central bank may boost interest rates within weeks
in a bid to cool inflation, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Last week, the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials fell 3.2 percent, the most since early July, on
bets that growth will cool in the Asian country. Before today,
cotton tumbled 12 percent since touching a record on Nov. 10.  “At these kinds of price levels, you can have bubbles
under the market where you actually don’t have any buyers,”
said  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf and Sid Love
Consulting Services LLC in Overland Park, Kansas. “People are
getting out.”  Cotton futures for March delivery declined 2.99 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $1.3119 a pound at 10:17 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. The commodity lost 5.7 percent last week, the
most since the week ended June 4.  The fiber climbed to $1.5195 on Nov. 10, the highest price
since trading began 140 years ago. Futures surged on concern
that shrinking global supplies wouldn’t meet demand from Chinese
textile mills. Adverse weather damaged crops in China, Pakistan
and the U.S. earlier this year.  ‘Significant Top’  The record “high is looking increasingly as a significant
top, if not the top of this entire move,”  Sharon Johnson , a
senior analyst at First Capitol Group LLC in Atlanta, said in a
note on Nov. 12.  U.S. export sales of  upland cotton  totaled 432,236 bales
for the week ended Nov. 4, down 19 percent from the previous
six-week average, the Department of Agriculture said on Nov. 12.  Stockpiles  held in warehouses monitored by ICE rose 97
percent last week to 37,086 bales. As of Nov. 7, 71 percent of
the U.S. crop was harvested, according to the USDA.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery lost 0.8 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $1.552 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
