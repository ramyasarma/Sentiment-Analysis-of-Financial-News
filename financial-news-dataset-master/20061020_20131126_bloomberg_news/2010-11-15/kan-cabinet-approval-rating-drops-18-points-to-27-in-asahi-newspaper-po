Japanese public approval of Prime
Minister Naoto Kan’s cabinet fell 18 points to 27 percent from a
month earlier, according to an Asahi newspaper poll, which
attributed the decline to the administration’s handling of
relations with China and Russia. The Asahi said it surveyed
3,321 adults on Nov. 13 and 14, and obtained responses from 59
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
