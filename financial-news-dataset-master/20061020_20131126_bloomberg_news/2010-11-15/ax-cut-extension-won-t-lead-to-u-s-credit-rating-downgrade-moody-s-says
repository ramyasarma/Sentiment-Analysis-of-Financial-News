Moody’s Investors Service Inc. said
a permanent extension of tax cuts first enacted under the
administration of President George W. Bush won’t lead to a
downgrade in the U.S. credit rating.   “We have a Aaa outlook for the U.S that is stable and we
are not contemplating changing anything anytime soon, that is
the bottom line,” Steven Hess, senior credit officer at Moody’s
in New York, said in an interview today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
