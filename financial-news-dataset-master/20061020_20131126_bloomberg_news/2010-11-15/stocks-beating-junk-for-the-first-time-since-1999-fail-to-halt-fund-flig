U.S. stocks are  returning  more than
junk bonds after trailing them for a decade, valuations have
fallen to a record low compared with credit -- and investors are
pulling more money than ever out of equity funds.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 17 percent including
dividends since June, compared with 10 percent for the  Barclays
Capital U.S. Corporate High Yield Index . The equity gauge is on
pace for its biggest six-month gain against the bond index since
1999, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At the same time, the
more than 120 percent rally in junk bonds since 1998 has left
them more expensive than ever versus stocks, based on earnings
yields measuring annual profits as a percentage of price.  “People have pushed the trade too far,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.8 billion at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati. “The next step is to move from fixed
instruments into stocks. Junk bonds have so little premium right
now. It’s like the last chapter where people are finally going
to capitulate.”  Individuals are  ignoring  the advice, pulling $55.3 billion
from stock mutual funds since the end of June after $11 trillion
was erased from U.S. equity values between October 2007 and
March 2009. Third-quarter withdrawals came as the S&P 500 rose
11 percent, the first time a three-month advance failed to spur
investments, according to LPL Financial Corp. in Boston.  Favoring Stocks  Huntington, PNC Wealth Management and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. say stocks will beat speculative-grade debt as the economy
improves. S&P 500 per-share  earnings  are poised to rise 37
percent in 2010, the biggest  increase  in 22 years, estimates
from more than 10,000 analysts tracked by Bloomberg show.  The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent to 1,204.90 as of 11:39 a.m.
in New York.  The benchmark index for American equities fell 2.2 percent
to 1,199.21 last week as profits from Cisco Systems Inc. in San
Jose, California, and Burbank, California-based Walt Disney Co.
trailed analysts’ estimates. S&P 500 earnings that beat
 forecasts  more than 70 percent of the time have helped push the
gauge up 7.5 percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stocks remain cheap compared with bonds even after the
rally. Debt rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BBB- by S&P pays an average yield of 7.25 percent, compared with
an earnings yield of 6.64 percent for the S&P 500, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That’s the smallest gap since the Barclays
index began in 1991.  ‘Overweight’ Rating  Goldman Sachs in New York advised clients last month to
begin raising the proportion of equities they own relative to
debt, citing the expanding economy. The world’s most profitable
investment bank lowered its rating on investment-grade corporate
bonds to “neutral,” saying they were likely to return next to
nothing while equities gain 14 percent over 12 months, according
to an Oct. 15 note to clients.  Junk bonds, which Goldman rates “overweight,” will likely
trail stocks, offering returns greater than 10 percent in the
coming year, according to credit strategist  Alberto Gallo .  “It’s going to be harder for high yield to outperform
stocks over the next 12 months,” he said in an interview. “We
already had two years in a row where high yield did better.”  Investors should be buying  stocks  that “look like bonds”
with international sales, below-average debt and growing
dividends, said  Chris Hyzy , New York-based chief investment
officer at U.S. Trust, a Bank of America Corp. unit overseeing
$339.9 billion in client assets.  ‘Sweet Spot’  “That’s the sweet spot for a balanced investor looking to
reallocate from excessive ownership of fixed income,” he said.
“High yield is fairly valued. We expect the gap between the
earnings yield on equities and fixed-income yields to close
considerably in the next 12 to 18 months.”  Shares of retailers and technology companies such as  J.C.
Penney Co.  and  Motorola Inc.  have surged since June 30,
outperforming their bonds in a reversal of the first half, when
equities slumped and junk rallied.  Department-store chain  J.C. Penney  in Plano, Texas, has
returned 47 percent since June 30, compared with a gain of 0.02
percent for its senior unsecured debt,  rated  Ba1 by Moody’s and
BB+ at S&P. That contrasts with the first six months, when
shares fell 19 percent and the debt rose 7 percent.  Motorola , the second-largest U.S. mobile-phone maker, has
surged 23 percent this half, five times the 4.2 percent gain for
its debt. In the first six months, Schaumburg, Illinois-based
Motorola’s bonds returned 16 percent, while its stock lost the
same amount.  Rental Cars  Avis Budget Group Inc.  shares rallied 38 percent since June
30, while the company’s bonds returned 11 percent. Year-to-date,
the bonds of the rental-car company have risen 16 percent,
compared with 3.6 percent for the stock.  “If I had to add money into a portfolio, I’d add it into
equities,” said  James Dunigan , chief investment officer at PNC
Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which oversees $105 billion.
“Stock valuations remain attractive. The earnings prospects
continue to be positive. We’ll likely get back to an economy
which is expanding in the early part of 2011.”  While the S&P 500’s advance has restored  $2.15 trillion  to
market values since July, shares are getting cheaper compared
with profit forecasts. Income growth that analysts predict will
top 13 percent in each of the next two years means the index is
trading at 12.5 times 2011 earnings and 11 times projections for
2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P 500’s average
price-earnings ratio since 1954 is about 16.5, the data show.  Quantitative Easing  At the same time, the Fed’s so-called quantitative easing
policy to buy as much as $600 billion of Treasuries has pushed
down government bond  yields  that are the benchmark for corporate
borrowing and mortgages. Rates on junk fell to a 5 1/2-year low
of 6.97 percent on Nov. 9, from 9.5 percent five months earlier
and a record 23 percent in December 2008, according to the
Barclays Capital index.  “Quantitative easing is extremely supportive of equities
in the short term,” said  Lucette Yvernault , who helps oversee
the equivalent of about 7 billion euros ($9.5 billion) at
Schroders Investment Management Ltd. in London. “The
detrimental impact of the QE is that investors don’t necessarily
reinvest in the U.S. economy, but instead fuel more growth in
emerging markets.”  U.S. earnings may keep rising as more executives than ever
increase forecasts compared with those lowering them.  EBay Inc. ,
 United Parcel Service Inc.  and 196 other companies raised profit
estimates above analysts’ projections last month as 130 firms
cut them, the  biggest gap  since Bloomberg began tracking the
data in 1999.  Greed Kicks In  The S&P 500’s earnings yield averaged 5.6 percent through
the last bull market that ended Oct. 9, 2007, according to data
on reported profit compiled by Bloomberg. Using estimated
income, the index yields 7.1 percent, 0.2 percentage point less
than the average for speculative bonds tracked by Barclays.  “The greed will kick back in, and that’s what will propel
the equity markets,” Huntington Asset’s Sorrentino said.  While stocks have beaten bonds in the past 4 1/2 months,
investors have fared better this year with fixed-income
securities. The Barclays measure of junk bonds has returned 15
percent since Dec. 31, double the advance in the S&P 500.  Investors piled about $190 billion into U.S. bond funds
this year through Oct. 31, a pace that would surpass last year’s
record-setting $214.1 billion, according to Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm  EPFR Global . Clients pulled
about $56 billion out of equity funds and $74.6 billion in 2009.  Flows into junk bonds fell to $1.7 billion in October from
$3.35 billion in September, the most all year, provisional EPFR
data show. That brought the total to about $8.6 billion as of
Oct. 31, compared with $19.9 billion in 2009.  “Ultimately the Fed will succeed,” said  Wayne Lin , a
money manager at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc., which manages
$677 billion. “It’s just a question of how well they will
succeed and how long it’s going to take for them to convince
people to take money out of the mattresses and start putting it
to work.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
