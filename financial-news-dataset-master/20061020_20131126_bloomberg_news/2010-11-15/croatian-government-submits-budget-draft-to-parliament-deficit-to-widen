Croatia’s government , battling a
recession for a second year, submitted its 2011 budget proposal
as part of a plan to more than halve the deficit by 2013.  The shortfall, may grow at 4.2 percent of gross domestic
product this year, will rise to 4.3 percent in 2011 before
reducing it to 2.9 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013,
Finance Minister  Ivan Suker  said in Zagreb today. GDP is seen
growing 1.5 percent next year and 2 percent in 2012, he said.  “It’s an extreme rationalization of costs,” Prime
Minister  Jadranka Kosor  said today at a Cabinet meeting. ‘It’s
also the beginning of a process of cutting costs in the public
sector. The budget will be a social challenge that calls for the
coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.”  Croatia is in the final stretch of negotiations with the
European Union and expects to join the bloc in 2012. Kosor and
her ruling  Croatian Democratic Union  also faces general
elections, which must happen by the end of 2011. The budget
draft includes a fiscal responsibility law aimed at improving
budget management and reducing corruption, as part of the
conditions for EU entry.  The 2011 budget forecasts expenditures of 122.3 billion
kuna and revenue of 107.4 billion kuna and inflation of 2.1
percent in 2011 and 2.5 percent in the two years after that,
Suker said.  The country will need to borrow 23.3 billion kuna to cover
the budget gap next year, including 9.3 billion kuna to service
debt, he said. The government sees the economy contracting as
much as 1.9 percent this year.  The  International Monetary Fund  supports the government’s
efforts to contain the budgetary expenditures in the next two
years, a government statement on Nov. 11 quoted Zuzana
Murgasova, a member of a mission to Zagreb, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
