European discussions on potential
financial support for Ireland may boost the euro and investors
should consider buying the currency against the dollar,
Citigroup Inc. said.  “Markets are likely to view an aid package for Ireland as
euro-positive since it would likely remove the risk of an Irish
default for the time being,” foreign-exchange strategists
 Steven Englander in New York and  Todd Elmer  in Singapore wrote
in an investor note today. “Even if European authorities
provided blanket assistance, the overall fiscal stance would be
better than that of the U.S. Dips approaching recent lows in
euro-dollar may represent buying opportunities.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3682 as of 6:52 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
