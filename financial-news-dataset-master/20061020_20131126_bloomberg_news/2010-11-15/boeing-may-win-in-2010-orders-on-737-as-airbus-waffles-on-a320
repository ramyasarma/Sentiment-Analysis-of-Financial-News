Boeing Co.  may be headed for its
first victory in aircraft orders in three years, buoyed by
demand for the 737 jet as larger rival Airbus SAS defers a
decision on whether to offer a new engine on its A320.  Boeing booked 480 net orders through October, compared with
Airbus’s 369. Chicago-based Boeing’s total includes 432 for the
737, almost twice as many as Airbus’s 217 for the A320, and was
boosted by another three jets in an update last week.  The 787 Dreamliner’s flight-test suspension after a fire
last week spotlighted the importance of the 737, the world’s
most widely flown jetliner. While the 787 has racked up record
advance orders, it has lost four more than it won in 2010, and
Boeing isn’t getting revenue because the first delivery is
almost three years behind schedule.  “The 737 is a high-volume, high-profit machine,” said
 Richard Aboulafia , an analyst at Teal Group, an aerospace
consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia.  Delivery of the 787 has been delayed six times, and Sanford
C. Bernstein’s  Doug Harned  predicted a seventh, which he said
will pressure Boeing’s earnings margins. The New York-based
analyst, who rates the company’s shares “market perform,” told
clients in a note last week he expects Boeing to keep boosting
737 output and post higher profits on the plane.  Airlines are responding positively to Boeing’s firm signal
that it will develop a new plane rather than extend the 737’s
life with a new engine, said Aboulafia. Airbus has said for more
than a year it wants new engines on the A320 as an interim step
until the technology is ready for a replacement, without making
a commitment.  ‘Big Advantage’  Boeing’s stiffer stance “just might win some market share
until all the confusion is cleaned up,” Aboulafia said “It’s
OK to have that uncertainty for a couple of weeks, but do this
all year? That’s what gives the other guy a big advantage.”  Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, has held back on
committing on the A320, saying it’s not sure it has the
resources while engineers work on the super jumbo A380, twin-
aisle A350 and A400M military transport.  Chris Jones, vice president of sales for Airbus in North
America, said the company intends to decide on the A320 by the
end of December. He said that deliberations won’t stretch into
2011, as United Technologies Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  on Nov. 3 said could happen. United Technologies’
Pratt & Whitney unit makes engines for the A320.  Airbus has delivered more jets than Boeing every year since
2003, making it the largest commercial-plane manufacturer.  Boeing’s Preference  While Boeing hasn’t officially decided on the 737 either,
executives have said since at least March that they’d prefer to
focus on developing a new narrow-body aircraft, the backbone of
the air-travel industry, because airlines see a weak business
case for the current jet with a new engine.  Both the 737 and the A320 are twin-engine models that seat
about 125 to 185 people. List prices for each plane range from
about $65 million to $95 million, depending on the version.  Boeing also has stressed this year that the 737 is still
viable as it is. The plane’s  fuel efficiency  is set to improve
by about 2 percent starting in 2011 with a group of tweaks.
Engine maker CFM International, a venture of General Electric
Co. and Safran SA, is smoothing out the 737 power plant’s air
flow, and Boeing is reducing drag by re-engineering parts
including the flashing red light on the jet’s belly.  For its part, Airbus plans to offer so-called sharklets for
an A320 version’s wings in 2012 to boost range and payload.  About half of the airlines with 737s on order are paying to
switch to the new Sky interior, delivered to the first customer
two weeks ago, which draws from a decade of studies by
psychologists and architects for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner.  Pushing Production  With a backlog of more than 2,100 737s, Boeing has pushed
production of the plane to a record 31.5 a month and plans to
boost that in steps to 38 by 2013. Airbus has more than 2,200
unfilled orders for its A320, which it builds at a rate of 36 a
month. Boeing executives are considering another increase, to 40
737s a month.  “I can’t quote delivery positions before 2015, even at
those production rates,” Boeing’s sales chief,  Marlin Dailey ,
said at a briefing last week. “We have a brilliant airplane.”  Boeing also benefits from its wide-body 777, which
Aboulafia said is “low volume but it absolutely dominates the
market, so it has strong profits.”  Airlines don’t seem to be interested in a 737 with new
engines because it would add complexity to their fleets,  Nicole Piasecki , Boeing’s vice president of business development, said
on Nov. 3. Different engines on the same model make maintenance
more complicated.  ‘Bread and Butter’  “There are virtually no customers I can name off the top
of my head, throughout their executive suites, that are pushing
us to re-engine,” Piasecki said. “Right now, there is so much
demand for the 737 and 777 that our primary focus, after
delivering the 787 and 747-8, is getting production up.”  The 737 is Boeing’s “bread and butter,” in Piasecki’s
words. The company needs the jet’s steady revenue stream to fund
other projects, especially amid the 787’s three-year setback.  Boeing will decide “within the next several months” on
what to do with both the 737 and the 777, which will be
threatened by Airbus’s A350,  Jim Albaugh , president of the
company’s commercial-airplanes unit, said at an American Bar
Association conference on Oct. 27.  ‘What’s the Rush?’  “I suspect Boeing will look to a 777 replacement first,
rather than the still strong-selling 737,” said  Doug Runte ,
managing director at Piper Jaffray & Co. in New York.  “If this thing is going gangbusters, and people love the
airplane, and they can pump out 35 a month with their eyes
closed, what’s the rush to re-engine or replace it?” Runte
said. “I don’t see it.”  Airbus parent  European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. 
fell 13 cents to 18.03 euros in Paris trading and has gained
28 percent this year.  Boeing , which dropped 11 percent last
week, rose 52 cents to $63.61 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The U.S. company’s shares have
increased 18 percent this year.  Robert Stallard , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New
York, said in a report today that Boeing shareholders shouldn’t
overreact to the 787 fire and recommended buying the stock.  “The major driver of the Boeing stock price is the
aerospace cycle,” he wrote. “With this end market still
robust, we think the outlook for new orders in encouraging, and
build rates are set to go higher.”  Protecting Slots  Airlines are expanding as the economy recovers and are
placing orders for single-aisle jets now to reserve production
slots, which are sold out for the next two to three years, said
 Howard Rubel , an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York. Some
have contracts to let them switch to a new engine, if one ends
up being offered, he said.  “There are a few airlines holding out to wait and see how
this all plays out,” Rubel said. “The market is still growing
faster than anybody can meet it. The things that work are
selling.”  Airbus’s Jones said the indecision hasn’t hurt A320 sales,
because it’s a matter of resource management, not credibility.
He spoke in an interview Nov. 3, a day before the company
narrowed Boeing’s lead by selling 50 A320s to Chinese airlines.  “We’re not done with the year yet,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
