Peru’s sol fell to its weakest level
in three months as banks and pension funds purchased dollars to
buy Peruvian government debt after last week’s record $2.5
billion, dual-currency bond issue.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.8063 per U.S. dollar at
10:21 a.m. New York time, from 2.8025 on Nov. 12. It earlier
touched 2.8065, the currency’s weakest level since Aug. 13.  Peruvian banks and pension funds purchased about a third of
the $1.5 billion of sol bonds issued by the Andean country last
week. The government sold August 2020 sol bonds redeemable in
dollars in the largest issue of local currency debt in the
international market by a Latin American country. It also sold
$1 billion of 40-year dollar bonds. The sol has declined 0.3
percent since the auction began on Nov. 10.  “It’s the lag following the bond sale,” said  Antonio Diaz , a currency trader at Banco Internacional del Peru. “It
will probably last a few more days,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
