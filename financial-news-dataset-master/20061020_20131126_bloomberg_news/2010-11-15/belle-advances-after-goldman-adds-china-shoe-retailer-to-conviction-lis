Belle International Holdings Ltd. 
rose the most in two weeks in Hong Kong trading after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. added China’s largest retailer of women’s shoes
to its “conviction buy” list.  Belle  climbed 3.5 percent to close at HK$15 as of the 4
p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong. The advance, the biggest
since Nov. 1, made  Belle  the biggest gainer on the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index .  The retailer may be among the companies poised to benefit
from industry consolidation, according to a note Goldman sent to
its clients late on Nov. 12. China’s top 50  retailers  control 5
percent of the market, compared with 41 percent for the biggest
50 in the U.S., the Goldman Sachs analysts said.  The leading U.S. retailers “enjoyed double-digit growth
until their market share reached 7 percent to 8 percent,”
 Joshua Lu ,  Caroline Li , Vivienne Mao and Source Yuan said in the
note. “Their counterparts in China currently have only 1
percent to 2 percent market share” and would benefit from
consolidation that may take place over the next decade, the
analysts said.  China , the world’s most populous nation, has had average
monthly  retail sales growth  of 18.3 percent this year.  Belle , which was included in the Hang Seng Index in
September, has surged 67 percent this year, compared with a 9.9
percent gain for the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
