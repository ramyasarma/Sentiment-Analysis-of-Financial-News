Barclays Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, should make acquisitions to bolster “subscale”
businesses in Spain and Italy, or sell the units, according to
an analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd.  The  bank  needs to double sales outlets in Italy to 600,
while in Spain it’s in seventh or eighth place by market share
rather than the top three or top five, wrote  Arturo De Frias ,
who has a “sell” rating on the stock.  “These are businesses that need to be substantially
upscaled or sold,” wrote De Frias, following a meeting with the
company on Nov. 12. “To get to top three in Spain a very
substantial acquisition would be needed.”  Barclays Finance Director  Chris Lucas  this month said the
bank would consider selling operations that don’t provide
sufficient returns against the capital they require, as the bank
weighs the effect of new rules on capital.  In June,  Antony Jenkins , global retail banking head, said
Barclays would invest as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion)
over four years to expand its operations in the U.K., France,
Italy, Spain and Portugal. Barclays is seeking a top five
position in its markets, he said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
