China supplanted India as the
country with the most international students at U.S. colleges,
with the number of Chinese scholars increasing 30 percent in the
2009-2010 academic year.  A total of 127,628 students from China attended U.S.
institutions of higher learning, making up 19 percent of
international students in the U.S., according to a report
released today by the  Institute of International Education , a
New York-based nonprofit that promotes exchanges between U.S.
and overseas universities.  India, which had been the leading source of international
students since 2001-2002, supplied 104,897 in 2009-2010, second
to China. India’s total rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier.
Chinese students and their parents see a U.S. college education
as a good investment because multinational companies in China
are hiring graduates from U.S. universities, said Peggy
Blumental, executive vice president of the Institute of
International Education.  “China has been sending students to the U.S. for a long
time and returning students have done really well in terms of
jobs,” Blumenthal said. “More and more Chinese parents are
beginning to understand the value of a U.S. education for their
children’s careers.”  One Child  Many Chinese families only have one child because of the
country’s family-planning laws, so the tuition at U.S.
institutions is less burdensome than for families with many
children, Blumenthal said.  China had the biggest increase among the 25 countries
sending the most students, followed by Saudi Arabia, which sent
15,810 students, a gain of 25 percent. The country with the
biggest decline was Japan, which sent 24,842 students, a
decrease of 15 percent.  The total number of international students in the U.S.
climbed 2.9 percent to a record 690,923 in 2009-2010, according
to the report. The total has increased every year since 2005-
2006.  The University of Southern California, in Los Angeles,
hosted 7,987 international students, the most of any U.S.
school, according to the report. USC was followed by the
University of Illinois, in Urbana-Champaign, and New York
University.  The number of U.S. students studying abroad declined less
than 1 percent to 260,327 in 2008-2009, the most recent year for
which data are available, according to the study. The most
popular destination for U.S. students was the U.K., with 31,342,
followed by Italy and Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
