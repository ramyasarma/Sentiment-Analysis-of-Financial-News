The Ecuadorean unit of  Nestle SA ,
the world’s biggest food company, expects sales will rise 39
percent by 2015 as demand for the company’s products grows, the
unit’s Chief Financial Officer Santiago Noboa said today.  Nestle Ecuador SA, the country’s biggest coffee and
chocolate producer, expects “double-digit growth” every year
through 2015, when sales are forecast to rise to $500 million
from the $360 million the company expects this year, Noboa said
in a telephone interview from Quito. The company plans to invest
$415 million in South America’s seventh-biggest economy during
that time period, he said.  Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle is expanding its operations
in Ecuador after emerging-market economies, including Latin
America, “suffered less” during the global economic crisis,
Noboa said. Nestle Ecuador, which began a $74 million bond sale
last week to finance capital spending and improve distribution
chains, will expand its workforce 12 percent this year and may
increase hiring by a similar amount next year, he said.  “Our goal is to grow by at least double digits each year
through 2015,” Noboa, former head of the South American
country’s securities exchange regulator, said in the interview.
“Because of the trust the market has in us, we have had quite
strong growth over the last few years, above all in 2010, and we
expect to have very strong growth through 2015.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
