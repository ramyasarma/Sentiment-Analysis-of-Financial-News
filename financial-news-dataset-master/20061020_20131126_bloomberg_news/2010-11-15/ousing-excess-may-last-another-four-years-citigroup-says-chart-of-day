So many U.S. homes are unoccupied
these days that demand may not catch up with the supply until
2014, according to  Josh Levin , an analyst at Citigroup Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the percentage of housing
units that are vacant, according to quarterly data compiled by
the Commerce Department. The chart also shows housing starts as
a percentage of homes already built, or the housing stock.  Last quarter’s vacancy rate was 10.96 percent, near a peak
of 11.05 percent in the second quarter. These figures are based
on the number of homes for sale and apartments for rent that are
designed for year-round occupancy, and include mobile homes.  About 2.1 million homes now available aren’t needed, Levin
wrote in a report yesterday. The estimate is based on the
overall rate, along with separate figures for  houses  and
 apartments .  “It will take three to four years to work off the excess
supply and reach equilibrium,” he wrote. This means housing
starts are unlikely to follow “a V-shaped recovery pattern”
after plunging in the past few years, the report said.  The number of houses  started  in September, calculated at an
annual rate, was equivalent to 0.5 percent of the housing stock.
That’s down from a high of 1.7 percent, set five years earlier.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
