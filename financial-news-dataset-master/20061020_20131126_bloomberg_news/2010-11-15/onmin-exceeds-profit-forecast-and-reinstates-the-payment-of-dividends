Lonmin Plc , the third-largest
platinum producer, beat fiscal full-year profit estimates and
resumed dividend payments as demand for metals and prices rose.
      Earnings  excluding one-time items were 70 cents a share in
the year through September, after a 59-cent loss the prior year,
the London-based company said in a statement. That exceeded the
62-cent median  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Lonmin declared a  dividend  of 15 cents, the first for two years.  “Market conditions in 2010 were more favorable than 2009
and that shows in our numbers,” Chief Executive Officer  Ian Farmer  said today by phone from London. The company posted sales
of refined platinum of 706,000 ounces, compared with its target
of 700,000 ounces. It forecast 750,000 ounces for this year.  Average prices for platinum, used in jewelry and pollution-
control devices for cars, rose 43 percent to $1,535 an ounce in
the period as economic recovery spurred demand. Anglo Platinum
Ltd., the largest producer of the metal, had a sixfold gain in
first-half profit excluding one-time items and Aquarius Platinum
Ltd. a fourfold increase in fiscal first-quarter net income.  Lonmin climbed as much as 4.6 percent and traded up 4
percent at 1,838 pence by the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading.  The “numbers will be taken well today,”  Charles Kernot  of
Evolution Securities said in a note. “However, 2011 is set to
be a tough year for the company given that its Number One
Furnace will be shut down during quarter one.”  Furnace Leaks  Lonmin, about 25 percent held by  Xstrata Plc , didn’t get
the full benefit of the gain in platinum prices as a leak at its
main furnace cut output and forced the company to employ third
parties to process some of the rock it mines in South Africa.
The delays increased costs and contributed to a more than
threefold jump in debt to $375 million.  The producer is carrying out a third reconstruction in as
many years of its No. 1 furnace, which processes about two-
thirds of Lonmin’s ore, to avoid further leaks. The work began
early November and may be done by mid- to late-December, Farmer
said. Construction may cost about 50 million rand ($7 million),
the company said in a  presentation  today on its website.  Lonmin also plans to build a smaller smelter at a cost of
350 million rand to provide backup and expand capacity by 30
percent by late 2012. The furnace may startup in May that year,
the company said in its earnings presentation.  Farmer Takes Over  Farmer took over in September 2008 as platinum tumbled from
a record at the end of a six-year commodities boom, prompting
him to idle operations and cut jobs by about a fifth.  While it’s “premature” to restart idled operations,
Lonmin expects “growing deficits” in global supplies of the
metal from 2011. The market is “tightly balanced” in 2010, the
company said in its earnings presentation. Platinum has gained
15 percent this year to $1,674.75 an ounce in London. Palladium,
mined together with platinum, gained two-thirds to $678.75.  Lonmin’s labor costs are likely to rise this year as the
company negotiates annual wage increases with South Africa’s
largest union, the National Union of Mineworkers. Smaller rival
 Northam Platinum Ltd.  agreed to pay NUM members increases of 10
percent to 13 percent after 43 days of strike action. South
Africa, with an annual consumer price inflation rate of 3.2
percent in September, is the world’s largest platinum supplier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
