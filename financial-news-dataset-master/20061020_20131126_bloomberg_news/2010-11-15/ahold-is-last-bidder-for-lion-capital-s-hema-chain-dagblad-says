Royal Ahold NV  is now the only
bidder left for Lion Capital LLP’s Hema BV, after private-
equity firms CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and BC Partners Ltd.
pulled out,  Het Financieele Dagblad  said today, citing
unidentified people.  Ahold is in doubt whether to pursue a takeover of Hema,
which may fetch about 1.5 billion euros ($2.05 billion)
according to the newspaper. CVC Capital Partners and BC Partners
found the asking price too high, Het Financieele Dagblad
reported.  Jochem van de Laarschot, spokesman for Amsterdam-based
Ahold, declined to comment when contacted on his cellphone
today.  Ahold, the owner of U.S. Stop & Shop supermarkets, also
controls the biggest Dutch grocery chain. Hema operates 530
variety stores in the Netherlands and has annual sales of 1.1
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
