Ford Motor Co.  will introduce the
battery-powered Focus compact, its first all-electric passenger
car, in 19 U.S. cities in late 2011.  The initial markets to receive the Focus Electric were
selected based on hybrid-buying patterns, utility company
collaboration and local government commitment to battery-powered
vehicles, Ford said in a statement.  “This is the first step in rolling out the Focus
Electric,”  Mark Fields , Ford’s president of the Americas, said
in the statement. “As the country continues to build up its
electric vehicle infrastructure and demand for the Focus
Electric grows, Ford will continue to evaluate additional
markets.”  Ford hasn’t released pricing information on the Focus
Electric. The gasoline-powered Focus, which will make its debut
early next year, will have a starting price of $16,995, Ford
said last month.  The cities are Atlanta, Houston and Austin, Texas; Boston,
Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego,
New York, Orlando, Florida; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona;
Portland, Oregon; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Richmond,
Virginia; Seattle and Washington, D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
