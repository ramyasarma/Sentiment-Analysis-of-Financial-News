South Africa’s National Ports
Authority may increase wood-product export tariffs by as much as
600 percent next year, Business Day reported, citing an
application sent to the National Ports Regulator.  The country’s timber industry, which ships products worth
14.1 billion rand ($2.02 billion) last year, has called the
proposal “outrageous,” the Johannesburg-based newspaper said,
citing Roger Godsmark, chairman of the transport committee of
Forestry SA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
