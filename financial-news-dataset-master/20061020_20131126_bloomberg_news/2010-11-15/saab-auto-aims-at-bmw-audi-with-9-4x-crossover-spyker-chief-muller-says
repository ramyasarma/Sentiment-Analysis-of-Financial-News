Saab Automobile, the Swedish auto
manufacturer that supercar maker  Spyker Cars NV  bought this
year, is challenging  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and Audi AG
with its first crossover being unveiled in two days.  Saab, which will display the 9-4X on Nov. 17 at the Los
Angeles Auto Show, aims for the model to reach annual global
sales of 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles starting in 2012, about half
of which would be in the U.S., Spyker Chief Executive Officer
 Victor Muller  today said in an interview.  “It’s a very important car because this is the extender
of our product portfolio,” Muller said by phone from
Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport as he was about to fly to Los
Angeles. “This means we can capture and keep clients in our
brand much more easily than ever before. That’s very, very
important for us.”  The 9-4X, Saab’s biggest model, will compete with Audi’s
Q5 and Q7 and BMW’s X3 and X5, Muller said. The crossover,
which combines features of a car and a sport-utility vehicle,
expands Trollhaettan-based Saab’s product line beyond the 9-5
sedan that went on sale this year and the eight-year-old 9-3
car. Saab is  planning  to have the 9-4X available in showrooms
by May.  Spyker climbed 3.1 percent to close at 3.196 euros in
Amsterdam trading. The stock has advanced 50 percent this year.  Saab, which  General Motors Co . sold in February, lowered
its full-year sales target last month, saying it aims to build
30,000 to 35,000 cars in 2010 instead of a projected 45,000
vehicles. The company has a target of becoming profitable by
2012, when it plans to sell 120,000 vehicles yearly.  Main Markets  Marketing of the 9-4X will focus on North America and
growth economies including China, Brazil and, “in due course,
India,” Muller said. While the 9-4X will be offered in some
European countries, including the U.K., its sales in the region
will be held back by the vehicle’s size and the lack of a
diesel engine, the 51-year-old Dutchman said.  “It’s too bad there’s no diesel in it for Europe” after
a GM-provided engine didn’t meet its needs for the region,
Muller said. The Swedish carmaker may seek another diesel-
engine supplier for the 9-4X’s future versions, he said.  Saab hasn’t set prices for the crossover yet. The Audi Q5
and Q7 start at $35,200 and $45,700 in the U.S., respectively,
according to the Ingolstadt, Germany-based manufacturer’s
website.  BMW ’s X3 starts at $36,750 and the X5 costs $46,300.  “We have definitely looked very carefully at where Audi
sits with the pricing of the Q5 and Q7,” Muller said. “We’re
a little bit between the Q5 and Q7, and we have to make sure we
are competitive with them.”  BMW will start selling a revamped version of the compact
SUV X3 in the U.S. in January as the Munich-based luxury-car
manufacturer, the world’s biggest, takes on Audi’s better-
selling Q5.  Muller also reiterated that he’s optimistic about finding
a partnership with another carmaker to make a smaller Saab-
brand model inspired by the tear-drop shaped Saab 92 car built
from 1949 to 1956.  “There are so many fruitful discussions ongoing, so I
feel that one of them will bear fruit,” he said, declining to
identify potential partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
