New York’s Eighth Avenue was briefly
closed this afternoon after a report of a suspicious package, a
police spokesman said.  The avenue was shut between 45th and 48th streets because
of police activity, the city said in an earlier e-mail. The
blocks were reopened after the package was determined not to be
suspicious, said a spokesman for the city’s police department
who declined to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
