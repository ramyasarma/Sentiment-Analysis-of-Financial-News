The Bank of England said it will
withdraw its commercial paper facility in 12 months.  The facility “was designed to act as a backstop to help
improve financing conditions for companies,” it said in a
statement today. “The bank’s intention was that the facility
would only remain operational for as long as the highly abnormal
conditions in corporate credit markets that were impairing
finance of real economic activity persisted. The Bank’s
purchases of commercial paper have reduced in recent months and
there is currently no outstanding stock held.”  The central bank also announced the withdrawal of the
Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) Bond Secondary Market Scheme.  “This scheme gave the Bank the option to purchase bonds
issued by banks under the government’s Credit Guarantee
Scheme,” it said. “No purchases have been made under this
facility since inception.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
