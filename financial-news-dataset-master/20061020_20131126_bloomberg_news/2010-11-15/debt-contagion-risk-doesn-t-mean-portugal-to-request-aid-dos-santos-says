Portuguese Finance Minister  Fernando Teixeira  dos Santos said his country is being buffeted by the
latest stage of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, though that
doesn’t necessarily mean the country will ask for a bailout.  “There is a risk of contagion,” he said in an interview
when asked whether  Portugal  will turn to the European Union for
aid. “But there’s a big difference between saying there is a
risk of contagion and saying help is imminent or that we are
going to ask for help.”  Dos Santos’s comments come as EU officials pressure Ireland
to accept a bailout as concerns about its fiscal health threaten
to spread across the euro region. Earlier today, the Financial
Times cited Dos Santos as saying “the risk is high” that
Portugal will have to ask for an international rescue.  “Portugal has been able to guarantee financing in the
market,” Dos Santos said in the interview. “There has been
demand for Portuguese debt. We are in a situation where we have
mechanisms to continue to finance ourselves in the markets and
face this situation.”  The extra yield that investors demand to hold 10-year
Portugal bonds over German bunds slipped 8 basis points to 415
points today. It touched a record 484 basis points on Nov. 11.  “Portugal’s situation is much different from Ireland’s,”
he said. “Ireland is facing problems with its financial system
that Portugal doesn’t have.”  Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Negocios reported today that
Dos Santos says the country has made no aid request to the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
