The euro may weaken as the risk of
contagion from Ireland’s debt woes increases amid concern that
the nation may need a bailout from the European Union, according
to Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  “The austerity measures and the problems in the banking
system make people feel that the likelihood that Ireland will
ultimately be able to go it alone is very low indeed,”  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at the bank in London, said
in a telephone interview today. “The European Union and the
European Central Bank are clearly mindful of the risk of
contagion. If there’s disagreement over Ireland, at what point
do you find Portugal coming under pressure? Until we get a clear
decision on Ireland, the downward pressure on the euro and the
upward pressure on the dollar will continue.”  The euro weakened 0.4 percent to $1.3634 as of 10:10 a.m.
in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
