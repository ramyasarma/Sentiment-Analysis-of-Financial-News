OAO Gazprom Neft  has signed an
agreement with Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd., known as
Petronas, to buy a 30 percent stake in a project to develop four
blocks off Cuba, as the Russian oil producer expands abroad.  The agreement requires approval by Cuban authorities to
become effective, Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russia’s natural-
gas export monopoly, said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Gazprom Neft’s partnership with Petronas will enable the
company to further extend its geographic reach and strengthen
its position in the global market,” Gazprom Neft Chief
Executive Officer  Alexander Dyukov  said in the statement.  Gazprom Neft is seeking to expand abroad in Venezuela,
Equatorial Guinea and Iraq as it aims to almost double output to
2 million barrels a day in 2020.  Petronas and the Cuban government signed a production
sharing agreement for Blocks 44, 45, 50 and 51 in the Gulf of
Mexico in 2007, according to Gazprom Neft. The first exploration
drilling is scheduled for 2011, Gazprom Neft said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
