Walter Netschi, one of two men
charged with running an $80 million Ponzi scheme involving phony
investments in automatic teller machines, was convicted of all
10 criminal counts against him.  A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Netschi on Nov. 12 of
one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of
wire fraud after deliberating for 1 1/2 days at the end of a
three-week trial.  Netschi’s co-defendant, Vance Moore II, pleaded guilty to
all 10 counts on Oct. 18. The two men were charged with stealing
money from investors from 2005 to January 2008, falsely telling
them their money was being used to purchase ATMs throughout the
U.S. Instead, they used money from new investors to pay off
earlier investors in the scheme, prosecutors said.  U.S. District Judge  Thomas Griesa  set a sentencing hearing
for Netschi on March 2. Moore is scheduled to be sentenced Jan.
20. They face a maximum 20 years in prison on each of the
counts.  “We are disappointed with the verdict,” Netschi’s
attorney, Beth Farber, said in a telephone interview today.
Netschi plans to appeal, she said.  The case is U.S. v. Netschi, 09-CR-881, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
