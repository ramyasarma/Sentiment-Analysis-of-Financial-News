Copper declined for a second day
from London to Shanghai amid growing concerns that China, the
largest user, may take more measures to cool its economy,
dimming the demand prospects for commodities. Zinc, lead and tin
also tumbled.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange dropped as much as 1.6 percent to $8,474 a metric ton
at 2:39 p.m. Singapore time after climbing as much as 0.9
percent to $8,691.75 a ton earlier. It declined as much as 3.2
percent on Nov. 12, the biggest intraday drop since June 29, on
speculation that China may further tighten monetary policy.  “The prospects of China tightening have been going on for
many months and while the market gets spooked every time the
government announces some measure to cool inflation or the
property sector, excess liquidity still remains an issue and
coupled with good fundamentals, prices are just going to go
higher,” Huang Yong, an analyst at Mailyard Futures Co., said
today from Hubei.  March-delivery copper on the Comex in New York fell as much
as 1.1 percent to $3.8535 a pound, after rising as much as 1.5
percent earlier. Futures in Shanghai lost as much as 3 percent
to 63,650 yuan ($9,575) a ton, after earlier gaining as much as
1.5 percent, and settled at 64,930 yuan. Shanghai zinc slumped
by its daily limit for a second day.  China’s four biggest banks will not issue any new loans to
property developers for the rest of the year, the state-run
China Real Estate Business reported, citing unidentified
executives at the banks.  ‘Bullish’ Outlook  The People’s Bank of China may raise interest rates twice
late this year and early next year, the Economic Daily reported
on its website today, citing Chen Xikang, a researcher with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Consumer prices rose to the fastest
pace in two years in October, building the case for the central
bank to add to last month’s interest-rate increase.  “The fundamental outlook for copper in 2011 is bullish and
it is hard to see copper in anything other than sizable deficit
-- we continue to forecast a 420,000-ton deficit in 2011,”
Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts led by  Jim Lennon  wrote in a note
today. “At present, China is de-stocking concentrate, scrap and
refined copper. Our view is that China will de-stock the
available scrap and concentrate by early next year and will need
to return to the market around that time.”  Codelco, the world’s biggest copper producer, will increase
the surcharge on cathode sales to Japan by 31 percent, to South
Korea by 32 percent and to Europe by 23 percent. Buyers from all
three regions will pay $98 a ton next year in addition to the
price of copper for immediate delivery on the LME to cover costs
such as shipping and insurance.  Collahuasi Output  In Chile,  Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc  continued to
produce copper at a normal rate at the Collahuasi mine, the
fourth largest, as a worker’s strike entered a 10th day. Copper
in London rose to a record $8,966 a ton last week partly on
concern shipments at the mine, which accounts for more than 3
percent of the world’s production of the metal, may be
disrupted.  “While we recognize copper is a well-broked bull story and
there is the potential for a pullback, we continue to believe
that copper prices will rise further in 2011, with any pullbacks
in the short term potentially presenting good buying
opportunities,” Lennon wrote.  Zinc in London dropped 3.9 percent to $2,300 a ton, lead
declined 3.4 percent to $2,433.75 a ton and tin shed 2.1 percent
to $25,600 a ton. Nickel decreased 0.7 percent to $22,515 a ton,
and aluminum lost 0.9 percent to $2,383.50 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
