Oil declined for a third day after
manufacturing in the New York region unexpectedly contracted in
November, signaling the pace of fuel demand recovery in the
world’s biggest crude-consuming nation may falter.  Futures dropped after the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic index fell to minus 11.1 from 15.7 in
October. Economists forecast the measure would fall to 14 this
month, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News
survey. Prices had initially advanced yesterday after U.S.
retail sales rose the most in seven months.  “There’s still a sense of pessimism out there,”  David Taylor , a market analyst at CMC Markets Ltd. in Sydney, said in
a note today. “Last night continued a broad theme that has been
developing since a number of worries came to the surface last
week. They include concerns over Ireland’s sovereign debt,
worries over future rate rises in China and the health of the
U.S. economy.”  The December contract slid as much as 60 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $84.26 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $84.30 at 1:12 p.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday, it lost 2 cents to $84.86 after rising as much
as 89 cents. Prices are up 6.3 percent this year.  Futures slipped 3.3 percent on Nov. 12 as Chinese equities
tumbled after a report that showed consumer prices climbed 4.4
percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2008.
China’s central bank may increase rates within weeks, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Refinery Restart  Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen put possible aid for banks
on the agenda of today’s meeting of euro finance ministers as
European Central Bank officials urged the nation to tap a 750
billion-euro ($1 trillion) fund created in May.  U.S. gasoline prices slipped yesterday amid speculation
that ConocoPhillips is nearing the restart of its Bayway
refinery in New Jersey after maintenance that began in September.  Futures for December delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$2.1905 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Yesterday,
it declined 1.49 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.195.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show crude
stockpiles  fell  700,000 barrels last week from 364.9 million
barrels, according to the median of nine analyst estimates
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Fuel supplies also decreased, the
analysts said in the survey.  The dollar traded at $1.3606 per euro after gaining 0.8
percent yesterday. A stronger U.S. currency curbs investor
demand for raw materials.  Brent crude for January settlement lost as much as 32 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $86.38 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
