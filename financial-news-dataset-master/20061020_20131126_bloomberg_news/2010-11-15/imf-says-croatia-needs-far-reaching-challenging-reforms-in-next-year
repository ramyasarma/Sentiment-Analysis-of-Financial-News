Croatia, which is seeking to become
the next country to join the European Union, needs “far-
reaching” and “challenging reforms,” the International
Monetary Fund said.  The Adriatic Sea nation needs to “streamline its public
sector” and improve its fiscal policy framework, the Washington
D.C.-based lender said.  The economy will probably contract “almost” 2 percent
this year before displaying “positive but subdued,” gross
domestic product growth in 2011, the IMF said today in an
Article IV statement released following its annual country
review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
