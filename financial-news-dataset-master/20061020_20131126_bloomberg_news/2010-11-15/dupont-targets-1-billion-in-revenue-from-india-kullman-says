DuPont Co. , the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, said it expects annual revenue from India to
increase more than 40 percent to about $1 billion by 2012, aided
by agriculture, infrastructure and automotive products.  Sales in the nation this year may climb to about $700
million from $500 million in 2009, Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman  said today in an interview in New Delhi, while attending
the World Economic Forum summit. Spending on a local research
laboratory will be boosted by 500 million rupees and the
expansion will be completed by the middle of next year, she said
yesterday.  Global crop production must rise 86 percent to meet world
food needs by 2050, according to a March study sponsored by
 DuPont ,  Monsanto Co . and their rivals. Wilmington, Delaware-
based DuPont is working with farmers in India on agronomy and
soil-testing to increase yield and expects the country to become
its fifth-biggest revenue contributor “in a few short years”
from 10th at present, Kullman said.  “Productivity is really the key to the future of
agriculture in India,” Kullman said. “We are working to
produce new varieties of hybrids in things like rice and corn to
increase productivity.”  Farmers in India, the world’s second-biggest grower of rice,
produced an average 3.3 metric tons of paddy per hectare (2.5
acres) in 2007, compared with 6.4 tons in China, 10.3 tons in
Egypt and 8.1 tons in the U.S., according to the latest Indian
government data.  Kullman presented a plan in November last year to increase
the company’s earnings 20 percent a year and sales at least 10
percent. Third-quarter net income dropped 10 percent, less than
analysts estimated, to $367 million, DuPont reported Oct. 26.
Sales rose 17 percent to $7 billion.  DuPont  fell 48 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $46.52 at the
close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
