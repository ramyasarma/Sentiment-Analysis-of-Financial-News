             LS Power Group, the electricity-
plant developer with stakes in generators  Dynegy Inc. (DYN)  and
 Calpine Corp., (CPN)  won approval to build a coal-burning plant on
U.S. government land in Nevada.  
 The Bureau of Land Management announced the  decision 
yesterday in the Federal Register. Final construction may be
delayed until 2012 by environmental challenges to that and other
key permits, Mark Milburn, a spokesman in St. Louis for New
York-based LS Power, said today in an interview.  
 LS Power may spend $1 billion or more on the White Pine
Energy project, depending on demand for its output once the
legal hurdles are cleared, Milburn said. The BLM permit allows
construction of up to three 530-megawatt units, he said.  
 “It’s a major step,” Milburn said. The project also needs
an air-pollution permit from  Nevada  and certification by the
Nevada Public Utilities Commission that it has all necessary
environmental permits. Those decisions could come as early as
next year’s first quarter, he said.  
 Planning for permit appeals “is a general realistic
expectation” for coal-plant developers, Milburn said.  
 Coal accounts for about half of the U.S. power supply,
according to the Energy Department in  Washington . As many as 110
new coal plants are planned, the department reported in June.
About 12 percent of coal-burning power capacity proposed since
2002 has been built, the department said.  
 A megawatt can power 800 average U.S. homes, according to
the Energy Department in Washington.
