China stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index erasing an earlier loss of 2 percent, as concern
faded that policy makers will raise interest rates as soon as
this weekend and investors speculated losses were overdone.  Kweichow Moutai Co.  and Wuliangye Yibin Co., China’s two
largest spirits producers, climbed more than 2 percent after
Nomura Holdings Inc. said it’s “bullish” on the nation’s food
and beverage stocks.  SAIC Motor Corp. , the country’s biggest
automaker, rose 1.7 percent after buying a stake in General
Motors Co.  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 23.11, or 0.8 percent, to
2,888.57 at the close after swinging between gains and losses at
least 10 times. The measure lost 3.2 percent this week,
extending last week’s 4.6 percent decline. The CSI 300 Index
climbed 1 percent to 3,178.85 yuan.  “There is much uncertainty regarding further monetary
policies,” said  Zack Liu , head of quantitative investment at
China Southern Fund Management Co. in Shenzhen. “That will
influence the market sentiment and lead to volatility.”  -- Chua Kong Ho ,  Irene Shen  in Shanghai. Editors:  Richard Frost ,
