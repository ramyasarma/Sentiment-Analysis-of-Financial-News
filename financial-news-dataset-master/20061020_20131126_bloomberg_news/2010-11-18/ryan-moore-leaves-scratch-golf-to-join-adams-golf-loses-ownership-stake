Ryan Moore  signed an endorsement
contract with  Adams Golf Inc. , leaving  Scratch Golf  one year
after becoming a part-owner and endorser of the 7-year-old
company.  Moore, who won a career-high $2.4 million  this past season 
on the U.S. PGA Tour, will forfeit all ownership in Scratch, the
Chattanooga, Tennessee-based company said  in a press release .  Neither Scratch President Ari Techner nor Moore, the No. 42
player in the Official World Golf Ranking, gave a reason for the
split.  “I’m excited about joining a company that is committed to
developing world-class golf clubs and where I can make an
impact,” Moore, 27, said in a  statement  released by Adams.
Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  The former U.S. Amateur champion has used a driver and
hybrid club made by Plano, Texas-based Adams for several years.
He switched to Scratch irons and wedges before 2010 after
playing most of the 2009 season without an equipment sponsor.  Two months after reaching an agreement with Moore last
November, closely held Scratch hired Don White,  Jack Nicklaus ’s former clubmaker, to build its custom clubs.
White will continue to work for Scratch, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
