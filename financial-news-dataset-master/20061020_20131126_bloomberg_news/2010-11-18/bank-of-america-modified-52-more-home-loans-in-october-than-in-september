Bank of America Corp.  said it
modified about 25,000 home loans in October, a 52 percent
increase from the previous month amid the lender’s freeze on
foreclosure sales in 27 states.  About 90 percent of the modifications were approved through
the bank’s own programs, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender said in a statement. The rest of the revisions were
approved through the U.S. government’s Home Affordable
Modification Program, or HAMP. Modifications typically involve
reduced interest rates or extending the time in which loans must
be repaid.  Congressional leaders and housing industry activists have
criticized HAMP for failing to stem the growth of home
foreclosures, and banks for making the process too slow and
complex. About 2.1 million U.S. households are in foreclosure
proceedings, with 5 million more loans at least 30 days
delinquent, data provider Lender Processing Services Inc. said
in a Nov. 16 report.  At the end of October, about 50,000 Bank of America
customers were in active trial modifications through HAMP, down
from 62,000 in September and more than 250,000 in March, the
lender said. Bank of America has resumed foreclosure sales in 23
states, while freezing seizures in 27 others as it studies its
processes. The bank is the largest in the U.S. by assets and the
second-largest home lender after San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
& Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
