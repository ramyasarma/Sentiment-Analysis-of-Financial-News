Bonds issued by  General Motors Co. ’s
bankrupt predecessor declined for a third consecutive day after
the largest U.S. automaker raised more than $20 billion in an
initial public offering.  The 8.375 percent bonds due in July 2033, which were issued
by the old General Motors Corp. and will eventually convert to
shares in the new GM, fell 2.063 cents to 33 cents on the dollar
at 1:14 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-pricing
service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The securities are the second-most actively traded U.S.
corporate bonds today after First Data Corp.’s, with 195 trades
of $1 million or more as of 1:26 p.m. in New York, according to
Trace. They touched $37 Nov. 1, the highest in about six weeks.  GM may conduct a “small” debt offering to establish a
“credit benchmark,” Chief Financial Officer  Chris Liddell  said
today on a conference call with reporters.  “That will be modest and in the context of providing some
more liquidity and moving towards the concept of repaying all of
our debt,” Liddell said. “We may take some actions over the
next year, but there’s nothing of any significance from a debt
point of view that you’re going to see.”  GM ’s owners, including the U.S. Treasury, sold $15.8
billion of common shares at $33 each yesterday in the second-
largest U.S. IPO on record. The company’s offering of $4.35
billion of preferred shares and an overallotment option may
boost the total to $23.1 billion. That would top the $22.1
billion raised by Beijing-based Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.
in the biggest IPO of common stock in history.  The automaker had outstanding debt of $8.6 billion as of
Sept. 30, according to GM’s IPO prospectus filed with
regulators.  GM repaid $2.8 billion of outstanding debt on Oct. 26 and
entered into a new five-year, $5 billion secured revolving
credit facility, according to the filing. GM has no
“significant contractual debt maturities” until 2015, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
