Angola , Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer, is expected to achieve an economic-growth rate of 7.6
percent next year, boosted by an expanding non-oil industry,
Finance Minister Carlos Alberto Lopes said.  Oil production, which ranks second on the continent to
output in  Nigeria , is forecast at 1.9 million barrels per day,
Lopes told lawmakers in his annual budget presentation today in
Luanda, the capital. The budget is based on a “conservative”
estimate that oil will trade at $68 per barrel, he said.  “This budget was set in an environment of recovery from the
effects of the global financial crisis,” he said.  Spending in the year ahead will total 3.39 trillion kwanza
($36.8 billion) and revenue is forecast at 3.23 trillion kwanza,
leaving a budget surplus of 164 billion kwanza, or 1.9 percent
of gross domestic product, Lopes said.  Angola is rebuilding after a 27-year civil war that ended
in 2002. The  International Monetary Fund  said last month that
economic growth is expected to accelerate in 2011 from 2.5
percent this year as the effects of production problems in the
oil industry and “fiscal retrenchment” unwind.  On Oct. 15, President  Jose Eduardo dos Santos  forecast
economic growth at 4.5 percent this year and 8 percent in 2011.
Angola’s oil industry is expected to expand 2.3 percent next
year, with non-oil growth forecast at 11 percent, Lopes said
today.  Inflation  Inflation in the year ahead is expected to be 12 percent,
Lopes said. The forecast compares with an estimate of less than
10 percent predicted in the government’s 10 budget. The annual
inflation rate climbed to 16 percent in October from 15.7
percent a month earlier, driven by higher public-transport
costs.  Angola will spend $989 million settling foreign debt and
904 billion kwanza repaying domestic debt, Lopes said.  The government has paid $2.7 billion of $6.8 billion in
debt owed to Portuguese and Brazilian construction companies,
Dos Santos said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
