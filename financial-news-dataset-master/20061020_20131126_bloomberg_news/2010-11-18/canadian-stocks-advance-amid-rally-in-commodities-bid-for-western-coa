     Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks gained the most
since August as oil and metals prices rallied on the prospect of
a bailout for Ireland and Walter Energy Inc. offered to buy
Vancouver-based  Western Coal Corp .    Suncor Energy Inc ., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer,
jumped 3.9 percent as oil rose the most in two weeks. Western
Coal, which mines in Canada and the U.S., surged 47 percent
after Tampa, Florida-based Walter Energy offered a bid it valued
at C$3.3 billion ($3.24 billion).  Royal Bank of Canada , the
country’s largest lender by assets, rose 2.2 percent as the
S&P/TSX Banks Index climbed the most in almost 12 weeks.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 212.18
points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,870.01 at 4 p.m. in Toronto.  “When Europe gets in trouble, anybody selling into Europe,
whether Canadians selling oil or Americans selling software,
will all be in trouble,” said Paul Ma, who manages C$500
million as a money manager at McLean & Partners in Calgary.
“When we hear of a bailout, everything sort of gets calmed
down, and hopefully there is enough economic progress in all the
European countries to generate enough  tax revenue  to get
themselves out of trouble.”  The index has advanced for two straight days, after
declining 3.5 percent since Nov. 8 on concerns over European
budget deficits and the possibility of further tightening of
credit by China’s central bank.  Ireland Ready  The euro increased as much as 1 percent against the U.S.
dollar today, the most since Nov. 3, after Irish Finance
Minister Brian Lenihan said his government is prepared to accept
an aid package for the nation’s banks after talks with the
European Union and International Monetary Fund conclude.  Oil and raw materials climbed as the U.S. dollar decreased.  Crude futures rose for the first day since Nov. 10. Suncor
gained 3.9 percent to C$34.90, ending a five-day streak of
losses.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd ., the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, advanced 3.1 percent to
C$39.99.  Celtic Exploration Ltd., which produces oil and gas in
Alberta, increased 4.2 percent to C$16.20 after Brian Kristjansen, an analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc., raised his
rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold.” Yesterday, Celtic
soared 19 percent after announcing drilling results.    Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp ., which produces oil and gas
in Colombia, gained 5.1 percent to C$31.09 after announcing that
two processing facilities of a joint venture have begun
operations. The start-ups “will mitigate some of the risk of
not reaching year-end production targets,” David Ricciardi, an
analyst at Jennings Capital Inc., said in a note to clients.  Buyout Offer  Western Coal rallied 47 percent to C$10.86 after Walter
Energy offered C$11.50 in cash and stock for the company.
Western Coal said it began exclusive negotiations with the U.S.
coal producer. Western Coal jumped as much as 51 percent, the
most in 10 years, to an intraday record of C$11.15.    Cline Mining Corp ., which produces coal in British
Columbia, climbed 12 percent to C$2.62 after earlier touching a
21-year high of C$2.89.  Grande Cache Coal Corp ., which mines in
Alberta, surged 12 percent to C$8.60.  Base-metals producers rose as all of the major industrial
raw materials traded on the London Metal Exchange gained.    Teck Resources Ltd ., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, gained 3.3 percent to C$50.29.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd ., the country’s second-biggest publicly traded copper
producer, advanced 4.9 percent to C$91.15 after UBS AG added the
stock to its “key call” list. Equinox Minerals Ltd., which
mines copper in Africa, increased 5.7 percent to C$5.79.  Banks Rise  All eight S&P/TSX banks climbed. Royal Bank rose 2.2
percent to C$54.28.  Toronto-Dominion Bank , its largest domestic
rival, gained 1.7 percent to C$74.24.  Manulife Financial Corp .,
North America’s fourth-biggest insurer, advanced for a fourth
day, climbing 2.4 percent to C$15.69.    Linamar Corp ., Canada’s second-largest auto-parts maker,
increased 4.5 percent to C$20.29 after customer General Motors
Corp. rallied as much as 9.1 percent following a $20 billion
initial public offering.    Uranium One Inc ., the uranium producer in which Russia’s
ARMZ is buying a controlling stake, climbed 5.2 percent to
C$4.89. Yesterday, David A. Talbot, an analyst at DundeeWealth
Inc., and Stanislav Chuyev, an analyst at Kazakhstan’s Visor
Capital Joint Stock Co., boosted their 12-month share-price
estimates on the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
