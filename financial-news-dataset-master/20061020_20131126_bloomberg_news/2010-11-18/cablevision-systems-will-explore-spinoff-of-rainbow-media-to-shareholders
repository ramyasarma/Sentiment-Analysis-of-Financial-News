Cablevision Systems Corp. said its
board of directors has authorized the company’s management to
explore a potential leveraged spinoff of its Rainbow Media
Holdings LLC business to Cablevision’s stockholders, which would
be structured as a tax-free pro rata distribution to
stockholders.  Businesses that are expected to remain a part of
Cablevision, should the Rainbow spinoff occur, include the
cable and telecommunications business, Newsday, News 12
Networks, MSG Varsity and Clearview Cinemas.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
