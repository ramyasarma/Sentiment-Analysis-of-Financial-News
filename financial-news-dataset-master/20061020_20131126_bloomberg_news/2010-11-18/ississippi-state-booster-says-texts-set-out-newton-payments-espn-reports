A Mississippi State University
booster said a representative of  Cameron Newton ’s father wanted
payments of $180,000 over 60 days for the quarterback to join
the Bulldogs, ESPN reported.  Bill Bell told the broadcaster he received a text from his
former Mississippi State teammate Kenny Rogers demanding
payments on behalf of Newton’s father, Cecil. Newton is the
quarterback for Auburn University.  Rogers “told me this kid’s dad is going to want money and
the next day he sent me a text message,” Bell said, according
to ESPN. “He didn’t say anything other than ‘This is what I
want and I want it in three installments.’”  Bell shared the information and a series of voice mails
from Rogers with the National Collegiate Athletic Association to
clear Mississippi State of any wrongdoing, ESPN said.  Cecil Newton said Mississippi State coach  Dan Mullen  would
have “to put a smile on my face if he thinks he’s going to get
my son,” Bell recounted, according to ESPN.  Rogers’s attorney Douglas Zeit told ESPN that the $180,000
payment plan that his client discussed was the one Cecil Newton
wanted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
