New Zealand rugby captain  Richie McCaw  and full-back  Mils Muliaina  were selected to play their
record 93rd Test match against Ireland on Nov. 20.  The pair had tied the mark of 92 Tests set by former All
Blacks captain  Sean Fitzpatrick  in the 49-3 win over Scotland
five days ago.  The starting lineup to face Ireland in Dublin features five
changes from that team with lock Tom Donnelly, flanker Jerome
Kaino, scrum-half Andy Ellis, inside center  Ma’a Nonu  and winger
Cory Jane coming in.  Top-ranked New Zealand has played Ireland 23 times since
1905 with the Irish yet to win a Test.  New Zealand:  1.  Tony Woodcock  2.  Hikawera Elliot  3.  Owen Franks   4.  Brad Thorn   5.  Tom Donnelly   6.  Jerome Kaino   7.  Richie McCaw (captain)   8.
