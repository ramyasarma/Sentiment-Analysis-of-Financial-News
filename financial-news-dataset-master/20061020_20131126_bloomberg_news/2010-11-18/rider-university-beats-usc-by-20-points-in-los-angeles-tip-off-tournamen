Rider University’s basketball team
beat the University of Southern California 77-57 last night in
the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament, the second year in a row
the New Jersey school has had an early season win against an
opponent from a major conference.  Justin Robinson, a senior guard from London, scored a
career-high 28 points to lead the Broncs, who entered the game
in Los Angeles as 11-point underdogs, according to oddsmakers.  Robinson hit nine of 10 shots, including all five of his 3-
point attempts, as  Rider  improved to 2-1. The Lawrenceville, New
Jersey, school started last season with a 14-point win at then-
No. 18 ranked Mississippi State.  Rider coach  Tommy Dempsey  said his senior class now has
wins over schools from the Big East, Southeastern, Big Ten and
Pacific 10 conferences.  “I think it was about 26 years between those four and the
last big Rider win in the early 1980s,” Dempsey said in
comments on the school’s website. “It’s a tough group of kids
who have won a lot of big games, and when they come into these
environments they expect to win.”  USC trailed throughout the game, including 67-42 at one
point, and fell to 2-1 on the season.  The Trojans are eligible for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament this season after being banned
from the postseason last year for rules violations involving
former player O.J. Mayo. The program lost one scholarship each
of the past two seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
