China Telecom Corp. , the nation’s
biggest fixed-line phone carrier, denied it hijacked Internet
traffic, after a U.S. government report said the company wrongly
diverted international Web data.  “The spokesman of China Telecom Corporation Ltd. denied
any hijack of Internet traffic,” the state-owned company said
in an e-mailed statement today. The Beijing-based carrier didn’t
elaborate.  China Telecom sent erroneous Internet-traffic instructions
that briefly diverted about 15 percent of global Web traffic
through servers in China, the  U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission  said in a report yesterday. The incident,
which lasted about 18 minutes on April 8, affected U.S. military
and government sites, as well as sites run by companies
including  Yahoo! Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp. , the report said.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  Hong Lei  declined to
comment at a regular briefing in Beijing today beyond saying the
“relevant company has already made a response on that matter.”  The commission, created in 2000 to advise Congress about
national security implications of U.S. relations with China,
said that “perhaps most disconcertingly” the diverted data
might “possibly allow a telecommunications firm to compromise
the integrity of supposedly secure encrypted sessions.”  China Telecom had 178.3 million fixed-line subscribers at
the end of September, almost 80 percent more than closest rival
 China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
