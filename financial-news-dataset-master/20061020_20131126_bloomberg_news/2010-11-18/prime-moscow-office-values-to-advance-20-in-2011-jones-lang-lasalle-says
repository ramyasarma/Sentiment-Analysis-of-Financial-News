Prices for top-tier offices will
rise more in Moscow than anywhere else in the world next year as
investors compete for prime assets, according to  Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. , the world’s second-largest commercial property
broker.  Office values in Moscow will surge more than 20 percent in
2011, the Chicago-based company said today in its Global Market
Perspective report. In 11 other markets, including New York and
London, values of the best offices will gain at least 10
percent, the company forecast.  “The two-tier real estate market will persist in 2011 and
movements in asset prices will be strongly differentiated
according to product type, quality and location,” Jones Lang
said. “For a large spectrum of the secondary market, values are
likely to continue to flounder near the cyclical bottom.”  Prime office values are recovering, following the global
financial crisis, in countries where developers halted
construction projects in 2008. In Dubai, where the equivalent of
70 percent of the existing office space will be added between
now and the end of 2012, prices are still falling.  Hong Kong office rents are expected to gain more than 20
percent in 2011, with increases of at least 10 percent expected
in cities including Moscow, London, New York and Tokyo, the
broker said.  Dubai will perform worst in terms of both property values
and rental values in 2011, with both dropping between 10 percent
and 20 percent,  Jones Lang  said. Madrid will be the second-worst
performer.  Jones Lang estimates investors will spend more than $350
billion buying all types of commercial property in 2011, an
increase of at least 25 percent over the expected result for
2010 of almost $300 billion.  Investment will increase fastest in the Americas, and
slowest in Asia, where the downturn was less severe. The value
of acquisitions in Europe, the world’s biggest market, is likely
to increase by at least 30 percent, Jones Lang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
