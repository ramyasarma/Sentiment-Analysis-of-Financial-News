Gap Inc.  posted a 1.3 percent drop
in third-quarter profit, meeting analysts’ estimates, as sales
at its namesake clothing stores in North America rebounded.  Net income fell to $303 million, or 48 cents a share, in
the three months ended Oct. 30, from $307 million, or 44 cents,
a year earlier, the San Francisco-based retailer said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted 48 cents, the average of  estimates 
tracked by Bloomberg.  The Gap brand had trailed the growth at the Old Navy and
Banana Republic brands this year and its turnaround has been a
focus of Chief Executive Officer Glenn Murphy, who in March
described it as being on a “slippery slope.” Gap locations
account for more than a third of all stores.  The retailer expects revenue growth to come from outside
the U.S. and has expanded online sales to more than 80 countries
from 25 last year. International same-store sales gained 3
percent in the third quarter after a 6 percent drop a year ago.  Gap rose 19 cents, or 1 percent, to $20.88 today at 3:46
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange  composite trading . The shares
had lost 1.2 percent this year before today.  The company previously reported third-quarter revenue
increased 1.7 percent to $3.65 billion from a year ago. Revenue
at stores open at least a year, so-called same-store sales, was
little changed. The Gap brand rose 1 percent compared with a 7
percent decline in the same period last year.  The company reiterated that full-year net income would be
$1.77 to $1.82 a share. Analysts on average projected $1.83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
