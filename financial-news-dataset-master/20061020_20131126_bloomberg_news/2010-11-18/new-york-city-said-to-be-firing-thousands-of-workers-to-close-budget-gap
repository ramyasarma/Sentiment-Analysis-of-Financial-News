New York City will fire thousands of
workers to save $1.5 billion while facing a projected $3.3
billion budget deficit in the next fiscal year, said a city
official familiar with the plan who requested anonymity because
it hasn’t been made public.  Stephen Goldsmith , Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ’s deputy for
operations, has scheduled a briefing today to disclose how many
workers will be fired in each city agency, the official said.
The city, which has projected a $65 billion budget next year,
employs more than 300,000 workers.  Bloomberg ordered a hiring freeze in September, directing
most agency heads to reduce spending by 5.4 percent this fiscal
year, which ends June 30, and 8 percent next year. Departments
of public safety, sanitation and education must trim current
budgets by 2.7 percent, and 4 percent next year.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
