Air Berlin Plc , Germany’s second-
biggest airline, said it will reverse expansion in the country
as a new tax on air travel makes some routes unviable, the
second carrier to specify cutbacks because of the fee.  Seven of Air Berlin’s 167 planes will be removed from
service as the airline reduces capacity by 5 percent, the
Berlin-based company said today in a statement. The tax, which
takes effect on Jan. 1, will probably lead to costs of
160 million euros ($218 million) to 170 million euros, it said.  The move follows  Ryanair Holdings Plc ’s decision in October
to  cut flights  by 30 percent at its Frankfurt-Hahn airport base
in the summer 2011 schedule because of the tax on flights
leaving the country. The levy will add 8 euros to tickets to 52
European destinations, 25 euros to 50 airports in Asia and
Africa and 45 euros to all other destinations. The tax is part
of 80 billion euros in budget cuts and revenue-raising measures.  “Fierce competition on some flight routes will make it
impossible to pass on the air-travel tax to the passengers in
its entirety,” Air Berlin Chief Executive Officer  Joachim Hunold  said in the statement, adding that the company had
originally planned to add capacity next year.  Air Berlin  fell  as much as 1 percent to 3.87 euros and was
down 0.5 percent as of 9:57 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. That
pared the stock’s gain this year to 3.4 percent.  The company’s capacity reductions will take place starting
in the summer of 2011. In the first nine months of 2010,  Air
Berlin  increased seat capacity by 4.9 percent from a year
earlier, propelled by a 9 percent gain in the third quarter, the
airline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
