JFE Holdings Inc. , a Japanese
engineering company and the country’s second-largest steelmaker,
said it developed a cheaper way to separate and capture
emissions of carbon dioxide.  Tokyo-based JFE’s method cuts the cost of capturing carbon
dioxide to about 2,500 yen ($30) per ton by reducing the amount
of energy and pressure needed to convert the gas into a solid
hydrate for storage, according to a  statement  posted on the
company’s website today.  The process uses a chemical called  Neowhite , which was
developed by JFE and Japan’s  New Energy and Industrial
Technology Development Organization , to make the hydrate form at
a higher temperature when cooling, reducing energy costs, the
statement said.  JFE plans to research the technique for use at power plants
and factories, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
