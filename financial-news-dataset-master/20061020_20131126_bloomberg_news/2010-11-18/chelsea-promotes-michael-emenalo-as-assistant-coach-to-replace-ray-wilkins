Premier League soccer champion
Chelsea named Michael Emenalo assistant first-team coach to
succeed Ray Wilkins, who left last week after his contract
wasn’t renewed. Emenalo was previously the club’s head
opposition scout.                                             “Michael has been an important part of the first-team
management structure since his arrival in October 2007, and his
promotion to assistant first-team coach is recognition of his
efforts to date,” the Blues said on their website.  Chelsea said Emenalo will continue to oversee first-team
scouting as he makes the transition to coaching. Initially,
he’ll split his time between helping coach Carlo Ancelotti
and updating his coaching qualifications.  A former Nigerian international defender, Emenalo joined
Chelsea when it was managed by Avram Grant, with whom he’d
worked during his time as a player at Maccabi Tel Aviv. His
playing career also included spells in the U.S., Belgium, Spain,
Germany and England.  He has a degree in international relations with political
sciences from Boston University, having also played college
soccer in the U.S., Chelsea said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
