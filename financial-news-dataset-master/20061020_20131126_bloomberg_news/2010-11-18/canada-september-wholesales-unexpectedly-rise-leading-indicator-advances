Canadian  wholesale sales 
unexpectedly rose in September on gains in automobiles,
Statistics Canada said, and a leading economic indicator
increased more than expected.  Wholesale sales increased 0.4 percent to C$44.8 billion
($44 billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The gain
matched the highest prediction in a  Bloomberg survey  of 14
economists, which had a median forecast of a 0.3 percent
decline. Aside from motor vehicles, wholesalers recorded a 0.1
percent drop.  The Bank of Canada last month cut its economic growth
forecast in part because of signs of a slower global rebound,
predicting growth would slow in the third quarter to 1.6
percent, its slowest in more than a year.  “If you look outside of the autos, there was no
strength,” said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian fixed income
and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. The
wholesale “report doesn’t change anybody’s fundamental view.”  The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.0184 per
U.S. dollar at 11:41 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0246 yesterday,
when it touched C$1.0262, the weakest level since Oct. 28.  Statistics Canada said separately that its  leading economic
indicator  rose 0.2 percent in October led by stock market gains,
following a revised 0.2 percent September decline. Economists
predicted a 0.1 percent increase based on the median of 11
responses to a Bloomberg survey.  Automobiles  Wholesale sales of motor vehicles and parts rose 2.8
percent to C$7.6 billion in September, Statistics Canada said.
Machinery, equipment and supplies rose 1.1 percent.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the effect of
price changes, rose 0.3 percent.  Inventories  rose 0.5 percent to C$53 billion, the fifth
increase in sixth month, and the inventory-to-sales ratio was
unchanged at 1.18 in September from August.  Statistics Canada revised its estimate of August wholesale
sales increase to 1.3 percent from an initial report of 1.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
