NBC Universal Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey Zucker  said he expects the takeover by  Comcast
Corp . to be completed by yearend.  It could be later than the end of the year, depending on the
regulatory review process, Zucker said today at the Paley Center

the deal closes, said there may be announcements as soon as
today regarding management changes at NBC Universal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
