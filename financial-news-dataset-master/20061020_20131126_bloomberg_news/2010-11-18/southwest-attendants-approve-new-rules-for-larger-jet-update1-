Southwest Airlines Co.  flight
attendants approved contract revisions that will enable the
carrier to buy a larger-model Boeing Co. 737 to carry more
passengers on popular routes.  The vote was 3,126 to 569, the  Transport Workers Union  said
in a statement today. The revisions provide for an additional
attendant on the 175-seat 737-800 and extend the current
contract by one year to 2013.  Southwest, the largest discount carrier, is considering
switching existing orders for some 737-700s to the -800, which
has 28 percent more seats and is more fuel efficient. The
Dallas-based airline is the  largest operator  of Boeing 737s, the
only type of aircraft it flies.  “It’s a vote of confidence in ongoing progress at
Southwest,” Thom McDaniel, president of TWU Local 556, said in
the statement. “We are fully involved in the growth and
expansion of our company.” The union represents 9,700
attendants at the carrier.  The larger  plane  will let Southwest boost seating capacity
even as it holds its fleet of 737s steady, taking new aircraft
only as replacements for older ones. Southwest will also be able
to pack more passengers on high-demand routes and fly to Canada,
Mexico and the Caribbean.  Waiting on Pilots  Southwest said a final decision to add the 737-800 hasn’t
been made as it awaits results of a similar vote by pilots and
continues to evaluate aircraft configuration and network
options. Details of any firm orders with Boeing and the timing
and number of deliveries haven’t been determined, the airline
said.  The changes approved today set out training and schedule
and work rules for attendants on the 737-800s.  The  Southwest Airlines Pilots Association  will announce
results Dec. 1 of their vote on contract provisions for the
bigger jet. Both the attendants’ and pilots’ agreements provide
wage-rate increases linked to Southwest’s financial performance.  Southwest rose 25 cents to $13.56 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  have gained
19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
