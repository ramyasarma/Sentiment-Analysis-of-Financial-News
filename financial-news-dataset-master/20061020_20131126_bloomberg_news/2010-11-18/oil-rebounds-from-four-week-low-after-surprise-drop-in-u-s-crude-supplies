Crude oil increased the most in two
weeks as Ireland moved closer to a European Union-led financial
bailout, strengthening the euro and boosting commodities.  Oil snapped a four-day drop after Ireland’s central bank
governor said he expects the country to seek help. Futures also
rose after a U.S. report yesterday showed crude  supplies 
unexpectedly fell the most since August 2009 and as prices held
above technical support at around $80 a barrel.  “The Ireland data and the dollar have added a little bit
of price support today,” said  Jason Schenker , president of
Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant. “In general, recent market moves may be driven by
technical factors rather than fundamentals, though yesterday’s
inventory report was bullish across the board.”  Crude for December delivery gained $1.41, or 1.8 percent,
to settle at $81.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have risen 2.9 percent in the past year.  Futures touched $80.06 a barrel yesterday, the lowest level
since Oct. 20 and close to the lower limit of its Bollinger
band, or $79.48 a barrel. The Bollinger bands reflect historical
price swings and possible support and resistance levels.  Irish Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said in an
interview with state broadcaster RTE today he expects the
country to ask the EU and the International Monetary Fund for
“tens of billions” of euros to rescue its banks.  Desirable Outcome  “If these talks were to result in a substantial
contingency capital funding” pool that didn’t need to be drawn
down, that “would be a very desirable outcome,” Finance
Minister  Brian Lenihan  said in the Irish parliament in Dublin
today. He said no agreement has been reached.  The dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.3635 per euro at 3:05
p.m. in New York, the biggest decline in two weeks. A weaker
dollar boosts the appeal of commodities as an alternative
investment.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
advanced 2.4 percent to 302.51, the first increase in three
days. Eighteen of the commodities rose.  The Energy Department report yesterday showed crude
supplies fell 7.29 million barrels last week to 357.6 million.
 Imports tumbled  2.8 percent to 7.86 million barrels a day, the
lowest level since December.  $80 Oil  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
“happy” with oil prices above $80 a barrel, said  Mohamed al- Hamli , the oil minister from the United Arab Emirates, the
group’s fourth-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, Iran and
Iraq.  “Everybody is happy about this price,” he said today at
an oil and gas conference in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. “There is
some sort of stability” with oil at $75 to $80 a barrel.  Crude will average $80 a barrel in 2011 and may reach $100
by 2015,  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche
Bank, said today at the 2010 Deloitte Oil & Gas Conference in
Houston. Futures have averaged $78.55 a barrel in New York so
far this year.  U.S. Economy  Oil also rose as the index of U.S. leading indicators
climbed for a fourth consecutive month in October and
manufacturing surged in the Philadelphia area. The U.S. is the
world’s largest oil consumer.  Crude reached $88.63 a barrel last week on an intraday
basis, the highest level since October 2008.  “It will be very difficult for the current world economy
to sustain oil prices above $90 a barrel,”  Olivier Jakob ,
managing director of Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, wrote in a
report received today.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
cut its 2011 global growth forecast today to 4.2 percent from
the 4.5 percent forecast in May, predicting a “soft spot” as
stimulus spending fades before investment spurs a 2012 revival.  The U.S. was estimated to expand 2.7 percent this year,
instead of the 3.2 percent previously predicted, the Paris-based
organization said today in its semi-annual Economic Outlook.
Growth will decelerate further in 2011, when gross domestic
product will increase just 2.2 percent, it said.  GDP in China, the world’s largest energy consumer and
fastest-growing user of oil, was forecast to expand about 10
percent both this year and next, the OECD said.  Brent crude for January settlement increased $1.77, or 2.1
percent, to $85.05 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 598,695
contracts as of 3:07 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 941,801
contracts yesterday, 31 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.43 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
