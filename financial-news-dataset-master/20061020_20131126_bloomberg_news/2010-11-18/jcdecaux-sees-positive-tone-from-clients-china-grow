JCDecaux SA , the world’s second-
largest seller of outdoor advertising, sees a “positive
dynamic” in fourth-quarter business from major clients and is
optimistic about the start of 2011, co-Chief Executive Officer
 Jean-Charles Decaux  said.  JCDecaux is being helped as large ad accounts across its
major markets return to spending, Decaux said in an interview
today on the sidelines of a Morgan Stanley conference in
Barcelona, Spain. The operator of Paris’s Velib bicycle-rental
service on Nov. 3 reported a 27 percent rise in third-quarter
revenue, aided by acquisitions and stronger sales in its
transport and street furniture divisions.  “We are feeling that advertisers still have a positive
dynamic, even if in terms of visibility activity isn’t as strong
as before the crisis,” Decaux said. “It’s a bit early to talk
definitively about the start of 2011, though we’re feeling a
positive tone in the big markets where we operate.”  Advertisers are benefitting as consumer-focused companies
restore marketing budgets slashed during the global recession.
 WPP Plc , the world’s largest advertising company, saw third-
quarter revenue increase 12 percent, beating analyst estimates,
led by improvements in the U.S. and U.K.  JCDecaux also expects “double-digit” growth in China next
year, helped by the spread of its business into secondary cities
and the continued growth of the urban middle class, Decaux said.
Asian countries accounted for about 17 percent of the company’s
revenue in the first half, or about 186 million euros ($253.5
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
