Jason Schechter , a managing director
and structured credit trader, including collateralized loan
obligations at Barclays Capital, has left to join UBS AG,
according to people familiar with the move.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Issuance of the debt has doubled this year over 2009 after
Guggenheim Investment Management LLC’s $600 million CLO priced
earlier this week, pushing volume to $2.6 billion of deals
backed by widely syndicated loans.  Schechter; Brandon Ashcraft, a Barclays spokesman; and Kris
Kagel, a UBS spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
