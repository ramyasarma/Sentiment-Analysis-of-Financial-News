China’s banking regulator may limit
 new lending  to 6.6 trillion yuan ($994 billion) for 2011, down
12 percent from this year’s target, as it gets “more serious”
about combating  inflation , Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission’s announcement,
expected in December, will be a bearish catalyst for the overall
equity market as well as the banks as it’s lower than the
consensus forecast of 7 trillion yuan to 7.5 trillion yuan of
new loan growth for next year, Bernstein’s Hong Kong-based
analysts  Michael Werner  and Wangshu Qiu said.  “For the People’s Bank of China to win the battle over
inflation, it will have to slow money growth,” the analysts
wrote in a note today. They expect the annual new loan target to
be 6.5 trillion yuan to 7.5 trillion yuan through 2015.  China’s inflation accelerated to 4.4 percent in October,
the fastest pace in two years, bolstering the case for the
policy makers to do more to soak up liquidity and cool the
economy. The central bank last month raised interest rates for
the first time since 2007 and required banks to set aside more
deposits as  reserves  last week.  The regulator said the annual loan growth target is set by
the central bank, whose Beijing-based press official wasn’t
immediately available for a comment.  Concerns on inflation have sent the  Shanghai Composite
Index  down 10 percent from a seven-month high on Nov. 8. China’s
cabinet said yesterday price caps on “important daily
necessities” and production materials will be used when
necessary.  ‘True’ Loan Growth  Chinese banks have advanced about 6.9 trillion yuan of new
loans this year, according to central bank data, approaching the
government’s cap of 7.5 trillion yuan for all of this year.
Lenders may offer an additional 800 billion yuan for the rest of
the year, bringing the total to 7.7 trillion yuan, according to
Bernstein.  Loan growth for the banking system in 2010 is “much
higher” than the official figure as approximately 1.5 trillion
of loans were made off the balance sheets of the Chinese banks,
the analysts said.  The banking regulator in August ordered lenders to transfer
off-the-balance loans onto their books by the end of 2011 and
make provisions equal to 150 percent of potential losses.  -- Luo Jun . Editors:  Linus Chua ,  James Gunsalus   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
