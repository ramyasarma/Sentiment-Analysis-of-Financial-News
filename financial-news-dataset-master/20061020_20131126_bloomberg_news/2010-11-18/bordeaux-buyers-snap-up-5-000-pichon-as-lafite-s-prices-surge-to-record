The message from wine investors in
London is there’s more to  Bordeaux  than Chateau Lafite.  While the Rothschild-owned vineyard is setting records at
auction, demand for the region’s top wines is reflected in a
price surge for Chateau Pichon-Longueville, a 300-year-old Medoc
wine estate.  Prices for top Bordeaux have soared this year, propelled by
demand from China and a jump in the market for 2009 futures on
sale since June. Pichon 1990 climbed to an average $3,694 a case
in Europe last month among brokers, up 22 percent from a year
earlier, according to the London-based Liv-ex wine exchange. A
case of the same vintage fetched as much as $5,377.50 at a  Hart
Davis Hart Wine Co.  auction in Chicago in September.  “Pichon is an extraordinary story,” said  Peter Lunzer ,
chief executive officer of  Lunzer Wine Investments , a London-
based fund backed by Richmond Park Capital LLP. “The amount of
money they have spent on it is eye-watering. There is potential
for price appreciation.”  Other Pichon-Longueville vintages are in demand. A case of
1989 sold for $4,270 at  Acker Merrall & Condit  in Hong Kong on
March 26, and three cases of the 2000 fetched $3,050 each at
Acker in Hong Kong on May 28.  The  Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Investables Index  has risen 33
percent since the start of this year; Pichon 2000 has risen 28
percent in Europe over the same period, based on broker prices.  Gironde Gravel       Pichon-Longueville , formerly known as Chateau Pichon-
Longueville Baron, is an estate stretching over 73 hectares in
the southern part of Pauillac, on the gravel of the Gironde
estuary’s left bank. It was bought in 1987 by  Axa Millesimes , a
division of French insurer  Axa SA  set up to manage vineyards.  “When we acquired Pichon it was symptomatic of Bordeaux at
that time,” said Christian Seely, managing director of Axa
Millesimes. “It had 20 years of serious decline.”  Pichon-Longueville’s vineyards comprise 62 percent Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes, 35 percent Merlot and 3 percent Cabernet
Franc. The property is dominated by an 1840s chateau. Pichon
doesn’t disclose how much has been invested.  Its wine-making dates back to the late 17th century, when
it formed a single property with what is now the estate of
 Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande . The land was divided in
1850 after Baron Joseph de Pichon-Longueville died. Its
neighbors include  Chateau Latour  and Chateau Leoville Las Cases.  “What we try to do is pick up underperforming jewels,
which Pichon certainly was,” Seely said. “That’s a 20-year
program. It started in 1987 and hopefully we’re getting there.”  Based on  Liv-ex list prices  for the 1990 vintage, Pichon-
Longueville ranks third among the 14 second-growths of the left
bank, after Montrose and Leoville Las Cases.  First Growths  In price, most second-growths trail the five left-bank
first growths Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild, Latour,
Margaux and Haut-Brion, as well as La Mission-Haut-Brion and
right-bank producers Petrus,  Cheval Blanc , Le Pin and Lafleur.  Lafite is attracting most headlines and setting auction
records, notably a world-beating $233,000 last month in Hong
Kong for each of three bottles from its 1869 vintage. The
broader Bordeaux market benefits from the interest.  For Pichon-Longueville, the most obvious competition is
from its former sibling Lalande, which it faces across the road
winding through the vineyards of the Medoc.  While Pichon-Longueville’s 1990 vintage sells for more than
double the price of Lalande’s, its sibling has pulled ahead in
years such as 2000, 2003 and 2009. According to Liv-ex,
Lalande’s millennial vintage is priced at 1,770 pounds ($2,818),
31 percent more than Pichon-Longueville.  “Lalande normally goes for a premium,” said  William Beck ,
partner of  Wine Asset Managers LLP , which has $25 million of
wine under management in two funds.  Champagne house  Louis Roederer  acquired Lalande in 2007
from May-Eliane de Lencquesaing. She ran the estate for almost
30 years. Her father bought it in 1924.  U.S.  wine  critic  Robert Parker  rates the 1990 Pichon-
Longueville “one of this estate’s two or three finest wines
made in the last 40 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
