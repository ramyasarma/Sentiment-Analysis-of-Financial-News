Japan’s bonds declined for a second
day as domestic shares climbed and demand fell at a 1.1
trillion-yen ($13.2 billion) sale of 20-year debt today.  Benchmark 10-year yields reached a two-month high as the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose past 10,000 for the first time
since June. The debt auction drew bids valued at 2.54 times the
amount on offer, the least since December 2009. Bonds also fell
before reports forecast to show increases in an index of U.S.
leading economic indicators and Philadelphia-area manufacturing.  “A gain in stocks depresses bond investors’ sentiment,”
said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan
Securities Co. “The atmosphere is bad in the bond market.”  The  yield  on benchmark 10-year bond jumped 4.5 basis points
to 1.105 percent, the most since Sept. 14, as of 3:27 p.m. at
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The 1 percent note due September 2020 fell 0.396 yen to
99.069 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery declined 0.51
to 141.45 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The  yield spread  between Japan’s 20- and 10-year bonds was
about 85 basis points. It expanded to 90 basis points on Nov.
12, the widest since March 2008.  “It’s a question of whether 10-year bonds are overvalued
or super-long debt is undervalued,” said Okasan’s Bandou.
“Because sentiment is bad, investors are prone to sell
overvalued assets.”  The lowest accepted price at the 20-year debt auction was
99.70, lower than the 99.90 estimated by traders in a Bloomberg
survey.  Debt Sales  Japan’s bond sales may increase at a slower pace next
fiscal year, easing concern supply will outstrip demand,
according to Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. Bond and note sales will likely
grow by 3.6 trillion yen, or about 2.5 percent, in the year
starting April 2011, according to the companies, which are among
Japan’s 24 primary dealers.  Declines in Japanese debt coincided with drops in U.S.
Treasuries. The U.S. Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for
the next three to six months rose 0.5 percent in October, the
biggest gain since May, based on a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index increased to 5 in November from 1 a month earlier, another
survey showed. Another report today may say jobless claims last
week held near a four-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
