The dollar may fall below 75 yen
next year as it becomes the world’s “weakest currency” due to
the Federal Reserve’s monetary-easing program, according to
JPMorgan & Chase Co.  The U.S. central bank, along with those in Japan and Europe,
will keep interest rates at record lows in 2011 as they seek to
boost economic growth, said  Tohru Sasaki , head of Japanese rates
and foreign-exchange research at the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets. U.S. policy makers may take additional easing steps
following the $600 billion bond-purchase program announced this
month depending on inflation and the labor market, he said.  “The U.S. has the world’s largest current-account deficit
but keeps interest rates at virtually zero,” Sasaki said at a
forum in Tokyo yesterday. “The dollar can’t avoid the status as
the weakest currency.”  The Fed said on Nov. 3 it will buy $75 billion of
Treasuries a month through June to cap borrowing costs. The
central bank has kept its  benchmark rate  in a range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008. The Bank of Japan on Oct. 5
cut its key rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent and set up a
5 trillion yen ($59.9 billion) asset-purchase fund.  The dollar traded at 83.38 yen as of 12:04 p.m. in Tokyo
after falling to a 15-year low of 80.22 on Nov. 1. The greenback
declined to post-World War II low of 79.75 yen in April 1995.
The U.S. currency has declined against 12 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tightening Unnecessary  There’s no need for any monetary tightening in the U.S. as
even prolonged easing won’t heighten inflationary pressures with
the balance sheets of banks and households still hurting from
the fallout of the global financial crisis, Sasaki said.  Ten-year Treasury  yields  may decline to around 2.25 percent
over the next year, and their premium over similar-maturity
 Japanese yields  won’t widen, he said. The benchmark 10-year
Treasury yielded 2.89 percent today.  The world economy is likely to expand 3 percent next year
amid the extra liquidity provided by central banks, “repeating
a pattern from early 2002 to the end of 2004” when improving
risk appetite boosted stocks and commodities and the dollar fell
25 percent against the yen, Sasaki said.  With monetary easing in the U.S., Japan and Europe likely
to bolster the global recovery and increase demand for yield,
the yen is poised to weaken against other currencies beside the
dollar to levels last seen in early 2007, Sasaki said.  Japan will refrain from selling the yen even if it
strengthens against the dollar, following international
criticism of foreign-exchange intervention, he said. The nation
intervened in the currency markets for the first time in six
years on Sept. 15 when the yen climbed to a 15-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
