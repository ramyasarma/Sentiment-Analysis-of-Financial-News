The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is proposing to lower costs for delivering renewable
energy by permitting more frequent transmission scheduling.  The agency is considering a rule that would allow power-
transmission providers to set schedules in 15-minute intervals
instead of hourly, FERC Chairman  Jon Wellinghoff  said today at a
commission meeting in Washington.  The goal is to let transmission companies plan more
accurately and encourage using power from wind farms and solar-
energy panels, which are volatile sources, the agency said.
Providers would be able to reduce their contracts for stand-by
supplies, such as plants burning natural gas, FERC said.  “Most of the new power plants for which developers are
seeking access to the grid are variable resources such as wind
and solar generators,” Wellinghoff said. “This proposal will
help the commission to cost-effectively integrate these and
other variable generators into the grid in a way that helps
maintain reliability and operational stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
