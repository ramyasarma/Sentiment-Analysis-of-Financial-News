LPL Investment Holdings Inc. , the
brokerage and investment advisory firm owned by TPG Capital and
Hellman & Friedman LLC, raised $470 million after selling its
initial public offering at the top of the forecast range.  LPL gained as much as 13 percent to $33.84 as of 11:13 a.m.
in New York in its debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Boston-
based company sold 15.66 million shares for $30 each yesterday
after offering 15.61 million shares at $27 to $30 apiece,
according to a statement and data compiled by Bloomberg. LPL
intends to use the proceeds to pay debt, its filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  LPL was one of at least four companies backed by private
equity firms scheduled to sell shares in the biggest week for
U.S. IPOs since March 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The offering came after the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  halted its longest stretch of declines in three months and
General Motors Co. raised more than $20 billion selling common
and preferred shares to help repay its taxpayer bailout.  “It shows that investors are still enthusiastic for new
issues,” said  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at Chicago-
based Harris Private Bank, which oversees $55 billion.  At the midpoint price of $28.50, LPL would have been valued
at 38 times this year’s estimated earnings, according to a
report by IPOdesktop.com of Marina del Rey, California.  That’s higher than the median 23.5 times estimated 2010
profit for 23 investment banks and brokerages listed on U.S.
exchanges, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Private Equity Deals  LPL had $2.29 billion in sales in the first nine months of
this year, 14 percent more than in the same period a year ago,
the prospectus said. Net income more than doubled.  TPG of Fort Worth, Texas, and San Francisco-based Hellman &
Friedman, each owned 36 percent of LPL. Neither buyout firm
intended to sell shares and would have retained a combined 64
percent stake, based on the original terms of the IPO.  New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley
led LPL’s offering.  The sale came one day after Carlyle Group’s  Booz Allen
Hamilton Holding Corp.  completed its IPO. The McLean, Virginia-
based government-consulting firm acquired by Carlyle in 2008
rose 13 percent yesterday after its $238 million offering.  Two more private-equity backed sales are scheduled today.
 Aeroflex Holding Corp. , owned by San Francisco-based Golden Gate
Capital, Veritas Capital of New York and a buyout fund run by
 Goldman Sachs , will offer 17.25 million shares at $13.50 to
$15.50, its filing said.  Harrah’s Offering  The maker of semiconductors and testing equipment hasn’t
posted a  profit  since it was taken private in August 2007. IPO
buyers are being asked to spend 141 percent more than the
average price that current investors paid for their stakes, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Harrah’s Entertainment Inc. , the world’s biggest casino
company, will sell 31.3 million shares for $15 to $17 each, its
filing said. The Las Vegas-based company will change its name to
Caesars Entertainment Corp. before the IPO.  Leon Black’s  New York-based Apollo Global Management LLC
and  David Bonderman’s  TPG took Harrah’s private for $30.7
billion, including debt and transaction costs, in January 2008.  Zogenix Inc., the San Diego-based company that sells a
treatment for migraine and cluster headaches, and Lizhan
Environmental Corp., the Tongxiang, China-based maker of
synthetic leather from recycled leather waste, will also attempt
IPOs today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The sales are among 10 initial offerings that were
scheduled for this week. The largest came from  GM , which sold
$15.8 billion of common shares yesterday, according to a
statement. That’s more than the $10.6 billion the Detroit-based
company initially sought, according data compiled by Bloomberg.
The automaker also sold $4.35 billion of preferred stock.  The sale of common shares was the second-largest in U.S.
history after San Francisco-based  Visa Inc.’s  $19.7 billion
offering in March 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  GM’s shares climbed as much as 9.1 percent to $35.99 in New
York Stock Exchange trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
