South Africa has commissioned a
study into the level of black participation in the nation’s oil
industry to help determine whether a 25 percent black-ownership
target is appropriate, Energy Minister  Dipuo Peters  said.  The goal was set in the Petroleum and Liquid Fuels Charter,
which was adopted a decade ago and sought to address the
exclusion of members of the black majority from the oil industry
before the end of white minority rule in 1994.  The charter also required oil companies to hire and promote
more black staff and increase their level of procurement from
black-owned companies.  The government hasn’t conducted “annual industry surveys
to monitor and evaluate progress” in implementing the charter,
Peters told reporters in Cape Town today. “The audit outcome
will give us an indication of the route to go. Do we increase
the percentage or what is it that we need to do?”  The study, to be undertaken auditing firm  Moloto Solutions ,
is due be completed by March.  “Virtually all the oil companies right now have done some
form of deal” to ensure they have 25 percent black ownership,
said Maurice Radebe, president of the  South African Petroleum
Industry Association , an industry body. “The assessment can go
into the nature of the deals” and determine whether they were
sustainable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
