Ghana , the West African nation that
will start production of oil for export next month, plans to
narrow its fiscal deficit in the next three years as revenue
from the energy industry builds up, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said.  The cash budget deficit will narrow to 7.5 percent of gross
domestic product next year from about 9.7 percent in 2010,
Duffuor told Parliament in the capital, Accra, today. It will
drop to 4.7 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013, he said.  “We are ready to make the transition from stability to
accelerated growth,” he said in a speech that outlined spending
plans for 2011.  The country’s economy is set to expand 12.3 percent in
2011, Duffuor said, as production begins at the Jubilee oil
field that will make Ghana one of the world’s top 50 crude
producers. The field will initially produce about 50,000 barrels
of oil a day in December, rising to 120,000 barrels a day over
the next three to six months, according to  Tullow Oil Plc , the
field’s operator  Ghana will earn 584 million cedis ($406 million) from oil
in 2011, with total oil and non-oil revenue projected at 10.6
billion cedis, or 34 percent of GDP, Duffuor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
