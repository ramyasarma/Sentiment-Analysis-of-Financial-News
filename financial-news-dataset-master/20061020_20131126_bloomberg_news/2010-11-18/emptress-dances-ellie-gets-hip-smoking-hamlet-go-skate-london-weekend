Ellie Goulding  brings her quirky mix
of folk and electronica to London -- capping a year in which
she’s gone from university dropout to best-selling artist.  “Lights,” the 23-year-old’s debut album, shifted 400,000
copies in a week as she became hip. Expect to hear her biggest
hit, “Starry Eyed,” and new single, a reworking of  Elton John’s  “Your Song.”  HMV Hammersmith Apollo, 45 Queen Caroline Street, London,
W6 9QH. Information:  http://venues.meanfiddler.com/apollo/home 
or +44-844-844-474.  As a Friday-night alternative, watch a temptress in a
sequined mini-skirt use drink to tame a prosperous lecher. Love
triumphs over money in the  Royal Ballet’s  “Sylvia,” with
principal  Sarah Lamb  as the huntress nymph. Information:
 http://www.roh.org.uk  or call +44-20-7304-4000.  You can eat well at the Amphitheatre Restaurant without
leaving the Opera House. If you want a treat nearby, Rules
offers classic British cooking and bills itself as London’s
oldest restaurant:  http://www.rules.co.uk/   Saturday  English has come a long way since “Beowulf.” A  British
Library  show plots the trajectory, and the language’s many uses:
for preaching, for swearing, and, this being England, for
separating the classes.  A Victorian manual aimed at the upwardly mobile recommends
dropping the ‘h’ in ‘hospital’ and ‘humour.’ A 1950s text rates
‘greens’ and ‘toilet paper’ as ‘non-U’ (i.e. non-upper-class).  Also on display: Joyce’s neatly handwritten manuscript of
“Finnegans Wake” -- easy to read, much harder to understand.  Information:  http://www.bl.uk  or call +44-20-7412-7111.  Saturday Night  Hamlet wears sweat pants and smokes a lot in a new staging.  Shakespeare’s famous Dane lives in a modern-day police
state, full of spooks in hi-tech ear gear, where Claudius looks
much like Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  Actor Rory Kinnear delivers the killer line -- “To be or
not to be” -- puffing on a cigarette.  “Hamlet,” directed by  Nicholas Hytner , is at the  National
Theatre . Information:  http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk  or call
+44-20-7452-3000.  Inside the theater, Mezzanine serves modern European food,
with two courses for 25.95 pounds. There’s also a three-course
lunch option, with a backstage tour thrown in, for 35 pounds:

restaurants, including Wagamama, Canteen and Yo! Sushi:

of the London Eye, the capital’s fancy ferris wheel. Skates are
provided. If you want to see the city from up high, you can do
both, though not simultaneously -- and it’ll cost you.  Adult tickets for the Eyeskate rink only are 10.50 pounds
($17) if you buy online. Combo tickets start at 26.65 pounds.  Information:  http://www.londoneye.com  or +44-871-222-4002.  ( Farah Nayeri  writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
