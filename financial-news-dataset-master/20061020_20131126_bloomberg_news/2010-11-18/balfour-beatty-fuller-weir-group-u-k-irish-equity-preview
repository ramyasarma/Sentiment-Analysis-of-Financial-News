U.K. stocks fell amid concern
Europe’s resurgent sovereign-debt crisis may derail the region’s
recovery and as China raised its reserve ratio requirement for
banks to drain cash from the economy.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc lost more
than 1 percent.  Hammerson Plc  retreated as Morgan Stanley
downgraded the U.K.’s third-largest publicly traded property
company. Rio Tinto Group followed European basic-resource shares
lower.  Biocompatibles International Plc  surged as BTG Plc agreed
to buy the company.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  Index dropped 0.6 percent to
5,732.83 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has lost
1.1 percent this week as Ireland held talks with the European
Union and International Monetary Fund over a bailout. The FTSE
All-Share Index declined 0.6 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index climbed 0.8 percent.  “The western world remains on life support,”  Jim Reid , a
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a report
today. “Eventually bigger entities than Irish banks will likely
be the target.”  Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  is edging toward accepting
a rescue package that may threaten the country’s low-tax
policies and put voters on the hook to repay loans the central
bank says may be worth “tens of billions” of euros. Officials
from the EU and the IMF are in Dublin to assess the books of the
country’s banks.  Banks Slide  HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, fell 1.4 percent to 657.5
pence, while  Lloyds , the U.K.’s largest mortgage lender,
retreated 1.6 percent to 66.72 pence. A gauge of European
banking shares dropped 1.6 percent today, the worst performance
among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Rio Tinto , the world’s third-biggest mining company, lost
1.2 percent to 4,230 pence, while BHP Billiton Ltd., the
largest, dropped 1.4 percent to 2,332.5 pence. Basic-resource
shares were the second-biggest decliners in the Stoxx 600.   China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves for the
fifth time this year, draining cash from the financial system to
limit inflation and asset-bubble risks in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy.  The ratio will increase 50 basis points starting Nov. 29,
the central bank said on its website today. The aim is to step
up liquidity management and “appropriately control” credit and
loans, it said.  Hammerson, Capita  Hammerson dropped 1.8 percent to 403.8 pence as Morgan
Stanley downgraded the stock to “equal weight” from
“overweight.”  Capita Group Plc, which provides a criminal records service
for the U.K. Home Office, lost 1.9 percent to 677 pence as HSBC
downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral.”  Rolls-Royce Group Plc , which provides engines for Airbus
A380 jets, declined 1.9 percent to 592 pence. Qantas Airways
Ltd. may ground its fleet of Airbus SAS A380s for “several more
weeks” as it continues to check engines on the jets, Reuters
reported, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
situation.  Biocompatibles shares surged 16 percent to 391 pence, the
highest price in 10 years. BTG, the maker of the experimental
varicose-vein treatment Varisolve, said it has agreed to buy
Biocompatibles for 430 pence a share, comprised of new stock and
10 pence in cash. BTG sank 7.7 percent to 231.6 pence, the
biggest decline since May.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
