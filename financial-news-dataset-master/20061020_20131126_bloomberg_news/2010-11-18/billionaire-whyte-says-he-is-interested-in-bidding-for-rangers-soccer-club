Craig Whyte said he is in talks with
Murray International Holdings Ltd. to acquire a majority stake
in Rangers Football Club.  “Whyte confirms that he is considering making an offer for
RFC and is in talks with MIH but that these are at an early
stage and there can be no certainty that an offer will
ultimately be made,” the Scottish billionaire said today in a
PR Newswire statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
