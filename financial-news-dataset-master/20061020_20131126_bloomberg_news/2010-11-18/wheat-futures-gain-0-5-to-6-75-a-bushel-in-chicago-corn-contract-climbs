Soybeans rose the most in seven
sessions and corn gained on speculation global production will
decline and demand will rise.  World grain production may slide 2.1 percent in the current
crop year, down from a June outlook for a 1.2 percent increase,
the Rome-based United Nations’ Food and Agricultural
Organization said in a  report  yesterday. China is expected to
import 57 million metric tons of soybeans, up 13 percent from a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “We think U.S. corn and soybean supplies will continue
tightening, while even currently high prices are not enough to
put a serious brake on demand,”  Alex Bos  at Macquarie Bank Ltd.
in London said in a report. Analysts at the bank expect a
“significant improvement in the U.S. corn export pace into
early-2011.”  Soybeans for January delivery rose 27.75 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $12.3275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has jumped 18 percent this
year on greater demand from China.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 16.25 cents, or 3
percent, to $5.555 a bushel in Chicago. The price has risen 37
percent since the end of July, shortly before Russia announced
it would ban exports after its worst drought in 50 years.  The March-delivery wheat contract gained 21.25 cents, or
3.2 percent, to $6.9275 a bushel in Chicago. The price is up 44
percent since the end of June because of the Russian drought.
Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
added as much as 1.8 percent to 216.50 euros ($295.24) a ton.  Global output of cereals, including wheat and corn, will
drop to 2.216 billion tons in the 2010-2011 season from 2.263
billion tons a year earlier, the FAO said in a report yesterday.  “We believe the crop size for next year will be critical
in setting the tone for stability in international markets,”
