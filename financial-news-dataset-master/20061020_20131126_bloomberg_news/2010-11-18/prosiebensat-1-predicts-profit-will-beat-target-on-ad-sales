ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG  Chief
Executive Officer  Thomas Ebeling  predicts Germany’s biggest
private broadcaster’s full-year operating profit will exceed its
target because of booming advertising sales.  “It will be a bit more,” Ebling said at a Morgan Stanley
conference in Barcelona today when asked whether the company
would meet its full-year target for earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 850 million euros.  “I’d say it will be between 850 and 880, probably closer
to the upper end of this range,” he said. Ebeling also said he
expects German free TV sales to grow by a “solid mid-single
digit” percentage in the fourth quarter.  The broadcaster, which operates the ProSieben, Sat.1 and
Kabel 1 channels, is benefitting from rising ad sales as
companies increase marketing budgets in an improving economy. Ad
markets have rebounded faster than expected, ad-buying agency
ZenithOptimedia Group Ltd. said last month, lifting its 2010
growth forecast for the third time this year.  ProSiebenSat.1 this month reported third-quarter operating
profit and sales that beat analyst estimates. Ebitda rose 64
percent from a year earlier to 154.9 million euros. Revenue
gained 12 percent to 626.9 million euros. The average estimate
of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for profit on that basis
at 139.6 million euros.  Company History  Private equity firms  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co . and
Permira LLP agreed to buy control of ProSiebenSat.1, based in
Unterfoehring near Munich, at the end of 2006. The following
year, they combined ProSiebenSat.1 with SBS, another company
they control and which runs TV stations and radio networks in
Scandinavia, Belgium, Netherlands and southeastern Europe.  KKR and Permira want to sell the broadcaster while the
advertising market is booming, Reuters reported this month,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. A sale
of ProSiebenSat.1 may prove difficult, making a public offering
more likely, Reuters said, adding that nothing had yet been
decided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
