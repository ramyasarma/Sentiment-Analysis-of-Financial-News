Olympia Capital Holdings Ltd., a
Kenyan maker of building materials, posted a first-half loss of
2.83 million shillings ($35,286) because of losses at its South
African businesses.  Revenue in the six months through August was 381.4 million
shillings, the Nairobi-based company said in a statement to the
city’s stock exchange today. It didn’t provide comparative
figures for the same period a year earlier.  “Following the pickup in sales in the second half in South
Africa, we are confident that in the full year, the loss will
cease to exist,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
