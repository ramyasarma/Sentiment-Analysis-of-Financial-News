CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, is negotiating long-term contracts for pre-
sale of electricity with European investment banks, Trading
Director  Alan Svoboda  said.  Contracts for the sale of electricity from CEZ’s coal power
plants at a fixed price for as long as 10 years will help the
utility hedge against unstable power price fluctuations on the
market and ensure more stable results, Svoboda said in a phone
interview today.  “We are talking to a number of partners,” the executive
said. “These will be pilot projects. We are talking about
contracts for output of up to 100 megawatts a year.”  Morgan Stanley and Credit Agricole SA are among the banks
negotiating with CEZ,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported today, citing
people familiar with the matter.  CEZ, which generates a large part of its power production
from its own coal, is very exposed to market power price
fluctuations, Svoboda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
