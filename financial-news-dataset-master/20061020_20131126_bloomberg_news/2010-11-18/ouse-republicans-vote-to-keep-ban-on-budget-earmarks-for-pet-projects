U.S. House Republicans voted to
continue for the next two years their ban on budget “earmarks”
that direct money to lawmakers’ pet projects, joining Senate
Republicans who adopted a similar policy earlier this week.  “This earmark ban shows the American people we are
listening and we are dead serious about ending business as usual
in Washington,” Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio, who
will become speaker in January, said in a statement.
House Republicans also had adopted a no-earmarks policy for its
caucus during the current congressional session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
