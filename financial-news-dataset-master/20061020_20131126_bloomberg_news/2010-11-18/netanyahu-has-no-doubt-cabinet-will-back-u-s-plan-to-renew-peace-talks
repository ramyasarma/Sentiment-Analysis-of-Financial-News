Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said “we are in intensive contacts with the U.S.
government” to finalize a proposal intended to lead to a
renewal of peace talks with the Palestinians.  As soon as Netanyahu receives the U.S. proposal he will
present it to the security cabinet where he has “no doubt” it
will be accepted, the Prime Minister said. Netanyahu’s comments,
given in a speech today he made in the northern Israeli city of
Haifa, were sent in a statement from his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
