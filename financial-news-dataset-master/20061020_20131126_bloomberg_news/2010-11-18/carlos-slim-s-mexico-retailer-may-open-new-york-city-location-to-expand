Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Mexican
retail chain is considering opening a location in New York City
to expand in the U.S.  Sanborns, the retailer owned by Slim’s  Grupo Carso SAB ,
hasn’t made a final decision on the location,  Arturo Elias ,
Slim’s spokesman and son-in-law, said in an e-mail. He didn’t
provide a timeframe in which the company would decide.  New York would be the first U.S. market for  Sanborns . The
chain has about 160 locations in Mexico, selling books,
televisions and chocolates.  In Mexico, most Sanborns locations house a restaurant
selling traditional Mexican food and a bar. The retail chain,
founded in 1903 and acquired by Slim in 1985, had sales of 10.2
billion pesos ($825 million) last year, almost all from Mexico,
according to Grupo Carso’s  annual report .  Slim has boosted his real-estate investments this year in
New York. He was part of a group of investors who paid $44
million for a townhouse on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue in July. His
family’s closely held investment vehicle, Inmobiliaria Carso SA,
also bought an office tower at 417 Fifth Ave. for $140 million
in June.  Slim, a New York Yankees fan, is the biggest shareholder in
New York-based luxury retailer Saks Inc. and holds a stake in
publisher New York Times Co. Reuters reported Sanborns’s New
York City plans earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
