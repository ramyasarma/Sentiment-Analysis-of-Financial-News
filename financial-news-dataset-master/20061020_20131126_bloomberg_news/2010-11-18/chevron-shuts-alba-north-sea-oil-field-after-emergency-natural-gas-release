Chevron Corp.’s North Sea Alba oil
field remains closed after an “emergency shutdown” yesterday
following a gas release, Sam Howard, a company spokesman, said
by phone today from Aberdeen, Scotland.  “The 135 personnel on board at the time went to muster and
all are accounted for, with no injuries. The muster was stood
down by 4:15 p.m.,” according to an e-mailed statement from the
company.  The Alba field produced about 32,000 barrels of oil a day
last year, according to Chevron. It has no associated gas
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
