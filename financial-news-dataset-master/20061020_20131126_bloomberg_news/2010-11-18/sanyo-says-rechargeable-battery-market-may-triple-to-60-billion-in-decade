Sanyo Electric Co.  expects the
global lithium-ion battery market will more than triple to 5
trillion yen ($60 billion) in 10 years, driven by demand from
power companies and electric cars.  “Power companies in the U.S. are likely to install more
energy storage systems to boost demand for rechargeable
batteries,”  Mitsuru Honma , head of Sanyo’s energy business,
told reporters in Tokyo today.  Batteries for large-scale power storage systems will
grow to at least to 2 trillion yen globally, while those used
in environment-friendly cars will probably total 1.5 trillion
yen, Honma said. Consumer electronics will account for the
remaining 1.5 trillion yen, he said.  Global shipments of the power cells will probably total
1.5 trillion yen in the year ending March 2011, Honma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
