Asia gasoil swaps dropped the most
in five months in Singapore as the crack spread narrowed,
signaling reduced profit from making diesel. Fuel oil swaps slid
after crude futures fell to a four-week low yesterday.  Gasoil, or diesel, prices slumped even as China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., the country’s
largest oil trader, said it will boost diesel imports for a
second month in December to ease a domestic shortage.  Middle Distillates  December  gasoil  swaps dropped $3.70, or 3.8 percent, to
$94.20 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a
brokerage. That’s the biggest decline since June 7. The
product’s premium to Dubai crude, or the  crack spread , was down
86 cents at $13.03, the lowest since Nov. 8.  China International, or Unipec, plans to import 120,000
metric tons for December delivery, compared with 80,000 tons in
November, according to an official with knowledge of the
transactions, who declined to be identified because of company
policy.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil increased 10 cents to $1.05 a
barrel, PVM data showed. The  regrade  was at the widest in a
week, meaning it’s more profitable to produce aviation fuel
compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for December fell $20, or 4
percent, to $478.25 a ton at 12:20 p.m. in Singapore, Asia’s
biggest oil-trading hub, according to PVM. That’s the biggest
drop since Feb. 5.  Crude futures yesterday declined for a fourth day in New
York, trading near $80 a barrel. Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai
crude widened 24 cents to $7.59 a barrel, indicating losses from
making the residue were the largest in a week.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was down 25 cents at $9.75 a ton, PVM data
showed. The so-called  viscosity spread  has narrowed 4.9 percent
in the past two weeks, signaling bunker, or marine fuel, has
dropped less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half December delivery were bid at $780 a
ton against offers at $783, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s down from a close of $794.50 on
Nov. 16, the most recent day when prices were assessed.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rebounded to $4.80 a barrel
on Nov. 16, Bloomberg calculations showed. A widening reforming
margin shows motor fuel is profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
