Britain’s energy-market regulator
invited companies to tender for a 1.9 billion-pound ($3 billion)
contract to run transmission links between six offshore wind
farms and the national grid, the Financial Times reported.  The wind farms will be capable of generating 2,800
megawatts of electricity, the newspaper said.  Balfour Beatty Capital Ltd., Macquarie Capital Group Ltd.
and Transmission Capital Partners won a contract to run the
links for seven other wind projects, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
