Democrats and Republicans still have
time during the current session to reach a compromise on
extending soon-to-expire Bush-era tax cuts, the Senate’s No. 2
Democrat said today.  “I’m just hoping that once the Republicans get home for
Thanksgiving and get some cranberry relish or whatever it is,
they’re going to be in a better mood about sitting down and
talking,” Senator  Richard Durbin  said on Bloomberg TV in
Washington.  The tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 are scheduled to
expire Dec. 31. Unless Congress acts, marginal income tax rates
will rise across the board, tax credits that benefit families
will be slashed and rates on capital gains and dividends will
increase.  President  Barack Obama  wants to extend all the tax cuts
except for those earning more than $250,000 a year. Republicans
support extending all the tax cuts.  In the interview, Durbin, of Illinois, also said he favored
more tax increases and fewer spending cuts than were recommended
by a presidential debt commission.  “Seventy-five percent” of the deficit reduction in the
debt commission’s plan “comes from spending cuts, 25 percent
from revenue increases,” he said. “That mix needs to be
adjusted. I think it needs to be closer to 60-40, maybe even
lower than that.”  On the morning of General Motors Co. returning to public
trading following bankruptcy, Durbin said he wanted all money
from a taxpayer bailout of the Detroit-based company repaid.  “We want the money paid back, period,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
