Dick Clark Productions Inc. , the
producer of the annual  Golden Globe Awards  show, was accused in
a lawsuit by the event’s organizer of licensing broadcasts of it
without authorization.  The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has
organized the show since 1944, accuses  Dick Clark Productions  of
trademark infringement and breach of contract, among other
claims, in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Los
Angeles. The association seeks a court order blocking a
licensing agreement between Dick Clark Productions and the NBC
network.  “DCP has absolutely no right under the awards agreement to
grant television broadcast licenses to future Golden Globe
Awards shows without HFPA’s knowledge and authorization,” the
association said in the complaint.  Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Red Zone Capital
Partners II LP, said in a statement that the lawsuit had no
merit.  “Our respective rights under the contract are clear,” the
production company said. “The HFPA cannot unilaterally change
the basis on which DCP and the HFPA have done business for
almost three decades.”  The case is Hollywood Foreign Press Association v. Red Zone
Capital Partners, 10-08833, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
