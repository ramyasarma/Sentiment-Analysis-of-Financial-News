Copper in Shanghai rallied after
falling 11 percent in four days and London prices extended
yesterday’s gains as China’s clarification on price controls
improved investor confidence and as the dollar weakened.  February-delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed 1.9 percent to close at 62,720 a ton. The three-month
delivery contract in London advanced 1.5 percent to $8,310 a ton
at 3:10 p.m. in Shanghai. Zinc gained 3.6 percent to $2,189.  “As news about how Beijing plans to curb inflation came
out, it helped to alleviate the policy uncertainties, giving
some relief to the market,”  Ren Gang , an analyst at Maike
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  China’s State Council said on its website yesterday that
price caps will be used on “important daily necessities” and
production materials if necessary, following a meeting chaired
by Premier Wen Jiabao. The cabinet pledged to stabilize natural
gas prices, crack down on speculation in farm products and
ensure the supply of vegetables, grain, cooking oil and sugar.  “Short-position holders chose to lock-in profits, and the
relatively low open interest and trading volumes amplified the
price move,” Ren said. “We need to wait for a few days to see
how the physical markets react.”  Cash Market  Copper traded on Changjiang, Shanghai’s largest nonferrous
metals market, was quoted around 62,050 yuan a ton today, or a
discount of 50 yuan to 150 yuan to Shanghai’s front-month
futures contract.  China sold 16,353 tons of lead ingots offered at a state
auction on Nov. 16, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a statement on its website today. The metal
was sold at an average price of 17,030 yuan a ton, it said.  The  U.S. currency  declined against 13 of its 16 major
counterparts on speculation the Federal Reserve will follow
through on its stimulus plan to buy $600 billion in bonds. The
Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of
currencies, dropped as much as 0.5 percent to 78.699.  “Following the steep losses in the past few days, the
dollar’s retreat since yesterday seems to be at least partially
and temporarily offsetting the tightening worries,” said Li
Peiying, an analyst at Essence Futures Co., by phone.  Aluminum in London rose 1.1 percent to $2,300 a ton, and
lead gained 2.2 percent to $2,314 a ton. Nickel increased 1.6
percent to $21,889 a ton, and tin advanced 2.6 percent to
$25,400 a ton at 3:10 p.m. in Shanghai.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Ravil Shirodkar.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
