Johnny Rotten, whose 1970s punk band
the Sex Pistols savaged Britain’s royal establishment with their
version of “God Save the Queen,” congratulated Prince William 
and  Kate Middleton on their engagement in an article he wrote
for the Sun.  The singer, who now uses his given name of John Lydon ,
wrote in the newspaper that when he heard the news “I had a
nice cup of tea for them. Later on, I might even put some buck’s
fizz in my veins in their honor.”  Lydon said he’s never hated the Royal Family, just the
institution, describing the engagement as a “beautiful love
story.”  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
