Gold may advance 9.6 percent to a
record $1,485 an ounce by the end of the year, according to
technical analysts at Barclays Capital.  “Strategically, we are bullish,” the bank said. “Medium-
term trend followers are unlikely to have been panicked out of
their positions given that important support between $1,314 and
$1,331 is still holding,” according to a report dated yesterday
by analysts including  Philip Roberts .  Gold for immediate delivery gained 1.4 percent to $1,354.95
an ounce today after losing 5.2 percent in the previous four
days. The metal climbed to a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9. Hedge-
fund managers and other large speculators increased their  net-
long  positions in New York gold futures by 7 percent in the week
ended Nov. 9, ending four weeks of declines, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  “A bearish divergence signal on weekly charts, though,
warns of downside risk throughout the month, and we still fear
an important clearout below $1,314 to $1,250 before gold
recovers,” the bank said. “We would be bargain-hunting as the
price approaches $1,250.”  Resistance levels are at $1,387, $1,377 and $1,364 an ounce
and support is at $1,314, $1,297 and $1,250, it said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts

commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
