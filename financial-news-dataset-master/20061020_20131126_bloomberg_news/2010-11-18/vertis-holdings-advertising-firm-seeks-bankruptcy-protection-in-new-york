Vertis Holdings Inc. , a provider of
advertising services, filed for bankruptcy in New York under a
plan to reorganize with the support of its debt holders.  The Baltimore-based company cited liabilities exceeding $1
billion and more than $1 billion of assets in a Chapter 11
filing dated Nov. 17 in New York Bankruptcy Court.  This marks the second time in more than two years that
Vertis has sought bankruptcy protection. The company filed for
bankruptcy in July 2008 to ease a merger with American Color
Graphics Inc, and exited bankruptcy a month later.  Vertis said July 23 this year that it was seeking $575
million in loans to refinance debt.  Lenders agreed to provide Vertis with $175 million in
debtor-in-possession financing upon the bankruptcy filing,
according to the latest court documents.  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP  were hired as
legal advisers in the bankruptcy and Perella Weinberg Partners
LP were employed as investment banker and financial advisor,
according to the documents.  The case is Re: Vertis Holdings Inc. U.S. Bankruptcy Court
