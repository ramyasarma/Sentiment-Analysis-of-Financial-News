Geo-Alliance Oil-Gas Public Ltd.,
the energy producer controlled by Ukrainian billionaire  Victor Pinchuk , plans to sell about 750 million zloty ($258 million) of
shares in an initial public offering in Poland to finance
expansion.  Bookbuilding for a 34 percent stake starts today and is due
to end on Nov. 30, the Kiev-based company said in a prospectus
published on the Warsaw bourse’s  website . The company plans to
begin trading on the Warsaw Stock Exchange around Dec. 9.  Ukrainian food and farming producers  Agroton Public Ltd. ,
Kernel Holding SA and Astarta Holding NV already trade on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange. The bourse is the third-largest in
emerging Europe after Russia and Turkey with a total market
capitalization of $188 billion.  Milkiland NV, a dairy company that operates in Russia and
Ukraine, this week started book-building for a Polish IPO.  Poland had the highest number of IPOs each year in central
Europe since at least 2004, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sixty-two IPOs have raised a record $4.85 billion in
2010, the largest coming from state-run insurer PZU SA and power
utility Tauron Polska Energia SA.  UniCredit Bank AG is the global coordinator of Geo-
Alliance’s IPO and Concorde Capital is a joint lead manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
