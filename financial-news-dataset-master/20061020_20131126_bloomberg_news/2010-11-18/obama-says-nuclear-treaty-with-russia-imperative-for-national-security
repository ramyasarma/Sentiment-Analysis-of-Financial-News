President Barack Obama said Congress
has “no higher priority” than ratifying a stalled nuclear arms
treaty with Russia before the end of the year.  Senate action on the accord “is a national security
priority,” Obama said today at a White House after meeting with
current and former top defense and foreign policy officials on
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. He called the agreement a
“cornerstone” of the U.S. relationship with Russia  Obama has enlisted former advisers from Democratic and
Republican administrations in his bid to keep up pressure on the
Senate to ratify the treaty. Among them at today’s session were
James Baker, President George H.W. Bush’s secretary of state;
Henry Kissinger, secretary of state under Presidents Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Madeleine Albright, President Bill
Clinton’s secretary of state.  Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the
accord in April. The president’s push for a vote suffered a
setback this week when Arizona Senator Jon Kyl, the chamber’s
second-ranking Republican and one of his party’s leading voices
on nuclear-weapons policy, said the issues are too complex to
resolve by year’s end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
