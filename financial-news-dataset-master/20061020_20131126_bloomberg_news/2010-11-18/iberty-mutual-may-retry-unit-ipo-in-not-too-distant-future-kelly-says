Liberty Mutual Holding Co., the
insurer that postponed an initial public offering of almost $1.3
billion for a unit, may attempt to complete the share sale “in
the not too distant future,” the chief executive officer said.  “We just didn’t like the pricing,” CEO  Edmund “Ted” Kelly  said at an interview today in New York. “We didn’t need
the capital.”  Liberty Mutual Agency Corp. , which sells policies through
agents for the Boston-based insurer, was seeking in September to
sell 64.3 million Class A shares at $18 to $20 each, then
delayed the offer, citing an “unfavorable environment.” At
least 59 companies have postponed or withdrawn U.S. initial
share sales this year.  “There’s going to be opportunities out there,” Kelly said
today after speaking at a National Underwriter conference. “I
hope in the not too distant future we will go back at it again.”  The parent company, which is policyholder-owned, covers
cars and homes and provides workers’ compensation policies to
businesses. The insurer operates in more than 20 nations
including Brazil, China and Chile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
