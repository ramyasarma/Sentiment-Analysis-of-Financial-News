What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 30 cents to 33 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand rebounds following the
biggest two-day slump in 16 months, said  Jeff Thompson , a grain
broker at ABN Amro Clearing LLC in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures
may open $6 to $8 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 1.2 cents to 1.5 cents a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 16 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as China increases purchases of livestock feed from
the U.S., Thompson said. Demand from makers of feed, ethanol and
food may climb after prices fell to a five-week low yesterday,
he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that worldwide demand will exceed
production in 2011, Thompson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
