Centrica Plc said a gas leak at the
Easington terminal in northeast England halted flows today from
Rough, the U.K.’s biggest natural-gas storage site.  “We currently expect to resume production operations
during gas day 19th November 2010,” Centrica Storage Ltd. said
on its website.  The leak has been contained and customers won’t be
affected, it said. The halt began at about 1:45 p.m. London
time, according to National Grid Plc data.  Gas for delivery in December rose as much as 1.5 percent,
or 0.75 pence, to 49.35 pence a therm, according to broker
prices on Bloomberg. That’s equal to $7.90 a million British
thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
