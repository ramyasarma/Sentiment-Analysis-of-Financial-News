Exxon Mobil Corp.  and its partners
in a $15 billion liquefied natural gas development in Papua New
Guinea are likely to produce more fuel than they initially
expected during the first phase of the project, analysts said.  The venture initially may produce 6.9 million metric tons
of LNG from two units, up from the 6.6 million tons previously
projected, according to Credit Suisse and Citigroup Inc.
analysts who cover Exxon’s partner,  Oil Search Ltd.   The Hides field drilling campaign next year is likely to
underpin an expansion of the project to a third processing unit,
Sydney-based Credit Suisse analyst  Sandra McCullagh  said after a
visit to the project in Papua New Guinea. A final investment
decision on the next stage may occur in 2012, she said.  Exxon and partners approved the development of the project
almost a year ago. The venture may double the size of Papua New
Guinea’s economy, Port Moresby-based  Oil Search  has said.  First exports are due in 2014. A third plant may begin in
2016, McCullagh said in the report today.  “We are increasingly confident” Oil Search has additional
growth opportunities that may boost earnings, she said.  Oil Search rose 2.3 percent to A$6.67 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney, compared with a 0.3 percent increase for the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  An additional unit, or train, producing 3.5 million tons of
LNG annually, may cost about $5 billion, Citigroup’s  Mark Greenwood  in Sydney wrote in his report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
