Sugar surged the most in six weeks
on signs that supplies in India, the world’s second-largest
producer, may be lower than estimated as rain, pests and disease
reduce yields.  India probably will produce 23.27 million metric tons in
the year that began Oct. 1, 8.7 percent less than predicted by
industry groups, according to data from farmers interviewed by
SGS SA for Bloomberg. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. said Brazil, the largest grower, may stop exports by
January.  “India and Brazil continue to be the major supporting
factors,” said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at
Newedge USA in New York. “There is concern for next year’s
Brazil crop.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.68 cents, or 6.3
percent, to settle at 28.15 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since Oct. 7. The commodity earlier soared as much as
9.2 percent. In the past year, the sweetener gained 21 percent.  The Indian Sugar Mills Association and the Maharashtra
State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd. forecast
annual production of 25.5 million tons. A smaller crop may
hinder government plans to lift export restrictions, reducing
global supplies at a time of sustained demand.  The dollar dropped against a basket of major currencies,
enhancing the allure of commodities as an alternative
investment. The euro rebounded against the greenback on optimism
that a bailout for Ireland will ease the region’s debt concerns.  “The macro winds have changed,” McDougall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
