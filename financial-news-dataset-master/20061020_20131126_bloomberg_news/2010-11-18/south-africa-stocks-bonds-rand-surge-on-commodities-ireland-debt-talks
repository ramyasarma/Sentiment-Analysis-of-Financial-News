South African stocks  climbed the
most in two weeks, bonds rose for the first day in five and the
rand gained for a second day after prices of commodities surged
as prospects of a bailout for Ireland curbed risk aversion.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  added as much as 1.1
percent, the most since Nov. 4, to 31,693.46 and traded at
31,660.03 by 11:28 a.m. in Johannesburg. Gains were led by BHP
Billiton Plc, the world’s biggest mining company and Anglo
American Plc. The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September
2015 climbed 15 cents to 125.65 rand, reducing the yield by 3
basis points to 7.11 percent. The rand traded 0.5 percent
stronger at 6.9782 versus the dollar.  The Irish government will hold talks with the European
Union, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank
about a possible bailout, easing investor concerns about the
nation’s fiscal prospects. Copper surged the most in more than a
week, gaining as much as 2.6 percent to $8,399 a metric ton on
the London Metals Exchange.  The South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee
will announce its decision on the  benchmark interest rate  after
3 p.m. today. Analysts expect a 50 basis-point reduction in the
rate to 5.5 percent, according to the median forecast of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Five economists predict the
rate will be unchanged.  “If the MPC keeps rates on hold today as we suspect they
will, then the rand could receive another boost,”  John Cairns 
and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency analysts at Johannesburg-based
Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated
today. “With Ireland finally accepting that it may need help,
it looks like a bailout could come as soon as next week. The
rand can handle a market run on Greece, Portugal or Ireland but
not on the much larger economies of Spain or Italy.”  Inflation, Stocks  The rand has gained 35 percent against the dollar since the
start of 2009, cutting the cost of imports and helping to push
the inflation rate to 3.2 percent, the lowest in more than five
years. The currency’s advance has also damped manufacturing,
which grew an annual 1.4 percent in September, the slowest pace
in 11 months, fueling calls by labor unions for the central bank
to do more to spur growth and create jobs.  “The room has been provided for another rate cut today,”
 Jeff Gable , head of research at Absa Capital, said in a
presentation in Cape Town. “The strong exchange rate allows the
Reserve Bank to stoke the economy a little bit more.”  Anglo American , which comprises more than 10 percent of the
All-Share index, snapped two days of declines, rising 1.9
percent to 328.20.  Billiton  added 1.3 percent to 262.50 rand.  SABMiller Plc, the maker of Grolsch and Peroni beers,
rallied to the highest since at least January 1995, climbing 3.6
percent to 239.25 rand after reporting a 19 percent increase in
first-half profit to $1.47 billion, exceeding analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
