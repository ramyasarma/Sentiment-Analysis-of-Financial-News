Eureko BV sold a stake in  PZU SA ,
Poland’s largest insurer, to financial investors for 4.1 billion
zloty ($1.4 billion) as part of an earlier agreement with the
Polish government over control of the company.  The Dutch financial-services group sold 11.22 million
shares, or 12.9 percent, at 365 zloty each, Eureko said in an e-
mailed statement distributed by Warsaw-based ComPress SA. The
share sale, which started yesterday, was oversubscribed, two
people close to the offer told Bloomberg News earlier today.  PZU  shares were little changed, adding less than 0.1
percent to 369.3 zloty at 1:50 p.m. in Warsaw, following
yesterday’s 3 percent gain. The stock trades 18 percent higher
than the price at its April  initial public offering , when the
Polish government and Eureko sold their combined 30 percent.  Poland must hold its remaining 45 percent stake for a
period of 180 days after the transaction, according to Eureko’s
statement. Earlier, Poland and Eureko had agreed the Treasury
couldn’t sell its stake before January 2012.  Eureko and the government last year ended an eight-year
struggle for control over PZU. The company began trading on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange in May and overtook Vienna Insurance Group
AG as central Europe’s largest publicly traded insurer by market
value.  Deutsche Bank AG and PKO Bank Polski SA managed the share
sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
