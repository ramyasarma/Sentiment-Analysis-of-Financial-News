Daewoo Motor Sales Corp.  slumped for
a second day in Seoul trading to the lowest level in nine years
after reporting yesterday that liabilities outstripped assets.  The stock fell by the daily limit of 15 percent to 1,870
won, the  lowest level  since May 2001, on the Korea Exchange at
2:44 p.m. The benchmark Kospi index rose 1.2 percent.  Liabilities swelled to 2.43 trillion won ($2.1 billion) as
of Sept. 30, about 4.5 billion won more than assets, according
to a regulatory filing yesterday. Officials at Daewoo Motor
Sales, an auto trader and property developer based in Incheon
west of Seoul, declined to comment.  “The report that the company’s capital eroded caused the
stock to keep plunging,” said  Lee Sang Hyun , an auto analyst at
NH Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “It’s not clear where
this company is heading. It severed ties with GM Daewoo and its
real estate business is not in a good shape either.”  Daewoo Motor Sales issued a regulatory filing in September
saying it entered an out-of-court debt restructuring program
with creditors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
