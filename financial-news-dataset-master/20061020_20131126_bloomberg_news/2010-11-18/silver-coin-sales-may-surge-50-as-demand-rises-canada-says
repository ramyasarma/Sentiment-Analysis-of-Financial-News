Canada’s sales of silver coins will
jump more than 50 percent this year and will continue to climb
in 2011, said David Madge, the director of sales at the Royal
Canadian Mint.  “Sales of silver coins for 2010 are very strong and we
expect them to be at least 50 percent higher,” Madge said in an
e-mail, declining to give a forecast for this year’s sales. The
Ottawa-based mint sold 10.3 million ounces of coins in 2009, he
said.  Silver futures have jumped 59 percent in New York this year
as demand rose for precious metals as an alternative to
currencies. Investors have bought coins “because they are
cheap,” and are helping to support the price of the metal,
 Francisco Blanch , the head of commodity research at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, said today at a conference in New York.  In October, the mint boosted its premium on coins to $2 per
ounce, from $1.50 because of increased production costs, Madge
said.  “We have not seen a decline in demand,” after the
premiums increased for Silver Maple Leaf coins, Madge said.  Silver futures for December delivery rose $1.323, or 5.2
percent, to $26.834 an ounce on the Comex in New York today.
Last week, the metal reached a 30-year high of $29.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
