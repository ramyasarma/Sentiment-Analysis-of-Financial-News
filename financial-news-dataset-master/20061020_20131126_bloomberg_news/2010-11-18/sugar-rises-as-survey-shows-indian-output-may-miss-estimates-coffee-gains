Sugar rose for a second day in New
York and London on concern about global supply after a survey
showed output may be lower than estimated in India, the world’s
second-biggest producer.  Indian sugar production may be 8.7 percent less than
predicted because of lower yields in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest
cane-growing state, according to 810 farmers interviewed by SGS
SA for Bloomberg. Prices also gained as Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said Brazil’s Center South region may
run out of its exportable surplus by January.  “Fundamentally speaking, it’s a very tight market, which
is supportive,” said Fabienne Pointier, an analyst and broker
at Lausanne, Switzerland-based research company Kingsman SA.
“We are approaching the inter-crop season in Brazil, which
means we will have lower sugar availability, and it should be a
bit quieter in terms of output and export flow.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 1.95 cents, or 7.4
percent, to 28.42 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 8:39 a.m.
in New York. That was the biggest intraday rise for the
sweetener since Oct. 7. Prices closed at a 29-year high on Nov.
9 and slid 21 percent in the following three days.  Indian sugar output may be 23.27 million tons in 2010-2011,
according to the survey. The Indian Sugar Mills Association and
the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation
Ltd. forecast 25.5 million tons. A smaller crop may hinder
government plans to lift export restrictions, reducing global
supply at a time of sustained import demand.  Exports From India  “We’ve also had no confirmation on Indian exports yet,”
Pointier said.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery rose $42.40, or
6.3 percent, to $712.90 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.
Prices reached $811 on Nov. 11, the highest level since at least
1989.  Brazil will only begin harvesting its 2011-12 crop in
April, ANZ Bank said.  “The volume of cane crushed in Brazil’s Central South fell
12 percent year-on-year in October,” Melbourne-based ANZ Bank
economist  Paul Deane  wrote in a report dated today, referring to
the country’s most productive region. Brazil’s biggest producing
region “will likely have run down its exportable sugar surplus
to zero by January, so supply for the first half of 2011 will
remain tight.”  Arabica coffee for March delivery added 2.8 percent to
$2.086 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for January delivery
rose 1.7 percent to $1,889 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for March delivery gained 2.8 percent to $2,917 a ton
in New York, heading for the biggest gain in four months. The
chocolate ingredient for March delivery also rose in London,
climbing 1.9 percent to 1,917 pounds ($3,068) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
