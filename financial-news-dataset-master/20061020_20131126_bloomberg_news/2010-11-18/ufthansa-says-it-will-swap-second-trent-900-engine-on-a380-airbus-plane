Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-biggest airline, will replace a second Rolls-Royce Group
Plc engine on one of its Airbus SAS A380 planes after
identifying a component that may be linked to a turbine
explosion on a Qantas Airways Ltd. plane this month.  Lufthansa concluded after discussions with Rolls-Royce that
a Trent 900 engine on its first super-jumbo plane, delivered in
May, contained an unspecified part of an older generation,
spokesman  Thomas Jachnow  said in a telephone interview today.
Rolls-Royce may send a new power plant as a replacement as
Lufthansa has no suitable spare engines, he said.  The German carrier will today put a new A380 superjumbo it
received this week into passenger service, the first since
Qantas grounded its entire A380 fleet after an engine blowout
resulted in an emergency landing on Nov. 4. Rolls-Royce may swap
40 Trent 900 engines, about half of all units in service, and
replace them with turbines from jet assembly lines, Qantas Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  said today.  “I have no doubt whatsoever that Rolls Royce will deal with
this issue, and that the problem will be completely resolved
within a few weeks or months,” Air France-KLM Group CEO  Pierre- Henri Gourgeon  said last night.  Air France, Europe’s biggest airline, has four A380s that
are powered by engines from the Engine Alliance of General
Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney.  Lufthansa will continue to perform checks at least every
ten flight cycles as required by the European Aviation Safety
Agency, Jachnow said.  ‘Younger Generation’  The Cologne, Germany-based carrier, which will fly its
fourth A380 today to Tokyo from Frankfurt, is the only European
airline to have A380s with Trent 900 engines that are in
operation. The carrier replaced one turbine last week as a
“precautionary measure.”  The remaining 15 engines contain the module recommended by
Rolls-Royce as they belong to a younger generation, Jachnow said
today. Flight schedules are unchanged, he said.  Lufthansa  rose  24.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 16.22 euros
at 11:57 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 38 percent this
year, valuing the carrier at 7.4 billion euros ($10.1 billion).
Rolls-Royce, based in Derby, England, added 0.2 percent to 600.5
pence in London.  Lufthansa, which is scheduled to receive four more A380s in
the first half on 2011, said yesterday that there was no
indication from Airbus that future deliveries might be affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
