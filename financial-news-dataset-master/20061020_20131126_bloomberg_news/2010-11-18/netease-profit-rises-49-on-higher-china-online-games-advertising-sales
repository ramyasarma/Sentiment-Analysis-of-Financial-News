NetEase.com Inc. , China’s third-
biggest online games operator, said third-quarter profit rose 49
percent, more than analysts estimated, after the company boosted 
sales by upgrading some of its titles.  Net income  increased to 585.3 million yuan ($88 million),
or 4.48 yuan per American depositary receipt, from 393.8 million
yuan, or 3.02 yuan, a year earlier, NetEase said in a statement.
Profit was expected to be 531.4 million yuan, the average of
eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 59
percent to 1.4 billion yuan from 879.4 million yuan.  NetEase’s stock has outperformed those of bigger rivals
 Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and  Shanda Games Ltd.  this year as the
Beijing-based company unveiled expansion packs for games
including “World of Warcraft” and “Fantasy Westward
Journey.” Online advertising sales also rose as NetEase drew
more users to its web portal, the fifth-most popular in China.  Revenue  from online games rose 62 percent to 1.26 billion
yuan in the quarter, NetEase said. Sales of online advertising
rose 88 percent to 162 million yuan.  NetEase  ADRs  rose 3.3 percent to $40.92 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading yesterday. The shares have gained 8.8 percent
this year, compared with the 1.1 percent decline in the Hong
Kong-traded shares of Tencent, China’s biggest Internet company
by market value.  In August, NetEase started offering “Wrath of the Lich
King,” an upgrade to “World of Warcraft,” the multiplayer
role-playing game developed by  Activision Blizzard Inc.   Online game sales in China, the world’s biggest Internet
market by users, rose 30 percent to 27 billion yuan last year,
according to iResearch, a Shanghai-based research company.  NetEase’s Web portal trails sites run by  Baidu Inc. ,
operator of China’s biggest search-engine, and  Tencent ,  Sina 
Corp. and  Sohu .com Inc. in user traffic in China, according to
 China Websites Ranking , a site run by the Internet Society of
China that compiles Web traffic information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
