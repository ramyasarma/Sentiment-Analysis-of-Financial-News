Steven Rattner, the former head of
Quadrangle Group, will pay $6.2 million and accept a two-year
ban from associating with broker-dealers or investment advisers
to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims
stemming from alleged kickbacks in connection with the New York
state pension fund.  The sanctions, including a payment of $3.2 million in
disgorgement and a $3 million fine, were confirmed by David
Rosenfeld, an SEC attorney working on the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
