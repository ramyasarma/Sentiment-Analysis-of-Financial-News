Hewlett-Packard Co.  said it will
offer a new desktop personal-computer in India, after the global
industry leader lost market share to rival  Dell Inc.  in Asia’s
third-biggest economy.  The company will start selling the HP DreamScreen desktop
at about 19,999 rupees ($442) each in 700 outlets in 60 cities
later this month, according to a statement issued in New Delhi
today. The product is intended to facilitate Internet access for
family users, it said.  Hewlett-Packard’s share of the Indian PC market  fell to 
13.7 percent last quarter, making the Palo Alto, California-
based company the second-placed vendor locally, according to
research company IDC. Dell is the leading supplier after
increasing market share to 16.7 percent, IDC said.  The DreamScreen desktop has an 18.5-inch touchscreen
display, and can support video calls, Hewlett-Packard said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
