Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose past 10,000 for the first time since June, led by financial
companies on speculation an improving economy will boost
earnings, and as the euro advanced against the yen.  MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. gained 4 percent after
the Nikkei newspaper said the insurer will sell about 300
billion yen ($3.6 billion) in shareholdings.  Resona Holdings
Inc. , Japan’s fourth-largest bank, jumped 9.2 percent. Sony
Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions which gets 23 percent of
its sales from Europe, rose 2.2 percent to 2,945 yen.  Showa
Denko K.K. , a maker of electronic materials, climbed 6.3 percent
after UBS AG increased its investment rating to “buy.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 2.1 percent to 10,013.63 in Tokyo, the
highest close since June 22. The broader  Topix  index increased
2.2 percent to 868.81, the most among Asian equity indexes. More
than 21 times as many stocks advanced as declined. All of the 33
industry groups in the Topix gained.  “The economic situation is good globally and that’s
supporting the financial market,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “People no longer worry that the
U.S. economy will slow down, and concerns about the yen’s
appreciation have eased.”  Insurance companies gained ahead of earnings reports.  MS&AD 
rose 4 percent to 2,113 yen. The insurer plans to sell
shareholdings between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013, the Nikkei
newspaper reported, without saying how it got the information.  Japan Lags Behind  T&D Holdings Inc. is scheduled to announce its first-half
earnings result today and MS&AD,  Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.  and
NKSJ Holdings Inc. will report earnings tomorrow. The companies’
shares advanced at least 4 percent.  The  Topix  has declined 4.3 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 5.7 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the
U.S. and 5.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Japanese benchmark are valued at 15.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500
and 12 times for the Stoxx 600. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has
gained 9.3 percent this year.  “Investors will shift to Japanese stocks, which have
lagged behind other markets, particularly from those in other
Asian countries that have advanced too far,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Banks, Brokers  Banks and  securities companies  also advanced. In 2010,
banks have declined 9.3 percent and brokerages have lost 25
percent, compared with a 4.3 percent drop in the Topix index.
Brokerages have had the second-largest decline and banks had the
sixth-biggest drop among the 33 industry groups this year.  Resona  soared 9.2 percent to 500 yen, the most in the
Nikkei. Shinsei Bank Ltd. surged 7.1 percent to 75 yen. Mizuho
Securities Co. leapt 7 percent to 199 yen.  The average book value to share price of insurers,
brokerages and banks has been below 1 since at least July,
according to Bloomberg data. The average price of stocks in the
Topix is 1.03 times book value.  Sony rose 2.2 percent to 2,945 yen. Canon Inc., a camera
maker which gets 30 percent of its  revenue from Europe ,
increased 1.3 percent to 4,015 yen. Olympus Corp., an optical-
instrument maker that derives more than 20 percent of its sales
from Europe, climbed 2.9 percent to 2,313 yen.  Citizen Holdings
Co. , a watchmaker that earns more 10 percent of its sales in
Europe, gained 1.2 percent to 520 yen.  Euro Climbs  The euro advanced to 113.24 yen as of 12:50 p.m. in Tokyo
from 112.66 at yesterday’s close of stock trading. The Irish
government will hold talks with the European Union,
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank “over
a number of days,” a Finance Ministry spokesman said yesterday,
easing concern Ireland’s debt crisis will spread.  The number of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s
first section was 2.44 billion, the  highest  since Oct. 6.  “Funds are coming into Japanese stocks,” as the yen’s
appreciation has stopped, said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist
at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the
equivalent of $37 billion. Japanese stocks have been
“underweight” among global fund managers because of concerns
about the strong yen, he said.  The Japanese currency weakened to as low as 83.40 yen
against the dollar, near the weakest level since Oct. 4. That’s
weaker than the rate that major Japanese companies expect for
the second-half period of the year ending March 31.  Currency Trend  Japanese carmakers such as Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor
Co. and electronics makers including Canon and Hitachi Ltd.
forecast the Japanese currency will trade at 80 yen against the
dollar.  “If the trend of the currency becomes clearer, investors’
sentiment should improve further,” Ichiyoshi’s Akino said.  Showa Denko leapt 6.3 percent to 168 yen after UBS AG
increased its  investment recommendation  to “buy” from
“neutral.” Nitto Denko Corp., a maker of chemical products,
gained 4 percent to 3,630 yen after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
raised its rating to “buy” from “neutral,” citing expected
demand for tablet computers.  DIC Corp., a printing-ink producer, soared 7.1 percent to
166 yen after its rating was improved to “buy” from “hold”
at Deutsche Bank AG because of its earnings outlook and
valuations.  “Foreign hedge funds are buying back Japanese stocks ahead
of the fiscal year end,” said  Tsutomu Yamada , a market analyst
at kabu.com Securities Co. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter for this story:
