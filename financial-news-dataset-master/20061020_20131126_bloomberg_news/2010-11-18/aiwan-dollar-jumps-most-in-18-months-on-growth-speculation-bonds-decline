Taiwan’s dollar rose before a
government report today showed the economy expanded more than
economists estimated in the third quarter.  The currency trimmed most of today’s gain on suspected
intervention by the central bank, according to two traders
familiar with the operation of the central bank who declined to
be identified. Government data released after trading ended
showed the  economy  grew 9.8 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
17 economists was for an increase of 8.3 percent.  “The currency’s rise is supported by strong fundamentals
as Taiwan’s economy keeps expanding,” said  Eric Hsing , a fixed-
income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “The central
bank will continue its effort in weakening its currency.”  The Taiwan dollar closed 0.2 percent stronger at NT$30.733
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
was 1.4 percent higher at NT$30.375 one minute before the 4 p.m.
close. The currency reached NT$30.015 on Nov. 12, the highest
level since March 2008.  The island’s central bank has been buying the U.S. dollar
almost every day in the past six months, according to traders
who declined to be identified as the monetary authority doesn’t
usually publicly disclose details of market actions.  Government bonds fell the most in nearly five weeks,
pushing the yield on benchmark 10-year notes to the highest
level in more than three months. The yield on the 1.125 percent
note due September 2020 rose three basis points to 1.37 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s biggest
exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporter on the story:
