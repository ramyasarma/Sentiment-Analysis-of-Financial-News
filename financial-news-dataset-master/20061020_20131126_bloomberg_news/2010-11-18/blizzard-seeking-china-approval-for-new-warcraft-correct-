Activision Blizzard Inc. , the
world’s biggest video-game publisher, said it plans to add
developers to its “ Diablo 3 ” team as it considers making a
version of the online title for consoles.  “We’re exploring the idea of what it would take to make a
possible conversion,” Jay Wilson, Diablo 3’s game director,
said today in Busan, South Korea. Activision Blizzard plans to
hire three more console-game developers, said  Bob Colayco , a
spokesman for the Santa Monica, California-based company.  “ Diablo 3 ,” a multiplayer online battle involving wizards
and demon hunters, has been developed only for personal
computers. The company, controlled by Paris-based  Vivendi SA ,
hasn’t decided when it will start selling the latest installment
in the series, Wilson said.  Activision also is seeking approval from the Chinese
government to start offering its latest expansion set, or
supplement, to the “World of Warcraft” game, Colayco said. The
title, the world’s most popular computer game, is operated by
NetEase.com Inc. in China.  “The process has started through our partner NetEase,”
Colayco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
