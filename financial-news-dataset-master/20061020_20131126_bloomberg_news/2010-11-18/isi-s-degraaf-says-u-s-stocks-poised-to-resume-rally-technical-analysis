This week’s retreat in U.S. stocks
is probably temporary and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
unlikely to fall more than 8 percent from its 2010 high, said
Jeffrey deGraaf of ISI Group Inc.  The S&P 500 has lost 3.9 percent since closing at a two-
year high of 1,225.85 on Nov. 5, including a 1.6 percent retreat
on Nov. 16 that was the  biggest  in three months. The main
benchmark for American equities is 5.7 percent higher for the
year, and up 15 percent from its 2010 low on July 2. It rose 1.2
percent to 1,192.45 as of 9:34 a.m. today in New York.  DeGraaf, the head of technical analysis at ISI, said in an
interview that the market’s trend turned to positive last month
after gauges of momentum on Sept. 3 registered their best
readings since March 2009. The historical tendency of stocks to
rise between now and the end of January, and  leadership  from
commodity, consumer discretionary and industrial companies
during the retreat, support a bullish outlook, he said.  “You want those to be the leadership groups to be bullish
on stocks,” deGraaf said. “It’s a very dangerous time to be
fighting a strong tape seasonally. So we’ll get a consolidation
-- I don’t think it’s anything worse than 1,130 -- and then take
another run at a new high.”  Urban Outfitters Inc., the Philadelphia-based apparel
retailer, has gained 15 percent since Nov. 5, one of fifty
companies in the S&P 500 to rise during the period, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Fortune Brands Inc., the maker of
Jim Beam bourbon, has climbed 7.4 percent.  July Rally  Stocks’ advance since July was spurred by anticipation of
Republican gains in congressional elections on Nov. 2, the
Federal Reserve’s Nov. 3 announcement that it will buy $600
billion of Treasury securities through June to stimulate the
economy, and a Nov. 5 Labor Department report showing payrolls
grew twice as much as economists estimated in October.  “We’re burning off the optimism that surrounded
quantitative easing, the election and the payrolls data,”
deGraaf said. “It was too much for the market to bear at that
point in time.” While a 1.9 percent rally by the S&P 500 on
Nov. 4 gave “a very good, robust momentum signal,” it was
accompanied by more than 80 percent of S&P 500 stocks trading
above their 200-day moving average, indicating the market was
“overbought,” deGraaf said.  Technical market analysts base predictions on price and
volume chart patterns. DeGraaf, who is based in New York, has
been the top-ranked technical analyst in Institutional Investor
magazine’s poll for six straight years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
