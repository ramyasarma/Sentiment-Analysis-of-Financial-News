New York City’s unemployment rate
dropped to a seasonally adjusted 9.2 percent in October, the
lowest since April 2009, the state  Labor Department  said.  The city jobless level was down from 9.3 percent in
September and 10.4 percent in October 2009, the department in
Albany said in a report today. The state rate remained at 8.3
percent.  Private employment in the city, the nation’s most-populous,
increased by 41,900, more than twice the 10-year average monthly
gain of 18,700. Jobs in professional and business services, such
as legal, accounting and advertising, increased by 14,600
positions.  “An important aspect of these jobs is that they tend to be
well paying,” Kevin Jack, an economist at the department, said
in an interview.  The business services category “has led the economic
recovery in New York City this year, as a strong rebound in
corporate profits encouraged higher spending on many of the
services these firms provide,” James Brown, a Labor Department
economist, said in a statement.  The number of financial-industry workers in the city
increased by 2,200 to 433,500, up 5,000 from a year ago,
according to the report.  Wall Street  The city and state unemployment rates remain below the U.S.
rate of 9.6 percent. While the state didn’t lose as many jobs as
other parts of the country, “we lost income” from the reduced
capital gains and bonus payments of Wall Street workers, New
York Budget Director  Robert Megna  said in a speech today at the
Albany-based  Rockefeller Institute for Government .  New York state’s economy added 40,500 private sector jobs
in October, excluding the self-employed and agricultural
workers, according to the  report . It was the largest monthly
increase since April 2005.  Over the past year, the largest job gains in the state were
in professional and business services, with an increase of
31,700 positions; and educational and health services with
25,300. The largest declines were among state and local
governments, which lost 37,700 jobs.  Pennsylvania, New Jersey  The unemployment rate also fell last month in Pennsylvania,
the sixth-most populous U.S. state, and New Jersey, the 11th-
biggest. New York is the third- largest .  Pennsylvania’s rate slid 0.2 percentage point to 8.8
percent as the state added 15,900 jobs. It was the third
straight month the rate declined, and the first time it was
below 9 percent since February, according to Pennsylvania’s
labor department. The rate is down from 9 percent in September,
and up from 8.6 percent in October 2009.  New Jersey’s unemployment rate also fell by 0.2 percentage
point last month, to 9.2 percent from 9.4 percent in September.
