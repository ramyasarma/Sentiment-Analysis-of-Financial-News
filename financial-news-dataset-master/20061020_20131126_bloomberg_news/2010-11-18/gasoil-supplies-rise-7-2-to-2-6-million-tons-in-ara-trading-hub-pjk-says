Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in northwest Europe rose for a fourth week as demand
slowed. Jet fuel supplies also increased.  Gasoil inventories climbed 7.2 percent to 2.56 million
metric tons in the week to today, said PJK International BV, an
industry consultant. That’s the highest level since the week
ended Sept. 9.  The European gasoil futures contango widened in the past
week, signaling weakening demand. The contango price structure,
where contracts for later delivery are more expensive than those
close to expiry, can encourage buyers to put fuel into storage
and sell it later at a higher price.  “The market is slow,”  Pieter Kulsen , founder of PJK, said
from Oosterhout in the Netherlands, where the company is based.
Buyers can “store the product without price risk because of the
contango,” he said.  Gasoil for December delivery traded at a discount of as
much as $4.75 to the January contract on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange today, compared with $3.25 a week ago.  Jet fuel  inventories rose the most in five months, adding
122,000 tons to 771,000 tons, as at least one shipment arrived
from India. “There are cargoes expected from the Far East this
month,” Kulsen said.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
