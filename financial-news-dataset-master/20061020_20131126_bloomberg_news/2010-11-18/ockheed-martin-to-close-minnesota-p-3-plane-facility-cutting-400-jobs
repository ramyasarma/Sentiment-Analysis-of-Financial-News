Lockheed Martin Corp . will close its
plant that makes components for the P-3 surveillance plane in
Eagan, Minnesota, by 2013 and move work from its Middle River,
Maryland, site next year, resulting in at least 400 job cuts.  Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Sensors unit will shift 650
jobs from Eagan to Owego, New York, San Diego and Manassas,
Virginia, according to a statement today. The company will also
transfer work on ground vehicles from Owego to Dallas.  “The net result would be about 400 jobs eliminated,”  Anne Marie Squeo , a spokeswoman for Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed, said in a phone interview. The number of job cuts may
be higher if employees whose jobs are being transferred choose
not to go, she said.  Closing the plants will save the company $150 million over
the next 10 years,  Orlando Carvalho , president of Lockheed’s
Mission Systems and Sensors unit, said in the statement. In
September, Lockheed said 25 percent of its executives, or more
than 600 vice presidents and directors, accepted a voluntary
retirement program designed to reduce costs.  The Minnesota plant makes avionics components for P-3
maritime surveillance planes, Squeo said. The Maryland site
makes missile launching systems for U.S. Navy ships, according
to the company’s website. The layoffs will start in the first
quarter of 2011 and continue for two years, according to the
statement.  Lockheed  rose  17 cents to $68.72 at 12:22 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had declined 9
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
