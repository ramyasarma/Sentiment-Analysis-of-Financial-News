The Ontario government is proposing
energy subsidies and tax  credits  after the forecast budget
deficit in Canada’s most populous province narrowed by C$1
billion ($982 million) this year.  The province will run a deficit of C$18.7 billion in the
current fiscal year, down from a June forecast of C$19.7
billion, Finance Minister  Dwight Duncan  said in an update
 released  today in Toronto. Ontario will have budget gaps of
C$17.3 billion in 2011-12 and C$15.9 billion in 2012-13 and a
balanced budget in seven years. Its fiscal year starts April 1.  “They’re pretty much on track with their medium-term fiscal
plan,” Sonya Gulati, an economist for regional and government
finances at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto, said in a phone
interview. “With today’s update, it looks like they can still
return to balance in 2017/18.”  Ontario’s C$578 billion economy will grow 3.2 percent this
year after contracting 3.6 percent in 2009, the government said.
The economy is expected to expand 2.2 percent in 2011, 2.5
percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013.  “Ontario is emerging from the global economic crisis,”
Duncan said in the  text  of a speech to the legislature in
Toronto today. “Economic growth, however, is going to be slower
in the coming years -- mostly due to slow growth in the U.S.
economy.”  Energy Costs  The budget update includes new tax-relief measures. The
Ontario Clean Energy Benefit will give consumers a reduction of
10 percent on their electricity bills starting in January. The
five-year program will cost C$300 million for the current fiscal
year and C$1.1 billion next year.  Under the program, a typical home with a monthly bill of
C$128 will see a yearly reduction of C$153.60 on their
electricity bills, the government said. Even with the subsidy,
energy costs will rise 3.6 percent a year over the next five
years; the increase would be 7.9 percent without the rebates.  A children’s activity tax credit will allow parents to
claim up to C$500 of costs and receive up to C$50 per child per
year toward the costs of activities.  Ontario also said it extended a contract with Teranet,
which provides electronic land registration services, for an
additional 50 years. Teranet’s owner, a unit of  Ontario
Municipal Employees Retirement System , will give the province an
upfront payment of C$1 billion that will be used to reduce debt.
The reduction would decrease Ontario’s borrowing requirements
and save as much as C$50 million in annual interest costs.  Borrowing Needs  Ontario’s long-term public borrowing needs are forecast to
fall to C$38.7 billion in the latest outlook, down C$1 billion
from the March budget. Borrowing requirements will be C$38.8
billion and C$40.2 billion in the next two years.  The government said in August that the outlook for 2010 had
improved since the March budget, reflecting stronger-than-
expected growth in consumer spending and exports. The province
said at the time it would meet its C$19.7 billion deficit target
for the 2010-11 fiscal year. The gap for the 2009-10 year was
C$19.3 billion.  Revenue will rise 12 percent to C$107.7 billion this fiscal
year from C$95.8 billion, while expenses will increase 9 percent
to C$125.6 billion from C$115.1 billion.  Duncan said in March when releasing the 2010 budget that
his province probably wouldn’t balance its books until 2017-18,
and that the deficits would total C$110.2 billion over eight
years.  On Track  “The plan we’ve laid out sees us staying on that track,
but we are exceeding targets up until now,” Duncan told
reporters in Toronto. The U.S. economy, which represents 80
percent of Ontario’s export market, isn’t performing as well as
anticipated, he said.  The global recession last year hit Ontario, the economic
engine that drives 38 percent of Canada’s output, leading to a
surge in unemployment to 9 percent and a slowdown in
manufacturing and sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
