Boeing Co.  is poised to win an order
for more 737 jets from  Copa  Airlines, the Panamanian carrier
that agreed to lease 10 of the planes this week, two people
familiar with the transaction said.  The deal will be announced on Nov. 30, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because details aren’t
public. They wouldn’t say how many of the jetliners Panama City-
based Copa plans to buy. The planes seat as many as 189
passengers and are valued at about $69 million at list prices.  A Copa spokeswoman,  Patricia Roquebert , declined to comment
on any potential purchase, saying only that an announcement was
scheduled for Nov. 30 with Chicago-based Boeing.  Copa, a unit of  Copa Holdings SA , said yesterday it has 33
of Boeing’s single-aisle jets on order, including a new lease
agreement for five 737-800s for delivery in 2011 and five for
2012. Panama’s Tocumen airport is expanding and will increase
capacity by more than 50 percent by the middle of next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
