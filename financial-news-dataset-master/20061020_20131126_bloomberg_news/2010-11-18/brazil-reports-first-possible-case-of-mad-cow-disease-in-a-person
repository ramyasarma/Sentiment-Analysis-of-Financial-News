Brazil , the world’s largest beef
exporter, reported its first suspected case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, which is known to be linked to a cattle illness known
as mad cow.  The city of Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, was notified of
the possible case on Nov. 12, the city’s health department said
on its  website . The city said there’s no transmission of the
disease in Brazil.  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable human illness that
destroys brain tissue, has been linked to eating meat from
animals infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as
BSE or mad cow.  At least 139 people worldwide have died from the human
variant of BSE, according to the World Health Organization’s
website. Most of the deaths were in the U.K.  Brazil’s beef exports totaled $4.12 billion in 2009,
according to the Ministry’s of Agriculture website. The country
has never reported a case of mad cow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
