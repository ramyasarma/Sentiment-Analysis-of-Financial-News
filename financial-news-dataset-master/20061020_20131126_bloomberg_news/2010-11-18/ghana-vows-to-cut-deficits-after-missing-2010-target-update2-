Ghana’s government said it will use
revenue from oil production to slash the budget gap by more than
two-thirds by 2013, after missing the deficit target in its
first two years in office.  The fiscal shortfall will narrow to 7.5 percent of gross
domestic product next year, 4.7 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in
2013, according to a budget statement given to parliament today
by Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor . The deficit was about 9.7
percent of GDP this year, compared with the 7.5 percent target.  The West African country will become Africa’s latest oil
exporter next month when it starts pumping from its Jubilee
field, raising about 584 million cedis ($405 million) in fiscal
revenue. At least 30 percent of that will be saved, according to
a proposed oil law being debated by lawmakers. Oil output will
help lift economic growth to 12.3 percent in 2011, Duffuor said.  “The new budget is sensible and realistic,” said Lisa
Lewin, head of sub-Saharan Africa analysis at Business Monitor
International. “Importantly, the projections of oil revenues
look feasible and there is no expectation that this new revenue
stream will be a silver bullet for the fiscal accounts.”  Government expenditures will rise 15 percent to 12.7
billion cedis next year, as income increases 19 percent to 10.6
billion cedis, Duffuor said.  The deficit forecasts as a percentage of GDP are based on
calculations made before the statistics agency revised up the
size of the economy by 75 percent last week. Given that
revision, the fiscal deficits will be significantly smaller than
those reported today.  Oil Production  The Jubilee field will initially produce about 50,000
barrels of oil a day, increasing to 120,000 barrels a day over
the next three to six months, according to Tullow Oil Plc, the
field’s operator.  Duffuor said the government will increase revenue by
raising taxes on a number of goods and services including
airline flights, plastic packaging, gasoline and cigarettes.  The government will also consider raising cash by
transferring its shares in South African mining giant AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. and royalties from other gold miners to a new
government-owned company that can sell bonds or issue stock,
Duffuor said. Ghana is Africa’s second-largest gold producer.  Much of the new money will be spent on roads, railways and
a salary increase for government workers, according to the
budget.  Ghana, the world’s second-largest producer of cocoa after
Ivory Coast, will also seek to boost output by spending 104.4
million cedis to combat disease and pests on cocoa farms, the
finance minister said. The country produced 630,000 tons of
cocoa in the 2009-2010 season, short of a government target of
700,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
