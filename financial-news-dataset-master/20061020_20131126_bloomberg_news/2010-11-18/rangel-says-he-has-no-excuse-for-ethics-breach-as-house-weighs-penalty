Representative  Charles Rangel ,
seeking “fairness and mercy” over his violations of House rules,
admitted he made numerous mistakes while saying he did “nothing
corrupt” and didn’t sell his office or votes.  Rangel, 80, issued a statement before the House ethics
committee meets today to consider what penalty, if any, it
should impose on the New York Democrat.  “I hope my four decades of service merit a sanction that
is in keeping with and no greater than House precedents and also
contains a drop of fairness and mercy,” said Rangel.  An eight-member subcommittee on Nov. 16 found that Rangel
committed 11 violations of House rules by using congressional
stationery and staff to seek donations for an  academic center
named for him  at City College of New York, filing erroneous
financial-disclosure statements and using a rent-controlled
apartment as a campaign office.  “There can be no excuse for my acts of omission,” Rangel
said in the statement. “I’ve failed in carrying out my
responsibilities. I made numerous mistakes. But corruption and
personal enrichment are certainly not part of my mistakes and
the committee’s chief counsel made that abundantly clear.”  The committee’s chief counsel, Blair Chisam, told an ethics
subcommittee earlier this week he didn’t believe Rangel “took
steps to enrich himself.”  Rangel walked out of the Nov. 15 hearing after the
subcommittee rejected his request for a delay to allow him to
hire a new lawyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
