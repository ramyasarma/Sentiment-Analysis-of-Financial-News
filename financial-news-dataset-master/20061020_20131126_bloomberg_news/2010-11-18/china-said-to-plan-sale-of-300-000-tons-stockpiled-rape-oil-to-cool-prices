China will probably sell 300,000
metric tons of rapeseed oil from state stockpiles next week as
part of government measures to cool prices, three people
familiar with the matter said.  The State Administration of Grain, which manages government
grain and vegetable oil inventories, may announce the sale today
or tomorrow, said the people, who declined to be identified as
the decision hadn’t been made public.  The auction would follow sales of almost 300,000 tons of
the cooking oil from state stockpiles on Oct. 20. A telephone
call to the media office at the State Administration of Grain in
Beijing was not answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
