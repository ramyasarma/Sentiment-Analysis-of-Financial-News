U.S. Defense Department officials
responsible for weapons purchases will review  Lockheed Martin
Corp. ’s F-35 jet program next week to investigate delays in
development,  Geoff Morrell , a Pentagon spokesman, said today.  The review, scheduled for Nov. 22 and led by  Ashton Carter ,
the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, comes as the F-35 program
manager, Vice Admiral David Venlet, is conducting a so-called
technical baseline assessment of the $382 billion Joint Strike
Fighter, the third such study in less than year.  The assessment by Venlet is a “deeper dive so as to avoid
future surprises about this program,” Morrell said at a news
conference today. Already the Pentagon has found that there is
more software code “left to be written than what we thought,”
he said.  Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  will take into account the
review’s findings to determine the 2012 budget for the program,
Morrell said.  A December 2009 assessment of the F-35 jets, the Pentagon’s
most expensive program, led Gates to mandate a 13-month
extension of the development phase to November 2015, shift $2.8
billion in production funds for continued research and delay the
purchase of 122 jets to beyond 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
