Access Co. , a Japanese mobile-phone
software company, fell in Tokyo after the Ministry of Finance
said it plans to sell its stake at “an early date.”  Access slid 2.2 percent to 111,600 yen at the 3 p.m. close
of trading. Earlier it fell as much as 3.6 percent, the biggest
drop since Sept. 9. The benchmark Topix index rose 2.2 percent.  The ministry owns 5.87 percent of Tokyo-based  Access  as of
Nov. 15, it said in a filing today. It obtained the stake after
the family of a shareholder paid inheritance tax with shares.  The  Finance Ministry  will sell the shares at “an early
date” after watching market movements to determine the best
timing, Masahiro Kato, government shareholdings officer at the
ministry, said in a phone interview.  Toru Arakawa , Access’ founder, died in October 2009, and
his family had been discussing how to divide his assets,
including the shares, said Naomi Suzuki, an official at the
company’s investor relations section.  NTT DoCoMo Inc. , Japan’s largest mobile-phone operator, is
the biggest shareholder of Access.  To contact the reporters on this story:
