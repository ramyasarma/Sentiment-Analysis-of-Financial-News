United Arab Emirates Oil Minister
Mohamed al-Hamli said OPEC is “happy” with oil prices above $80
a barrel.  “Everybody is happy about this price,” al-Hamli said
today at an oil and gas conference in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.
With crude at $75 to $80 a barrel, “there is some sort of
stability.”  The U.A.E. is one of 12 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies 40 percent of the
world’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
