China, the world’s largest lead
consumer and producer, sold less than half of the metal on offer
from state reserves as a high floor price and remote storage
locations may have deterred buyers.  The State Bureau of Material Reserve sold about 16,535
metric tons out of 34,500 tons offered at an average price of
17,030 yuan ($2,564) a ton through public auctions on Nov. 16,
the National Development and Reform Commission said on its
website. The highest price was 17,080 yuan, and the lowest
17,020 yuan.  The reserves regulator has sold aluminum, zinc, paper pulp,
magnesium, sugar, cotton and corn from state inventories this
year in an effort to ease shortages and curb price gains. High
commodity prices helped push China’s inflation to 4.4 percent in
October, the fastest pace in two years.  “The floor price is a bit high given some faraway storage
locations,” Zhang Shu, an analyst at data provider Shanghai
Metals Market, said by phone today. “Some bidders said
transportation, for example from Gansu to Shanghai, is around
500 to 600 yuan, adding to the price, so it’s not economical.”
The floor price was 17,000 yuan a ton, the NDRC said.  Some of the lead ingots were stored at warehouses in
Yunnan, Gansu, and Heilongjiang provinces, according to an
earlier statement posted on the NDRC’s website.  Prices Fall  Lead prices in Shanghai’s largest nonferrous metals market
Changjiang were around 17,700 yuan a ton yesterday, compared
with 18,000 yuan a ton on Nov. 16, the day of the tender.  The metal, used in car batteries, is the second-worst
performer on the London Metal Exchange this year. The three-
month contract reached a 10-month high of $2,650 a ton on Nov.
11, and dropped 0.4 percent to $2,257 a ton at 10:40 a.m. in
Shanghai.  Some provincial governments in China started to limit power
supplies to smelters from October in an effort to meet the
energy-saving goal set by Beijing for the five-year plan ending
2010.  Still, “the impact of power curb on lead is very limited,
with few smelters affected,” Hu Yongda, an analyst at Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co., said by phone. “Besides,
there are ample supplies on the market, so it’s not strange they
didn’t sell much.”  The NDRC will auction a second batch of 117,000 tons of
aluminum on Nov. 23 and Nov. 24.  -- Helen Sun , Jing Jin. Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-
