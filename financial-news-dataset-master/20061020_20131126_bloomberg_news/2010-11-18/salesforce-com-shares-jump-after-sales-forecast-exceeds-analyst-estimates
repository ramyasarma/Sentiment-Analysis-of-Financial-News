Salesforce.com Inc.  rose the most in
two years on the New York Stock Exchange after forecasting
fourth-quarter sales that exceeded  analysts’ estimates .  Revenue will be $447 million to $449 million in the
quarter, which ends in January, Salesforce said yesterday in a
statement. Excluding stock-based compensation and some other
costs, profit will be 27 cents to 28 cents a share.  Analysts  had
projected sales of $424.6 million and profit of 28 cents, the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Salesforce, the biggest seller of online customer-
relationship management software, attracted about 28 percent
more paying customers than a year earlier, reaching a total of
87,200. Chief Executive Officer  Marc Benioff  said he expects
sales to approach $2 billion in fiscal 2012, a first for a
cloud-computing company, which provides software via the Web.  Salesforce jumped $20.97, or 18 percent, to $136.74 at 4
p.m. in composite trading on the NYSE, the biggest gain since
November 2008. The  shares  have added 85 percent this year.  “There’s a flight to quality, and there aren’t a lot of
larger-cap cloud-computing companies, so most portfolios will
have to have it,” said  Bradley Whitt , an analyst at Gleacher &
Co. in Dallas, who recommends buying the shares and doesn’t own
any.  Third-Quarter Results  Third-quarter net income rose to $21.1 million, or 15 cents
a share, from $20.7 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Sales
gained 30 percent to $429.1 million, topping the average $410.5
million estimate. Profit excluding some  costs  was 32 cents,
exceeding the projection of 31 cents.  Salesforce also is expanding its offices. The company said
on Nov. 1 that it bought 14 acres of land in San Francisco for
$278 million to construct a new complex. On Oct. 27, it bought
the remaining outstanding shares of its Japanese subsidiary for
$170 million.  Subscription and support revenue grew 31 percent to $403
million last quarter, accounting for most of the company’s
sales. Professional services and other revenue climbed 10
percent to $26 million.  In fiscal 2012, which ends in January of that year, sales
will be $1.97 billion to $2 billion, the  company  said. Analysts
predicted $1.92 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
