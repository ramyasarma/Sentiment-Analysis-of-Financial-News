(Corrects number of people who have reported for work in
second paragraph.)  Gold Fields Ltd., Africa’s second-
biggest producer of the metal, said a strike at its South Deep
mine continued for a fifth day today.  “The strike is ongoing and so is our engagement,”  Sven Lunsche , a spokesman for the Johannesburg-based company, said in
a phone interview. About 38 percent of the mine’s estimated
6,000 employees have reported for duty, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
