U.S. banks may postpone dividend
increases until the second quarter of next year after the
Federal Reserve issued new guidelines on capital levels,
according to a report by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The firm reiterated its view the “better positioned
banks,” including U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co. , could be the first to raise
dividends, analysts led by  Vivek Juneja  said in a note to
clients today.  The “higher profitability banks will benefit because of
the Fed’s expectation of capital accretion under any capital
plan after factoring dividend payments and net share
repurchases,” the JPMorgan analysts said. The second quarter
“could be the period for dividend increases.”  The Federal Reserve yesterday issued guidelines on how it
will decide whether large U.S. banks may raise dividends and buy
back shares, requiring the lenders to submit to stress tests of
capital levels. The Fed is asking large banks to submit capital
plans by Jan. 7, regardless of whether they expect to boost
dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
