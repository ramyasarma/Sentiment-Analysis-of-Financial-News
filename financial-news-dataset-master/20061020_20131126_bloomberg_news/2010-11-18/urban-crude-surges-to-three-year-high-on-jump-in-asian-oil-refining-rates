Abu Dhabi’s Murban oil surged to the
highest premium against its benchmark in three years as a jump
in Asian refining rates has boosted demand for crude.  Murban , produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., rose 14
cents for January loading to a premium of 75 cents a barrel
above its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest since September 2007. Qatar Marine
climbed 26 cents to a premium of 65 cents to its official price,
data from Bloomberg showed.  Refiners in Northeast Asia are boosting their output of
kerosene and diesel fuel to meet heating and electricity
generation demand. Japanese processing runs climbed to 82.5
percent of capacity versus 77.5 percent in the previous week,
the country’s Petroleum Association said yesterday. Chinese
plants have jumped to 87.42 percent of capacity as of Nov. 11,
higher than 86.9 percent two weeks earlier and 85.7 percent a
year earlier, the Shandong-based industry website Oilchem.net
reported Nov. 12.  Oman  crude for immediate loading plunged $1.32, or 1.6
percent, to $82.60 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.  Dubai 
for January declined $1.32, or 1.6 percent, to $82.31.  Murban 
dropped 1.4 percent to $84.34.  The  Brent-Dubai  exchange for swaps for January, or EFS,
widened 11 cents to $2.76 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for February
increased 11 cents to $2.88. The EFS is the price difference
between Brent futures and Dubai swaps contracts and signifies
Brent’s premium relative to the Middle East grade.  Oman futures for January delivery rose $1.23 to $82.33 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:13 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,224 contracts traded. The settlement price was set
