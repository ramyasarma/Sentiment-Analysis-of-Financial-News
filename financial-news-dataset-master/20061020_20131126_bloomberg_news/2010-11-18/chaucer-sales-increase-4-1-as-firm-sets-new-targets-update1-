Chaucer Holdings Plc , Lloyd’s of
London’s sixth-biggest insurer, said nine-month revenue climbed
4.1 percent on higher income from its U.K. division as the
company set new targets after a strategic review.  Gross written premiums were 676.9 million pounds ($1.1
billion) in the nine months to Sept. 30, compared with 650.3
million pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said
today in a statement. The company plans to become a “top three
dedicated Lloyd’s business,” it said.  Chaucer, like rivals including  Amlin Plc  and Hiscox Ltd.,
is seeking to expand outside Lloyd’s as competition between
insurers in the London market increases following two years of
relatively few costly natural disasters. The firm last year
fended off takeover bids from Novae Group Plc and  Brit Insurance
Holdings NV  after making record investment losses in 2008.  Chaucer is expecting price rises in 2011 “with increased
rates in the U.K. and energy divisions offsetting flat rates in
our marine division and decreases in our aviation, specialist
lines and property divisions,” it said in the statement.  The stock rose 1.25 pence, or 2.5 percent, to 51.75 pence
at 8:42 a.m. in London trading, valuing the company at about
284 million pounds.  The firm is expecting premium rates to increase 2.7 percent
this year as the company focuses on “market opportunities.”
Amlin, the biggest Lloyd’s of London insurer, said earlier this
week that rates fell 2 percent across its book.  Sales at Chaucer’s U.K. division rose 6.2 percent to 131.1
million pounds. The insurer sells car insurance outside of
Lloyd’s in its home market, where rates have been climbing at
the fastest pace on record.  New Goals  Chaucer released the results of a strategic review in a
separate statement. The company is targeting a return on equity
of 12 percent, seeking to reduce its combined ratio by 2 percent
and to expand its U.K. auto division through price-comparison
websites.  The combined ratio is a measure insurers use to show claims
as a percentage of premiums. The further the ratio is below 100
percent, the more profitable the insurer’s underwriting.  Chaucer will recommend a final dividend of 2.7 pence a
share for 2010, the same as last year. That “is a level we
expect to maintain for 2011,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
