Large U.S. banks may face resistance
from the Federal Reserve on dividend increases and share
buybacks as the regulator reviews their finances, Standard &
Poor’s said.  “We do not foresee many approvals for capital
distributions in the near term because we believe the Fed will
rigorously review large banks’ capital plans,” the ratings firm
said in a statement today. “We believe that several large banks
may still not have enough capital to deal with potential risks,
especially given how fragile the economic recovery has been.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
