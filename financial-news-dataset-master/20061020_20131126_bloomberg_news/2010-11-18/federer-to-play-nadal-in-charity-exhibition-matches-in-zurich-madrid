Roger Federer  and  Rafael Nadal , who
have won 25 of tennis’s past 30 Grand Slam titles between
them, will meet in a pair of exhibition matches next month to
benefit their charitable foundations.  The best-of-three-set hard-court matches will be played in
each player’s home country and televised on ESPN2.  Federer’s
foundation  will receive the proceeds from their Dec. 21 match in
Zurich, while the Dec. 22 meeting in Madrid will benefit Nadal’s
  organization .  “Federer and Nadal have rarely played each other on a hard
court surface -- and never at the U.S. Open -- so it will be fun
to see their styles in this environment,”  ESPN  tennis analyst
 Patrick McEnroe  said in a statement. “These are called
exhibitions, (but) whenever these two guys square off, the
competitive juices start flowing and the crowds and spectacle
will be terrific as each plays in his own country.”  Federer, a Swiss right-hander who has a record 16 Grand
Slam singles titles, is second in the ATP Tour rankings to
Nadal, a Spanish left-hander who has won nine majors. Nadal won
the final three Grand Slams in 2010 -- the French Open,
Wimbledon and U.S. Open -- after Federer won the Australian
Open.  Nadal holds a 14-7 lead in their 21 career meetings,
including a 10-2 advantage on clay surfaces. Nadal, 24, and 
Federer, 29, have split six matches on hard courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
