“Higher food prices are probably
here to stay” even if China proceeds with price controls and
other countries take similar actions, according to Brockhouse &
Cooper Inc.’s  Pierre Lapointe  and  Alex Bellefleur .  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a global food-price index
from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has
more than doubled since 2000. U.S. consumer prices, excluding
food and energy, have risen only 24 percent during the same
period, as the chart depicts.  China may establish price caps on “important daily
necessities” to contain inflation, the country’s Cabinet said
yesterday. Consumer  food prices  climbed 10.1 percent in October
from a year earlier, more than twice the overall  inflation rate 
of 4.4 percent.  Government-imposed limits “can have significant short-term
impact on agricultural commodities and food prices,” Lapointe,
a global macro strategist, and Bellefleur, a financial
economist, wrote today in a report.  Yet a growing  world population  and rising demand for meat
from emerging markets point toward higher prices over time, the
report said. Food producers will have to be able to pass along
cost increases to consumers in order to prosper, they wrote.  “World prices have risen alarmingly,” the FAO wrote
yesterday in a  study  of the food outlook. “The international
community must remain vigilant against further supply shocks in
2001 and be prepared.”  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
