A business boycott of  Arizona  over
its immigration law may have cost the state’s economy as much as
$141 million, a Washington-based policy group estimated.  Convention bookings for July and August fell 35 percent
from a year earlier, cutting lodging revenue by $45 million, the
 Center for American Progress  said in a  report  today. Lost
spending on food, beverages, entertainment, local transportation
and retail goods brought the total cost to $141 million, the
report said.  The boycott is aimed at an Arizona law requiring police
officers to determine the immigration status of people stopped
for questioning. The state’s credit may be affected if the
boycott harms tourism, Moody’s Investors Service said in May. In
July, Moody’s cut the state one level to Aa3, its fourth-highest
credit rank, citing “economic and financial weakness.”  “This significant hit to direct visitor spending could not
come at a worse economic time for Arizona,” said the report by
the policy group founded by former Clinton administration chief
of staff  John Podesta  in 2003. The center describes itself as a
critic of conservative values and a supporter of the progressive
movement.  Tourists  spent $16.6 billion last year in Arizona, where
the travel industry supports 157,000 jobs, the state Office of
Tourism said July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
