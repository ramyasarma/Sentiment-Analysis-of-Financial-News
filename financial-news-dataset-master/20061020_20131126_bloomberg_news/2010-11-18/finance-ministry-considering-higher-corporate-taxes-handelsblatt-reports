German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  is considering an increase in corporate taxes to fund
lower levies for small and mid-size companies,  Handelsblatt

the change, the newspaper reported today, citing Finance
Ministry calculations. Schaeuble is floating the idea before
leaders of Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s three-party coalition
meet today to discuss policy issues, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
