Toyota Motor Corp.  will sell a plug-
in hybrid model for about 3 million yen ($36,000) in Japan and
introduce 11 regular gas-electric cars by the end of 2012 as the
company aims to keep its position as the leading maker of the
vehicles.  Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, will introduce the
plug-in hybrid in Japan, Europe and the U.S. from early 2012 and
plans to sell 50,000 of the vehicles a year, it said in a
statement today. The carmaker will also add two electric
vehicles including a model based on its  iQ  compact that can run
105 kilometers (65 miles) on a single charge, the company said.  Automakers are under pressure from governments, customers
and environmentalists to sell fuel-efficient vehicles that
producer fewer or no emissions amid concerns over global
warming. Toyota, which introduced its Prius hybrid more than a
decade ago, faces increased competition as companies such as
 Nissan Motor Co.  and General Motors Co. add electric models that
run longer distances on battery power alone.  “Toyota was late to introduce electric vehicles but not
late in terms of developing electric-vehicle technology,”
Executive Vice President  Takeshi Uchiyamada  said at a press
conference in Tokyo.  Toyota’s iQ-based electric vehicle will go on sale in 2012
in Europe, Japan and the U.S. and be cheaper than rivals’
offerings, he said.  RAV4  The company, based in Toyota City, Japan, will also begin
U.S. road tests of a battery-powered RAV4 sport-utility vehicles
next year using components supplied by new affiliate  Tesla
Motors Inc.   A retail version due in 2012 will go 100 miles between
charges, Jim Lentz, president of Toyota’s U.S. sales unit, told
reporters today at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  Shares in Toyota rose 0.8 percent in Tokyo to 3,195 yen at
12:45 p.m. The stock has declined 18 percent in 2010.  Nissan aims to have capacity to build 500,000 electric cars
a year by 2012. Its all-electric Leaf compact will sell for
$32,780 in the U.S. and 3.76 million yen in Japan when it goes
on sale next month.  GM’s Chevrolet Volt costs $41,000 and runs 25 to 50 miles
on battery power. When the charge is depleted, a small gasoline
engine acts as a generator.  Toyota s also working on a fuel-cell vehicle that will have
a price of less than 10 million yen and is slated to go one sale
in 2015, Uchiyamada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
