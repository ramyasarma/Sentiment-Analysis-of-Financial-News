The difference in yield between 10-
year German government bonds and interest-rate swaps traded by
banks may widen because lenders would face losses in the event
of an Irish default, Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said.  “Swap spreads are generally likely to widen if the
question about European Union assistance for Ireland is not
clarified rapidly,” Ralf Umlauf , head of floor research in
Frankfurt, wrote in an investor note today. “Billion-euro
losses are possible if the country defaults.”  The  swap spread  was little changed at 35 basis points as of
7:05 a.m. in London, up from a low for the year of 16 basis
points on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
