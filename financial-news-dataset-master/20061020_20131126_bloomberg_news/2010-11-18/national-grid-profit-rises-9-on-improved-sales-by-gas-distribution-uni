National Grid Plc, the U.K.’s power
network operator, said first-half profit rose 9 percent on
improved sales from its U.S. gas distribution unit.  Net income for the six month period ended Sept. 30 climbed
to 760 million pounds ($1.2 billion) from 696 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based company said in a statement
today. Sales rose 6.1 percent to 6.4 billion pounds, missing the
6.58 billion pound estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Operating profit from gas distribution rose 30 percent to
324 million pounds, National Grid said. Net regulated income
rose 24 million pounds, driven by an increase in U.S. revenue on
customer growth and rate changes in New York. Warm summer
temperatures boosted electricity distribution and generation
revenues by about 33 million pounds.  “We have increased our capital programme, investing where
we are confident we can earn attractive returns,” Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Holliday  said in the statement.  Capital spending for the full-year will be around 3.7
billion pounds, National Grid said. The company invested 1.1
billion pounds out of 1.7 billion pounds in the U.K. during the
period and plans to finish the third phase of investment at its
Isle of Grain natural gas terminal, as well as the BritNed link
in this financial year.  “We believe that a strategic review of National Grid’s
U.S. operations is almost inevitable, including covering the
possibility of at least some U.S. asset divestments,” Citigroup
Inc. analyst  Peter Atherton  said in a note to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
