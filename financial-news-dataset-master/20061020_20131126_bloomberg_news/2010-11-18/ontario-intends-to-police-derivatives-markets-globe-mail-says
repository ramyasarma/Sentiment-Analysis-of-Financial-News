The Ontario government plans to
introduce regulations governing Canadian derivatives markets,
anticipating a similar initiative led by the Bank of Canada, the
Globe & Mail reported.   The planned legislation will be announced today as part of
the province’s autumn economic statement, the newspaper said.   Under the plan, bankers who trade derivatives would be
required to register with the Ontario Securities Commission,
which would have broad powers to supervise them, according to
the Globe & Mail.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
