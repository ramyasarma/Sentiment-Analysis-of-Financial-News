Mortgage rates  for 30-year U.S.
loans surged to a three-month high as bond investors grew
concerned that the Federal Reserve’s plan to buy more Treasuries
may fail to contain borrowing costs.  The rate for a 30-year  fixed loan  climbed to 4.39 percent
in the week ended today from a record low 4.17 percent, Freddie
Mac said in a statement. That’s the highest since the week ended
Aug. 19. The average 15-year  rate  was 3.76 percent, the McLean,
Virginia-based company said.  The $974 that would have covered the monthly payments on a
$200,000 mortgage at last week’s 30-year rate will now support a
loan of about $195,000. Rates had tumbled from 5.21 percent in
early April to last week’s lowest level since Freddie Mac began
collecting data in 1971.  Bond yields jumped as the start of the Fed’s second round
of debt-buying sparked “an international and domestic political
backlash,” according to  Steven Abrahams , the head of
securitization research at Deutsche Bank AG. The U.S. central
bank said Nov. 3 that it anticipates purchasing an additional
$600 billion of Treasuries through the middle of next year.  “The market apparently is discounting either the Fed’s
willingness to spend the full $600 billion announced or to
sustain the effort beyond June,” Abrahams, who is based in New
York, said yesterday in a report.  Bond Yields Rise  Yield on mortgage securities guaranteed by government-
supported Fannie Mae that most affect loan rates soared from as
low as 3.27 percent on Nov. 4 to 3.8 percent on Nov. 15,
according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Yields fell to 3.76
percent as of 9 a.m. today in New York.  Mortgage-bond yields help determine what lenders must
charge consumers on home loans to avoid losses when selling the
debt, which in turn provides cash for new lending.  The number of U.S. mortgage applications fell 14 percent in
the week ended Nov. 12, a Mortgage Bankers Association  index 
showed. Refinancing fell 17 percent, the most since early April,
and purchase applications dropped 5 percent, the Washington-
based group said yesterday.  U.S. housing starts fell to a 519,000 annual rate in
October, the fewest since a record low reached in April 2009 and
down 12 percent from a revised 588,000 in September, Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
