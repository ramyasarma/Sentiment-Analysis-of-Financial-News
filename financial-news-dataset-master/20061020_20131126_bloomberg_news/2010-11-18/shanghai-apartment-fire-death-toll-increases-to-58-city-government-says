Shanghai police have detained four
more people in connection with a fire earlier this week at an
apartment building that killed 58 people.  This takes the total number of those detained to 12, said a
media officer at the city government who wouldn’t give his name.
Managers from construction, project supervision and property
management companies for the building were among the detained,
Xinhua News Agency said today.  The municipal government yesterday began inspecting fire
prevention measures at buildings and work safety practices for
construction and maintenance, according to a statement  posted  on
its website. The central government has also ordered more
stringent fire control measures and  said  people responsible for
starting fires will be punished and businesses shut down.  Unlicensed electric welders are accused of setting off the
Nov. 15 blaze, which started on the 10th floor of the 28-story
building. The structure, which was undergoing renovations, was
covered with scaffolding made of nylon netting and bamboo which
caught fire easily. Eight people have been detained in
connection with the fire.  “This incident should never have happened and could have
been completely prevented,” Luo Lin, head of the nation’s State
Administration of Work Safety,  said .  Sub-subcontracting, which is illegal in China, poor
management and ineffective government safety supervision were
some of the causes of the fire, Luo said. Flammable materials
used on the block helped spread the fire, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
