Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin 
said she believes she could beat President  Barack Obama  in the
2012 presidential election and is considering whether to run.  Palin said in an ABC News interview that she’s “looking at
the lay of the land” for a possible presidential bid and
“trying to figure that out, if it’s a good thing for the
country, for the discourse, for my family.”  When asked whether she could beat Obama, Palin, the 2008
Republican vice-presidential nominee, replied, “I believe so.”  ABC released excerpts from the interview scheduled to be
broadcast on Dec. 9.  In addition to regular appearances as a commentator on the
Fox News Channel and a program, “Sarah Palin’s Alaska” on The
Learning Channel cable network, Palin has been raising her
profile with appearances and by speaking out on policy.  In a separate interview with the New York Times published
today, Palin, 46, said she is still considering whether to run
for president in 2012 and “having that discussion” with her
family about it.  The former Governor of Alaska, Palin was picked by
Republican Senator  John McCain  to be his running mate in 2008. A
Nov. 13-14 Gallup poll found that she got support from 16
percent of Republicans to be the party’s candidate in 2012, tied
with former Arkansas Governor  Mike Huckabee  and trailing former
Massachusetts Governor  Mitt Romney , who was supported by 19
percent.  She endorsed more than 80 candidates in the 2010 elections,
and at least 50 of them won, the newspaper said. She also raised
more than $10 million for Republican candidates and the party,
the newspaper said.  Her political action committee raised $2.5 million between
Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 and contributed $190,500 to candidates and
Republican political committees, Federal Election Commission
filings show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
