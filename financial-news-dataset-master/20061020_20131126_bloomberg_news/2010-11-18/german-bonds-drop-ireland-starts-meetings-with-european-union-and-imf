Irish bonds outperformed German debt
as the government moved closer to asking for international aid,
with central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  saying the nation may
seek a “large loan.”  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold 10-
year bonds of Portugal and Greece instead of benchmark bunds
also fell as stocks surged across the region, driving investors
from the safest assets. Honohan said he expects Ireland to tap a
loan worth “tens of billions.” Greek bonds gained as the
government said it plans to cut its budget gap by 5 billion
euros ($6.8 billion) next year. The yield on the German 10-year
security jumped to the highest since Aug. 2.  “There’s a sense of inevitability about Irish aid,” said
 Sean Maloney , an interest-rate analyst at Nomura International
Plc in London. “It can alleviate one of the uncertainties that
are out there and give these markets some temporary relief.”  Irish 10-year yields dropped two basis points to 8.31
percent as of 4:25 p.m. in London. The spread over bunds,
Europe’s benchmark government securities, narrowed 13 basis
points to 542 basis points, according to Bloomberg generic data.
The bund yield advanced 10 basis points to 2.70 percent, after
climbing to 2.71 percent.  Portuguese 10-year bonds yielded 405 basis points more than
bunds, down from 411 basis points yesterday. Greek 10-year
securities offered a yield premium of 886 basis points compared
with German equivalents, down from 903 basis points yesterday.  Spanish securities fell as the nation sold 3.65 billion
euros of 2020 and 2041 bonds. The yield on the 10-year security
rose nine basis points to 4.73 percent.  Stocks Gain  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  advanced 1.4 percent,
extending yesterday’s 0.5 percent gain. The gauge plunged the
most in four months Nov. 16 on concern that Ireland’s debt woes
may spread to other euro-area nation.  Honohan, speaking in an interview with Irish state
broadcaster RTE, said he expects that “a loan will be made
available and drawn down as necessary” by the Irish government,
and that the interest rate may be around 5 percent.  “It is my expectation that will happen, absolutely,” said
Honohan. “It will be a large loan.”  Greece’s government plans to cut the budget shortfall by 5
billion euros next year by cutting state spending and increasing
sales taxes to meet targets under a European Union-led rescue.  The deficit will decline to 7.4 percent of gross domestic
product, or 17 billion euros, from 9.4 percent of GDP this year,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based Finance
Ministry today. That compares with a target of 7.6 percent under
the May agreement with the EU and IMF to secure 110 billion
euros in emergency loans.  Spanish Auction  Spanish 10-year yields climbed 15 basis points to 4.80
percent, the most since July 15. The nation sold 4.85 percent
bonds due in October 2020 at an average yield of 4.615 percent,
compared with 4.144 percent last time they were auctioned on
Sept. 16. It sold 2041 debt at an average yield of 5.488
percent, compared with 5.077 percent at the September auction.  The 10-year auction attracted bids worth 1.84 times the
amount sold, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.32 at the
previous sale. The 30-year bonds attracted a bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.05, versus 2.1.  “The auction was decent taking into account the highly
risky environment for periphery,”  Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-
income strategist at UniCredit SpA in London, said in a note.
“Supply pressure should weigh on Spain into year-end.”  Fully Funded  France auctioned 2.5 billion euros of 3.75 percent notes
maturing in 2013 at an average yield of 1.18 percent, compared
with 2.03 percent at an Oct. 21 sale, according to Agence France
Tresor. The securities attracted bids worth 2.24 those offered,
versus 1.98. France also sold 2.5 billion euros of 3 percent
2014 notes at an average yield of 1.64 percent and a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.08, and 3 billion euros of 2 percent 2015 notes
at an average yield of 2 percent and a bid-to-cover of 2.44.  France also sold inflation-linked bonds due in July 2022
and July 2040.  While Ireland is fully funded until the middle of next
year, the  yield  on Irish 10-year bonds soared to a record 652
basis points above bunds on Nov. 11. Portugal’s yield spread
over Germany climbed to a record 484 basis points the same day.  Irish government bonds lost investors more than 12 percent
this year, compared with an 8.8 percent decline for Portuguese
bonds, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
securities returned 7.5 percent, France rose 7.1 percent and
U.S. Treasuries earned 7.4 percent in the period, the indexes
showed. Greek bonds lost 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
