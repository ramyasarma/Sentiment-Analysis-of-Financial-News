Allied Irish Banks Plc  subordinated
notes tumbled on speculation a bailout by the European Union and
International Monetary Fund will impose losses on bondholders.  “The traditional role of the IMF is typically the one of
the ‘bad guy,’” said  Philip Gisdakis , a Munich-based credit
strategist at UniCredit SpA. It will “have negative
implications for European banks, insurance companies and other
institutional investors, which hold the bank debt in question.”  Allied Irish Banks Plc’s 12.5 percent subordinated bonds
due 2019 were quoted at a bid price of about 45 percent of face
value, according to Jefferies International in London, down from
100 percent in September. Credit-default swaps insuring 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of the debt cost 5.1 million euros
in advance and 500,000 euros annually, according to CMA.  Irish central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said he expects
the country to ask for aid from the European Union and the IMF
worth “tens of billions” of euros to rescue its battered banks
and stop contagion across the region. The government already
pledged to impose losses on junior bondholders at Anglo Irish
Bank Corp. and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Anglo Irish was nationalized in January 2009 as loan losses
spiraled after a property bubble burst. The government also has
taken a 36 percent stake in Bank of Ireland Plc and is preparing
to take a majority stake in Allied Irish.  Credit-default swaps on the junior debt of Bank of Ireland
Plc cost 2.6 million euros in advance and 500,000 euros a year,
signaling a 55.7 percent likelihood of default within five
years. Contracts on Anglo Irish’s sub debt cost 7.9 million
euros upfront, showing a 99.95 percent probability of default.  Burden Sharing  Burden sharing “would have the obvious impact of hitting
sentiment across the bank subordinated debt spectrum,”  Harpreet Parhar , a strategist at Credit Agricole SA, wrote in a note to
investors.  The prospect of a bailout boosted confidence in the
region’s government debt, driving down the cost of default
insurance. Ireland led the decline, with swaps dropping 30.5
basis points to 493.5, according to CMA. Contracts on Greece
declined 17 to 939, Portugal fell 14 to 394, Spain was 4 lower
at 253 and Italy was down 3.5 at 183.5.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined 1.5 basis points to 164. The cost of
insuring against losses on European corporate bonds also fell,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 7 basis points to 456,
and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 1.25 basis points to 100.75.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros of debt from default for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
