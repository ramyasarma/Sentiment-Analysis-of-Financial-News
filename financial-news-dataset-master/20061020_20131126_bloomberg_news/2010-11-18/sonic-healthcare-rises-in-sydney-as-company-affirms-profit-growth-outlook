Sonic Healthcare Ltd. , the largest
provider of medical tests in Australia, rose the most in more
than a year in Sydney trading after reaffirming its full-year
profit growth forecast.  Sonic  gained  5 percent to A$11.25 at the 4 p.m. close on
the Australian stock exchange, the most since Aug. 28, 2009.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3 percent.  Net income will climb by 5 percent to 15 percent in the
year ending June 30, Sydney-based Sonic said in presentation
materials for its annual general meeting. The company, which
said Aug. 24 that cuts to government subsidies hurt demand and
trimmed profit last fiscal year, said today it is “returning to
normal growth trend” in the Australian pathology market.  Sonic said it is in a “strong position” in key markets
including Australia, the U.S. and Germany. Underlying industry
growth drivers also remain strong, helped by an aging population,
preventative medicine and new tests, the company said.  The outlook is based on currency rates in the previous
fiscal year and excludes contributions from new acquisitions,
Sonic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
