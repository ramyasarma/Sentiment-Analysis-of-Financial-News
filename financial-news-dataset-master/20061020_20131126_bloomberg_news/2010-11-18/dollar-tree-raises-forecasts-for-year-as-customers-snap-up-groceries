Dollar Tree Inc ., the third-largest
U.S. dollar-store operator, raised sales and earnings forecasts
for the year after customers picked up more groceries and beauty
products.  Profit will be at least $3.14 a share, excluding some
items, the Chesapeake, Virginia-based company said today in a
statement. In August, Dollar Tree predicted earnings of at least
$2.97. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was $3.09.  Shoppers bought more party supplies, health items and
housewares last quarter, pushing sales up 14 percent to $1.43
billion. The company, led by Chief Executive Officer  Bob Sasser ,
competes for customers with dollar stores such as Family Dollar
Stores Inc. and Dollar General Corp., as well as larger
discounters like  Wal-Mart Stores Inc .  The shares fell 90 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.81 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Dollar Tree
has gained 67 percent this year.  Sales for the year will amount to as much as $5.92 billion,
compared with a previous goal of up to $5.86 billion, Dollar
Tree said. The company operates more than 4,000 outlets
throughout the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
