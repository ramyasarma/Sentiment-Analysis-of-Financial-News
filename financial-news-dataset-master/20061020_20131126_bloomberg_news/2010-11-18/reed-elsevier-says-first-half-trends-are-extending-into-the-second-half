Reed Elsevier Plc , the owner of the
LexisNexis database, said “overall trends of the first half”
of the year continued in the second and reaffirmed outlook
comments from July.  “As previously stated, a modest reduction year-on-year in
adjusted operating margin is expected due to a weak revenue
environment and increased investment in legal markets,”  the
London-based  company  said in a Business Wire statement today.
“Any sustained recovery is expected to be gradual and remains
dependent on economic conditions.”  Subscription sales in many professional markets are still
constrained by “low customer activity levels and budgets,”
while advertising and other cyclical markets continued to
stabilize, according to the statement.  “In the second half we have continued to sharpen our focus
in key markets, through new product development, increased sales
and marketing activities, and portfolio realignment,” Chief
Executive Officer  Erik Engstrom  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
