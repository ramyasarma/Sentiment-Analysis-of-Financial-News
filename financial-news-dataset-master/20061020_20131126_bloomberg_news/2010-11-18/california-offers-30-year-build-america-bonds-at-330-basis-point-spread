California  began marketing $2.75
billion of taxable debt today, including $2.5 billion of Build
America Bonds.  A $1.65 billion segment of 30-year Build America securities
is being offered to investors at a yield equivalent to 3.3
percentage points above a comparable-maturity Treasuries,
according to a person familiar with the marketing. The  average
extra yield  Build America Bonds pay over 30-year Treasuries was
184 basis points yesterday, according to a Wells Fargo index.  A supply surplus drove the  average yield  on Build America
bonds to a seven-month high of 6.22 percent on Nov. 15, the
Wells Fargo index shows. It declined to 6.13 percent yesterday.  California Treasurer  Bill Lockyer  yesterday increased the
size of the taxables sale from $2 billion and shrunk to $1
billion a tax-exempt offering scheduled for next week after a
flood of issuance forced municipal-bond yields higher. The tax-
exempt sale was planned to be $1.75 billion.  Lockyer today also is completing a sale of $10 billion of
short-term notes needed to bolster the state’s cash position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
