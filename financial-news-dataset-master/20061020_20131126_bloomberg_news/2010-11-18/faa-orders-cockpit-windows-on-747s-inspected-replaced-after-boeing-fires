U.S. airlines must have cockpit
windows on their  Boeing Co.  747 jetliners inspected or replaced
after reports of fires on other Boeing planes, the Federal
Aviation Administration said.  The  order  is aimed at eliminating loose connections in the
electrical system that heats windows to prevent ice from
forming, the FAA said in a notice to be published tomorrow in
the Federal Register. The order covers 251 aircraft. The
inspections will cost carriers $5.4 million collectively.  There have been 11 reports of fires in the past two
decades, most recently in an emergency landing by a  United
Continental Holdings Inc. ’s United 757 at Washington Dulles
International Airport on May 16, the FAA said in July.  While there have been no reports of fires on 747s, the FAA
has said it planned an inspection order for those planes because
they have windows similar to other Boeing models that have had
fires. The FAA in July issued a window-inspection order that
covered 1,212 757, 767 and 777 planes.  To contact the reporter for this story:
