Ian Bell  struck an unbeaten century
and  Paul Collingwood  made 74 not out to lift England to 335-5
against Australia’s second string on day two of its final tuneup
for the Ashes cricket series.  Bell hit 121 at Hobart’s Bellerive Oval, smashing 16 fours
and one six in his 158-ball innings. He shared an unbroken 198-
run stand for the sixth wicket with Collingwood after the
touring team had fallen to 137-5. England leads by 105 runs
after bowling out Australia ‘A’ for 230.   The four-day game in Tasmania is England’s last warmup
before the best-of-five Ashes contest against Australia begins
Nov. 25 in Brisbane. England beat Western Australia and drew
with South Australia in its other two tour matches.  England, which holds the Ashes after last year’s 2-1 home
victory, hasn’t won a series in Australia since 1986-87.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
