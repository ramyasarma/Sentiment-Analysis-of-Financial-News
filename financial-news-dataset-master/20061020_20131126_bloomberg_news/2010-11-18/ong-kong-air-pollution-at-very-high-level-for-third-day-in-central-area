Hong Kong’s air pollution was “very
high” for a third straight day in the Central district, the
Environmental Protection Department said on its website.  The Air Pollution Index at roadside was 126 Central and 102
in Mong Kok as of 6 a.m. today, the department said. Readings
above 100 trigger a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory ailments to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic
areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
