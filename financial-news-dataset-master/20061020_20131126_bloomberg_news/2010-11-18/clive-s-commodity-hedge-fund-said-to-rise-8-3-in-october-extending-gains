Clive Capital LLP’s $4 billion
commodity hedge fund returned 8.3 percent in October, according
to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  That took Clive Fund Ltd.’s gain in the first 10 months of
the year to almost 11 percent, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because the figures are not public.
Clive Capital is based in London.  The average commodity hedge fund returned 0.75 percent last
month, and lost 3.5 percent in the first 10 months, according to
 data  from Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment companies
whose managers can trade any asset, aim to make money regardless
of whether markets rise or fall and participate substantially in
profits from money invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
