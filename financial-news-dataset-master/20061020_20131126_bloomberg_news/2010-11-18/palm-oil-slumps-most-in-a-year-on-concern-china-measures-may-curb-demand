Palm oil rebounded after tumbling
the most in more than a year as low stockpiles levels in
Malaysia, the second-biggest grower, raised concerns over tight
supply during the New Year holiday season.  The February-delivery contract, the most-active based on
volume, gained 1.6 percent to end at 3,318 ringgit ($1,063) a
metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, after tumbling
as much as 4.6 percent to 3,114 ringgit, the steepest loss since
Sept. 28, 2009. The January-delivery contract, the most-active
based on open-interest, slumped 4.4 percent to 3,125 ringgit a
ton before settling 1.8 percent higher at 3,329 ringgit.  “The rebound on the Dalian market sparked the recovery,”
 Arhnue Tan , senior investment analyst at ECM Libra Investment
Bank, said by phone from Kuala Lumpur. Gains were driven by
supply concern heading toward the end of the year as the current
reserves in Malaysia of 1.8 million tons is not enough to meet
demand, she said.  Malaysian shipments rose 26.6 percent to 747,431 tons in
the first 15 days of November from the same period in October,
Intertek said Nov. 15. Sales jumped 28 percent to 777,761 tons,
Societe Generale de Surveillance said. Output dropped to 14.3
million tons in the 10 months ended Oct. 31, from 14.5 million
tons, the nation’s palm oil board said Nov. 10.  Palm oil for September delivery on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange dropped as much as 2.8 percent to 8,352 yuan ($1,258) a
ton before closing 0.7 percent higher at 8,656 yuan. Soybean oil
for delivery in the same month tumbled 3.2 percent to 9,100 yuan
a ton, before closing at 9,384 yuan.  The Dalian Commodity Exchange said Nov. 15 that it will
curb “abnormal” trading to prevent price manipulation and
other activities that disrupt an orderly market.  Price Controls  China may impose temporary price limits on “important
daily necessities” and production materials to counter the
fastest  inflation  in two years, the State Council said on its
website yesterday after a meeting chaired by Premier  Wen Jiabao .  The measures “may curb China’s imports of soybean and
edible oils in the near term due to fears that the government
may release state reserves in the local market,” said  Ivy Ng ,
an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “It
may prompt traders to liquidate speculative positions due to
concern over weaker-than-expected export data,” she said.  China also pledged to stabilize natural-gas prices, crack
down on speculation in farm goods and ensure supplies of grains,
vegetables, cooking oil and sugar. Data released Nov. 11 showed
 consumer prices  rose 4.4 percent in October, the fastest in two
years, spurring speculation that the central bank will increase
interest rates for a second time this year.  Rate Hike Expected  Borrowing costs may be increased tomorrow, according to a
report in yesterday’s China Securities Journal that cited an
unidentified analyst. Rate decisions are often released on
Fridays, or around the 20th of the month, the paper said.  The central bank last month raised rates for the first time
since 2007.  January-delivery soybean oil gained as much as 2.9 percent
to 50.70 cents a pound in Chicago, while soybeans for delivery
in the same month rose 2.7 percent to $12.3725 a bushel.  “The price weakness is likely to be temporary as China is
unlikely to reduce imports of edible oils and oilseeds for long,
given the upcoming festive holidays,” said CIMB’s Ng, referring
to Lunar New Year celebrations in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
