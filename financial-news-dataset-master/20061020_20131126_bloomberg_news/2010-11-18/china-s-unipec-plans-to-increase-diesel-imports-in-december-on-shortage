China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Co., the nation’s largest oil trader, plans to boost
diesel imports for a second month in December to ease a domestic
shortage of the transport fuel.  China International, or Unipec, plans to import 120,000
tons for December delivery, compared with 80,000 tons in
November, according to an official with knowledge of the
transactions, who declined to be identified because of company
policy.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  and PetroChina Co., the
nation’s two largest oil refiners, are maximizing diesel
production in a bid to ease domestic shortages in the southern
and eastern parts of the nation caused by factories using the
fuel to power their generators.  Unipec, the trading unit of China Petroleum, is also
exporting less diesel amid the shortages. November shipments may
be as low as 10,000 tons, the official said. Exports were 90,000
tons in October and 120,000 tons in September.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors: Alexander Kwiatkowski, Aaron Sheldrick  To contact the reporter on this story:
