LDK Solar Co. Ltd., a Chinese solar
wafer maker, said a Venice appeals court upheld an international
arbitration award made in London in its dispute with Helios
Technology SpA of Italy. The Venice court agreed that the “take
or pay” clause in a solar wafer supply contract LDK had with
Helios was valid and at the terms and conditions specified in
the contract, the Chinese company said today in a filing. Helios
must pay LDK about $31 million plus interest, costs and lawyers
fees, LDK said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
