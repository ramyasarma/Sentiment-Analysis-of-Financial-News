Italy may miss its goal of cutting
the budget deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product
in 2012 if growth proves slower than the government forecasts,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  The government projects economic expansion of 1.2 percent
next year and 1.3 percent in 2011. The OECD also forecast 1.3
percent growth in 2011, lowering a previous estimate of 1.5
percent, and 1.6 percent in 2012, according to its semi-annual
Economic Outlook published today.  “Weaker growth than in the official projections may
prevent the actual deficit falling below 3 percent of GDP,”
which is the European Union’s limit, the Paris-based OECD said.
It also trimmed its forecast for 2010 growth in Italy to 1
percent from 1.1 percent estimated in May.  The OECD said it sees Italy’s deficit falling to 3.9
percent of GDP next year from 5.1 percent this year, before
dropping to 3.1 percent in 2012, when the government expects the
shortfall to come under the EU’s 3 percent limit.  Confindustria, Italy’s employers’ lobby, said yesterday
that the country’s economic growth is unlikely to exceed 1
percent this year and next as the recovery slows faster than
forecast.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
