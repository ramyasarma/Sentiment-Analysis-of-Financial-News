An Air Berlin flight from Namibia to
Munich in Germany was delayed for six hours yesterday after
authorities in the southern African nation found a “suspicious
parcel” at a luggage-screening point, the Namibia Airports Co.
said.  The flight left after all of its cargo had been removed,
the company said in an e-mailed statement from the capital,
Windhoek.  The discovery of the parcel came after German authorities
stepped up security at airports and railway stations after
receiving “concrete indications” that Islamist extremists plan
to stage an attack in Germany toward the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
