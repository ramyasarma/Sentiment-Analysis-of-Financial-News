Trakcja Polska SA , a Polish railway
builder, agreed to take over Tiltra Group AB of Lithuania in a
deal that adds 777.5 million zloty ($269 million) to a Polish
takeover market that already almost tripled from last year.  Trakcja  will buy at least 75 percent of Lithuania’s largest
builder, which also owns businesses in Poland, and at least 75
percent of Tiltra’s AB Kauno tiltai unit and 22 percent of
Silentio Sp. z o.o., the Warsaw-based company said in a
regulatory statement today.  The new company, Trakcja Tiltra, is aiming for annual sales
of 3 billion zloty by 2012, compared with a combined 1.9 billion
zloty today, Trakcja Chief Executive Officer  Maciej Radziwill 
said at a news conference in Warsaw today, adding that the deal
will be completed in the first quarter of next year and Trakcja
may skip its 2010  dividend .  “The price seems to be fair, although Trakcja isn’t just
getting Tiltra for free,”  Piotr Lopaciuk , an analyst at Erste
Group Bank AG in Warsaw, told Bloomberg News by phone. “The
whole idea looks right and Trakcja is finally making use of the
cash” it raised in its 2008 initial public offering, he added.  The sale gives Tiltra an enterprise value, or equity plus
debt, of about 7.5 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization and increases Trakcja’s value by
about 10 percent, Lopaciuk said.  Bank, TV Deals  The transaction adds to $12.7 billion of Polish mergers &
acquisitions so far this year, according to Bloomberg data, up
from $4.67 billion in all of 2009, after  Banco Santander SA  of
Spain bought Bank Zachodni WBK SA for 16.6 billion zloty in
Poland’s largest deal this year, and this week  Cyfrowy Polsat SA 
agreed to pay 3.75 billion zloty for Telewizja Polsat SA.  The maximum price of 777.5 million zloty ranks the sale as
the seventh-largest in this year’s Polish deal list.  Trakcja rose 0.6 percent to 4.78 zloty at 2:23 p.m. in
Warsaw trading today, while shareholder  AB Invalda  jumped 11
percent to 8.28 litai in Vilnius.  Trakcja will sell as much as 72 million new shares at 4.56
zloty apiece to Tiltra shareholders, including investment group
 Invalda , as well as 292.5 million zloty of bonds, with a 7
percent annual coupon. The Polish company will pay a maximum of
152 million zloty in cash. Tiltra’s owners will also buy
warrants entitling them to purchase 47.2 million Trakcja new
shares in 2013 at 6 zloty each.  After the merger Comsa Emte’s 51 percent stake in Trakcja
will fall to about 35 percent and Invalda will have 13 percent,
the Lithuanian shareholder said in a regulatory statement. Other
Tiltra shareholders will have 19 percent of the new company.  Trigon Dom Maklerski SA and Deloitte LLP are advising the
buyer on the transaction.  -- Editors:  Nathaniel Espino ,  Andrew Clapham   To contact the reporter on this story:
