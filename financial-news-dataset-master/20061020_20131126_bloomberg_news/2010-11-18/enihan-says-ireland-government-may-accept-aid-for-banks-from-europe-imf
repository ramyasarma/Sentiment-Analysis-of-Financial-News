Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
said the government could accept an aid package for its banks
after talks with the European Union and International Monetary
Fund conclude.   It’s possible that the funds would be made available “but
not drawn down,” Lenihan told lawmakers in Dublin today. His
comments are the clearest signal yet from a government minister
that the country will ask for a bailout.   To contact the reporter on this story:
