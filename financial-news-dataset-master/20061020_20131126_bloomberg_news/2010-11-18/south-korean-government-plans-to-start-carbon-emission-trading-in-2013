South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest
polluter, may adopt a carbon-emissions trading system in 2013 as
part of its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight
global warming.  The nation plans to give away more than 90 percent of
carbon permits in the first three years of its emission-trading
program,  Prime Minister’s Office  said yesterday on its website.
The rest of the permits will be put up for biddings.  South Korea said in November it plans to voluntarily cut
emissions by 30 percent by 2020 under a “business as usual”
scenario. The target corresponds to a 4 percent reduction from
2005 levels, according to Green Korea United, a non-profit group.  The government’s proposal still needs parliamentary
approval and public hearing sessions, Jung Do Hyun, an official
of the Presidential Committee on Green Growth, said by phone
today. The nation hasn’t set emission targets for companies,
according to the official.  Separately, the government announced on Sept. 28 that
companies with factories producing at least 25,000 metric tons
of carbon dioxide a year must set energy-saving and greenhouse
gas-reduction targets by September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
