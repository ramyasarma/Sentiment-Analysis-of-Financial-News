Corn and soybean futures rebounded
from five-week lows in Chicago on speculation that China’s plan
to slow inflation won’t reduce demand for crops imported from
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  China’s State Council said on its website yesterday that
price caps will be used on “important daily necessities” and
production materials, if necessary. U.S. soybean inventories
before next year’s harvest will be 30 percent less than forecast
in October, and corn reserves may drop to the lowest since 1996,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week.  “China’s inflation-fighting methods are seen as less harsh
than feared,” said  Richard Feltes , a vice president for R.J.
O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “Traders will be watching for
specific China measures to fight inflation, if none follow, then
Beijing simply talked markets lower to reduce buying costs.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 15 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $5.5425 a bushel at 10:18 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price fell to $5.22, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 8.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 29.5 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $12.345 a bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, the price
fell to $11.7525, the lowest since Oct. 12.  On Nov. 9, corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after the
USDA said adverse weather had reduced the size of the domestic
crop. Soybeans touched $13.485 on Nov. 12, the highest since
August 2009, as Chinese demand surged.  Rising Demand  Demand in China, the biggest soybean consumer and second-
biggest corn producer, after the U.S., will gain even as the
country imposes monetary-tightening measures because imports of
raw materials will be needed to curb food inflation, according
to Macquarie Bank Ltd.  China  became a net importer of corn this past year for the
first time in 14 years, USDA data show. The nation will buy 57
million metric tons of  soybeans  in the marketing year that began
Oct. 1, up 13 percent from the previous year, the USDA said Nov.
9.  “One of the most-effective ways to dampen domestic food
inflation is to import more, not less,”   Alex Bos , a Macquarie
analyst in London, wrote in a report dated Nov. 16. “We do not
expect a material pullback in China’s grain- and oilseed-import
demand.”  China may purchase 6 million to 8 million tons of corn from
Argentina for delivery in 2011, Bos said in the report. Imports
were a record 4.287 million tons from all sources in the
marketing year that ended Sept. 30, 1995.  Demand for dried distillers’ grains, a by-product of
turning corn into ethanol, may rise to more than 10 million tons
a year in China, an executive at Cofco Ltd. said today at a
conference in Beijing. Imports may rise to 2.8 million this
year, said Liu Xiaoyu, head of the feed division at Cofco, the
nation’s largest grains trader.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
