Liverpool captain  Steven Gerrard  may
miss four weeks after sustaining a “significant” injury to his
hamstring during last night’s England match.  “He’s just been in for an early assessment here and it
certainly looks like a significant hamstring injury,” team
doctor Peter Brukner said in comments published on the team’s
website. “He’s going to be out for a little while, I’m afraid.
I’d imagine it could be three to four weeks.”  Gerrard came out of last night’s 2-1 loss to France after 85
minutes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
