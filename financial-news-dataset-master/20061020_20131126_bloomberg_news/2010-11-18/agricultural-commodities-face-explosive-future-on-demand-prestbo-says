Agricultural commodities face an
“explosive” future as increased demand and the effects of
global warming exacerbate supply disruptions, according to  John Prestbo  of Dow Jones Indexes.  Agriculture, or soft, commodity prices will become more
subject to growing consumption in developing economies and
increased incidents of bad weather damaging crops, Prestbo,
executive director and editor of News Corp.’s Dow Jones Indexes,
said in an interview in London yesterday.  “With the global increase in population and there not
being extensive new farmland available to plant, soft
commodities are going to become more vulnerable to the kinds of
weather and other setbacks,” Prestbo said. “If you combine
that with some scientists’ predictions that global warming is
going to make storms either more frequent or severe, and shift
patterns of rainfall and drought, then you’ve got an explosive
combination.”  Increasing wealth in Brazil, India and China is boosting
demand for grains, dairy products, meat and cooking oils. The
 Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index  of 19 raw materials has gained 2.8
percent this year, with cotton, sugar and wheat rising as floods
in Canada, Pakistan and China and drought in Russia and across
Europe killed crops. The economies of China and India, the
biggest consumers of raw materials such as cooking oils and
sugar, are growing at three times the speed of the U.S.  Commodity assets tracking the Dow Jones-UBS commodity
indexes are an estimated $60 billion, according to Prestbo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
