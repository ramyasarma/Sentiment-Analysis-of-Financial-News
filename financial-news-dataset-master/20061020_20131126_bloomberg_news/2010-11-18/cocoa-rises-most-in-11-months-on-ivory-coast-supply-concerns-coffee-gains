Cocoa prices rose the most in 11
months in New York on concerns that supplies may be disrupted by
unrest during elections in Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest
producer. Coffee and orange juice also gained.  The second round of presidential elections, pitting
President  Laurent Gbagbo  against opposition leader  Alassane Ouattara , is set for Nov. 28. The West African nation’s cocoa
harvest will be 1.3 million metric tons in the year that started
Oct. 1, up 8.8 percent from the previous year, according to VM
Group and ABN Amro Bank NV estimates. Cocoa futures in New York
have lost 11 percent this year.  “We could see some disruptions towards the end of this
month,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial
Markets in Chicago. “That could slow down the movement of beans
through the marketing channels.”  Cocoa for March delivery gained $102, or 3.6 percent, to
settle at $2,939 a ton at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the largest increase for a most-active contract since Dec.
16.  Elections in Ivory Coast have been delayed repeatedly since
2005. The country remains divided into a government-controlled
south and rebel-held north following a military mutiny and civil
conflict in 2002.  ‘Political Premium’  “You’re going to see a political premium stay in the
market somewhat,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior-market
strategist at broker Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  In London, the cocoa futures for March delivery climbed 49
pounds, or 2.6 percent, to settle at 1,931 pounds ($3,096) a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Dollar weakness is also supporting commodities,
Klopfenstein said.  The  dollar  dropped against a basket of major currencies,
enhancing the allure of commodities as an alternative
investment. The euro rose against the greenback on optimism that
a bailout for Ireland will ease the region’s debt concerns.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 8.45 cents,
or 4.2 percent, to settle at $2.113 a pound on ICE, the biggest
gain since Nov. 9. Robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
advanced $53, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $1,911 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery gained 0.9 cent,
or 0.6 percent, to settle at $1.5285 a pound in New York. The
commodity has gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
