London & Stamford Property Plc (LSP)  said
Green Park Investments, its Middle Eastern venture partner, will
provide 100 million pounds ($159 million) of additional equity
to help finance the acquisition of five distribution properties.  London & Stamford will pay 123 million pounds for the
properties, which generate annual rental income of 8.7 million
pounds, according to a statement today. The tenants include the
Metropolitan Police Authority, Royal Mail Group Ltd. and Pearson
Plc, owner of the Financial Times.  The Guernsey-registered company  bought  five other
distribution centers for 82 million pounds on Nov. 5. The
venture will absorb the two portfolios, which will then be
refinanced, London & Stamford said.  In today’s statement, London & Stamford said the seller in
the latest transaction was a property fund advised by AEW  Europe 
and Tristan Capital Partners.  London & Stamford, founded in 2007 by Raymond Mould and
Patrick Vaughan to take advantage of the slump in property
values, will have 1 billion pounds available for further
acquisitions, including Green Park’s remaining commitment of 140
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
