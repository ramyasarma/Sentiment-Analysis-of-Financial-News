Schlumberger Ltd.  is cutting
borrowing costs by more than a third as the largest oilfield
services provider raises 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in its
first issue of notes in the currency in 20 months.  Schlumberger is selling the 2015 notes to yield 53 basis
points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, said a banker with
knowledge of the deal, equivalent to about 2.9 percent. The
company sold 1 billion euros of 4.5 percent five-year bonds in
March 2009 at a spread of 175 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Schlumberger is the first U.S. company to tap the euro
market this month amid investor concern the region’s budget
deficit crisis may spiral out of control. U.S. companies have
sold 13.2 billion euros of debt this year, less than half that
raised in the same period in 2009 and down from 40 billion euros
in 2008.  “The market here in Europe is becoming more challenging,”
said Simon Ballard, a London-based credit strategist at RBC
Capital Markets. “But on a name-by-name basis, with the correct
pricing there are opportunities for U.S. companies.”  Dallas-based Schlumberger is  rated A+  by Standard & Poor’s
and an equivalent A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company
is tapping the European market as the cost of borrowing for
similarly rated companies remains close to the lowest on record,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Yields Fall  The yield investors demand to hold A rated notes is 2.89
percent, down from 3.37 percent at the beginning of the year,
Merrill Lynch index data show. The cost of borrowing fell to a
record 2.43 percent on Aug. 31.  Corporate bond yields are being kept low as benchmark rates
are depressed by policy makers’ attempts to stimulate growth.
The five-year swap-rate is at 2.34 percent, down from 2.88
percent at the start of 2010. Germany’s five-year government
security is at 1.795, down from 2.5 percent in January. The
benchmark bond reached a record low of 1.18 percent Aug. 31.  Comcast Corp.,  the largest U.S. cable company, raised 625
million pounds ($999 million) in its first bond sale in the U.K.
currency yesterday. The 19-year securities were priced to yield
5.5 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Societe Generale SA are arranging Schlumberger’s issue that is
being sold through Schlumberger Finance BV, said the banker, who
declined to be named as the sale isn’t completed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
