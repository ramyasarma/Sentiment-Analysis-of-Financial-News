Gold climbed for the first time in
three days in New York as a weaker dollar boosted demand for an
alternative investment.  The euro rose against the dollar on optimism a bailout for
Ireland will prevent contagion across the region’s larger debt
markets, and before a report that may show U.S. initial jobless
claims rose last week. Bullion, which typically moves inversely
to the greenback, slumped 4.7 percent in the four days through
yesterday. It reached a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “Short-term uncertainty about the U.S. dollar is
supporting prices,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “Opportunistic
buyers with a longer time horizon are valuing these price levels
as a good opportunity.”  Gold futures for December delivery added $18.30, or 1.4
percent, to $1,355.20 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 1.5 percent
higher at $1,355.68.  Bullion rose to $1,356.75 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,337.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the government is
prepared to ask for a rescue package for its banks. European
policy makers will scan the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks
to determine whether the government can fix the banking system
on its own or needs to fall back on the 750-billion-euro ($1
trillion) European Financial Stability Fund.  ‘Substantial’ Bailout  Irish central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said he expects
the country to ask for a “substantial” bailout from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  A U.S. Labor Department report today will show the number
of Americans filing initial jobless claims increased 6,000 last
week, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Silver probably will top $30 an ounce in 2011 on demand by
investors seeking a protection of wealth, London-based research
firm GFMS Ltd. said in a report today. The metal will average
$19.94 an ounce this year and about $28 next year, GFMS said.
Futures have averaged about $19.13 so far this year.  Silver for December delivery in New York gained 4.2 percent
to $26.57 an ounce. It reached a 30-year high of $29.34 last
week and is up 58 percent this year.  Palladium for December delivery climbed 4.4 percent to
$683.90 an ounce. Platinum for January delivery was 0.7 percent
higher at $1,653.50 an ounce after falling the previous two
days. The metal yesterday slipped to $1,628, the lowest level
since Sept. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
