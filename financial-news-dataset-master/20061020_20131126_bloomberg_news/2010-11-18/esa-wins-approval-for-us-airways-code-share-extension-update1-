Mesa Air Group Inc. , a regional
airline in bankruptcy, won court approval to extend an agreement
under which it flies routes for  US Airways Group Inc.  and is set
to submit its restructuring plan for a vote.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Martin Glenn  in Manhattan said at a
hearing today that Mesa could enter into an amended code-share
agreement with US Airways. The changes extend the agreement by
39 months and resolve claims between the companies, according to
court papers filed Oct. 27.  Mesa, based in Phoenix, filed for bankruptcy in January and
is poised to submit its restructuring plan to creditors for a
vote. At today’s hearing, Glenn said that after reviewing final
changes, he would approve the company’s disclosure statement,
which describes the restructuring plan to creditors, clearing
the way for voting to begin on the proposal.  Under the plan, Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways is slated
to receive 10 percent of new Mesa stock and a $6.8 million note.
The US Airways code-share agreement generates about 70 percent
of Mesa’s  revenue , the company said in a court filing. The
agreement was set to expire in June 2012 and will now run to
September 2015.  Unsecured creditors with claims of about $2 billion will
receive new stock and $43.2 million in new notes, according to
court papers. Mesa is scheduled to seek court approval of the
bankruptcy plan Jan. 10.  The case is In re Mesa Air Group Inc., 10-10018, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
