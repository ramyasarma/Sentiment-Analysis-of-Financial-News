Hitachi Ltd.  said it developed
machinery to harvest rare earth metals from discarded hard-
disk drives and compressors as electronics makers seek to
reduce their reliance on Chinese supply.  The machine can extract 100 rare earth magnets from hard
disk drives per hour, about eight times faster than manual
labor, Tokyo-based Hitachi said in a statement today. The
company plans to get 10 percent of its rare-earth needs
through recycling when the business begins operating in
fiscal 2013, according to spokeswoman Satoko Yasunaga.  Japanese electronics makers plan to cut their dependence
on supply from China, which produces 97 percent of the
world’s supply of the materials also used in electric-car
batteries, wind turbines and missiles. China’s rare-earth
exports fell 77 percent in October from a month earlier as
the government cut quotas for the second half.  Hitachi rose 0.7 percent to 413 yen as of 11 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock exchange. Shares of the industrial group, Japan’s
third biggest company by revenue, have gained 45 percent this
year, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined
3.8 percent.  Rare earths refer to a group of 17 metal elements,
including lanthanum, cerium and neodymium, used in
manufacturing Boeing Co. helicopter blades, Raytheon Co.
missiles, Toyota Motor Corp. hybrids and Hitachi’s disk
drives and air conditioners. Japan is the world’s biggest
user of the metals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
