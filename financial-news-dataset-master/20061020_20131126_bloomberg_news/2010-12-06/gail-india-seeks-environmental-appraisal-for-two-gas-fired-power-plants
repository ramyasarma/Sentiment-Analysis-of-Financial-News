GAIL India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
natural-gas distributor, is seeking to assess the environmental
impact of developing two 350 megawatt gas-based power projects
in northern and central India.  The state-run company is eliciting bids from companies to
analyze the effect of the plants, planned at existing facilities
at Vijaipur in central India and Dibiyapur in the north of the
country, according to a tender  document  on GAIL’s website. The
chosen consultant would also help New Delhi-based GAIL get
environmental clearance from regulators.  GAIL is planning to invest in gas-fired power plants and
wind and solar projects, Chairman  B.C. Tripathi  told
shareholders Sept. 22, as it looks to meet rising demand in
India, Asia’s second biggest energy consumer.  The company plans to raise about $420 million borrowing
from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and selling local-currency debt
to fund projects, Finance Director R.K. Goel said Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
