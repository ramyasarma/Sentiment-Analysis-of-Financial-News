The FIFA World Cup attracted
309,000 visitors to South Africa during the tournament,
with fans spending 3.6 billion rand ($520.8 million) on
hotels, food and clothing, the Tourism Ministry said.  “The World Cup was a resounding success,” Tourism
Minister  Marthinus van Schalkwyk  told reporters in
Johannesburg
today. “It will reverberate for years to come.”  South Africa is betting that favorable coverage of the
country by television stations around the world during the
month-long tournament, which ended on July 11, will help
boost tourism and jobs in a country where one in four are
unemployed. The tourism industry makes up 7.9 percent of
the  economy  and employs 920,000 people.  “The money we’ve spent has been worth every cent,”
van Schalkwyk said. “The World Cup was never about the
hosting of a tournament, but rather about building a legacy
for our country and our continent.”  The number of visitors was in line with the
government’s
estimate, which was scaled back to as low as 250,000 from
an original projection of 450,000 as the global recession
and flight costs deterred some fans.  Fans from the rest of Africa accounted for 38 percent
of visitors who came to the country to watch the games,
mainly from
Mozambique, Swaziland and Botswana, the ministry said.  World Tourism  Of the European tourist arrivals, 22,802 came from the
U.K., 8,741 from the Netherlands and 8,596 from Germany,
the ministry said. More than 30,000 fans from the U.S.
visited the country for the World Cup, while 12,210 came
from Australia.
Brazil topped the list of South American visitors with
14,815.  South Africa spent 43 billion rand preparing for the
World Cup, including building or renovating 10 stadiums,
expanding roads and constructing a high-speed rail-link
between the airport and Sandton, where the stock exchange
is based.  World Cup fans stayed on average 10.3 nights in the
country, with 79 percent paying for accommodation and the
rest living with friends and family, the ministry said.
Gauteng province, which hosted the opening and final
matches in Johannesburg, attracted the most visitors at
223,039, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
