The International Olympic Committee
would be “delighted” to award an African city the right to
host the games, though the choice would be made on quality, not
location,  Jacques Rogge , the panel’s president, told reporters
in Durban, South Africa.  “If two countries of equal quality qualify, we’d prefer to
award the games to a region that hasn’t held the Olympics,”
said Rogge, who was in South Africa for an IOC meeting. The
country is “capable” of holding the games after proving itself
while hosting soccer’s World Cup this year, he said.  Sam Ramsamy, president of South Africa’s National Olympic
Committee, told reporters he wouldn’t disclose whether a city in
his country would vie to host the 2020 Olympics, following
reports in local media that Durban would make a bid.  “Bids have been received from South Korea, France and
Germany. As to bids from South Africa, I will evade that
question,” Ramsamy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
