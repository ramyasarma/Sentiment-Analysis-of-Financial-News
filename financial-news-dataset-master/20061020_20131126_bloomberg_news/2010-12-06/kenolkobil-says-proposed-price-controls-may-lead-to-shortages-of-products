KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, said price controls proposed by the government would
probably lead to product shortages in the East African nation.  “The price control suggestion is surprising since, as far
as we are aware, there has been no consultation by the
government or its regulatory bodies with major oil industry
players,” the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Any form of price control must be reviewed regularly by an
independent body and take into account all factors influencing
costs, including infrastructure inefficiencies, Chairman and
Managing Director Jacob Segman said in the statement.  Last month Kenya’s government blocked Kenya Petroleum
Refineries Ltd. from raising prices following a jump in gasoline
costs in the East African nation. The government told the
refinery, which is 50 percent state-owned, to improve efficiency
rather than increase charges.  Fuel retailers in Kenya increased prices last month because
of what they termed inefficiencies at the refinery, as demand
for fuel grew 7 percent, the refiner’s chief executive officer,
 Raj Varma  said Nov. 24.  Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  earlier this year refused to
sign a law capping the price of fuel, food and other essential
items, the  Daily Nation  newspaper reported on Sept. 2, citing a
memorandum sent to the office of the parliamentary speaker,
Kenneth Marende. The introduction of price controls would
contravene agreements signed with the World Trade Organization,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
