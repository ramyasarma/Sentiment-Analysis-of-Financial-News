Hedge funds increased bullish bets on
oil by the most in eight weeks as signs that the global economic
recovery is gaining pace stoked speculation demand for crude
will rise.  The funds and other large investors boosted so-called net-
long positions, or wagers that oil prices will climb, by 18
percent in the seven days ended Nov. 30, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of
Traders report. It was the largest increase since the week ended
Oct. 5.  Oil rose 6.5 percent last week and the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index advanced 3 percent after reports showed manufacturing
grew in Europe and China, and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  and  Deutsche Bank AG  increased their oil price
forecasts for 2011 and 2012. OPEC will meet Dec. 11 in Quito,
Ecuador, to review output quotas.  “Over the last couple of weeks sentiment has changed as
inventories are drawing down, the stock market is rising and
demand around the world has been good,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston “That has them
coming back in on the long side.”  Oil for January delivery rose 19 cents to settle at $89.38
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level
since Oct. 7, 2008.  Goldman Sachs increased its 2012 forecast to $110 from
$100, Deutsche Bank raised its 2011 prediction to $87.50 a
barrel from $80 and JPMorgan boosted its 2011 numbers to $93
from $89.75, saying that crude will reach $120 before the end of
2012.  ‘Bull Market’  “Looking toward 2012, the stage is set for a return to a
structural bull market in oil,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by
New York-based  David Greely  said in a report to investors on
Dec. 1. The 2012 forecast is based on “the better prospects for
continued robust world economic growth,” they said.  Manufacturing in the euro zone expanded at the quickest
pace in four months in November, Markit Economics said Dec. 1.
China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index grew at a faster rate for a
fourth month, climbing to 55.2 from 54.7 in October, the
country’s logistics federation said the same day.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
likely keeps its production target unchanged at the Dec. 11
gathering ministers from Angola, Venezuela and Libya said Dec. 1
and Dec. 2. Oil at $80 to $85 a barrel is a “comfortable
price,” Angola’s Minister of Petroleum  Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos  said.  OPEC Quotas  OPEC, which produces about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
hasn’t altered its formal limit since December 2008, when it
announced record supply cuts and a quota of 24.845 million
barrels a day.  Net-long positions  in crude oil rose by 24,461 futures and
options combined, or 18 percent, to 164,204 the week ended Nov.
30, according to the CFTC report.  The rise in long bets may not indicate bullish sentiment
for 2011, said  George Zivic , co-founder and chief investment
officer of Almanac Capital Management LP.  “Although we are slowly moving to tighter fundamentals,
the degree of recent moves in the curve are not justified,”
Zivic said. “It makes me think that people are more likely
capitalizing on the recent momentum of the market, and will
likely do so through the balance of the year.”  Product Demand  Demand for petroleum products  fell for a third straight
week in the week ended Nov. 26, the Energy Department said Dec.
1. Consumption dropped to 18.5 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since Oct. 15.  In other markets,  net-long  positions in futures and options
combined in four natural-gas contracts fell for the first time
in five weeks, declining by 10,437 futures equivalents to 71,647
in the week ended Nov. 30, the CFTC report showed. The positions
are held by what the CFTC categorizes as managed money,
including hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading
advisers.  The measure of net longs includes an index of four
contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas
futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps and ICE Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath, Louisiana,
is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for
the fuel.  Managed money’s bullish, or long, bets on  gasoline  prices
rose 4.3 percent to 65,434 futures and options combined, the
CFTC data showed. Net-long bets on  heating oil  advanced 1.1
percent, or 312 futures and options combined, to 27,238.  To contact the reporter on this story:
