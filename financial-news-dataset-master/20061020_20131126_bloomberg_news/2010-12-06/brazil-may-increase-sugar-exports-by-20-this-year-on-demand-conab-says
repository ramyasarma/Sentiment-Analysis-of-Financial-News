Brazil, the world’s biggest sugar
producer, may export 20 percent more of the sweetener this year
as Indian shipments slow and global demand increases, an
 Agriculture Ministry  official said.  The South American nation may export around 29 million tons
this year, compared with 24.2 million tons in 2009, Wellington
Teixeira, a sugar market analyst at the ministry’s crop
forecasting agency, said today in a telephone interview.  “World demand is very heated and India faces an output
drop, opening new spaces to Brazil,” he said from Brasilia.
“The trend is to see Brazil exporting more and more sugar.”  Sugar output in India, the world’s second-biggest producer,
fell 46 percent to 893,000 metric tons as of Nov. 15 from a
year earlier, according to a Dec. 3 report from the country’s
food ministry. Heavy rains have slowed the country’s harvest.  Conab, as the Brazilian governmental agency is known, may
lower its forecast for sugar output for a second time this year
because of dry weather, Teixeira said. Mills may produce around
37 million tons of the sweetener in 2010, less than 38.2 million
tons estimated by Conab in September, he said.  Conab will release its final output forecast on Jan. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
