The global financial crisis had a
limited effect on Italian banks, though some lenders must
“quickly strengthen” their finances, Bank of Italy Governor
 Mario Draghi  said.  “Some banks need to work more in order to quickly
strengthen their capital base,” he said in Rome at a press
conference to present the central bank’s first Financial
Stability Report. Lenders must reduce the weight of bad loans on
their books and be ready “to comply with new capital
requirements” of Basel II, he said.  The biggest risk to Italian banks stems from the slow pace
of economic growth and the report called on the government to
continue to cut its budget deficit to foster growth.  “The crisis has had only an indirect effect on Italian
banks, which are protected by their sound business model --
focused on lending to households and firms -- and by a prudent
regulatory framework and supervisory model,” the report said.
“The risks to banks stem mainly from the weaknesses of the
Italian economy, in particular its low rate of growth.”  The  risk premium  that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year debt over German bunds rose to a euro-era high on Nov. 30
as investors shunned the bonds of the euro-region’s high-deficit
nations. The government has pledged to bring its deficit back
within the euro region’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2012, even as slow economic growth weighs on revenue.
