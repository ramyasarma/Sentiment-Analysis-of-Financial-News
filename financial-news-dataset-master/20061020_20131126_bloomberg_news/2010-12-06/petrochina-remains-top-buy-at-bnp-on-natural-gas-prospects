PetroChina Co. is the top
recommendation among Chinese oil stocks because its natural gas
business may spur growth and the stock is cheaper than rival
Cnooc Ltd., according to BNP Paribas.  PetroChina had its price estimate for Hong Kong-traded
shares raised 8.8 percent to HK$11.70, analyst Bradley Way at
BNP wrote in a note today. China’s top planning body may
encourage PetroChina to supply natural gas to the northeast
region by raising prices, according to the report. Its yuan-
denominated stock rose 3 percent to 11.58 yuan as of
1:34 p.m. in Shanghai, the most since Nov. 11.                 To contact the editor responsible for this story:
