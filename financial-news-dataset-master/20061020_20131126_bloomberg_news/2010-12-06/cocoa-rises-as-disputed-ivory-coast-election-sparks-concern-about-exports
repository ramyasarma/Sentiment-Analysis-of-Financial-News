Cocoa jumped to a four-month high on
speculation that unrest may delay exports from Ivory Coast, the
world’s largest grower. Sugar fell, while coffee gained.  An election intended to unite Ivory Coast has turned into a
standoff, creating an increasingly violent political crisis.
Cargill Inc., a cocoa shipper in the country, said the unrest is
causing “challenges both in terms of delivery of beans and
logistics on the ground.” Prices jumped 5 percent last week,
the most since mid-July.  Political instability “could hold cocoa exports up for
quite a few weeks or a few months,” said  Eric Sivry , the head
of the agriculture-options brokerage at Marex Financial Ltd. in
London. “The market has the potential to shoot up.”  Cocoa for March delivery added $130, or 4.4 percent, to
settle at $3,065 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, prices rose to $3,084, the highest since Aug. 6.  The commodity may climb to $3,100, after closing above
$2,973, said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial
Markets in Chicago.  ‘Technical Buying’  “We are seeing some technical buying as well,” Cruel
said.  Cocoa prices have declined 6.8 percent in 2010 on signs of
ample supply. Global production may exceed demand by 100,000
tons in the season started Oct. 1, the International Cocoa
Organization said on Oct. 13.  “On a fundamental, supply and demand basis, there’s more
cocoa around than in the past five years as the crop is
promising to be very, very good,” Marex’s Sivry said.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery gained 86
pounds, or 4.4 percent, to 2,045 pounds ($3,215) a ton on NYSE
Liffe. Earlier, prices surged to 2,046 pounds, the highest since
Aug. 26.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.49 cent, or 1.7
percent, to 29.01 cents a pound in New York. On NYSE Liffe,
refined-sugar futures for March delivery added $3.80, or 0.5
percent, to $743.80 a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 4.15 cents,
or 2 percent, to $2.0895 a pound on ICE. In London, robusta-
coffee futures for March delivery declined $4, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,860 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
