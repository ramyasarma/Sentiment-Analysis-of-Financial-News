Australia’s dollar declined after the
central bank held interest rates steady and called them
“appropriate,” curbing speculation on widening yield premiums on
the nation’s assets. New Zealand’s dollar also slipped after
commodities retreated from an advance.  The Aussie fell for a second day against the U.S. dollar
after the Reserve Bank of Australia left the overnight cash rate
target at 4.75 percent. It rose to a three-week high as
commodities surged after U.S. lawmakers reached an agreement to
sustain tax reductions, then resumed a drop as raw materials
declined.  “Increasingly, the risks are that now the RBA will be
sidelined till the middle of 2011,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior
currency strategist in Hong Kong at Royal Bank of Canada. “The
Aussie’s direction is going to be dependent on European
peripheral developments.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 98.77 U.S. cents at
12:51 p.m. in New York, from 98.99 cents yesterday. It rose as
high as 99.65 cents, the strongest since Nov. 12. The Aussie was
up 0.6 percent to 82.30 yen, from 81.82. New Zealand’s dollar
dropped 0.1 percent to 76.07 U.S. cents, from 76.17, and
strengthened 0.6 percent to 63.35 yen, from 62.95 yen.  The  Reuters-Jefferies CRB Index  of raw materials fell 0.6
percent after earlier rising as much as 1.1 percent.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  said inflation likely will be
contained through the middle of next year and noted the market’s
growing concern about the creditworthiness of some European
nations.  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  cut spending and
raised taxes by 6 billion euros ($8 billion) to deal with what
he called the “worst crisis in our history” as the government
seeks to seal an 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) international
aid package. European Union and International Monetary Fund
officials agreed to the package to keep Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis from spreading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
