Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. filed
an amended complaint against billionaire Carl Icahn, reiterating
that he was “secretly plotting” to profit from merging the
studio with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. while telling investors the
deal would be a “debacle.”  Icahn should correct his misstatements, compensate Lions
Gate investors and pay damages for interfering in the company’s
plans, the studio said in a Dec. 3 filing in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
