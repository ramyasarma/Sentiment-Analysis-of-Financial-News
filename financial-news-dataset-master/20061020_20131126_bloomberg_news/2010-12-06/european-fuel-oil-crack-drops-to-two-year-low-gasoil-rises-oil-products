Europe’s gasoil crack, or premium to
Brent crude oil, expanded for a third day as colder-than-usual
weather gripped most of Europe. Futures prices rose.  Vitol Group purchased two lots of jet fuel at the highest
premium to December gasoil since January this year.  Light Products  Gasoline barges  for immediate loading in northwest Europe
traded from $833 to $843 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and Platts pricing window. That compares with Dec. 3
trades from $826 to $838. The trades are for Eurobob grade to
which ethanol is added to make finished motor fuel.  Premium unleaded gasoline traded from $841 to $848 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts. The grade climbed to $839 on
Dec. 3, the highest price since Oct. 1, 2008.  Brent was little changed at $91.38 a barrel compared with
$91.42 on Dec. 3.  Middle Distillates  Vitol purchased 2,000 tons of jet fuel from Morgan Stanley
and the same volume from Glencore International AG at a premium
of $63 a ton to December ICE gasoil, according to a survey of
brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing window which
ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. That’s the highest premium since
Jan. 29 and compares with Dec. 2 trades at a $58 premium.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $5.50 to $6.50 a ton
to December ICE gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with
Dec. 2 deals at discounts of $7.50 and $8.  Gasoil for December delivery increased 0.5 percent to
$765.50 a ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. The fuel
for January traded at $770.50 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack widened to $12.27 a barrel from $11.57 on
Dec. 3, according to ICE data.  Demand in Germany, Europe’s biggest market for the fuel
used in heating, may rise because of freezing weather, said
 Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at Credit Agricole
CIB. “It’s very cold in Germany, they’ll be using a lot of
heating oil.”  Temperatures in Munich in southern Germany won’t go above 1
degree Celsius (34 Fahrenheit), according to data on Bloomberg.
That’s below the five-year average of 7 degrees Celsius, the
data show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums of $24 to
$26 a ton to December ICE gasoil, according to the Platts
survey. That compares with Dec. 3 trades at $23 and $24 above
the gasoil contract.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Brent dropped to $16.20
a barrel, the lowest level since January 2009, amid signs Russia
is increasing exports. Russian  fuel oil  exports from the St.
Petersburg oil terminal rose 8.1 percent to 803,000 tons in
November from the same month a year ago, according to a port
official.  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $476.50 to $479.50
a ton, according to the Platts survey. Low-sulfur fuel oil
barges traded at $490 a ton, the survey showed.  High-sulfur fuel oil is used as a shipping fuel and in
power generation in some countries.  Refinery News  Motor Oil Hellas SA, the second-largest Greek refiner,
plans to halt the older of two crude units at its  Corinth  plant
for maintenance in January.  Work on the 110,000 barrel-a-day unit will last about three
weeks,  Petros Tzannetakis , Motor Oil’s chief financial officer,
said today in a telephone interview from Athens.  Unipetrol AS’s Ceska Rafinerska unit is continuing to
supply contracted fuel to customers after a fire at its refinery
in Litvinov on Dec. 3 damaged a hydrocracker, a company
spokesman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
