Roche Holding AG ’s experimental
schizophrenia medicine RG1678 reduced symptoms, and a new
treatment for a kind of blood cancer “showed promising response
rates,” mid-stage studies found.  The schizophrenia drug was also linked to beneficial
changes in patients’ personal and social functioning, the Basel-
based company said today in a statement.  As many as 55 percent of patients responded to treatment
with the experimental compound GA101, which is being tested for
use in people with difficult-to-treat Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who
have failed multiple previous treatments, the company said in a
another  statement . Roche gained GA101 through its 235-million
Swiss franc ($241 million) acquisition in 2005 of Switzerland’s
GlycArt. Both RG1678 and GA101 are in the second of three stages
of clinical development generally needed to win regulatory
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
