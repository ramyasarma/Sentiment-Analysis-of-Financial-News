Worldwide advertising spending will
continue to recover next year, led by expanded Internet
marketing and outlays in emerging economies, according to
researchers  ZenithOptimedia Group Ltd.  and Magna Global.  Spending will increase 4.6 percent next year, after
“surprisingly strong” 4.9 percent growth in 2010, said
ZenithOptimedia, a company owned by  Publicis Groupe SA  that buys
advertising for clients including drugmaker  Sanofi-Aventis SA .
Magna, which tracks ad sales not spending, projects 5.4 percent
growth in 2011, following a 6.9 percent gain this year.  Web advertising is growing three times faster than the
market as a whole, according to ZenithOptimedia. China will
become the third-largest ad market behind the U.S. and Japan
next year, displacing Germany, it said. While spending is
recovering after the 2008 financial crisis, advertising growth
is short of the “long-term trend rate of 6 percent,” London-
based ZenithOptimedia said.  “The key result of this update is the continued rise of
developing markets and digital media, and their central role in
driving global growth,” ZenithOptimedia Chief Executive Officer
 Steve King  said in the report.  In a separate forecast,  WPP Plc ’s GroupM media-buying
unit said today that global ad spending will probably exceed
$500 billion in 2011 for the first time. Ad spending will
increase 5.8 percent over 2010’s $474 billion, the company said
in a statement.  ‘Significant Rebound’  “We’ve seen a significant rebound in advertising spending
in the U.S. over the last six months,” GroupM Chief Investment
Officer  Rino Scanzoni  said in the statement.  WPP’s Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  told Bloomberg
TV in an interview today that the U.S. ad market is “marked by
a bounceback” of traditional advertising, behaving more like an
emerging market than a mature one. Sorrell added that the U.S.
market will not grow as strongly in 2011.  WPP, the world’s largest ad company, continues to seek
small-and-medium-sized acquisitions and is seeing “some
excesses” in the mergers and acquisitions market, Sorrell said.  GroupM said measured global advertising recovered nearly
all the dollars it lost in 2009. ZenithOptimedia said that
worldwide ad spending won’t exceed the 2008 peak until 2012.
High debt in the developed world, U.S. unemployment and default
concerns in the Eurozone pose risks to growth, the agency said.  ZenithOptimedia predicts growth of 5.2 percent in 2012 and
2013. Worldwide ad spending will total $449.7 billion this year,
the company said.  Web, Print, TV  Web spending will rise from 14 percent of the market in
2010 to 18 percent in 2013, fueled by video and social media,
ZenithOptimedia said. Newspaper and magazine outlays will shrink
2 percent. TV remains the dominant medium and will expand its
share to 42 percent by 2013 from 41 percent this year.  Growth in Internet outlays may be even larger given Web-
related “activities that do not count as ad expenditure in the
traditional sense,” King said in the report.  With ad spending growth of 51 percent projected for the
next two years, China will overtake Germany as the world’s
third-largest ad market in 2011, ZenithOptimedia said. Asia
Pacific spending will rise 23 percent, the company said.  Expenditures in Latin America are projected to grow 26
percent from 2010 to 2013, while North America will increase 9
percent and Japan 5 percent during the same period, according to
ZenithOptimedia. Spending in central and Eastern Europe will
increase 31 percent.  Magna, owned by  Interpublic Group of Cos. , estimates
advertising sales worldwide will increase 5.4 percent to $412
billion next year and top the firm’s prior growth estimate of
4.2 percent with Argentina, India and China leading the way.  The ad market recovered more quickly this year than
anticipated, with projected 6.9 percent growth outpacing the
firm’s 5.6 percent estimate.  Online advertising will overtake newspapers as the world’s
second-largest ad medium behind TV by 2013, New York-based Magna
said. Internet ad revenue may reach $117 billion by 2016, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
