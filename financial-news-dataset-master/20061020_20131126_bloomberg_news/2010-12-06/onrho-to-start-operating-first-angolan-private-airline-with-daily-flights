Lonrho Plc , an investment holding
company with infrastructure assets in 17 African countries, will
begin operating Angola’s first privately owned commercial
airline, with daily flights within the next week.  “We’re starting, hopefully, within the next week to fly
from Luanda to Cabinda and to Soyo,” Executive Chairman David
Lenigas said after the company released financial results for
the year ended September. The domestic service will begin with a
single aircraft serving the north of the country from the
capital Luanda three times a day. “An additional two aircraft
will be arriving from Europe within four to six weeks,” said
Lenigas. Lonrho has invested $10 million in the airline so far,
he said.  Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil producer, is rebuilding
after a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.  Lonrho  owns
Fly540, which has been operating in Kenya since 2006, and its
only competition in Angola is private charter airlines, Lenigas
said. Service in the country will grow to six domestic routes
with a total of six aircraft within the next six months, he said
in a telephone interview today.  “Only then will we look at expanding in the region,” said
Lenigas. “Our plan is to fly in all four directions across
Africa, but we first need to establish ourselves domestically.”  In the first quarter of 2011, Fly540 will start a West
Africa regional operation out of Ghana’s capital, Accra, flying
to Senegal and Equatorial Guinea, Lenigas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
