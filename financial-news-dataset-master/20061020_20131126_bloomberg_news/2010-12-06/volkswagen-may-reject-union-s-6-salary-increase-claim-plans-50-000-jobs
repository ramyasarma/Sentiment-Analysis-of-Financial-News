Volkswagen AG  may oppose demands by
the German IG Metall labor union for 6 percent more pay for the
carmaker’s workers in western Germany as VW plans to add
thousands of jobs in its home-market and abroad.  Europe’s largest automaker may create 50,000 jobs globally
by 2015, with around 10 percent of the positions in Germany, its
second-biggest market after China, personnel chief  Horst Neumann 
told German newspaper  Handelsblatt . Spokesman  Stefan Ohletz 
confirmed the comments.  New job openings in Germany require VW being able to
improve “its competitiveness as planned,” Neumann said. Wages
may increase by more than 2.7 percent, reflecting a raise for
engineering staff already agreed last February plus performance-
linked bonuses to be granted in May 2011, he said.  Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW’s nine-month  net income  jumped
fivefold to 3.78 billion euros ($5 billion) while global sales
are set to exceed last year’s record of 6.29 million cars, vans
and sport-utility vehicles. VW plans to invest 51.6 billion
euros in the automotive business through 2015 to help reach a
goal of surpassing  Toyota Motor Corp.  in sales and profit.  Volkswagen “is speeding from record-to-record and is
better positioned than competitors,”  Hartmut Meine , the IG
Metall’s chief wage negotiator said today in an e-mailed
statement. “The demand for 6 percent more pay is appropriate
and well justified.”  Shares Advance  VW’s preferred  shares  rose as much as 4.30 euros, or 3.2
percent, to 139.45 euros and were up 1.9 percent to 137.70 euros
as of 1:12 p.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has gained 111
percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 58.5 billion euros.  Germany’s biggest union said today it will hold the first
set of pay negotiations with VW on Jan. 19, less than two weeks
before the current 18-month contract, which earned workers a 4.2
percent raise plus one-off payments, expires on Jan. 31.  IG Metall is legally banned from calling strikes at
 Volkswagen ’s seven western German factories until Feb. 28, 2011,
when a four-week cooling off period expires. Besides the 95,000
manufacturing workers, IG Metall is also negotiating pay for
5,000 staff at the carmaker’s financial services division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
