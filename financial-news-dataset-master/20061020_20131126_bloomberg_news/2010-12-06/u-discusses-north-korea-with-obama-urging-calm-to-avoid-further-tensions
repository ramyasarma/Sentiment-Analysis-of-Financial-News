Chinese president Hu Jintao called
for “calm and rational” response from all sides to prevent the
deterioration of the security situation on the Korean Peninsula,
Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Hu’s telephone conversation
with U.S. president Barack Obama.  China is “greatly concerned about” the current tension on
the peninsula and said the security situation “could lead to
further escalation of tension, or even run out of control” if
it’s not properly handled, Hu was quoted as saying by Xinhua.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
