LG Display Co. ,  Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corp.  and three other companies may be fined up
to 700 million euros ($930 million) by the European Union for
fixing the price of liquid-crystal display panels, Reuters said.  Samsung Electronics Co.  may escape fines, to be levied on
Wednesday, because it was the first in the cartel to inform the
European Commission, Reuters said today. LCD panels are used in
mobile phones, televisions and computers.  Chi Mei, which  merged  with Innolux Display Corp. in March
to form  Chimei Innolux Corp. , pleaded guilty to U.S. antitrust
charges last year and agreed to pay $220 million in fines.  LG Display and Samsung said in 2006 they were being probed
by regulators around the world over alleged price fixing.  AU
Optronics Corp. , Taiwan’s second-largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, said it received a formal complaint from the  European
Commission  in May 2009.  Bang-Soo Lee, a spokesman for LG Display, didn’t
immediately respond to a call or e-mail outside normal office
hours. A call to Samsung Electronics press office in Seoul and
calls and e-mails to Chi Mei representatives Eddie Chen and
Loreta Chen in Taiwan weren’t answered outside normal business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
