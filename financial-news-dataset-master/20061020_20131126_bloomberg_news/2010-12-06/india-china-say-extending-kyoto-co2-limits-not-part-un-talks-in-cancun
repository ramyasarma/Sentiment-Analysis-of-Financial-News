India and China said extension of
greenhouse gas emissions cuts under the Kyoto Protocol, short-
term finance and technology transfer from rich to poor countries
are not up for negotiation in United Nations climate change
talks in Mexico this week.  Officials from India, China, South Africa and Brazil
outlined their demands at a news conference today in Cancun,
where high-level negotiations are set to begin tomorrow.  The countries will do “all that we need” to do to ensure
success at the talks in Cancun, though issues around the 1997
Kyoto Protocol, climate finance and technology transfer are
“three non-negotiables as far as we are concerned,” India
Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
