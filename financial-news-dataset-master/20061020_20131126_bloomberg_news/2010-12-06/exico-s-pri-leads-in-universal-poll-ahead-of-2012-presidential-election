Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI, is favored to win the 2012 presidential
elections, according to a  poll  by newspaper El Universal and
Berumen y Asociados.  The party, which governed Mexico for seven decades until
2000, was favored by 27 percent of 2,205 people surveyed
nationwide between Nov. 18 and 22. President  Felipe Calderon ’s
National Action Party, or PAN, has 24 percent support and the
opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, has 10
percent, according to the poll, whose margin of error is plus or
minus 3.2 percentage points.  Enrique Pena Nieto , governor of the state of Mexico and a
PRI member, was backed by 41 percent of those surveyed in a
possible race against Calderon’s finance minister,  Ernesto Cordero , and PRD’s  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador . In that
scenario, Cordero had 12 percent support and Lopez Obrador, who
ran for the PRD in the 2006 presidential race, had 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
