Bloomberg LP, parent of  Bloomberg
News , reached an agreement to have an office building
constructed in the City of London financial district that will
be the company’s European headquarters.  The property will be built on a site close to the Bank of
England that’s owned by U.K. insurer  Legal & General Group Plc ,
New York-based Bloomberg said in a Business Wire statement
today. Two buildings will be constructed, with one larger than
500,000 square feet (46,500 square meters) and the other
“speculative,” according to the statement.  The project will be the biggest commercial development
announced in the City since August, when UBS AG agreed to have
an office property added to the Broadgate complex. The office
building will be designed with  Foster + Partners , founded by
British architect  Norman Foster .  “Bloomberg’s London headquarters has always been an
integral part of the company,” said  Peter Grauer , chairman of
Bloomberg LP. “This new project underscores our commitment to
London and to expanding our presence in this world-class
financial capital.”  Bloomberg, which currently has almost 300,000 terminal
subscribers, said construction should begin in 2012 and be
completed in 2015. The company didn’t say how much it will pay
for the building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
