Lindsey Vonn , the three-time
defending World Cup overall ski champion, claimed the season-
opening Super-G race in Lake Louise, Canada, after finishing
second to  Maria Riesch  in two downhill events.  Vonn, who won an Olympic downhill gold medal in February,
finished in a time of 1 minute, 20.72 seconds and beat the field
by almost a second for her first World Cup win of the year.  “I dropped the hammer a little bit more and believed in
myself,” Vonn, who won in Lake Louise for the eighth time in
six years, said in comments distributed by the  U.S. Ski Team.   Germany’s Riesch was second in 1:21.55 while American  Julia Mancuso  was third in 1:21.61.  Vonn’s victory came before fellow Olympic gold medalist  Ted Ligety  won the men’s giant slalom in Beaver Creek, Colorado. The
reigning World Cup giant slalom champion, Ligety won by eight-
tenths of a second over Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud.  It was the first time since 2006 that two Americans won
World Cup races on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
