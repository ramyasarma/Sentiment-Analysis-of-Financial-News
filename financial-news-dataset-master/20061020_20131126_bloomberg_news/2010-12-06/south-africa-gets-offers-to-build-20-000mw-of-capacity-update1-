South Africa, the continent’s largest
carbon emitter, received 384 applications from companies seeking
to build a combined 20,000 megawatts of renewable power projects
as part of a plan to curb reliance on coal-fired energy.  The government will issue a procurement document with the
projects approved in the first quarter, Ompi Aphane, deputy
director-general for electricity, nuclear and clean energy at
the Department of Energy, told reporters in Pretoria today.  South Africa is struggling with a power shortage resulting
from a government decision to halt expansion plans by state-run
utility Eskom Holdings Ltd. for four years to try to encourage
private companies to build electricity plants. The nation is
looking to alternatives to coal-fired power stations after a
spate of blackouts closed mines in the country in early 2008.  Eskom, which generates about 45 percent of the electricity
used in Africa, currently produces about 43,000 megawatts.  A third of the applications were for wind power projects,
making up 70 percent of the proposed capacity, and about a third
for solar, with 15 percent of the output, Aphane said. “Should
Eskom not be able to make payments, we would do that.”  Eskom was granted a $3.75 billion World Bank loan in April
for its expansion plans on condition the company introduces
renewable energy projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
