De La Rue Plc , the world’s biggest
printer of banknotes, said it received an approach from a suitor
that could lead to a takeover offer.  “There is no certainty that this highly preliminary
approach will lead to an offer,” the company said in a
statement today. The approach is “opportunistic” in nature, it
said.  De La Rue  rose  as much as 199 pence, or 31 percent, to
846.5 pence, its largest gain since at least 1995, and traded at
800 pence at 9:10 a.m. in London, valuing the company at 792
million pounds ($1.24 billion).  The Basingstoke, England-based company received an offer
from France’s Oberthur Technologies SA, Sky News reported
yesterday, without saying where it got the information.  De La Rue, a 200-year-old company, produces currencies for
more than 150 nations as well as security documents including
passports and fiscal stamps, according to its  website . Oberthur
is the third-largest private producer of banknotes, according to
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
