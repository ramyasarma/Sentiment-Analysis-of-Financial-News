Ford Motor Co ., the second-largest
U.S. automaker, is delaying the shipment of some of its 2011
F-150 pickups because of a parts shortage.  The shortage affects a “small population” of trucks and
will be resolved “soon,”  Anne Marie Gattari , a Ford
spokeswoman, said today in an interview, without being more
specific. Most of the thousands of 2011 F-150 pickups Ford has
stockpiled in parking lots around the Detroit area still will be
shipped as the new model is introduced nationwide, she said.  Ford has equipped the 2011 version of the F-150, its top-
selling vehicle, with more fuel-efficient engines to boost sales
to buyers seeking to avoid higher gas costs. Ford sold 473,461
F-series trucks this year through November, a 30 percent gain
from the same period in 2009, according to Autodata Corp.  “Any vehicle that is hot is important to Ford, and it’s
doubly bad in the case of the F-150 because it’s such a volume
product,” said Jim Hall, principal at automotive researcher
2953 Analytics in Birmingham, Michigan. “It’s a negative for
Ford because of the lost revenue and the lost volume. It’s one
of the most profitable vehicles in their range.”  Ford fell 15 cents to $16.65 at 4:15 p.m. in composite
 trading  on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen 67
percent this this year.  “A certain population of trucks is being held due to
limited part availability,” Gattari said, declining to identify
the part or the number of trucks being held back from delivery.
“We’re awaiting that part so we can ship this small population
of trucks.”  Fuel Economy  The F-series pickups have been the top-selling trucks in
the U.S. for 33 years, according to Ford. After customers
complained about fuel economy, Ford added a 3.7-liter V6 engine
to the 2011 F-150 that gets 23 miles per gallon on the highway
and 16 mpg in city driving, the automaker said. Ford also is
offering new 5.0-liter and 6.2-liter V8 engines on the 2011
model. Next year, Ford will add a turbo-charged, direct-injected
V6 engine to the lineup.  Ford needs to protect its improving quality reputation and
not release the new F-150 with any flaws, Hall said.  “They’re far better off not trying to put a sub-par
vehicle out there,” Hall said. “Then you end up with a problem
that’s too expensive to fix down the road.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
