Yale University’s  men’s hockey team 
is ranked No. 1 for the first time in school history today after
victories over No. 13 Union College and No. 15 Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute this past weekend.  The  USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll  ranked the Bulldogs
(10-1) ahead of the University of Minnesota Duluth (12-2-2), the
University of New Hampshire (9-2-4) and Boston College (11-5).  Yale is the first East Coast Athletic Association team to
be ranked No. 1 since Cornell University entered the 2003
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament as the top
seed. The Bulldogs have been ranked fifth or better since the
season began and have the nation’s longest active win streak at
five games.  Yale is off to its best start since the 1929-30 season when
the team went 16-0 in route to a 17-1-1 finish. The team hosts
the University of Vermont in New Haven, Connecticut, on Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
