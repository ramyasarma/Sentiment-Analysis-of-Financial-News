Kenya’s shilling weakened for the
first day in three against the dollar as the U.S. currency
“recovered” on international markets, said  Bethuel Karanja , head
of trading at CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.1 percent to 80.45 per dollar, where it was trading
at 1:08 p.m. in Nairobi. The shilling closed at 80.35 on Dec. 3.  “After the payroll numbers were released it made the dollar
weaker across the board, but it is starting to recover a bit,”
Karanja said in a phone interview today.  The dollar advanced against 13 of its 16 major counterparts
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said a return to
a recession in the U.S. “doesn’t seem likely.” The U.S. currency
snapped a three-day decline against the euro, appreciating as
much as 0.9 percent to 1.3292 per euro. It closed at 1.3414 in
New York on Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
