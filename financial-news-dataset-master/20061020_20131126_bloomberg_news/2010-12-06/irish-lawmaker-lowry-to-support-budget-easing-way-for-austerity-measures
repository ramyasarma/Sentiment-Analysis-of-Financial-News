Michael Lowry , an independent Irish
lawmaker, said he’ll support the government’s budget for next
year, paving the way for austerity measures to pass through
parliament tomorrow.  Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  has the support of 82 lawmakers,
including Lowry and fellow independent Jackie Healy-Rae,
compared with 80 for the opposition. Healy-Rae will also back
the measures, broadcaster  RTE  said today, without citing anyone.  “Our country is in grave economic danger,” Lowry said in
an e-mailed statement today. “The consequences of not passing a
budget would be disastrous for Ireland and its people.”  The government will lay out details tomorrow of 6 billion
euros ($7.9 billion) of spending cuts and tax increases. Ireland
won’t be able to draw down a 67-billion euro aid package from
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund unless
the budget is passed, according to a copy of the agreement
published last week. The government is also planning to add 17.5
billion on its own resources to the bailout.  Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  will present the 2011 budget
in a speech in Dublin at 3:45 p.m. in Dublin tomorrow, with
voting due to begin at about 7 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
