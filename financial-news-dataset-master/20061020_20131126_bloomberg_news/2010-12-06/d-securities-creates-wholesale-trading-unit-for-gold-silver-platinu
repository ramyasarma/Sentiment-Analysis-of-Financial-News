TD Securities , the investment-banking
unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank, created a precious metals
business to trade in the gold, silver, platinum and palladium
markets.  The division has five employees in Toronto, three in London
and two in Singapore, and will make a “couple” of additional
hires by the end of the first quarter, said  Tim Gardiner ,
managing director, global precious metals.  TD Securities has been building its commodities operations
globally, adding investment bankers and equity analysts,
Gardiner said. In October, the bank increased its international
fixed-income operation in London.  “We’re going to use this as a platform for further
commodity trading,” Gardiner, 49, said in a telephone interview
today from Toronto. “I would like to us to, within the next
couple of years, be in a position that we can be accepted as
market-makers” in the London Bullion Market Association.  Canada’s second-largest bank by assets reported last week
that profit at its wholesale banking unit fell 74 percent to
C$95 million ($94.4 million) because of lower fixed-income,
credit and equity trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
