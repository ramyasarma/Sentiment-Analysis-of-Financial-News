KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, expects smartphones to revive profit
growth at the main wireless business in about two years,
President  Takashi Tanaka  said.  Profit growth will begin accelerating in the year ending
March 2013, Tanaka, 53, who took over as president this month,
said in an interview in Tokyo today. The company also plans a
3G smartphone that can also pick up Wimax signals next fiscal
year, he said.  Profit at in the mobile-phone business will probably fall
11 percent to 430 billion yen ($5.2 billion) in the fiscal year
ending March 31, as revenue declines 4 percent to 2.55 trillion
yen, the company said in October. KDDI also lags behind  NTT
DoCoMo Inc. , Japan’s largest mobile-phone operator, and  Softbank
Corp.  in net user additions.  KDDI fell 1.2 percent to 478,000 yen at the close of
trading in Tokyo today, a second consecutive day of decline. The
shares have tumbled 3 percent this year in line with the 3.6
percent drop of the Nikkei 225 average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
