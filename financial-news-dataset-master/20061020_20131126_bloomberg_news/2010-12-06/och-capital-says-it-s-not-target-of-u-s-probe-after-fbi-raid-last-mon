Loch Capital Management LLC, one of
three hedge funds raided by the FBI last month, said that it
received a subpoena and the firm’s management isn’t the target
of a government probe.  The search appears to be a broader investigation by the
U.S. of the financial-services industry and the use of
“professional networks,” the Boston-based firm said in a Dec.
3 letter to clients.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office confirmed that Timothy McSweeney
or Todd McSweeney aren’t the focus of the investigation, Loch
Capital said. The twin brothers run the fund.  The firm said it has stopped using expert networks, which
sell research and provide access to industry consultants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
