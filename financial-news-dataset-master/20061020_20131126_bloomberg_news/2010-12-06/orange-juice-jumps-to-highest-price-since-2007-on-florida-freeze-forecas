Orange-juice futures rose to the
highest since May 2007 on concern that freezing weather may harm
groves in Florida, the world’s second-biggest grower.  Temperatures in parts of central Florida, the state’s
largest growing region, may fall to 29 degrees Fahrenheit (minus
2 Celsius) tomorrow morning, said  David Salmon , a meteorologist
at Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri. Temperatures would
need to touch 25 degrees to “start doing some damage to the
fruit,” he said. Orange-juice prices jumped 10 percent in four
sessions.  “It’s all weather-related concerns,” said  Jodi Timmons , a
vice president at Global Commodity Futures LLC in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. “We have some pretty cold temperatures
forecast for the later part of this week.”  Orange juice for January delivery rose 7.65 cents, or 4.9
percent, to settle at $1.6445 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, the biggest gain since Oct. 15. Earlier, the
price reached $1.667, the highest since May 21, 2007.  The commodity has advanced 27 percent this year as adverse
weather threatened global supplies. Brazil is the biggest
grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
