WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
opened an account with Switzerland’s PostFinance in Geneva,
 Tribune de Geneve  said, citing Marc Andrey, a spokesman for the
banking unit of the Swiss Post.  An account would require an address in the Swiss canton,
the newspaper said. PostFinance is verifying the information
Assange gave to set up the account, because it investigates if
it has any doubts about clients’ home addresses, Andrey told the
newspaper.  Assange mentioned the account on the Internet, so it’s no
longer confidential, Andrey said, according to Tribune de
Geneve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
