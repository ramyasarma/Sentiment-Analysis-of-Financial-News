Deutsche Lufthansa AG  said an Airbus
SAS plane carrying 66 passengers returned to Tbilisi, Georgia,
today after instruments indicated a drop in cabin pressure.  The single-aisle A319 aircraft, which was headed for
Munich, landed safely after 45 minutes in the air, spokesman
 Thomas Jachnow  said in a phone interview. Oxygen masks weren’t
released, though the jet had reached cruising altitude, he said.  Georgia’s Foreign Minister  Grigol Vashadze  was booked on
the flight, his deputy  Nino Kalandadze  told reporters in the
Georgian capital. Travelers were rebooked with other airlines
and Cologne, Germany-based Lufthansa sent a technician to
Tbilisi to ascertain the source of the problem.  Jachnow said it wasn’t immediately apparent whether the
incident was caused by an actual air-pressure drop or an
instrument malfunction. A pressure failure would ordinarily
trigger the automatic deployment of masks.  Five people aboard a Boeing Co. 737 operated by Lufthansa
suffered light injuries when cabin-pressure problems triggered a
priority landing on Oct. 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
