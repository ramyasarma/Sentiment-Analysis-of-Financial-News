Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gold company, is seeking to boost output in West Africa
to at least double production at its Bonikro mine in Ivory Coast.  “Ideally, and this is not written in stone, if we’re going
to have a presence in Africa, we’d be looking for something
bigger,”  Geoff Day , chief operating officer-offshore for the
Melbourne-based company, told reporters today at a conference in
Sydney. “You’d have to think it would be in the order of
300,000-500,000 ounces. That would be something where you can
say you can support a country presence.”  Bonikro, which Newcrest acquired through its A$11.4 billion
($11.3 billion) takeover of  Lihir  Gold Ltd. this year, produced
150,023 ounces of gold in 2009. Gold is headed for a 10th annual
gain, spurring companies to raise output and buy rivals.  West Africa is the “right real estate” historically for
high levels of gold production, Day said. “It’s great ground,
there’s every chance it’ll be that. If it’s not, we’re not going
to be philosophically wedded to it.”  Newcrest rose 1 percent to A$41.50 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney
time close on the Australian stock exchange.  Newcrest’s total gold  output  will reach 3.75 million ounces
in fiscal 2014, Day said during a presentation. It will rise 8.2
percent annually from existing mines and projects, he said.
Newcrest operates mines in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia as
well as in Australia and Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
