Gold futures jumped to a record
$1,429.40 an ounce on concern the U.S. will pump more cash into
the economy and Europe’s debt woes will spread, boosting the
appeal of the metal as an alternative to currencies.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central
bank may boost Treasury purchases. European officials were split
on containing the sovereign-debt crisis. Gold priced in euros
and U.K. pounds also rose to records, and silver futures
extended a rally to a 30-year high.  “Fundamentals are very much bullish for gold,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at Futurepath Trading in Chicago. “The
continuing European debt crisis is on traders’ mind, and that
creates the flight-to-safety quality in gold.”  Gold futures for February delivery reached the all-time
high in after-hours trading after closing up $9.90, or 0.7
percent, to $1,416.10 at 2:14 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
previous intraday record was $1,424.30 on Nov. 9. The metal was
up $18.30, or 1.3 percent, to $1,424.50 at 4:43 p.m., compared
with the settlement on Dec. 3.  Gold for immediately delivery climbed $9.43, or 0.7
percent, to $1,423.50. Earlier, the metal reached a record
$1,427.55.  The metal is in “an unchartered territory” after breaking
the record, Lesh said. Prices may reach $1,456 or higher by the
end of the year, he said.  ‘Currency Debasement’  “Further currency debasement is the new norm,” said
 Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago, said before the close of the Comex. “As long as that
stands, investors are going to buy metals as a hedge against
paper money. Gold has clear sailing to go much further from
here.”  Unemployment may take five years to fall to a normal level,
and Fed buying of Treasury securities beyond the $600 billion
announced last month is possible, Bernanke said in an interview
broadcast yesterday by  CBS  Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program.  Germany rejected calls to increase the European Union’s 750
billion-euro ($1 trillion) aid fund or introduce joint bond
sales, signaling refusal to bear more costs to stamp out the
debt crisis.  Gold is poised for a 10th annual gain after governments
spent trillions of dollars and kept interest rates low to
bolster economies.  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, has recommended owning gold in
foreign currencies to limit exposure to a rally by the dollar.
The greenback rose as much as 1.3 percent today against the
euro.  ‘Reservable Currency’  “Owning gold in this fashion relieves us of exposure to
the dollar,” Gartman said. “It takes gold away from being a
bet against the dollar and to being a bet for gold as a
reservable currency.”  Gold probably will advance to $1,500 next year on demand
from investors and central banks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a report dated Dec. 3.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 46.4 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $29.735 an ounce. In after-hours trading,
the price reached $30.355, extending a rally to the highest
since 1980.  To contact the reporters on this story:
