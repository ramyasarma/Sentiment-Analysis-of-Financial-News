Most Japanese  stocks  rose, led by
commodity-related companies, as oil and metal prices gained and
on speculation the U.S. will expand measures to support the
economy. Exporters fell as the dollar traded near a three-week
low against the yen, damping the outlook for overseas earnings.  Mitsui & Co., which counts commodities as its largest
source of profit, climbed 1.5 percent. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,
Japan’s largest gold producer, advanced 3.4 percent.  Canon Inc. ,
which is the world’s biggest camera maker and gets more than 80
percent of its sales abroad, fell 1 percent. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed may buy more Treasury
securities, according to an interview with CBS television.  “The message that the U.S. will continue its easing policy
until the economy recovers is leading to speculation that excess
liquidity will continue to support the market,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. “Commodities markets are doing well because of
the speculation, and that’s supporting the stock market.”  Four stocks advanced for each that declined among the 1,664
companies in the  Topix  index, which gained 0.3 percent to 881.41
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average fell 0.1 percent to 10,167.23, and moved between today’s
high and low in the narrowest range since last Dec. 21.  The number of Topix-listed shares that traded was 1.48
billion, the lowest level since Oct. 25.  Valuations, Commodities  The Nikkei 225 rose 8 percent last month, the fastest pace
among indexes for the world’s 45 largest equity markets, as the
dollar strengthened from a 15-year low against the yen. The Fed
expanded record measures last month to support the world’s
biggest economy, offsetting concern that Europe’s government-
debt crisis and China’s steps to curb property-price inflation
will slow global growth.  Stocks in the Nikkei trade at 17.8 times  estimated earnings 
on average, less than half the level of 43.5 times at the start
of the year.  Mitsui advanced 1.5 percent to 1,361 yen. Sumitomo Metal
Mining jumped 3.4 percent to 1,370 yen, the second-largest gain
in the Nikkei 225. Marubeni Corp., Japan’s fourth-biggest
trading company by revenue, increased 0.7 percent to 573 yen.  Crude oil for January delivery jumped 1.4 percent in New
York on Dec. 3 to $89.19 a barrel, the highest settlement since
Oct. 7, 2008, as the dollar tumbled and boosted the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment. Copper rose 0.5
percent on Dec. 3, while gold futures advanced 1.2 percent.  Shipping Lines Advance  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
increased 1.1 percent to 377 yen, the highest close since April
30. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the second-largest, climbed 1.2
percent to 587 yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the No. 3,
gained 1.1 percent to 357 yen.  The Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for commodities rose
1.6 percent on Dec. 3 to its highest level in a week.  Bernanke said Fed purchases of Treasury securities beyond
the $600 billion announced last month are possible and that U.S.
unemployment may take five years to fall to a rate of about 5
percent to 6 percent, according to an interview with CBS’s “60
Minutes” program that aired in the U.S. on Sunday night.  “Risk assets are moving into commodities,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The
dollar’s weakness against the yen on the backdrop of a slow U.S.
jobs recovery will weigh on some of the Japanese exporters.”  Dollar Hurts Exporters  Canon declined 1 percent to 4,070 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-largest carmaker by sales, retreated 0.6 percent
to 3,135 yen. Panasonic Corp., an electronics maker that gets
more than 40 percent of its sales outside Japan, dropped 1.2
percent to 1,191 yen. They were the  heaviest drags  on the Topix.  The dollar tumbled on Dec. 3 after U.S. Labor Department
figures showed payrolls increased by 39,000 last month, less
than the most pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Unemployment held near a 26-year high.  The dollar traded as low as 82.57 yen today in Tokyo, near
its lowest level in three weeks. A weaker dollar reduces the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  NGK Insulators Ltd., a maker of electrical insulators and
industrial ceramics, jumped 5 percent to 1,348 yen, today’s
 steepest gain  in the Nikkei 225 and the gauge’s biggest support.
Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its investment rating on the
shares to “outperform” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
