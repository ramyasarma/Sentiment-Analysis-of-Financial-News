Washington  Governor  Christine Gregoire  intends to call a special legislative session before
Christmas to deal with a $1.1 billion projected budget deficit
for the current fiscal period, according to a spokeswoman.  Gregoire, a Democrat, announced her plans today after a
meeting with legislative leaders, Karina Shagren, the
spokeswoman, said by telephone. She’ll meet them again Dec. 9,
Shagren said. The latest gap is forecast for the two-year cycle
that ends in June.  “She’s already used across-the-board cuts and basically
has exhausted that option, so the only other option then is for
the Legislature to take action,” Shagren said.  Home to  Microsoft Corp. , the world’s biggest software
maker, the state doesn’t tax personal wages. On Nov. 2, voters
rejected a proposed income tax on the wealthiest residents and
repealed a sales levy on candy, soft drinks and bottled water.
The votes, coupled with a sluggish economy, led to projections
that state revenue would miss forecasts by $1.2 billion through
June 2013.  Gregoire in September ordered a 6.3 percent reduction in
state spending to cope with projected deficits. At that time,
the gap for the budget through June 2011 was forecast at $520
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
