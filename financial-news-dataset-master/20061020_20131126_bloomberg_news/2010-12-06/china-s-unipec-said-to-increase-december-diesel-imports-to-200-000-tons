China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Co., the nation’s largest oil trader, will import
200,000 metric tons of diesel in December, 67 percent more than
it initially planned last month, a company official said.  China International, or Unipec, originally intended to
bring in 120,000 tons to ease a domestic shortage of the
transport fuel, according to the official, who declined to be
identified because of company policy.  Unipec, the trading unit of  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. , bought 80,000 tons of diesel in November, a company
official said Nov. 18.  Unipec will halt diesel exports this month after reducing
exports of the fuel to 10,000 tons last month from 90,000 tons
in October and 120,000 tons in September, according to the
official.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Clyde Russell ,  Amit Prakash .  To contact the reporter on this story:
