Corridor Resources Inc.  fell the most
in more than nine years after reporting “perplexing” results
from a natural-gas shale formation in New Brunswick, Canada.  The company got “negligible” gas or none at all from two
wells in the Elgin area, according to a statement today.
Considering gas flows from nearby wells and from earlier
drilling, “the preliminary responses of these wells are both
unexpected and perplexing,” Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Corridor
said.  Corridor fell C$2.57, or 33 percent, to C$5.19 at 4 p.m. on
the Toronto Stock Exchange. It was the biggest decline since
March 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
