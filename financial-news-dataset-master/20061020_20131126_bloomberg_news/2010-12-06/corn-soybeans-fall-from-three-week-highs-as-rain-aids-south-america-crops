Corn and soybean futures fell from
three-week highs as rain may boost prospects for newly planted
crops in Brazil and Argentina, the biggest exporters after the
U.S.  As much as 75 percent of the growing regions in Brazil
received 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) of rain in the past three
days, the Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report. About 20
percent of crops in Argentina received as much as 2 inches over
the weekend. More showers are expected in the next week, the
private forecaster said.  “There was a little more rain in South America than
expected,” said  Jerry Gidel , a grain analyst for North American
Risk Management Services Inc. in Chicago. “Brazil is in great
shape, but Argentina will need more rain than is forecast this
week to eliminate concerns about dry soils.”  Corn futures for March delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $5.68 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after gaining 3.7 percent last week. Earlier,
the price touched $5.7525, the highest since Nov. 15. On Nov. 9,
corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said adverse weather reduced the size of the U.S.
crop.  Soybeans for January delivery declined 11.75 cents or 0.9
percent, to close at $12.885 a bushel on the CBOT, after
touching $13.0675, the highest since Nov. 15. The most-active
futures rose 5 percent last week. The price reached a 26-month
high of $13.485 on Nov. 12 on increased Chinese demand.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
