France and India signed a preliminary
contract for nuclear reactors and services worth about 7 billion
euros ($9.3 billion),  Areva SA  Chief Executive Officer  Anne Lauvergeon  told reporters in New Delhi today.  Areva and state-owned  Nuclear Power Corp. of India  Ltd.
signed agreements for the construction of two reactors, the
first of a series of six at Jaitapur in western India, the
French nuclear company said in a statement today. The deals
include fuel supply for 25 years, the Paris-based company said.  The agreements set conditions for Areva to supply “nuclear
islands,” which include reactor vessels and steam generators, as
well as related services, and allow both sides “to accelerate
several partnerships between Areva and the Indian nuclear
industry,” the French company said. Areva, the world’s biggest
supplier of nuclear equipment and services, will supply EPR
reactors, it said.  The French government, which controls 91 percent of Areva,
is seeking to sell shares to investors such as the Kuwait
sovereign fund. Areva, which wants to increase sales in
countries such as India and China, needs to invest in new plants
and uranium mines as competition from Russian and Korean
companies intensifies.  “The capital increase is necessary, but not vital,”
Lauvergeon told France 24 television station today. “It’s been
now 18 months of talks, and it does not help commercial deals
like the one here today.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
