England bowler Stuart Broad was ruled
out of the remainder of the Ashes cricket series against
Australia because of a torn abdominal muscle, the England and
Wales Cricket Board said.  Broad, who sustained the injury yesterday during the second
Test in Adelaide, will also miss the one-day series between the
teams, the ECB said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
