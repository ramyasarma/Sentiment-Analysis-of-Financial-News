What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange after rain damaged crops in
Australia, boosting demand for U.S. exports, said  Jim Gerlach ,
the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
the CBOT as falling inventories of palm oil and adverse weather
in South America reduce prospects for global supplies, Gerlach
said. Soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $1.50 lower per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up 0.3 cent to 0.4
cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on concern that demand for grain-based ethanol
will decline, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
