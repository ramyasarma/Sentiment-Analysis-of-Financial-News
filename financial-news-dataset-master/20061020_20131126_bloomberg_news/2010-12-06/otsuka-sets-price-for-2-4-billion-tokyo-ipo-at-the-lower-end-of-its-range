Japan’s  Otsuka Holdings Inc. ,
preparing for the world’s biggest healthcare initial public
offering since at least 2006, priced shares at the lower end of
its range to entice investors.  The Tokyo-based drugmaker set a price of 2,100 yen a share,
compared with an indicated range of 2,000 yen to 2,400 yen, it
said in a statement today. At that price, the sale would raise
198 billion yen ($2.4 billion) including overallotment.  Chief Executive Officer  Tatsuo Higuchi  said Nov. 26 he will
use proceeds from the IPO to buy drug and health-food
businesses, according to two people briefed on the plan.
Investors considered the fair value of the shares to be 2,400
yen, said  Makoto Kikuchi , chief executive officer at Myojo Asset
Management Japan Co., a Tokyo-based hedge fund advisory firm.  “They thought they wouldn’t be able to book a gain unless
they bought at the lower end,” Kikuchi said.  The discoverer of the Abilify schizophrenia treatment sold
by  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  in the U.S. would have a market 
capitalization of about 1.17 trillion yen based on its
outstanding stock after the IPO. That would rank Otsuka as
Japan’s fourth-largest drugmaker by value, trailing Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co., Astellas Pharma Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Co.
The company said Nov. 12 it planned to sell 94.5 million shares
including overallotment.  Stock Exchange Listing  A listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is scheduled for Dec.
15.  Morgan Stanley ,  UBS AG  and  Nomura Holdings Inc.  are managing
the share sale.  The drugmaker set a price range of 2,000 yen to 2,400 yen a
share on Nov. 25. In its prospectus on Nov. 12, Otsuka gave an
indicative price of 2,400 yen.  Otsuka has no comment on pricing, spokeswoman Yukie Shibata
said by telephone today.  Net income at Otsuka climbed 43 percent to 67.4 billion yen
in the year ended March. Sales increased 13 percent to 1.08
trillion yen, of which 45 percent came from outside Japan.  Global sales of Abilify  rose  31 percent to $4.67 billion
yen last year, according to IMS Health Inc., a market research
firm in Norwalk, Connecticut. Otsuka gets royalties from
Bristol-Myers linked to the sales.  Otsuka, which derives two-thirds of sales from
pharmaceuticals, also makes Pocari Sweat drinks and Soyjoy
nutrition bars. The company’s assets include the  Ridge Vineyard 
in California and a  ceramic art museum  in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
