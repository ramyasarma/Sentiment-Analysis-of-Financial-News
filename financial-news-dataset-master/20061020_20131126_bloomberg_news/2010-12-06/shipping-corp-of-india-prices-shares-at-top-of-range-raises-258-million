Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. , the
nation’s largest sea-cargo carrier, will sell shares at the top
of its price range in its public offering, raising 11.6 billion
rupees ($258 million).  Shipping Corp. will sell the shares at 140 rupees apiece,
the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange
today. Investors bid for about 408.6 million shares, or 4.83
times the 84.6 million stock on offer, according to data posted
on the National Stock Exchange website on Dec 3.  The sale is part of Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s bid to
raise 400 billion rupees from asset sales this fiscal year to
help fund construction of roads, ports and hospitals. Shipping
Corp. will use the proceeds to purchase vessels, according to
the offer document.  SBI Capital Markets Ltd., IDFC Capital Ltd. and ICICI
Securities Ltd. were the advisers for the share sale, which
opened Nov. 30.  The freight carrier plans to spend 26.6 billion rupees on
nine vessels, according to the document. Shipping Corp.  shares 
fell 0.5 percent to 144.5 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of
trading in Mumbai, where the company is based.  MOIL Ltd., India’s largest producer of manganese ore,
earlier this week drew at least 640 billion rupees of bids in
its initial public offering as investors placed orders for 56
times the shares offered. State-owned  Coal India Ltd. ’s IPO in
October received demand for 15 times the shares available.  Shipping Corp. is selling new shares, while the government
is offering part of its stake in the sale. The company planned
to sell stock at 135 rupees to 140 rupees apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
