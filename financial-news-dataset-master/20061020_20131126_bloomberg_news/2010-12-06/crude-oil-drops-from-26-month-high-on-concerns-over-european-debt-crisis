Oil declined from the highest in 26
months in New York as traders sold contracts to secure profits
after priced surged 6.5 percent last week.  Futures dropped as much as 0.7 percent, the first decline
in five days, on concern European officials may fail to agree on
ways to contain a regional debt crisis that poses a threat to
growth. Hungary’s sovereign credit rating was reduced by Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday. U.S. oil supplies probably fell for
the first time in three weeks on increased demand from refiners,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “Oil is taking a breather given that we’re at pretty high
levels after putting on about 6 percent last week,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “It could be a bit of profit-taking.
There wasn’t a lot of data overnight, although Moody’s has
downgraded Hungary.”  The contract for January delivery fell as much as 58 cents
to $88.80 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was at $89.18 at 2:56 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, prices rose to $89.38, the highest settlement
since Oct. 7, 2008.  Oil climbed yesterday amid speculation the U.S. may extend
stimulus measures and on cold-weather forecasts for the U.S. and
Europe. That pushed prices 6.3 percent higher since Nov. 30, the
biggest four-day rally since Aug. 3.  Brent crude for January settlement lost as much as 54
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $90.91 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday, it gained 3 cents to
$91.45.  U.S. Supplies  Oil failed to breach long-term chart resistance at $89.84 a
barrel, the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop to
$32.40 in December 2008 from a record high of $147.27 in July
that year. Futures, up 78 percent in 2009, have gained 12.5
percent this year.  Crude  inventories fell 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4 percent,
in the seven days ended Dec. 3 from 359.7 million a week
earlier, based on the median estimate from eight analysts before
an Energy Department report tomorrow.  Gasoline  supplies are expected to have risen 875,000
barrels, or 0.4 percent, from 210.2 million, the survey showed.
It would be the third weekly gain, the longest sequence of
increases since August. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, probably
decreased 550,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, from 158.1 million.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Gasoline Falls  Gasoline futures fell for a third day as Irving Oil Corp.
and Valero Energy Corp. returned refinery units to service,
ramping up production of the fuel.  Gasoline for January delivery dropped as much as 1.17
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.33 a gallon in New York. Yesterday,
the contract fell 1.04 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at
$2.3417.  Irving completed maintenance on a residual fluid catalytic
cracker at its Saint John refinery in New Brunswick, Lesley
Dickson, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday in an e-mail. The
plant exports about 175,000 barrels a day of products to the
northeastern U.S., including New York Harbor, the delivery point
for Nymex gasoline and heating oil contracts.  Valero started a fluid catalytic cracker at its Memphis,
Tennessee, refinery over the weekend, according to company
spokesman  Bill Day .  To contact the reporters on this story:
