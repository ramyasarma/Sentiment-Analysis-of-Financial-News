Samsung Electronics Co.  won a judge’s
dismissal of one of several claims that it infringed  Advanced
Micro Devices Inc.  patents related to making memory chips.  U.S. District Judge  Susan Illston  in San Francisco ruled
today that Samsung didn’t infringe patent 5,559,990, related to
improving computer memory performance.  South Korea’s Samsung was accused in a 2008 complaint of
making chips that incorporated inventions protected by seven AMD
patents. The dispute is over dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM; static random access memory, or SRAM; and NAND-flash
memory chips.  Michael Silverman , a spokesman for Sunnyvale, California-
based AMD, said the company is reviewing today’s court order.  “The ‘990 patent is one of several patents involved in the
lawsuit, and the judge’s order does not impact AMD’s claims with
respect to any of the remaining patents,” he said in an e-mail.  The case is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. Samsung
Electronics Co., 3:08-cv-986, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
