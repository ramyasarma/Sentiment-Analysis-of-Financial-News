Cotton futures fell on signs that
demand is slowing from China, the world’s biggest consumer,
after prices posted their biggest weekly rally in 39 years.
Orange-juice futures rose to a three-year high.  U.S. export sales of upland cotton to China fell to 193,179
bales in the week ended Nov. 25, down 23 percent from the
average during the previous four weeks, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said on Dec. 2. Total U.S.  exports  dropped 26
percent from the average. Before today, futures in New York
declined 13 percent from a record on Nov. 10.  “It could be a little bit of pushback on these prices
overseas,” said  Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant
at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. “For sure
there has been some pushback” with fewer imports by China,
Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey, he said.  Cotton for March delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.8 percent, to
$1.3134 a pound at 10:01 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, prices declined as much as 3.3 percent.  Last week, the most-active contract jumped 18 percent, the
biggest weekly gain since July 9, 1971. Cotton rose to a record
$1.5195 on Nov. 10, and then plunged 12 percent over the next
two days.  “The market was getting ahead of itself,” Ryan said.
Still, prices are up 72 percent this year and should remain
“relatively strong” this week, he said.  Cotton use in China is forecast to fall to 47 million bales
in the year ending July 31, down 6 percent from last season, the
USDA  said  on Nov. 9. The agency will update its projections on
Dec. 10. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  U.S.  inventories  held in warehouses monitored by ICE have
increased 12-fold from a 2010 low of 8,910 bales in October. As
of Dec. 3, stockpiles totaled 106,606 bales, down 74 percent
this year.  Orange-juice futures gained for the fourth straight session
as cold weather threatened citrus groves in Florida, the world’s
biggest orange producer after Brazil.  “Mother Nature is reminding us that, yes, it can get cold
and we can have damage,” said  Sterling Smith , an analyst at
Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota. “That’s increasing
some risk premium,” he said.  Orange juice for January delivery rose 9.7 cents, or 6.2
cents, to $1.665 a pound in New York. Earlier, the price rose as
much as 6.3 percent to $1.667, the highest since May 2007.  Last week, seven analysts estimated that prices may reach
$1.646 by the end of the year on increased risk of frost damage.
In 2009, orange juice advanced 8.2 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
