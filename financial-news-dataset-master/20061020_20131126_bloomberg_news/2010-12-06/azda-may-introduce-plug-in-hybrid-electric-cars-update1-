Mazda Motor Corp. ’s Chief Executive
Officer  Takashi Yamanouchi  said the automaker is considering
introducing plug-in hybrid and electric cars after it releases a
gasoline-electric hybrid model.  Mazda would follow Nissan Motor Co., whose battery-powered
Leaf goes on sale this month, as well as Toyota Motor Corp. and
 Honda Motor Co.  electric cars and plug-ins planned for 2012.
Carmakers are adding less-polluting vehicles as governments
tighten emissions rules and consumers demand more fuel-efficient
models.  Mazda has said it will start selling a hybrid model by 2013
using Toyota’s technology.  Shares in the Hiroshima, western Japan-based  automaker  rose
0.4 percent to 239 yen in Tokyo trading as of 2:14 p.m. The
stock has risen 13 percent in 2010.  Separately, Yamanouchi, speaking to reporters today in
Tokyo, said Mazda plans to increase annual Japan production to
about 1.05 million units by the year ending March 2016 from
about 900,000 units currently. The proportion of exports will
rise to 85 percent from 80 percent, he said.  Even as the strong yen cuts the value of repatriated export
earnings, “our strategy is to use our existing capacity
efficiently,” Yamanouchi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
