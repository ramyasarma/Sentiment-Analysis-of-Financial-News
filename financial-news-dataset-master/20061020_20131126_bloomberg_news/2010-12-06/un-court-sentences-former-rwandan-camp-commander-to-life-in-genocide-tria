A United Nations court trying
suspects in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide sentenced a former Rwandan
army lieutenant to life imprisonment after he was convicted of
genocide and crimes against humanity.  Idelphonse Hategekimana was acquitted on one count of
complicity in genocide, the Arusha, Tanzania-based  International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  said in an emailed statement today.  Hategekimana, the former commander of the Ngoma military
camp, was found guilty of murdering Tutsis at several locations,
including a church, and on charges of raping a woman, according
to the statement.  He was transferred to the UN Detention Facility in Arusha
on Feb. 19, 2003, following his arrest in the Republic of Congo
three days earlier, the statement said.  About 800,000 people, more than 10 percent of Rwanda’s
population, died in the 100-day slaughter of ethnic Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by Hutu militias and government officials in the
genocide. The massacre followed the assassination of Rwandan
President  Juvenal Habyarimana , whose plane was shot down as it
prepared to land in the capital, Kigali, on April 6, 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
