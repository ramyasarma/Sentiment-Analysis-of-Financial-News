Treasuries rose, sending 10-year note
yields below 3 percent, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may boost purchases of U.S. debt.
The euro weakened and gold reached a record amid divisions over
steps to halt the debt crisis, while U.S. stocks retreated.  Ten-year note yields slid eight basis points to 2.93
percent at 4 p.m. in New York, snapping a three-day rise. The
Dollar Index gained 0.3 percent to 79.640 and the euro slid
against 14 of 16 major peers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
lost 0.1 percent to 1,223.12. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities
rose to the highest since October 2008 as gold closed at a
record, silver reached a 30-year high and oil settled at the
highest price in 26 months.  Ten-year Treasury yields slid from an almost four-month
high after Bernanke said on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program
yesterday that U.S. unemployment may take five years to fall to
a normal level and Fed purchases of government debt beyond the
$600 billion announced are “possible.” Germany rejected calls
to increase the European Union’s 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion)
aid fund or introduce joint bond sales, signaling its refusal to
bear extra costs to stamp out the debt crisis.  Bernanke’s comments show “things might be not as good as
they seem,” said  Stanley Nabi , New York-based vice chairman of
Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which oversees more than $9
billion. “Look at our fiscal situation, look at Europe. Now if
you want to build a positive case, you can do it as well because
there are also positive signs in the economy. You need to take a
balanced view at this point.”  Positive Reports  An Institute for Supply Management report showed last week
that U.S. manufacturing expanded for a 16th month in November.

to 0.43 percent. The  Dollar Index , which measures the greenback
against six of its most-traded peers, rebounded after falling to

two-week high of $1.3442. Hungary’s forint sank 0.7 percent
against the euro after Moody’s downgraded the country’s debt to
the lowest investment grade and indicated it may cut the rating
to junk. The BUX index of stocks lost 0.7 percent.  Spain, Italy  Spanish and Italian government bonds fell, while  German
bunds  were little changed. The Spanish 10-year yield added 13

that unrest may delay exports from Ivory Coast, the world’s

British thermal units, the highest price in four months, after

boosting demand for the heating fuel.  Gold futures closed at a record $1,416.10 an ounce, up 0.7
percent.  Silver futures for March delivery topped $30 an ounce on
