Pat Gillick , a baseball executive who
helped build three World Series champions, was voted into the
sport’s Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Former New York
Yankees owner  George Steinbrenner  fell short.  Gillick, 73, received 13 votes from the 16-member panel,
one more than needed for induction.  Marvin Miller , who led the
baseball players’ union through the transition to free agency in
the 1970s and ‘80s, was one vote shy, with 11. Gillick won two
World Series with the Toronto Blue Jays and one with the
Philadelphia Phillies.  Dave Concepcion, an infielder on World Series championship
teams with the Cincinnati Reds of the 1970s, was third with
eight votes.  Among those receiving an unspecified fewer than eight
votes, according to the hall’s  website , were Steinbrenner, who
died in July, and the man he hired and fired five times as
manager,  Billy Martin .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
