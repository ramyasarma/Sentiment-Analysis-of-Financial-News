Pioneer Food Group Ltd. , a South
African food company, said full-year profit dropped 58 percent
after it paid a record penalty for anti-competitive behavior in
its bread, milling, poultry and egg units.  Net income fell to 234.5 million rand ($31.4 million) in
the 12 months through September, from 560.5 million rand a year
earlier, the Paarl-based company said in a stock-exchange
statement today. Sales dropped 3 percent to 15.7 billion rand.  Pioneer, which produces Weet-Bix cereal and Heinz Tomato
Ketchup, earlier this year settled antitrust penalties worth
1.05 billion rand for price-fixing in flour and corn processing,
and collusion in flour, bread and corn prices.  Annual profit was “substantially impacted by the settlement
we reached with the Competition Commission,” the company said in
the statement. “A largely sustained earnings performance is
expected in the current financial year based on current growth
momentum,” it said, without providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
