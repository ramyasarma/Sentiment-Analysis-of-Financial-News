Liberty Global Inc.,  the cable
company controlled by billionaire  John Malone , said it agreed to
buy Polish cable television operator Aster Sp. z o.o.  Liberty, which already owns Aster’s Polish rival UPC Polska
Sp. z o.o., will purchase the cable TV business from Mid Europa
Partners LLP for about 2.4 billion zloty ($802 million), the
U.S.-based company said in a statement today. Liberty agreed to
pay the private equity company 870 million zloty and will repay
its debt of 1.53 billion zloty.  The transaction adds to $13.9 billion of Polish mergers
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, up from
$4.61 billion in all of 2009 after Banco Santander SA of Spain
bought Bank Zachodni WBK SA for 16.6 billion zloty and Cyfrowy
Polsat SA paid 3.75 billion zloty for Telewizja Polsat SA.  Aster, which operates mainly in Warsaw and Krakow, had
368,000 TV subscribers, 177,000 Internet customers and 70,000
users of its phone services on Sept. 30, Liberty said in the
statement. It said the deal values Aster at 7.3 times its 2011
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Mid Europa Partners LLP, a London-based buyout firm
targeting midsized deals in central and eastern Europe, doubled
its original investment in the sale and had a 23 percent
internal rate of return,  Matthew Strassberg , the partner who led
the transaction, said in a phone interview.  UPC is the largest cable TV operator in Poland with 1.1
million customers, according to Liberty’s website.  The transaction is subject to Polish antitrust office
approval. Liberty said it expects to close the deal in the first
half of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
