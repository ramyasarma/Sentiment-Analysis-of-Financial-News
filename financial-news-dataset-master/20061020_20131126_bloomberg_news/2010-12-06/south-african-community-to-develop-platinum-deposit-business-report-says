South Africa’s Bengwenyama community
plans to develop two properties in the northern Limpopo province
that may contain shallow platinum deposits, Business Report
said, citing Joel Nkosi, vice-chairman of the Bengwenyama
Community Trust.  Last week, the community successfully applied to the
Constitutional Court to set aside prospecting rights granted to
Genorah Resources Ltd., the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
