Verigy Ltd. , a maker of testing
equipment for semiconductor manufacturers, surged as much as 45
percent after it received an unsolicited takeover offer from
 Advantest Corp.   Advantest offered $12.15 a share, Verigy said today in a
statement. Verigy has an existing sale agreement with  LTX-
Credence Corp.   Machines made by the three companies are key to
manufacturing semiconductors. While Verigy said the Advantest
offer is “not superior” to the LTX-Credence deal, it is
entering negotiations with Advantest to try to create a better
transaction.  A combination of LTX-Credence and Verigy would be better
for customers, employees and shareholders than an acquisition by
Advantest, LTX said in a separate statement.  Verigy, based in Singapore,  surged  $3.81, or 42 percent, to
$12.95 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the
biggest jump since shares were sold to the public in June 2006.
LTX, based in Milpitas, California,  dropped  $1.05, or 12
percent, to $7.40. Advantest American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, fell 18 cents to $21.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
