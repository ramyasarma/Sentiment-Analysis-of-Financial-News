Capcom Co. , the Japanese publisher of
the “Monster Hunter” video-game franchise, rose to the highest
level in more than six weeks in Tokyo trading after saying the
newest installment in the series sold 2 million units in Japan.  Capcom  climbed 2.4 percent to 1,305 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break, set for the highest closing price since Oct. 22.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent.  The company’s “Monster Hunter Portable 3rd” for  Sony
Corp. ’s PlayStation Portable achieved the sales since the Dec. 1
release, Osaka-based Capcom said in a statement today. The title,
where gamers play the role of warriors hunting beasts, brings
total sales in the series to 15 million units, it said.  Capcom, which gets about 80 percent of its profit from
video-game software, is counting on releases such as “Monster
Hunter” and “Marvel Vs. Capcom 3” to triple net income this
fiscal year ending March 2011. Demand for the monster-action
game also bolstered sales of Sony’s PSP last month, helping the
handheld outsell rival  Nintendo Co. ’s DS for the first time in
half a year, according to researcher Enterbrain Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
