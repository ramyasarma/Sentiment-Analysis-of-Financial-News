Commonwealth Bank of Australia has
rejected calls to make bank account numbers portable between
lenders because it will impose high costs for the 250,000
organizations that access the payment system, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing submissions to a Senate
inquiry into banking competition. CBA defended profit levels,
saying Australian banks were generating returns broadly in line
with the 30-year average for the sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
