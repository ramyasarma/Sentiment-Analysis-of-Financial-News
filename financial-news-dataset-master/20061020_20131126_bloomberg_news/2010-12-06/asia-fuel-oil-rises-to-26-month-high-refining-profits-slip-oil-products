Asian fuel oil and gasoil swaps rose
for a third day to the highest in 26 months. Product crack
spreads narrowed in Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil-trading and
storage center, signaling reduced refining profit.  Benchmark crude futures in New York also traded near a 26-
month high above $89 a barrel on speculation a U.S. economic
recovery would bolster fuel demand.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January rose $1.75, or 0.3
percent, to $513.25 a metric ton at 12 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. That’s
the highest since Oct. 3, 2008. The product’s  discount  to Dubai
crude, the Asian bellwether, widened 75 cents to $9.14 a barrel,
indicating losses from making the residue were the most since
March 2009.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was unchanged after climbing on Dec. 3 to $9.75
a ton, based on PVM data. This  viscosity spread  was the widest
since Nov. 23, signaling bunker, or marine fuel, has risen less
than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  January  gasoil , or diesel, swaps increased 60 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $102.23 a barrel, the highest since Oct. 6, 2008,
according to PVM. The premium to Dubai crude fell 42 cents to
$14.13 a barrel, ending a three-day rally. This  crack spread , a
measure of refining profit, was at $14.55 on Dec. 3, the widest
since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after dropping
to $1.20 a barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  was at the narrowest
since Nov. 22, meaning it’s less profitable to produce aviation
fuel compared with diesel.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for first-half January delivery were bid at $850.50 a
ton against offers at $853.50, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from the Dec. 3 close of
$835.50.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose to $7.90 a barrel on
Dec. 3, the strongest since Aug. 12, Bloomberg calculations
showed. A widening  reforming margin  shows motor fuel is more
profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
