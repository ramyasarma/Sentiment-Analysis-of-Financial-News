The International Criminal Court has
started a preliminary war-crimes investigation following North
Korea’s shelling of a South Korean island last month and the
sinking of a South Korean warship earlier this year.  After receiving communications alleging that North Korean
forces committed war crimes in the territory of South Korea, the
prosecutor will evaluate whether the incidents fall under the
jurisdiction of the court, according to a  statement  today by the
Hague-based ICC.  The statement referred to the sinking of a South Korean
warship, the Cheonan, allegedly hit by a torpedo from a North
Korean submarine on March 26, killing 46 people and the shelling
of Yeonpyeong Island on the Nov. 23, leading to the death of
South Korean marines and civilians.  Nicola Fletcher, spokeswoman of the Office of the ICC’s
Prosecutor, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Tensions have risen on the Korean peninsula since North
Korea’s attack on Yeonpyeong island. South Korea’s military
began live-firing drills off its coastline, prompting North
Korea to issue the warning that the South risked “catastrophic
consequences” with its plans.  Established under the 1998 Rome Statute, a treaty signed by
representatives of 106 states during a UN conference, the ICC is
the only permanent tribunal for prosecuting individuals
responsible for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity
committed anywhere in the world. Other preliminary examinations
include Afghanistan and Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
