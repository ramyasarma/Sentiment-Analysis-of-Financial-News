An  OAO Aeroflot  flight was cleared to
leave for Moscow from Berlin after German police acting on a
tipoff evacuated the plane and found no evidence of explosives
aboard.  All 190 passengers were evacuated from flight SU 112 at
Berlin Schoenefeld airport today after police in the German
capital received a telephone warning that a bomb might be on
board, Federal Police spokesman Sven Drese said. The plane was
taken to a secure position at the airport and searched by a
security team including sniffer dogs.  “We’ve concluded that there was no bomb or explosive
substance on board,” Drese said by phone. The flight will leave
Berlin for Moscow later today.  Several media organizations received a related fax that
involved claims from an alleged insurgency group in Chechnya,
the southern Russian region that rebelled against the government
in Moscow in 1994 and 2000, the spokesman said.  Police are also investigating whether the threat was
connected to about 50 undocumented Vietnamese nationals aboard
the flight who were being deported via Moscow, Drese said.  German authorities announced increased security at airports
and railway stations on Nov. 17 after receiving “concrete
indications” that Islamist extremists planned to stage an
attack in Germany toward the end of last month. Interior
Minister  Thomas de Maiziere  warned of a “new threat level”
after receiving intelligence from an unidentified foreign ally
and gathering evidence domestically from Islamist groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
