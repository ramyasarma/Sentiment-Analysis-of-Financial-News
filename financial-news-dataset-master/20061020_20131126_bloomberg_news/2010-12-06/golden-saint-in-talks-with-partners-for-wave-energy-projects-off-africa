Golden Saint Australia , a gold
exploration company, said it is in talks with a European company
to develop wave-energy projects off western Africa.  The discussions, at an initial stage, could result in a
deal early next year, Chairman Cyril D’Silva said in an
interview. He declined to name the company it is having
discussions with, citing confidentiality agreements.  Golden Saint plans to use part of the proceeds from a
planned A$30 million ($29.6 million) initial public offering in
March to help fund the projects. The shares would trade on the
Australian Stock Exchange.  “Our studies show that there is strong potential for wave-
energy projects in west Africa,” D’Silva said. “It can provide
a cost-effective source of energy.”  Golden Saint’s main business is mining for gold and
diamonds in Liberia and Sierra Leone. The company is close to a
deal to acquire a jewelry company with funds from the share
offering. The 25-year-old firm, which has a manufacturing and
diamond polishing business, also wholesales and retails.  The acquisition will help Golden Saint generate revenue
immediately, D’Silva said. He declined to name the company. The
firm is in the process of acquiring four exploration concessions
for gold and diamond in Sierra Leone and currently holds
prospecting licenses in Liberia, D’Silva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
