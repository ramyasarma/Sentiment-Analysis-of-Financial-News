The Census Bureau estimates the U.S.
population is 305.7 million to 312.7 million, based on an
analysis of data available before its official count was
conducted.  The  estimates  were compiled from data as of April 1 and are
not part of the overall  2010 count , the agency said today at a
news conference in Washington. Still, the Census Bureau said the
numbers represent possible growth trends of certain demographic
groups. The 2010 census results will be released before Jan. 1
as required by law.  “The 2010 Census provides the official population count,
but demographic analysis provides an honest presentation of
alternative estimates,”  Robert Groves , director of the Census
Bureau, said in a statement. These figures “make plausible
assumptions,” he told reporters at a media briefing in
Washington.  Today’s numbers, compiled separately from the official
census, mark the first  wave  of data that offer a snapshot of the
U.S. and its residents. The census will influence the allocation
of about $4 trillion in federal funds during the next decade and
will determine which states will gain or lose seats in the House
of Representatives.  ‘Wait and See’  “We will all wait and see” what the census numbers
provide in the exact population count, Groves said at the press
briefing.  Later this month -- and before the overall population count
is announced -- the agency will publish findings from an annual
 survey  sent to about 3 million U.S. households. The data will be
an average from 2005 to 2009 and will offer estimates for topics
including income, poverty, foreign-born population, commute time
to work and housing costs. Those numbers will be released Dec.
14.  The U.S. population in 2000 was 281.4 million, and in 1990
it was 248.7 million, according to the Census Bureau. Today’s
population projections, based on the high-range estimate of
312.7 million, mean that there was an 11.1 percent rate of
growth during the past 10 years. That is slower than the 13.1
percent pace in the previous decade.  Gender, Race Estimates  Today’s  report  offered population estimates for categories
such as gender, race and age. The analysis shows the number of
males in the U.S. is as low as 151.9 million or as high as 155.5
million. For women, the range is from 153.7 million to 157.2
million.  The  black population  in the U.S. ranged from 40.9 million
to 41.7 million, the Census Bureau said. The number of young
Hispanics -- limited to residents under the age of 20 since not
enough states began gathering detailed race information until
1990 -- ranged from 18.3 million to 21.3 million.  Figures released today did not include an estimate of the
number of white residents. “The non-black population has become
a lot more diverse,” Jason Devine, head of methodology research
in the agency’s population division, said in an interview. He
said census demographers for this report focused more on the
changing Hispanic population.  The data measured the non-black population, which includes
Hispanics and other races. That figure ranged from 264.8 million
to 271 million.  The U.S. Constitution requires the federal government to
count the population every 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
