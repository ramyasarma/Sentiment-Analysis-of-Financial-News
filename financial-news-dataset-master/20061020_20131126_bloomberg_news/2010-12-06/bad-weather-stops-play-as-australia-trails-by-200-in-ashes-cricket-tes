Bad light and rain stopped play on
day four of the second Ashes cricket Test in Adelaide with
Australia trailing England by 200 runs.  Australia was 175-3 in its second innings when the players
came off in the sixth over after the tea interval for bad light.
Heavy rain then began falling and the pitch surrounds were
covered by groundstaff at the Adelaide Oval.  England earlier declared at 620-5, a first-innings lead of
375 runs.  No play was possible yesterday after tea because of rain
and Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology forecasts showers and
thunderstorms for tomorrow’s final day.  The best-of-five series is tied at 0-0 after England
recovered from a 221-run first-innings deficit to draw in
Brisbane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
