Italy and Spain led an increase in
the cost of insuring bonds sold by Europe’s peripheral nations
as divisions emerged over how best to limit contagion from the
region’s budget deficit crisis.  Credit-default swaps on Italy rose 8.5 basis points to
217.5 while Spain increased 20 basis points to 317, according to
data provider CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of swaps on 15 governments rose 8.25 basis points to 185.  European Union officials are at odds over whether to
increase the 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) bailout fund as they
meet in Brussels today. Divisions appeared last week when a plan
to buy government bonds only won support from an “overwhelming
majority” of member states and an extension of liquidity
measures was endorsed by “consensus,” according to European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet .  “Both underscore the political controversy in Europe
regarding these measures,”  Maureen Schuller , a credit
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, wrote in a note to
investors. “This, in our opinion, will remain the single most
important source of credit market volatility.”  Swaps on Ireland were 12.5 basis points higher at 555 and
Portugal was up 15.5 to 443.5, according to CMA.  Portuguese Protection  MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, said it bought
$200 million of swaps to protect against declines in Portugal’s
sovereign debt. The company entered the contracts in connection
with the acquisition of American Life Insurance Co., Chief
Investment Officer  Steven Kandarian  said at a presentation in
New York, where the company is based.  Sovereign concerns undermined investor perceptions of
financial creditworthiness, with subordinated contracts on
Portuguese and Spanish lenders heading an increase in bank bond
risk, according to CMA.  Swaps on the junior debt of Banco Comercial Portugues SA
rose 5 percentage points to 31 percent upfront and 5 percent a
year, meaning it costs 3.1 million euros in advance and 500,000
euros annually to insure 10 million euros of bonds for five
years. Banco Espirito Santo SA rose 4 percentage points to 31
percent upfront.  Swaps on the subordinated debt of Banco Santander SA
increased 31 basis points to 375 and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA rose 31 basis points to 394.  Financial Index  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the
subordinated debt of 25 banks and insurers surged 19 basis
points to 299 and the senior index increased 9 basis points to
156, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 3 basis
points to 469. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings rose 1.25 basis point to 107.75,
JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
