Randall Yoakum  and Gary Pokrzywinski,
both former Washington Mutual Inc. executives, have co-founded a
money-management  firm  advising clients on investing in high-
yield debt and asset allocation.  The two opened Seattle-based Strategic Income Management
LLC in October. Pokrzywinski most recently served as chief
investment officer for  Principal Financial Group Inc. ’s Edge
Asset Management and Yoakum was its chief investment strategist.
Both previously worked at WM Advisors Inc., a Washington Mutual
unit sold to Principal Financial in 2006.  Their new company, known as SiM, is working with
American Beacon Advisors Inc. to start and manage American
Beacon SiM High Yield Opportunities Fund, slated to begin
investing in speculative-grade bonds and loans early next year.
The startup is also teaming with First Trust to establish SiM
60/40 Dynamic Allocation Portfolio, which will invest in equity
and fixed-income exchange-traded funds.  “We have been and remain overweight in high yield,”
Pokrzywinski said in a telephone interview. “It will obviously
be an asset class that is enduring, and one that’s competitive
with anything out there.”  Pokrzywinski formerly managed the $2.3 billion Principal
High Yield Fund, rated five stars by Morningstar Inc. In 2009,
the fund won the Lipper Fund Award for best performance over
five years in the high-current-yield category.  High-yield, high-risk debt, known as junk, is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s and less than BBB- by S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
