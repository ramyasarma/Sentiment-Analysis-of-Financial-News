Continental Airlines postponed the
November 2011 start of Houston-Auckland service until sometime
in 2012 because of an expected additional delay in delivery of
 Boeing Co.’s  787.  Continental, a unit of  United Continental Holdings Inc. ,
declined to say today when it expects to receive its first 787
following Boeing’s decision to revise its production schedule
after a fire on a test jet. Continental originally was to
receive its first 787 Dreamliner in March 2009.  The Houston-based carrier was the first U.S. customer for
the 787, which has been delayed by parts shortages, redesigns
and Boeing’s greater reliance on suppliers. Delta Air Lines Inc.
said in October it would defer deliveries of 18 787s into the
next decade.  “In anticipation of Boeing advising us of further delays,
we’re going to push the service to 2012,”  Julie King , a
Continental spokeswoman, said of the Houston-Auckland flight.
“Commencement of the service does depend on delivery of the
787.”  Continental, which has ordered 25 Dreamliners, is in
regular talks with Boeing about the aircraft and expects to
receive more information on a new delivery schedule by early
next year, King said.  The airline intends to begin flights between Houston and
Lagos, Nigeria, on Nov. 10 with a Boeing 777 instead of a 787 as
originally planned. The Houston-Auckland flight was set to begin
on Nov. 16 and hadn’t been put up for purchase yet.  “We’re committed to the route, but it works with a 787,
given that it’s the right-sized aircraft to meet the demand in
the market,” King said.  The Houston Chronicle reported the Auckland service delay
earlier today.  United Continental Holdings slid 69 cents, or 2.5 percent,
to $27.04 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange  composite
trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
