Molycorp Inc. , owner of the world’s
largest non-Chinese deposit of rare-earth metals, rose the most
in more than four months after Nikkei English News reported
Sumitomo Corp. may buy a stake in the U.S. company.  Molycorp climbed $5.06, or 18 percent, to $32.86 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
gain since the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company’s
initial public offering in July.  Sumitomo, Japan’s third-largest trading company, may agree
to buy a stake in Molycorp this week, Nikkei said, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Japan, the largest rare-earth importer, has stepped up
efforts to diversify supply sources after shipments from China
were disrupted in September. China accounts for 97 percent of
global supply of rare-earths, used in electric-vehicle
batteries, catalysts for refining petroleum, computer disk
drives and military radar.  Jim Allen , Molycorp’s chief financial officer, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment. No one was immediately
available for comment when Bloomberg News called Sumitomo’s
headquarters in Tokyo outside of normal business hours.  Rare Element Resources Ltd. , a Vancouver-based rare-earth
miner, jumped $1.38, or 14 percent, to $11.20 in New York
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
