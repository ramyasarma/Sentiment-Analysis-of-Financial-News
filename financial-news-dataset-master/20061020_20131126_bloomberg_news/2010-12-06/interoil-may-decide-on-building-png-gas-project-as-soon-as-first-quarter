InterOil Corp.  aims to make an
investment decision on a liquefied natural gas project in Papua
New Guinea as early as the first quarter of 2011 after raising
$266 million to fund ventures in the South Pacific nation.  “We’re in a position to move any time,” Chief Executive
Officer  Phil Mulacek  said in an interview in Sydney today. “We
don’t see anything there to prevent it.” The explorer, based in
Canada’s Yukon Territory and run from Cairns in Australia, is
awaiting the completion of engineering and design work, he said.  InterOil, whose shares have risen 73 percent since June 7,
said Nov. 15 it expected to reach a final investment decision by
the end of June. The Canadian company seeks to develop an LNG
project in Papua New Guinea that would follow a larger, $15
billion LNG development led by  Exxon Mobil Corp.   The project may begin production in late 2013 or early
2014, Mulacek said today. He declined to give a cost estimate.  InterOil in late September signed an agreement with  Energy
World Corp.  to build a 2 million-ton-a-year LNG plant in the
Gulf Province of Papua New Guinea. The company also plans a
project to tap resources from the Elk and Antelope fields and to
process light oils through a venture with Mitsui & Co.  The explorer said last month it raised $266 million selling
shares and notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
