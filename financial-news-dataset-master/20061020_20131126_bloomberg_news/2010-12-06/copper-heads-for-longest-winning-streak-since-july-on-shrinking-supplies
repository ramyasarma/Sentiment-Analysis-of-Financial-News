Copper climbed for a fifth day, and
headed for its longest rally since July, on concern supplies may
lag behind demand as inventories shrink and on expectation the
Federal Reserve may take more steps to boost economic growth.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.8 percent to $8,790.50 a metric ton,
the highest price since Nov. 12, and traded at $8,762.25 at 2:59
p.m. in Singapore. Aluminum, zinc and nickel advanced.  The prospect of an exchange-traded fund is also boosting
investor confidence, said Wang Yangyi, an analyst at Nanhua
Futures Co. JPMorgan Chase & Co., which will introduce a U.S.
exchange-traded fund for physical copper, has acquired more than
half of the inventory tracked by the LME, the Daily Telegraph
reported, citing a source close to the situation.  “There are several reasons to push prices higher,
including falling stockpiles and the possibility of further
easing by the Federal Reserve,” Nanhua’s Wang said from
Zhejiang. Commodities are benefitting from investors seeking
alternative investments to declining currencies, Wang said.  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange traded little changed after climbing as much as 0.4
percent to 66,050 yuan ($9,936) earlier. Comex futures in New
York advanced as much as 0.8 percent to $4.029 a pound, the
highest level since Nov. 12.  Copper  stockpiles  in LME warehouses have shrunk 30 percent
this year, dropping to 353,625 tons, near the lowest level since
October 2009, exchange data show. Inventories monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange fell last week for a second week.  Dwindling Inventories  One unidentified company held between 50 percent and 79
percent of LME copper stockpiles from Nov. 22 through to Dec. 1,
the latest exchange data show. JPMorgan holds the inventory, the
Daily Telegraph reported. A call to JPMorgan’s media relations
office in New York outside of office hours wasn’t answered.  J.P. Morgan Physical Copper Trust will hold only so-called
grade-A copper and not futures, the bank said in an Oct. 22
filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  One firm held between 50 percent and 79 percent of LME-
monitored deliverable copper stockpiles on certain dates in July
and November last year. In 2008, one company held most of the
inventories, at times exceeding 90 percent, for several months.  Buyers on Dec. 1 paid $74 a ton, the largest premium in two
years, for immediate supply, relative to the three-month
contract. That gap narrowed to $42 a ton on Dec. 3.  Under LME rules, a firm holding 50 percent to 79 percent of
the deliverable stockpiles has to lend the metal to buyers at no
more than 0.5 percent of the cash price for a day.  Fed Easing  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said U.S.
unemployment may take five years to fall to a normal level and
Fed purchases of Treasury securities are possible beyond the
$600 billion announced last month. The unemployment rate rose to
a seven-month high of 9.8 percent in November as payroll growth
slowed to 39,000 from 172,000, the Labor Department said.  In Chile, wage talks at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata
Plc’s Collahuasi venture will continue today as union and
company representatives failed to reach a wage agreement in a
seventh day of talks.  Workers at the world’s third-biggest copper mine have been
on strike for a month, the longest recorded dispute at a major
Chilean copper mine, surpassing the 26-day strike at BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida in 2006.  Aluminum in London rose 1.2 percent to $2,345.75 a ton,
zinc gained 1.3 percent to $2,248 a ton and lead climbed 1.3
percent to $2,370.50 a ton. Nickel advanced 1.1 percent to
$23,750 a ton, while tin increased 0.6 percent to $25,700 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
