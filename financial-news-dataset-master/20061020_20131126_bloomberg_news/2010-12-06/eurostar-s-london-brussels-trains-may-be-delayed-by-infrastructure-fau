Eurostar Group Ltd. said rail
passengers using its services between London and Brussels may
experience some delays today because of an “infrastructure

operator’s website.  Thalys high-speed rail services between Paris and Brussels
also face disruption, Thalys said on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
