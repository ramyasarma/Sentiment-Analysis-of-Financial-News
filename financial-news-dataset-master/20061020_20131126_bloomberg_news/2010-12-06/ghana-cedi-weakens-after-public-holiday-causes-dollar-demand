Ghana’s  currency, the cedi, weakened
against the dollar after a public holiday caused demand for the
greenback to accumulate.  The cedi depreciated for the third trading session out of
four by 0.2 percent to 1.4565 at 1:10 p.m. in Accra, from a
close Dec. 2 of 1.4530, said Chris Nettey, a currency trader at
 Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s  unit in the West African nation.  Dec. 3 was a public holiday in Ghana, closing shops and
offices in celebration of Farmers’ Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
