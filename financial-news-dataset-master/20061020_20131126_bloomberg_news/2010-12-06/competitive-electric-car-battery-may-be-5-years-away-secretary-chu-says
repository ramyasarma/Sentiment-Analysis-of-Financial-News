Development of an electric car
battery able to compete with the internal combustion engine may
be five years away, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said.  The storage capacity of current electric car batteries
needs to be increased by a factor of six or seven times in order
to be acceptable to car drivers, Chu said. Their lives need to
be extended to 15 years, and the cost needs to be reduced by a
factor of three, he said.  “Is there any hope of being competitive with an internal
combustion car engine? The answer is yes,” Chu said in a speech
in Cancun, Mexico, where United Nations climate envoys from 193
nations are holding global warming treaty talks. “It’s not like
it’s 10 years off. It might be 5 years off.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
