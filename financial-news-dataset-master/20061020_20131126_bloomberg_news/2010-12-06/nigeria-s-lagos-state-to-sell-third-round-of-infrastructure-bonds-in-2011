Nigeria’s Lagos state plans to sell a
third series of infrastructure bonds next year, raising 60
billion naira ($396 million) in funds needed to support
expansion in one of the fastest growing cities in the world.  The sale still needs regulatory approval, said  Ben Akabueze , the state’s commission for economic planning and
budget, in an interview in Abuja, the capital, today. He didn’t
say what the coupon rate would be.  Lagos, the commercial capital of Africa’s top oil producer,
is upgrading roads, railways and bridges to cope with a growing
population, currently estimated at around 17 million people,
according to  the World Bank . State Governor Babatunde Fashola
said in March the city is planning a new urban rail system, a
free-trade zone and expansion of a highway to neighboring Benin.  The state sold 50 billion in five-year bonds in 2008 and a
sale of seven-year notes worth the same amount in April as part
of plans to raise a total of 275 billion naira in different
tranches.  “They’re in pole position in terms of capacity to pay back
because they generate a lot of income outside of the federal
government allocation,” said Pabina Yinkere, an analyst at
Lagos-based fund manager Vetiva Capital Management Ltd. The
state is one of the few in the country that generates revenue
internally, Yinkere said.  Lagos is home to Nigeria’s biggest companies, including
 Nigeria Breweries Plc  and Dangote Group. The country’s main
stock exchange is also based in the Atlantic ocean-side city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
