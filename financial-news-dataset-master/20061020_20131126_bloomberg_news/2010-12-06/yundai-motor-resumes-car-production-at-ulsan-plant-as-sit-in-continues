Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest carmaker, resumed production at its factory in Ulsan
today as a sit-in protest by temporary workers continued.  Production at the plant, southeast of Seoul, stopped
Nov. 15 with the striking workers demanding they be made
permanent employees, according to the company. The halt has
stopped the manufacturing of 23,937 passenger cars worth 270
billion won ($238 million) as of Dec. 4, Hyundai said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The automaker, based in Seoul, has rerouted production at
the plant to avoid the striking workers, enabling it to resume
production at 50 percent of full capacity, it said.  Hyundai  fell  2.2 percent to 180,000 won as of 10:41 a.m. in
Seoul trading. The shares have risen 49 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
