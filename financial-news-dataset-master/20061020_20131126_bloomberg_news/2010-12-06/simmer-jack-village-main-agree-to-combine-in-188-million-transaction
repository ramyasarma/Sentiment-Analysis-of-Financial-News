Village Main Reef Gold Mining Co .,
headed by former  Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.  Chief Executive
Officer  Bernard Swanepoel , agreed to buy  Simmer & Jack Mines
Ltd.  in a transaction worth 1.3 billion rand ($188 million).  The deal offers “significant gold production and exposure
to uranium,” said Swanepoel, CEO of Johannesburg-based Village.  South African gold producers have been seeking to boost
output to benefit from record prices. Simmers, which owns the
Buffelsfontein, Hartebeestfontein and Tau Lekoa gold mines,
reported output of 36,608 ounces in the three months through
September, double the previous quarter, it said on Nov. 22.
Simmers also owns a 33 percent stake in  First Uranium Corp.   The main focus will be establishing the merged company as a
“mid-tier gold company,” Swanepoel said today by mobile phone.  The agreed price represents a premium of 14.7 percent to
the volume weighted average price at which Simmers traded for
the 30 days preceding the date of the announcement, the
companies said in a joint statement.  Harmony grew almost sixfold under Swanepoel, from a single-
mine operator in 1995 to Africa’s third-biggest gold producer.
He quit in Aug. 2007 after a miscalculation of production costs.  Simmer climbed 2 percent to 1 rand by the 5 p.m. close of
trading in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 1.25 billion
rand. Village advanced 4.4 percent to 2.40 rand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
