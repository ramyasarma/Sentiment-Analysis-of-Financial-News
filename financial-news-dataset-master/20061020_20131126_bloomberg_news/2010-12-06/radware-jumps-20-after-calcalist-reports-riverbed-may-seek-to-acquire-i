(Corrects spelling of spokeswoman’s name in fifth
paragraph.)  Radware Ltd. , the maker of technology
that helps Internet networks run more efficiently, jumped 21
percent after Israeli newspaper Calcalist reported Riverbed
Technology Inc. may seek to acquire it.  Radware, based in Tel Aviv, gained $7.01 to $39.77 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
have  more than doubled  this year.  The company’s technology would help a buyer cater to
customers aiming to cope with rising reams of digital
information, said  Ashok Kumar , an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw
LLC in New York. Companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Dell Inc. are using deals to step up their ability to sell
products and services that help providers equip data centers.  “Radware does have very attractive intellectual property
for players who are looking to expand their footprint in the
data center market,” said Kumar, who  rates  Radware “outperform”
and doesn’t own the shares. “Further consolidation in this space
is inevitable.”  Joyce Anne Shulman , a Radware  spokeswoman , and Jin Woo, a
spokesman for San Francisco-based Riverbed, declined to comment.  HP, based in Palo Alto, California, is also in talks to buy
Radware, according to Globes, another Israeli news service.  Gina Tyler , a spokeswoman for HP, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
