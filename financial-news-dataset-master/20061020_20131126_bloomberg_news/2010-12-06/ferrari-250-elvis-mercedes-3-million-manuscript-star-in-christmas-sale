Collectors looking for a special
Christmas treat to buy this week can choose from a 1958 Ferrari
250 that raced in the last Mille Miglia, a 1970 Mercedes-Benz
that was once owned by  Elvis Presley  -- or a 700-year-old
illustrated manuscript valued at $3 million.  The Ferrari has an upper estimate of 1 million pounds ($1.6
million), and is the most valuable of 141 cars offered by the
London-based auction houses Coys and Bonhams in pre-Christmas
sales. The manuscript, telling the story of King Arthur and the
Holy Grail, is being auctioned at  Sotheby’s .  Risk-wary investors in Europe and North America are taking
their time to return to auction markets after the crisis slashed
values in some collecting areas by up to 50 percent.  “For cars, we’ve seen substantial  price rises  over the
last 10 to 15 years,”  Dietrich Hatlapa , founder and managing
director of Historic Automobile Group International (HAGI), a
London-based independent research company, said in an interview.
“2010 will go down as the year the market took a breather.”  The  HAGI index  of exceptional classic-car prices declined
1.52 percent in October, said www.historicautogroup.com.  The Coys Ferrari 250GT LWB “Tour de France” participated
in the 1958 Mille Miglia, the last of the original races around
Italy, before being damaged in a crash in 1961 and undergoing
extensive restoration in the 1980s.  “It’s the original chassis with some original
components,” Chris Routledge, managing director of  Coys , said.
“If it was a 5/5 Ferrari, it would be 3 million pounds. This is
an excellent example of a car you can use.”  Surtees Mercedes  The 65-car auction, to be held tomorrow in London, is
expected to raise as much as 8 million pounds.  A Ferrari-red 1956 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing that had been
owned for 18 years by the former World Champion driver John
Surtees carries an estimate of 360,000 pounds to 400,000 pounds.  Bonhams  today sold another Gullwing with a similar
estimate, this time in silver and dating from 1955, for 441,500
pounds at its auction of 76 cars at Mercedes-Benz World,
Brooklands, Surrey.  An altogether less sporty Mercedes 600 Saloon Limousine,
one of two luxury models bought by the “King” in 1970 when he
was re-launching his career, carried a price tag of 150,000
pounds to 200,000 pounds. It was finally sold for 80,700 pounds
to an unidentified German collector, the auction house said.  The Bonhams event is estimated to fetch as much as 5.8
million pounds. In October in London, rival auction house  RM  saw
four out of six vehicles expected to fetch as much as 1 million
pounds sell for hammer prices below the low estimate. These
included James Bond’s “Goldfinger” Aston Martin, bought by one
of two bidders at 2.9 million pounds.  Arthur’s Manuscript  The manuscript for sale, the Rochefoucauld Grail, narrates
the adventures of the legendary British king Arthur, his court
at Camelot and their quest for the cup that was used to collect
the blood of Christ at the crucifixion.  The manuscript, offered by  Sotheby’s  tomorrow, was made in
France or Flanders in about 1315 and is illustrated with 107
miniatures on vellum. At least 200 cows would have been needed
to produce the sheets, said Sotheby’s, which estimates it at as
much as 2 million pounds.  “The subjects are almost entirely secular -- a
breathtakingly unusual thing at the time -- with scenes of
jousts, tournaments and battles, noble adventures and daring
tests of strength and courage,” said Timothy Bolton, a
Sotheby’s manuscripts specialist.  Some of the scenes, such as Lancelot and Gawain being
pelted with filth by the inhabitants of a walled town, have a
Monty Pythonesque quality that has been noticed by prospective
buyers at the view, Bolton said: “They appeal to the modern
age, and the stories they tell were the ultimate source for ‘The
Da Vinci Code,’ ‘Indiana Jones’ and Python’s ‘Holy Grail.’”  The manuscript is being sold by the Dutch collector J.R.
Ritman for the benefit of the  Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica 
in Amsterdam.  Birds of America  Three hours later, Sotheby’s will be selling a first
edition of  John James Audubon ’s early 19th-century illustrated
“Birds of America,” which may fetch a record 6 million pounds
($9.2 million).  Skull in Italy  Damien Hirst ’s $100 million diamond and platinum skull is
now on show in a medieval town hall in Italy.  The 1,106-carat sculpture, “For the Love of God,” was
exhibited on Nov. 26 at the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, where it
will remain until May 1, 2011.  The presentation in the private chamber of Duke Cosimo I
de’ Medici has been produced by the Italian-based exhibition
organizers, Arthemisia Group. This is the first time the skull
has been put on public display since 2008, when it was shown at
the  Rijksmuseum , Amsterdam, and attracted 250,000 visitors.  A projected world tour, beginning in 2008 at the State
Hermitage Museum in Russia, fell through because of security
costs. The work, encrusted with 8,601 pave-set diamonds, was
first exhibited by Hirst’s London gallery White Cube in June
2007, at the height of the art boom.  It was priced at a record 50 million pounds. In August of
that year,  Frank Dunphy , who was then the artist’s business
manager, announced that the skull had been bought by an
investment group. The purchasers would be required to show the
skull for two or three years in museums around the world, he
said. The investors in the buying group included himself, the
artist and his dealer  Jay Jopling , Bloomberg News reported in
August 2007.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
