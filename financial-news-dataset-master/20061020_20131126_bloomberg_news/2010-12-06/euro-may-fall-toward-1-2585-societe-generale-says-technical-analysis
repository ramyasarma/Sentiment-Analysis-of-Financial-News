The euro may drop as low as $1.2585
against the dollar after it failed to break above a key
resistance area, Societe Generale SA said, citing technical
indicators.  “The $1.3445/1.3450 pullback area forced euro-dollar to
turn lower, confirming the short-term risk is to the downside,”
technical analysts  Hugues Naka  and  Fabien Manac’h  in Paris wrote
in a research note today. “A dip back to last week’s low at
$1.2970 remains the most likely scenario.”  The euro dropped 0.9 percent to $1.3288 at 2:51 p.m. in
London. It reached $1.2969 on Nov. 30, according to Bloomberg
data.  “A break below this low and then below the $1.2920
pullback level would call for a dip to the $1.2585/90 region
before euro-dollar attempts to head north again,” they wrote.
That compares with the $1.2588 low from Aug. 24, according to
Bloomberg data.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy orders may be
grouped, and resistance is a level where sell orders may be
clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
