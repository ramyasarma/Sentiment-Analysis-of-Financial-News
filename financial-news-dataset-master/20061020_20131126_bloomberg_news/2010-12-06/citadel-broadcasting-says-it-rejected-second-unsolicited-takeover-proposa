Citadel Broadcasting Corp. , the U.S.
radio-station owner that emerged from bankruptcy in June, rose
7 percent in over-the-counter trading after saying it rejected
two unsolicited merger offers from an undisclosed party.  The Las Vegas-based company received a proposal for a
“merger transaction” early last month and an “improved” bid
Nov. 29, according to a regulatory filing today. Its board
rejected both offers as not in shareholders’ best interests. The
New York Times’s Dealbook blog reported that the bidder was
 Cumulus Media Inc.   Jonathan Doorley , a spokesman for Citadel,
declined to comment. Cumulus Chief Financial Officer  J.P. Hannan 
didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Citadel exited bankruptcy protection June 3, and has a
market capitalization of about $1.48 billion, according to
Bloomberg data. The company sought Chapter 11 protection last
December, saying the recession had “put a chokehold on
advertising spending,” its main source of revenue.  The company is the third-largest radio broadcaster in the
U.S., with 224 stations including WLS in Chicago and WABC in New
York. The company added $2 billion in debt when it acquired the
ABC Radio Network and radio stations from Walt Disney Co. in
2007.  The company’s Class A shares  rose  $1.75 to $26.75 at 2:21
p.m. New York time in over-the-counter trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
