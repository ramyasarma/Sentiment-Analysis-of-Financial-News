Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, said it’s working to ensure stable prices in
the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming after a government
order to justify and give advance notice of increases.  The company has noticed the situation in Kunming and is
working with governments and suppliers to guarantee “supply of
products, in particular daily necessities, as well as a steady
price,”  Wal-Mart  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is cooperating with both
the local and central government, it said.  Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, on Dec. 3 ordered
five retailers including  Wal-Mart  and  Carrefour SA  to report and
give justifications for any price changes two days before making
alterations. Kunming’s consumer prices in the first 10 months
rose 4.4 percent, the highest among China’s 36 large- and
medium-size cities, the local government said in a statement.  Carrefour  China spokesman Chen Bo did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.  China’s attempts to combat inflation have sent stocks and
commodities sliding on speculation that the efforts will cool
the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The country’s State
Council, or cabinet, said Nov. 17 price caps on “important
daily necessities” and production materials will be used if
necessary.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
