The U.S. Treasury said today
it received $10.5 billion from the Dec. 6 sale of its final 2.4
billion shares of Citigroup Inc. common stock, locking in
at least $12 billion in profits from the government’s $45
billion rescue package.  “Treasury was able to exit its common stock investment in
Citigroup much more quickly than many had expected,” said  Tim Massad , acting assistant secretary for financial stability, in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
