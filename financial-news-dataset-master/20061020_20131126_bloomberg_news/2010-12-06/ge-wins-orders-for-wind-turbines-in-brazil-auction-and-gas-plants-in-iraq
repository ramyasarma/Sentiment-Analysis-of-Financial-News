General Electric Co. , the world’s
biggest provider of power-generation equipment, won orders for
more than 400 megawatts of wind turbines in an auction in Brazil
and three gas generators to expand a plant in Iraq.  The buyers of GE’s 1.5-megawatt and 1.6-megawatt wind
turbines in Brazil’s second alternative energy auction include
 Renova Energia SA , Dobreve Energia SA, ContourGlobal LLC and
Bioenergy, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said today in a
statement. The prices were not disclosed.  Mass Global Electric Co. agreed to buy three natural gas
turbines for a 375-megawatt expansion of the Arbil power plant
in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, GE said today in a separate
statement. The order is in addition to Mass Global’s plans to
increase generating capacity by 2,200 megawatts in the region.  GE Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is tapping
faster-growing emerging-markets such as Brazil and the Middle
East to bolster sales. GE said in November it plans to invest
$200 million to develop wind-turbine and energy technology in
Brazil as it expands operations in the nation. Last year it
announced a technology center in Saudi Arabia.  The Middle East remains one of the company’s most rapidly-
growing energy markets, with contracts exceeding $11 billion
over the past two years.  In addition to power-generation equipment, GE is the
world’s biggest maker of medical-imaging equipment, jet engines
and locomotives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
