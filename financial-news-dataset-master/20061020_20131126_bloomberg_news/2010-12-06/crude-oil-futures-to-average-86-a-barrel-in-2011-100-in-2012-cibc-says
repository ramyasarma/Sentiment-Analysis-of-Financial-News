Crude oil prices are likely to rise to
an average $86 a barrel next year and $100 in 2012 as demand
increases, CIBC World Markets commodities strategist Katherine Spector said.  Oil will average $80 a barrel this year on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , Spector said. Futures have traded in a
$25.52 a barrel range in 2010, between $64.24 and $89.76.  “We see oil trading in a wider range over the next two
years, rising moderately in 2011 to an $86 average, and
increasing more significantly in 2012 to $100,” Spector said in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
