Canada’s  Ivey index  of business and
government spending unexpectedly rose in November.  The gauge increased to 57.5 last month after a reading of
56.7 in October, according to the survey of 175 purchasing
managers by the Richard Ivey School of Business in London,
Ontario. The result compares with a  median estimate  of 56.4 in a
survey of 16 economists.  Business investment and exports will drive more of Canada’s
economic growth in the next two years, as consumer purchases and
government spending wane, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
predicted Oct. 20.  Economic growth  slowed to an annualized 1
percent in the third quarter, down from 2.3 percent in the
previous three months and slower than the central bank’s
prediction of 1.6 percent.  November’s reading is “consistent with a gradual recovery
through the balance of the year and into 2011,”  David Tulk , an
economist with TD Securities in Toronto, said in a note to
clients.  Readings above 50 indicate that purchasing expanded during
the month.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index rose to 59.5 in
November from 55.2 during the previous month, according to  Peter Buchanan , an economist with CIBC World Markets Inc. in Toronto.  The  inventory gauge  fell to 41.7 in November from 46.4 in
October, signaling stockpiles are falling at the fastest pace in
a year. The  price index  fell to 60, the slowest pace of cost
increases in four months.  The  supplier-deliveries measure  fell to 44 from 50,
signaling a rise in shipment times, and the  employment index 
advanced to 54.8 from 51.7, suggesting managers are hiring
workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
