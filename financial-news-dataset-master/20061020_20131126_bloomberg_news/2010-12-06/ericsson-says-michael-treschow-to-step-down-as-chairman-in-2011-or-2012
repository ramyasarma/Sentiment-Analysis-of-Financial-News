Ericsson AB  Chairman  Michael Treschow 
plans to step down from overseeing the world’s biggest maker of
mobile-phone networks in the next two years, saying the
manufacturer is “in good shape.”  Treschow, 67, will leave Stockholm-based Ericsson next year
or in 2012, the company said today in a statement. A successor
to Treschow, who became  chairman  in March 2002, will be
appointed at one of the next two annual shareholders’ meetings,
Ericsson said.  “This is something that has grown inside me since the
latter part of the fall,” Treschow said today in a phone
interview. “Nine years is a long time. The company is also very
stable and in  good shape . The combination probably makes for a
good time to find somebody else.”  The executive took over after a decline in sales led to
Ericsson’s first full-year  loss  in more than half a century in
2001, prompting the company to sell 30 billion kronor ($4.4
billion) in stock and cut its workforce to restore earnings.
Ericsson said on Oct. 22 that third-quarter  net income  jumped
almost fivefold from a year earlier.  “The best accomplishment was probably to navigate Ericsson
out of the crisis in 2002,” Treschow said. “At that time we
had to go from 110,000 employees to 40,000  employees  in about
two years time. To be able to do that without actually dying in
the process was the biggest achievement in my time.”  Stock Declines  Ericsson  fell  as much as 0.9 krona, or 1.1 percent, to 73.8
kronor and was down 1 percent as of 11:32 a.m. in Stockholm
trading. That pared the stock’s gain this year to 12 percent,
valuing the company at 241 billion kronor.  Treschow, who is a member of Ericsson’s nomination
committee, declined to comment on who may replace him. Treschow
also said has no plans to leave the chairmanship of London- and
Rotterdam-based  Unilever Plc , the world’s second-largest
consumer goods maker, a post he has held since 2007.  Immediately before joining Ericsson, Treschow was chief
executive officer of Electrolux AB. He was CEO of Atlas Copco
AB, the world’s largest maker of air compressor and rock drills,
from 1991 until moving to the Electrolux post in 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
