The cabin crew of Finnair Oyj,
Finland’s biggest airline, will continue their strike after
today rejecting a mediation proposal by state conciliator Esa
Lonka, state-owned broadcaster YLE reported.  The strike, which has lasted for seven days, will be
broadened from tomorrow when “several” other unions join the
strike, YLE said without giving details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
