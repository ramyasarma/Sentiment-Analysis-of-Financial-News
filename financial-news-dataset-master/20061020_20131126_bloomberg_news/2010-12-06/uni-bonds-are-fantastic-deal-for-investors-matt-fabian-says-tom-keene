Municipal bonds are a “fantastic
deal” after the recent sell-off, said  Matt Fabian , managing
director of Municipal Market Advisors.  “Buy them now, absolutely, buy them now,” Fabian said
today during a television interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “If you’re looking for income,
and most investors are, this is an opportunity.”  States and local governments are set to sell about $12.6
billion in debt this week, including $4.2 billion in Build
America Bonds, both the highest in  three weeks,  according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Build America program, scheduled
to expire Dec. 31, provides a 35 percent federal interest-rate
subsidy to issuers.  Investors have been concerned by headlines referring to
budget woes and that has “split the market in half,” said
Fabian, whose research firm is based in Concord, Massachusetts.
As a result, they are left with two options: high-yield, high-
risk bonds such as California’s and low-yield, low-risk
securities in AAA rated states such as Utah.  “I think that munis are a fantastic deal,” Fabian said.
“Muni buyers are income buyers and don’t buy when there’s no
income but right now there is.”  With supply surging, average yields on the bonds  climbed  to
6.26 percent on Dec. 3, the highest since April 8, according to
the Wells Fargo Build America Bond index.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
