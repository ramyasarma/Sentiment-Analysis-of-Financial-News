Russia may more than quadruple
natural-gas production in the Far East region within a decade,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said.  Regional output of the fuel may reach as much as 100
billion cubic meters a year by 2020, from about 22 billion cubic
meters now, Putin said today at a conference in Khabarovsk, near
the Chinese border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
