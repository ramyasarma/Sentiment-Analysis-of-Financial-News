China, the world’s fastest-growing
major economy, will meet its year-end energy conservation
targets, said Zhao Jiarong, a deputy secretary general at the
National Development and Reform Commission.  The country will meet its goal of cutting energy
consumption per unit of gross domestic product between 2006 and
2010 “on time,” Zhao said at a forum in Beijing on Dec 3.  China aims to reduce energy intensity by 20 percent in the
five years ending this month. Energy use per unit of GDP fell
about 3 percent in the first nine months after the government
took steps to curb consumption, including shutting factories,
Zhao said.  The nation will “fully reform” its resources tax during
the five years from 2011, and will set up a trading system for
energy conservation, according to the  transcript  of Zhao’s
speech posted on the NDRC’s website today. She didn’t give more
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
