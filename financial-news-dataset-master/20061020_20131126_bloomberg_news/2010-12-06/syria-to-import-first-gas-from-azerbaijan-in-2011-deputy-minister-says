Syria will start importing natural
gas from Azerbaijan next year, under a new agreement between the
two nations, Syrian Deputy Minister of Oil Hasan Zainab said.  Syria will import about 3.5 million cubic meters of gas a
day, Zainab said in a telephone interview from Damascus today.
Syria and Azerbaijan signed a final agreement on technical
details of the purchase during a visit by Syrian oil officials
to Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital, on Nov. 23.  Zainab expects imports to start by the end of 2011, though
the exact date would depend on the completion of a pipeline
between Syria and Turkey, through which the gas would be
shipped, he said.  Infrastructure work on the Syrian portion of the pipeline
is set for completion in March, while Turkey is due to
finish preparations on its side of the border by the end of
2011, Zainab said. The pipeline would add to a regional network
connecting Syria with Turkey, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Iran, Egypt,
Lebanon, Jordan and Europe.  Syria currently imports around 1.5 million cubic meters of
gas a day, all of it from Egypt, Zainab said.  The government expects to boost its production of both gas
and oil this year and has raised its estimated gas reserves, Oil
Minister  Sufian Alao  said on Nov. 22 in Damascus. He did not
provide figures or details.  Syria had proven oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels at the
end of 2009 and is the smallest gas holder among the nine Middle
Eastern countries listed in BP Plc’s statistical review for last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
