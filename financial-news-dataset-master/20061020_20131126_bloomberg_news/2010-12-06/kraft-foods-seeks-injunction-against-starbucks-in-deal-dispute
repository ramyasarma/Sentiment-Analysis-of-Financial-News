Kraft Foods Inc.  sued  Starbucks Corp. 
seeking to enforce an agreement the foodmaker claims gives it
exclusive rights to sell Starbucks coffee in grocery stores
through 2014.  Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, claims in its
complaint that Starbucks has decided to take over the business
of selling roasted whole bean and ground coffee to grocery
stores. The company asked a federal court in White Plains, New
York, to stop the world’s biggest coffee-shop chain from
breaking the agreement until its case can be heard.  In 12 years, “Kraft has grown the sales of Starbucks
consumer packaged goods products tenfold, increasing annual
revenue from approximately $50 million to approximately $500
million,” according to the complaint.  Starbucks, with $10.7 billion in  sales  last fiscal year,
plans to buy companies to build up its grocery business, Chief
Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said Dec. 1.  “Starbucks has repeatedly said that we have terminated our
agreement with Kraft and we continue to look forward to assuming
full responsibility for the sales” as of March 1, the company
said in a statement. Seattle-based Starbucks called the lawsuit
a “delaying tactic.”  The case is Kraft Foods Global Inc. v. Starbucks Corp., 10-
cv-09085, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
