Liverpool last night beat Aston Villa
3-0, winning its fourth home Premier League match in a row to
climb to two places to eighth in England’s top soccer division.  David Ngog  scored with a header after 14 minutes at Anfield
and  Ryan Babel  doubled the home team’s advantage two minutes
later with a shot into the corner of the net. Argentina
midfielder  Maxi Rodriguez  got the last goal in the 55th minute
with a shot into the top corner.  Former Liverpool manager  Gerard Houllier ’s Villa team has
now won once in 10 league games. The Birmingham club is 16th in
the 20-team standings with 17 points, two more than Wigan, which
occupies the last of the division’s three relegation positions.  Liverpool has 22 points from 16 of 38 games, 10 points
fewer than leader Arsenal. Since losing 2-1 to Blackpool on Oct.
3, the team defeated Blackburn, Chelsea, West Ham and now Villa.  Liverpool striker  Fernando Torres  missed the game when his
wife went into labor with their second child, while team captain
 Steven Gerrard  and central defender  Jamie Carragher  were
sidelined with injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
