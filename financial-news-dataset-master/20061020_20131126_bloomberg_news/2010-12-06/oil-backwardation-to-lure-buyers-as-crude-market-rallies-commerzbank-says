The prospect of backwardation in oil
markets, in which earlier-delivery futures trade above contracts
for later supply, is likely to lure investors as prices rise,
according to Commerzbank AG.  “The present shape of the forward curve suggests further
tightening on the crude oil market,” a team of analysts
including Frankfurt-based  Carsten Fritsch  wrote in a report
today. “This backwardation, which was rarely evident in the
past few years, is likely to bring more buyers into the arena.”  Oil for January delivery was trading at a discount, or
contango, of 35 cents to February futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 6:53 a.m. local time. That’s the
lowest discount since August, based on closing prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
