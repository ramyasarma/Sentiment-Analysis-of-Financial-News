European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Nout Wellink  said it is not the central bank’s
task to rescue euro-area countries with funding problems.  “It’s not up to the ECB to save countries where
governments run the risk of becoming insolvent,” Wellink, who
also heads the Dutch central bank, said at a panel discussion in
Amsterdam today. “We are not here to take over, on our balance
sheet, the risks of the national economies of Europe.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB wants governments to take the lead
in quelling the turmoil that threatens to spread to other
countries from Ireland and Greece. Last week the central bank
snapped up Portuguese and Irish bonds after ECB President  Jean- Claude Trichet  assured investors that policy makers will delay
the withdrawal of emergency liquidity.  Wellink said today he’s “not in favor” of a joint euro-
area bond because it would weaken the financial system as it is
“a hidden way of burden sharing.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , who heads Europe’s largest
economy, also rejects the common bonds and reiterated in Berlin
that she opposes adding to the rescue fund for indebted nations.  Separately, Wellink said the price of gold “has increased
excessively.”  Gold futures for February delivery jumped today to a record
$1,429.40 an ounce on concern the U.S. will pump more cash into
the economy and Europe’s debt woes will spread, boosting the
appeal of the metal as an alternative to currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
