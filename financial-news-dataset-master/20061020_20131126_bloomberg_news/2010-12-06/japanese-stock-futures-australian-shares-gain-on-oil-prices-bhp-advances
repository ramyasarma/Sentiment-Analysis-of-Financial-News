Japanese  stock   futures  and Australian
shares advanced after oil and metal prices gained on speculation
the U.S. may extend stimulus measures, bolstering demand for
commodities.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s
biggest commodities trader, gained 0.1 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Toyota Motor Corp., the No. 1
carmaker worldwide, declined 0.1 percent after the yen
strengthened against the dollar. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
No. 1 mining company and Australia’s biggest oil producer,
climbed 0.7 percent in Sydney today.  “Commodity markets are firm, which may boost resource-
related companies, but concerns about the strong yen may weaken
exporters. The market overall is likely to become
conglutinate,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-
based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 10,185 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,180 in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,190 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.2 percent as of 8:03 a.m. in Tokyo today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.3 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index fell 0.1 percent, snapping a three-day
rally, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
world’s largest economy may need more stimulus.  Commodities Advance  Crude oil for January delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $89.38 a barrel in New York yesterday on speculation the U.S.
may extend stimulus measures, bolstering fuel demand in the
world’s largest oil-consuming country, and on cold-weather
forecasts for the U.S. and Europe.  Crude extended its longest advance in four weeks after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed may expand
bond purchases beyond the $600 billion announced last month.
Winter weather in parts of the U.S. and Europe boosted demand
for heating fuel.  Copper futures for delivery in March rose 0.2 percent in
New York, after reaching the highest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 12.  The Baltic Dry Index  of shipping costs for
commodities gained 1.6 percent yesterday, rising for a second
day.  Gold futures jumped to a record $1,429.40 an ounce on
concern the U.S. will pump more cash into the economy and
Europe’s debt woes will spread, boosting the appeal of the metal
as an alternative to currencies.  Stronger Yen  The yen appreciated to as high as 109.91 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 110.60 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 82.67 from 82.86. A stronger yen reduces
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 9.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 6.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
