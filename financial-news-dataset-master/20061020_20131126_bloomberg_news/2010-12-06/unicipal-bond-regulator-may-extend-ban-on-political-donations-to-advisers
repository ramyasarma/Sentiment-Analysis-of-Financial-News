The U.S. municipal-bond market
regulator wants to bar financial advisers for state and local
governments from making political contributions to clients, a
step aimed at keep donations from being used to win business.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which gained
power over the previously unregulated advisers under this year’s
 Dodd-Frank  financial-system overhaul, will propose rules
covering donations that are similar to those for bond
underwriters, said  Michael Bartolotta , the board’s chairman.
Since 1994, underwriters have been barred from contributing to
the politicians with whom they work.  “Putting similar rules in place for the advisory community
is one of our top priorities,” Bartolotta, who is also the vice
chairman of Dallas-based First Southwest Co., told reporters on
a conference call today.  The board is  beginning to craft  the regulations for firms
that advise local officials when they raise money in the $2.8
trillion municipal-bond market, invest the proceeds or enter
into derivative trades with Wall Street banks tied to the
financing.  The Securities and Exchange Commission reviews and approves
rules made by the board, which is an industry self-regulatory
organization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
