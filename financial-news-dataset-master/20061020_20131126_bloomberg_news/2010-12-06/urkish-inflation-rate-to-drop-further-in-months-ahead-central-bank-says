Turkish consumer price inflation will
slow further in the coming months, the central bank said.  Inflation in November, which slowed to 7.3 percent from 8.6
percent a month earlier, confirmed the Ankara-based lender’s
forecasts of a slowdown, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  Lower food prices were the main factor in November’s
performance, the bank said today. Core inflation measures may
start to show “limited” increases in the months ahead, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
