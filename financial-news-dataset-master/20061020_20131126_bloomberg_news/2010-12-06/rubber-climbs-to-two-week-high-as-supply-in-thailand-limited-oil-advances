Rubber climbed to a three-week high
after a rally in oil raised the appeal of the commodity as an
alternative to synthetic products used in tires and tight supply
boosted the Thai cash price to a record.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange gained
as much as 2.3 percent to 378.8 yen per kilogram ($4,569 a
metric ton) before settling at 378 yen. The price climbed to the
highest level since Nov. 11, when a most-active contract reached
a 30-year high of 383 yen.  Oil advanced to the highest in 26 months in New York amid
optimism fuel demand will increase. Physical rubber prices in
Thailand, the biggest producer and exporter, increased to a
record on Dec. 3 on a supply shortage, according to the  Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand . Futures also gained on
expectation the Federal Reserve may take more steps to boost
economic growth.  “Rubber chased a rally in oil and metals as investor
demand for commodities increased amid speculation over U.S.
monetary easing,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at Tokyo-based
broker Fujitomi Co., said today by phone. “Futures were also
supported by the strength of physical rubber prices.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S.
unemployment may take five years to return to a normal level and
that Fed purchases of Treasury securities beyond the $600
billion announced last month are possible.  Bernanke Comments  “At the rate we’re going, it could be four, five years
before we are back to a more normal unemployment rate” of about
5 to 6 percent, Bernanke said according to the transcript of an
interview aired today on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program.  Bernanke and other Fed officials have defended the central
bank’s announcement that it will purchase $75 billion in
Treasury securities a month through June to prop up a recovery
so weak that only 39,000 jobs were created in November.  Oil for January delivery added as much as 0.6 percent to
$89.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest since October 2008, before trading at
$89.69 at 4:53 p.m. Tokyo time. Higher oil boosts the cost of
making synthetic rubber.  The  cash rubber price  in Thailand climbed to a record
134.05 baht ($4.46) per kilogram on Dec. 3, according to the
 Rubber Research Institute of Thailand . Demand remained strong
amid a supply shortage as rain persists in southern Thailand,
the institute said. Thailand’s south accounts for 80 percent of
output. The Thai market was closed today for a holiday.  Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s largest tiremaker, plans to
raise Japanese prices of truck and bus tires by an average of 7
percent after rubber and petrochemical costs increased. The
changes will take effect March 1, the company said in a
statement on its website today.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai added 1.5 percent to 32,835
yuan ($4,939) a ton. It reached a record 38,920 yuan on Nov. 11.  China’s natural-rubber  inventories  dropped for the first
time in 10 weeks, declining 6,665 tons to 55,346 tons, based on
a survey of 10 warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan
and Tianjin, the bourse said on Dec. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
