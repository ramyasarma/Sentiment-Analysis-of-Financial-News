Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s larger maker of luxury vehicles, is increasing hiring as
the company expands its lineup to meet environmental regulators’
demand for cleaner-running cars.  The manufacturer plans to add 1,300 employees this year and
at least 1,300 in 2011,  Michael Rebstock , a spokesman at Munich-
based BMW, said today by phone. The maker of BMW, Mini and
Rolls-Royce models aims to add expertise in electric vehicles,
hybrid powertrains and cleaner combustion engines to develop
models with lower carbon-dioxide emissions, he said.  BMW scaled back the workforce through buyouts and early
retirement programs to 96,230  employees  at the end of 2009 from
107,539 in 2007 after Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer 
initiated a cost-cutting drive to boost  profitability . The
company is developing an electric city car and a hybrid-powered
sports car for introduction in 2013.  The company took on about 1,000 new workers on average in
2008 and 2009, Rebstock said. In addition to research and
development employees, BMW is recruiting purchasing and sales
specialists, he said.  The automaker is seeking to increase sales this year by
about 10 percent to more than 1.4 million deliveries, with
further growth to 2 million deliveries by 2020.  Daimler’s Rastatt Plant  Other German automakers are also hiring.  Daimler AG  added
400 workers this year at its factory in Rastatt, Germany, where
it builds Mercedes-Benz A- and B-Class compacts, said  Nicole Kicherer , a spokeswoman at the Stuttgart-based manufacturer.
Mercedes-Benz also intends to hire 2,500 more employees at a new
small-car plant in Hungary.  Volkswagen AG , which owns the Audi luxury brand, may create
50,000 jobs globally by 2015, with about 10 percent of the
positions in Germany, its second-biggest market after China,
Personnel Chief  Horst Neumann  told Handelsblatt newspaper in an
interview confirmed by  Stefan Ohletz , a spokesman at the
Wolfsburg-based carmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
