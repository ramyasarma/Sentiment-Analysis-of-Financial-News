Most Asian  stocks  rose, led by
commodity-related companies, after Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the U.S. Federal Reserve may buy more bonds to boost growth,
countering falls by Japan’s exporters.  Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, climbed
2.4 percent in Hong Kong after oil and metal prices gained.
Mitsui & Co., which counts commodities as its largest source of
profit, increased 1.5 percent in Tokyo. Riversdale Mining Ltd.
surged 16 percent after the company said Rio Tinto Group made a
takeover proposal.  Canon Inc. , the world’s largest camera maker,
led Japanese exporters lower, falling as much as 1.7 percent as
a stronger yen versus the dollar damped its earnings outlook.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  was little changed at 133.46 at
7:34 p.m. in Tokyo. About five stocks rose for every four that
fell. Stocks slid 0.6 percent last month, ending two consecutive
months of gains, as concern grew that China’s anti-inflation
measures, Europe’s debt crisis and rising tensions on the Korean
peninsula may cool the global economic recovery.  “If the Fed were to do more quantitative easing after the
implementation of the $600 billion which has already been
announced, then that suggests liquidity will remain abundant,
and that’s a positive contributor to the stock market,” said
 Khiem Do , the Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy
at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees about $12
billion. “It seems that some of the negative macro factors in
the month of November have eased. That’s why the markets have
been able to bounce back up.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 0.4 percent, reversing
an earlier 1.3 percent gain. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
fell 0.1 percent, while the broader Topix index rose 0.3 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi Index slid 0.2 percent and Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.1 percent.  Energy, Metals  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.3 percent
today. The index climbed 0.3 percent on Dec. 3 in New York as a
rally by energy and metals producers offset concern that slower-
than-estimated growth in payrolls will hamper an economic
recovery.  U.S. unemployment may take five years to fall to a normal
level and Fed purchases of Treasury securities beyond the $600
billion announced last month are possible, Fed chairman Bernanke
said in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes program that aired in
the U.S. Sunday night.  “The message that the U.S. will continue its easing policy
until the economy recovers is leading to speculation that excess
liquidity will continue to support the market,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund manager in Tokyo who helps oversee $6 billion
at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  Energy, Materials  A measure of energy and materials related companies  rose
the most  among the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups.  Cnooc gained 2.4 percent to HK$18.16. Mitsui & Co., a
Japanese trading company, gained 1.5 percent to 1,361 yen. In
Sydney,  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s second-biggest oil
and gas producer, climbed 1.1 percent to A$42.68.  Crude oil rose to its highest level in 26 months in New
York. The January delivery contract added as much as 41 cents to
$89.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest since Oct. 7, 2008, and was at $89.54 at
10:17 a.m. Sydney time. Copper increased for a fifth day, headed
for it longest rally since July.  Riversdale Surges  Riversdale Mining Ltd. jumped 16 percent to A$16.31, the
 biggest increase  on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index. The company,
which is developing coal mines in Africa, said Rio Tinto, the
world’s third-biggest miner, made an initial A$3.5 billion
($3.47 billion) takeover offer. Rio decreased 0.5 percent to
A$86.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has climbed about 11 percent
this year through Dec. 3, compared with gains of 9.8 percent by
the S&P 500 and 6.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Shares in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500
and 12.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Asia Pacific gauge rose 3.5 percent last week, ending
three consecutive weeks of declines, as U.S. reports showed
consumer confidence rose to the highest level in five months in
November and claims for jobless benefits over the past month on
average dropped to a two-year low.  Today, the  MSCI Asia Pacific Consumer Discretionary Index ,
which includes Canon, Honda Motor Co. and Panasonic Corp. as its
members, slid 0.2 percent, the most among the 10 industry groups
on the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index.  Consumer Stocks  Canon, which receives more than 80 percent of its revenue
outside of Japan, slid 1 percent to 4,070 yen.  Honda , which
counts North America as its biggest market, dropped 0.6 percent
to 3,135 yen. Panasonic, the world’s largest maker of plasma
televisions, declined 1.2 percent to 1,191 yen.  The dollar tumbled on Dec. 3 after U.S. Labor Department
figures showed payrolls increased by 39,000 last month, less
than the most pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Unemployment held near a 26-year high.  The dollar traded at 82.84 yen today in Tokyo, near its
lowest level in three weeks. A weaker dollar reduces the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency.  “The dollar’s weakness against the yen on the backdrop of
a slow U.S. jobs recovery will weigh on some of the Japanese
exporters,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc.  Among other stocks that fell today,  Sigma Pharmaceuticals
Ltd.  tumbled 17 percent to 40.5 Australian cents in Sydney after
saying it expects annual wholesale revenue to drop by as much as
15 percent from February 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
