Hyprop Investments Ltd. , a South
African real-estate investor, agreed to buy Attfund Retail for
8.99 billion rand ($1.3 billion) to add shopping malls.  Hyprop will make the purchase with cash and stock and plans
to issue 112 million shares at 54 rand each, the Johannesburg-
based company said in a stock exchange statement today. The
price includes the assumption of debt.  “Hyprop may be paying too much,” Thabo Motloung, an
analyst at Old Mutual Investment Group in Cape Town, said by
telephone. Attfund Retail’s shopping centers are in mature areas
and are likely to grow no faster than the rest of the property
market, “so you don’t want to pay a premium,” he said.  Attfund Retail, which is changing its name from Femtoworx
Ltd., owns properties including Atterbury Value Mart and
Woodlands Boulevard in Pretoria and the Clearwater Mall and
Lifestyle Centre in western Johannesburg.  Redefine Properties Ltd. , Hyprop’s largest shareholder,
will be paid a 130 million-rand transaction fee by Attfund
Retail shareholders as part of the deal. The payment will be
made from the cash portion of the settlement price, it said.  Hyprop shares rose 1.7 rand, or 3 percent, to close at 56
rand in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
