Britain will urge European Union
member states to reject a proposed extension of maternity rights
that would entitle new mothers to 20 weeks’ full pay, saying the
step would cost the U.K. 2 billion pounds ($3 billion) a year.  Business Minister  Ed Davey  will travel to Brussels today to
meet his EU counterparts and discuss the recommendation from the
European Parliament. His office said he will argue that it would
prevent Britain from implementing its own measures just as EU
countries are trying to grow after the recession.  “Minimum standards across Europe are important, but
countries also need the flexibility to put in place arrangements
that work for them in their own individual circumstances,”
Davey said in an e-mailed statement. “We are absolutely
committed to creating the best possible family-friendly
environment in the U.K., but the solutions on the table today
are not the best way to help.”  British women are already entitled to 39 weeks of statutory
maternity pay. They receive 90 percent of their average wage for
the first six weeks and 125 pounds a week for the remaining 33
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
