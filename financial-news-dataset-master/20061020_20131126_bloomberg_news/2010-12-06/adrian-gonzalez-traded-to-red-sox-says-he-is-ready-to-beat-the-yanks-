(Corrects Gonzalez’s stay in San Diego, in sixth
paragraph.)  Adrian Gonzalez  joined the Boston Red
Sox today and immediately said he was “ready to beat the
Yanks.”  The 28-year-old first baseman, who has hit 30 home runs in
each of the last four Major League Baseball seasons, was traded
to the Red Sox from the San Diego Padres for three minor
leaguers and a player to be named.  Gonzalez will earn $6.2 million next season in the final
year of his contract, and the Red Sox are confident that they
will agree on an extension before he becomes a free agent in
2011, the team said on  its website .  “I’m very excited to be here in Boston and ready to beat
the Yanks,” Gonzalez said on the website.  The Red Sox failed to make the playoffs last season for the
first time since 2006, finishing third in the American League
East behind the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston’s biggest rival, the
New York Yankees.  Gonzalez was the No. 1 pick in the 2000 draft and spent his
past five seasons with the Padres. The three-time All-Star and
two-time gold Glove winner hit .298 with 31 home runs and 101
runs batted in last season.  The Red Sox scored 818 runs and hit 211 homers in 2010,
both second-most in the American League. The Red Sox, plagued by
injuries to 2008 AL Most Valuable Player  Dustin Pedroia  and All-
Stars  Josh Beckett ,  Kevin Youkilis  and  Mike Cameron , finished
89-73 last season, seven games behind the Rays in the AL East.  The Padres receive pitcher Casey Kelly, outfielder Raymond
Fuentes and first baseman  Anthony Rizzo  in the deal. The three
players were ranked No. 2, No. 7 and No. 8 on Baseball America’s
list of Boston’s t op 10 prospects  last December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
