Dollar General Corp. , the biggest of
the U.S. dollar discount stores, had a record decline in New
York trading after reporting slowing growth in same-store sales.  Sales by stores open at least 13 months rose 4.2 percent
in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, the Goodlettsville,
Tennessee-based operator of 9,273 discount stores said today in
a statement. That slowed from growth of 5.1 percent in the
second quarter and 6.7 percent a quarter earlier.  Dollar General, which competes against  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
and drugstore chain Walgreen Co., faced “a highly promotional
retail environment,” Chief Executive Officer  Rick Dreiling  told
analysts on a conference call. He predicted consumers will delay
most holiday purchases until late in the season.  Dollar General  tumbled  $2.44, or 7.3 percent, to $30.99 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
drop since the stock started trading in November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
