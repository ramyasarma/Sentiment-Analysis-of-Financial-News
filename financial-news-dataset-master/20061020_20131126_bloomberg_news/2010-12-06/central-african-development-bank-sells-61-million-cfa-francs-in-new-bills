The  Development Bank of Central
African States  is selling its first treasury bills this month,
with a plan to raise 30 billion CFA francs ($60.6 million) to
fund projects in its six member nations.  The seven-year notes will be offered until Dec. 29 at an
interest rate of 5.5 percent, said Basile Tchakounte, director
of the finance department of the Economic and Monetary Union of
Central Africa, in a statement handed to reporters in Yaounde,
 Cameroon’s  capital, today.  The notes will be listed on stock exchanges in Libreville,
the capital of Gabon, and Douala, in Cameroon’s main port city,
Tchakounte said. The Brazzaville-based bank funds infrastructure
projects including roads, energy generation and
telecommunications, according to its website.  The sale is open to residents of the bank’s member
countries, which include Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo and Chad.  To contact the reporter on this story
