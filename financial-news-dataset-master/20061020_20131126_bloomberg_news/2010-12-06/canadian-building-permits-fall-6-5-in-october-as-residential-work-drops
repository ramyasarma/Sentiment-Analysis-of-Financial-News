Canadian  building permits  declined in
October, as single-family projects declined for the sixth time
in the last seven months, government figures showed.  The total value of permits issued by municipalities
decreased 6.5 percent to C$6.16 billion ($6.13 billion),
“comparable to levels prior to the economic downturn,”
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists predicted a 4
percent decrease based on the median of 13 responses to a
Bloomberg News survey.  Canada’s economic growth slowed to a less-than-expected
third-quarter  annualized pace  of 1 percent, in part because of
slower housing activity, Statistics Canada said last week. The
Bank of Canada says housing will be a drag on growth in 2011
after it helped lead the country out of a recession last year.  Residential permits decreased 11.2 percent to C$3.42
billion, Statistics Canada said. Single-family permits fell 9.4
percent to C$2.02 billion and multiple-unit structures dropped
13.6 percent to C$1.4 billion.  Permits for non-residential construction  rose 0.1 percent
to C$2.74 billion in October.  Commercial projects rose 8.8 percent to C$1.65 billion, the
highest since May 2008. Institutional permits fell 20.4 percent
to C$685 million, following a 23.7 percent increase in
September.  By province, Ontario and Quebec led declines in both
residential and non-residential projects, the report said.  The total value of building permits for October was 1.1
percent lower than the year-ago month, the report said.  Statistics Canada also revised its estimate for the
September advance in building permits to 14.9 percent from the
originally reported 15.3 percent rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
