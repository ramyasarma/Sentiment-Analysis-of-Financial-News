Kabel Deutschland Holding AG ,
started syndicating a six-year 400 million-euro ($535 million)
term loan to repay its junior ranking senior notes.  Germany’s largest cable-television operator will repay
226 million euros of its 10.75 percent notes due in 2014 and
$145 million of its 10.625 percent notes due in 2014, the
Unterfoehring, Germany-based company said in a  statement . This
will result in savings of about 20 million euros per year.  Kabel Deutschland  said  on Dec. 3 it completed an amendment
to its 2 billion-euro senior credit facility which will allow it
to increase senior debt, cut junior-ranked borrowings and make
dividend payments. It already agreed to repay $465 million of
its 10.625 percent bonds due 2014 by Dec. 17.  The new loan will pay interest at 4 percentage points over
benchmark rates, two people familiar with the transaction said.
It will be offered at a discount of 99.5 of face value.  A call with potential investors will take place on Dec. 7
and the company expects commitments for the new loan by Dec. 10,
said the people, who didn’t want to be identified because the
deal is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
