Japan’s  bonds  declined, lifting 30-
year yields the most in more than two weeks, as demand fell at
an auction of the securities today.  Longer-term bonds led the retreat as the bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the number of bids to
the amount of securities sold, dropped to 2.95 from 5.4 at the
previous auction. The Ministry of Finance auctioned 600 billion
yen ($7.27 billion) of 30-year debt today and will sell 1.1
trillion yen of 20-year bonds on Dec. 14.  “There may be some concern about the 20-year debt auction
after the result of today’s sales,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a
senior economist in Tokyo at Okasan Securities Co. “Because of
the amount issued, the auction next week draws attention.”
Okasan is one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt sales.  The yield on the 30-year bond jumped six basis points to
2:19 percent as of 4:05 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 2 percent security
due September 2040, lost 1.056 yen to 96.575 yen. The increase
in yield was the most since Nov. 18.  The 20-year yield climbed four basis points to 2.04 percent
and the benchmark 10-year  rate  rose one basis point to 1.17
percent. Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped
0.27 to 141.21 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  At today’s auction, the lowest accepted price was 96.4,
compared with the 96.6 estimated by traders in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Bonds also slumped after a private survey showed more U.S
employers plan to boost payrolls at the start of 2011, easing
concern demand for Japanese-made products will shrink in the
country.  U.S. Jobs  Milwaukee-based Manpower Inc., the world’s second-largest
provider of temporary workers, said today its employment gauge
for January through March 2011 rose to the highest level in more
than two years.  The U.S. was Japan’s second-biggest export market after
China by the value of products shipped during the six months
ended September, according to Japan’s Ministry of Finance.  The decline in bonds was tempered on speculation a widening
 yield spread  between 10-year and two-year debt will attract
investors to the longer-maturity securities. The yield premium
investors demand to hold 10-year bonds instead of two-year notes
has widened to 99 basis points from a low of 72.5 basis points
on Oct. 6.  “Ten-year bonds are increasingly undervalued,” said
Okasan’s Bandou.  To contact the reporters on this story:
