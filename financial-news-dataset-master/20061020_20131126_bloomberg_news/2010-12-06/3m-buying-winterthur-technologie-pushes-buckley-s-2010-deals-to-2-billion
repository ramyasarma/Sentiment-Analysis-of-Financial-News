3M Co.’s  agreement to purchase
grinding-tools maker  Winterthur Technologie AG  brings the
company’s spending on acquisitions this year to at least $2
billion, the highest in a decade.  Chief Executive Officer  George Buckley  has funneled money
into acquisitions in 2010 as 3M adds to its health-care,
security and industrial operations. The company has spent at
least $6.47 billion since 2001, based on Bloomberg analysis of
deals whose terms were disclosed. The previous high was $1.42
billion in 2007, data show.  The $448 million takeover of Switzerland’s Winterthur will
enhance 3M’s position in the $14 billion market for abrasives,
the company said today. The 13 percent premium is less than the
average 15 percent that St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M paid in
deals this year, data show.  Winterthur “fits with the roots of 3M,”  Jeff Windau , a
St. Louis-based analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said in a
telephone interview. “It gives them reach with these products
into some other markets, especially internationally.”  Winterthur  employs about 1,300 workers and posted sales in
the first half of about $114 million, an increase of more than
30 percent from a year earlier, according to 3M’s statement. The
purchase will “slightly” hurt earnings in the first 12 months
after the deal’s completion, 3M said.  Abrasives Market  “Adding  Winterthur  enhances and extends our existing
product line, enabling us to provide solutions for a broader
range of industrial grinding and finishing needs,” Chris
Holmes, general manager of 3M Abrasive Systems, said in the
statement. 3M projects the abrasives market will grow more than
4 percent a year amid demand for hard-to-grind and high-
precision materials.  Winterthur’s purchase price is about twice its yearly
revenue, compared with a median multiple of 0.73 paid for
machine tools and products companies in more than 150 deals
worldwide in the past five years, analysis of Bloomberg data
shows. The average premium was 22 percent.  The acquisition is the third-largest among machine-tools
companies since 2005, and 3M said it should be completed in the
first quarter. Winterthur Chairman  Edgar Rappold  has agreed to
tender his 14 percent holding, and the offer is conditional upon
a tendering of two-thirds of the shares, for which 3M offered 62
francs each.  “We view this transaction positively,” Mathew Christy, an
analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said in a note to clients. It
will “help bolster 3M’s leading position” in abrasives, he
said.  Christy has a “hold” rating on the shares, while Windau
has assigned a “buy”  rating .  3M , whose purchases this year include fingerprint-
identification systems maker Cogent Inc., fell 6 cents to $86.88
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange  composite trading .  Winterthur, based in Zug, Switzerland,  climbed  6.9 percent
to 62 francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The shares have gained
52 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
