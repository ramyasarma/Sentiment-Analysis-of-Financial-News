The Boston Red Sox completed a trade
with the San Diego Padres for All-Star first baseman  Adrian Gonzalez ,  ESPN reported , citing an unidentified person familiar
with the situation.  The Red Sox will hold a news conference today to announce
the deal, although they’ve broken off talks with Gonzalez on a
long-term contract, ESPN said. Gonzalez, who had right shoulder
Oct. 20, is seeking a contract similar to  Mark Teixeira ’s
eight-year, $180 million deal with the New York Yankees and the
Red Sox are offering six years and $120 million, ESPN said.  The Padres will receive three minor-league prospects from
the Red Sox for Gonzalez, who had one year left on his contract
worth about $6 million. Gonzalez, 28, was the No. 1 pick in the
2000 Major League Baseball draft and spent the past five seasons
playing in his hometown of San Diego.  Gonzalez hit .298 with 31 home runs and 101 runs batted in
for the Padres last season. He’s hit 137 homers over the past
four seasons, including a career-high 40 in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
