Newcastle soccer club fired manager
 Chris Hughton  today as the newly promoted team sits in 11th
place in England’s Premier League.  Hughton, who won the League Managers’ Association’s
 Championship coach of the year award  for last season, is the
first top-division manager to be fired this campaign.  The 51-year-old joined the club as an assistant to  Kevin Keegan  in 2008 after working at Tottenham Hotspur between 1993
and 2007. He stayed on at Newcastle under  Joe Kinnear , taking a
caretaker role when the coach’s health forced him out of the
job. Hughton then took the top post in October 2009 after  Alan Shearer  couldn’t save the club from relegation.  “Regrettably, the board now feels that an individual with
more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward,”
Newcastle said in a  statement  on its website.  Newcastle has won only five of its 16 league games this
season and lost 3-1 at West Brom yesterday. Other recent
results, including a 5-1 win over local rival Sunderland, a 1-0
win at Arsenal and a 1-1 draw with Chelsea, weren’t enough to
keep him in the job.  The team, which also let go goalkeeping coach Paul Barron
today, didn’t say who would replace Hughton.  Hughton was with Spurs as a player for 11 seasons, winning
two F.A. Cups and the UEFA Cup. He played 53 times for Ireland’s
national team, including at the 1988 European Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
