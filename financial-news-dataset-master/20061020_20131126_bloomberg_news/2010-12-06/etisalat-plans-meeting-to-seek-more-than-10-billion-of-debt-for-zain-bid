Emirates Telecommunications Corp. 
plans to meet lenders next week in London to discuss terms on
more than $10 billion of debt to fund its bid for a stake in
Kuwait’s biggest phone operator, three people familiar with the
situation said.  Etisalat, as the United Arab Emirates’ largest phone
company is known, may hold the bank meeting by Dec. 16, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The deal would be the largest acquisition financing by
a company in the Middle East and Africa since at least 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat said on Sept. 30 it offered about
$12 billion for a 46 percent stake in Mobile Telecommunications
Co., or  Zain.   The deal would extend Etisalat’s reach in the Middle East,
where Zain operates in countries from Kuwait and Iraq to
Bahrain. Etisalat offers telecommunications in 18 countries in
the Middle East, Africa and Asia, counting more than 100 million
customers, according to its website. The seven emirates of the
U.A.E make up about 86 percent of Etisalat’s sales.  Ahmed Bin Ali, a spokesman at Etisalat, wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
