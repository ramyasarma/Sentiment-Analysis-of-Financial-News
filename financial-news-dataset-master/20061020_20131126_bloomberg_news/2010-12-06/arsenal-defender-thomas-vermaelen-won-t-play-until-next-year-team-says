Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen
won’t be back in the side until the new year as he recovers from
an Achilles tendon injury, coach Arsene Wenger said.  The player hasn’t played since Belgium’s Euro 2012
qualifying match against Turkey on Sept. 7. The 25-year-old is
wearing a protective boot, and won’t return to the squad before
January, Wenger said in comments on the London soccer team’s
website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
