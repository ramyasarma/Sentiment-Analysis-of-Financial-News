Brazil and the U.S. reached agreement
on a framework for a so-called open skies pact by 2015, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the talks.  Under the agreement, restrictions on the number of flights
between the two countries would be lifted from next year, and
rules on the busiest routes, mainly to Sao Paulo, would be eased
from 2013, the newspaper said.  Brazilian airlines joining global alliances would be immune
from U.S. antitrust law, the WSJ reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
