Fiat SpA  may not reach a labor
agreement for workers at its Mirafiori factory before Christmas,
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said today.  “I’ve got a couple of plan Bs,” Marchionne said at an
event in Michigan. “I don’t mean this as a threat. I have to
run the business. I’m not on someone else’s clock.”  Moving production from the plant in Turin, Italy, to the
U.S. is an option if an agreement isn’t reached, and there are
other possibilities, he said, without describing them.  In November, Fiat said it planned to build cars and sport-
utility vehicles for the Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands at the
Mirafiori plant as part of a joint venture with Chrysler Group
LLC. The talks stalled last week, Marchionne said.  “There is dialogue going on -- I don’t know if I would
call them negotiations,” he told reporters following an event
at a Chrysler factory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
