Clarium LP, the hedge fund run by
PayPal co-founder  Peter Thiel , lost 23 percent this year,
according to a note sent to clients.  The $321 million fund declined 7.8 percent last month,
according to the Dec. 3 note.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for
Thiel’s San Francisco-based Clarium Capital Management LLC,
declined to comment.  Hedge funds declined 1.5 percent last month, the most since
May, leaving the gain for the year at 3.8 percent, according to
the Bloomberg aggregate hedge fund  index .  Clarium, founded by Thiel, 43, in 2002 after selling
online-payments service PayPal to EBay Inc. for $1.5 billion,
trades everything from stocks to commodities, seeking to profit
from broad economic trends, a strategy known as macro investing.
Such funds fell 1.1 percent last month, curbing their annual
gain to 2.1 percent this year, according to Bloomberg data.  Assets at the entire firm have slumped to $681 million
from about $7 billion at the 2008 peak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
