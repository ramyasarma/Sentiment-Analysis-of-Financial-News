-- EDF SA (Electricite de France)
said the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has offered to acquire its
stake in EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG at a price of 41.50
euros per share.  That represents an 18.6 percent premium on the share’s last
closing price, and would value the divested stake at 4.7 billion
euros, EDF said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
