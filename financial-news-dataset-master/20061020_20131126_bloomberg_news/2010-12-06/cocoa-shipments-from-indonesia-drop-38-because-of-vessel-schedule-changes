Cocoa bean exports from Sulawesi,
Indonesia’s main growing region, dropped 38 percent in November
from a month earlier because of limited vessel availability, an
industry group said.  Shipments from the provinces of South and Central Sulawesi
declined to 21,173 metric tons last month, from 33,898 tons in
October, the Indonesia Cocoa Association said in a faxed
statement today. Sales were 33,329 tons in November last year.  “Exports were lower because of changes in shipping
schedules” caused by limited vessels, Herman Agan, head of the
Central Sulawesi branch of the association, said by telephone
from Palu, the provincial capital. “Exports may pick up again
this month, adding delayed shipments from November.”  Falling supplies from Indonesia, the largest producer after
Ivory Coast and Ghana, may help to halt a decline in the prices
of the chocolate ingredient, which have dropped about 11 percent
in New York this year. Sulawesi accounts for about 75 percent of
total output and sales from the Southeast Asian country.  From January to November, overseas sales from the island in
eastern Indonesia declined 2 percent from a year ago to 240,973
tons, the group said.  Cocoa futures for March delivery climbed 2.3 percent to
$2,935 a ton in ICE Futures U.S. in New York on Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
