U.S. natural gas futures traded close
to backwardation whereby front-month prices are at a premium to
the later deliveries, as cold weather boosts demand for the fuel
for immediate delivery.  The gas futures market settled in contango at the end of
last week, whereby prices are higher for later deliveries.
First- and second-month natural gas futures last settled in
backwardation on July 28, and have occasionally been in
backwardation in intraday trading in late November.  Gas for January delivery at the Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, traded a $4.441 a million British thermal units while
the February contract was at $4.444 in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 8:56 a.m. local time.  The difference between the first and second month contracts
narrowed to zero earlier today, according to spread transactions
on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
