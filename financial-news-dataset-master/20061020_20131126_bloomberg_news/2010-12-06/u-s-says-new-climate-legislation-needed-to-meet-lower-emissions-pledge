The U.S. pledge to cut greenhouse gas
emissions about 17 percent depends in part on congressional
legislation, Todd Stern, the head of the nation’s delegation at
United Nations climate talks, said today.  The U.S. made the commitment to cut emissions in the range
of 17 percent by 2020 earlier this year as part of a non-binding
international accord aimed at combating climate change. The U.S.
said at the time that the goal depends on congressional
legislation.   “We will certainly need to do that with some legislative
component,” Stern said at a press conference at the climate
talks in Cancun, Mexico.  The comment is the strongest signal yet that President
Barack Obama’s administration believes it needs to pass rules in
congress to make good on the nation’s carbon reduction promises.
A bill aimed at curbing those emissions stalled in the Senate
earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
