Investors should buy cyclical stocks
and companies with high return on equity such as Oracle Corp.
and Visa Inc. as the U.S. economy expands and stocks rally next
year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Economic growth, low inflation and interest rates near zero
create a “superb environment” for stocks, Goldman investment
strategist  David Kostin  wrote in a note dated Dec. 3. Cyclical
industries such financial services, technology and energy will
gain from the strong economic outlook and an 18 percent jump in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in 2011, the strategist said.  “Fund managers should own stocks leveraged to the
accelerating U.S. economy,” Kostin wrote. “The stock market
will re-rate growth when it becomes convinced the expansion is
durable. Fund managers should be there first.”  Stocks that are leveraged so that they will benefit more
than other equities from higher economic growth and a rise in
the stock market -- so-called dual-beta stocks -- will jump,
said Kostin, who also recommended  Juniper Networks Inc. , the
second-largest networking-equipment provider after Cisco Systems
Inc.; Broadcom Corp.; Qualcomm Inc.;  Nasdaq OMX Inc. , Baxter
International Inc., Eaton Corp. and  Hasbro Inc. , the world’s
second-largest toymaker.  Kostin said last week that he estimates the S&P 500 will
end next year at 1,450, up 18 percent from the close on Dec. 3.
The strategist forecast combined earnings per share for S&P 500
companies of $84 in 2010, $94 next year and $104 in 2012 in a
report dated Dec. 1.  Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. economic growth of 2.7 percent
in 2011 and 3.6 percent in 2012. The global economy will grow
4.6 percent next year and 4.8 percent in 2012, according to the
New York-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
