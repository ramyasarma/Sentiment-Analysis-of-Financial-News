Russia’s plans to produce liquefied
natural gas on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic will need more
than 850 billion rubles ($27 billion) of investment, said the
Finance Ministry.    As an incentive, Russia may set the mineral extraction tax
at a zero rate for natural gas that is produced in the region
and used for LNG, according to a proposal published on the
ministry’s website today. The tax break would begin when LNG
production starts and last until output reaches 250 billion
cubic meters or for 12 years, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
