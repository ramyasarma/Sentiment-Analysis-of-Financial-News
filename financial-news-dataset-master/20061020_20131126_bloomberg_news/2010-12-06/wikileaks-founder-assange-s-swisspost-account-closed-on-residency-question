PostFinance, the banking arm of
SwissPost, said it closed WikiLeaks.org founder  Julian Assange ’s
bank account saying he doesn’t qualify to be a client.  Assange “provided false information regarding his place of
residence during the account opening process,” PostFinance said
today in a  statement  on its website. Assange, 39, an Australian
citizen, gave Geneva as his place of residence, the statement
said. As he cannot prove that he lives in Switzerland, he “does
not meet the criteria for a customer relationship,” it said.  WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website, is releasing about
250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and on Dec. 3 began directing
readers to the Swiss domain WikiLeaks.ch rather than
WikiLeaks.org after electronic attacks on the site, it said on a
 Twitter  feed after its U.S. service was withdrawn.  “The technicality used to seize the defense fund was that
Mr. Assange, as a homeless refugee attempting to gain residency
in Switzerland, had used his lawyers’ address in Geneva for the
bank’s correspondence,” WikiLeaks said today in a  Twitter  feed.
The account contained 31,000 euros ($41,134), including some
personal assets of Assange, WikiLeaks said.  Mark Stephens, Assange’s lawyer in the U.K., couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
