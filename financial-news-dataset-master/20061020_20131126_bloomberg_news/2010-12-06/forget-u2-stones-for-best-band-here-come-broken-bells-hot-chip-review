The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Guns
N’ Roses and U2 have had their day as best group.  Download the latest by the National, Hot Chip and Broken
Bells. If you’re thinking, “who?” Well, they’re relatively
obscure groups that have produced some of the best new albums.  Brooklyn-based  the National  has made a great recording --
“High Violet” -- after a decade of refining understated rock
anthems on four previous albums. Tracks such as “Afraid of
Everyone” simmer nicely. Released on 4AD, with “You Were a
Kindness” and other bonus tracks. Rating: ***½.  U.K. electropop rockers  Hot Chip  started out making dance
songs such as “Ready for the Floor.” The title track of “One
Life Stand” (EMI) has them settling in for a long-term
relationship. Their too-cool-for-school minimalism will appeal
to fans of the xx and the  Chemical Brothers . Rating: ***.  Put on the  Broken Bells ’ eponymous debut CD (Columbia) and
the opener, “The High Road,” jumps out with its slick chords.
No surprise it’s catchy: The band’s members include Brian
Burton, better known by his stage name Danger Mouse, mastermind
of numerous hits. Rating: ***.  Danger Mouse is also a driving force on the  Sparklehorse 
CD, “Dark Night of the Soul” (Capitol/ Parlophone). The long
list of guest vocalists includes  Suzanne Vega  on “Man Who
Played God” and  Iggy Pop  on “Pain.” Rating: ***.  I Am Kloot , “Sky at Night” (EMI). These Britons often are
compared with fellow Mancunians Elbow, for whom success also was
long delayed. They shine on ballads such as “To the Brink.”
Elbow’s Guy Garvey co-produces. Rating: ***.  What is it with Manchester? Also hailing from the city are
 Delphic , whose dance moves on “Acolyte” (Polydor) recall New
Order;  Everything Everything , with a genre-defying debut “Man
Alive” (Geffen); and the duo  Hurts , whose first album
“Happiness” (RCA) aims to capture the heights of the  Pet Shop Boys . They don’t succeed, but try hard. Ratings: **.  A review copy from  Jagjaguwar  records, in a plain box and
labeled “Public Strain,” had me baffled with its weird glacial
melodies and off-key singing. It turned out to be a thing of
beauty, the second album by  Women , a misleadingly named Canadian
quartet of guys. Rating: ***½.  Fans of Women’s psychedelic raves probably will appreciate
Atlanta band  Deerhunter , whose “Halcyon Digest” on  4AD  is
drenched in guitar fuzz. Rating: ***.  Second albums are often the hardest.  Grinderman ,  Nick Cave ’s latest band, stakes its claim to greatness with a rough-
hewn series of riffs on “Grinderman 2” (Mute/Anti). Rating
***½. The impressive New York act  MGMT  isn’t so successful with
its sophomore “Congratulations” (Sony): doubtless they’ll
bounce back. Rating **.  There’s also much to laud by more-trumpeted groups such
as Arcade Fire, Band of Joy and Gorillaz. Rating: **** each.  The CDs are priced from $12.98. Download fees vary across
services.  ( Mark Beech  writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
