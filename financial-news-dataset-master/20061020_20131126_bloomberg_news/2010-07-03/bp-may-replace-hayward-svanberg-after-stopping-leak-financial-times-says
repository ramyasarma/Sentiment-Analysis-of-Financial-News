             BP Plc  may replace Chairman  Carl- Henric Svanberg  and Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  after
its leaking Gulf of Mexico well has been capped, the Financial
Times reported, citing unidentified shareholders.  
 Action to replace the top team at BP may be taken after an
investigation into the handling of the spill, the newspaper
reported, citing a U.K. shareholder it didn’t name.  
 The changes may be combined with an attempt to raise
capital through a bond sale, the FT said, citing a person close
to the company.  
 BP will make a statement about its liabilities from the
leak on July 27, when it’s scheduled to release its second-
quarter earnings, the newspaper added.  
 Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for BP, declined
to comment on the report to Bloomberg News today.
