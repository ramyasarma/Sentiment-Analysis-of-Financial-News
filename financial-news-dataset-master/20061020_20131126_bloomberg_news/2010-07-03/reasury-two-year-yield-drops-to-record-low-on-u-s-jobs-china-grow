             Treasuries rallied, pushing the two-
year note yield to an all-time low, as U.S. companies added
fewer jobs in June than economists forecast and China’s
manufacturing growth slowed.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt dropped the most in six weeks on heightened
deflation concern. The U.S. government will sell $12 billion in
10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on July 8.  
 “Whoever is calling for a double dip is emboldened by this
week,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-rate strategist in New
York at BNP Paribas SA, one of the 18 primary dealers obligated
to participate in Treasury auctions. “We have to be a little
more cautious about what we expect in the future.”  
 The yield on the 10-year note dropped this week by 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 2.98 percent,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in May 2020 increased 1 1/8, or $11.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 104 13/32.  
 The benchmark note’s  yield  fell the most since the five
days ended May 21, when it dropped 22 basis points. It touched
2.88 percent on July 1, the lowest level since April 28, 2009.
The two-year note yield slid 3 basis points to 0.62 percent
after reaching the all-time low of 0.5856 percent on June 30.  
 The difference between 10- and 2-year note debt, known as
the yield curve, dropped this week to 2.36 percentage points
after touching 2.28 percentage points on July 1, the lowest
level since Oct. 2.  
 Flattened Curve  
 The narrowed spread indicates investor preference for
longer-term bonds, which tend to rise on slowing inflation. Two-
year rates tend to track the outlook for the Fed’s target rate
for overnight lending.  
 “Bonds are saying this economy is getting bad,” said
 Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading
at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “People are going
across the curve. They are buying for yield and capital
preservation.”  
 Private employers added 83,000 jobs in June, the Labor
Department reported yesterday. The median forecast of 50
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of
110,000 positions.  
 Total U.S. nonfarm payrolls dropped by 125,000 last month
as the government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the
2010 Census. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.5 percent from
9.7 percent.  
 Fed Rate Outlook  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange showed a 17 percent
chance of the Fed raising its target lending rate for overnight
lending between banks by at least a quarter-percentage point by
the December meeting, compared with 36 percent odds a month ago.  
 There’s a “small risk of deflation,” and the rebound from
the worst recession since the 1930s faces risks from Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis, drops in state and local spending,
commercial real estate losses and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said this week in a speech
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  
 “Fed tightening is being moved further and further out
into the future,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government
bond strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, a primary dealer. “There are still
headwinds out there. There’s no glimmer of them even considering
a tightening.”  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of the inflation outlook known as the break-even rate,
narrowed 0.18 percentage point this week to 1.77 percentage
point after reaching the 2010 high of 2.49 percentage points on
Jan. 11.  
 TIPS Sale  
 Next week’s TIPS sale follows an $8 billion auction on
April 5 that drew a yield of 1.709 percent, compared with the
average forecast of 1.75 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
primary dealers. Inflation-indexed securities are intended to
provide investors with a hedge against inflation. The securities
rise or fall in value with movements in the government’s
consumer price index, with a three-month lag.  
 The consumer price index dropped 0.2 percent in May in the
biggest decrease since December 2008, the Labor Department
reported June 17.  
 Treasury 10-year notes will “retest the lows in yields we
had in 2008,”  David Rosenberg , chief economist at Gluskin Sheff
& Associates Inc. in Toronto, said yesterday in a radio
interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Surveillance. “There’s
more room for inflation expectations to come down.”  
 The Chinese government’s Purchasing Managers’ Index
declined in June more than expected, falling to 52.1 from 53.9
in the previous month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 12 economists was for a drop to 53.2. An HSBC Holdings
Plc manufacturing index slid to a 14-month low.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its growth forecast for China
this year to 10.1 percent from 11.4 percent as government
restrictions on lending and real estate slow expansion in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.
