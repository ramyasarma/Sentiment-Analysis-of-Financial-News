             The yen strengthened for a fourth
week against the dollar, the longest rally since November, as
investors sought a haven on speculation that the economic
recovery is slowing.  
 The Japanese currency gained versus 15 of its 16 major
peers as U.S. payrolls fell the first time this year and data
showed manufacturing weakened in Europe, China and the U.S. The
euro rose after the European Central Bank said it would lend the
region’s banks less money than economists forecast, fueling
optimism the firms are stronger than expected. U.S. service
industries likely slipped in June, a report July 6 may show.  
 “The solid performance of the yen was not surprising,”
said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
in New York. “A lot of the U.S. numbers have been disappointing
this week -- we’re in for slow growth.”  
 The yen gained 1.7 percent to 87.75 per dollar, from 89.23
on June 25. It touched 86.97 yen, its strongest level since
December, on July 1. The Japanese currency rose 0.1 percent
versus the euro to 110.27 yen. Europe’s shared currency advanced
1.6 percent versus the dollar to $1.2566, touching a six-week
high of $1.2612 yesterday.  
 The euro tumbled to the lowest since 2001 versus Japan’s
currency on June 29, 107.32 yen, amid concern European banks’
demand for ECB loans when a 12-month facility expired this week
would signal weakness in the region’s financial industry.  
 Bank Refinancing  
 The banks needed to repay 442 billion euros ($540 billion)
on July 1 under the ECB’s so-called Long-Term Refinancing
Operation, the biggest amount it ever awarded and a major part
of its effort to contain the financial crisis last year. The
central bank reinstated unlimited three-month lending to provide
banks with access to cash. European banks on June 30 asked for
131.9 billion ($164.7 billion) in three-month loans, less than
economists anticipated.  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of five-year bonds at an
auction on July 1, a day after Moody’s Investors Service said it
may cut the nation’s credit rating. The notes drew an average
yield of 3.657 percent, compared with 3.532 percent at the
previous sale on May 6.  
 Advanced economies among the Group of 20 nations meeting in
Toronto last weekend agreed to halve deficits by 2013 while
providing stimulus to support economic recovery.  
 “We have moved from an environment where growth was
supported at any cost, and now we’ve shifted to fiscal
responsibility,” said  Camilla Sutton , a Bank of Nova Scotia
currency strategist in Toronto.  
 Stocks Tumble  
 Stocks dropped, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index
falling a second week and closing yesterday at 1,022.58, its
lowest close since Sept. 4.  
 Nonfarm payrolls fell in June by 125,000 jobs, compared
with a drop of 130,000 forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 82
economists, Labor Department figures showed yesterday. The
government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010
census, they showed.  
 The number of jobs outside government rose 83,000, compared
with a gain of 110,000 predicted in a Bloomberg survey. The
jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 9.5 percent, from 9.7 percent.  
 Orders placed with U.S. factories in May fell 1.4 percent,
the most since March 2009, the Commerce Department said.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a drop of 0.5 percent.
Pending sales of previously owned houses in the U.S. plunged 30
percent in May, more than double the forecast, National
Association of Realtors data showed on July 1.  
 ‘Protracted and Slow’  
 “The recovery in the private sector is still very slow,”
said  Samarjit Shankar , a managing director for the foreign-
exchange group in Boston at BNY Mellon, the world’s largest
custodial bank, with more than $20 trillion in assets under
administration. “It might act as a grind on consumer sentiment
and spending, and hence the U.S. economic recovery might be very
protracted and slow.”  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which make up almost 90 percent of
the economy, declined to 55 in June from 55.4 in May, according
to a Bloomberg survey before the group reports the data July 6.  
 U.S. data showed inflation remained muted. The Federal
Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, which tracks
consumption excluding food and fuel, was at an annualized 1.3
percent for May, a report showed on June 28, close to the 1.2
percent median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  
 China’s Purchasing Managers’  Index  slowed more than
economists forecast in June, falling to 52.1 from 53.9 in May,
the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in an e-mailed
statement. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 59
economists was 53.1.  
 European Manufacturing  
 European manufacturing growth slowed in June, indicating
the euro-region recovery may weaken. A gauge of manufacturing in
the 16-member  euro region  declined to 55.6 from 55.8 in the
previous month, London-based Markit Economics said on July 1.
That was in line with an initial estimate released on June 23.  
 The Swiss franc was the only major currency to outperform
the yen this week, gaining against all 16 of its major
counterparts. The franc strengthened 1.2 percent to 1.355 per
euro, and touched a record high 1.3074 on July 1, as investors
sought a haven amid speculation the nation’s central bank
wouldn’t try to stem a rise.  
 Swiss National Bank policy makers led by President  Philipp Hildebrand  on June 17 said deflation risks have “largely
disappeared,” ending a 15-month policy of countering what they
called “excessive” gains of the franc.
