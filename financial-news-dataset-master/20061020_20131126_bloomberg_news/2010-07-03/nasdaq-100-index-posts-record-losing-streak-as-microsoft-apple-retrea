             Technology companies are suffering
some of the U.S. stock market’s biggest losses, sending the
 Nasdaq-100 Index  to the longest losing streak in its 25-year
history.  
 The measure, which gets 63 percent of its value from
computer-related companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Apple
Inc., has declined 9.7 percent after slumping 10 consecutive
days. Microsoft has tumbled 26 percent since peaking on April
22, while Apple has fallen 9.9 percent in two weeks.  
 “There is an orderly liquidation of equity positions by
traders who are taking risk units off the table,” said  Kevin Caron , a market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Florham
Park, New Jersey, whose clients have about $90 billion in
assets. “Nasdaq is typically the home of high beta risk units.
Makes perfect sense.”  
 U.S. shares are experiencing the largest losses since the
bull market began in March 2009, when the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  sank to a 12-year low. The benchmark measure of U.S.
equities has fallen in 9 out of the past 10 days as reports on
consumer confidence, manufacturing, home sales and employment
were weaker than economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted,
fueling concern the recovery is in peril. The S&P 500 fell 5
percent since June 25, the biggest weekly loss since May.  
 “We’re in a psychological bear market,” said  Robert Lutts ,
president of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts,
which oversees $500 million. “The recent economic setback is
significant,” and investors are bracing for companies to reduce
forecasts in the next few weeks, he added.  
 GDP, Profits  
 Economists predict that U.S. gross domestic product will
expand 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2011, according
to the median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Profit for
companies in the  S&P 500  are projected to rise 32 percent to a
combined $81.72 a share in 2010, according to estimates from
more than 2,000 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Barton Biggs , whose purchase of stocks in March 2009 gave
Traxis Partners LLC a 38 percent gain last year, said concern
the economy is about to contract prompted him to sell almost all
his U.S. technology shares this week.  
 “I’m worried that we could have not just a soft patch but
a double dip which lasts two or three quarters, and where
nominal GDP is only up 2 or 3 percent, and that’ll have a big
effect on profits,” Biggs said in a Bloomberg Television
interview yesterday. “It’ll scare everybody, and I’m afraid the
market goes down another 10 or 15 percent if that happens.”  
 When stocks rebound, technology shares may be the leaders,
according to  James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $375 billion
as chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis.  
 Technology is “one of the first groups to go if you go
into a downward trend,” he said. “It’s going to be one that’s
going to come back if we turn the corner again.”
