             Germany beat Argentina 4-0 to advance
to the semifinals of the World Cup in South Africa.  
 Miroslav Klose scored two goals at Green Point Stadium in
Cape Town, while Thomas Mueller and Arne Friedrich had one each.
It’s the second straight World Cup Germany has eliminated
Argentina in the quarterfinals after winning a penalty shootout
in 2006.  
 Germany will face Spain or Paraguay, who meet later today,
on July 7, one day after the Netherlands and Uruguay play in the
other semifinal.
