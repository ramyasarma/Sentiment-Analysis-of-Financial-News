             Japan’s plan to ease visa
restrictions on tourists from China may not have the desired
effect of pump-priming the economy by boosting consumer
spending, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported today.  
 While Japan’s Tourism Agency predicts the number of Chinese
tourists will jump 80 percent this year to 1.8 million people,
their spending has so far failed to have much impact on the
moribund domestic economy, the paper said, citing Ryoji Maku, a
senior researcher at Mitsubishi Research Institute Inc. Consumer
spending accounts for more than half of Japan’s gross domestic
product, the paper said.  
 Chinese tourists have each spent about $1,470 on trips to
Japan, the paper said. The new tourists being targeted are less
wealthy middle-class Chinse and may spend less, the paper said,
citing a department story executive it didn’t identify.
