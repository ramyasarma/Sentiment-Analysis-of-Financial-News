             Almost half the people in the U.K.
don’t want a referendum on changing the country’s voting system,
the  Sun newspaper  said, citing a YouGov poll it commissioned.  
 Some 46 percent of respondents were against holding the
vote, while 35 percent agreed, the newspaper reported. U.K.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  agreed to hold a referendum on May
5, 2011, bowing to political pressure from his Liberal Democrat
coalition partner, the Sun said, citing no one. The referendum
would cost an estimated 80 million pounds ($122 million), it
added.  
 The Sun didn’t say how many people were polled, how old
they were or what the margin of error was.
