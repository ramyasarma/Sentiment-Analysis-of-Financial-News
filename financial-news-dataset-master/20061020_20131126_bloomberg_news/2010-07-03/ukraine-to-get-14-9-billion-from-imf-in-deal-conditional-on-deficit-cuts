             Ukraine reached an agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund  for a new $14.9 billion loan after
the fund’s mission to the country approved economic policies
aimed at reducing the budget deficit.  
 The Washington-based lender’s Executive Board will make a
final decision by late July, the IMF said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 The agreement with Ukraine is for “an economic policy
program that can be supported by a two-and-a-half year stand-by
arrangement,” Thanos Arvanitis, the IMF’s mission chief for
Ukraine, said in the statement.  “The goal of the authorities’
economic program is to entrench fiscal and financial stability,
advance structural reforms, and put Ukraine on a path of
sustainable and balanced growth.”  
 Ukraine secured a two-year loan with the IMF at the end of
2008 after the global economic slowdown cut demand for steel,
chemical products and machines. The former Soviet state has
received $10.6 billion, which was used to cover the 2009 budget
gap and make payments for Russian natural gas deliveries.
Payments were frozen in November as the previous government
failed to cut spending ahead of January presidential elections.  
 The IMF wants a consolidated budget deficit of 5.5 percent
of gross domestic product this year and 3.5 percent of GDP in
2011. The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  initially
aimed at a target of 5.3 percent of GDP plus 1 percent to cover
funds for state-run energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  
 Positive Signal  
 “The new program is a strong positive signal for
investors,” said  Olena Bilan , chief economist at Kiev-based
investment bank Dragon Capital. “To keep the budget deficit at
5.5 percent is possible but it will require radical measures to
contain spending growth or measures to boost revenues.”  
 The IMF Executive Board will approve the new program after
Ukraine’s “approval of legislative changes relating to the
budget and financial sector,” said Arvanitis. “The fiscal
adjustment is to be achieved by tax and social security
structural reforms, expenditure rationalization combined with
efforts to improve tax administration.”  
 The lender also wants the government to ensure its banks
are adequately capitalized and to carry out reforms in the
energy sector. The IMF wants Ukraine to keep Naftogaz’s deficit
at 1 percent of GDP in 2010 and balance its finances in 2011.  
 Ukraine will inject the IMF funds mainly into the central
bank’s foreign currency reserves with some used for the deficit.
The East European nation also received a loan of $2 billion from
Russia’s VTB bank for the deficit, Azarov said last week.  
 Resumed cooperation with the IMF also opens the way for a
 European Commission  loan estimated at 610 million euros ($755.8
million). It will also help lower the interest rate on Eurobonds
that the government plans to sell this month, Deputy Prime
Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said on June 11.  
 Tigipko said in March Ukraine needs IMF support to boost
its economy, which contracted 15.1 percent in 2009, the biggest
drop since 1994. Gross domestic product expanded 4.9 percent in
the first quarter, according to state statistics data.
