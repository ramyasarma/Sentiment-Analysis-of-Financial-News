             Shareholders of  Egyptian Co. for
Mobile Services  today agreed to acquire Egyptian’s assets of
Internet service provider LinkdotNet from  Orascom Telecom
Holding SAE , Chief Executive Officer  Hassan Kabbani  said.  
 The acquisition is part of an agreement that settled a
legal dispute between Orascom and France Telecom SA, the two
biggest shareholders of Cairo-based Egyptian Co., which operates
under the brand Mobinil. Kabbani made the announcement in a text
message.  
 France Telecom  said on April 27 that Mobinil will pay $130
million for LINKdotNet SAE and Link Egypt SAE. Orascom had
postponed the sale until the settlement of its dispute with the
French company.  
 LinkdotNet competes in offering Internet services in Egypt
with TE Data of Telecom Egypt, which controls more than 60
percent of the broadband market in the country.  
 Shares of Mobinil closed 0.8 percent down at 168.63
Egyptian pounds ($29.61) on June 30 in Cairo.
