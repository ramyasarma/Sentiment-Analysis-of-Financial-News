             Free agent  LeBron James  received
the hometown pitch today from Cleveland Cavaliers general
manager Chris Grant.  
 James, 25, the National Basketball Association’s
reigning two-time Most Valuable Player, is expected to make
his decision on a team early next week.  
 “We had a very good meeting with LeBron and his
group,” Grant said in a video on the team’s website.
“Went well. Had a good time. We had fun. It was very
interactive. We know LeBron well. I would characterize it
as positive.”  
 The Cavaliers can offer $30 million more than other
teams on a maximum-length contract, the Associated Press
said. Grant was accompanied today by new coach  Byron Scott ,
owner  Dan Gilbert  and assistant general manager Lance
Blanks at the meeting that lasted just more than one hour.  
 Fans lined the sidewalk outside the IMG building where
James met earlier this week with representatives of the New
York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat and Los Angeles
Clippers. The Chicago Bulls’ contingent showed up after the
Cavaliers left.  
 “We think it’s pretty incredible LeBron chose to have
these meetings in Cleveland at his home,” Grant said.  
 James has played his first seven years in the NBA with
the Cavaliers, helping the team to five playoffs and the
best regular-season record in 2009-10.  
 “We’ve done some amazing things the last five
years,” Grant said. “We won a lot of games and went deep
into the playoffs, but we’re not satisfied with anything
we’re doing. We intend to make improvements and upgrade our
roster.”  
 Teams can begin signing free agents July 8.
