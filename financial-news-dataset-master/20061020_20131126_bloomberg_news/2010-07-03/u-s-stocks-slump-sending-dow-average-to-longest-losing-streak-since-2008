             U.S. stocks plunged this week, giving
the Dow Jones Industrial Average its first seven-day loss since
2008, after reports showing slower-than-estimated growth in jobs
and factory orders and amid concern China’s economy has slowed.  
 Alcoa Inc. and Boeing Co. slumped more than 9.9 percent
this week after the Conference Board slashed its estimate of
Chinese growth and U.S. government reports on employment and
manufacturing trailed the median economist estimates. Financial
institutions in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 7.6
percent as a group after Moody’s Investors Service said JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. may face lost revenue.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 5 percent to 1,022.58 this week, slumping
all five days and closing at the lowest level since Sept. 4. The
Dow retreated 457.33 points, or 4.5 percent, to 9,686. It last
fell seven days the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy.  
 “The problem is that when you get several important data
points that fail to meet expectations, then you get people
concerned that it’s all going to add up to a strong reassessment
of economic growth,” said  Charles Knott , co-chief investment
officer at Knott Capital U.S. Management in Exton, Pennsylvania,
who oversees about $500 million. “Stocks have taken a pounding.”  
 The Russell 2000 Index, a gauge of small U.S. companies,
lost 7.2 percent to 598.97, giving it a 19 percent retreat from
its 2010 high and putting it less than 1 percentage point away
from entering a bear market. Financial stocks in the S&P 500
have slumped 20.8 percent since their 2010 peak, while energy
shares have fallen 19.8 percent, the biggest declines among 10
industries.  
 Smallest Gain  
 The Conference Board lowered its April leading economic
index for China to the smallest gain in five months. A gauge of
last month’s U.S. consumer confidence slumped to a lower level
than all the projections in a Bloomberg News survey, while
manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in a year, according to
reports. Moody’s Investors Service warned it may downgrade
Spain, reviving concern about the European debt crisis.  
 Stocks fell for the second week, with the S&P 500’s 50-day
 average  dropping to 1,111.66, compared with the 200-day mean of
1,111.77 in a price-chart pattern known as a death cross. Death
crosses happen when the first number drops below the second. The
benchmark U.S. index also reached its lowest level of the year
yesterday.  
 “People are looking around in confusion, wondering what’s
next,” said  Gary Stroik , vice president and chief investment
officer for WBI Investments in Little Silver, New Jersey, who
manages $420 million. “We have all these people rushing to the
safety of Treasury bonds. It’s like running under a tree during
a thunderstorm.”  
 Bonds Beat Stocks  
 Bond returns exceeded stock gains by the widest margin in
nine years during the first six months of 2010, as all 10 equity
industries dropped. While U.S. stocks have fallen 16 percent and
lost $2.4 trillion since April 23, they may end up surging
through the end of the year, said  Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup
Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist. Stocks should gain as
Republicans gain votes in Congress in November and the benefits
from European debt-cutting measures become clear, he said.  
 Government spending may be poised to decline given that
Republicans are likely to gain seats, a bullish sign for
investors, Levkovich said in a July 1 interview with Bloomberg
Television. A decision on whether to extend tax cuts implemented
by former President  George W. Bush  will also help send the S&P
500 as high as 1,175, Levkovich wrote in a June 30 note.  
 Just Like 1982  
 Birinyi Associates Inc. also expects equities to gain. The
rally since March 2009 and the retreat that began two months ago
mimic the pattern set in 1982, when a bull market that lasted
five years began, according to Birinyi data.  
 Financial companies  declined more than any other group this
week, dropping the most since May 2009. JPMorgan, the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, along with Bank of America and
Wells Fargo & Co. may lose $1.38 billion in annual revenue from
a proposed cap on debit-card fees, according to Moody’s.  
 JPMorgan Chief Executive officer  Jamie Dimon  said this week
a dividend boost is unlikely for 2010. The shares fell 9.2
percent to $35.83, while Bank of America lost 10 percent to
$13.84 and Wells Fargo slid 8 percent to $24.88.  
 JPMorgan had its second-quarter earnings-per-share estimate
reduced by Bank of America analysts this week.  General Mills
Inc.  forecast for the year ending in May 2011 trailed analysts’
estimates. The maker of Lucky Charms cereal and Progresso soup
slumped 5.1 percent to $35.42 this week. Alcoa Inc., the biggest
U.S. aluminum producer, will become the first Dow companies to
report second-quarter results on July 12.  
 Commodity Prices  
 AK Steel Holding Corp. declined 15 percent to $11.71 this
week, while U.S. Steel Corp lost 13 percent to $37.66. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  19 raw materials  declined
4.2 percent, its worst weekly performance since the five days
ended May 7. Materials companies and industrial shares in the
S&P 500 lost 6.8 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.  
 Massey Energy Co. lost the most among energy producers. The
coal-mine owner slid 16 percent to $26.31 this week, dragging
the group down 5.5 percent. All 10 industries in the S&P 500
slid at least 1.2 percent this week.  
 “People are avoiding risk and there is an overarching
concern that the economy is heading into a slowdown,” said  Art Hogan , chief market analyst at New York-based Jefferies Group
Inc. “If you’re concerned about the pace of the economy, then
it’s difficult to hang onto stocks.”
