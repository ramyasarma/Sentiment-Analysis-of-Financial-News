             The International Monetary Fund
announced a new staff-level agreement for Ukraine worth $14.9
billion. Under the terms of the agreement, the government must
achieve a budget deficit of 5.5% of gross domestic product this
year and 3.5 percent next year, the IMF said in an e-mailed
statement today. The government must also ensure the country’s
banks are sufficiently capitalized and must undertake reforms in
the energy industry, the IMF said.
