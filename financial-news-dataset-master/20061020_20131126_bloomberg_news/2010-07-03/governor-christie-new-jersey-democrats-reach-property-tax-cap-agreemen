             New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
and the Democrats who control the state Senate said they have
reached agreement on a plan to curb growth of the property taxes
used to fund local government and schools, the highest of any
U.S. state.  
 Under the legislative proposal, tax increases would be
capped at 2 percent with exemptions for rising health-insurance
costs, bond payments and school enrollment growth, Christie told
reporters today in Trenton.
