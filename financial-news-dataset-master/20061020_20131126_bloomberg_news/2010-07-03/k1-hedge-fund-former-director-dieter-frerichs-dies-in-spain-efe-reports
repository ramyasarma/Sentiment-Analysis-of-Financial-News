             Dieter Frerichs, the former managing
director of two British Virgin Island-based units of K1 Group,
died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound today on the
Spanish island of Mallorca, Efe reported, citing unidentified
police officials.  
 Frerichs is a suspect in the German probe of K1, a hedge
fund at the center of an international investigation. He was
arrested in Spain April and conditionally released in May, Efe
said. Frerichs was 72, Efe said.
