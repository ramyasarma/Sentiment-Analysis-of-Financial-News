             The International Monetary Fund’s
board of directors agreed to disburse about $1.15 Billion to
Romania, which last week increased its sales tax to help meet
deficit targets attached to the loan.  
 Romanian authorities “are taking ambitious adjustment
measures to contain the weakening of the fiscal position and set
the stage for a sustained improvement in public finances,” IMF
First Managing Director John Lipsky said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. “Balancing the fiscal adjustment
between expenditure cuts and tax increases will help cushion its
social impact, while at the same time reversing excessive past
increases in public wages. ”  
 The IMF had postponed the meeting on Romania after its
constitutional court rejected the government’s plan to cut
pensions by 15 percent. Romanian authorities decided to raise
the value-added tax to meet the 2010 budget deficit.  
 The government , relying on 20 billion euros ($25 billion)
in loans from the IMF and the European Union to finance its
deficit, raised the VAT to 24 percent on June 26. While
rejecting the pension cuts, the court on June 25 upheld a 25
percent reduction in wages for public workers.  
 The leu strengthened as much as 1.2 percent to 4.2891 per
euro, the most since May 2009, and traded 1.1 percent higher at
4.2937 in Bucharest yesterday, the largest rally among more than
170 global currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Economic Impact  
 Romania’s economy, mired in the worst recession in two
decades, will probably contract at least 1 percent in 2010, more
than previously forecast, because of the VAT increase and wage
cuts, Finance Minister  Sebastian Vladescu  said on June 29.
There will probably be “higher inflation and a different
exchange rate” because of the tax increase, according to
Vladescu, who declined to give a figure because the ministry is
still working on a new forecast.  
 The IMF said it granted Romania a waiver for not meeting
end-of-June criteria for the loan.  
 The IMF and the government estimate GDP will contract as
much as 0.5 percent this year after shrinking a record 7.1
percent in 2009. The central bank, which left its benchmark rate
unchanged at a record-low 6.25 percent to contain inflation,
forecasts year-end inflation will be 3.7 percent.  It will
discuss a new forecast on Aug. 4.
