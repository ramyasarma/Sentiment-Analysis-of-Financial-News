             Ocado Ltd. may value itself at as
much as 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) when it publishes its
prospectus before selling stock in an initial public offering,
the Financial Times said, citing people it didn’t identify.  
 There is strong interest in the 200 million pounds of new
shares the U.K. online grocer plans to sell at a price that
would value it at 900 million pounds to 1 billion pounds, the
newspaper said, citing people familiar with the situation.  
 The prospectus is scheduled to be published July 5, the
newspaper said.
