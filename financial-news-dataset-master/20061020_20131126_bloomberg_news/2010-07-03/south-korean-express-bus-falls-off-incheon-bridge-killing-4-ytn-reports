             A South Korean bus plunged off a
bridge connecting with the Incheon international airport,
killing 12 people on board, according to a police official who
declined to be identified citing policy.  
 Twenty-four people were on the bus, including the driver.
The death toll may rise as some of the injuries were serious,
television station YTN said. The cause of the crash wasn’t known.  
 The bus fell into a mudflat under Incheon Bridge at around
1:20 p.m. local time, YTN said. The bridge connects islands to
the nearby airport.  
 Calls to  Incheon Bridge Corp ., a company that operates the
bridge, connected to an automatic response system.
