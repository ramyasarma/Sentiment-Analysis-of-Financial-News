             Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara won
today’s prologue at the Tour de France, as seven-time champion
Lance Amstrong finished in fourth place.  
 Cancellara, of the Saxo Bank team, had a time of 10 minutes
in the 8.9-kilometer (5.5-mile) time trial around the streets of
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Germany’s Tony Martin of Team HTC-
Columbia was 10 seconds back in second, with Britain’s David
Millar of Garmin-Transitions a further 10 seconds behind.  
 Armstrong, riding for the RadioShack team, finished 22
seconds back of Cancellara. Defending champion Alberto Contador
is sixth, 27 seconds behind.  
 Tomorrow’s first stage is a 223.5-kilometer ride from
Rotterdam to Brussels. The 3,642-kilometer race ends on the
Champs-Elysess in Paris on July 25.
