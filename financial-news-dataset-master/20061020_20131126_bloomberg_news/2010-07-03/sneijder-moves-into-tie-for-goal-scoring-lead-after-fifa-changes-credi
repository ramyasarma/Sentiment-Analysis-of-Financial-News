             Wesley Sneijder  has been credited
with the first Netherlands goal in yesterday’s 2-1 upset of
Brazil in the World Cup quarterfinals, putting him in a tie for
the tournament lead.  
 FIFA’s Technical Study Group, which has final say on goal
credits, made the change today, soccer’s governing body said in
a statement. The score was originally called an own goal against
Felipe Melo after Sneijder’s cross went in off the Brazilian
midfielder’s head.  
 “Shots which are on target (i.e. goal bound) and come off
a defender, or shots which rebound from the goal frame and
bounce off a defender or goalkeeper may be considered as an own
goal, but in this instance the TSG have decided to credit the
goal to the attacking player,” the FIFA statement said.  
 Sneijder, who also scored the second Dutch goal yesterday,
now has four to tie Argentina’s Gonzalo Higuain, Slovakia’s
Robert Vittek and Spain’s David Villa atop the scoring list.
