             Insurance companies would survive a
breakup of the euro,  Axa SA  Chief Executive Officer Henri de
Castries told WirtschaftsWoche.  
 The industry is also preparing for the possibility, even if
it is unlikely, the magazine reported de Castries as saying in
an interview.  
 The European Union is on a good road and in better shape
than 18 months ago, de Castries also said, according to a
preview of an article for WiWo’s next edition.
