             “ The Twilight Saga: Eclipse ,” the
latest film in the teen-vampire series, had sales of $28.6
million yesterday, putting it on track to make about $80.2
million in its opening weekend July 2-4,  Hollywood.com Box-
Office  said.  
 The movie, from Summit Entertainment LLC, is the third in a
series based on  Stephenie Meyer ’s books and is opening in a
record 4,416 theaters. The first two “Twilight” films earned
more than $1.1 billion in global ticket sales, according to
research Box Office Mojo.  
 The weekly film rankings are based off receipts for the
Friday-Saturday-Sunday period.  
 Summit opened “Eclipse” on June 30, and sales since
Wednesday have totaled $121.3 million. It had sales of $68.5
million on Wednesday, according to box-office tracker
Hollywood.com Box-Office, and a record $30 million in midnight
showings that day.  
 Summit plans two more movies based on Meyer’s fourth book,
“Breaking Dawn.”  
 The films focus on Bella Swan, a teenager whose move to a
small town puts her in the company of vampires and werewolves.
In “Eclipse,” Swan, played by  Kristen Stewart , must choose
between two suitors, vampire Edward Cullen and werewolf Jacob
Black.
