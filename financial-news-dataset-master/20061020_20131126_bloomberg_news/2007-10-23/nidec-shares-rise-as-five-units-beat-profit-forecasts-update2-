             Nidec Corp. (6594) , the world's biggest
maker of motors for hard-disk drives, rose the most in three
months in Osaka trading after five of its subsidiaries beat their
first-half profit forecasts.  
 Nidec  shares  climbed 8.9 percent to 8,530 yen at the close
on the Osaka Securities Exchange, the biggest advance since July
30. Kyoto, Japan-based Nidec was the second-largest gainer on the
Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index.  
 Nidec Copal Corp. (7756) , Nidec Sankyo Corp., Japan Servo Co.,
 Nidec-Read Corp. (6833)  and Nidec Tosok Corp. said yesterday that profit
for the six months ended Sept. 30 exceeded their forecasts.  
 The subsidiaries are ``moving onto a growth track,''
Fumihide Goto, an analyst at UBS Securities Japan Ltd., wrote in
a note today. The company's precision-motor business appears to
be ``robust,'' which may add as much as 3 billion yen ($26
million) to its first-half operating profit  forecast  of 32
billion yen, Goto said.  
 The analyst has a ``buy''  rating  on shares of Nidec, which
is scheduled to report earnings on Oct. 26.
