             Bank of Communications  Ltd., the
nation's fourth largest by market value, posted a record gain in
Hong Kong trading on optimism that  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  will raise
its stake in the company.  
 The bank's stock gained 19 percent to an all-time high of
HK$13.16, the biggest percentage gain since Bank of
Communications' June 2005 initial public offering. Almost 382
million shares were traded, more than triple the daily  average 
over the previous six months.  
 Chairman Jiang Chaoliang on Oct. 18 said there are no legal,
regulatory or technical obstacles for London-based HSBC to raise
its ownership, adding that a deal could be completed within a
year. Jiang also said he's targeting a  profit  of 20 billion  yuan 
($2.7 billion) in 2007, up 63 percent from a year earlier.  
 ``Bank of Communications' management has indicated that HSBC
will raise its stake'' by buying its  Hong Kong  stock, said Liu Xiaochang, a Nanjing-based analyst at Huatai Securities Co. ``The
2007 earnings guidance disclosed by its chairman well exceeded
market expectations.''  
 HSBC,  Europe 's biggest bank by market value, wants to return
its holding in the Chinese lender to 19.9 percent after its stake
was diluted to 18.1 percent when Bank of Communications, also
known as Bocom, sold 3.19 billion yuan of shares in Shanghai in
May.  
 Bocom's Shanghai shares jumped 6.7 percent to 16.08 yuan.  
 Today's gain came after HSBC analyst Todd Dunivant raised is
rating on the Bocom to ``overweight'' from ``neutral.'' He set a
target price of HK$14.40 for the stock.
