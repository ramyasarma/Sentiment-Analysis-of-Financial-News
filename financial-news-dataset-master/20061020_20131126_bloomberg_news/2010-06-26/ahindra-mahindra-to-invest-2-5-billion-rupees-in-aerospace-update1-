             Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , India’s
biggest maker of sport-utility vehicles and tractors, plans to
invest 2.5 billion rupees ($54 million) in its aerospace
business as part of a push to expand into new markets.  
 “We are planning to invest 1.5 billion rupees for
manufacturing components and roughly 1 billion rupees in
manufacturing aircraft,” Vice Chairman  Anand Mahindra  said at a
news conference in the southern Indian city of Bangalore.  
 The automaker entered the aerospace industry last year by
purchasing majority stakes in Aerostaff Australia, a component
manufacturer, and Gippsland Aeronautics, a maker of turboprop
aircraft. It has also been in talks with Boeing Co. and Airbus
SAS seeking orders for aviation components.  
 Mahindra said in a statement today it is in the final
stages of setting up a plant. The company is spending $10
million to set up a facility in Bangalore to produce aircraft
parts,  Hemant Luthra , head of the company’s autoparts division,
said in December.  
 Mahindra  intends to bid for South Korea’s  Ssangyong Motor
Co.  by July and is conducting due diligence, Mahindra also said
today.  
 Pyeongtaek, South Korea-based Ssangyong, which entered
bankruptcy protection in February 2009, offers buyers access to
Asian and Russian markets, sale advisers Samjong KPMG Advisory
Inc. and Macquarie Group Inc. said in a document sent to
investors.
