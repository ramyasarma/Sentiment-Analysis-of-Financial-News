             Alex Rodriguez  slammed a game-
winning home run as the Yankees took a 2-1 victory over the
Dodgers in the first Major League Baseball game between the
teams since  Joe Torre  left New York for Los Angeles in 2007.  
 Rodriguez broke a tie in the sixth inning with his solo
homer after scoring for the Yankees in the second on  Jorge Posada ’s single.  Manny Ramirez  hit a one-run single in the
first to put Los Angeles on the scoreboard at Dodger Stadium.

hits, one run and three walks and striking out seven.  Mariano Rivera  struck out the side in the ninth for his 17th save.  
 Vicente Padilla  (1-2) gave up six hits and two runs while
striking out seven in seven innings.  
 The Yankees (46-27) are first in the American League East
division, three games ahead of the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston
Red Sox. The Dodgers (39-34) are in third place in the National
League West, four games behind leading San Diego Padres.  
 Torre accumulated a record of 1,173-767 as he managed the
Yankees to four World Series titles during his 12-season career
in New York.
