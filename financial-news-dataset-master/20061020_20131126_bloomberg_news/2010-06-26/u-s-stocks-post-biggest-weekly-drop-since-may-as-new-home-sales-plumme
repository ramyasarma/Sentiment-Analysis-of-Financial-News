             U.S. stocks fell this week, with the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropping four straight days, after
new-home sales sank to a record low and the Federal Reserve said
European indebtedness may harm American growth.  
 Banks surged yesterday, paring the S&P 500’s weekly drop,
after Congress scaled back a financial-reform bill. Microsoft
Corp., Chevron Corp. and General Electric Co. led the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  lower with losses exceeding 6.5 percent this
week. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. helped send energy shares to the
biggest loss among 10 industries in the S&P 500, while BP Plc
fell 15 percent, after the Obama administration said it would
appeal a ruling that lifted a moratorium on deepwater drilling.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 3.7 percent, the most since the period
that ended May 21, to 1,076.76 this week. The Dow retreated
306.83 points, or 2.9 percent, to 10,143.81 after new-home sales
in May slowed to an annual pace of 300,000.  
 “A horrifying number,”  David Kovacs , head of quantitative
strategies at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn,
Pennsylvania, which manages $19 billion, said of the housing
data. “That’s what could keep investors awake at night with
fear. Such a decline in new and existing home sales, these are
numbers that really make you pause and begin to worry. It’s not
what you would expect 18 months into a recovery.”  
 The U.S. Commerce Department said June 23 that purchases of
new homes fell in May to a record low as a tax credit expired,
showing the market remains dependent on government support. The
same day, the Fed’s Open Market Committee said “financial
conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on
balance.” Swaps protecting against the Greek government
defaulting on its debt jumped to a record high.  
 Spurring Volatility  
 The annual changes to equity indexes managed by Russell
Investments took effect after the close of trading yesterday.
Traders including  Michael Nasto  of U.S. Global Investors Inc.,
which manages about $2.5 billion in San Antonio, said the
adjustments may have spurred volatility. The S&P 500 shifted
between gains and losses at least 25 times before 1
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Russell estimates that $542 billion is invested in funds
that seek to track the performance of the firm’s U.S. stock
market measures, which include the Russell 1000 Index of the
biggest American companies and the Russell 2000 Index of small
companies. Investors that mimic those gauges must buy and sell
shares to match Russell’s adjustments.  
 Investor Lawsuit  
 Energy  stocks fell the most among the 10 main S&P 500
industries, retreating 5.9 percent, the most in seven weeks.  
 Anadarko , the Texas oil company that owns 25 percent of
BP’s damaged Gulf of Mexico well, sank 11 percent to $37.68
after being sued by investors who said the company made false
statements about drilling safety on June 23.  
 BP , the largest oil and natural-gas producer in the Gulf of
Mexico, slumped 15 percent to $27.02, the lowest price since
June 1996.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Automobiles & Components Index
retreated 5.7 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
consumer restraint and high unemployment would mean
“sluggishness” for industry sales.  
 Harley-Davidson , the largest U.S. motorcycle maker, tumbled
8.7 percent to $24.49 after dropping to $23.70, the lowest
closing price since Feb. 12. Ford Motor Co., the second-biggest
U.S. carmaker, dropped 6.2 percent to $10.75. Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co., the largest U.S. tiremaker, declined 4.9 percent to
$11.40. Johnson Controls Inc., the world’s largest maker of
automotive seats, slipped 3.8 percent to $27.76.  
 No Prohibition  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index rallied 2.8
percent yesterday after congressional negotiators agreed on
reform that limits rather than prohibits the ability of
federally insured banks to trade derivatives and invest in hedge
funds or private equity funds. The gauge declined 1.4 percent
this week.  
 Moody’s Corp. , a credit-rating company, surged 4.3 percent
to $22.01 as lawmakers agreed to modify legislation that would
have made it easier to sue credit-rating companies.  
 Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, increased 1.1 percent to $139.66.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. was one of only five companies to gain
in the 30-stock Dow this week, rising 0.7 percent to $39.44.

     Lawmakers from the House and Senate worked through the night in a 20-hour session to reach deals on a ban on proprietary trading by banks and oversight of the derivatives market. Bove talks with Betty Liu and Jon Erlichman on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop.”  (Source: Bloomberg)
