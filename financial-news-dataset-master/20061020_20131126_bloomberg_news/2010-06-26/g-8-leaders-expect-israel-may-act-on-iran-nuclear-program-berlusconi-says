             Group of Eight leaders expect Israel
may decide to take action against Iran out of concern that the
country is building nuclear weapons, Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  said.  
 Since “Iran is not guaranteeing a peaceful production of
nuclear power, the members of the G-8 are worried, and believe
absolutely that Israel will probably react preemptively,”
Berlusconi told reporters today in Huntsville, Ontario, after a
two-day meeting with other G-8 leaders. He didn’t elaborate.  
 Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes such
as power generation and has rebuffed United Nations Security
Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment. The Security
Council imposed a fourth set of sanctions on Iran on June 9,
backed by Russia and China.  
 G-8 leaders, in a statement today after their meeting, said
they are “profoundly concerned by Iran’s continued lack of
transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated
intention to continue and expand enriching uranium.”
