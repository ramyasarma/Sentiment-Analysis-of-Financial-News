             Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co . has
started supplying steel sheets to autoparts makers affiliated
with Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., the Nikkei
newspaper said.  
 The electric-furnace steelmaker plans to ship about 1,000
tons a month, the newspaper said, without saying where it got
the information. The steel will be used to reinforce doors and
seats and pricing and shipment volumes will be revised quarterly,
the newspaper said.  
 Tokyo Steel is branching out into the automotive industry
as iron ore prices increase and steel scrap costs decline,
making its products cheaper than those from its blast furnace
rivals, the paper said. Japanese automakers use steel made from
iron ore by blast furnace steelmakers including Nippon Steel
Corp., it said.
