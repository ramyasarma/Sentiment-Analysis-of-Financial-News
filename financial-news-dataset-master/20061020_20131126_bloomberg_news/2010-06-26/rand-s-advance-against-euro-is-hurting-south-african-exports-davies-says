             South African Trade Minister  Rob Davies  said there is a “very widely held view” that the
country needs a more competitive and stable currency, and a
decline in the value of the euro is hurting exports.  
 “The issue is a real one and the debate is what we do
about it,” Davies told reporters at press conference in Cape
Town today ahead of the Fortune Global Forum. “I am not in a
position to give you any detail of any likely responses.”  
 The rand has gained 12 percent against the euro this year
after advancing 24 percent the year before.  
 Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel  is leading
efforts to devise “a new growth path” for South Africa, which
aims to create more jobs and ensure wealth is more evenly
distributed, Davies said.  
 In the February budget, the National Treasury said it
expects the economy to grow 2.3 percent this year after
contracting 1.8 percent last year. The growth forecast is likely
to be raised when the mid-term budget is released in October,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said on May 11.  
 “Our growth performance is picking up,” Davies said.
“It’s not what it needs to be. We need to produce much more
labor absorption.”
