             China should speed up the
development of the corporate bond market, according to the  China
Securities Regulatory Commission .  
 CSRC is committed to “improving corporate bond market
entrance and the bond issuance approval process and developing
better credit ratings,”  Shang Fulin , the chairman of the
regulatory body, said at a financial forum in Shanghai today.  
 The CSRC is making efforts to encourage companies to reduce
their reliance on bank lending, he said.  
 Chinese bond sales surged to 1.96 trillion yuan ($288
billion) last year from 981 billion yuan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Issuance on China’s over-the-counter interbank market has
also jumped. Some 255 billion yuan of commercial paper and
medium-term notes were issued in the first quarter of 2010 on
the interbank market, compared with 91 billion yuan of corporate
bonds, according to China Lianhe Credit Rating Co.  
 Last year some 1.2 trillion yuan was issued, compared with
497 billion yuan in corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg data.
