             Relations between Russia and the
U.K. “need a certain adjustment,” President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said after meeting Britain’s Prime Minister  David Cameron  for
the first time.  
 “We are in agreement that our bilateral relations require
personal attention of the leaders to economic and other
issues,” Medvedev said in Huntsville, Ontario, according to a
 transcript  of the leaders’ comments that was posted on the
Kremlin’s website today. “We are filled with determination to
make them more productive, more intense.”  
 Cameron said the meeting at the Group of Eight summit was
“very productive,” adding that the nations’ leaders need to
give a new boost to relations between their countries, according
to the transcript. The U.K premier will continue to speak with
Medvedev directly and follow the Russian president’s messages on

there was also a brief discussion of BP Plc, Arkady Dvorkovich,
Medvedev’s economic adviser, told reporters in Huntsville,
Ontario yesterday. Russia “is interested in a favorable
resolution of the BP situation,” he said, without providing
details.  
 The death of Alexander Litvinenko, an ex-KGB agent who was
poisoned in London in 2006, worsened U.K.-Russian relations,
already tense over Britain’s decision to grant asylum to Boris
Berezovsky and other Kremlin critics. The U.K. is the fourth-
largest foreign investor in Russia after Cyprus, the Netherlands
and Luxembourg, according to the Federal Statistics Service.
