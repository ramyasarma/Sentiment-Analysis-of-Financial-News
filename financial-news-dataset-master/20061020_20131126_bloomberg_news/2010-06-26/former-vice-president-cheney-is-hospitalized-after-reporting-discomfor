             Former U.S. Vice President  Dick Cheney  was admitted to the hospital yesterday, his office said
in a statement.  
 Cheney wasn’t feeling well and visited his doctors in their
offices at George Washington University, spokesman Peter Long
said in an e-mail. He entered the hospital for further testing
on the doctors’ advice and is expected to stay there over the
weekend, Long said.  
 Further details weren’t immediately available.  
 Cheney, 69, has a history of heart-related medical
problems. In February, he suffered a “mild” heart attack after
experiencing chest pain, his office said. At the time, he
underwent a stress test and a heart catherterization.  
 He had four other heart attacks, all of them before he
became vice president in January 2001. Cheney and Republican
President  George W. Bush  left office in January 2009.  
 A defibrillator implanted in his chest to regulate his
heartbeat was replaced in July 2007 with a new one with fresh
batteries. In November 2007, he was treated for atrial
fibrillation, a type of heart arrhythmia.  
 In October 2008, he was treated for an abnormal heart
rhythm.
