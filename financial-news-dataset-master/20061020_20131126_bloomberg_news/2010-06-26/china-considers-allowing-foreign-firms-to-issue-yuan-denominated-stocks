             China is considering a plan to
encourage foreign companies to issue yuan-denominated stocks in
China, Yao Gang, vice chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, said at a forum in Shanghai.  
 Regulators are also studying allowing domestic listings of
Hong Kong exchange-traded funds and the issuance of yuan-
denominated mutual funds in the city, he said.
