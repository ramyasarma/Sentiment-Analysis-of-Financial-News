             New Zealand, Australia and South
Africa all tuned up for the Tri-Nations rugby series with home
victories over northern hemisphere teams.  
 The All Blacks extended their winning run over Wales to 23
matches with a 29-10 victory in the second Test in Hamilton,
while the Wallabies kept Ireland try-less in a 22-15 win in
their one-off Test in Brisbane.  
 Morne Steyn scored 26 points and Bryan Habana tied the
South African try-scoring record as the world champion
Springboks beat Italy 55-11 in East London to seal a 2-0 series
victory. Habana touched down once to take his tally to 38 in 60
Tests, equaling Joost van der Westhuizen’s tally in 89 matches.  
 New Zealand hosts defending champion South Africa in the
opening Tri-Nations matches on July 10 and 17.
