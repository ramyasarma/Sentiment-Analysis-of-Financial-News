             (Corrects number of pitches thrown through eight innings
in second paragraph of story that moved June 25.)  
 Arizona Diamondbacks right-hander
 Edwin Jackson  pitched the Major League Baseball season’s fourth
no-hitter in a 1-0 victory over his former teammates, the Tampa
Bay Rays.  
 Jackson, who improved to 5-6 this season, said manager  A.J. Hinch  made a “pretty controversial move” in allowing him to
go back out for the ninth inning when he had already thrown 134
pitches. Jackson walked eight Rays batters and struck out six
in an outing of 149 pitches, including 79 strikes.  
 “I told him I wasn’t coming out until I got a home run or
a hit,” Jackson, 26, said in a televised interview at
Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.  
 Adam LaRoche  hit a home run for Arizona (29-45) in the
second inning off losing Rays pitcher  Jeff Niemann  (6-2), who
gave up six hits and two walks and struck out eight in 7 1/3
innings. It was the second no-hit loss by the Rays this year.  
 Jackson’s no-hitter was the second in Diamondbacks history.
 Randy Johnson  pitched a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves
in a 2-0 Arizona win on May 18, 2004.  
 Ubaldo Jimenez  pitched the first no-hitter of the season
on April 17 as the Colorado Rockies beat the Braves 4-0.
Oakland’s  Dallas Braden  threw a perfect game in the Athletics
4-0 win over the Rays on May 9, followed by a second perfect
game from Philadelphia’s  Roy Halladay  in a 1-0 Phillies victory
over the Florida Marlins on May 29.
