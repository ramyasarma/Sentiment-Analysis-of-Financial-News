             Trading Corp. of Pakistan will
invite bids for buying 175,000 metric tons of refined sugar, the
notice to be issued June 28, Chairman Anjum Bashir said.  
 “The tender will open August 7,” he said in a phone
interview today from Karachi. Pakistan plans to import 1.2
million tons of sugar to control demand and prices. The Asian
country on June 21 called bids to purchase 200,000 tons in a
tender to be awarded July 31.  
 “With the last two bid calls the target of total imports
may be completed,” Bashir said. “If it’s not completed with
these two, we may call more bids.”
