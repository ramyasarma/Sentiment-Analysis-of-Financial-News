             PICC Property & Casualty Co.’s
underwriting operations should be profitable this year, said  Wu Yan , chairman of China’s biggest non-life insurer.  
 The operation “should be able to achieve” the goal of
making a profit even amid flooding in some parts of China, he
told a forum in Shanghai today.  
 PICC’s profit jumped 16-fold last year as the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index surged 80 percent, boosting investment
returns. Underwriting losses narrowed 21 percent to 2.06
billion yuan ($302 million), as net premium growth outpaced
increases in claims.  
 Natural disasters this year, including droughts, a deadly
earthquake in western Qinghai Province, and floods in southern
China, haven’t caused losses on the same scale as the Sichuan
earthquake and snowstorms in 2008, when PICC’s payouts climbed
to 60.7 billion yuan, Wu said May 18. PICC paid out 64.5
billion yuan in 2009.  
 Flooding in southern China has killed at least 211 people,
left 119 missing and displaced 2.4 million as of June 23,
according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Direct economic
losses are estimated at 43.3 billion yuan ($6.35 billion),
including the collapse of 215,000 housing units and complete
destruction of crops on 277,800 hectares of land.
