             The U.K. plans to introduce a cap on
immigration next month for the first time, the London-based
Times reported.  
 Home Secretary  Theresa May  will announce a nine-month
temporary limit before new rules take effect in April 2010, the
newspaper said.  
 The government will allow only 24,100 workers from outside
the European Union into the country before April and will impose
more stringent requirements on highly skilled migrants, the
newspaper said.
