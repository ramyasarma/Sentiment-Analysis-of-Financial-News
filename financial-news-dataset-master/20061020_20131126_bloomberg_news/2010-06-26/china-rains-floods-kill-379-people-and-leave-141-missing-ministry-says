             Rains and floods in southern China
have killed 379 people and left 141 missing, the Ministry of
Water Resources said today, citing estimates by the  Office of
State Flood Control  and Drought Relief Headquarters.  
 The disaster has caused an estimated economic loss of 82.4
billion yuan ($12.1 billion) and has displaced 4.54 million
people, it said on its website.  
 Still, southern China is bracing for torrential rain today
and early tomorrow, the China Meteorological Administration
warned this morning.  
 Provinces including southern Zhejiang, Jiangxi, most of
Fujian, Guangdong and central to southern Guangxi will receive
heavy or torrential rain today, the agency said, urging local
governments to prepare for disasters such as landslides.  
 Flooding in 2010 has thus far affected 68.7 million people
in 22 provinces, municipalities and regions, as well as
inundating about 4.4 million hectares (11.9 million acres) of
crops, the office said today in a statement on its Web site.  
 Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  visited flood-hit Fuzhou city in
the eastern province of Jiangxi on June 24 to inspect the fight
against the flooding and review disaster relief work. Wen also
asked local officials to send more funds and materials to ensure
that basic living needs of flood victims are met.
