             Treasuries rose, pushing the yield
on the two-year note within four basis points of its all-time
low, as the Federal Reserve said the pace of recovery is
“likely to be moderate for a time.”  
 U.S.  10-year debt  gained this week the most in more than a
month as a government report showed the economy grew in the
first quarter less than previously calculated and economists
forecast that payrolls figures next week will show employers
eliminated 110,000 jobs in June. Government auctions of two- and
seven-year notes produced higher-than-forecast demand.  
 “Economic numbers are getting weaker, and the market is
still nervous,” said  Paul Horrmann , a broker in New York at
Tradition Asiel Securities, an interdealer broker. “It just
feels like people want to own Treasuries no matter what.”  
 The yield on the 10-year note fell this week 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.11 percent, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The drop was the biggest since the five
days ended May 21, when the yield fell 22 basis points. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in May 2020 increased
30/32, or $9.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 103 1/4.  
 The two-year note  yield  fell six basis points to 0.66
percent after touching 0.63 percent on June 24, compared with
0.6083 percent in November and the all-time low of 0.6044
percent reached in December 2008.  
 U.S. government debt has gained 5 percent in 2010,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes as of June
24. It’s the best performance at this point in the year since
1995.  
 ‘Extended Period’  
 Treasuries rallied after Federal Reserve policy makers
reiterated on June 23 their commitment to an “extended period”
of low borrowing costs.  
 “Financial conditions have become less supportive of
economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments
abroad,” the central bank said.  
 The Fed held the target rate for overnight lending between
banks at a record low zero to 0.25 percent, a decision forecast
by all of the 98 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “There is continuous nervousness as the economy is still
weak, the Fed is increasingly dovish and inflation remains
nonexistent,” said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government
trading in New York at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a brokerage for
institutional investors.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than the median forecast of 79 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey, and compared with a 3 percent estimate
issued last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  
 Dependent Economy  
 The new figures showed an economy that was more dependent
on inventory restocking and less driven by demand from consumers
and businesses before the European sovereign-debt crisis
intensified.  
 A lower-than-expected 431,000 new jobs in May included a
411,000 jump in government hiring of temporary workers for the
2010 census, the Labor Department reported on June 4. The
payrolls report for this month is due on July 2.  
 “We’ve been seeing a weaker economic story both
domestically and abroad, which is adding headwinds to a recovery
and supporting Treasuries,” said  Larry Milstein , managing
director of government and agency debt trading in New York at
R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors. “The GDP number is in line with
everything we’ve been seeing lately.”  
 The consumer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month in
the biggest decrease since December 2008, the Labor Department
reported June 17.  
 Inflation Outlook  
 The difference in yield between five-year Treasuries and
similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
indicates investors anticipate an annual  inflation  rate of 1.68
percent over the term of the securities, down from 2.25 percent
at the end of last year.  
 Group of 20 leaders meeting in Toronto this weekend will
discuss policies aimed at addressing Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis, spurring global growth and overhauling regulation of the
financial system. Leaders may also discuss proposals for a
global bank levy and a tax on securities transactions to clamp
down on financial speculation.  
 Treasuries remained higher after the government sold a
combined $108 billion of two-, five- and seven-year notes.  
 Investors submitted bids for 3.01 times the amount of
seven-year debt on offer on June 24, the highest bid-to-cover
ratio since the notes were reintroduced in February 2009. The
$40 billion in two-year notes sold on June 22 produced a record
low yield of 0.738 percent.
