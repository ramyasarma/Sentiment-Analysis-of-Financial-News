             South Africa’s Minister in charge of
the National Planning Commission Trevor Manuel said credit
rating agencies need to be monitored.  
 Rating companies have their “own paradigm,” which may
work against African nations, Manuel told delegates at the
Fortune Global Forum in Cape Town today. There should be a
system to “rate the raters,” Manuel said.
