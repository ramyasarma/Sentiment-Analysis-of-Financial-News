             Hong Kong is studying the
possibility of cooperating with Shanghai on internationalizing
the yuan, K.C. Chan, the city’s secretary of the financial
services and the treasury, said at a financial forum in
Shanghai.  
 Hong Kong plans to introduce yuan products for the city and
overseas investors, Chan said, without elaborating.
