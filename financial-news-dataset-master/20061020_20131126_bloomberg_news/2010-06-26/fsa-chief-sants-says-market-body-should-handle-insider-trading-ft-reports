             Financial Services Authority Chief
Executive Officer Hector Sants said the new Consumer Protection
and Markets Authority should be in charge of prosecuting U.K.
criminal insider dealing cases, the  Financial Times  reported.  
 U.K. Chancellor George Osborne plans to give the
responsibility of insider trading cases to the new Economic
Crime Agency, the newspaper said, citing unidentified government
officials.  
 Sants, who has agreed to remain in his post to handle the
handover of the FSA’s duties to the Bank of England and the new
consumer authority, told its annual meeting that the FSA has
built a "specialist resource" for insider trading cases, the FT
said.
