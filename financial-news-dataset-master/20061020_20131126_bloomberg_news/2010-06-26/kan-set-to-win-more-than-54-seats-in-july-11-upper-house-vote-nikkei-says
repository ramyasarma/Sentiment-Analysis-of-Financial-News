             Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
Democratic Party of Japan is projected to win more than the 54
seats he is defending in a July 11 upper house election, the
Nikkei newspaper reported, citing its own survey.  
 Kan needs 56 seats to secure a majority with his coalition
partner the People’s New Party, the newspaper said, adding that
60 seats would give the DPJ a stand-alone majority.  
 The DPJ will probably win 20 seats in the proportional
representation ballot, the same number they obtained in the 2007
upper house election, according to the survey.
