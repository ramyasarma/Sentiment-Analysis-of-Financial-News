             OAO Russian Railways still wants to
acquire a stake in Deutsche Bahn AG when the company is up for
sale again,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported today, citing an interview
with  Vladimir Yakunin , the Russian company’s president.  
 Yakunin also plans to speed up cargo trains, so that by
2012 they will take seven days to cross from Russia’s far east
to its western border and by 2015 make it to the Belorussian-
Polish border in that time, the newsmagazine said in the e-
mailed preview of a report to be published June 28.
