             Petrochemical and retail companies
lifted  Saudi Arabian stocks  from an earlier loss on the week’s
first day, as oil prices advanced to a seven-week high.  
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker,  Savola , a Saudi food producer, and  Arab
National Bank  helped the Saudi Tadawul All Share Index to rise
0.2 percent to 6,352.89. The gauge had earlier slid as much as
0.6 percent, led by declines in real-estate companies.  
 “It was a buying opportunity for petrochemicals on the
back of strong oil prices as well as the retail sector,” said
 John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in
Riyadh. “Global markets were jittery over the Saudi weekend and
it is translated in the Saudi stock market today.”  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery gained $1.65, or 2.2
percent, to $78.12 a barrel, the highest since May 5, in London
yesterday. The contract gained 2.2 percent last week.  
 In Europe, the  Stoxx Europe Index  fell 0.6 percent to
248.33 yesterday, the lowest close in more than two weeks. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-nation
equity markets, retreated for a fourth day, the longest losing
streak in seven weeks, dropping 0.5 percent to 947.56.  
 Sabic  rose 0.3 percent to 91.5 riyals.  Savola  increased 1.7
percent to 35.9 riyals and  Arab National  soared 1.4 percent to
42.4 riyals.  
 Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co., Saudi Arabia’s
biggest property company by market value, dropped as much as 1.6
percent to 12.6 riyals, the lowest intraday price since March
18, 2009, before recovering to close unchanged at 12.8 riyals.
The company swapped $225 million of its fixed-rate Islamic bond
into floating-rate notes to cut borrowing costs.  
 Taiba Holding Co.,  a real-estate developer in Medina, fell
1.2 percent to 16.35 riyals, its steepest one-day drop in a
month, after the company said it won’t pay a second-quarter
dividend because of a payment delay from the kingdom’s Ministry
of Finance.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Arab Gulf index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
