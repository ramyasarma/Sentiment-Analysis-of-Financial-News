             Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co., the
Persian Gulf country’s sovereign wealth fund, said its loss for
2009 more than doubled from a year earlier due to “the truly
global effects of the economic crisis.”  
 The net loss widened to 183 million dinars ($485 million)
from 69 million dinars in 2008. Revenue fell 28 percent to 1.04
billion dinars from 1.45 billion dinars a year earlier, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “I would characterise 2009 as a year in which we took an
inward looking approach to prepare for the future,”  Talal al Zain , chief executive officer of Mumtalakat, said in the
statement. The company sees an opportunity to this year
“potentially start the process of rebalancing our portfolio
through measured steps which fit in with our role of investing
for Bahrain,” he added.  
 Mumtalakat, established in July 2006, holds stakes in more
than 35 companies and had assets of 3.4 billion dinars as of
Dec. 31, 2009, according to its website.
