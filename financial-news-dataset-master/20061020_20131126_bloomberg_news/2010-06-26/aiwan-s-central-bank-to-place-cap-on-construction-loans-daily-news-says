             Taiwan’s central bank plans to step
up its efforts to curb speculation in the property market by
capping construction loans, the Economic Daily News reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  
 The central bank may tell lenders to cap the loans to
builders within 1.4 times the property value or 50 percent of
the building costs, according to the report.
