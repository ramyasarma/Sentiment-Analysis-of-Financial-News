             Turkish Minister for Energy and
Natural Resources Taner Yildiz comments on Nabucco, the OMV AG-led venture to build a natural-gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea
to western Europe.  
 He spoke today in Paris.  
 On the project:  
 “We would not have entered it if we had thought it
wouldn’t have been successful.  
 “As long as Europe needs gas and the countries to the east
of Turkey have gas this project is going to be realized.”
