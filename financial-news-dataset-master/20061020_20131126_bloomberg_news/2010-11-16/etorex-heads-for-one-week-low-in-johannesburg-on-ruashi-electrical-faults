Metorex Ltd. , a copper and cobalt
producer in Africa, headed for the lowest closing level in a
week after it said output at its Ruashi operation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo was curbed by electrical faults.  The stock retreated as much as 26 cents, or 5.4 percent, to
4.57 rand, before trading 3.7 percent lower at 4.65 rand at 9:57
a.m. in Johannesburg.  Metorex’s Ruashi tank house was operating at 50 percent
throughput, the company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The next five weeks would be affected by the electrical
interruptions, it said.  “We estimate that for the six months to December 2010,
copper production will be 9.1 percent lower, while cobalt
production will only decline by 1 percent,” Nishal Ramloutan, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at UBS AG, wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients dated today.  Ramloutan reduced his recommendation on the stock to
“sell” from “neutral” and lowered his price estimate to 4.65
rand, from 4.70 rand. The stock gained 19 percent from Oct. 1
until yesterday.  “We believe it will be difficult for the share to sustain
this positive momentum,” according to Ramtoulan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
