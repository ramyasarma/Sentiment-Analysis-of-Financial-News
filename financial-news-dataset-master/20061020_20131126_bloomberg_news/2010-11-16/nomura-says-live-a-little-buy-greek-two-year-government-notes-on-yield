Investors should buy Greek notes
maturing in March 2012, because the yield more than compensates
for the default risk, according to Nomura International Plc.  “Amid the uncertainties, it seems fairly clear that buyers
of March 2012 have a greater chance of getting paid than is
currently reflected in the 10.66 percent yield to maturity,”
 Fred Goodwin , a fixed-income strategist at Nomura in London,
wrote in an e-mailed research note today. “Therefore, live a
little, buy this bond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
