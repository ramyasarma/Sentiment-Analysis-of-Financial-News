Poland must assume the zloty will
appreciate in the long term and the economy will have “no
problem” so long as the currency’s gains are gradual, Andrzej
Bratkowski of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Council said in
an interview late yesterday on TVN CNBC television.  Bratkowski said he defined gradual appreciation as anything
less than gains of 0.20 zloty to 0.30 zloty against the euro
within a one- or two-month period. That corresponds to a gain of
5 percent to 8 percent for the Polish currency at current
levels, according to Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
