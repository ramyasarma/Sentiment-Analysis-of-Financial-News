HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest
bank, may as much as double the base salary of some investment
bankers following similar increases by competitors, said a
person with knowledge of the plans.  While hundreds of bankers at HSBC’s securities unit will
get a rise in base pay, their total pay won’t increase because
bonuses will be cut, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. London-based HSBC’s
Global Banking and Markets unit employs about 22,000 people.  Banks including Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG
have increased investment bankers’ salaries as a percentage of
their total pay as regulators seek to curb bonuses and reduce
risk-taking behavior. U.K. Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban  said
today firms should “think very carefully” about employee
bonuses as Britons face the biggest public expenditure cuts
since the aftermath of World War II.  U.K. rules on compensation put HSBC at a disadvantage to
U.S. and local banks in markets such as Brazil, India and China,
investment-banking head and Chief Executive Officer-designate
 Stuart Gulliver  told reporters on a Nov. 5 conference call. HSBC
was unable to recruit as many as 15 people to its investment
bank in Hong Kong because it couldn’t offer two-year
compensation guarantees, he said.  HSBC is likely to spend about 25 percent of its investment
banking revenue on variable compensation in 2010, the same as
the previous year, the person said. Officials at HSBC declined
to comment. Sky News reported the decision earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
