Pharos Financial Group portfolio
manager  Kevin Dougherty  is quitting the Moscow-based hedge fund
to set up his own firm, according to e-mail sent to colleagues.  Dougherty and a team will start a global emerging-markets
hedge fund in 2011, he said in the e-mail. The fund will be
based in London, Dougherty said in a separate interview.  “Even as I will be focusing more on the other emerging
markets, I remain a big believer in the value and investment
potential in the Russian market,” Dougherty said.  Pharos Financial, founded in 1997 with seed capital from
Soros Fund Management and Credit Suisse First Boston, has about
$40 million in funds under management. The group is run by Chief
Executive Officer Peter Halloran, who previously served as
director of equities at Credit Suisse First Boston in Moscow.  Pharos’s flagship Russia fund has delivered more than a 10-
fold return in the last decade, twice that of the MSCI Russia
Index, according to the firm’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
