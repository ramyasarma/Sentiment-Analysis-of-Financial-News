MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA  and  LLX
Logistica SA , the mining and logistics companies controlled by
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , climbed after signing
accords with  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  on iron-ore
transportation and mining.  MMX  rose  0.4 percent to 13.90 reais, and LLX  added  0.8
percent to 9.25 reais in Sao Paulo trading, making the stocks
among the biggest gainers on the  Bovespa  benchmark index. The
index declined 1.7 percent to 69,192.41.  Usiminas, Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker, will use
LLX’s port to ship iron-ore. MMX agreed to develop and invest in
Usiminas’s iron-ore mine Mina Pau de Vinho, according to a
statement sent to the Brazilian securities regulator today.  The agreements fit into Usiminas’s plan to increase iron-
ore output to 12 million metric tons by 2012 from 7 million tons
currently said  Pedro Galdi , an analyst at SLW Corretora in Sao
Paulo. Usiminas last week announced a plan to invest 500 million
reais ($288.4 million) in its mining operations while scrapping
plans to build a steel mill.  Usiminas “is establishing a plan for when it goes through
with all it said it would do: make investments, increase
capacity,” Galdi said.  MMX plans to boost its output capacity to 46 million tons a
year by 2015, from 10.8 million tons currently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
