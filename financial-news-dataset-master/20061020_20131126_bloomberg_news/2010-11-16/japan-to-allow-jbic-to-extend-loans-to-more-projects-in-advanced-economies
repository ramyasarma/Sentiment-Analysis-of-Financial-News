Japan’s government said it will
allow the nation’s state-run lender to extend loans to a wider
variety of projects in advanced nations, part of its push to get
more infrastructure deals for local companies abroad.  The Japan Bank for International Cooperation  will be able
to lend money to projects such as railways in major cities and
sewage treatment facilities, according to a statement released
today by the  Ministry of Finance . The change will come into
effect on Nov. 19.  Japan’s government formerly restricted JBIC loans to those
that fund projects in developing nations, except for nuclear
power generation and high-speed railway between major cities.  Japanese policy makers have been meeting with foreign
counterparts to try to help companies win infrastructure orders
abroad. California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  rode one of
Japan’s bullet trains in September after the nation’s transport
minister offered loans to support the state’s more than $40
billion high-speed rail project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
