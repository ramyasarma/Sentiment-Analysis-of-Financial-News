Angola , Africa’s second-largest oil
producer, will ship at least 51 crude cargoes in January,
unchanged from December’s revised schedule, according to the
preliminary loading plan.  A total of 48.9 million barrels, or 1.58 million barrels a
day, will load in January compared with 48.6 million barrels, or
1.57 million barrels a day in December, according to the
schedule. January’s plan excludes two so-called pooled cargoes,
which aren’t assigned to a specific lifter.  Angola’s December program originally comprised 48 cargoes
after disruptions at the Plutonio terminal caused three
shipments to be dropped. The cargoes were later added to a
revised schedule.  Angola’s Oil Ministry has disputed estimates that place its
OPEC quota at 1.517 million barrels a day. The ministry has said
the information used to estimate the cap is inaccurate and its
actual target is 1.656 million.  The West African state  produced  1.75 million barrels a day
of crude in October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Nigeria , the continent’s biggest producer, pumped 2.1 million
barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
