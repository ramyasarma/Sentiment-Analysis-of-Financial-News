ITV Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
commercial broadcaster, dropped as much as 5.2 percent in London
trading after the company predicted television advertising
growth will slow in the fourth quarter.  The company, whose shows include “Britain’s Got Talent” and
“X Factor,” said today television advertising revenue climbed
16 percent in the third quarter and will rise 10 percent in the
fourth quarter.  “The economic outlook for 2011 is uncertain and we
continue to plan on a cautious basis,” Chief Executive Officer
 Adam Crozier  said in a statement. “The television advertising
market has continued to recover strongly, however this does not
disguise the significant challenges ITV faces.”  Crozier, who took over in April, is trying to reduce ITV’s
dependence on the volatile advertising market and said in August
that it will offer some of its channels on pay-television
platforms and invest in online content. The London-based
company, which received about 70 percent of its revenue from
advertising last year, aims to get half of total sales from
other sources within five years, it said in August.  ITV dropped as much as 3.7 pence to 67.35 pence, the
biggest intraday decline since  July 14 , and stood at 70.6 pence
as of 8:49 a.m.  Revenue in the first nine months of the year rose 11
percent to 1.46 billion pounds. Sales of the ITV studios dropped
10 percent to 205 million pounds, “emphasizing the need for
creative renewal,” the company said.  Net debt dropped to 366 million pounds at Sept. 30 from 437
million pounds three months earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
