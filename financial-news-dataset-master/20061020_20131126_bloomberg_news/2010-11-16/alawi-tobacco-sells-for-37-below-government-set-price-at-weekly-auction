The average price of tobacco in
Malawi, the world’s largest producer of the burley variety,
dropped 37 percent below the government-set price of $2 per
kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale, Auction Holdings Ltd. said.  The leaves sold at an average $1.27 per kilogram in the
sale for the week through Nov. 12, from $1.32 recorded a week
earlier, the Lilongwe-based manager of Malawi’s auction floors
said in a statement published in the Daily Times newspaper
today. During the week, 3.7 million kilograms of tobacco worth
$4.6 million were sold, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
