Gold may decline for a third day as
signs that the U.S. economy is strengthening and the possibility
Ireland may have to accept a European Union bailout boosted the
dollar. Silver climbed after a two-day slump spurred buying.  Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,359.19 an
ounce at 10:53 a.m. in Seoul after dropping as much as 0.3
percent. The precious metal reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9.
Spot silver advanced as much as 1.4 percent to $25.8225 an ounce.  “Some increase in the  U.S. currency  is weighing on gold,”
said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “It’s a little bit of profit
taking as well at currently high levels.”  The dollar climbed as much as 0.2 percent today against a
basket of six major counterparts after gaining 0.6 percent
yesterday as an increase in Treasury yields boosted demand for
U.S. assets. Gold, which usually moves inversely to the
greenback, has gained 24 percent this year.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.2 percent in October, the most in
seven months, Commerce Department data showed yesterday.
Treasury 10-year yields climbed 17 basis points yesterday to
2.96 percent, the highest level since Aug. 5. Industrial output
in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent last month after dropping in
September, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report today.  European Union-Irish negotiations are expected to intensify
today at a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels.
Ireland may use EU aid to bail out its cash-strapped banks, the
European Central Bank said yesterday.  Gold for December delivery lost 0.7 percent to $1,359 an
ounce on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$25.6712 an ounce at 10:31 a.m. in Seoul after losing 8 percent
in the past two days.  Palladium for immediate delivery was little changed at $673
an ounce, and cash platinum climbed 0.2 percent to $1,673 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
