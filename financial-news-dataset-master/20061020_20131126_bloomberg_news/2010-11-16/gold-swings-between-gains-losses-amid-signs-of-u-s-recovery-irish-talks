Gold swung between losses and gains
amid signs that the U.S. economy may be strengthening while
Ireland may have to accept a European Union bailout. Silver
climbed after a two-day slump spurred buying.  Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,359.80 an
ounce at 4:16 p.m. in Seoul after dropping and gaining as much
as 0.3 percent. Spot silver added as much as 1.6 percent to
$25.8750 an ounce after losing 8 percent the past two days.
December-delivery gold lost 0.7 percent to $1,359.10 an ounce on
the Comex in New York.  “Some increase in the  U.S. currency  is weighing on gold,”
said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne. “It’s a little bit of profit
taking as well at currently high levels.”  The dollar was 0.2 percent higher after earlier losing 0.3
percent against a basket of six major counterparts. The index
added 0.6 percent yesterday as an increase in Treasury yields
stoked demand for U.S. assets. Gold, which usually moves
inversely to the greenback, has gained 24 percent this year.  George Soros , who’s described gold’s surge as the
“ultimate asset bubble,” cut his holdings in the SPDR Gold
Trust for a third quarter, according to a filing. Rival fund
manager  John Paulson  stuck with his bet by maintaining the
largest stake in SPDR Gold, according to a separate filing.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.2 percent in October, the most in
seven months, Commerce Department data showed yesterday.
Treasury 10-year yields climbed 17 basis points yesterday to
2.96 percent, the highest level since Aug. 5. Industrial output
in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent last month after dropping in
September, according to a Bloomberg survey before a report today.  EU-Irish Talks  European Union-Irish talks are expected to intensify today
at a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels. Ireland
may use EU aid to bail out its cash-strapped banks, the European
Central Bank said yesterday. Gold priced in euros reached a
record in June on investor concern that Greece would be bankrupt.  “If the European debt concern gets any worse, that would
surely support gold,” said Park Jong Beom, a trader at Tong
Yang Futures Trading Co. in Seoul.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-long position  in New York gold by 15,951 contracts, or
7 percent, in the week ended Nov. 9 from a week ago, according
to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  “The broader macro environment remains supportive,”  Suki Cooper , an analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote in a report dated
yesterday. “Longer-term exchange-traded product, or ETP,
investor interest has been extremely resilient despite the price
volatility and sharp drop in prices earlier last week.”  Gold assets  in ETPs were little changed at 2,087.52 metric
tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.
The metal reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov. 9.  Silver held through four ETP providers was almost unchanged
at 14,761.6 tons yesterday after reaching 14,763.8 tons on Nov.
12, the highest amount since at least February, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Immediate-delivery palladium was little changed at $672.45
an ounce and platinum dropped 0.3 percent to $1,664.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
