Variable-annuity sales in the U.S.
rose about 9 percent in the third quarter as stock markets
advanced, led by gains at  MetLife Inc.  and  American
International Group Inc.   Sales climbed to $34.9 billion in the third quarter from
$31.9 billion a year earlier, trade group Limra International
said today in  data  posted on its  website . MetLife, the largest
U.S. life insurer, was second in variable annuities as sales
advanced 35 percent to $4.7 billion from $3.4 billion. AIG, the
insurer rescued by the U.S. government, boosted sales about 33
percent to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion.  Equity-linked variable-annuity sales rose as stock markets
gained, cutting the risk companies will face from losses on
customers’ guaranteed minimum returns. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index advanced 11 percent in the third quarter.  “It’s easier to sell with the market better,”  Randy Binner , an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said in an
interview before the report was released. “It helps that the
S&P is up a lot.”  Prudential Financial Inc. , the second-biggest U.S. life
insurer, was ranked first in variable annuities with $5.4
billion in sales, down from $5.8 billion a year earlier.  Year to Date  Sales in the first nine months of this year climbed to
$102.8 billion from about $95 billion in the same period last
year. Insurers lost money from variable annuities in 2008 and
2009 because the funds backing them are generally invested in
stocks. The S&P 500 declined 38 percent in 2008.  Variable-annuity sales at New York-based AIG plunged in
2009 from the prior year, as broker-dealers shunned the
company’s products after its 2008 near-collapse. Sales have been
rising as brokers return to the insurer.  The increase was “due to competitive product enhancement,
reinstatement of new sales activity at a number of key broker
dealers and an increased wholesaler productivity,” AIG Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said in a recorded message
after third-quarter earnings were released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
