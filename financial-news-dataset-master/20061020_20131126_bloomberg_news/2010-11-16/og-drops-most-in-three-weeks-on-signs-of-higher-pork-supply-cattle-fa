Hog futures fell the most in three
weeks on signs of increasing U.S. supplies of pork. Cattle
futures also dropped.  The average weight of a hog carcass on Nov. 15 was 207.03
pounds (93.9 kilograms), up 1.4 percent from a year ago, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  showed. All 19 raw materials in
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index slumped on concern that
steps by China to damp inflation will erode demand for crops,
energy and metals.  “Weakness in commodity markets is probably going to have
the biggest effect” on hog futures, said  Paul Beere , a market
adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin. “Kill weights being up and the number of hogs coming
to market, those are all going to affect it on the negative
side.”  Hog futures for February settlement dropped 1.4 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at 73.625 cents a pound at 1:03 p.m. on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest decline for the
most-active contract since Oct. 25. The price has gained 12
percent this year.  The  price  of hogs for immediate delivery fell 2.1 percent
yesterday to 61.77 cents a pound, the biggest decline since Oct.
28. The CRB index fell to the lowest level since Oct. 22, and
the dollar rose to a seven-week high against a basket of major
currencies.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.725 cent, or
0.7 percent, to $1.021 a pound. The most-active contract has
climbed 20 percent in the past 12 months.  Cattle and natural gas had the smallest declines among CRB
components. Nickel, wheat and aluminum plunged more than 6
percent.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement dropped 0.2
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.1485 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
