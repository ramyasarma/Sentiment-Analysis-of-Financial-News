China, the world’s biggest aluminum
producer and consumer, will sell a second batch of ingots from
state reserves next week to temper prices.  The State Bureau of Material Reserve will auction 117,000
metric tons of aluminum on Nov. 23 and Nov. 24, the National
Development & Reform Commission said today on its  website . The
agency, which manages the metals reserves, sold 95,767 tons on
Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 at an average below the prevailing spot price.  Speculation that the government will intensify measures to
curb inflation, including higher interest rates and price
controls, drove China stocks today to the lowest in a month.
China, whose consumer price index rose 4.4 percent in October,
the fastest in two years, has also sold zinc, lead, paper pulp,
magnesium, cotton, and corn to ease supply shortages and prices.  “It’s one of the ways to show they are determined to
control inflation,”  Yu Mengguo , head of research at Jinpeng
International Futures Co., said from Beijing. “They are not
flooding the market with large quantities but rather sending a
signal that they think prices have climbed too high.”  Spot aluminum price quoted on Changjiang, Shanghai’s
largest nonferrous metals market, was about 16,280 yuan ($2,449)
today, compared with 16,150 yuan when the first tender was held
on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. Prices have gained 17 percent in the
second half as smelters in Henan, Guizhou, Qinghai provinces and
Guangxi region have suspended capacity as local governments try
to meet Beijing’s energy-conservation goals for the five-year
plan ending 2010.  Capacity Curbs  “They’re worried about the unintended price consequences
of this strategy,”  Peter Richardson , chief metals economist at
Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd., said on Nov. 10, when asked how
China’s energy curbs were tightening the market.  Approximately one-third of China’s aluminum smelting
capacity has been affected by the country’s energy-saving power
curbs, and total output this year may fall short of the 17
million tons forecast,  Xiao Chongxin , executive general manager
of Sanmenxia Tianyuan Aluminum Co., said on Nov. 11.  Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange reached a
25-month high on Nov. 11 and declined 1.1 percent to $2,374 a
ton at 3:31 p.m. in Shanghai.  -- Helen Sun , with assistance from  Glenys Sim  in Singapore.
