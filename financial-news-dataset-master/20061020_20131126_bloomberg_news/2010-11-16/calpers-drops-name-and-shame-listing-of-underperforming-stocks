The California Public Employees’
Retirement System will stop publishing its annual Focus List of
companies with shares it deems to be performing poorly, the
largest U.S. public pension said in a  release .  Calpers, as the fund is known, said it will abandon what it
called its “name-and-shame” approach and instead conduct
private negotiations and proxy actions to wrest better returns
from corporate laggards.  A Wilshire Consulting  study  found that the shares of 96
companies that Calpers engaged with privately had outperformed
59 Focus List companies targeted from 1999 to 2008, according to
the release issued yesterday.  “The Focus List has served us well by calling public
attention to some of the worst market players, but the time has
come for a more effective approach,” Calpers Board President
 Rob Feckner  said in the statement.  The fund, with about $220 billion in assets, started the
list in 1987, according to a Calpers press release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
