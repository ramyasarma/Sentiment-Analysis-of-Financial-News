Rubber in Tokyo rebounded after a
two-day slump, as the Japanese yen weakened to a six-week low
versus the dollar amid low supply from the top three producers.  April-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
surged as much as 2.8 percent to 363.6 yen per kilogram ($4,377
a metric ton) before trading at 361.3 yen at 12:40 p.m. local
time. The contract fell 6.7 percent in the past two days after
climbing to a 30-year high. The May-delivery contract in
Shanghai advanced by as much as 4.2 percent to 35,170 yuan
($5,295) a ton after tumbling 11 percent in the past three days.  “The weakening yen helped improve market sentiment,”
 Chaiwat Muenmee , an analyst at DS Futures Co., said today by
phone from Bangkok. “Fundamentally, low supply from Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia remains price supportive.”  Futures in Tokyo have gained 31 percent this year as
producers have had difficulty catching up with growing demand
because of rain and flooding that disrupted latex output in
Southeast Asia.  Natural-rubber output in Thailand may decline by 10 percent
to 870,000 tons in the fourth quarter, reducing total production
this year by 5 percent to 3 million tons, according to an
estimate by the Thai Rubber Association. Annual supply may fall
by 50,000 tons over the next seven years until new trees mature,
association President Luckchai Kittipol said on Nov. 10.  The cash price in Thailand, the largest producer and
exporter, was unchanged today at 131 baht ($4.39) per kilogram
after climbing to a record of 132 baht on Nov. 12, according to
the  Rubber Research Institute of Thailand . The price is likely
to rise as rain across the country’s south, the main rubber
plantation area, will continue to limit supply, it said.  Low Stockpiles  Low stockpiles in Japan and China mean that buyers will
continue purchases, said Chaiwat of DS Futures. Stockpiles held
at Japanese warehouses fell 2.8 percent to 7,552 tons on Nov. 10,
data from the Rubber Trade Association of Japan showed today.  China’s inventories increased 10,735 tons last week to
60,291 tons, based on a survey of 10 warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures
Exchange said Nov. 12. That is a 60 percent decline from this
year’s high of 151,832 tons.  The Japanese currency traded near a six-week low against
the dollar before a report that economists said will show U.S.
industrial production expanded last month, adding to signs the
nation’s recovery is gathering pace.  U.S. industrial production increased 0.3 percent last month
after dropping 0.2 percent in September, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before today’s report. Retail sales rose
1.2 percent in October, the most in seven months, Commerce
Department data showed yesterday.  The yen traded at 83.12 per dollar after falling to 83.27
yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 6. A weaker Japanese
currency improves the appeal of yen-based contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
