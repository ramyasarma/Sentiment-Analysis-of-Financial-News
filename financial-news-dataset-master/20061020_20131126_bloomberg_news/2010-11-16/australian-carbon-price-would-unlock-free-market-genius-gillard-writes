A price on carbon in Australia would
unlock “the genius of the free market,” encouraging investment
and innovation, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  wrote in an article
published in the Sydney Morning Herald.  Gillard, whose column was also carried in other  Fairfax
Media Ltd.  publications, said putting a cost on carbon was the
“only prudent answer” to uncertainty that has delayed
investment in power generation.  Gillard said the move would be a reform similar in scope to
floating the nation’s currency and cutting tariffs, a step
needed to reshape the way the Australian economy works.  “By resetting price signals, we will open the door to a
new era of investment and innovation,” Gillard wrote,
“creating thousands of jobs for Australians in the industries
of tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
