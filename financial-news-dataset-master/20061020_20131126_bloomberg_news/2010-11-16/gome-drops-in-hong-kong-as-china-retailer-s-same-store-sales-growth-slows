Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings
Ltd. , the China retailer seeking to end a dispute with its
jailed founder over management control, dropped the most in two
weeks after same-store sales growth slowed in the third quarter.  Gome,  China’s second-biggest electronics retailer , fell 6
percent to HK$3 at the 4 p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong, the
biggest drop since Oct. 29.  Same-store sales grew 21.5 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, after rising 26.8 percent in the second
quarter, on seasonality, according to  Winnie Fong , an analyst at
Taifook Securities Group Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Gome  surged 17 percent in the three trading days through
yesterday, after agreeing Nov. 10 to appoint representatives of
founder  Huang Guangyu  to its board. The agreement eased concerns
over the threat by the billionaire, who is still Gome’s  largest
shareholder , to cut ties between his 400 privately owned stores
and the listed company.  Net income  rose to 1.44 billion yuan ($217 million) in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, from 964.6 million yuan in the same
period last year,  Gome  said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
