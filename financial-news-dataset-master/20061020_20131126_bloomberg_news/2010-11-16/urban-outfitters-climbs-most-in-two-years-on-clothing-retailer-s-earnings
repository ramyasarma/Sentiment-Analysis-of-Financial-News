Urban Outfitters Inc. , operator of
the namesake and Anthropologie clothing chains, gained the most
in almost two years in Nasdaq trading after fiscal third-quarter
profit surpassed analysts’ estimates.  Net income  rose 17 percent to $73.1 million, or 43 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $62.3 million, or 36
cents, a year earlier, the Philadelphia-based company said in a
statement yesterday after U.S. markets closed. Analysts expected
42 cents, the average of 25 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Promotions had been somewhat high and there was some
investor worry heading into the quarter,” said  Edward Yruma , a
New York-based analyst for Keybanc Capital Markets who
recommends holding Urban shares. “Results were decent. The
company is clearly aggressively repurchasing shares and feels
good about the holiday season.”  Urban surged $3.90, or 12 percent, to $36.64 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  for the largest
percentage increase since Nov. 21, 2008. The stock has gained
4.7 percent this year.  Sales at stores open a year rose 1 percent in the third
quarter and will show the same gain in the current quarter,
Chief Financial Officer  Eric Artz  said yesterday on a conference
call with analysts. Same-store sales will increase in the low-
single digits next year, he said.  “We are well positioned as we head into the holiday
season,” Artz said.  The company repurchased or retired 4.3 million shares for
$133 million during its past quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
