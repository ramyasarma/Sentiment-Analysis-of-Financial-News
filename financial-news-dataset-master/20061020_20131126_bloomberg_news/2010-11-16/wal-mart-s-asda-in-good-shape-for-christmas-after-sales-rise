Asda Group Ltd.,  the U.K.
supermarket chain owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,  said it’s in
“good shape” for the Christmas trading period after third-
quarter sales climbed.  Revenue at stores open at least a year, excluding fuel and
value-added tax, rose 1.3 percent in the quarter through
September, the retailer said today in a statement. Profit
 grew “ahead of sales,” Asda said, without being more
specific.  The second-largest U.K. supermarket chain re-launched its
mid-market own-label “Chosen For You” range with more than
3,500 items in September in an effort to reverse declining
market share. Asda agreed to buy Netto’s 193 U.K. discount
supermarkets for 778 million pounds ($1.25 billion) in May.  Asda’s market share fell to 17.2 percent in the 12 weeks
ended Oct. 31, and it reported the slowest growth of the
biggest four supermarket chains including  Tesco Plc , according
to Kantar Worldpanel data.  “After a particularly tough start to the year, we’re
pleased with the progress we’re making,” Chief Executive
Officer  Andy Clarke , who took over from  Andy Bond  this year,
said in the statement. “As we approach Christmas we are in
good shape,” helped by initiatives such as the revamp of the
“Extra Special” premium-priced line, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
