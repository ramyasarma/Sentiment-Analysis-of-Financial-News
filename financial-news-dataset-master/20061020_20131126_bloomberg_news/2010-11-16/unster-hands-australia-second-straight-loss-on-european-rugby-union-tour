Irish provincial rugby team Munster
beat Australia 15-6 in a tryless match to hand the Wallabies
their second straight defeat on their European tour.  Fly-half Paul Warwick kicked all the home team’s points in
Limerick, Ireland, to lift Munster to its fourth win in seven
matches against touring Australian teams.  Berrick Barnes  booted
two first-half penalties for Australia’s second string.  The Wallabies, who are building toward next year’s Rugby
World Cup in New Zealand, also lost 35-18 to England four days
ago following victories over Wales and English club Leicester.  Before arriving in Europe, Australia beat top-ranked New
Zealand in Hong Kong to snap a record run of 10 straight defeats
against the All Blacks.  Australia plays Italy in Florence on Nov. 20, before facing
France in Paris a week later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
