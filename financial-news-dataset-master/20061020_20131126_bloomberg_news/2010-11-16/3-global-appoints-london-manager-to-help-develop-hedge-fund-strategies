H3 Global  said it has appointed a
London-based manager to design new trading strategies as the
Australian-based hedge fund seeks to expand assets from a
current A$325 million ($317 million).  Tom Furlong, who has worked at  Macquarie Group Ltd.  and
Liquid Capital Markets, will help establish operations for the
fund in the European time zone, H3 Global said in an e-mailed
statement to Bloomberg News today. He will report to H3 Global
co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Andrew Kaleel.  H3 Global’s expansion comes as its flagship commodities
fund completed five years of trading, with an average annual
return of 10.1 percent gross of fees, it said.   “Reflecting growing concern over food security, supply
constraints and increased food demand from industrializing Asia,
commodities have proved to be a very profitable investment over
the past five years,” Kaleel said in the statement.  Sydney-based Ascalon Capital Managers, which is owned by
 Westpac Banking Corp ., has a 45 percent stake in H3 Global.   To contact the reporter on this story:
