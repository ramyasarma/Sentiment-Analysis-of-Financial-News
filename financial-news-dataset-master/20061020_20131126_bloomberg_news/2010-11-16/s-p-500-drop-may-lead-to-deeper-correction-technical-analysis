The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ,
which had its biggest weekly drop in three months last week, may
face a “deeper correction” should it fall below its average
during the past 20 days, according to StockCharts.com Inc.  The benchmark for U.S. equities yesterday fell to 1,197.75,
about 2 points above that  threshold , and is approaching the
support level for a third time since the end of August. The
index broke below the average five times this year, four of
which were followed by losses of at least 6.4 percent, according
to Bloomberg data.  “That’s an important test that will help determine the
market’s short-term direction,” John Murphy, chief technical
analyst at StockCharts.com, wrote in a note yesterday. “A
decisive close below the 20-day line would signal a deeper
correction” that could take it down to its 50-day average,
recently at 1,164. That’s 2.8 percent below yesterday’s close.  The S&P 500 last week dropped 2.2 percent, snapping a five-
week rally, after concern about Europe’s debt crisis
intensified, speculation China will boost interest rates grew
and Cisco Systems Inc.’s profit projection missed analysts’
estimates. The index has rallied 17 percent from its 2010 low in
July amid improving earnings and speculation the Federal Reserve
will stoke growth by pumping more cash into financial markets.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story;
