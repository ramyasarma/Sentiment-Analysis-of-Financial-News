Chile’s government is ready to act
as mediator in talks to resolve a 12-day strike at Anglo
American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi copper mine, said
Luz Ebensperger, the region’s senior government official.  Ebensperger will contact the union representing about 1,500
Collahuasi workers who are living in an abandoned school in the
city of Iquique, she said today in an interview from Santiago.
Ebensperger is intendant of Chile’s Tarapaca region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
