Gold fell to the lowest price in
almost two weeks as the dollar rallied, eroding the appeal of
the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The dollar advanced for a second straight day, rising as
much as 1.2 percent against a  basket  of six major currencies.
Before today, gold gained 25 percent this year, touching a
record $1,424.30 an ounce last month on speculation that the
Federal Reserve’s program to buy back bonds to bolster the
economy would erode the U.S. currency.  “The dollar’s strength continues to surprise, which takes
away the flight-to-quality bid from gold,” said  Matt Zeman , a
metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $30.10, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $1,338.40 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, after touching $1,329, the lowest price for a
most-active contract since Nov. 3.  The dollar gained after a report showed factory production
in the U.S. increased in October by the most in three months, a
signal that the economy may be recovering. Another report showed
wholesale costs rose less than forecast last month.  “We’re not seeing drastic price increases, and that’s
deflated the gold balloon a little bit in terms of an
inflationary hedge,” Zeman said.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products declined 0.7 metric
ton to 2,087.52 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  Gold in Euros  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, advocates holding gold priced in
foreign currencies to hedge against relative dollar strength.  “The precious metals are being pressured by the stronger
U.S. dollar,” Gartman said. “We are bullish of gold in euro,
or sterling or even yen terms.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell 85.9 cents, or
3.3 percent, to settle at $25.233 an ounce on the Comex. The
price is up 50 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery declined $35.40, or
5.2 percent, to close at $645.90 an ounce on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, and platinum futures for January delivery
fell $40.10, or 2.4 percent, to $1,645.70 an ounce. Platinum has
gained 12 percent in 2010 while palladium has risen 58 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
