The euro climbed against the dollar
and yen after a measure of German confidence rose for the first
time in seven months in November.  The single currency gained 0.2 percent to $1.3611 at 10:02
a.m. in London, and appreciated 0.3 percent to 113.25 yen.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months ahead, increased to 1.8 from
minus 7.2 in October. Economists expected a gain to minus 6,
according to the median of 33 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
