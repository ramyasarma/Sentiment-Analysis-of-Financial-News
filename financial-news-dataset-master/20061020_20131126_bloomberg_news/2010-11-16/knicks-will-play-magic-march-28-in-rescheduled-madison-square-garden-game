The New York Knicks’ home game
against the Orlando Magic that was postponed two weeks ago
because of safety concerns at Madison Square Garden has been
rescheduled for March 28.  The Nov. 2 National Basketball Association game was called
off after concerns that debris dislodged from the ceiling at the
arena contained asbestos. Tests conducted by the city’s
Department of Environmental Protection didn’t find the
carcinogen in the air.  It was the Knicks’ first cancellation since a Jan. 7, 1996,
snowstorm forced a game to be rescheduled.  The Knicks’ schedule had included three off-days between
their March 26 game in Charlotte and a March 30 home game
against the New Jersey Nets. Orlando had four days off from
March 25-30 before adding the  rescheduled game , which has a 7:30
p.m. tipoff at Madison Square Garden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
