South African  consumer confidence 
was little changed in the fourth quarter, close its highest
level since the last three months of 2007, led by demand from
high-income earners.  The FNB/BER  consumer confidence  index was 14, compared with
15 in the previous three months,  First National Bank  and the
 Bureau for Economic Research  said on their websites today.  “This continues to suggest that despite much specific
hardship, there were large pockets of South African consumers
who recovered quickly from recession and crisis,” First
National Bank’s Chief Economist  Cees Bruggemans  said in the
statement.  Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
expenditure in the economy, has been slow to recover from last
year’s recession. The Reserve Bank will cut its key interest
 rate  by half a percentage point to 5.5 percent on Nov. 19
according 17 of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
reduction would be its ninth since December 2008.  While the confidence index among those earning more than
10,000 rand ($1,428) a month was at 23, those earning below
2,000 rand a month had an index level of zero, according to the
statement.  Retails sales growth slowed to 4.6 percent in August, half
the pace of the month before when the soccer World Cup boosted
sales of food, drinks and clothing, Statistics South Africa said
on Oct. 13.  An increase in spending may help to spur  economic growth ,
which slowed to an annualized 3.2 percent in the second quarter
from 4.6 percent in the previous three months. The Reserve Bank
expects the economy to expand 2.8 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
