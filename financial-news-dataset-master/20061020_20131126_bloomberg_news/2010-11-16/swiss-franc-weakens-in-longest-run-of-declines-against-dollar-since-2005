The Swiss franc weakened for an
eighth day against the dollar, the longest run of declines since
2005, as investors bet that bond purchases by the Federal
Reserve will fuel U.S. inflation while domestic prices drop.  The franc also fell versus the euro even after the common
currency dropped against the dollar for the second day. U.S. 10-
year Treasuries yielded 143 basis points more than their Swiss
counterparts, near the most in more than two months. Swiss
prices for products ranging from factory to farm goods as well
as imports dropped last month, the government said yesterday.  “Interest-rate differentials have moved in favor of the
dollar quite significantly,” said  Marcus Hettinger , a currency
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. That’s why “in
this risk-aversion environment, the dollar increases even
against the Swiss franc.”  The franc depreciated 0.8 percent to 99.25 centimes per
dollar as of 5 p.m. in London. It reached 99.35 centimes
earlier, the weakest level since Nov. 1. The streak is the
longest since the eight days ended Feb. 7, 2005. Against the
euro, the Swiss currency declined by 0.3 percent to 1.3413.  Switzerland’s producer and import prices fell by 0.4
percent in October, after declining by 0.1 percent a month
earlier, the Neuchatel, Switzerland-based Federal Statistics
Office said yesterday. Treasury yields, which fell today, jumped
31 basis points during the previous two trading days, the most
since a back-to-back surge of 33 basis points in January 2009.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  tumbled 2.3 percent, the biggest
decline in four months, as Ireland held talks over a possible
rescue from the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
