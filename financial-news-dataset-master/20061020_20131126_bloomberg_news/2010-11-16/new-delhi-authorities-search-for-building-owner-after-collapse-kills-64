New Delhi authorities searched for
the owner of a building that collapsed and killed 66 people, the
Press Trust of India reported, as the city’s administration
blamed unauthorized construction for the accident.  Local channels aired images of rescue workers pulling
bodies and the injured out of the rubble of the four-story
building that housed migrant workers and their families in the
eastern part of New Delhi. About 130 people were wounded and at
least 10 are still trapped under the debris, PTI reported.  “We will punish acts of negligence and officials
responsible for this,” New Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit
told reporters earlier in televised comments at the site, after
ordering an inquiry.  The city’s police have registered a case of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder against the missing owner, the
PTI said, citing a law enforcement official it didn’t name.  Recent monsoon rains and flooding from the neighboring
Yamuna river may have resulted in seepage and weakened the
building’s foundation, PTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
