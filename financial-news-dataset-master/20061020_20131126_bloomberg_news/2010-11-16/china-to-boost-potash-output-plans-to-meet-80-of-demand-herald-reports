China is planning to increase
domestic production of potash as demand for the fertilizer rises,
the 21st Century Business Herald  reported , citing an industry
official.  In the longer term, the nation should ensure local output
supplies at least 80 percent of demand, the report cited Liu
Fuchang, secretary general of the potash unit in the  China
Inorganic Salts Industry Association , as saying. Liu didn’t
define what was meant by longer term. China currently imports as
much as 70 percent of its potash demand, the newspaper said.  The five-year plan for China’s potash industry will be made
public as early as January, it said.  -- Xiao Yu . Editors:  Andrew Hobbs ,  Alan Soughley   To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
