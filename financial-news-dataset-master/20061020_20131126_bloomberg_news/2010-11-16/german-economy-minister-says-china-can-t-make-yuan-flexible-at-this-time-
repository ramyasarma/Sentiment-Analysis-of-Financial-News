German Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle said he doesn’t think China can have a flexible yuan
at the moment and called for a cooling in rhetoric over currency
fluctuations.  “I think they need verbal disarmament,” he said today at
a news conference in Rome, referring to tensions over volatility
in exchange rates. “If the Chinese were to put the dollars
they have on the market, we would have grave problems. I don’t
think the Chinese can have a flexible exchange at this time.”  He said the yuan “is undervalued” and that China “should
partially revalue it.”  The minister also said he’s “somewhat concerned” about
what he called the U.S. “policy of strong liquidity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
