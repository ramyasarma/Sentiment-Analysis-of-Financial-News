Regulators should conduct new stress
tests on banks because legal challenges to  foreclosures  and
uncertainties in the housing market could threaten the financial
system, a congressional watchdog said.  “If document irregularities prove to be pervasive and,
more importantly, throw into question ownership of not only
 foreclosed properties  but also pooled mortgages, the result
could be significant harm to the financial stability,” the
Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief
Program said in a report today.  “Bank regulators should also conduct new stress tests on
Wall Street banks to measure their ability to deal with a
potential crisis,” the report continued.  The attorneys general in all 50 states last month opened an
investigation into whether banks and loan servicers used faulty
documents or improper practices to foreclose on homes. President
 Barack Obama  has rejected calls for a nationwide moratorium on
foreclosures, saying it could hurt the housing recovery.  The nation’s biggest mortgage lenders say they are
addressing problems to the system and federal regulators have
stepped up efforts to protect borrowers. That doesn’t address
potential long-term risk to the system, the panel found.  “In the worst-case scenario, a clear chain of title -- an
essential element of a functioning housing market -- may be
difficult to establish for properties subject to mortgage loans
that were pooled and securitized,” according to the report.  The panel, led by Senator  Ted Kaufman , a Delaware Democrat,
singled out one investor demand that could seek to force Bank of
America Corp. to repurchase and absorb partial losses on $47
billion in loans.  ‘Disabling Damage’  “If several similar-sized actions -- whether motivated by
concerns about underwriting or loan ownership -- were to
succeed, the company could suffer disabling damage to its
regulatory capital,” the panel found.  Mortgage servicers “who have failed to follow the law must
be held accountable,” Treasury spokesman  Mark Paustenbach  said
in an e-mail in response to the oversight panel’s report.
“That’s why the administration has led a coordinated
interagency effort to investigate misconduct, protect homeowners
and mitigate any long-term effects on the housing market.”  Phyllis Caldwell , chief of the Treasury’s Homeownership
Preservation Office, told the oversight panel in a hearing last
month that “at this stage there appears to be no evidence of
systemic risk.”  A bondholder group represented by  Kathy Patrick , a lawyer
with Houston-based Gibbs & Bruns LLP, is pushing Charlotte-based
Bank of America to repurchase home loans. The bank said in a
Nov. 4 letter to Patrick that she had failed “to set forth a
single fact in support of any of your allegations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
