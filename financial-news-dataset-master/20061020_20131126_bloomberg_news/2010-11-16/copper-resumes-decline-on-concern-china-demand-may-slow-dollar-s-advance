Copper in London resumed a decline
as the dollar’s rebound hurt demand for commodities priced in
the U.S. currency amid the potential for slowing demand in
China, the world’s largest user. The metal pared early gains in
Shanghai.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.9 percent to $8,570 a metric ton, and
traded at $8,595 a ton by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time.  February-delivery metal gained 0.3 percent to 65,130 yuan a
ton, after rising as much as 0.9 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
