Crude oil may plunge below $80 a
barrel in New York as the failure of its relative strength index
to keep pace with price gains signals that this month’s rally is
over, according to technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Futures surged to a two-year high of $88.63 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange on Nov. 11. On that day, oil’s 14-
day RSI, a measure of how rapidly prices rise or fall in that
period, failed to surpass a nine-month peak reached in October.
That indicates the gains have run their course and a downward
correction may be imminent, Commerzbank said.  “This suggests a loss of upside momentum,” London-based
analyst  Karen Anne Jones  said in an interview.  Oil, which traded for $83.47 at 14:19 p.m. London time,
earlier today broke a trend-line that has supported prices since
September at $83.88, and is set to plummet, Jones said. The 14-
day RSI was at 50.8.  “The market is sitting today on the two-month uptrend, and
this is now exposed,” she said. “Failure looks likely and will
spell a deeper retracement.”  Once crude drops below $83.88 it will be drawn toward a
range of $78.50 to $79.31 within three weeks, according to
Commerzbank. This price band combines a threshold from the
Fibonacci sequence of numbers, with the convergence point of two
moving averages.  A move to the $78.50-$79.31 area would complete a 38.2
percent reversal of oil’s advance since May, Jones said. The
significance of a 38.2 percent movement derives from the
Fibonacci sequence, used by traders to predict points of
resistance and support as markets repeat earlier moves.  This region is also where crude’s 100-day and 200-day
averages cross. The 100-day and 200-day rolling mean are both at
$78.57 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
