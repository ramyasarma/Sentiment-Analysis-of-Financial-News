The yield on Brazil’s most-traded
interest-rate futures contract reached a 15-week high on bets
the central bank may increase its benchmark rate next year to
curb inflation.  The yield on the contract maturing in January 2012 added 9
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 11.61 percent at 3
p.m. New York time. It’s the highest yield since Aug. 4.  A central bank survey published today showed economists
expect policy makers will raise the overnight rate more than
previously predicted in 2011 to 12 percent to contain inflation,
contrasting with Finance Minister  Guido Mantega ’s comments
in a Nov. 13 interview that benchmark interest rates may fall
next year.  Consumer prices  in Latin America’s biggest economy
climbed more than forecast in October, driving inflation to an
eight-month high, the country’s statistics office said Nov. 9.  “Inflation expectations are rising and there is more room
for rates to increase; the market’s not buying the idea of a
drop in the interest rate next year,”  Rodolfo Cavalheiro , a
currency trader at Banco Modal SA, which manages assets worth
1.05 billion reais ($606.2 million), said from Rio de Janeiro.  Brazil’s benchmark Selic rate of 10.75 percent compares
with 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in Japan. The
higher yield has spurred a 33 percent rally in the real versus
the dollar since the start of 2009.  Real Slides  Brazil’s currency weakened for a seventh day versus the
dollar as commodities prices fell on concern China may take
further steps to cool economic growth. The currency depreciated
1.1 percent to 1.7416 per dollar from a previous close of 1.7222
on Nov. 12. The market was closed for a holiday yesterday.  The central bank survey showed economists expect policy
makers to raise the Selic to 12 percent by September 2011 after
increases in April and June. Analysts predict consumer prices
will rise 5.48 percent this year and 5.05 percent in 2011.  The IPCA consumer price index rose 0.75 percent in October
from September, its biggest increase since February, taking the
annual inflation rate to 5.20 percent. The central bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus 2 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on the story:
