Research In Motion Ltd., preparing
to release its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet next quarter, said the
device is faster than Apple Inc.’s iPad.  “Go to YouTube and see it, it’s fast,” RIM Co-Chief
Executive Officer Jim Balsillie said, referring to  the video  RIM
posted that compares browsing speeds on the two devices. “It’s
self-evident when shown,” Balsillie said in
remarks at the Web 2.0 conference today in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
