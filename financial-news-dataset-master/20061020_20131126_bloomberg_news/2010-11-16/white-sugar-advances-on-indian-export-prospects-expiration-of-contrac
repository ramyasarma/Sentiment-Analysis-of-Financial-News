Sugar declined amid concern that
China will take steps to curb accelerating consumer prices,
damping demand for commodities. Coffee fell the most in six
weeks, and cocoa slumped.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
tumbled as much as 3.2 percent today, led by wheat and nickel.
China’s Premier Wen Jiabao said that the cabinet is drafting
measures to counter the fastest inflation in two years. The
dollar advanced against the euro on Irish debt concerns, eroding
the appeal of raw materials as alternative assets.  “People are concerned that China will take steps to
control food inflation,” said Craig Ruffolo, a senior vice
president at McKeany-Flavell Co., a broker in Oakland,
California. “Also, there is selling pressure because of news
from Ireland.”  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 0.72 cent, or 2.7
percent, to settle at 26.31 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. On Nov. 12, the price plunged 12
percent, the most since July 1988, partly on concern that China
may raise lending rates.  Earlier, the commodity gained as much as 2.8 percent on
speculation that India may limit exports.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery fell
$10.40, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $666.70 a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Coffee, Cocoa  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery declined 6.75
