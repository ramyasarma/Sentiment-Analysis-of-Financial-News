BHP Billiton Ltd., Rio Tinto Group,
Leighton Holdings Ltd., Santos Ltd. and other companies say a
Treasury rewrite of foreign tax rules will raise their costs of
insurance by 30 percent, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing submissions on the proposal. The changes, which
are part of a project to simplify foreign tax rules, will deny
companies tax deductions for premiums paid to their insurance
subsidiaries and increase their reliance on the commercial
insurance market, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
