Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
cabinet is drafting measures to counter overly rapid price gains,
suggesting intensified government efforts to combat the fastest
inflation in two years.  Wen’s comments at a Guangzhou, Guangdong, supermarket were
broadcast on state television. He didn’t elaborate, beyond
urging local governments to ensure market supply and order.  Yuan Trade Settlement to Surge  Yuan trade settlement in Hong Kong may rise 40-fold in the
“medium term” as China relaxes capital controls, said  K. C. Chan , the city’s secretary for financial services and the
treasury.  Hong Kong is now seeing about 40 billion yuan ($6 billion)
of trade settled in the Chinese currency a year, said Chan,
according to a  transcript  of remarks to a conference in London
posted on the government’s Web site.  Venezuela-China Power  Venezuela is in talks with China for 3,000 megawatts of new
electricity projects as it seeks to boost production capacity
following a crisis earlier this year that forced power rationing
to avoid a collapse of the national grid.  Chinese companies may work on at least five projects to
build hydroelectric reservoirs and thermoelectric plants in
Venezuela as the nation seeks to boost capacity by 18,700
megawatts, Electricity Minister  Ali Rodriguez  said in an
interview in Caracas, without identifying the companies.  H.K. Currency Peg to Stay  Hong Kong’s currency peg to the U.S. dollar is a “firm
anchor” for the special administrative region and China’s
currency won’t meet the conditions needed to replace the
greenback for a “very long time,” said  Eddie Yue , deputy chief
executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  The Hong Kong dollar has been kept at about HK$7.80 versus
the dollar since 1983 and allowed to trade as much as 5 Hong
Kong cents of either side of that level since 2005. China
accounted for 18 percent of Hong Kong’s trade in 1983 and the
U.S. 21 percent, official figures show. China made up 49 percent
in the first nine months of 2010 and the U.S. 8 percent.  HSBC Salaries  HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest bank, may as much as
double the base salary of some investment bankers following
similar increases by competitors, said a person with knowledge
of the plans.  While hundreds of bankers at HSBC’s securities unit will
get a rise in base pay, their total pay won’t increase because
bonuses will be cut, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. London-based HSBC’s
Global Banking and Markets unit employs about 22,000 people.  Collective Shoes in China  Collective Brands Inc.  is planning to take its Stride Rite
children’s shoe brand to the world’s most populous market,
opening stores in mainland China next year, its chief executive
officer said.  The company, based in Topeka, Kansas, is teaming up with Li
& Fung Retailing and will also open stores in Hong Kong,
Malaysia and Singapore starting in December,  Matthew Rubel  said
in a telephone interview. Li & Fung will develop stores, e-
commerce and wholesale business for Collective in Asia. Closely
held Li & Fung Retailing isn’t related to the publicly traded
company of similar name.  EU Tariffs on Melamine  The European Union imposed tariffs of as much as 65.2
percent on melamine from China to help Austrian, Dutch and
Polish producers compete against cheaper imports.  The duties punish Chinese manufacturers for selling the
chemical in the EU’s 400 million-euro ($550 million) market
below cost, a practice known as  dumping . Melamine is a raw
material used in resins, which strengthen and protect wood
surfaces of furniture, panels and floors.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks sank, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
to the biggest slump since August, amid concern that the debt
crisis in Ireland and Greece is worsening and that China will
act to slow its economy.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  and Nucor Corp. fell at
least 3.5 percent as metals plunged. Travelers Cos. dropped 3.6
percent, leading losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as
it slipped below 11,000 for the first time in a month, as
declines in municipal bonds hurt its investments.  Regions
Financial Corp.  slumped 4.5 percent after three executives
overseeing risk and souring assets at the bank quit.  The  S&P 500  decreased 1.6 percent to 1,178.34 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The drop follows a late-day selloff the previous day
triggered by growing criticism of the Federal Reserve’s plan to
spur growth using a technique called quantitative easing. The
Dow fell 178.47 points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,023.50. The MSCI
World Index of shares in 24 developed nations slumped for a
seventh straight day, the longest losing streak since January.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Banks and developers: China’s interest-rate increase last
