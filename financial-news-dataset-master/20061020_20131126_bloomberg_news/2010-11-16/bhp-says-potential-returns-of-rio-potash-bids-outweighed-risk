BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, said the potential returns from its
failed $40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and
joint venture with Rio Tinto Group outweighed the risks.  “Your board has an obligation to look for options that
create shareholder value,” Chairman  Jac Nasser  said in speech
notes for the Melbourne-based company’s annual meeting being
held today in Perth. “However, it is also our obligation to end
transactions when the board believes shareholder value cannot be
delivered.”  BHP yesterday resumed a share buyback program after
abandoning the offer for Potash Corp. in the face of Canadian
government opposition. BHP, the world’s third-largest producer
of iron ore, could spend as much as $25 billion on buying back
shares, according to Morgan Stanley.  BHP slipped 4 cents to A$44.10 at 2:02 p.m. Sydney time on
the Australian stock exchange. The stock has risen 2.3 percent
this year, compared with a 3.9 percent decline on the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  BHP will purchase $4.2 billion of its shares under a $13
billion buyback program suspended in 2007 when it made a hostile
$66 billion takeover bid for Rio Tinto that was also abandoned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
