German bonds stayed little changed
after a report showed German  investor confidence  unexpectedly
climbed for the first time in seven months in November.  The 10-year bund yield climbed one basis point to 2.58
percent as of 10:08 a.m. in London. Two-year yields were less
than one basis point higher at 1.05 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months ahead, increased to 1.8 from
minus 7.2 in October. Economists expected a gain to minus 6,
according to the median of 33 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
