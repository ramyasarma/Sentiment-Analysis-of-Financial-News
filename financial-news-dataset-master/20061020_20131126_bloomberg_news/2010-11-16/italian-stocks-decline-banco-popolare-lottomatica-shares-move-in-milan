Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) declined 2.45 cents, or 2.6 percent, to 92.1

markets closed.  Lottomatica SpA  (LTO IM) declined 1.1 euros, or 9.5
percent, to 10.45, the biggest retreat in 7 ½ years. Italy’s
biggest lottery company approved a refinancing plan, including
the sale of a senior bond for as much as 500 million euros and
the sale of a 12.5 stake in its Scratch & Win business for 100
euros. The sale of the stake is at a loss for shareholders,
Citigroup analyst  Mauro Baragiola  said in a note sent to clients
today.  Chief Financial Officer Stefano Bortoli said the
refinancing plan is “very timely” because capital market
conditions are “positive.”  Mediaset SpA  (MS IM), the broadcaster owned by Italian
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , dropped 22 cents, or 4.6
percent, to 4.59 euros, taking the loss in the past five

percent, to 2.39 euros.  Monti Ascensori SpA  (MSA IM) dropped 8.25 cents, or 8.9
percent, to 84 cents. The elevator manufacturer reported a nine-
month net loss of 3 million euros, compared with a profit a year
