India’s 12-year bond yields held at
the highest level in two weeks as a cash crunch at the nation’s
banks sapped demand for debt.  Local lenders have been  borrowing  more than 1 trillion
rupees ($22 billion) each day since Nov. 8 from the Reserve Bank
of India to meet cash shortages, central bank data show.
 Overnight  borrowing rates in the nation’s money market have
averaged 6.3 percent this quarter, up from 5.4 percent in the
previous three months, as record share sales by local companies
drained money from the financial system.  “The tight liquidity in the banking system is the main
factor that’s holding bonds back,” said  Mukesh Kumar , a fixed-
income trader at State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 was
little changed at 8.06 percent, the most since Nov. 1, as of the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The price was at 100.51 per 100 rupee face amount.  Indian bonds returned 4 percent this year, the third-worst
performance among 10 Asian local-currency debt markets outside
Japan, indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, declined two basis points to
6.71 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
