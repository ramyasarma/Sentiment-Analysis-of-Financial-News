The pound rose versus the dollar and
erased its decline against the euro after a report showed
 inflaton  unexpectedly accelerated in October.  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to $1.6081 as of 8:35 a.m. in
London and was little changed at 84.65 pence per euro after
weakening 0.3 percent.  Consumer prices increased 3.2 percent from a year earlier,
the Office for National Statistics said today in London. That
exceeded the 3.1 percent result in September, which was also the
median forecast of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
