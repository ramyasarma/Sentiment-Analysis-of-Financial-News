A surge in the municipal-bond supply
creates the best buying opportunity in two years, said  Michael Pietronico , chief executive officer at New York-based Miller
Tabak Asset Management.  Oversupply has meant a slow market and higher yields as
issuers rush to sell federally subsidized Build America Bonds
before the program’s expiration at year’s end, Pietronico, who
manages $330 million in municipal holdings, said in a telephone
interview today.  “Rates will drop noticeably once the pressure to issue
Build America Bonds has passed,” Pietronico said.  The U.S. pays 35 percent of the interest on taxable Build
America Bonds. The program, created as part of President  Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus, hasn’t been extended.  The secondary market, in which previously issued bonds are
bought and sold, showed top-rated debt yields at 4 percent in
the 10-year range, Pietronico said. Yields could begin to fall
in mid-December, Pietronico said.  “Rates will stop going up when money starts coming out of
the stock market and into the muni market, which we’re seeing
the beginning of now,” Pietronico said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
