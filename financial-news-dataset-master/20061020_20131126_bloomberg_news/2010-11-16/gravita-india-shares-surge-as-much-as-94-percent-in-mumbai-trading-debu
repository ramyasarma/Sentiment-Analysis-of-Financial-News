Gravita India Ltd. , an Indian lead-
recycling company, jumped 68 percent on its trading debut in
Mumbai after demand exceeded the shares on sale in its initial
public offer by 42.2 times.  The shares rose to 209.7 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai after  climbing  as much as 104 percent to 255 rupees
earlier. The company raised 450 million rupees ($10 million)
selling 3.6 million shares at 125 rupees each earlier this month.  Gravita, which manufactures lead products such as sheets
and pipes from smelting and recycling ore, lead concentrate and
batteries, will use proceeds from the IPO to expand its
operations in the northwestern city of Jaipur and set up a new
facility at Wada in the state Maharashtra, Managing Director
Rajat Agarwal told reporters in Mumbai today.  Gravita will also invest the funds in ventures overseas in
Sri Lanka, Honduras and Senegal, he said. The company, which
plans to set up units in Australia, Belarus, Chile and Mexico,
will almost double its manufacturing capacity to 62,000 metric
tons in about a year, Agarwal said.  The company, which sells lead to battery manufacturers
such as  Exide Industries Ltd.  and  Amara Raja Batteries Ltd. ,
expects profit of as much as 240 million rupees on sales of 3.2
billion rupees in the year ending March 31. Profit more than
doubled to 140 million rupees last year.  “We expect revenue and profit to more than double in the
next two years,” Agarwal said.  Indian companies have raised about 335 billion rupees from
54 initial public offers so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
