Yields on  top-rated tax-exempt  bonds
due in 10 years climbed to a four-month high as the market
absorbed the  highest weekly issuance  of municipal debt in at
least seven years.  Ten-year AAA general obligations jumped 0.04 percentage
point to 2.67 percent at 11:07 a.m. in New York, the highest
since July 9, according to a BVAL municipal benchmark index.
States and local governments are selling $16.3 billion in debt
this week, the most on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg dating to 2003.  “We’re going to need a bigger boat,”  Tony Shields , a
principal in the public-finance department at Williams Capital
Group in New York, said in an e-mail. “New supply is close to
unmanageable.”  Municipal yields rose on most maturities, with the biggest
moves, from 7 to 10 basis points, on debt due from 21 to 25
years, BVAL indexes show. Yields on bonds maturing in a year
fell  4 basis points , as investors took up defensive position
against potential future inflation. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
