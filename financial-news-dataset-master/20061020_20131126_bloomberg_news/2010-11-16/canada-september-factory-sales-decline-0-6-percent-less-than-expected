Canadian factory  sales  fell less
than economists  forecast  in September, as automobile demand
tumbled while primary metal, petroleum and coal receipts
increased.  Sales fell 0.6 percent to C$45.1 billion ($44.4 billion),
the third decline in four months, Statistics Canada said today
in Ottawa. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted a 0.9
percent drop, based on the median of 20 estimates.  Factory sales are down from a peak of C$53.2 billion set in
July 2008 before a global recession eroded demand for Canadian
automobiles and lumber. The Bank of Canada last month cut its
economic growth forecast in part because of signs of a slower
global rebound, and future factory sales may also be curbed by
the Canadian dollar’s rise to parity with the U.S. currency
earlier this month.  “The headwinds are certainly there” for manufacturing,
said  Francis Fong , economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “We have
a moderating domestic economy.”  The Bank of Canada won’t raise interest rates until after
the first quarter of next year, Fong said, after it paused on
Oct. 19 following three prior increases to 1 percent. The
Federal Reserve said Nov. 3 it would buy another $600 billion of
Treasuries to boost demand, and Canada’s central bank should
wait until there’s a stronger U.S. recovery to act again, Fong
said.  ‘Risks to Trade’  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.9 percent to C$1.0191 per
U.S. dollar at 9:40 a.m. in Toronto, the weakest in more than
two weeks, compared with C$1.0099 yesterday. One Canadian dollar
buys 98.11 U.S. cents.  “A slowing U.S. economy and further Canadian dollar
appreciation could pose further downside risks to trade and
manufacturing over the remainder of 2010 and into 2011,”  Gorica Djeric , an economist at Scotia Capital in Toronto, wrote in a
note to clients.  Sales fell in 13 of  21 categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, led by a 7.5 percent drop in transportation equipment to
C$7 billion. Within the transport category, motor vehicle sales
fell 10.4 percent to C$3.6 billion. Fabricated metal products
dropped 2 percent and paper sales declined 1.8 percent.  Transcontinental Closures  Transcontinental Inc. said Oct. 27 it’s closing a printing
plant with 180 workers in Boucherville, Quebec, citing decreased
demand for books, catalogues and magazines.  Petroleum and coal sales rose 6.2 percent to C$5.8 billion,
and primary metal sales increased 3.3 percent to C$3.6 billion.  Excluding automobiles and parts, sales rose 0.6 percent to
C$39.9 billion, Statistics Canada said.  New factory orders fell 4.9 percent to C$44 billion, and
unfilled orders decreased 1.9 percent to C$53.6 billion.  Inventories fell 0.2 percent to C$60.5 billion, the first
decline in four months. The ratio of inventories to sales, a
measure of how many months it would take to deplete stockpiles,
was unchanged at 1.34 in September.  Statistics Canada pared its estimate of the factory sales
decrease for July, to 0.4 percent from an earlier report of 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
