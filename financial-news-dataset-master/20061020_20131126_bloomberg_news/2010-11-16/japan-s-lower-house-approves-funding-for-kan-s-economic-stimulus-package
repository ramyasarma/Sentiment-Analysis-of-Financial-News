Japan’s lower house of parliament
approved legislation to fund Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s 5.1
trillion yen ($60 billion) stimulus package, overcoming
objections from opposition lawmakers.  The Diet today passed a 4.4 trillion yen supplementary
budget to fund Kan’s plan to fight  deflation  and combat the
stronger yen. The remainder will come through cost cuts and the
frontloading of public works projects. The bill becomes law
within 30 days even if the upper house, where the ruling
 Democratic Party of Japan  lacks a majority, rejects it.  About 3.1 trillion yen of the package goes toward assisting
regional economies and small businesses. The package includes an
undefined amount to find new sources of rare earth metals after
Japan said China disrupted shipments following a territorial
dispute.  The DPJ had to overcome delaying tactics in passing the
measure, last night voting down motions of no-confidence against
two of Kan’s Cabinet ministers. Opposition lawmakers submitted
the motions over the leak of a video showing the collision
between a Chinese fishing boat and two Japanese Coast Guard
vessels near islands claimed by both countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
