Estonian Finance Minister Jurgen
Ligi said Ireland’s debt problems are unlikely to spread to
other European countries.  “I don’t see contagion as a concern because those in
trouble have created their own problems, although of course this
atmosphere is reinforcing itself,” Ligi said in an interview
today in Brussels before a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers. “Ireland’s fundamental problems are not as serious
as those of some others.”  A deal on aid for Ireland can “probably” be reached
today, said Ligi, who is attending today’s meeting as his
country prepares to join the euro area at the start of next
year. “A system for rescuing countries has been created, and
readiness is there in the sense that doubts about the need for
it have been dispersed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
