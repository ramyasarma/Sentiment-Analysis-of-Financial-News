Rabobank Nederland NV sold 100
million euros ($136 million) of notes linked to the 30-year euro
swap rate.  The 10-year securities pay a coupon equivalent to the swap
rate minus 50 basis points with payments capped at 7.5 percent a
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Noteholders get
their money back at maturity.  The 30-year swap rate, the cost to exchange fixed for
variable-rate interest payments, has risen to 3.08 percent from
a record low 2.52 percent on Aug. 27, according to composite
prices on Bloomberg. The securities were marketed to retail
investors in the Netherlands and are quoted with a 1 percent
spread between the bid and offer prices.  Structured notes are securities that package debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to investors while earning
fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is
derived from stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
