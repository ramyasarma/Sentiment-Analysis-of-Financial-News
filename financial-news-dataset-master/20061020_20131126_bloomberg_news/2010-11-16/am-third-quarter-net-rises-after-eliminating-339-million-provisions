Tam SA , Brazil’s biggest airline by
market share, said third-quarter net income rose more than
threefold, lifted by a legal victory and growing demand. The
company raised its forecast for air travel.  Net income  rose to 740 million reais ($428 million) from
228.4 million reais a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Tam said
today in a regulatory filing. Sales increased 23 percent to
2.94 billion reais.  In September, Tam eliminated provisions of 585.9 million
reais after a Brazilian court reversed a decision requiring an
additional payment equal to 1 percent on all tickets sold from
June 2001 to August 2010. Net income adjusted for the reversal
of the provision rose 32 percent to 300.5 million euros.  The company increased its  forecast  for 2010 domestic air
travel because of “stronger-than-expected growth.” Tam said it
sees demand growing 22 percent to 25 percent, up from its
previous 14 percent to 18 percent forecast. The company’s
forecast for its full-year load factor, or the portion of seats
filled, was unchanged from August at 69 percent.  Brazil’s domestic air demand grew 27 percent in the third
quarter, while capacity rose 20 percent from year earlier, Tam
said. International air demand climbed 28 percent in Brazil
compared with a 12 percent increase in capacity.  Lan Airlines SA , Latin America’s biggest carrier by market
value, agreed to buy Tam in a $3.7 billion transaction in
August. The deal still needs regulatory approval. Tam rose 0.8
percent to 41 reais on Nov. 12, the most recent trading day in
Sao Paulo. Tam shares have  climbed  7.8 percent this year
compared with a 2.6 percent gain for the Bovespa benchmark
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
