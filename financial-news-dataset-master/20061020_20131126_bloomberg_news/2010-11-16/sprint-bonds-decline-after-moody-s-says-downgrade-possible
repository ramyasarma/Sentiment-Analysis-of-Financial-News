Sprint Nextel Corp.  bonds fell to
the lowest in more than two months after Moody’s Investors
Service said yesterday it is reviewing whether to cut its rating
on the third-largest U.S. mobile phone carrier.  Sprint’s $2.475 billion of 6.875 percent notes due in
November 2028 fell 1.6 cents on the dollar to 86.4 cents at 8:29
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The
securities have declined 7.8 cents this month and are at the
lowest price since Sept. 8, Trace data show.  Moody’s, which ranks the Overland Park, Kansas company Ba2,
cited “weak, albeit slowly improving, operating performance
combined with a further deterioration in its relationship” with
Clearwire, according to a statement yesterday.  Sprint has a 54 percent stake in Kirkland, Washington-based
wireless broadband operator Clearwire, which said Nov. 4 that it
didn’t have enough funding to keep operating, prompting investor
concern that a default could trigger a contract provision
pulling Sprint into default as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
