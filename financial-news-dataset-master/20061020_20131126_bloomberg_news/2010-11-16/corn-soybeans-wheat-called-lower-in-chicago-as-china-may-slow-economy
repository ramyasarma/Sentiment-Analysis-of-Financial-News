What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called 9 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade on concern that China plans to crack
down on speculation in agricultural commodities and increase
interest rates, said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Soybean futures may open 25 cents to 30 cents lower on bets
that economic growth may slow in China, Roose said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $5 to $7 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open down 1.2 cents to 1.5 cents a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as U.S. demand might ease, Roose said. Rain this
week in the Midwest should aid winter crops before dormancy, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
