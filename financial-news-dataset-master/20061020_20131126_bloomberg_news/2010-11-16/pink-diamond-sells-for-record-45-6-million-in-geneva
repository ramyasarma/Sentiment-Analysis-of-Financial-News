Laurence Graff , a London jewelry
dealer, last night bought a diamond in a Swiss sale for 45.4
million francs ($45.6 million), a record for any gem at auction.  Graff’s telephone bid for the pink stone beat an estimate
of 27 million francs to 38 million francs at  Sotheby’s , Geneva.  “It is the most fabulous diamond I’ve seen in my career,”
Graff said in a statement issued by Sotheby’s. He named the gem
“the Graff Pink,” the auction house said.  The jewelry auction raised a record 103 million francs,
Sotheby’s said. Demand for rare gems as a portable form of
wealth has pushed up prices.  The 24.78-carat emerald-cut stone was graded “Fancy
Intense Pink” by the Gemological Institute of America. It was
sold by a private collector and hadn’t been seen on the open
market since being bought from Harry Winston about 60 years ago,
the New York-based auction house said.  “What makes it so immensely rare is the combination of its
exceptional color and purity with the classic emerald-cut,”
 David Bennett , chairman of Sotheby’s European and the Middle
Eastern jewelry departments, said in a statement. “It’s a style
of cutting normally associated with white diamonds and one that
is so highly sought-after when found in rare colors such as pink
and blue.”  Graff previously paid 16.4 million pounds ($24.3 million)
for the 35.56-carat grayish-blue “Wittelsbach Diamond” at
 Christie’s International  in London in December 2008, then the
highest for a gem at auction.  Geneva Wine Record  Earlier in the day at a Christie’s wine sale, also in
Geneva, a 6-liter imperial of Chateau Cheval Blanc’s 1947
vintage sold for 298,500 francs. The  price , paid by an
unidentified collector, was an auction record for a large-format
bottle of wine. An imperial bottle is the size of eight standard
bottles.  Described by Christie’s wine specialist, Michael Ganne, as
“probably the only known existing ‘imperial’” of the red
Bordeaux, it had been estimated to fetch between 150,000 francs
and 250,000 francs. Cheval Blanc’s famously port-like 1947
vintage is regarded by some connoisseurs as the greatest wine of
the 20th century.  The auction record for a standard-sized 75-centiliter
bottle of wine was set at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong on Oct. 29 when
three bottles of Chateau Lafite’s 1869 vintage each sold for
HK$1.8 million ($230,000). All three were bought by the same
Asian telephone bidder, said Sotheby’s.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes for Muse, the arts and culture
