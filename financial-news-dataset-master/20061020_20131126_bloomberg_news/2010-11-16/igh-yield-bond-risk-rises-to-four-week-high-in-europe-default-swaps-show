The cost of insuring against losses
on European high-yield corporate bonds rose to the highest level
in four weeks, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly junk credit ratings climbed 10 basis
points to 464, the highest since Oct. 20, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 10 a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for
the cost of protecting bonds against default and an increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 1.25 basis points to 102.75,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked
to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers up 1.25 at 133.75
and the subordinated index 3 higher at 210.5.  The cost of insuring sovereign debt also rose, according to
data provider CMA. Contracts on Ireland increased 17 basis
points to 510, Greece climbed 13 to 871, Italy was 2 higher at
183 and Portugal was up 1 at 414. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western
Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments rose 1 to 162.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
