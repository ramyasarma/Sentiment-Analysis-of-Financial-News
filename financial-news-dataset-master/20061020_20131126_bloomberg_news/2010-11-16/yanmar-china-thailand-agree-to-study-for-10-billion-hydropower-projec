China, Myanmar and Thailand agreed
to study a $10 billion hydropower project that would be
Southeast Asia’s largest by generation capacity, the Chinese
government said.  The 7-gigawatt project would be built on the Salween River
in Myanmar over 15 years, China’s State-owned Assets Supervision
and Administration Commission said in a statement on its website
today. Companies from the three countries signed an accord on
the project on Nov. 10, according to the statement.  China, the world’s largest energy consumer, is planning to
add hydropower capacity in its southern provinces such as Yunnan
and help build hydro dams in neighboring countries including
Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia to meet demand from the region. The
Asian Development Bank in September raised its 2010 economic
growth forecast for Asia, excluding Japan, to 8.2 percent.  “Asia’s power demand is set to rise with the economy, and
Chinese developers are keen to tap the rich hydro resources in
Southeast Asia to fuel regional growth,” said Dave Dai, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  China Three Gorges Corp., Sinohydro Corp. and China
Southern Power Grid Co. will work with the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand and the International Group of
Entrepreneur Co. in Myanmar on the study, according to the
statement.  From its headwaters in the Tibetan plateau, the 2,800-
kilometer (1,740-mile) Salween traverses Yunnan and Myanmar
before emptying into the Andaman Sea. The river is known as Nu
Jiang in China.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
