Microsoft Corp.  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer  and Chairman  Bill Gates , responding to a
request to consider breaking up the company to boost the return
for investors, say they aren’t in favor of the idea.  The executives made the remarks after a question at an
investor meeting in Bellevue, Washington.  Microsoft , which makes
most of its money from its Office and Windows computer software,
also offers everything from Xbox video-game machines to mobile-
phone programs to Hotmail Web e-mail services.  A breakup doesn’t make sense because the computer industry
is consolidating, Ballmer said. “I don’t think it would be
useful,” he said. “It creates economic dis-synergies.”  In October, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suggested that
Microsoft might spin off some consumer businesses, including the
Xbox division, so that it could better focus on its main
products. Microsoft’s shares have tumbled 15 percent this year,
hurt by concern that it’s losing ground to mobile software from
 Apple Inc.  and Google Inc. A slow recovery among corporate
customers also is weighing on sales, Goldman Sachs said.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23 cents to
$25.81 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
