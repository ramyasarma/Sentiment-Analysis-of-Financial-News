Senate Republicans and Democrats
voted to return their top party leaders to their jobs after the
midterm elections that netted Republicans a six-seat gain in the
chamber.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, was
returned to his post after winning a re-election fight against
Republican Sharron Angle, a favorite of Tea Party activists.
Republicans, in a separate closed-door meeting, voted to keep
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as minority leader. McConnell wasn’t
up for re-election to his seat this year.  When the new congressional session convenes in early
January, Democrats will control the Senate with 53 votes while
Republicans will have 47.  Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois was returned to his job
as the majority whip, the No. 2 leader among Democrats and a job
that includes helping to set the agenda and count votes. Senator
Charles Schumer of New York will continue in the third-ranking
slot as vice chairman of the caucus, helping to oversee strategy
and join in setting policy. Senator Patty Murray of Washington
will continue as Democratic conference secretary.  Among Republicans, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona will continue
as minority whip and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee will
serve again as the party’s conference chairman. Senator John
Thune of South Dakota will be the policy committee chairman;
Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming will be the conference vice
chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
