South Africa’s market for high-yield
bonds is likely to increase tenfold in the next five years as
banks hurt by the credit crisis continue to limit funding,
forcing companies to issue debt, said Investec Asset Management.  The market for high-yield, or non-investment grade, bonds
will probably increase to about 15 billion rand ($2.2 billion)
by end-2015, from about 1.5 billion rand currently, said  Steven Loubser , a Cape Town-based credit analyst at Investec Asset
Management, which oversees about $70 billion.  “Banks have less appetite for risk in the post-credit
crisis world,” said Loubser in an interview yesterday. “That
will push a lot of companies into the capital markets to source
their funding.”  High-yield bonds in South Africa typically yield between
3.5 percent and 7 percent more than the 3-month  Johannesburg
Interbank Agreed Rate , which fell to a record low of 5.855
percent today, Loubser said.  South African companies are selling the most debt since
Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1999 as falling borrowing
costs enable them to raise funding more cheaply. The yield on
the government’s benchmark 13.5 percent bond due September 2015
fell to a record low of 6.91 percent on Nov. 4, the lowest since
at least 2004 when Bloomberg began tracking the security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
