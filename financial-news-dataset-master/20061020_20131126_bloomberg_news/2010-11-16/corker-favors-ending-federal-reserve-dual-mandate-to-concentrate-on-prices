A Republican member of the Senate
Banking Committee called for the Federal Reserve to focus solely
on price stability rather than its “dual mandate” to fight
inflation and maintain full employment.  Tennessee Senator  Bob Corker  released his statement a day
after House Republican  Mike Pence  introduced legislation to
restrict the Fed’s activities to inflation fighting.  The central bank has embarked on a program of purchasing
$600 billion in Treasuries to inject more money into the economy
and promote job growth.  “It is time that we work to clarify the mandate of the
Federal Reserve,” Corker said in a statement issued a day after
he met with Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke . “Providing our central
bank with a clear and explicit focus on keeping inflation low
will serve America better than the broader mandate approach we
have today.”  Corker’s statement said he questioned Bernanke “on recent
actions by the Fed.”  House Republican Leader  John Boehner  of Ohio, who will
become speaker when the newly elected Congress convenes in
January, declined to comment today when asked whether he would
put Pence’s legislation to a vote.  The Fed cited low inflation in announcing its plan to
purchase government securities to put more money into the
economy and thereby encourage more lending to businesses. China
and Germany have criticized the Fed policy as aimed at devaluing
the dollar to promote U.S. exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
