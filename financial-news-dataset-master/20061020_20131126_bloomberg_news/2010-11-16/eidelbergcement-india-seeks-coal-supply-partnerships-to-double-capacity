HeidelbergCement India Ltd., a unit
of the world’s third-largest cement maker, is seeking to form
joint ventures to secure coal supplies for a planned 12 billion
rupee ($265 million) expansion.  The local unit of Germany’s Heidelberg AG plans to double
capacity to 6 million tons by 2012 to tap demand that is
expected to grow as much as 10 percent annually over the next
five years, Managing Director Ashish Guha said. The company used
coal worth 740 million rupees ($16 million) in 2009, according
to its annual report.  “We will have to link our coal supply to someone for long-
term supply or get into a joint venture to look into mining,”
Guha said in an interview. “Given our current capacity, coal
mine sizes are too large for us to mine on our own.”  HeidelbergCement India shares fell 1.6 percent to 48.55
rupees as of 2:34 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock has advanced 8
percent this year, compared with a 14 percent gain in the
benchmark index.  The company, based in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New
Delhi, has four plants in India.  Indian cement makers will add about 375 million metric tons
of capacity in the next five years as the government increases
spending on building highways, ports, airports and utilities,
Guha said. Asia’s third-largest economy needs to spend about $1
trillion on infrastructure from April 2012 to March 2017, twice
the amount the nation’s Planning Commission recommended in the
previous five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
