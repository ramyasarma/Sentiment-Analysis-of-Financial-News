Banco Popolare SC’s proposed 2
billion-euro rights offer will allow the lender to repay
government loans “as soon as possible” and save 123 million
euros a year in interest, Chief Executive Officer Pierfrancesco
Saviotti told daily Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview.  Popolare, which said six months ago it wouldn’t need new
financing, shifted strategy because the market changed after the
Greek crisis, the CEO said, making planned asset sales
difficult.  New Basel 3 requirements for lenders also factored into the
decision, Saviotti told Sole.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
