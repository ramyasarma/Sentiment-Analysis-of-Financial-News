New Zealand officials said a
kiwifruit vine disease has been found in parts of the nation’s
North Island beyond the Te Puke region where it was first
discovered.  Orchards in Napier, Edgecumbe and Whakatane have tested
positive, the Ministry of Agriculture said in an e-mailed
statement. Twenty five orchards across the North Island have the
disease, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
