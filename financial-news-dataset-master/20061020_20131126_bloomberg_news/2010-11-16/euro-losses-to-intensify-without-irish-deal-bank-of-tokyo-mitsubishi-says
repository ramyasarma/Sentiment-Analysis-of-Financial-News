The euro may drop should the
region’s finance ministers fail to agree on a plan to assist
Ireland and stabilize so-called peripheral bond markets at a
meeting today, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  “If euro-zone finance minister group chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker is correct and there is no plan agreed today, expect to
see renewed turmoil and euro selling to intensify,”  Derek Halpenny , head of European currency strategy in London, wrote in
an e-mailed research note today. “The stability of the
euro reflects increased optimism that the meeting will end with
the announcement of some form of bailout for Ireland.”  The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.3609 as of 9:24 a.m. in
London, after Ireland’s Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  signaled in
an interview with state broadcaster RTE that the country would
be willing to consider European Union measures to support its
banks.  Europe’s common currency has declined 1.2 percent against
the dollar in the past week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
