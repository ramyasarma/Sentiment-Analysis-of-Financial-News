GlaxoSmithKline Plc  and  Human Genome
Sciences Inc.  won a U.S. panel’s backing to sell the first new
lupus drug in more than 50 years. Human Genome’s shares jumped
9.5 percent in extended trading.  The medicine,  Benlysta , works well enough to outweigh risks
of suicide, infection and cancer, outside advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration said today in a 13-2 vote in Adelphi,
Maryland, drawing applause from lupus patients and advocates in
the audience. While the FDA isn’t required to follow its
advisory panels’ recommendations, it usually does.  Benlysta would be the first treatment approved since 1958
for  lupus , an incurable condition that causes the immune system
to attack healthy cells and affects about 5 million people
worldwide. London-based Glaxo and Human Genome, based in
Rockville, Maryland, expect a decision as early as Dec. 9. If
the drug is cleared, sales may surpass $2.1 billion by 2014,
according to the average  estimate  of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The efficacy is mild, but there is a need for a drug even
with mild efficacy, given the current state of therapies,”
panel member Lenore Buckley, a professor of internal medicine
and pediatrics at  Virginia Commonwealth University  in Richmond,
said before the vote.  Human Genome jumped $2.47, or 9.5 percent, to $28.35 at
6:16 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market extended trading.
Glaxo’s American depositary receipts  rose  $1.11, or 2.9 percent,
to $39.65 in New York trading. Each receipt equals two ordinary
shares of Glaxo.  1.5 Million Americans  About 1.5 million Americans have lupus, which claimed the
lives of novelist  Flannery O’Connor  and CBS television reporter
 Charles Kuralt . It’s most common in women ages 15 to 45 and
three times more prevalent in black women than white women,
according to the  Department of Health and Human Services .  Benlysta, an intravenous drug also known as  belimumab ,
inhibits the production of antibodies that attack healthy cells
in lupus patients. The treatment, if approved next month, may
become available in the first quarter of 2011,  Thomas Watkins ,
Human Genome’s chief executive officer, said after the meeting.  “Obviously we’re very pleased with today’s vote,” Watkins
said. “We will look forward to working with the FDA as they
complete their work” on the drug.  Approval ‘Almost Certain’  While Benlysta is “almost certain to be approved,” the
FDA may delay its decision up to three months beyond the Dec. 9
target date,  Geoffrey Porges , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. in New York, said today in a research note. The agency may
need extra time to consider labeling requirements, post-
marketing study obligations and risk-management strategies,
Porges said.  FDA clearance of Benlysta may “usher in a new era of
enlightenment” in lupus research,  Sandra Raymond , president of
the Washington-based  Lupus Foundation of America , said during a
public-comment session before the vote. Raymond was among more
than 30 speakers who urged the panel to recommend approval of
the drug.  Lupus symptoms range from mild to life-threatening,
complicating the development of drugs and clinical trials, said
Bonnie Bermas, director of the  Brigham & Women’s Hospital Lupus
Center  in Boston.  “One patient may have a low white blood-cell count, fluid
around their heart and skin rashes. Another patient could have
arthritis and central nervous symptoms, and a third patient
could have kidney disease,” Bermas said last month in a
telephone interview. “They can all look like very different
patients.”  Previous Trials  Roche Holding AG and  Biogen Idec Inc. ’s Rituxan, approved
for rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
failed a late-stage lupus trial last year.  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. ’s Edratide, Genelabs Technologies Inc.’s
Prestara and Riquent, developed by  La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co. 
and  BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.  are among the proposed lupus
treatments that also have fallen short.  The FDA is considering Benlysta based on a six-month
priority review. While the agency typically takes at least 10
months to decide drug applications, it grants  priority reviews 
to therapies that may provide major advances in treatment.  Benlysta ’s risks of suicide, infection and cancer were
greater than those in patients taking a placebo in clinical
trials, Food and Drug Administration staff reviewers said Nov.
12 in a preliminary  report . Data showing the drug was effective
lacked “robustness,” the agency staff said.  Unmet Medical Need  The drug is still likely to win approval because it met its
primary goal of reducing patients’ symptoms in two late-stage
clinical trials,  Christopher J. Raymond , an analyst with Robert
W. Baird & Co. in Chicago, said Nov. 12 in a telephone
interview. The FDA’s recognition of an unmet medical need for
more lupus therapies may outweigh agency staff’s concerns that
the drug may not be safe or effective enough, he said.  Benlysta, if approved, would be the first treatment
developed specifically for lupus. The steroid prednisone and
some antimalarial drugs were already approved for different
conditions when the FDA cleared them for use in lupus patients
more than 50 years ago.  The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide and Roche’s
CellCept, used in organ-transplant patients, are among
medications prescribed for lupus patients without FDA approval.
While FDA rules allow doctors to prescribe drugs for unapproved
purposes, companies can’t market the treatments for those so-
called off-label uses.  The long-term use of existing lupus treatments can have
debilitating side effects that are worse than the disease
itself, Sandra Raymond said, citing stroke, heart attacks, bone
loss, hypertension, infertility and infections.  Benlysta may not work for all lupus patients, Brigham &
Women’s Bermas said. Candidates may include people who have
failed previous treatments or require high doses of  prednisone 
to control their symptoms and want to lower the amount to
prevent side effects, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
