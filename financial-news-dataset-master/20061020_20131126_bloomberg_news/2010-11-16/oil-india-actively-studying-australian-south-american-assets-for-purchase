Oil India Ltd., a state-owned energy
explorer, is “actively” studying small assets in Australia,
South America and Africa as it competes for acquisitions with
overseas rivals to secure supplies for the country.  “We are looking for small and medium-size assets in the
range of $1 billion or less and not multibillion ones,” Finance
Director T.K. Ananth Kumar said in New Delhi today. “We think
the Chinese and South Koreans won’t be interested in these
smaller assets.”  India has lost out to China in at least $12.5 billion of
contracts in the year ended June 30. The Indian government asked
Oil India and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the country’s biggest
exploration company, to each make at least one acquisition this
financial year as energy demand grows in Asia’s second-fastest
growing major economy.  Oil India shares fell 0.6 percent to 1,410.05 rupees at
11:46 a.m. in Mumbai trading after gaining as much as 0.9
percent. The stock has climbed 14 percent this year, matching
the gain in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  The explorer had 110 billion rupees in cash as of Sept. 30,
Ananth Kumar said.  Oil India has hired seven banks including Citigroup Inc.
and Morgan Stanley to help advise on overseas acquisitions, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
