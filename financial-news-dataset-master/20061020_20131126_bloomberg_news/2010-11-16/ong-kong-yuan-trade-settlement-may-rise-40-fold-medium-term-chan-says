Yuan trade settlement in Hong Kong
may rise 40-fold in the “medium term” as China relaxes capital
controls, said  K. C. Chan , the city’s secretary for financial
services and the treasury.  Hong Kong is now seeing about 40 billion yuan ($6 billion)
of trade settled in the Chinese currency a year, Chan, accordin
to a  transcript  of remarks to a conference in London today
posted on the government’s Web site.  His projection for growth was based on a  HSBC Holdings Plc 
survey that estimates about 20 percent of trade between Hong
Kong and China will be settled in yuan and that Hong Kong
handles about 25 percent of Chinese exports.  China is encouraging greater use of its currency for
international trade and investment to reduce reliance on the
dollar as the Federal Reserve boosts money supply to support the
U.S. economy. HSBC has estimated about $2 trillion of annual
global trade may be settled in yuan in five years.  “Since the introduction of the cross-border renminbi trade
settlement scheme, we have seen a rapid growth in the renminbi
interbank market, renminbi deposits and the offer of renminbi-
denominated financial products in Hong Kong,” Chan told the
conference, using another word for the yuan.  Separately, 556 mainland Chinese companies have held
initial public offerings in Hong Kong, raising a total of $351
billion between 1993 and the end of September 2010, Chan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
