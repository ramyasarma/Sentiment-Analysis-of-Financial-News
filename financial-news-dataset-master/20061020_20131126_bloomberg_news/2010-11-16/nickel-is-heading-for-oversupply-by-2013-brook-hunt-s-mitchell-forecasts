The  nickel  market is heading for
oversupply by 2013 on current projections, prompting a decline
in prices, said research firm  Brook Hunt .  “We are apparently heading towards oversupply by 2013, but
it won’t be anywhere near as much as” expected because of the
potential for project delays,  Andrew Mitchell , an analyst at
Addlestone, England-based Brook Hunt, a Wood Mackenzie company,
told the New Caledonia Nickel Conference.  Nickel is the second-best performer of the six main
metals traded on the  London Metal Exchange  this year, driven by
rebounding demand from stainless steel makers. The market is
expected to return to a “small” supply surplus in 2011, UBS AG
said last month in a report.  Prices may drop to $6 a pound, or $13,224 a metric ton, to
$7 a pound by 2013, Mitchell said. Nickel futures on the London
Metal Exchange traded at $22,350 a ton at 11:18 a.m. Sydney time.  Projects using high pressure acid leaching technology
“account for half the projected increase in nickel supply and
that if they fail - or are an economic failure - the supply
demand outlook would be radically altered,” said  Alan Heap ,
managing director  of global commodity analysis at Citigroup
Inc., in a Nov. 8 report. The technology treats laterite ore,
which is harder to process than other nickel ores, using
sulfuric acid at high temperatures and pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
