The  Bovespa  stock index fell the
most in almost a month on speculation quickening inflation will
prompt policy makers to raise interest rates in nations from
Brazil to China.  Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron ore producer whose
biggest export market is China, slid after the Asian nation’s
state-run newspaper said price controls may be imposed to cool
the fastest inflation in two years.  Lojas Americanas SA  tumbled
4 percent, leading a drop for retailers, after a weekly central
bank survey showed economists expect rising rates next year.  “People are worried with inflation in China, and the world
is depending on China to keep driving global growth,” said  Roni Lacerda  who helps manage 2.8 billion reais ($1.61 billion) at
Rio de Janeiro-based hedge fund Mercatto Gestao de Recursos.
“Results in Brazil have been good, but the global sentiment is
overshadowing that.”  The Bovespa index sank 1.7 percent to 69,192.41 for its
fifth consecutive session of declines, the longest losing streak
since August. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  fell 1.3 percent
to 1,395.33. The real slipped 1.1 percent to 1.7416 per dollar.  Economists in the central bank survey said Brazil’s policy
makers will raise the Selic rate to 12 percent by the end of
next year, up from a week-earlier forecast of 11.75 percent.
Analysts raised their forecast for consumer-price increases to
5.48 percent this year and 5.05 percent in 2011. The bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus 2 percentage
points.  Inflow ‘Pressure’  Chinese Central Bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said the
country is under “pressure” from capital inflows. China,
Brazil’s biggest trading partner, raised borrowing costs last
month for the first time since 2007.  “While inflation still isn’t a major concern for the
Western world, it really is coming to the forefront in the
emerging markets,” said  Ivan Leung , Hong Kong-based chief
investment strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, which oversees
$600 billion in client assets.  Vale sank 1.8 percent to 48.25 reais. Lojas Americanas
dropped to 16.95 reais.  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA rose 0.3 percent to 26.57
reais. Latin America’s largest utility said third-quarter profit
surged 76 percent after the company had a smaller financial
expense tied to sales from its biggest hydropower dam.  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA, Brazil’s largest phone
company, known as Oi, dropped 3.5 percent to 24.55 reais. Oi is
preparing to purchase a stake in Portugal Telecom SGPS SA next
year, Diario Economico reported, citing unidentified people.  Through the end of last week, the Bovespa index had climbed
2.2 percent in 2010 after surging 83 percent last year, the most
since 2003. The measure traded for 10.7 times estimated profit,
compared with 11.4 times forecast earnings for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of developing nations’ stocks and 11.8 times for
MSCI’s gauge of Latin American shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
