Yahoo! Inc.  said it’s testing a
service that delivers coupons and discounts for local businesses
from partners including Groupon Inc. and LivingSocial.com.  The program, called Local Offers, will include deals from
about 20 providers, Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo said today
at an event in San Francisco. Yahoo is testing the service in
the U.S. and will share revenue with its partners.  “There are far too many offers and not enough people
seeing them,” Matt Idema, vice president of Yahoo! Local, said
at the event. “We can help put the right offer in front of the
right person.”  Chief Executive Officer  Carol Bartz  aims to keep users on
Yahoo pages longer and fend off a rising threat from social
networking sites such as Facebook Inc. Groupon has amassed more
than 20 million users and is raising venture capital that may
value it at more than $3 billion amid booming demand for daily
discounts sent via e-mail.  “We’ve put together a group of, we think, winners in
various niches of this deal-and-coupon space,” Bartz said at
the event.  Yahoo slipped 36 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.24 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The stock has
declined 3.2 percent this year.  The company didn’t elaborate on financial terms of Local
Offers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
