The pound traded near an eight-week
high versus the euro ahead of a report that may show U.K.
inflation exceeded the government’s 3 percent ceiling in
October.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg  forecast  consumer prices
rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the same pace as in
September. This would be the eighth month in a row that
inflation has exceeded the limit. Bank of England policy makers
voted on Nov. 4 to keep their so-called quantitative easing
program unchanged as the strength of the recovery persuaded them
to hold off buying more government bonds.  “If inflation does come out as expected, it will suggest
that there is no chance QE is going to happen in December,”
said  Jane Foley , a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “Although the market is of that view
already, it will just add to the buying interest in the pound.”  The pound slipped 0.2 percent against the euro to 84.79
pence at 8:18 a.m. in London, after yesterday strengthening to
84.53. It was little changed against the dollar at $1.6037.  U.K. government bonds were little changed, with the 10-year
yield at 3.28 percent and the two-year note yield at 1.09
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
