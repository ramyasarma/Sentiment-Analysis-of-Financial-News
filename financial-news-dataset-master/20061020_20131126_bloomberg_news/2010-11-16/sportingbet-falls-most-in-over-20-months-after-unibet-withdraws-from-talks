Sportingbet Plc  fell the most in
more than 20 months in London trading after the Internet betting
company said  Unibet Group Plc  has withdrawn from discussions of
a possible merger.  Sportingbet retreated as much as 9.2 percent in London, the
most since March 2009. “Unibet informed the company today that
it has withdrawn from” merger discussions, the London-based
company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.  The company said yesterday it “has had and will continue
to have discussions with different parties in relation to a
variety of potential opportunities.” The Sunday Times reported
on Nov. 14 that Sportingbet may merge with Malta-based Unibet
next year, citing someone it didn’t identify. The merger would
have created a 600 million-pound ($961 million) group, according
to the report.  Sportingbet fell as much as 5.8 pence to 57.5 pence and
traded at 57.85 pence as of 1:17 p.m., giving the company a
market value of 290.5 million pounds.  Unibet spokeswoman Inga Lundberg wasn’t immediately
available for comment when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
