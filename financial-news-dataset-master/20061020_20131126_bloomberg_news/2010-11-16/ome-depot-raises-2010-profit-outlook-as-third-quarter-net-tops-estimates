Home Depot Inc. , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, posted a 21 percent gain in third-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and increased its
earnings forecast for the year after curbing expenses.  Net income increased to $834 million, or 51 cents a share,
in the quarter ended Oct. 31 from $689 million, or 41 cents, a
year earlier, Atlanta-based Home Depot said today in a
statement. Analysts projected 48 cents, the average of 22
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Home Depot, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Frank Blake , improved its gross profit margin after eliminating
1,000 U.S. jobs in the first quarter. Merchandise inventories
increased 1.6 percent, while revenue rose 1.4 percent to $16.6
billion, matching the average estimate.  “They are operating more efficiently and doing a good job
managing inventories, which is reducing markdowns,”  Brian Sozzi , an analyst at Wall Street Strategies Inc. in New York,
said today. He recommends buying Home Depot shares.  The retailer raised its full-year profit forecast to $1.94
a share, from a previous projection of $1.90 a share. Sales for
the year will gain about 2.2 percent, Home Depot also said, down
from an August forecast for growth of about 2.6 percent.  Home Depot rose 32 cents to $31.71 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 9.6
percent this year.  Gross Profit Margin  The  gross profit margin  widened to 34.3 percent from 34
percent a year earlier. Selling, general and administrative
expenses declined 0.9 percent to $3.84 billion, muting a drop in
the value of the average transaction in the quarter.  The average sales ticket was $51.47, 42 cents lower than a
year earlier, as homeowners curbed major expenses such as
kitchen remodeling. The number of customer transactions rose 2.5
percent to 322 million.  Lowe’s Cos. , the second-largest home-improvement retailer,
yesterday reported third-quarter profit that increased 17
percent as it controlled labor expenses to counter slower-than-
forecast sales growth. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based
retailer also cut its full-year profit forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
