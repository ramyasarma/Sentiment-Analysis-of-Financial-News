Refining profits in northwest Europe
fell from a two-year high after strikes ended in France,
boosting production of fuels such as gasoline and diesel, data
from  BP Plc  show.  BP’s estimate, a broad measure of refining profitability,
averaged $4.64 a barrel this quarter to Nov. 11, according to
data on the London-based company’s  website . That compares with
$5.16 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 21, the highest level since the fourth
quarter of 2008. Margins for Mediterranean refiners fell to
$3.72 a barrel from $4.22 in the same period, the data show.  A 33-day strike at ports in France that ended on Oct. 29
left dozens of vessels unable to dock and forced refineries to
cut output, boosting margins. Protests over the government’s
pension reform plans caused the rest of the country’s plants to
cease operating from Oct. 12. All plants resumed operations in
early November.  BP’s Global Indicator Margin, which includes the U.S. and
Asia, averaged $4.41 a barrel in the quarter to Nov. 11 compared
with $4.53 in the third quarter, according to the data.  Refiners in the U.S. Midwest region theoretically earned on
average $5.27 a barrel, down from $6.34 in the previous quarter,
the data shows. Plants on the U.S. West Coast made $4.98 a
barrel, a 31 percent fall from the third quarter, and Gulf Coast
refiners had profits drop by 65 cents to $4.07 a barrel.  Refiners in Asia made the least from processing crude into
fuels, with a profit of $2.35 a barrel, 1 cent more than the
previous quarter, , according to the data.  BP’s Global Indicator Margin is a generic number derived
from third-party data, using typical regional crude oils and
product yields, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
