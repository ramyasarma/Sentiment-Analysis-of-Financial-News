Corn tumbled to a five-week low in
Chicago and soybeans dropped 5.2 percent on concern that China
will curb commodity speculation and limit inflation, reducing
demand for imported crops.  Premier Wen Jiabao said today that the cabinet is drafting
measures to counter the fastest inflation in two years. China
may impose price limits on food and toughen punishment for those
found speculating on agriculture futures, the China Securities
Journal said, citing an unidentified person. The country, the
world’s top oilseed buyer, has boosted corn imports this year.  “Fears of China cracking down on inflation, without giving
any specifics, will keep pressure on the markets,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa. “People are getting to the point in the year
where they may be willing to liquidate commodity long positions
and wait and see what happens in China.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 29 cents, or 5.1
percent, to close at $5.40 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price declined by the exchange
limit of 30 cents to $5.39, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 8.  On Nov. 9, corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after
adverse weather reduced the size of the U.S. crop.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 66.75 cents to
$12.1975 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed fell by the exchange
limit of 70 cents to $12.165, the lowest since Oct. 27. The
commodity plunged 5.2 percent on Nov. 12 after reaching $13.485,
the highest price since Aug. 28, 2008.  2008 Price Freeze  In January 2008, China temporarily froze prices for oil
products, natural gas and electricity to counter inflation that
surged by the fastest pace in more than a decade.  Corn and soybeans also fell on forecasts for rain in the
next two weeks in Argentina and Brazil, the biggest exporters
behind the U.S., Roose said.  Fields in parts of both countries will get as much as 4
inches (10.1 centimeters), boosting development of newly planted
crops,  Allen Motew , a meteorologist at QT Weather in Chicago,
said in a report.  “The South American forecasts are wetter, and that will
drive prices lower,” Roose of U.S. Commodities said. “The
markets will need to find out if demand rebounds at the lower
prices.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
