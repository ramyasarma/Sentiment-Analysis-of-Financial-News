Solar Millennium AG , the German
maker of parabolic solar-power equipment, moved closer to
starting construction on power plants in Nevada and California
after U.S. authorities gave the projects a green light.  U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar signed a right-of-way
grant for Solar Millennium’s planned plant in Nevada’s Amargosa
Valley and a committee of the California Energy Commission
recommended granting approval for two solar-thermal generators,
the company said in a statement on the Frankfurt exchange
newswire.  Solar Millennium develops and produces parabolic-shaped
collectors that concentrate sunlight using arrays of mirrors to
make steam and turn electric turbines. The U.S. southwest and
Spain, with some of the world’s highest solar radiation levels,
are attracting the most investment in the technology, which is
also called concentrated solar power.  The Nevada and California projects would have a combined
capacity to produce 1,000 megawatts of electricity, about
equivalent to one nuclear plant.  California regulators in July approved Southern California
Edison Co.’s contract to buy two 242-megawatt facilities that
will use parabolic-trough technology from Solar Millennium. The
project, known as CA Solar 10, will be built near Blythe by
Solar Trust of America LLC, a joint venture between Solar
Millennium and German contractor Man Ferrostaal AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
