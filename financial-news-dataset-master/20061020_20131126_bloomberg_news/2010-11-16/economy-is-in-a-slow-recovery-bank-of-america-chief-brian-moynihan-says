The U.S. economy is in a slow
rebound as consumer spending and commercial lending improve,
 Bank of America Corp . Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan
said today.  “Everything we see points to a continued recovery, albeit
a slow recovery,” Moynihan said during a conference held by the
lender in New York. “We continue to see delinquencies improve
in all our products across the board.” Commercial lending is
starting to turn around and consumers are spending more on
leisure, he said.  Bank of America, which gets more than  three-quarters  of its
revenue from the U.S., is a “mirror” to the domestic
economy, Moynihan said this month. Employers added 151,000
workers to payrolls in October, the first increase since May,
according to the Labor Department. The average number of
Americans filing  claims  for jobless benefits dropped to a two-
year low, the agency said.  Bank of America earmarked $5.6 billion for credit losses in
the third quarter, compared with $8.1 billion in the second
quarter and $11.7 billion a year earlier. Net write-offs of
uncollectible loans at the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender declined 25 percent.  The bank has posted three unprofitable quarters since the
beginning of 2009 as new regulations pressure fee income and
unemployment holds near 10 percent, limiting customers’ ability
to repay debts. The firm reported a $7.3 billion third-quarter
 loss  tied to new rules on credit cards and consumer accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
