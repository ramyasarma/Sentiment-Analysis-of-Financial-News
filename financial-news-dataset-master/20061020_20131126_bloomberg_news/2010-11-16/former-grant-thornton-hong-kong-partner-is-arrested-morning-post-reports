A former managing partner at
accountancy firm Grant Thornton Hong Kong was arrested in Spain
after Hong Kong police alerted Interpol they were seeking him on
fraud allegations, the South China Morning Post reported.  Gabriel Ricardo Dias-Azedo was detained last month in the
city of Salamanca, the English-language daily said, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Dias-Azedo left Hong Kong in September last year and is
alleged by creditors to have misappropriated HK$91 million, the
Morning Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
