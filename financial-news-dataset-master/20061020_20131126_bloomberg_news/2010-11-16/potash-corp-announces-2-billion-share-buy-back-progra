Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. 
announced plans to repurchase as much as $2 billion of its
stock, a day after  BHP Billiton Ltd. , which failed in a bid to
buy the fertilizer company, resumed its own buyback.  Potash Corp. may repurchase 14.6 million traded shares, or
about 4.9 percent of its stock, at market prices, it said
yesterday in a statement. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
company, which has a year to complete the plan, said it intends
to buy back the stock by Dec. 31.  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, abandoned its $40
billion hostile bid for Potash Corp. this week following
Canadian government opposition. Melbourne-based BHP subsequently
revived a $13 billion buyback plan that was suspended in 2007,
saying it will spend the remaining $4.2 billion component.  Potash Corp.  advanced $1.44, or 1.1 percent, to $136.07 as
of 4::15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  BHP 
rose 0.8 percent to 2,335.5 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in
London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
