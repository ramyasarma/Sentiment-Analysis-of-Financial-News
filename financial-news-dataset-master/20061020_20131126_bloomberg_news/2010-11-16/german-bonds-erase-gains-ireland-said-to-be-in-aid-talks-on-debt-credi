German government bonds erased their
advance after a European official said Ireland is in talks with
European and International Monetary Fund officials about a
bailout that would shore up the state’s finances as well as
enable it to inject capital into the country’s banks.  German 10-year yields were one basis point higher at 2.58
percent as of 1:26 p.m. in London after falling to 2.5 percent
earlier.  The two-part funding package would mean Ireland wouldn’t
have to tap the bond market for an extended period as it tries
to cut the budget deficit, said the person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. It would also give the government
capital to help banks if necessary. Ireland says it’s fully
funded into mid-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
