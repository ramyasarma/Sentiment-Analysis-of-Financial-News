BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s most likely
acquisition targets are Australia’s Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and
U.S.-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Credit Suisse said.  BHP, Australia’s largest oil and gas producer, is expected
to make the petroleum industry a top priority for mergers and
acquisitions, Credit Suisse analysts, including Sydney-based
 Paul McTaggart , wrote in a report today.  “We believe a  Woodside  acquisition would be simple,
relatively straightforward and potentially involve less risk,”
the analysts wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
