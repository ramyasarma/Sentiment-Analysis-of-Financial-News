Japan’s benchmark  bonds  fell,
pushing yields toward a two-month high, as the yen’s drop
to near the weakest in six weeks improved the earnings outlook
for the nation’s exporters.  Bond futures declined after posting the biggest intraday
price swing since September yesterday. Bonds also slumped as the
difference between dividend yields on Japanese stocks and 10-
year bond yields was near the highest level in 20 months.  “Some investors are selling 10-year bonds to shorten the
maturity of their portfolios,” said  Susumu Kato , chief
economist for Japan in Tokyo at Credit Agricole CIB and CLSA, a
unit of France’s largest bank by branches. “People are cautious
because the yen has edged toward a weakening trend.”  The  yield  on the 10-year bond climbed three basis points to
1.055 percent as of 3:17 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1 percent
security due in September 2020 fell 0.266 yen to 99.51 yen. The
yield rose to 1.09 percent yesterday, the most since Sept. 15.  Ten-year futures for December delivery lost 0.43 to 141.96
at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yen depreciated to 83.59 per dollar yesterday, the
least since Oct. 5, before trading at 83.44 today. The
currency’s drop bolstered domestic shares, helping the the Topix
index increase 0.3 percent.  The difference between dividend yields on Topix-listed
stocks and 10-year bond yields stood at 1.05 percent. It rose to
1.29 percent on Nov. 2, a level not seen since March 2009.  Higher Volatility  Bond futures slid as much as 0.51 yesterday before
reversing losses to gain 0.37, the biggest price swing since
Aug. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Implied
volatility on options for the contracts increased to 3.667
percent yesterday, the highest since Sept. 13.  “The slump today is in part a reaction to the unexpected
run-up in debt yesterday,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rates
strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. JPMorgan is one of
the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.  Implied volatility, a gauge of traders’ expectation for
future price swings, gains as demand for options increases.  Japan’s Ministry of Finance will auction 1.1 trillion yen
($13.2 billion) in 20-year debt tomorrow. Yields on 20-year
bonds have gained more than 16 basis points in the past month.  “We expect the auction to be absorbed smoothly, or at
least without difficulty, primarily on steady buying from
domestic absolute-yield buyers,”  RuiXue Xu  and  Beomjoon Ryu ,
strategists RBS Securities in Tokyo, wrote in a report today.
RBS Securities, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, is another
primary dealer with the government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
