The proposed Nabucco and South
Stream pipeline projects to bring natural gas to Europe are
among topics being discussed by Italy and Germany at a bilateral
level, German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  said today.  “The opening up of the energy market” and
“diversification of energy sources with projects like Nabucco
and South Stream” are among issues the two counties are
discussing, Bruederle told reporters in Rome today. He was in
the country to meet with his Italian counterparts.  Italy’s  Eni SpA  and Russia’s  OAO Gazprom  are jointly
heading the South Stream project that links Southeastern Europe
to Russia via the Black Sea. Germany’s  RWE AG  said July 13 it
was examining a Russian offer to join South Stream.  RWE is currently a stakeholder in South Stream rival
project Nabucco, which is designed to diversify energy sources
for Europe by opening up the so-called southern corridor,
bringing gas from the Caspian Sea region and Middle East to
Austria through Turkey, thus reducing dependence on Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
