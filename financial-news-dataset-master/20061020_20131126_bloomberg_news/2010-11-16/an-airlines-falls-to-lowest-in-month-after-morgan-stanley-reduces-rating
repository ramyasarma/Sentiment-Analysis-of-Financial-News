Lan Airlines SA , Latin America’s
largest airline by market value, fell to its lowest intraday
price in almost four weeks after  Morgan Stanley  reduced its
recommendation on the stock, citing limited potential upside.  Lan declined 1.2 percent to 14,625 pesos at 9:34 a.m. New
York time, its lowest price since Oct. 22. The  IPSA index 
retreated 1 percent to 4,904.48.  Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation to “equalweight”
from “overweight.” The bank eliminated its 12-month price
target for the American depositary receipts.  Lan Airlines will continue to show strong growth figures,
as the cargo business has room to expand and passenger traffic
is driven by “strong” economic growth, Morgan Stanley analysts
 Nicolai Sebrell  and  Augusto Ensiki  wrote in a note e-mailed
yesterday to clients after the market closed.  “The growth is already priced in the stock, as Lan is the
most expensive airline among the global peers we track,” they
said.  Morgan Stanley also cited concerns regarding the merger
with Brazil’s  Tam SA  as a reason for the downgrade.  “Cross-border mergers between entities with different
cultures, regulators, systems and business practices are likely
to present unforeseen challenges,” the analysts said.  Lan agreed in August to acquire Tam in a $3.7 billion deal
that will result in the creation of a merged company called
Latam Airlines. Lan also agreed in October to buy Colombia’s
Aerovias de Integracion Regional SA for $32.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
