Poland’s central bank shouldn’t
increase interest rates this month, Andrzej Bratkowski, a member
of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Council, said in an
interview with TVN CNBC television yesterday. The bank still has
time to consider an increase and should take time to observe the
movements of the zloty currency, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
