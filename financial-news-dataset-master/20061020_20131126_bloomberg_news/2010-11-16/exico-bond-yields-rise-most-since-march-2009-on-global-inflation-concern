Mexico’s peso bond yields rose the
most since August as concern grows the Federal Reserve’s plan to
purchase $600 billion in bonds to shore up the world’s largest
economy may lead to a pickup in global inflation.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose 18
basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.785 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA. Yields have
risen for seven straight days and today gained the most since
Aug. 26. The bond’s price fell 1.95 centavos to 129.06 centavos
per peso.  “The market is taking into a4ccount greater inflation than
the Fed may be willing to deal with in the future,” said  Rafael Camarena,  an economist with Banco Santander SA in Mexico City.  The Fed’s plan to buy $600 billion in securities risks
“currency debasement and inflation,” former Republican
government officials and economists wrote in a letter to be
published this week in the Wall Street Journal and The New York
Times.  The peso fell 0.9 percent to 12.4176 per dollar, from
12.3067 yesterday, a holiday in Mexico. Earlier, the currency
dropped as much as 1.5 percent, the most since Aug. 11. The
decline pared the peso’s gain this year against the dollar to
5.4 percent.  The dollar rose against 14 of the 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, as Ireland was said to be in talks with
European and International Monetary Fund officials about a
bailout to shore up state finances, fueling speculation other
nations may follow. The dollar gained 0.7 percent to $1.3489 per
euro. Only the South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar gained on
the U.S. dollar.  Risk Aversion  “It’s a risk-aversion day, and Mexico is playing catch
up,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income
research at IDEAglobal in New York. “The noise on sovereign
debt in Europe has been much bigger in the last few days. The
key is in Europe, and how quickly this spreads to other
nations.”  Traders didn’t trigger any of the $600 million in available
dollar options today, the central bank said on its website. The
bank has been auctioning the dollar options monthly, allowing it
to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign reserves after the
peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
