Latin American governments should
press China to allow the yuan to rise to ensure their economies
remain competitive as inflows cause their currencies to
strengthen, a panel of former senior economic officials said.  Coordinated currency policies in Latin America and China
would help all countries, the  Latin American Shadow Financial
Regulatory Committee  said in a statement issued today in Lima.  “This reflects the growing importance the Chinese economy
is having with respect to international trade flows in the
region,” the committee said.     The group’s chair is  Liliana Rojas-Suarez , a former chief Latin America economist for
Deutsche Bank AG; other members are  Guillermo Calvo , former
chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank; and
former Colombian Finance Minister  Alberto Carrasquilla .  Latin American central banks should also consider buying
foreign currency to reduce domestic money supply and prevent
sharp movements in their local currencies, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
