An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks sank, dragging the Dow Jones
Industrial Average below 11,000 for the first time in a month,
amid mounting concern China will raise interest rates to curb
inflation and Ireland will need to tap international bailout
funds.
*Chevron Corp. and Alcoa Inc. declined at least 2 percent as oil
and metals prices slumped. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s
largest retailer, climbed 1.1 percent after reporting an
increase in third-quarter profit.
*The S&P 500 slid 1.8 percent to 1,176.31 at 12:45 p.m. in
New York. The drop was the biggest loss on a closing basis in
three months and follows a late-day selloff yesterday triggered
by growing criticism of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative
easing program and concern that the extension of tax cuts may
lead to higher borrowing costs.
*The Dow fell 206.96 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,995.01.  London: European stocks tumbled by the most in four months amid
concern that China will have to take measures to cool inflation
and as Ireland held talks over a financial rescue amid the
resurgent debt crisis.
*Rio Tinto Group paced declines by mining stocks, losing 4.8
percent as metals prices plunged. HSBC Holdings Plc and BNP
Paribas SA slipped more than 2 percent.
*The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 2.3 percent to
265.98 at the close in London, the biggest one-day drop since
July 1. The gauge fell 0.7 percent last week as mounting concern
about the cost of bailing out Ireland’s banks led to a surge in
the cost of insuring bonds from Europe’s most indebted nations.  Tokyo: Asian stocks fell for a third day on speculation that
governments in the region will take further steps to cool
inflation. Japanese exporters rose after a report showed U.S.
retail sales grew more than estimated and the yen weakened
against the dollar.
*Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.3 percent.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3
percent to 4,700.30 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.4 percent to 3,315.06 at
the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar rose to a seven-week high against the euro
as European finance ministers met in Brussels, debt-strapped
Ireland’s leader said the nation hasn’t asked for external aid
and concern mounted over Greece’s economic health.
*The shared currency weakened versus the yen and dollar as Irish
bonds fell, reversing a two-day rally, on concern finance
ministers might fail to strike a deal on support for Ireland.
*The dollar appreciated 0.8 percent to $1.3483 per euro at 1:01
p.m. in New York, from $1.3587 yesterday, after earlier falling
as much as 0.5 percent. It touched $1.3459, the strongest level
since Sept. 28.
*The greenback rose 0.5 percent to 83.46 yen, from 83.07 yen
yesterday. It touched 83.56 yen, the highest level since Oct. 5.
*The euro fell 0.3 percent to 112.54 yen, from 112.88.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries rose, recovering from the biggest two-day
decline in almost two years, as Federal Reserve officials
reinforced support for the $600 billion asset purchase program.
*Benchmark 10-year yields jumped 31 basis points during the
previous two trading days, the most since a back-to-back surge
of 33 basis points in January 2009.
*Yields on 10-year notes fell five basis points to 2.91 percent
as of 1:45 p.m. in New York.
*Thirty-year notes yields fell nine basis points to 4.32 percent
and two-year note yields declined two basis points to 0.52
percent.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper fell to the lowest price in almost two weeks on
concern that demand will wane in China, the world’s biggest
metals user.
*Global stocks slumped and the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled
to a one-month low amid speculation that China will take steps
to rein in inflation and curb growth. Copper has rallied
fivefold since 2002 as growth in emerging markets boosted demand
for the metal used in buildings and electric grids.
*Copper futures for March delivery dropped 11.35 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $3.811 a pound at 10:18 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $3.8005, the lowest level for a
most-active contract since Nov. 3.  GOLD  New York: Gold fell to the lowest price in almost two weeks as
the dollar rallied, eroding the appeal of the precious metal as
an alternative asset.
*The dollar rose for a second straight day, rising as much as
0.6 percent against a basket of six major currencies. Before
today, gold gained 25 percent this year, touching a record
$1,424.30 an ounce last month on speculation that the Federal
Reserve’s program to buy back bonds to bolster the economy would
erode the U.S. currency.
*Gold futures for December delivery fell $27, or 2 percent, to
$1,341.50 an ounce at 11:02 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching $1,339.30, the lowest price for a most-active contract
since Nov. 3.  OIL  New York: Crude oil tumbled to a two-week low on speculation
Europe’s deepening debt crisis and steps to cool Asia’s economic
growth will reduce commodity demand.
*Oil slid as much as 3.1 percent as European ministers gathered
in Brussels to discuss aid to Ireland’s banks. The Bank of Korea
raised interest rates for the second time this year and the
China Securities Journal said the Chinese government will take
steps to control rising prices. The drop accelerated after U.S.
wholesale costs rose less than forecast in October.
*Crude oil for December delivery fell $2.27, or 2.7 percent, to
$82.59 a barrel at 1:48 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Futures touched $82.26, the lowest level since Nov. 1.  WHAT TO WATCH
