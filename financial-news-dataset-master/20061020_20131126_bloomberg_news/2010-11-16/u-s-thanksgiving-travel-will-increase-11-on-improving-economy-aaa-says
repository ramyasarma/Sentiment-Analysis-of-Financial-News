U.S. travel during the Thanksgiving
holiday weekend will rise 11 percent from last year on improved
economic conditions, AAA said today.  About 42.2 million people will journey 50 miles or more
from home this year, up from 37.9 million last year, AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring organization, said in a statement.  “While Americans remain cautious with household budgets
and discretionary spending amidst high levels of unemployment,
many are in a better financial position this Thanksgiving than a
year ago,” AAA President and CEO  Robert Darbelnet , said in a
statement.  Automobile transportation will account for 39.7 million of
the holiday travelers, a 12 percent increase from last year. The
number of air passengers will rise 3.5 percent to 1.62 million,
according to the report.  The average price of a gallon of self-serve gasoline will
be between $2.85 and $2.95 a gallon over the holiday period,
according to AAA. Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged
nationwide, is $2.893 a gallon, 10 percent higher than a year
ago, AAA said today on its  website .  Americans will spend approximately $495 per household to
travel during the holiday period, which runs from Nov. 24
through Nov. 28, with a round-trip average of 816 miles, AAA
said. The Thanksgiving holiday falls on Nov. 25 this year.  AAA’s projections are based on research by IHS Global
Insight of Lexington, Massachusetts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
