Deutsche Bank AG’s head of
investment banking, Anshu Jain, said he doesn’t think Ireland,
Portugal or Greece will default in the near future because
European regulators are aware of the consequences.  “It is unlikely that any of these countries will default
on their payment obligations in the near future,” Jain said at
a conference in Frankfurt today. “The consequences of default
are significant and well enough known to all the regulators so
we’re counting on sensible resolution mechanisms short of
default.”  Speculation about Ireland requiring aid from the European
Union has reignited concerns about a resurgent debt crisis. The
Irish turmoil marks a new stage in a sovereign debt crisis that
was triggered by Greece and threatened to break the euro region
apart in May. Irish bonds jumped yesterday as traders bet on a
rescue at today’s Brussels meeting.  The global market outlook in 2011 “will be driven by the
continuing aftershocks of the financial crisis,” Jain said in
his speech. He expects a challenging refinancing environment in
sovereign debt markets of the peripheral economies in the euro
zone, “anemic” growth in mature economies and a shift of power
to emerging nations such as China, he said.  Global equity markets including Germany’s benchmark DAX
will maintain gains and should increase another 10 percent to 20
percent next year, Jain said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
