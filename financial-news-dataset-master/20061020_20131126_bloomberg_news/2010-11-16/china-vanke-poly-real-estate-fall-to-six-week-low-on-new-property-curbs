China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate
Group Co., the nation’s biggest developers, fell to the lowest
in more than six weeks in Shanghai after the government
tightened restrictions on foreign homebuyers.  China Vanke dropped 3.8 percent to 8.21 yuan as of 10:20
a.m. local time. Poly fell 4.2 percent to 12.41 yuan.  Foreigners will have to provide home ownership statements
before their purchases, along with proof of at least a year’s
employment in China, the State Administration of Foreign
exchange and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural
Development said. Overseas companies are only allowed to buy
offices in cities where they are registered, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
