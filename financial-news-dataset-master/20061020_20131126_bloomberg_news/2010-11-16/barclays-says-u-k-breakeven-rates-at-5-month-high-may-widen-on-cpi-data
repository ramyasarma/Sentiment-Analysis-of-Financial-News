U.K. breakeven rates, which provide
a gauge of inflation expectations, may rise should a report
today show consumer price increases outpaced analysts’
estimates, according to Barclays Plc.  The 10-year  breakeven rate , derived from the difference in
yield between nominal and index-linked bonds, closed at more
than 3 percentage points yesterday for the first time since June
4. A report from the Office for National Statistics today may
show consumer prices rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the
same pace as in September, the median forecast of 28 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Breakevens “may have room to widen further on any upside
surprise,” a team of Barclays analysts including  Alan James ,
 Khrishnamoorthy Sooben  and Henry Skeoch  in London wrote in an
investor report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
