Poland will sell three-year and
five-year Samurai bonds this month to cap its biggest year for
international debt offerings since 2005.  The government filed with Japan’s finance ministry today
and started marketing its first sale of yen-denominated bonds in
a year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
transaction. Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. are
helping Poland sell the bonds, said the person.  The ministry told investors it plans to price three-year
bonds to yield between 70 basis points to 90 basis points more
than yen swaps, said the person, asking not to be identified as
the information is private. Poland is seeking to price five-year
bonds at a spread of between 85 basis points and 105 basis
points.  Poland may sell about $500 million worth of the yen-
denominated bonds,  Piotr Marczak , the head of the Finance
Ministry’s public debt department, said on Oct. 29.  The country has raised the equivalent of $9.44 billion from
the sale of bonds in euros, dollars and Swiss francs this year
as higher lending rates than in developed markets and one of the
European Union’s fastest economic growth rates lured investors.
The government sold $11.9 billion in foreign currency bonds in
2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Poland last sold Samurai bonds in November 2009, when it
raised 44.8 billion yen ($539 million), including 23.3 billion
yen of 1.92 percent, three-year bonds priced to yield 120 basis
points more than the yen swap rate, and 21.5 billion yen of 2.34
percent, five-year notes with a 140 basis point-spread,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
