Finance Minister  Yuval Steinitz  said
the U.S. has yet to present Israel with a written draft of its
plan to renew Mideast peace talks, which calls for a new 90-day
settlement construction freeze in the West Bank.  “We still do not have a final proposal in writing that can
be discussed in depth,” Steinitz said in an interview today on
Israel Army Radio.  The U.S. has proposed that Israel freeze building in West
Bank settlements in exchange for 20 warplanes, a pledge not to
demand any further construction moratoriums, and a promise to
veto in the United Nations any proposal that would try to impose
a peace agreement, according to diplomats familiar with the
deal.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  presented the
plan to his Cabinet on Nov. 14 and said a final proposal was
still being put together by Israeli and U.S. negotiators.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said yesterday that
Israel’s consideration of a settlement freeze was a “promising
development.” She said she will be working daily to restart
stalled Middle East peace talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
