Former Arsenal forward Robert Pires
will join Aston Villa in England’s Premier League later this
week, the Midlands club said on its website.  The 37-year-old Frenchman, who’s been training with
Arsenal, is a free agent after leaving Spain’s Villarreal. Aston
Villa didn’t immediately give contract details.  Pires helped Arsenal win two Premier League titles and
three F.A. Cups and took the soccer writers’ 2002 Footballer of
the Year award during a six-year stint with the north London
team. He left for Villarreal in 2006.  Earlier in his career Pires played for Metz and Marseille,
and was in the French squads for the World Cup and European
Championship wins in 1998 and 2000, respectively.  Villa needs midfielders because of injuries to players
including Nigel Reo-Coker and Steve Sidwell.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
