The U.S. Federal Reserve isn’t
trying to weaken the dollar or push inflation higher than 2
percent with its bond-buying program, Janet Yellen, the Fed’s
new vice chairman, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview.  The program, known as quantitative easing, is justified
because of low inflation and a 9.6 percent rate of unemployment,
Yellen told the Journal. It shouldn’t be considered as “some
sort of chapter in a currency war," she said. The interview was
conducted last week, according to the Journal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
