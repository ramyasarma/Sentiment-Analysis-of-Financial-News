The pound may reverse losses against
the euro and dollar as investors bet that inflation above the
government’s upper limit will prevent the Bank of England from
expanding asset purchases, according to Forex.com.  “The stronger inflation reading makes more quantitative
easing less likely in the near term, which is pound positive,”
 Kathleen Brooks , research director in London at Forex.com, part
of online currency trading firm Gain Capital, wrote in a client
note today. “For as long as quantitative easing is off the
table, we believe sterling should perform well against the euro
and also hold up fairly well against the dollar.”  Sterling lost 0.4 percent to $1.5991 as of 11:18 a.m. in
London and was 0.3 percent weaker at 84.93 pence.  U.K. consumer prices increased 3.2 percent in October from
a year earlier, exceeding the median forecast of 3.1 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey, government data showed today. That
prompted Bank of England Governor Mervyn King to write to
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne explaining why
inflation is breaching the 3 percent limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
