New Zealand will seek to manage a
kiwifruit vine disease identified in the Bay of Plenty region of
the nation’s North island, rather than attempt eradication,
according to Zespri, the largest seller of the fruit.  The Kiwifruit Advisory Council and the Biosecurity Minister
have agreed that the only prudent approach is to take an
aggressive strategy to managing the disease, Zespri said in an
e-mailed statement. Thirteen orchards have returned positive
results for the disease, unchanged from late yesterday, the
company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
