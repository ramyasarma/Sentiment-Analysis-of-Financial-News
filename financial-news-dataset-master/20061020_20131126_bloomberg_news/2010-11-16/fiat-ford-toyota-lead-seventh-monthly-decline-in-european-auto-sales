Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz division
failed to keep pace with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s namesake
brand and  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi as the automaker dropped to third
in European luxury-car deliveries last month.  Mercedes-Benz’s sales in Europe fell 2.5 percent to 50,855
cars and sport-utility vehicles in October, while Audi’s gained
2.2 percent to 52,181 and BMW’s rose 6.2 percent to 51,863, the
Brussels-based  European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association 
said today. Mercedes-Benz sold 489,718 vehicles in the 10 months
through October, fewer than the 503,771 sold by BMW. Audi was
the region’s largest high-end carmaker with 524,549 deliveries.  BMW, the biggest manufacturer of luxury vehicles worldwide,
is profiting from a revamped 5-Series sedan and a new compact
SUV, the X1. Audi is attracting buyers with the new A1
subcompact. Mercedes-Benz’s volumes have slipped as its A- and
B-Class compacts near the end of their lifecycles. All three
companies gained market share in Europe, where demand is waning
as governments end or reduce subsidies aimed at encouraging
trade-ins of decade-old vehicles for scrapping.  “Mercedes may be taking a double hit because the A- and B-
Class were helped last year by scrapping incentives and a model
changeover is set for late next year,” said Marc-Rene Tonn, an
analyst with M.M. Warburg in Hamburg. Still, “there’s no reason
to be concerned about Mercedes’s European business.”  Shares Decline  Daimler  dropped  as much as 81 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
50.08 euros and was down 1.3 percent as of 1:11 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading. BMW  fell  1.1 percent to 55.46 euros.
Preferred stock in Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker,
 declined  0.3 percent to 116.20 euros. Fiat SpA, Italy’s biggest
automaker,  rose  0.5 percent to 13.43 euros in Milan trading.  European auto registrations fell 16 percent to 1.06 million
vehicles in October, the seventh consecutive monthly drop, with
10-month sales declining 5 percent, according to the
association’s figures.  The region’s five biggest car markets of  Germany , Italy,
France, Spain and the U.K. all contracted by more than 18
percent in October, with sales in Spain slumping 38 percent, the
steepest drop.  Fiat ,  Ford Motor Co.  and  Toyota Motor Corp. 
posted the sharpest declines among manufacturers.  The drop “continues to show the difficulties faced by the
car industry in the region,” after so-called scrappage programs
“heavily boosted” sales a year ago,  Jonathon Poskitt , an
Oxford, England-based analyst with J.D. Power & Associates, said
before the release. “The underlying weakness of the market is
being revealed” as the subsidies end.  Sales by Turin-based Fiat tumbled 33 percent to 73,774
vehicles. Ford’s European registrations dropped 29 percent to
77,093, while Toyota’s fell 28 percent to 46,500 autos.
Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen  recorded a drop of
11 percent to 239,526 cars and SUVs, with the decline held back
by Audi’s growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
