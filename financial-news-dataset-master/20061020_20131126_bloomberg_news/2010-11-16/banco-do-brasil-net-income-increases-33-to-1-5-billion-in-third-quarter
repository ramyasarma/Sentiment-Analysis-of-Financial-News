Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s
biggest bank by assets, said third-quarter  net income  rose 33
percent as lending increased.  Profit climbed to 2.63 billion reais ($1.52 billion) from
1.98 billion reais a year earlier. Profit excluding
extraordinary events increased 46 percent to 2.58 billion reais, 
the Brasilia-based lender said today in a regulatory filing.
The mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for 2.31 billion reais in adjusted net income.  Brazilian  bank lending  expanded in September at the fastest
pace since June as record low unemployment and salary increases
fueled demand for consumer and corporate credit. Outstanding
credit in Latin American’s largest economy increased almost 20
percent in September to a record 1.61 trillion reais.  Banco do Brasil ’s loan portfolio increased 19 percent
to 339.8 billion reais. The average default rate, defined as a
delay in payment of more than 90 days, declined to 2.7 percent
in September from 3.6 percent in the same month a year earlier.
Banco do Brasil’s total assets increased 16 percent to 796.8
billion reais.  The lender’s  shares  increased 14 percent this year through
yesterday, outperforming the 2.6 percent gain of the Bovespa
benchmark stock index.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s biggest bank by market
value, said on Nov. 3 its adjusted net income climbed 18 percent
to 3.2 billion reais. Shares of the company are up 8.6 percent
this year.  Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, said on Oct. 27 its adjusted net income increased 40
percent to 2.52 billion reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
