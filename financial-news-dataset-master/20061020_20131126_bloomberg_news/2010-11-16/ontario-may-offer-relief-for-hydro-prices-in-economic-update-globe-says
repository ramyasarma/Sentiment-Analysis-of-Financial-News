Ontario’s governing Liberal Party
may provide relief to residents of Canada’s most populous
province from rising electricity prices, the Globe and Mail
reported, citing unidentified people.  Ontario Finance Minister  Dwight Duncan  may announce changes
on Nov. 18 during the government’s economic statement, the
 newspaper  said. The measures would mark a policy shift for
Ontario Premier  Dalton McGuinty , who has said that higher
electricity prices are necessary, the Globe reported.  An across-the-board rate freeze is unlikely, the
unidentified people told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
