Zimbabwe’s inflation slowed to 3.6
percent in October from 4.2 percent in September, said  Moffat Nyoni , head of the country’s statistics agency.  The costs of medicines, rent, utilities and alcoholic
beverages have fallen over the last 12 months, helping to reduce
the inflation rate, Nyoni said in a telephone interview today
from Harare, the capital.  Month-on-month inflation increased to 0.2 percent from 0.1
percent because of a stronger rand in neighboring South Africa,
the main source of Zimbabwean imports, Nyoni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
