Chelsea defender Alex will miss six
to eight weeks because he needs to undergo knee surgery, the
English Premier League soccer club said.  The Brazilian will not play in his national side’s game
this week against Argentina, after missing his last two club
matches, Chelsea said.  Earlier today, the soccer champions confirmed captain and
defender John Terry will be out of England’s exhibition match
with France tomorrow because of leg pain. He will see
specialists because of the nerve problem, the club said.  Both players missed last weekend’s 3-0 home defeat to
Sunderland. Chelsea leads the league by two points over Arsenal.
The Blues next play at Birmingham on Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
