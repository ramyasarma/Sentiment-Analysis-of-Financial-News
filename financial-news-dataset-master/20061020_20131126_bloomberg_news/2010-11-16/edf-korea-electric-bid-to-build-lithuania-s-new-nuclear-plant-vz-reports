Lithuania received bids from
 Electricite de France SA  and  Korea Electric Power Corp.  to build
a nuclear power plant,  Verslo Zinios  reported today, citing
unidentified sources.  The Lithuanian government wants to select the winning
bidder by the end of this year as it seeks to replace the
Soviet-made Ignalina power plant that was shut in December.  Lithuania said in February that it had shortlisted five
companies that it declined to name to invest in and build the
power station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
