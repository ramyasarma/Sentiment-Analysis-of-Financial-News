EchoStar Corp. ’s $75 million
bankruptcy loan to  TerreStar Networks Inc. , a satellite
communications company, was approved by a judge over opposition
from TerreStar creditors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Sean Lane  in Manhattan today gave
final approval to the loan, which will fund TerreStar during its
bankruptcy. The judge previously approved a portion of the loan.  TerreStar , based in Reston, Virginia, provides satellite
mobile communications coverage. It filed for bankruptcy in
October with plans for a restructuring financed by EchoStar, a
television equipment and satellite company.  Under the proposed restructuring, EchoStar, based in
Englewood, Colorado, and other secured noteholders would swap
more than $940 million in  debt  for 97 percent of TerreStar’s
equity, according to court papers. EchoStar also would backstop
$100 million of a $125 million preferred-stock rights offering,
according to an affidavit filed at the beginning of the
bankruptcy.S  At the start of today’s court hearing, Marathon Asset
Management LP attorney  Philip Anker  said the hedge fund was
prepared to replace EchoStar as TerreStar’s bankruptcy lender
with its own $75 million loan.  Arik Preis, a lawyer for TerreStar, said Marathon, a
TerreStar creditor, only provided a term sheet without a
commitment. He said EchoStar’s loan is more attractive in any
case because it’s junior financing, allowing  TerreStar  to avoid
a court fight with senior creditors.  ‘Only Game in Town’  “At this point, we don’t have anything better,” Preis
said of the EchoStar financing. “We’re not willing to play
poker with our only game in town.”  In his ruling, Lane said the Marathon offer wasn’t a reason
to deny the EchoStar loan because there was no commitment and
because there was no evidence it was a superior proposal. Lane,
while approving the financing, denied one provision that would
have given EchoStar a lien on proceeds of certain lawsuits.  TerreStar creditors opposed the EchoStar financing, saying
it gives EchoStar too much control over the bankruptcy. They
said in court papers that EchoStar is using deadlines in the
financing to push TerreStar through bankruptcy quickly and win
approval for the EchoStar-backed plan.  TerreStar contacted more than 50 parties about financing,
Preis said, and the EchoStar loan was the best deal available.
If better financing comes along, TerreStar isn’t prevented from
accepting it, Preis said.  Rachel Strickland , a lawyer for EchoStar, said the company
isn’t trying to exert control over TerreStar.  “They are very much holding their own reins,” she said.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
