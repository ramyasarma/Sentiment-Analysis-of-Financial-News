Resimac Ltd., an Australian non-bank
lender, is seeking to issue A$400 million ($394 million) of
residential mortgage-backed bonds in its second sale of the
securities this year.  Resimac will issue five classes of notes, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Sydney-based lender today. One
portion with a weighted average life of 1.5 years is being
marketed to yield about 105 basis points more than the bank bill
swap rate, said a person familiar with the transaction, asking
not to be named as the price guidance is private.  Australia’s government will invest in the sale, Resimac
said. The Australian Office of Financial Management has bought
almost A$11.8 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities
under a A$16 billion program aimed at supporting smaller home-
loan providers reliant on securitization for funding, according
to its  website .  Resimac is marketing another class of notes, with a
weighted average life of 3.9 years, at a 200 basis-point spread,
the person familiar with the deal said.  The weighted average life is the expected tenor of the
principal outstanding to noteholders after taking into account
the forecast repayment schedule of the underlying mortgage
loans. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
