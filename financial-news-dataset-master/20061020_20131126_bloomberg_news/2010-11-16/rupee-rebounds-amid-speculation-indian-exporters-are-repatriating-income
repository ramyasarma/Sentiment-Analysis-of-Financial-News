India’s rupee rose for the first
time in four days on speculation exporters were repatriating
income after the currency yesterday sank to a seven-week low.  The rupee climbed the most in a week as exchange  data 
showed overseas funds pumped a record $28.5 billion into the
nation’s stocks this year, 90 percent more than in the same
period of 2009. Merchandise exports from India, Asia’s third-
largest economy, grew at a faster pace than  imports  for the
first time in five months in October,  Rahul Khullar , a commerce
ministry official, said yesterday.  “Exporters are capitalizing on every opportunity they are
getting and the present levels presented just that,” said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“There is scope for the dollar to weaken further.”  The currency rose 0.3 percent to 45.105 per dollar as of
9:41 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
yesterday touched 45.2475, the strongest level since Sept. 28.  Overseas shipments  in October rose 21.3 percent from a year
earlier to $18 billion,  Khullar  said. Imports rose 6.8 percent
to $27.7 billion.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.78 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.94 yesterday.
