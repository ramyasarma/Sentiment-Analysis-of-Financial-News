Boston Generating LLC, a New England
power company, will seek court approval this week for its
bankruptcy sale to  Constellation Energy Group Inc.  for
$1.1 billion after considering rival bids.  Boston Generating’s parent company, EBG Holdings LLC,
reviewed potential bids for the assets and concluded none met
the requirements of auction rules approved by a bankruptcy
judge, the company said today in a statement.  “This is yet another positive step toward ensuring the
continued uninterrupted operation of the assets by a financially
stable owner,”  Mark Sudbey , chief executive of US Power
Generating, EBG Holdings’ parent, said in the statement.  Boston Generating filed for bankruptcy in August with plans
to sell five power plants in the Boston area to Baltimore-based
Constellation for $1.1 billion subject to higher bids. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge  Shelley Chapman  in October approved an auction
for the assets. Boston Generating is scheduled to seek approval
for the sale on Nov. 17.  Creditors have filed objections to the sale, according to
court papers.  The case is In re Boston Generating LLC, 10-14419, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
