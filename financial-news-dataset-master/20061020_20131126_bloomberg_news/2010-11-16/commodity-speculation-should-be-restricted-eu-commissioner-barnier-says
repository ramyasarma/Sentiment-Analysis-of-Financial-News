Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services commissioner, said he would seek to limit
“risk exposures” derived from “agricultural products.”  Commodity speculation “can only lead to further
disasters,” Barnier said in a speech in Brussels today.  The European Commission , the 27-nation EU’s executive, has
targeted excessive market speculation in commodities which it
blames for making prices more volatile. Wheat traded in Chicago,
a global benchmark, almost doubled in price between July and
September as a drought in Russia, flooding in Canada and parched
fields in Kazakhstan and the European Union, ruined crops.
 Dacian Ciolos , the EU’s agriculture commissioner, has said that
price spike was “disproportionate.”  Barnier met earlier this month with U.S. officials
including  Gary Gensler , chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, and  Craig Donohue , chief executive officer
of  CME Group Inc. , the world’s largest futures market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
