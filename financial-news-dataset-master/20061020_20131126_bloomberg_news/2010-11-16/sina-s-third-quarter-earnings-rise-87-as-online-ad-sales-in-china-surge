Sina Corp. , owner of China’s third-
most visited website, said third-quarter profit climbed 87
percent as online advertising revenue surged.  Net income jumped to $31.3 million, or 48 cents a share,
from $16.7 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, Sina said today
in a statement. That compares with the $26.8 million average of
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sina added users for services such as microblogs and online
videos, boosting its website’s appeal to advertisers in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy. The Shanghai-based
company last week agreed to a partnership with Microsoft Corp.’s
local Internet venture on services including instant messages,
stepping up a challenge to industry leader  Tencent Holdings Ltd.   Revenue rose 12 percent to $108.2 million, helped by a 50
percent increase in online advertising sales, Sina said. Fourth-
quarter sales may be $103 million to $106 million, short of the
average $109.9 million estimate in the Bloomberg survey.  Sina fell 2.6  percent  to $56.99 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading today before the announcement. The stock has climbed 26
percent this year, compared with the 3 percent gain in the Hong
Kong-traded shares of Tencent, China’s biggest Internet company
by market value.  Sina’s website trails only  Baidu Inc. , China’s largest
search-engine, and  Tencent ’s QQ.com in popularity among Chinese
Internet users, according to  China Websites Ranking , a site run
by the Internet Society of China that compiles Web traffic
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
