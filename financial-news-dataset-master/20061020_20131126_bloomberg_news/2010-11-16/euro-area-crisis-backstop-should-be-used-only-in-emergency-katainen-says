Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki
Katainen said the euro area’s financial backstop, the European
Financial Stability Facility, should be used only in emergencies
and collateral should be required.   “I don’t want to use these mechanisms if not necessary,”
Katainen said to reporters in Brussels today before a meeting of
euro-area finance ministers. “And we want to ask collateral if
facilities are used.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
