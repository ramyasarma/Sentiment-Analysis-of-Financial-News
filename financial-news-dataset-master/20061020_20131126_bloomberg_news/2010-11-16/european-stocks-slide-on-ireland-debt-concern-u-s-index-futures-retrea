European stocks fell, led by a
selloff in basic-resources companies and banks, amid continued
concern about the ability of Ireland to tackle its debt. U.S.
index futures and Asian shares also retreated.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.8 percent to
270.25 at 8:02 a.m. in London, reversing yesterday’s 0.8 percent
rally. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
