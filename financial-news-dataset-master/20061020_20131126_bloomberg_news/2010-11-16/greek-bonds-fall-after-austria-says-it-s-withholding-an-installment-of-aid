Greek 10-year government bonds fell
after Austria said it has yet to release its next aid payment to
the nation.  The yield on the Greek security rose 12 basis points to
11.67 percent as of 2:02 p.m. in London.  Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell  told reporters in
Vienna today that Austria won’t release its contribution as
Greece hasn’t met its commitments to the European Union,
Austrian public broadcaster ORF reported, citing comments after
the government’s weekly cabinet meeting.  The December installment of aid would be about 190 million
euros ($259 million), ORF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
