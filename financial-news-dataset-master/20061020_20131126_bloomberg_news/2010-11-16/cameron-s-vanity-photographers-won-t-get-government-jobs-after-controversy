British Prime Minister David Cameron
reversed a decision to give two Conservative Party aides civil-
service jobs because it would send the “wrong signal” to
voters as he implements a fiscal-austerity plan.  Photographer Andrew Parsons and filmmaker Nicky Woodhouse
will return to posts in the Conservative Party headquarters and
carry out “purely party political” work, Cameron’s spokesman
Steve Field told reporters in London today. Parsons and
Woodhouse had been appointed to document the prime minister’s
work, particularly during trips.  “They were employed to do cross-government work and we
thought it would be an effective way to save money,” Field
said. “The prime minister has decided it sent the wrong signal
at this difficult time.”  Field said the decision to hire the aides was based on
advice from the civil service that, as party officials, they
wouldn’t be allowed access to Cameron when he is on government
business. Cameron intends to narrow Britain’s deficit to 2
percent of economic output by 2015 from more than 10 percent
today, by cutting 490,000 public-sector jobs and 18 billion
pounds ($29 billion) of welfare reductions.  Parsons was Cameron’s photographer when he was leader of
the opposition and Woodhouse made the WebCameron videos for the
party. Both had taken jobs at the Cabinet Office to carry out
similar work for different parts of the government.  The Evening Standard reported today that Parsons and
Woodhouse were to receive 35,000 pounds each annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
