 Senegal is constructing two wind
turbine parks along its northern shore, including a 125 megawatt
farm that will come online next year, Le Soleil reported, citing
Minister for Renewable Energy Louis Seck.  A second 50 megawatt plant will be built on the northern
shore in a different location, the newspaper reported.  The ministry also aims to cover 15 percent of national
energy needs by 2020 through bio-fuels, up from the current 0.6
percent, Seck said, according to the Dakar-based newspaper.  Senegal’s state power company currently produces 548
megawatts of electricity, according to its 2011 budget summary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
