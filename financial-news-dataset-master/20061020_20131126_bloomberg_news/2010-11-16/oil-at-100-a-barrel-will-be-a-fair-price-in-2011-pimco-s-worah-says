Crude oil prices may be “modestly
higher” a year from now at $100 a barrel, said  Mihir Worah  of
Pacific Investment Management Co.  That represents “a fair price,” Worah said in an
interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance
Midday” with Tom Keene. Worah runs the $18 billion Pimco
Commodity Real Return Strategy Fund, the largest commodity
mutual fund that tracks the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index.  Crude oil futures for December delivery dropped $2.27, or
2.7 percent, to $82.59 a barrel at 12:26 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Through yesterday, the commodity gained 6.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
