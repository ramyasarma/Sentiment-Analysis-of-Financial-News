A request by Ireland for aid from
the European Financial Stability Facility would increase
pressure on Portuguese government bonds, Citigroup Inc. said.  “Ireland is teetering on the edge of a potential bailout
package; other peripheral markets remain at considerable risk of
contagion,”  Steven Mansell , a fixed-income strategist in
London, wrote in an investor note today. “If Ireland does
eventually turn to the EFSF, this will likely exert considerable
pressure on Portugal, given their needs to tap the bond markets
during the first quarter of the New Year.”  Portuguese bonds rose today, sending the 10-year yield down
five basis points to 6.86 percent as of 12:44 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
