New York Giants wide receiver Steve
Smith won’t play until December due to a torn pectoral muscle,
ESPN reported, citing a person familiar with the situation.  Smith, 25, has 47 receptions for 517 yards and three
touchdowns this season. He didn’t play in the National Football
League team’s 33-20 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 14. The
Giants (6-3) next play at Philadelphia Nov. 21 and then are home
for the Jacksonville Jaguars on Nov. 28.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
