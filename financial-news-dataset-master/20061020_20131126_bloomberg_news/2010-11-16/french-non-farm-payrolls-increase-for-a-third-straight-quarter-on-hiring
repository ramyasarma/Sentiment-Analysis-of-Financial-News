French  companies  increased their
workforces in the three months through September for a third
straight quarter as companies resumed hiring in the wake of the
worst recession since World War II.  Payrolls, excluding government employees, farm workers and
the self-employed, climbed 0.3 percent from the second quarter,
Paris-based national statistics office Insee said in an e-mailed
statement today. French wages increased 0.3 percent in the
quarter, Insee said.  With the global economy reviving, French companies
including computer consultant Cap Gemini and lender  BNP Paribas
SA  have begun hiring in recent months. The resulting reduction
in unemployment is helping to underpin consumer spending and
keep the economy growing as President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s budget
cuts begin to bite.  To contact the reporter on this story:
