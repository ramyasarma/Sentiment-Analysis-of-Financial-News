The Australian dollar traded near
the lowest in more than two weeks as European leaders failed to
announce a bailout package for Ireland and China’s premier
fueled concern his nation will expand measures to curb
inflation.  New Zealand’s currency was near its lowest this month
after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said whole
milk powder prices fell at auction to the lowest in more than
three months. Both currencies declined yesterday as stocks
worldwide dropped after China’s Wen Jiabao said the Cabinet is
drafting measures to counter overly rapid price gains, spurring
concern that growth in Australia’s largest trading partner will
slow.  “The Aussie dollar has been directly affected by the
movement we’ve seen in risk appetite because of China tightening
concerns and news from the euro-zone,” said Ray Attrill, head
of macro strategy in Sydney at Tallship Investments, a currency
fund manager.  Australia’s currency traded at 97.75 U.S. cents at 9:33
a.m. in Sydney from 97.67 cents in New York yesterday, when it
touched 97.25 cents, the lowest level since Oct. 29. The
currency fetched 81.51 yen from 81.35 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 76.85 U.S. cents from 76.78
cents. It bought 64.08 yen from 63.94 yen.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
