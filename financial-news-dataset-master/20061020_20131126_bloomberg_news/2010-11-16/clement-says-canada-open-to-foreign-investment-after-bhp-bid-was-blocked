Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement said his country is open to foreign investment even
after he rejected BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion bid for Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  “We have a long-standing reputation for welcoming foreign
investment and a proven system in place for ensuring that those
investments provide a net benefit to Canada,” Clement said in
prepared notes for a speech he’s giving in Atlanta today. “We
welcome international investment for all the benefits it brings
including new ideas, sources of capital, and job creation.”  Clement rejected the offer from Melbourne-based BHP, the
world’s largest mining company, on Nov. 3, saying the proposal
doesn’t provide a “net benefit” to Canada. Under Canadian law,
BHP had 30 days from the date of the ruling to appeal. It chose
instead to drop its bid on Nov. 14. Clement’s decision was only
the nation’s second rejection of a foreign takeover in the past
25 years.  “After the company withdrew their bid on Sunday, I made
some brief comments on some of the reasons behind my interim
decision, but now that is a matter for the history books,”
Clement said.  Clement and Prime Minister Stephen Harper have said the
government may make changes to the foreign investment review
process in the Investment Canada Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
