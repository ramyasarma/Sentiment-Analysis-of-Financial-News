Treasury yields were near a one-week
low after Standard & Poor’s cut Ireland’s debt rating and stocks
tumbled around the world, fueling demand for the relative safety
of U.S. debt.  Notes held a three-day gain after advancing yesterday on
speculation Ireland’s financial crisis will spread and as North
and South Korea exchanged artillery fire. The U.S. is scheduled
to sell $29 billion of seven-year securities today, the last of
three auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  “There are lots of risks in the European markets,” said
 Tomohisa Fujiki , an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas
Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “The flight to quality is
supporting Treasuries.” BNP’s U.S. unit is one of the 18
primary dealers that trade directly with the Federal Reserve.  Ten-year notes  yielded  2.79 percent as of 9:52 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent
security due in November 2020 traded at a price of 98 19/32.  The rate has dropped 12 basis points or 0.12 percentage
point, over the previous three days. The yield slid to 2.73
percent yesterday, the least since Nov. 12.  S&P lowered Ireland’s long-term sovereign rating by two
steps to A from AA-, citing concern about government borrowing
as the nation seeks aid from the International Monetary Fund and
European Union.  The  MSCI World Index  of shares dropped 0.3 percent today
after slipping 1.7 percent yesterday, the most in a week.  Treasuries rose yesterday after North Korea fired artillery
shells near the border with the South, and German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said the 16-nation euro is in an “exceptionally
serious” situation.  Traders are betting Treasuries will be supported as
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis boosts demand for safer assets.  U.S. debt has returned 7.8 percent this year, compared with
2.8 percent for the 16-nation euro region, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
