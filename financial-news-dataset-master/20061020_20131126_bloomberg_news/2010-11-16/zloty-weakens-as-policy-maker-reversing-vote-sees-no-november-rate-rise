Polish bonds rose and the zloty
weakened after a policy maker who had voted for a rate increase
said the central bank shouldn’t lift borrowing costs this month.  The yield on bonds maturing in October 2012 dropped 3 basis
points to 4.79 percent as of 9:59 a.m. in Warsaw. One-year
interest-rate swaps, which investors use to protect themselves
against the risk of interest-rate changes, fell 6 basis points
to 4.41 percent, the lowest since Nov. 1. The zloty depreciated
0.3 percent to 3.9371 per euro.  The central bank still has time to consider an interest
rate increase and should take time to observe the movements of
the zloty currency,  Andrzej Bratkowski , a member of the rate-
setting Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview with TVN
CNBC television late yesterday.  Bratkowski had voted to raise the main rate by 50 basis
points in August, according to latest available voting records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
