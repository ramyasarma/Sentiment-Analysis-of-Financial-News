Mauritius’s stocks index rose to the
highest since June 2008 on expectations Finance Minister Pravind
Jugnauth will say prospects for the Indian Ocean island nation’s
economy are improving in his budget on Nov. 19.  The 37-member SEMDEX index gained 0.5 percent to 1,908.47
by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the capital. That’s the
first time the index has closed above the 1,900 level since June
10, 2008.  “It’s a psychological barrier,” Imrith Ramtohul, head of
investments at the Mauritius Union Assurance Co., said in a
phone interview from the city. “Crossing that mark three days
before the budget presentation is a good sign. It shows that
investors are rather confident in the prospects of the Mauritian
economy and is reflected by the continued interest for blue
chips and other stocks.”  The country’s central bank cut the benchmark repo rate to
4.75 percent on Sept. 27 to try to arrest slowing economic
growth in what Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said was an
exceptional one percentage-point interest-rate reduction. The
government has warned that weak economies in Europe, its main
trading region, may harm growth this year and in 2011.  Savannah Sugar Estates Co., a grower of the sweetener with
interests in property development, led gains, rising 5.9 percent
to 50 rupees, the highest in more than a month.  “I am confident that Savannah will do well in the future
as it doesn’t intend to take significant debt,” said Ramtohul,
who attended a meeting with company management today.  Mauritius Commercial Bank, the country’s largest lender by
market value, climbed 1.3 percent to 154 rupees, the highest
since October 2008. The lender said on Nov. 12 that first-
quarter profit advanced 20 percent to 945.8 million rupees ($32
million) from a year earlier.  “The bank has reported improved results for the first
quarter through September and is trading cum dividend of 2.50
rupees,” Ramtohul said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
