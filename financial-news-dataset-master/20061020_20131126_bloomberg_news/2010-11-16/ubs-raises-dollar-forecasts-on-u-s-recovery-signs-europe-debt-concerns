UBS AG raised one-month forecasts
for the dollar on signs of recovery in the U.S. economy and
lingering concerns about Europe’s fiscal problems.  The world’s second-largest foreign-exchange trader sees the
greenback advancing to $1.30 per euro in one month, compared
with its previous forecast of $1.40, according to a research
note dated yesterday. The U.S.  currency  may climb to 85 yen in
one month, from a previous target of 80 yen, it said.  “Europe’s fiscal troubles are set to continue and the U.S.
economy is starting to revive after summer weakness,” analysts
led by  Mansoor Mohi-uddin , a Singapore-based chief currency
strategist at UBS, wrote in the note. “We expect investors to
look more favorably on the dollar now.”  The dollar traded as strong as $1.3562 in Tokyo today, the
highest level since Sept. 30. The greenback traded at 83.14 yen
from 83.07 yesterday in New York, when it touched 83.27 yen,
matching the Oct. 6 high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
