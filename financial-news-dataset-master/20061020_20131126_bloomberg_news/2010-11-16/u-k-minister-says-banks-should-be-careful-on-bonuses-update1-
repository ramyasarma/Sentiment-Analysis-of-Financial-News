Banks should “think very
carefully” about staff bonuses as most Britons face tough times
ahead, according to U.K. Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban .  “The bonus round will go on when there is significant
fiscal consolidation,” he told a conference in London today.
“A lot of people are going to face tough times ahead. Banks are
going to have to think very carefully about the bonus round.”  The  Financial Services Authority  last week proposed rules
that would force banks to details bonus payouts at least once a
year. On Nov. 9, Business Secretary  Vince Cable  dismissed
warnings from British banks of a potential brain drain to Asia
if the government imposed tougher rules on bonuses.  Britain’s coalition government is implementing the biggest
public expenditure cuts since World War II, which may cost as
many as 500,000 jobs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
