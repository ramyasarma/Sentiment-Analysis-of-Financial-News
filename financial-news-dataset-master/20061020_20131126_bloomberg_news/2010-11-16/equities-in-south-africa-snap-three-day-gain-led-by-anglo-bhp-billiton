South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  snapped three days of gains, losing 288.43, or 0.9
percent, to 31,528.18 as at 11:22 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, fell 4.19 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 335.21 rand. Copper
retreated  as much as 1.6 percent to $8,510 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. Lead, aluminum and nickel also dropped.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, declined for the third consecutive day, losing
3.34 rand, or 1 percent, to 341.91 rand. George Soros, who
described the metal’s surge as “the ultimate asset bubble,”
cut his holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust by 10 percent. Gold
swung between losses and gains amid signs that the U.S. economy
may be strengthening while Ireland may have to accept a European
Union bailout.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, slipped for the second time in three days, dropping
4.81 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 264.19 rand. The company has been
called to testify before an Australian parliamentary committee
investigating the government’s planned 30 percent tax on iron
ore and coal profits.  Copper resumed a decline in London and New York on concern
that China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, may take
further steps to cool price gains, damping demand for
commodities. Zinc, lead and tin fell.  Foschini Ltd.  (TFG SJ), a South African clothing retailer,
declined for the third day in four, losing 40 cents, or 0.5
percent, to 88.99 rand. The company releases first-half earnings
later today.  Metorex Ltd.  (MTX SJ), a cobalt and copper producer,
retreated 18 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 4.65 rand, a fourth day
of decreases. Metorex said output at its Ruashi mine in the
Democratic Republic of Congo has been reduced by recurring
electrical faults and is operating at reduced throughput of 50
percent.  Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, fell 4.14 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 333.01 rand.
Oil slumped for the third consecutive day, dropping as much as
0.9 percent to $84.32 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
