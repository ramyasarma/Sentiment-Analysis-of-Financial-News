Japanese  stocks  retreated, with a
gauge of utilities dropping the most in a month as a weak yen
boosted costs for fuel. Trading companies declined as commodity
prices weakened.  Tokyo Gas Co. , Japan’s No. 1 natural-gas distributor, sank
1.6 percent. Mitsui & Co., which counts commodities as its
biggest source of profit, and Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest oil-
explorer, dropped at least 0.8 percent after oil prices weakened.
Nippon Yusen KK, Japan’s leading shipping line by sales, fell
1.1 percent to 354 yen after cargo tariffs dropped. Declines by
power producers overshadowed the benefits of a weaker yen for
exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest carmaker,
climbed 0.5 percent.  “The decline in utilities has to do with the weak yen
because they have to buy oil, which is priced in U.S. dollars,”
said  Hidehiro Tomioka , who helps manage $1.4 billion in Tokyo at
MFC Global Investment Management (Japan) Ltd. “Commodity
weakness is partly due to the strong U.S. dollar, and concern
about a possible slowdown in China’s growth.”  The  Topix  index slid 0.5 percent to 847.77 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with more than two stocks falling for each
