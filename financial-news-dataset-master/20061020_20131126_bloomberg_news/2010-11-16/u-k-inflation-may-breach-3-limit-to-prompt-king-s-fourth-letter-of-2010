U.K. inflation probably exceeded the
government’s 3 percent ceiling in October, forcing Bank of
England Governor  Mervyn King  to write a letter of explanation to
the Treasury for the fourth time this year.  Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, the
same pace as in September, the median forecast of 28 economists
in a  Bloomberg News survey  shows. The Office for National
Statistics will release the data at 9:30 a.m. today in London.
The governor must write a letter every three months when
inflation exceeds the government limit.  King said when presenting forecasts last week that there
was an equal chance of the rate exceeding or undershooting the
central bank’s 2 percent target. Policy makers split three ways
in October on whether to act to combat inflation or nurture
 economic growth  with more so-called quantitative easing, and
they kept their emergency  bond  plan unchanged this month.  “The November inflation report has helped change the tenor
of quantitative easing, and higher inflation in the next few
months will underscore that even more,” said  David Tinsley , an
economist at National Australia Bank in London and a former Bank
of England official. “By February, inflation projections will
be raised again so by then QE will be off the table.”  October would be the eighth month in a row that inflation
has been above 3 percent. The rate has exceeded the limit in
every month this year apart from February. The central bank
predicts increases in commodity costs and higher sales tax will
keep it above the 2 percent goal through 2011, masking
underlying subdued price pressures from the recession.  Weale’s View  “Inflation over the next few months may well rise further,
even if a subsequent decline is expected,” policy maker  Martin Weale  said yesterday. “I certainly worry about the effect on
inflationary expectations of introducing additional monetary
stimulus,” though he said his estimate of the degree of spare
capacity in the economy would justify more aid.  King said on Nov. 10 that there is a “high probability”
inflation will exceed the upper limit long enough for him to
have to write a letter. The governor must correspond with the
chancellor of the exchequer when the rate deviates more than a
percentage point from 2 percent in either direction.  The central bank will publish King’s letter and finance
minister  George Osborne ’s response at 10:30 a.m. in London, an
hour after the data. King, Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  and Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  will testify on the
economy to lawmakers in the House of Lords, Parliament’s upper
chamber, at 3:30 p.m.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee on Nov. 4 kept
its bond-purchase plan at 200 billion pounds ($321 billion) and
its  interest rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent. In October,
 Andrew Sentance  called for higher interest rates to combat
inflation, while  Adam Posen  pushed for more stimulus to sustain
the recovery. Minutes of this month’s decision are due tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
