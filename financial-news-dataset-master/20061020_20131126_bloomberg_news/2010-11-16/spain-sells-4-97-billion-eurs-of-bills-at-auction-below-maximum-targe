Spain sold 5 billion euros ($6.8
billion) of Treasury bills, less than the maximum target of 5.5
billion euros set for its regular monthly auction, the Bank of
Spain said.  The Treasury sold 3.73 billion euros of 12-month bills at
an average yield of 2.363 percent, compared with 1.842 percent
when the securities were last sold on Oct. 19. It also sold 1.24
billion euros of 18-month bills at 2.664 percent compared with
2.009 percent last month. Demand for the 12-month paper was 1.9
times the amount sold, compared with 2.06 times in October, and
3.66 times for the longer-dated bills, up from 2.03 last month.  Spain is facing higher borrowing costs as the capital needs
of Ireland’s banking industry threaten to deepen the sovereign
debt crisis that was triggered by Greece. Euro-region finance
ministers meet today in Brussels while European Central Bank
officials urge Ireland to tap the 750 billion-euro fund created
in May to prevent the crisis from spreading.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
benchmark  bonds  instead of German equivalents rose 5 basis
points today to 199 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
