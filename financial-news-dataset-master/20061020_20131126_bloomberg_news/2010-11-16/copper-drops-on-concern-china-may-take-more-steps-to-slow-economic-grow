Copper prices fell the most in four
months and zinc plunged 8.5 percent on concern that China will
act to slow its economy, eroding demand for metals.  The  London Metals Index , tracking six components including
lead and tin, slumped 6.3 percent, the biggest drop since May 4,
on bets that China will curb growth to rein in inflation. Copper
also fell amid signs a strike may be ending at a mine that is
the world’s fourth-largest source of the metal.  “There is broad-based selling in the market because of
China,” said  Michael K. Smith , the president of T&K Futures &
Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida. “Also, this news about the
strike coming to an end is pushing prices further down.”  Copper futures for March delivery dropped 19.35 cents, or
4.9 percent, to settle at $3.731 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. That’s the biggest drop since June 29.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months declined $495, or 5.7 percent, to $8,150 a metric ton
($3.70 a pound).  Zinc  for delivery in three months declined $199, or 8.5
percent, to $2,139 a ton, the most since October 2008.  China’s Premier Wen Jiabao said today that the cabinet is
drafting measures to counter the fastest inflation in two years.
The country is the world’s biggest metals consumer.  ‘Not Much Buying’  “What I think is significant is we did not see much sign
of China buying today,” said  Alex Heath , the head of
industrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in
London.  Copper has rallied fivefold since 2002 as growth in
emerging markets boosted demand for the metal used in buildings
and electric grids.  Workers at Chile’s Collahuasi mine indicated for the first
time that they may make concessions to end a 12-day walkout.
Metals also fell after U.S. government reports signaled no
growth in industrial production and low inflation.  On the LME, lead dropped 8.1 percent to $2,256 a ton, the
biggest drop since Sept. 10, 2009. Nickel, aluminum and tin all
fell more than 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
