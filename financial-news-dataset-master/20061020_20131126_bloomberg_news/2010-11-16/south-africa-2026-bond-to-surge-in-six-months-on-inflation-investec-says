South Africa’s 10.5 percent
government bond due December 2026 will surge, reducing yields by
more than 100 basis points over the next six months as inflation
“surprises to the downside,” Investec Asset Management said.  The yield on the security, which is known by traders as the
R186, is likely to fall as low as 7 percent by the end of the
second quarter of 2011, according to Andre Roux, the Cape Town-
based head of fixed income at Investec Asset Management, which
oversees about $70 billion in assets. The bond retreated 1 cent
to 121.40 rand by 10:35 a.m. in Johannesburg, raising the yield
by 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.11 percent.  “We don’t think the bond market has fully priced in the
benign inflation outlook,” Roux said in an interview.
“Inflation will probably stay in the bottom half of the Reserve
Bank’s target band for the next 18 months and will be around 4
percent by the end of 2011.” South Africa’s central bank
targets an inflation rate of 3 to 6 percent.  South African bond yields have slumped to record lows as
slowing economic growth and a 35 percent rally in the rand since
the start of last year helped curb inflation, giving the central
bank room to reduce interest rates. Growth in Africa’s biggest
economy slowed to 3.2 percent in the second quarter, from 4.6
percent in the first three months of the year, while consumer-
price increases eased to a five-year low, curbing the erosive
effects of inflation on the real value of fixed-income assets.  Rates, Rand  Inflation decelerated to 3.2 percent in September, the
ninth straight monthly decline, and the lowest rate since June
2005. That helped the central bank reduce its repurchase rate to
6 percent, the lowest since it was first introduced in 1999.  Roux expects the South African Reserve Bank to lower its
main interest rate for a ninth time since December 2008 when it
announces its next decision on Nov. 18.  “We think they’ll cut by another 50 basis points at this
meeting and keep the door open for another cut later on,” said
Roux. Slowing economic growth, easing inflation and the strength
of the rand mean the central bank would be justified in lowering
borrowing costs, he said.  Investec expects South Africa’s rand, the best-performing
emerging-market currency since the start of last year along with
Brazil’s real, to remain “more or less at current levels” over
the next six months, according to Roux. The rand weakened 0.5
percent to 6.9835 per dollar, compared with a previous close of
6.9474.  The brokerage also expects oil to average “about $80 a
barrel” over the period, Roux said. A sudden rally in oil
prices or a sharp decline in the rand may prompt the brokerage
to revise its estimates, Roux said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
