Macau Chief Executive  Fernando Chui 
said the Chinese city will tighten control of the number of new
casinos, gaming tables and slot machines, Xinhua News Agency
said, citing Chui’s annual policy address.  Regulators will also enhance supervision of casinos,
especially in auditing of financial records, Chui said, as cited
by Xinhua. The city will also seek to optimize gaming laws and
regulations to stabilize industry development, he said.  Macau will exclude casinos from allowed uses for land newly
filled in from the sea, instead earmarking it for public housing
and industries that will help the economy expand beyond
gambling, Chui said.  The city will continue to support the development of new
industries, focusing on Meeting, Incentive, Convention and
Exhibition travel, culture and creativity, traditional chinese
medicine and business and trade services, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
