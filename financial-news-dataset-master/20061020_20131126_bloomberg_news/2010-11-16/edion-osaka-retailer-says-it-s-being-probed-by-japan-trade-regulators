Edion Corp., which operates
electronics retail chains, is being probed by Japanese trade
regulators, a company spokeman said.  “It’s true that we are being investigated by Japan’s Fair
Trade Commision,” Masayuki Okajima, a spokesman for the Osaka-
based company, said today by telephone. “We can’t make any
comment because we haven’t been informed of the details of the
allegation.”  Kyodo News reported that the company is being investigated
for violation of the anti-monopoly law. Isao Kasubuchi, a
spokesman at Japan’s Fair Trade Commission, declined to comment
on the report when contacted by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
