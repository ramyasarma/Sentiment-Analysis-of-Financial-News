An announcement of an Irish rescue
package may offer only temporary relief for the euro because
investors may turn to other so-called peripheral countries in
the single-currency region, according to Barclays Plc.  “While we continue to see the possibility of an
announcement spurring a temporary relief rally, growing concerns
over other peripheral countries are expected to keep the euro
weak over the medium term,” wrote London-based currency
strategist  Sara Yates  in a research note today.  Ireland is in talks with European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials about a bailout that would shore up the
state’s finances as well as enable it to inject capital into the
country’s banks, said a European official with direct knowledge
of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for
the Irish central bank and Finance Ministry declined to comment.  Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  told state broadcaster RTE
in an interview late yesterday that Ireland was in discussions
with “partners” on how best to stabilize its banking system.
He repeated the government hasn’t asked for a bailout.  The euro depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.3525 as of 4:41 p.m.
in London, the lowest level since Sept. 28, after strengthening
0.5 percent to $1.3656.  To contact the reporter on this story:
