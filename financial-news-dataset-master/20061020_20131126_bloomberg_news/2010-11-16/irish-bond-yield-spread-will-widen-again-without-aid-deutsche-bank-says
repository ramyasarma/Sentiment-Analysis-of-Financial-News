The  extra yield  investors demand to
hold Irish government bonds instead of benchmark German bunds
would widen, reversing a recent drop, should the Dublin
government fail to request a bailout, Deutsche Bank AG said.  “The recent  rally  increases the chances that Ireland won’t
ask for any aid but the reality is that spreads are at risk of
rewidening if they don’t,” strategists  Jim Reid  in London and
 Colin Tan  in Sydney wrote in an investor note today. “The
market seems to pounce on any uncertainty and ambiguity. It’s
now unlikely to rest until it’s provoked the use of the support
mechanisms put in place in May or until we have a much stronger
commitment of support beyond 2013.”  The difference in yield between Irish and German 10-year
bonds was little changed at 541 basis points as of 9 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
