The Federal Reserve would reduce its
planned purchases of $600 billion in Treasuries only after a
substantial improvement in the U.S. economy, St. Louis Fed
President  James Bullard  said.  “The economy would have to improve a fair amount before
the whole committee would pull back on that,” Bullard said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays
Advantage,” with  Kathleen Hays . “I think that is a
possibility, but it would depend on hard data that would force
us to reassess where the economy is going in the future.”  The Fed on Nov. 3 said it would buy more Treasuries through
June, expanding record stimulus to try to reduce 9.6 percent
unemployment and keep inflation from dropping. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is trying to boost growth after near-zero interest
rates and $1.7 trillion in securities purchases helped pull the
economy out of recession without bringing down joblessness close
to a 26-year high.  Bullard said he favored a rule, similar to the Taylor rule
for setting the federal funds rate, that would adapt the level
of the Fed’s easing to incoming data on the economy and
inflation. He said he didn’t favor setting a $600 billion asset
purchase target, preferring a smaller number that would be
adjusted at each Fed meeting, although he voted for the policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
