Lenovo Group Ltd. , China’s biggest
maker of personal computers, fell the most in almost three weeks
in Hong Kong trading after TPG Inc. and General Atlantic LLC
were said to have sold their holdings.  Lenovo shares slipped 1.8 percent to close at HK$5.43, the
biggest decline since Oct. 27, after slumping as much as 5.6
percent earlier. This compared with a 1.4 percent drop in Hong
Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  TPG and General Atlantic sold 282.3 million Lenovo shares,
their entire holdings, at HK$5.451 apiece, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. The price is at the low end of a
marketed range, according to the person, who declined to be
identified before a public announcement.  “It is not appropriate for us to comment on the strategic
investors and their plans of dealing with Lenovo shares,”
 Angela Lee , a spokeswoman at Lenovo in Hong Kong, said today.  General Atlantic, TPG and its unit Newbridge Capital owned
a combined 2.8 percent stake in Lenovo, according to the Chinese
company’s website. The private-equity firms, investors in the
computer maker since 2005, began reducing their holdings in
2007, according to Bloomberg data.  TPG founder  James G Coulter  and General Atlantic Managing
Director  William Grabe  are members of Lenovo’s board of
directors.  Nomura Holdings Inc.  is the sole bookrunner on the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
