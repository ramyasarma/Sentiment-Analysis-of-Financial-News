Israel is easing restrictions on the
movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem
during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday. The army said in an e-
mailed statement today that it is removing 24 West Bank
roadblocks, extending the hours at crossings from Israel and
letting more Palestinians enter a holy area in Jerusalem’s Old
City for Friday prayers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
