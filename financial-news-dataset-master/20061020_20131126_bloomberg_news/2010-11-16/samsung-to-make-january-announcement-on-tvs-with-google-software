Samsung Electronics Co ., the world’s
largest television maker, is planning to make an announcement in
January about introducing TVs using Google Inc.’s software, as
the company aims to spur demand.  Details of the plan have yet to be decided, Yoon Boo Keun,
head of Samsung’s TV business, said in Seoul. The company is
“open” to using Intel Corp.’s chips for its TVs, Yoon said.  A partnership between Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung and
Google will follow a similar move by  Sony Corp.,  the world’s
third-largest TV maker. In October, the Japanese company began
offering Internet-enabled TVs in the U.S. as consumer
electronics manufacturers try to combat falling prices with
products based on new technology.  Internet-enabled TVs will let viewers buy third-party video
games and programs that do anything from forecasting the weather
to measuring the string tension of a tennis racket.  Apple Inc. 
fueled its expansion into music players and phones by developing
the iTunes software that made it easier to buy and organize
songs, TV shows and games and is expanding the model to
television.  In October, Samsung, also the world’s largest maker of
memory chips and flat screens, forecast “severe” price
competition in the TV industry in the fourth quarter after its
digital-media division posted a loss of about 230 billion won
($204 million) in the three months ended September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
