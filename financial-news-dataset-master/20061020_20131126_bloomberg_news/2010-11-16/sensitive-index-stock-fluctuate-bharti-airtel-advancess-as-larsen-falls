India’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in more than five months amid speculation
central banks may raise borrowing costs to cool inflation,
restricting cash available for equities.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
copper producer, slid as metal prices slumped. Overseas
investors have pushed the main stock gauge to near a record.
 Tata Motors Ltd. , the largest truckmaker, sank the most in more
than five months. While the Bank of Korea today raised interest
rates, India’s central bank Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said on
Nov. 2 that it may refrain from boosting them, in part, to ward
off the risk of fund inflows stoking inflation.  “Each one is trying to protect its own turf, and that adds
to the complexities,” said  Ravi Gopalakrishnan , Chief
Investment Officer for equities at Pramerica Asset Managers
Pvt., the local unit of Prudential International Investments
Advisers LLC. with $750 billion in assets globally. Investors
“are taking some money off the table.” He’s avoiding property
shares as their gains may be limited as interest rates rise.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 444.55, or 2.2 percent, to 19,865.14, its steepest fall
since June 1 and lowest close since Sept. 23, as of the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National
Stock Exchange dropped 2.2 percent to 5,988.70. The  BSE 200
Index  retreated 2.1 percent to 2,524.95. Indian markets are
closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  China’s Inflation  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at  18.8 times  earnings
after jumping 14 percent this year, the best performance and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge sank 4
percent last week, retreating from a Nov. 5 record of 21,004.96,
after the nation’s factory production slumped to a 16-month low
and amid speculation China will increase borrowing costs.  Sterlite plunged 5.4 percent to 172.85 rupees. Copper
dropped as much as 1.5 percent in London on concern that China,
the world’s biggest metals consumer, may take further steps to
cool price gains, damping demand for commodities. Aluminum, zinc
and lead fell.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum
producer, sank 5.4 percent to 211.9 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the
biggest producer of the alloy, lost 2 percent to 605.95 rupees.  Fund Inflows  “Risk aversion among investors is high,” said  Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New Delhi-based
brokerage. “And that can happen due to any global reason as we
saw last week. That’s the only concern for Indian stock markets
as the rally has been led by foreign inflows.”  Tata Motors slid 3.7 percent to 1,205.55 rupees, its
steepest fall since June 7.  Reliance Industries Ltd. , the most
valuable company, lost 2.3 percent to 1,030.5 rupees, its
biggest loss since Aug. 31.  South Korea, along with economies from Thailand to Taiwan,
is struggling to contain price pressures while at the same time
avoid exchange-rate gains fanned by foreign fund inflows.
India’s rupee climbed today to the highest level per dollar in
more than seven weeks as exchange data showed overseas funds
pumped the most ever money into the nation’s stocks this year.  Overseas  investors  sold a net  6.83 billion rupees  ($153
million) of Indian shares on Nov. 12, paring this year’s record
flows to 1.295 trillion rupees, according to data on the  website 
of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
