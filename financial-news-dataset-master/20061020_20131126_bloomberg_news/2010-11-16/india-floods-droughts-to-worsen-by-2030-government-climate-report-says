India may endure floods 30 percent
more severe in magnitude and heightened drought conditions by
2030 due to climate change, which could affect crop yields,
damage dams and harm infrastructure, the government said today.  “There is no country in the world that is as vulnerable on
so many dimensions to climate change as India is,” Environment
Minister  Jairam Ramesh  said in a  climate-change report  prepared
by 220 scientists in the country.  Every India region is expected to see more rainfall by the
2030s, each with 5 to 10 more days annually of “extreme
precipitation,” the report said. Flooding will have a “very
severe implication for existing infrastructure such as dams,
bridges, roads.”  Rising greenhouse-gas levels are projected to raise the
average annual temperature across India, which with 1.2 billion
people is the second-most populous nation after China, by as
much as 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the 2030s,
it said.  The changing conditions may boost yields of irrigated rice
and coconuts while depressing those of corn and sorghum, reduce
milk productivity from livestock and cause malaria to spread to
new areas, the report said.  The frequency of droughts is already increasing, especially
in the Himalayan region where the degree of severity has
increased by more than 20 percent since the 1970s, it said.  The report is the government’s first attempt to assess the
impact of climate change by the 2030s, it said. Previous
assessments made projections for the 2070s and beyond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
