Eileen Gray will be among the names
featured in a collection of 20th-century design that is
estimated to sell for a record 60 million euros ($82 million) in
Paris.  The three-day auction may exceed the total of 59.2 million
euros set on Feb. 24, 2009, with the sale of Art Deco works
owned by the late fashion designer  Yves Saint Laurent  and his
partner  Pierre Berge . That auction, part of a three-day event,
had a high estimate of 28.3 million euros and set a record for
20th-century decorative art. It transformed the market when
Gray’s “dragons” armchair fetched a record 21.9 million euros.  The Gourdon Collection of Art Nouveau, Art Deco and
modernist design will be sold by  Christie’s International  at the
Palais de Tokyo on March 29-31, 2011. The 500 works are owned by
French collector Laurent Negro, who has been buying 20th-century
design since the 1990s. The pieces were put on display in a
private museum at his medieval castle, the Chateau de Gourdon,
near Grasse in Provence, in 2003, said Christie’s.  “He’s very private, knowledgeable and highly regarded,”
London-based dealer  Sean Berg  said in an interview. “The
collection is staggeringly good,” said Berg, who is selling 140
pieces of modernist design at Christie’s London tomorrow. The
auction house would not say why Negro is selling.  “It’s just a personal decision,” Capucine Millot,
Christie’s Paris-based head of public relations, said in an
interview.  Negro has the same name as his father, who died in 1997 and
was the founder of the temporary employment company, Bis SA
which was taken over by Vendex International NV.  The Gourdon Collection includes 15 pieces by Irish-born
Gray. Her 1920s black lacquer “Brick” screen and coated canvas
“Transat” armchair are both estimated to sell for as much as
1.5 million euros.  A late 1920s black lacquer “Tardieu” writing desk,
estimated at as much as 3 million euros, is one of 45 Art Deco
pieces by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann included in the sale.  A unique games table designed by Jean Dunand in 1930 for
the couturier Madeleine Vionnet is the most highly estimated
lot, at 3 million euros to 5 million euros.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes for Muse, the arts and culture
