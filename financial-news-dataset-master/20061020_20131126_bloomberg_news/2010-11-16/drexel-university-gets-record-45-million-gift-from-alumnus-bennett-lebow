Bennett LeBow , chairman and chief
executive officer of bookseller  Borders Group Inc. , donated $45
million to Drexel University, the largest gift in its history.  LeBow’s contribution will fund construction of a $92
million building for the LeBow College of Business, which was
named after him in 1999, the Philadelphia-based university said
today in an e-mailed  statement . LeBow, who graduated from Drexel
in 1960 with a degree in electrical engineering, has given the
university a total of $60 million.  LeBow is chairman of  Vector Group Ltd. , a Miami-based
holding company for cigarette maker Liggett Group LLC. In May,
LeBow invested $25 million in Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Borders
to become its largest shareholder. The new business school
building will replace a facility built in 1965, according to the
Drexel statement.  “A new and beautiful building will help us better connect
with the Philadelphia business communities and allow our
students to learn in a setting that is less like a classroom and
more like the corporate environment,” said George Tsetsekos,
dean of the business college.  Drexel was founded in 1891 by Philadelphia financier
 Anthony Drexel .  To contact the reporter on this story:  Oliver Staley  in New York
