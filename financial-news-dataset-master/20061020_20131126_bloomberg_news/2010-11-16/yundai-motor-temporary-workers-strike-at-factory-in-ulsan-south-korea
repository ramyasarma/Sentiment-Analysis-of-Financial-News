Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
 biggest carmaker , said a sit-in protest at a factory in the
nation stopped the production of 922 vehicles worth 7.9 billion
won ($7 million).  The Seoul-based company was forced to halt production at
the plant in Ulsan, southeast of the capital, after 600 contract
workers began striking yesterday afternoon, Hyundai said in an
e-mail. The protesters are demanding the same status as
permanent employees and the strike is ongoing, Lee Sang Su, a
spokesman for the temporary workers’ union, said by phone today.  Chang Kyu Ho , spokesman for Hyundai’s regular workers’
union, said its members aren’t participating in the protest.  Hyundai Motor rose 2.6 percent to 181,000 won at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Seoul. The stock has gained 50 percent in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
