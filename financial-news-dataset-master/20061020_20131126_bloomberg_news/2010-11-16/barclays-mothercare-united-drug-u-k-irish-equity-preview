U.K. stocks rose, led by Experian
Plc and  GlaxoSmithKline Plc , as the European Union started work
on a possible aid package for Ireland’s banks and British
jobless claims unexpectedly fell.  Experian, the world’s biggest credit-checking company,
surged the most in 19 months after earnings increased. Glaxo,
the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, gained 2.4 percent as its lupus
drug won support from U.S. officials.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  rose 10.66, or 0.2 percent, to
5,692.56 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, rebounding from
yesterday’s 2.4 percent tumble. The FTSE All-Share Index also
climbed 0.2 percent. Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 1.5 percent.  The EU and International Monetary Fund will start scanning
the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow. Euro-area
finance chiefs said the assessment will determine whether
Ireland can patch up the banking system on its own or must fall
back on a 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) rescue fund.  “Investors are closely watching the tug of war between the
ECB, which funds Irish banks, and the Irish government,” said
 Ross Porter , a co-manager in charge of $1.6 billion of equity
investments at Stavanger, Norway-based Skagen Fund. “If the
Irish take the package, the ECB is off the hook being the sole
funder of the banks and the lenders will likely be able to get
funding from other sources as well.”  No Timetable  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said that no timetable
has been set for ending the talks, though the situation is
“urgent.” Lenihan said that the U.K. is “anxious” that
Ireland gets any aid that’s needed, though he declined to say
whether Britain will contribute to financial assistance. He
spoke in an interview with state broadcaster RTE.  The ECB stands “fully” behind Irish banks and there are
no funding issues, Lenihan said.  U.K.  jobless claims  unexpectedly fell in October,
suggesting the labor market is recovering momentum as the
prospect of a record budget squeeze looms. The number of people
receiving unemployment benefits declined by 3,700 from September
to 1.47 million, the first drop since July, the Office for
National Statistics said today. The median forecast of 23
economists was for a rise of 6,000.  Experian  jumped 6.3 percent to 748 pence, the biggest gain
since April 2009. The company said first-half net income rose to
$260 million, from $249 million a year earlier. Sales for the
six months to Sept. 30 were $2 billion.  Glaxo, ICAP  Glaxo climbed 2.4 percent to 1,243 pence, rising the most
since Nov. 5. The company’s Benlysta lupus drug won backing from
an advisory panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  ICAP Plc advanced 1.3 percent to 472 pence, paring
yesterday’s 2.4 percent slide. The world’s biggest interdealer
broker said first-half pretax profit rose 2 percent to 183
million pounds ($292 million). Revenue increased 9 percent to
867 million pounds.  3i Group Plc  declined 1.9 percent to 309 pence, its third
straight drop. The private-equity firm said the price of
leveraged buyout targets is at an “extraordinarily” high
level, Chief Executive Officer  Michael Queen  told a conference
in Paris today.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
