Southern California home sales
plunged last month as purchases of foreclosure properties
declined and loans were hard to get, MDA DataQuick said.  Sales dropped 24 percent from a year earlier to 16,744
homes in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San
Bernardino and Orange counties, MDA DataQuick said today in a
statement. That was the lowest level for an October since 2007,
and the second-lowest number for the month since the San Diego-
based company began collecting data in 1988.  Sales of foreclosure properties accounted for 35 percent of
the Southern California resale market last month, down from 40
percent a year earlier and a record 57 percent in February 2009,
MDA DataQuick said. The median home price was $283,000, up 1.1
percent from a year earlier and down 4.2 percent from September.  “Builders can’t build at a low enough price to compete
with the inventory of resale homes, many of which are short
sales or foreclosures,”  John Walsh , MDA DataQuick’s president,
said in the statement. Scarce lending for pricier properties
means “move-up” home purchases are down as well, he said.  Ventura County had the steepest sales drop from a year
earlier at 30 percent, and was the only Southern California
region with a price decline. The median in Ventura fell 2.7
percent to $355,000, MDA DataQuick said. Riverside had the
biggest price increase, rising 4.2 percent to $198,000.  Gains Since December  The  regional median  has gained every month since December
on a year-over-year basis. Prices bottomed at $247,000 in April
2009 after peaking at $505,000 in mid-2007, said MDA DataQuick,
a unit of Richmond, British Columbia-based  MacDonald, Dettwiler
& Associates Ltd.   Southern California sales last month were 31 percent below
the average 24,123 for October.  Move-up properties have lost about half as much value as
entry-level homes in the housing slump, while financing is
difficult as banks restrict lending, according to Walsh. Even
buyers with a 20 percent down payment are finding the purchase
process a “real grind,” he said.  MDA DataQuick compiles surveys using county records and
supplies real-estate information to public agencies, lenders and
title companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
