The Australian unit of  Lloyds TSB
Bank Plc , part of the U.K.’s largest mortgage lender, started
marketing its debut sale of bonds in the South Pacific nation.  The sale of three-year notes will be benchmark in size,
according to an e-mailed statement from Macquarie Group Ltd.,
which is helping to manage the offering. The bonds may be priced
to yield about 190 basis points more than swap rates, according
to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
named as the price guidance is private.  The 201 members of Morgan Stanley Capital International’s
 World Banks Index , which includes Lloyds Banking Group Plc, need
investors to help refinance $3 trillion of bonds coming due by
the end of next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
European banks including ING Groep NV, BNP Paribas SA and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc have raised A$18.8 billion through
selling bonds in Australia this year, the data show.  “Australia has a strong demand for debt investments and
offshore issuers obviously have a need for funding,” said Scott
Rundell, head of credit research at ING Investment Management in
Sydney.  “It’s a case of continued diversification from the
issuers’ perspective.”  Lloyds TSB, based in London, started marketing a sale of its
first Samurai bonds yesterday, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter.  Benchmark typically means at least A$500 million ($492.4
million). A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
