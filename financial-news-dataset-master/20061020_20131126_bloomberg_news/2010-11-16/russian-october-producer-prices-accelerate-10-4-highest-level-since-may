Russian  producer-price growth , an
early indicator of inflation trends, accelerated in October to
the highest level since May, exceeding economists’ estimates.  The price of goods leaving factories and mines jumped an
annual 10.4 percent after a 5.9 percent increase in September,
the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-
mailed statement. The median forecast of five economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 8 percent.  “An increase in oil prices likely had an effect,”  Natalia Orlova , chief economist at Alfa Bank, Russia’s biggest private
lender, said today by telephone.  Urals crude  rose to as much as
$83.82 a barrel in October from an average of $77.43 the
previous month, according to Bloomberg data.  Russia consumer prices have risen for the past three months
after the country’s worst drought in at least half a century
pushed up food prices. Annual inflation accelerated to 7.5
percent in October from 5.5 percent in July. The government’s
annual  inflation  forecast for 2010 is 8 percent.  Mining and quarrying companies saw crude oil prices rise
4.4 percent in October, the statistics service said. The price
of metallurgical coke used by manufacturers increased 4.4
percent, it said.  Factory-gate prices climbed 2.2 percent from the previous
month after falling 1.3 percent in September, the service said.
Economists estimated no monthly price growth in October,
according to the survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
