Chad Pennington ’s return as the
Miami Dolphins’ starting quarterback lasted two passes before he
suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.  Pennington, 34, was placed on injured reserve today, a day
after he was hurt while throwing a pass on the Dolphins’ first
offensive play in a 29-17 win over Tennessee. Pennington, whose
2009 season also ended because of an injury to his throwing
shoulder, was replaced one play later by  Chad Henne .  Henne, who had lost his starting job to Pennington, left
yesterday’s game in the third quarter with a knee injury. His
status for the Nov. 18 game against the Chicago Bears isn’t
known.  Third-string quarterback  Tyler Thigpen  finished yesterday’s
game. To replace Pennington on the roster, the Dolphins signed
 Patrick Ramsey , who has started 24 games over eight National
Football League seasons with the Washington Redskins, New York
Jets, Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions and Jacksonville Jaguars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
