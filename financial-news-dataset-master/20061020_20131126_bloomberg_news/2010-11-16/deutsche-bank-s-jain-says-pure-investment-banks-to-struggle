Deutsche Bank AG ’s head of
investment banking,  Anshu Jain , said he supports the purchase of
retail lender Deutsche Postbank AG to secure funding. Pure
investment banks will struggle to compete globally, he said.  “In today’s post-crisis world of constrained liquidity and
increased capital requirements, it is no longer possible to be a
global player of scale with a pure-play model,” Jain said in a
speech at a conference in Frankfurt today. “Banks without a
high-quality funding base will be at a competitive
disadvantage.”  “I share the enthusiasm” for the acquisition of Postbank,
he said.  Deutsche Bank offered to buy Bonn-based Postbank to boost
the number of retail clients to 24 million in Germany and lower
dependence on investment banking. Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  completed the company’s biggest share sale last month
to finance the takeover and increase reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
