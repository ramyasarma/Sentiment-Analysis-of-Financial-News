A Japanese government panel
abandoned a plan to separate Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp.’s fiber-optic operations into an independent company, the
Mainichi newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained
the information  The panel will this month release a report proposing that
the government leave NTT intact on grounds that a company
breakup would be too costly and increase the risk of technical
problems, the newspaper said.   Softbank Corp. President Masayoshi Son had called for the
NTT breakup to allow for more competition, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
