Novartis AG  hasn’t ruled out
operating  Alcon Inc . with its existing 77 percent stake as
minority investors seek an improved offer for the outstanding
shares, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer  Joe Jimenez .  “The intention is to have 100 percent,” Jimenez said,
according to the FT. “But Nestle owned 77 percent and the
company was run very successfully for many years, so we have not
ruled that out.”  The company’s strong cash flow means it will have paid off
the $50 billion it spent on buying Alcon in four years, Jimenez
said, which means Novartis could be in a position to seek
further acquisitions, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
