Greece led a surge in the cost of
insuring European government debt after Austria threatened to
block its next transfer of European Union funds because the
nation isn’t meeting tax revenue and deficit-cutting targets.  Credit-default swaps on Greece soared 86 basis points to
944, the highest since June 29, according to data provider CMA.
Contracts on Ireland rose 22 basis points to 515, Portugal
climbed 13 to 426, Italy increased 7 to 188 and Spain was up 8
at 259.  Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proell said Greece’s
progress in meeting its commitments “doesn’t give us any reason
to approve the December tranche.” The Greek budget deficit for
last year was revised to 15.4 percent of gross domestic product
from 13.6 percent by the EU yesterday, just six months after it
agreed a bailout with the EU and International Monetary Fund.  “It’s probably just political posturing, but it was enough
to cause a little panic,” said Peter Boockvar, a strategist
with Miller Tabak & Co. in New York.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments was 7 basis points higher at 168. A basis point on a
credit-default swap contract protecting $10 million of debt from
default for five years is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
