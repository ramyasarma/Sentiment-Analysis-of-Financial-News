The Australian dollar traded near a
more than two-week low after minutes of the central bank’s
meeting this month said its decision to raise interest rates was
“finely balanced” as consumers remain cautious.  The so-called Aussie declined against 15 of its 16 most-
traded counterparts as policy makers said a “modest
tightening” was considered prudent when they increased the
benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point on Nov. 2. New
Zealand’s currency failed to gain for a fourth day as European
officials urged Ireland to request aid to prevent a debt crisis.  “A December rate hike is off the table,” said  Roland Randall , a senior strategist at TD Securities Inc. in Singapore.
“The currency market hadn’t completely priced that in.”  Australia’s currency traded at 98.58 U.S. cents as of 12:15
p.m. in Sydney from 98.53 cents in New York yesterday when it
touched 98.13 cents, the least since Oct. 29. The currency was
at 81.84 yen from 81.85 yen. New Zealand’s dollar was unchanged
at 77.29 U.S. cents and 64.20 yen.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
