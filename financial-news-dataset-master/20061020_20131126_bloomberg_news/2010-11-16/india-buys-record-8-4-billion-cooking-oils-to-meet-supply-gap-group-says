Cooking oil imports by India, the
biggest consumer after China, climbed 7 percent to a record last
year as zero taxes and a growing population and incomes fuelled
demand for processed foods, a processors’ group said.  Purchases reached 9.24 million metric tons, valued at 380
billion rupees ($8.4 billion), in the year ended Oct. 31, from
8.66 million tons a year earlier, the  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Imports in October surged 25 percent from a year earlier to
832,699 tons, it said.  Increased purchases by India may help extend an 11-week
rally in futures on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the
benchmark price, and further cut global cooking oils stockpiles,
which are forecast by the U.S. government to drop by the most in
17 years. India overtook China last year as the world’s biggest
palm oil consumer.  “Imports are bound to rise in the years to come as local
oilseed production remains stagnant and the demand-supply gap
has to be met through only imports,” B.V. Mehta, executive
director at the processors group, said in a phone interview in
Mumbai. “India’s growing population needs an additional 1
million tons of edible oils every year.”  India relies on overseas supplies to meet more than half of
its edible oil demand and palm oil makes up almost 80 percent of
the nation’s purchases. The government scrapped a duty on crude
palm oil in 2008 and ended a 20 percent tax on crude soybean oil
in March 2009 to boost supplies and cool prices.  Vegetable oil stockpiles were at 1.45 million tons on Nov.
1, compared with 1.5 million tons a month earlier, as traders
slowed purchases after palm oil prices gained. January-delivery
futures today dropped 1.6 percent to 3,315 ringgit ($1,059) a
ton in Kuala Lumpur. Prices have rallied for 11 straight weeks,
the biggest winning streak since June 2007.  Imports of crude palm oil in the year ended Oct. 31 totaled
5.17 million tons, from 5.19 million tons a year earlier, while
soybean oil imports surged to 1.67 million tons from 989,613
tons a year ago, the association said.  India buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, the two
biggest producers, and soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
