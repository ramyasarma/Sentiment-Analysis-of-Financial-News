TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc, the U.K.
broadband provider split off from Carphone Warehouse Plc in
March, rose as much as 6.9 percent in London trading, on higher
sales and a fiber-network deal with BT Group Plc.  First-half revenue climbed 12 percent to 887 million pounds
($1.42 billion), the company said in a statement today. TalkTalk
agreed a deal with BT, the U.K.’s largest fixed-line phone
company, to offer high-speed fiber services, Chief Executive
Officer Dido Harding said in a phone interview.  The company will gain access to BT’s fiber-to-the-cabinet
service, she said, adding that “BT is rolling out fiber to the
cabinet much faster than fiber to the home.”  TalkTalk is seeking to offer more services to attract
subscribers to its bundled services. The company in July signed
an agreement with Vodafone Group Plc to offer a mobile-phone and
data service.  TalkTalk said earlier this year its Project Canvas joint
venture with BT will start by mid-2011. The venture will
build an open, Internet-connected television-on-demand platform
with common technical standards.  Shares of TalkTalk rose as much as 10 pence to 154.1 pence,
the biggest intraday gain  since May 28 , and were up 4.7 percent
at 150.9 pence as of 9:16 a.m.  The company won 52,000 additional broadband customers in
the first half, and said it will sign up a similar number in the
second half.  The company lowered its forecast for broadband net
additions to focus on transferring its customers to its own
network, Harding said today. The company said in May it aimed to
add a net 140,000 to 180,000 clients for the broadband service
in fiscal 2011.  The company is also targeting an additional 40 million
pounds to 50 million pounds of cost savings next year by
removing duplication, Harding said. “I have two or three of
almost everything,” she said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
