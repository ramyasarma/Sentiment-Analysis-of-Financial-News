Indianapolis  approved a 50-year
agreement with  Xerox Co.’s  Affiliated Computer Services to
manage and collect revenue from the city’s 3,600 parking meters.  The City Council approved the agreement, which will
generate $640 million over the life of the contract, by a 15-14
vote, Indianapolis said in a press  release  today.  “This proposal moves us in the right direction in bringing
our current parking system to its fullest potential,” council
member  Barbara Malone  said in the release.  The approval came after three months of debate that led to
the terms of the  proposal  to be modified to reduce the company’s
upfront payment to $20 million from $35 million and increase
payments to the city over the life of the contract to $620
million from $400 million. The city also added a clause that
gives it the opportunity to cancel the contract every 10 years.  Under the contract, Affiliated Computer, based in Dallas,
will upgrade the meters and other parts of the parking system.
The city, which has a population of about 785,000, intends to
use the proceeds to make street improvements around the meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
