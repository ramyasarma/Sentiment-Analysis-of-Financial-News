A court’s decision to void the
election of Phil Woolas, a former minister in Gordon Brown’s
Labour government, is damaging to free speech, the lawmaker’s
lawyers said in court today.  Woolas asked the High Court in London to overturn a ruling
earlier this month by a special election court declaring his
election to Parliament invalid. The election court ruled Woolas
knowingly published untrue information about his Liberal
Democrat opponent.  Voiding the election would “chill free speech at election
time,” Woolas’s lawyer Gavin Millar said at a hearing.  “In a democracy, the electors rather than judges should
decide what they think” of attacks made by candidates on their
opponents, Millar said.  Woolas, who won by 103 votes in the May 6 election, falsely
claimed that Elwyn Watkins had links to Muslim extremists and
lived outside the election district, two judges ruled Nov. 5. If
the judges who Woolas appealed to at today’s hearing reject his
case, it will force a new election in the northern English
constituency of Oldham and Saddleworth.  It was the first time in 99 years that an election has been
overturned as a result of a candidate making false statements.
On the same day as the court decision, Woolas, who was appointed
as a home office spokesman by Labour leader Ed Miliband last
month, was suspended from the party.  The case is: CO/11578/2010 The Queen on the application of
Woolas v Parliamentary Election Court For Oldham East And
Saddleworth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
