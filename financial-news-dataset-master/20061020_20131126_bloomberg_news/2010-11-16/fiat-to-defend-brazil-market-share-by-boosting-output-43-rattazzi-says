Fiat SpA’s  Argentine unit will ramp
up production as much as 43 percent next year in a bid to
counter declining market share in Brazil, its biggest market,
President  Cristiano Rattazzi  said.  “We need a lot more cars, we are losing market share in
Brazil for a lack of cars,” Rattazzi, 62, said in an interview
today in his offices overlooking the Rio de la Plata estuary in
Buenos Aires. “Brazil is the big market.”  Fiat Auto Argentina SA is investing 813 million pesos ($205
million) to build a  new model  it will sell in both Argentina and
Brazil beginning as early as March. Overall production at Fiat’s
plant in the province of Cordoba may reach 100,000 automobiles
in 2011, up from about 70,000 this year, Rattazzi said. About 85
percent of that output is for export to neighboring Brazil,
where the company was the second biggest seller, after
Volkswagen AG’s local unit, in October.  Brazil accounted for 17.6 percent of Fiat’s 50 billion
euros ($67.5 billion) in revenue in 2009, more than any country
in Europe except Italy, according to the Turin-based company’s
 financial results . Fiat owns 20 percent of Chrysler Group LLC.  The auto industry has been the “engine” of Argentina’s
 economic growth  since 2004, said Maximiliano Scarlan, an
economist at Abeceb.com research company in Buenos Aires. The
country’s economy may expand 9 percent this year, led by vehicle
production and a record 55-million metric ton soybean harvest,
according to the central bank. The economy grew 0.9 percent last
year.  Market Share  Brazil’s economy, the biggest in Latin America, will expand
7.6 percent this year and 4.5 percent in 2011, according to the
median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published today. Fiat accounted for 22 percent of the 228,175
vehicles sold in Brazil last month, down from 25 percent a year
earlier, according to the National Vehicle Manufacturer’s
Association in Sao Paulo.  Automakers represented about 57 percent of the growth of
Argentina’s industrial output this year, compared with 35
percent in 2006, Scarlan said. The country will likely produce
about 710,000 units this year, surpassing a record 590,000 in
2008, he said.  “There are expectations of reaching 800,000 units because
Brazil has a strong outlook of growth in the coming years, has a
domestic market with a new group of consumers and good
financing,” Scarlan said.  Inflation ‘Problem’  Rattazzi says Argentina’s government will need to take
measures to slow annual inflation he estimated at 25 percent to
30 percent, the fastest in the region after Venezuela.  The national statistics institute reported on Nov. 12 that
consumer prices rose 11.1 percent in October from a year
earlier, less than half the estimates by Rattazzi and other
private economists, including former central bank President and
current opposition lawmaker Alfonso Prat-Gay.  “When you have 30 percent inflation, you have a problem,”
Rattazzi said. “Coming out of inflation has never been easy but
it has to be done.”  Fiat shares on Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index fell 2
percent to 13.1 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
