Canada’s dollar slid to the lowest
level in more than two weeks as equities and commodities fell on
concern the global recovery is slowing, sapping demand for
assets related to economic growth.  The loonie was the second-biggest loser today against the
greenback after the krone of rival crude oil exporter Norway.
The Canadian dollar extended its drop after a government report
showed manufacturing sales decreased in September.  “The overall environment is still weak for risk assets,”
 Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote via e-mail. “Canadian
dollar strength or outperformance would be hard to justify in
such an environment.”  The Canadian currency depreciated 1.2 percent to C$1.0223
per U.S. dollar at 5:09 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0099
yesterday. It touched C$1.0254, the weakest level since Oct. 28.
One Canadian dollar buys 97.82 U.S. cents. The currency touched
levels stronger than parity Nov. 5-11.  The  MSCI World Index  of equities in developed nations
dropped for a seventh day, falling 1.9 percent in the longest
losing streak since January. Stocks slid on concern China will
take steps to curb inflation and as European finance officials
met to discuss Ireland’s debt turmoil. Futures on crude oil,
Canada’s biggest export, decreased as much as 3.3 percent to
$82.03 a barrel, the lowest level since Nov. 1.  ‘Rejection of Par’  “The Canadian dollar ranks as one of the weaker-performing
currencies,”  Shaun Osborne  and  Jacqui Douglas , currency
strategists at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in
Toronto, said in a research note to clients. The Canadian dollar
should decline versus the greenback “towards the low to mid
C$1.03 area at least as a consequence of spot’s latest rejection
of par,” they wrote.  Government securities rose, pushing the yield on the 10-
year bond down seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
3.07 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in
June 2020 climbed 60 cents to C$103.50. The  yield  increased
yesterday to 3.16 percent, the highest level since Aug. 5.  Canada’s factory sales fell 0.6 percent in September after
a 2 percent advance in the prior month, Statistics Canada
reported today in Ottawa. The median forecast of 20 economists
in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 0.9 percent decrease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
