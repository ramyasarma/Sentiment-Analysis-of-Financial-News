Mol Nyrt., Hungary’s largest
refiner, said third-quarter net income surged seven-fold, driven
by higher international hydrocarbon production, rising oil
prices  and a gain on financial transactions.  Third-quarter net profit jumped to 92.1 billion forint
($447 million) from 12.9 billion forint a year earlier, Mol said
in a statement posted on the website of the Budapest Stock
Exchange today. That compares with a projection of 89.4 billion
forint of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Operating profit in the exploration and production segment
rose to 81.3 billion forint from 35.1 billion forint in the
period due to higher production volumes in Syria and Croatian
off-shore projects and rising oil prices. Operating income in
the refining and marketing unit rose to 19.9 billion forint from
a loss of 1.7 billion forint.  Mol booked a profit of 41.3 billion forint on financial
transactions, compared with a profit of 19.9 billion forint a
year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
