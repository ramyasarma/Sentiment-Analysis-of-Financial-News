Burberry Group Plc , the U.K.’s
largest luxury retailer, reported first-half profit growth that
beat analysts’ estimates and raised its interim dividend as
shoppers bought more of its most expensive products.  Net income rose to 83.1 million pounds ($133 million) from
56.8 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based company
said today. The average  estimate  of five analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was 64.5 million pounds. The  dividend  for the six
months ended Sept. 30 increased 43 percent to 5 pence a share.  Burberry is adding more expensive goods, such as $4,995
aviator jackets, and offering fewer discounts as demand for
luxury items rebounds. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, PPR SA’s
Gucci Group and Hermes International SCA all reported stronger
sales or earnings in the past month, led by gains in Asia.  “This continues the positive series from luxury goods
companies,”  Luca Solca , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said
by e-mail. “Burberry is certainly moving in the right
direction.” He rates Burberry shares “market perform.”  Burberry rose 4 pence, or 0.4 percent, to 1,024 pence at
11:14 a.m. in London trading. The  shares  have risen 71 percent
this year, giving a market value of 4.46 billion pounds.  So-called adjusted pretax profit rose 49 percent to 128.5
million pounds, with exchange-rate shifts adding 5.7 million
pounds, Burberry said. The adjusted number excludes exceptional
items and losses tied to the closure of a factory in Spain as
well as other charges.  The company continues to forecast full-year adjusted pretax
profit of 240 million pounds to 270 million pounds, Chief
Financial Officer  Stacey Cartwright  said on a conference call.  Gross Margin  Burberry said 43 of the 50 franchised stores it acquired in
China transferred to the company on Sept. 1. The integration of
the Chinese operations is “on plan” and Burberry will invest
aggressively in the brand to improve retail productivity and
selectively open stores in targeted locations, the company said.  The first-half  gross margin  widened to 64.3 percent from
57.6 percent a year earlier. The company said it expects a
“modest” increase in gross margin in the second half as the
year-earlier comparisons become stronger.  Net cash was 180.9 million pounds as of Sept. 30, compared
with 56.3 million pounds a year earlier. Full-year capital
spending will be about 130 million pounds, almost double last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
