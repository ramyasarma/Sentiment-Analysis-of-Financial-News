Michael Vick  threw four touchdown
passes and ran for two more scores as the Philadelphia Eagles
beat the Washington Redskins 59-28 to tie the New York Giants
for first place in their National Football League division.  Vick and  DeSean Jackson  started the rout by hooking up for
an 88-yard touchdown pass on the Eagles’ first offensive play
last night at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.  Philadelphia scored a franchise-record 28 points in the
opening quarter and led the Redskins 35-0 when Vick tossed a 48-
yard touchdown pass to  Jeremy Maclin  on the first play of the
second quarter. Philadelphia was up 45-14 at halftime and
finished five points shy of its single-game scoring record set
in a 64-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds in 1934.  “I feel like I’m playing the best football only because of
the coaches I have, the guys I’m playing with,” Vick said at a
news conference. “I have a great group of guys around me so it
complements me.”  The Eagles improved to 6-3 and drew even atop the National
Football Conference’s Eastern Conference with the Giants, who
had a five-game winning streak snapped two days ago with a 33-20
loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles host the Giants Nov. 21.  “I’m proud of what we did, but we have to get ready for a
good Giants football team,” Eagles coach  Andy Reid  said at a
news conference.  Philadelphia piled up 592 yards of offense, beating the
previous team record of 583 set on Sept. 18, 2005, in a 42-3 win
over the San Francisco 49ers.  ‘I’m Embarrassed’  “We really got outplayed and outcoached in every area,”
Redskins coach  Mike Shanahan  said at a news conference. “I’m
embarrassed for our organization, our players (and) our football
team. Hopefully we’ll respond accordingly.”  Vick connected on 20 of 28 passes for 333 yards and has yet
to throw an interception this season.  He also ran for 80 yards on eight carries to pass Hall of
Famer Steve Young for the second-most rushing yards by a
quarterback in NFL history. Vick has 4,295 yards and trails only
former Eagles quarterback  Randall Cunningham  (4,928).  Philadelphia rolled up 425 offensive yards by halftime as
Vick led touchdown drives on the Eagles’ first five possessions.
The Eagles came within four points of the NFL record of 49
first-half points set by the 1983 Green Bay Packers in a 55-14
win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Vick threw his fourth touchdown pass of the game with 6:26
left in the third quarter, connecting with  Jason Avant  from
three yards out to give the Eagles a 52-21 lead.  Dimitri Patterson  had a 40-yard interception return for
Philadelphia less than one minute later.  McNabb Interceptions  It was one of three interceptions thrown by Redskins
quarterback  Donovan McNabb , who received a contract extension
yesterday that’s worth $78 million over five years, according to
ESPN.  “We dug ourselves a deep hole that we couldn’t get out
of,” McNabb said. “At some point of the year, you have a gut
check and this would probably be it.”  Rookie running back  Keiland Williams  scored three
touchdowns for the Redskins, who gave up the most points since
they lost 62-3 to the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 7, 1954. The
Redskins allowed the most points in NFL history in losing the
1940 NFL championship game 73-0 to the Chicago Bears.  The Eagles finished with the most points scored by one team
in the 40-year history of “Monday Night Football.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
