Mexico’s lower house of Congress
approved the 2011 budget today with a smaller deficit and a
spending increase of 8.2 percent in nominal terms compared with
this year.  The lower house voted 454 to 13 in favor of the spending
portion of the budget, which calls for 3.44 trillion pesos ($280
billion) in outlays. Lawmakers modified the total spending of
3.35 trillion pesos proposed by President  Felipe Calderon  on
Sept. 8.  The bill, which now goes to Calderon for signing, shifts
98.6 billion pesos of spending, Luis Videgaray, head of the
budget committee and member of the  Institutional Revolutionary
Party , or PRI, told reporters earlier today.  Roberto Gil, also a member of the lower house budget
committee from the National Action Party, or PAN, said in an
interview that the reallocations from the president’s original
proposal go mainly to the agriculture and infrastructure
sectors.  The funds were taken mostly from cuts in government
operating expenses, deficit increases, a higher oil price and
taxes on cigarettes and energy drinks such as those sold by Red
Bull GmbH.  The Congress last month approved the income portion of the
budget with an estimated oil price of $65.40 per barrel and a
deficit equal to 0.5 percent of gross domestic product,
excluding debt from state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos,
or Pemex. Mexico’s 2010 budget calls for a deficit of 0.7
percent of GDP.  Rebounding Economy  The budget approval comes as Mexico’s economy is rebounding
from its worst slump since 1932 on the back of export growth.
The government allayed concerns about the strength of public
finances by approving a wider deficit and tax hikes last year.  The budget plan approved by the lawmakers doesn’t include a
reduction in the country’s value-added tax, which had been
sought by the Institutional Revolutionary Party and opposed by
Calderon.  Mexican exports, buoyed by a 44 percent rise in auto sales
abroad, climbed 21 percent in September from a year earlier. The
central bank forecasts the economy will grow 5 percent this year
and 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent in 2011. The economy contracted
6.5 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
