Mubadala Development Co., an
investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, confirmed it is in
talks to complete the transfer of its 5 percent stake in sports-
car maker  Ferrari SpA  to  Fiat SpA .  Fiat “exercised a call option” to buy back the stake
acquired in 2005, a Mubadala official, who declined to be
identified in line with company policy, said in response to e-
mailed questions. “We are currently in discussions to complete
the transaction.”  Fiat paid 122 million euros ($165.7 million) to exercise an
option to buy back the 5 percent stake from Mubadala, according
to an interim report distributed by the Italian exchange on Oct.
22. It takes Fiat’s holding in Ferrari to 90 percent.  Fiat may sell its auto-parts division Magneti Marelli SpA
and a stake in Ferrari before consolidating Chrysler Group LLC,
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  told analysts Nov. 12.  Mubadala bought 5 percent of Ferrari from Mediobanca SpA in
2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
