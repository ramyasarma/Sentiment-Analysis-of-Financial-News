Russia’s central bank and the
Finance Ministry proposed increasing the minimum capital
requirement for banks to between 250 million rubles and 500
million rubles, which may reduce the number of lenders by more
than a third, Kommersant reported, citing a government policy
document.  The new rules, which will be discussed at the upper house of
Russia’s parliament on Nov. 25, may go into effect starting in
2015, the newspaper said.        The minimum capital level is already scheduled to rise to 180
million rubles on Jan. 1, 2012, from 90 million rubles
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
