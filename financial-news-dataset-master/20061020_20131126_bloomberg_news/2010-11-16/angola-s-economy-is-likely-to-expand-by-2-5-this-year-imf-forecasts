Angola’s economy will expand 2.5
percent this year, less than forecast by the government, as oil
production slips and the government cuts back on spending, the
International Monetary Fund said.  Growth in Africa’s second-biggest crude producer “has been
adversely affected by temporary production problems in the oil
sector and by fiscal retrenchment,” IMF said in a  statement  on
its website dated yesterday. “A solid pick-up in the pace of
growth is expected for 2011 as these temporary effects unwind.”  On Oct. 15, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos forecast
economic growth at 4.5 percent this year and 8 percent in 2011.
Two months earlier, the Finance Ministry cut its estimate to
between 5 percent and 6 percent from 6.7 percent, and from the
9.7 percent forecast earlier in the year.  The IMF mission was in Angola’s capital, Luanda, from Nov.
1 to 11 to conduct the fourth review of its $1.4 billion loan
program with the southern African nation.  “Implementation of the government’s stabilization and
reform program has been broadly as envisaged,” mission chief
 Sean Nolan  said. “Budgetary outlays have been tightly contained
to date, making room for building foreign reserves and paying
off outstanding liabilities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
