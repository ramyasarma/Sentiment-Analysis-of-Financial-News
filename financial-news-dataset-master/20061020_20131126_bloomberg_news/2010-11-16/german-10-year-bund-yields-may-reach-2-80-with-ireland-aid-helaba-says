German bonds may fall, potentially
sending the 10-year yield toward 2.80 percent, should today’s
meeting of euro finance ministers provide details about a rescue
for Ireland, Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said.  “The differential between 10-year Irish bonds and their
German counterparts has narrowed,”  Ulrich Wortberg , a fixed-
income strategist in Frankfurt wrote in a note to clients today.
“Periphery spreads should continue to tighten if the question
of European Union aid for Ireland is clarified. German
government bonds would come under further pressure. A lasting
rise in the yield above 2.60 percent would create significant
upside potential.”  German bonds declined, sending the 10-year  bund yield  two
basis points higher to 2.59 percent, as of 7:57 a.m. in London
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
