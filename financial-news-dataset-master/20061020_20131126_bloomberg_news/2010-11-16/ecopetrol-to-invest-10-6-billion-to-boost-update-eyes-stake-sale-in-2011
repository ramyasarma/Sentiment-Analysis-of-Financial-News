Ecopetrol SA, Colombia’s largest oil
company, said it plans to invest $10.6 billion in 2011 as it
seeks to almost double production over the next decade.  The Bogota-based  company  may spend more if it makes
acquisitions, it said today in a statement.  Ecopetrol is exploring for oil across Colombia, and in
Peru, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it spends more than
$80 billion through 2020 to almost double output from last year.
To fund investment, Ecopetrol may sell a 9.9 percent equity
stake, sell bonds abroad or in Colombia, borrow from banks or
sell stakes in non-strategic assets, the company has said.  The company will likely sell a stake in itself in 2011’s
first half, Energy and Mines Minister  Carlos Rodado  said today
in a broadcast on the country’s presidential website.  Next year’s production will rise to an average of 750,000
barrels per day of oil and natural gas, including units outside
of Colombia, the company said. In 2020, Ecopetrol plans to pump
1.3 million barrels of oil a day.  Ecopetrol slid 145 pesos, or 3.5 percent, to 4,000 pesos at
10:44 a.m. in Bogota, as oil prices declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
