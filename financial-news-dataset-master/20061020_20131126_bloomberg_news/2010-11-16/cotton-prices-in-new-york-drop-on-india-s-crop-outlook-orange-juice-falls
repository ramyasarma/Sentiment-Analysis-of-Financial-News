Cotton prices in New York fell by
the exchange limit for the second time in three sessions on
signs of rising production in India, the world’s second-biggest
grower. Orange juice also dropped.  The Cotton Association of India said today that output may
be 35.7 million bales in the year that began Oct. 1. That’s more
than the group’s September forecast of 34.45 million and 32.55
million projected by the nation’s Cotton Advisory Board. Futures
in New York have surged 71 percent this year, touching the
highest price ever last week, as shrinking global supplies
trailed increasing demand.  “The debate is whether it’s going to be a big crop or a
really, really big crop,” said  Gary Raines , an economist at
FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. “India has
grown more cotton than they’ve used for a good number of
years.”  Cotton futures for March delivery fell the exchange maximum
of 5 cents, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $1.292 a pound at 2:38
p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The commodity dropped 12
percent in the past week, after reaching a record $1.5195 on
Nov. 10.  Earlier, the price climbed as much as 3 percent.  “I see rampant volatility remaining the rule of the day,”
Raines said.  A bigger crop in India may help ease restrictions on
exports that were limited to 5.5 million bales earlier this
year. That limit may be reviewed in December, Farm Minister
 Sharad Pawar  said in October. A bale in India weighs 375 pounds,
or 170 kilograms.  Inventories Surge  U.S. inventories  monitored by ICE almost doubled last week
to 37,086 bales, each weighing 480 pounds. They gained 3 percent
yesterday to 38,244 bales. Stockpiles plunged as low as 8,910
bales on Oct. 8, down 99 percent from this year’s high of 1.08
million on June 2.  As of Nov. 14, 78 percent of the U.S. crop was  harvested ,
according to the USDA.  The U.S. is the leading cotton exporter and third-biggest
grower. China is the largest producer.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 4.85 cents,
or 3.1 percent, to settle at $1.5265 a pound at 2 p.m. in New
York, the biggest decline since Oct. 14. The price has climbed
18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
