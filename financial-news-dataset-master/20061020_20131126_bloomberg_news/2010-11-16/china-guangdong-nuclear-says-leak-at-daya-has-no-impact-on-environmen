China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co. said the radiation leak at its Daya Bay plant in the
southern province of Guangdong won’t have an impact on the
environment or the health of workers, the state-owned company
said in a statement on its website today.  The No. 1 reactor, where the leak was detected on Oct. 23,
had been shut since Oct. 22 for scheduled maintenance, the
company said.   The leak was caused by a fault in a pipeline removing heat
from the reactor, China Guangdong Nuclear said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
