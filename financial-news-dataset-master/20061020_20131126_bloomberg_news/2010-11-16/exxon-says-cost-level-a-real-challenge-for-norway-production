Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s
largest company by market value, and ConocoPhillips said
drilling costs in Norway need to be reduced to improve recovery
from aging oil fields.  Costs are “a real challenge” for oil and gas production
in Norway, Jan Aage Hansen at Exxon in Norway, said today in a
presentation in Oslo to Oil Minister Terje Riis-Johansen as part
of hearings on how to raise recovery from dwindling deposits.  Hansen and Steinar Vaage, head of ConocoPhillips in Norway,
called for greater mobility of rigs between Norway and the U.K.
to lower costs and improve availability. Norway’s regulatory
requirements for rigs differ from those in the U.K.  “What’s important is that we open up the market,” Vaage
said at the meeting. “This opening of the market would be very
important to get access to rigs that are more cost effective and
reduce costs.”  The government has urged producers such as state-controlled
Statoil ASA and ConocoPhillips to improve recovery from the
country’s deposits. Output in the world’s seventh-biggest oil
exporter has almost fallen more than 40 percent in the past
decade after 40 years of pumping from fields such as Ekofisk,
Oseberg and Troll.  Costs for the oil industry in Norway are forecast to climb
3 percent to 4 percent annually in the coming years, after
surging 80 percent from 2004 to 2008, Bjoern Harald Martinsen,
an economist at the Norwegian Oil Industry Association, said in
an interview last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
