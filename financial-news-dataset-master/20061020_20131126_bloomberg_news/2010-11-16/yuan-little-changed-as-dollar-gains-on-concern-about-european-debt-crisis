China’s yuan was little changed
against the dollar, following two days of declines, as investors
sought safer assets on concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
worsen.  China’s central bank set its daily reference rate weaker
for a second day, at 6.6441 per dollar, after European officials
urged Ireland to tap a 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) fund to
help contain the country’s fiscal problems. Central Bank
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in Beijing today China will
continue to reform the yuan’s exchange-rate mechanism.  The fixing moved "in sympathy with the dollar on
risk aversion because of what’s happening in Europe and the
U.S.,’’ said Claudio Piron, head of emerging Asia foreign
exchange and fixed-income strategy at Bank of America in
Singapore.  The yuan traded at 6.6423 per dollar as of 10:20 a.m. in
Shanghai, from 6.6455 yesterday, after weakening 0.3 percent in
the previous two days, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4945 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 2.4 percent in a year. Investors pared bets on yuan
gains in the past two days after China deflected U.S. criticism
of its currency policy at a Group of 20 summit last week, saying
money-printing by the Federal Reserve may destabilize the global
financial system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
