Brazil’s central bank will raise its
overnight rate more than previously forecast in 2011 as
inflation in Latin America’s biggest economy remains above the
midpoint of its target range, according a weekly central bank
survey.  Economists in the survey said the bank will raise the Selic
to 12 percent by the end of next year, up from a week-earlier
forecast of 11.75 percent. Prices will rise 5.48 percent this
year and 5.05 percent in 2011, both up from forecasts of 5.31
percent and 4.99 percent, respectively. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  The forecasts contrast with statements by Finance Minister
Guido Mantega, who said in a Nov. 13 interview that “the
central bank can cut in 2011,” after President-elect Dilma
Rousseff takes office and restrains spending. Policy makers held
the rate at 10.75 percent at their last two meetings after
raising it 200 basis points this year from a record low 8.75
percent.  Analysts revised their inflation and interest rate
forecasts higher after consumer prices rose more than forecast
in October, said  Maristella Ansanelli , chief economist at Banco
Fibra SA.  “There are two big forces,” Ansanelli said, speaking by
telephone from Sao Paulo. “On the one side commodities prices
on international markets. On the other side you have demand in
Brazil increasing very fast.”  The yield on interest rate futures contracts due in January
2012, the most traded today, rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 11.57 percent at 6:50 a.m. New York
time. The real fell 0.6 percent to 1.7322 per dollar.  Adding Pressure  Brazilian consumer prices rose more than forecast in
October, pushing inflation to an eight-month high and adding
pressure on the central bank to resume interest-rate increases.
The IPCA consumer price index rose 0.75 percent in October, its
fastest increase since February, taking the annual inflation
rate to 5.20 percent.  The survey showed analysts expect policy makers to raise
the Selic to 12 percent by September after increases in April
and June.  Brazil’s industrial production contracted 0.2 percent in
September, the fifth monthly decline since April, the national
statistics agency said Nov. 4. Output rose 6.3 percent from a
year ago, the slowest annual pace this year and below analysts’
median forecast for a 7.1 percent increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
