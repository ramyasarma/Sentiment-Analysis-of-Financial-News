Copper resumed a decline in London
and New York on concern that China, the world’s biggest metals
consumer, may take further steps to cool price gains, damping
demand for commodities. Zinc, lead and tin fell.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange dropped as much as 1.6 percent to $8,510 a metric ton,
and traded at $8,540 a ton at 3:51 p.m. Singapore time. The
metal gained 0.4 percent yesterday as retail sales in the U.S.,
the second-largest user, climbed the most in seven months.  “The macroeconomic outlook continues to weigh on investor
sentiment, especially what additional measures the Chinese
government will take to cool the economy,” Wu Yuanfeng, an
analyst at New Century Futures Co., said from Zhejiang.  March-delivery copper on the Comex in New York fell as much
as 1.2 percent to $3.8760 a pound, while futures in Shanghai
lost as much as 1.2 percent to 64,160 yuan ($9,655) a ton before
ending the day at 64,310 yuan.  China will introduce measures to control rising food prices,
including subsidies and limits on how much products may be sold
for, the China Securities Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person. The government will also increase
punishment for speculators in cotton and corn, it said.  The country will raise interest rates “very soon” to
tackle inflation,  Andy Xie , an independent economist, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Hong Kong.  Chile Stoppage  Workers at  Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc ’s Collahuasi
copper mine in northern Chile will lower their wage demands in
government-mediated talks to end an 11-day strike if the company
increases its proposal, union leader Manuel Munoz said in an
interview with Bloomberg News yesterday.  “Today’s U.S. industrial production figures for October
will provide the next trading impetus,”  Stefan Graber , an
analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note today. “We
would argue that medium-term fundamentals continue to point
toward firming demand conditions.”  Industrial production in the U.S., the world’s second-
largest copper consumer, probably expanded in October,
rebounding from the first decrease in more than a year and
signaling manufacturing continues to support the economic
recovery, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 78 economists.  China Sells  China will auction 117,000 tons of aluminum from state
reserves from Nov. 23 to Nov. 24, the National Development and
Reform Commission said on its website today. This is the second
time the State Reserve Bureau is selling aluminum stockpiles.  The government sold about 96,000 tons of aluminum on Nov. 1
and Nov. 2, about 50,000 tons of zinc on Nov. 9 and held a
public auction for 34,500 tons of lead today, even as curbs on
energy cut metals production in the country.  Power reductions in China could have tightened the market
instead of selling stockpiles,  Peter Richardson , chief metals
economist at Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd., said in a Nov. 9
interview with Bloomberg News. “It tells me they’re worried
about the unintended price consequences of this strategy.”  Zinc and lead in London tumbled for a third day. Zinc
dropped 2.4 percent to $2,281 a ton and lead declined 1.4
percent to $2,420 a ton. Aluminum lost 0.8 percent to $2,382 a
ton, tin shed 1.2 percent to $25,600 a ton, while nickel slipped
0.5 percent to $22,250 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
