Leon Christophilopoulos, head of
gasoline trading at Vitol Group, has left his position in
London, the company said.  He left last week, two people with knowledge of the
situation said, declining to be named because they are not
authorized to speak about the matter. They didn’t say where he
had moved to. A London-based official at Vitol, who also
declined to be identified by name, confirmed the departure
without saying when Christophilopoulos left or why.  Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil-trading company,
trades about 1 million barrels of gasoline a day globally,
according to the company’s  website .  Christophilopoulos previously worked as a senior gasoline
trader in London for Trafigura Beheer BV, the Amsterdam-based
commodities trader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
