Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  won’t
increase customer discounts as the race to be 2010’s top-selling
U.S. luxury automobile brand goes into the final weeks of the
year.  “We’re chasing profit more than we’re chasing volume,”
said Peter Miles, executive vice president of operations for
BMW’s North American unit. He spoke in an interview today in
advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show, which opens to the press
tomorrow.  Toyota Motor Corp.’s  Lexus, helped by customer discounts,
earned the top-selling luxury spot in October, the first time
since May, to help widen its lead for the year. The Toyota City,
Japan-based company’s luxury brand is under pressure to keep the
lead after Toyota’s record recalls this year and new products
from competitors BMW and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz division.  The average cost of incentives on Lexus cars rose to $3,746
in October from $1,121 a year earlier, while incentive spending
on Lexus trucks rose to $2,810 from $696, according to Autodata
Corp., a Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based researcher.  BMW lowered its incentive spending by 39 percent last month
to an average of $2,926, while Mercedes was relatively flat with
a decline of 3 percent to $3,879, Autodata said. BMW’s incentive
spending declined 27 percent for the year through October and
Mercedes dropped 30 percent.  Subsidizing Leases  BMW traditionally spends most of its incentive money on
subsidizing leases, said  Jesse Toprak , vice president of
industry trends at TrueCar.com, a researcher that follows
automobile sales and marketing.  “This year, because of the recovery in the leasing
markets, BMW actually was able to control their incentives while
still being able to offer attractive lease programs,” he said.  While the same improved leasing conditions apply to Lexus
and Mercedes, those automakers are spending on incentives as
they go for the No. 1 selling spot, he said.  U.S. sales for this year through October totaled 183,529
for Lexus, 178,080 for Mercedes and 176,736 for BMW, the global
leader in luxury-vehicle deliveries.  The totals don’t include non-luxury models such as BMW’s
Mini cars or Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s Smart cars and
Sprinter vans.  BMW’s November and December incentive spending should be in
line with October, Miles said, without providing details.  The company’s U.S. sales will increase 16 percent next year
on growth from new products such as the redesigned X3 sport-
utility vehicle, the 5-Series and the new 6-Series, Miles said.  “We’re fueling our growth now with new products,” he
said.  The race for the No. 1 spot should continue to be close
next year, analysts said.  “I think we will see a photo finish” of the 2011 selling
year, Toprak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
