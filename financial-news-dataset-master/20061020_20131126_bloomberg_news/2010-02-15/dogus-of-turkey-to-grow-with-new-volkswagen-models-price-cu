             Dogus Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS ,
the biggest retailer of  Volkswagen AG  vehicles in Turkey, will
increase its market share to as much as 11 percent this year
with new models and price cuts, even as the market shrinks.  
 Dogus cut prices of light commercial vehicles by 10 percent
at the start of the year to help regain an overall loss in
market share in 2009 of 1.6 percentage points to 9 percent,
chairman  Aclan Acar  said in an interview in Istanbul today.  
 Turkey’s passenger and light commercial vehicle market may
contract 6 percent to 525,000 units in 2010 in the absence of
government incentives, Acar said. Manufacturers sold a total of
557,000 units in 2009, according to data on the Web site of the
country’s  Automotive Distributors’ Association .  
 Dogus will introduce new passenger and light vehicle models
such as the Audi A1 and VW Amarok, Caddy, Transporter and Polo,
Acar said. Some existing models with more powerful turbo-charged
FSI engines will be sold in Turkey this year, he said.
