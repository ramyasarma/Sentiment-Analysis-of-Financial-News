             Cell Genesys Inc., the developer of
an immune-system booster that was being tested against prostate
cancer, halted the study after more people died on combination
therapy that included the drug.  
 In the trial of 408 patients with advanced prostate cancer,
67 taking Cell Genesys' GVAX in combination with another
medicine Taxotere died, compared with 47 who died taking the
other medicine alone, the South San Francisco, California-based
company in a statement distributed by Business Wire. The reason
for the death imbalance isn't known, the company said.  
 Cell Genesys had expected to enroll 1,200 people in a study
of whether GVAX can help prostate-cancer patients live longer.
The company hoped its drug would the first immune-boosting
treatment against cancer. People already enrolled in the study
will stop taking GVAX, the company said, and no one else will be
asked to participate.  
 ``Notwithstanding this discouraging outcome, we would like
to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and
physicians who have participated in this trial,'' said Chief
Executive Officer Stephen A. Sherwin in the statement.  
 Cell Genesys has no products for sale and had an
accumulated  deficit  of $491 million at the end of 2007, the
company said in a regulatory filing. Sherwin said the company
had $166 million in cash as of June 30, according to today's
statement.
