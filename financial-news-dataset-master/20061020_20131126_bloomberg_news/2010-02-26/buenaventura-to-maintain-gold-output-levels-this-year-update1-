             Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA ’s
gold production from its wholly owned mines will be little
changed this year as a new mine helps make up for declines at
older deposits, Chief Executive Officer Roque Benavides said.  
 Peru’s largest locally owned gold miner will produce
430,000 ounces this year, up 1 percent from 2009, Benavides said
today in a conference call with analysts. Silver output will
rise 5 percent to 15.5 million ounces and zinc output will rise
83 percent to 75,000 metric tons.  
 “Output will be in line with 2009,” he said. “We don’t
expect a substantial increase.”  
 The company will start producing 100,000 ounces of gold a
year at its La Zanja mine in July, Benavides said.  
 Buenaventura plans to tap 2009 profit, which more than
doubled to $593.6 million because of surging prices, to prepay
$205 million in debt on March 1, he said. Buenaventura in May
2008 took out a $450 million, five-year loan to buy back future
gold-production commitments, known as hedges.  
 Buenaventura’s  American depositary receipts , each
representing one ordinary share, rose for a third day, gaining
57 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $33.38 at 12:06 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading.
