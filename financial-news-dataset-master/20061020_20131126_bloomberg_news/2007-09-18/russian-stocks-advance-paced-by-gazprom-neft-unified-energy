             Russian stocks gained for the first
time in three days, led by OAO Gazprom Neft, OAO Unified Energy
System and OAO Lukoil.  
 The ruble-denominated  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 0.5 percent to
1657.11 at 11:22 a.m. in Moscow as 23 stocks rose, four declined
and three were unchanged. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added
0.3 percent to 1,920.79.  
 Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of natural-gas producer OAO
Gazprom climbed 2.2 percent to 98 rubles on the Micex Stock
Exchange. Unified Energy, the national power utility, advanced
1.2 percent to 29.94 rubles. Lukoil, Russia's largest independent
crude producer, rose 0.6 percent to 1,918.60 rubles.  
 Crude oil for October delivery gained as much 67 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $81.24 a barrel and was trading at $81.18 in
after-hours electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on speculation that rising demand will deplete
stockpiles during the Northern Hemisphere winter.  
 Russian markets will probably see ``slight price movements''
before the U.S. Federal Reserve makes a decision on interest rates,
``although a record high for crude oil should attract some support
to the oil majors,''  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib
Financial Corp., wrote in a report to investors this morning.  
 The Fed will probably cut its benchmark interest rate today
for the first time in four years, seeking insurance against a
recession in the world's largest economy.  
 OAO Aeroflot, eastern  Europe 's biggest airline, rose 1.2
percent to 72.64 rubles.
