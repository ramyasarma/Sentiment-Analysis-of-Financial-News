             A fire engulfed a hotel in the
northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniyah, leaving 29 people dead and
21 injured, the news  website  of President  Jalal Talabani ’s
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said.  
 The fire broke out at the five-story Soma Hotel yesterday
at 10:30 p.m. local time after an electrical short circuit,
according to the website, which cited an unidentified security
official. It took seven hours to bring it under control.  
 Four children and seven women were among those killed, the
PUK said, citing Hawa Hassan, a director of emergency services.  
 Police Brigadier General Najim-al-Din Qadir was cited by
the Associated Press as saying the dead include a Canadian and
people from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ecuador, Venezuela and China.
Some of them worked for foreign oil companies, AP reported.  
 Sulaimaniyah is 270 kilometers (170 miles) from Baghdad in
Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan. Kurdish officials are seeking
investment in the region, and say its oil reserves may be as
much as 45 billion barrels and that the area has 3 trillion to 6
trillion cubic meters of natural gas.
