             Inflation in China will start to
moderate after October and the consumer price index is likely to
fluctuate around 3 percent in the second half of the year, the
National Development and Reform Commission said.  
 Imported inflation is easing and Chinese people’s
inflationary expectations have eased notably, the planning
commission said in a statement on its website today.
