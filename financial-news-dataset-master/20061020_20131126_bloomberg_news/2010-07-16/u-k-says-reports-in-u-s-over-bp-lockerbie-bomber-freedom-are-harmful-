             The British ambassador to the U.S.,
Nigel Sheinwald, said “inaccuracies” in reports about links
between BP Plc and the release last year of Lockerbie bomber
Abdelbasset Al-Megrahi were “harmful to the U.K.”  
 “I am troubled by the claims made in the press that
Megrahi was released because of an oil deal involving BP, and
that the medical evidence supporting his release was paid for by
the Libyan government.” Sheinwald wrote yesterday in a letter
to Senator John F. Kerry, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations. “Both of these allegations are untrue.”
