             Typhoon Conson made landfall on
China’s Hainan island, lashing the coast with heavy rain and
strong winds, the China Meteorological Administration said.  
 Conson, which left 38 people dead earlier this week as it
battered the Philippines, reached land at Sanya on Hainan at
7:50 p.m. Beijing time, the center  said  on its website and was
moving in a northwesterly direction. The city recalled to port
all fishing boats and almost 40,000 people across the island
had been relocated by 4:30 p.m., according to the official
Xinhua News Agency.  
 Most of Hainan and coastal regions of China’s Guangdong
province as well as southeast Guangxi will have strong winds
and heavy rains that may last until July 19, the agency said.  
 Conson’s winds are forecast to weaken to 120 kph as it
passes over Hainan tonight. The storm is expected to further
weaken into a tropical storm before making landfall southeast
of Hanoi in Vietnam tomorrow. In the Philippines, 47 people
remain missing and about 8,900 people in evacuation centers
after Conson hit the country’s most populous island of Luzon,
the National Disaster Coordinating Council  said .  
 Ten fishing vessels were overturned by Conson when it
passed near the Xisha or Paracel Islands, Xinhua said.  
 Conson is a mountain region in Vietnam, according to the
Hong Kong Observatory, which lists  names  assigned to cyclones
in the Pacific.
