             The secured lenders to Brown
Publishing Co., the publisher of Dan’s Papers in New York’s
Hamptons, will be allowed to bid for its assets using what the
company owes them instead of cash, a federal bankruptcy judge in
Central Islip, New York, ruled today, overturning an
objection from the committee of unsecured creditors.
