             Deutsche Bank AG  will close a three-
person operation in Japan after a probe of erroneous sell orders
made in June that caused the Nikkei 225 Stock Average to plunge.  
 Deutsche Bank announced the results of the investigation
today in a  statement  on its website. The bank will continue to
trade in Japan through other departments and closure of the
Asian Quantitative Trading department in Japan will not affect
clients, said  Seiko Adachi , a Tokyo-based spokeswoman.  
 Automated sell orders for Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
futures contracts sent the index into a brief dive on June 1
seconds after trading opened at 9 a.m. The orders were sent
after changes to an automated trading system resulted in  market
data being misread, the bank said in the statement.    Deutsche
Bank said it has since stopped using the automated trading
system in Japan.  
 The company “is reviewing the processes and governance of
systems development, operations, upgrades and maintenance,”
David Hatt, president of the local securities unit, said in the
statement.  
 About 180 sell orders, amounting to about 16 trillion yen
($183 billion), were placed repeatedly at the start of trading
 Michio Yoneda , president of Osaka Stock Exchange, said on June
22. About 50 billion yen of those orders were executed and the
transactions were canceled after the exchange contacted the
bank, he said.  
 Deutsche Bank  fell  as much as 2 percent to 48.20 euros in
Frankfurt trading and was 1.2 percent lower at 48.60 euros as of
2:33 p.m. local time. The stock is down 1.7 percent this year.
