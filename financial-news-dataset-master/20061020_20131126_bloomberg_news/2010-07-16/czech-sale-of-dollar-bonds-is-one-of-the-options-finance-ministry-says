             The Czech Republic is considering a
sale of bonds in U.S. dollars this year as one of the possible
ways to fund its budget deficit and repay older debt, the
Finance Ministry said today.  
 “Dollar bonds are one of the options we obviously have to
explore, along with other options,” Jakub Haas, a spokesman for
the ministry, said in response to e-mailed questions.  
 The country delayed a planned sale of at least 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) of debt until market activity picks up
after the July and August holidays, a banker involved in the
deal said July 12. The government is planning as much as $2
billion of dollar bonds to diversify from koruna and euro debt,
Mlada Fronta Dnes newspaper reported June 15, citing  Eduard Janota , whose term as finance minister ended this week.  
 “We will neither confirm nor deny this information,” Haas
said today when asked about the newspaper report.  
 Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank AG and Ceska Sporitelna AS
were hired in February for the sale of foreign bonds, which was
delayed in April as borrowing costs surged on concern Europe’s
debt crisis would spread. The country plans to borrow a record
280 billion koruna ($14.3 billion) in 2010 to cover a planned
deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product and repay debt.
