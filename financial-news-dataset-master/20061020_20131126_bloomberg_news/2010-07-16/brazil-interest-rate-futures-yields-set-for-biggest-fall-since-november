             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell, headed to the  biggest weekly drop  since
November, as inflation was less than forecast, reducing pressure
on the central bank to increase interest rates.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 11.10 percent at 10:29 a.m. New York time. The yield
has declined 22 basis points this week, the  biggest drop  since
the period ended Nov. 6.  
 The Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation’s IGP-10
 inflation index , which monitors prices from the 11th of the
previous month to the 10th of the current month, was 0.05
percent in July, less than the 0.31 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 20 economists.  
 “The inflation watch in general has started to tame a
little bit, and today’s data only reinforces that,” said
 Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IDEAglobal in New York.  
 A report this week showed Chinese industrial output rose
13.7 percent in June, less than the 15.1 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. China is Brazil’s biggest trading
partner.  
 “By no means are we seeing any significant risk that
growth is grinding to a halt, but a more fragile global outlook
in the U.S. and China is channeling into a less hawkish view of
Brazil rates,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Plc in New York.  
 The real weakened 0.8 percent to 1.7772 per dollar, from
1.7629 yesterday. The currency has dropped 1.2 percent this
week.
