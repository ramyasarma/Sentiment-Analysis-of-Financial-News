             Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  says he knows how important it is to contain the nation’s
growing  debt  load, drawing from first-hand experience of being a
borrower himself.  
 “Japan’s in a severe fiscal situation -- and I can say the
same applies for my finances,” Noda, who disclosed he has a 36
million yen ($413,000) bank loan, said at a press conference in
Tokyo today. “I need a fiscal strategy for my household budget
and will return the money according to a schedule.”  
 Noda last month helped Prime Minister Naoto Kan craft
guidelines for cutting the government’s debt burden, which at
$80,000 per head is twice the annual salary of the country’s
average worker. The government last month pledged to balance its
primary budget by fiscal 2020 while freezing spending increases
and new bond sales for three years.  
 “If your own finances are severe, it may be easier to
understand the threat of debt problems because one can frame
them in the context of a household budget,” said  Toshihiro Nagahama , chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in
Tokyo. “Noda will work hard to address Japan’s fiscal
problem.”  
 Noda disclosed his finances in accordance with Cabinet
rules and the documents didn’t elaborate on the nature of his
debt. He and his wife have 17.7 million yen in assets and Noda
doesn’t hold any bonds and stocks, the report showed.
