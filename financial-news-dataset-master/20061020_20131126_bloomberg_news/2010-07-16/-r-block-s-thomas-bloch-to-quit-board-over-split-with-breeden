             H&R Block Inc. director Thomas
Bloch, a member of the family that built the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, said he won’t seek re-election because of
disagreements with Chairman Richard Breeden and “the intense
pressure from short-term oriented shareholders.”  
 Bloch said in a letter to the board filed with regulators
today that he opposed a 2008 stock buyback as “ill-timed,”
that the 2010 fiscal plan was “overly optimistic” and that the
company missed its earnings guidance. He cited “fundamental”
disagreements with Breeden, a hedge-fund manager, and said the
company was “overly generous” with compensation for Chief
Executive Officer Alan Bennett.  
 “My father Henry Bloch, who will turn 88 this month, has
witnessed the company suffer a number of setbacks that could
have likely been avoided or minimized,” the letter said.  
 H&R Block dropped 23 cents to $14.38 in 9:48 a.m. New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
