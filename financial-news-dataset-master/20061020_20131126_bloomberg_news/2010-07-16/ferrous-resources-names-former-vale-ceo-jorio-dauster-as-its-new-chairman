             Ferrous Resources Ltd. , seeking to
build a $3 billion iron ore operation in Brazil, appointed
former  Vale SA  Chief Executive Officer  Jorio Dauster  as chairman
after  Gordon Toll  resigned.  
 Dauster, who joined the Brazilian diplomatic service in
1961 and was ambassador to the European Union from 1991 to 1998,
has been a member of the Ferrous board since 2008, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. He was CEO of Brazil’s
Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore exporter, from 1999 to 2001.  
 Toll, 63, resigned six weeks after the company shelved
plans for a $400 million IPO in London because of volatility in
equity markets. Ferrous earlier shelved an IPO in 2008 as
commodity prices slumped and world economies slowed. The company
is backed by  Harbinger Capital Partners LLC , the New York-based
hedge fund founded by billionaire  Philip Falcone .  
 Harbinger nominated Managing Director  Larry Clark  and
Director of Investments  David Maura  to the board in further
changes announced today by Ferrous.  
 Toll, an Australian, former  Rio Tinto Group  executive and
former chairman of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., aims to focus on
a potash and a vanadium project in  Kazakhstan  which he plans to
float in the future, he said in an interview last week.  
 He’s also chairman of Petro Matad Ltd. which has an oil
project in Mongolia. The stock more than doubled in London
trading this week after it announced that drilling at an
exploration well had struck oil.
