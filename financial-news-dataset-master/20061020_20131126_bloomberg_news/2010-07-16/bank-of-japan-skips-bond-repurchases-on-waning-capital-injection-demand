             The Bank of Japan skipped repurchase
operations for government bonds today for the first time since
October 2008, adding to signs demand is waning for capital
injections.  
 The central bank has conducted the repurchase operations to
provide capital needed to spur an economic recovery, following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008.  
 “An excessive amount of capital in short-term money
markets seems to have caused the BOJ to put off the
operations,” said  Toshiaki Terada , a researcher at Totan
Research Co. in Tokyo. “The operations have provided confidence
for the repurchase market since the Lehman shock.”
