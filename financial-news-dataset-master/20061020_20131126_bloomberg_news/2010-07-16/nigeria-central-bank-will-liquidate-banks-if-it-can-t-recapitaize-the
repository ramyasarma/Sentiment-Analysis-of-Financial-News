             Nigeria’s central bank will
liquidate banks it took over last year if attempts to
recapitalize them are “frustrated,” Governor Lamido Sanusi
said.  
 The final decision on recapitalizing the lenders lies with
their shareholders, he said at a meeting in the capital, Abuja,
according to a statement posted on the banks’ website.  
 The Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria that will buy bad
debts from lenders will enhance the value of shareholders’
investments in the banks, he said.
