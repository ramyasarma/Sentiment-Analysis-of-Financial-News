             Raw-sugar prices fell from a three-
month high as slumping U.S. equities revived concern that a
slowing economy will limit demand for commodities. Cotton and
orange juice climbed.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  tumbled as much as 3
percent. A gauge of consumer confidence fell in July to the
lowest level in a year. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB Index fell as
much as 1.3 percent.  
 “Sugar’s setting up for a correction to the downside,”
said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “We’re seeing some plays across
the board,” and sugar moved with “everything else” as energy
and metals fell, he said.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.28 cent, or 1.6
percent, to 17.11 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the commodity reached 17.61 cents, the highest level
for a most-active contract since April 15. The price gained 3
percent this week.  
 Earlier, the price touched 16.86 cents.  
 “If we trade below 16.95 cents, that would be an outside
day, and the market would sell off, potentially testing lows in
May” at 13.67 cents on the October contract, Ilczyszyn said.  
 White-sugar futures for October delivery fell $8.50, or 1.6
percent, to $520 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in London.  
 Cotton futures for December delivery gained 0.49 cent, or
0.7 percent, to 73.96 cents a pound in New York. This week, the
price dropped 1.4 percent, the fourth straight decline.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 2.05
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $1.4015 a pound. The price gained 1.9
percent this week and is up 8.6 percent in 2010.
