             Argentina’s economy will grow “at
least” 6 percent this year, Economy Minister Amado Boudou said
in Buenos Aires.  
 South America’s second-biggest economy will have a trade
surplus of between $9 billion and $11 billion, Boudou said
today. The country will “probably” have a primary budget
surplus of 1.4 percent, he said.  
 The government has tapped almost $3 billion from a fund
created with central bank reserves to pay debt this year, Boudou
said, adding that Argentina won’t have any problems paying its
debts.
