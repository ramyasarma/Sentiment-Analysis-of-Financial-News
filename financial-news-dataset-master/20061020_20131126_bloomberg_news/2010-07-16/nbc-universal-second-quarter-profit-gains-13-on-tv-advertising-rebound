             NBC Universal, the  General Electric
Co.  media unit, reported a 13 percent gain in second-quarter
profit as television advertising rebounded.  
 Profit climbed to $607 million, from $539 million a year
ago, GE said today in a statement. Revenue at the New York-based
unit, run by  Jeffrey Zucker , rose 5.2 percent to $3.75 billion.  
 NBC Universal’s results were led by a 7 percent revenue
gain and 10 percent profit increase at its cable channels,
including USA, Bravo, Oxygen and CNBC, GE Chief Financial
Officer  Keith Sherin  said today on a conference call.  
 GE is selling a majority stake in the business to  Comcast
Corp. , the largest U.S. cable operator. The deal, agreed to in
December, is awaiting U.S. antitrust approval. European Union
regulators signed off on the takeover this week. Sherin said the
regulatory review is “progressing as expected.”  
 NBC, the broadcast network that finished in last place in
audience ratings among the top four networks this season, made
18 percent more this year in advertising sales ahead of the TV
season that starts in September, Sherin said. The network’s
revenue rose 1 percent to $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
and profit rose 6 percent. Local station sales climbed 25
percent.  
 Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE, which reported an overall
revenue decline, fell 46 cents, or 3 percent, to $14.79 at 10:44
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
