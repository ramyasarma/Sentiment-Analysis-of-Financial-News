             (Corrects number of units sold in sixth paragraph of story
that ran yesterday.)  
 U.S. sales of video games fell 6
percent in June to $1.1 billion after the strong appeal of
 Nintendo Co. ,  Sony Corp.  and  Microsoft Corp.  consoles failed to
offset weak game purchases.  
 Microsoft’s Xbox 360 sales gained 88 percent to 451,700
units after it introduced a slimmer version of its console with
a larger hard drive. It was the second-largest non-holiday month
of sales for the Redmond, Washington-based company’s Xbox 360,
behind the September 2007 release of the game Halo 3, research
firm NPD Group said today in a statement.  
 Nintendo sold 422,500 Wii consoles in the U.S. in June, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, NPD said. Sales of
Tokyo-based  Sony ’s PlayStation 3 jumped 85 percent to 304,800
units in June.  
 Nintendo’s DS handheld video-game player sales fell by a
third after the Kyoto, Japan-based company said it’s introducing
a version equipped with three cameras, a wireless connection and
a screen that displays 3-D images without the use of special
glasses. The company plans to start selling the 3DS player
before March 2011, prompting a 39 percent decline in May.  
 Games sales fell 15 percent to $531 million, hurt by a
relatively weak lineup of large-franchise titles as game
publishers hold major releases for the second half of the year,
which historically delivers higher sales.  
 Red Dead Redemption, from  New York-based Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc. , remained the top-selling video game
for a second month, with 963,000 units purchased for Xbox 360
and PS3, NPD said. Nintendo’s Super Mario Galaxy 2 sold 548,000
units for the Wii.  
 “Sales are more concentrated this year on the top-selling
games,” NPD analyst  Anita Frazier  said in the statement.
