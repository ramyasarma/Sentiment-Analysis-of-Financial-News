             BP Plc  said seismic tests of its
sealed Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico show no evidence of
hidden leaks and pressure readings may show a reduction of the
amount of oil in the reservoir.  
 BP’s temperature measurements from the well also don’t
indicate damage,  Kent Wells , BP’s senior vice president for
exploration and production, said on a conference call today.  
 Pressure inside the well rose slowly today to 6,720 pounds
per square inch from 6,700 pounds per square inch at the start
of the day, an encouraging sign that the well remains intact,
Wells said.  
 The company  will continue the test, aimed at determining
whether it can keep the well sealed until it can be permanently
plugged next month, for at least another six hours, Wells said.  
 BP , based in London, temporarily stopped the flow from the
Macondo gusher yesterday for the first time in almost three
months.
