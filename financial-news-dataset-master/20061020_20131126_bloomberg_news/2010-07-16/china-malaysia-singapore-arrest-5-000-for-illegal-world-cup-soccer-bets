             Interpol  said that more than 5,000
people were arrested and almost $10 million seized across Asia
in an operation targeting illegal soccer gambling.  
 Police in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand raided
nearly 800 illegal betting parlors, coinciding with this year’s
FIFA World Cup, the Lyon, France-based organization said in a
 statement  on its website. The casinos had been handling more
than $155 million in bets, the statement said.  
 “The results we have seen are impressive, not only in the
number of arrests and seizures made across the region in just
one month, but in terms of the police co-operation which made
this possible,” Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol’s executive
director of police services said in the statement.  
 The operation, codenamed SOGA III, was coordinated by
Interpol’s Drugs and Criminal Organizations unit at its Lyon
headquarters and its office in Bangkok, Interpol said. The
operation ran from June 11 to July 11, Interpol said.
