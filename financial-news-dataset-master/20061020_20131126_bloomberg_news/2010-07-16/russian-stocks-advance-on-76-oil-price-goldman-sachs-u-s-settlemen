             Russian stocks gained for the third
day this week as oil topped $76 a barrel and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. settled with U.S. regulators, improving appetite for
riskier assets.  
 OAO Surgutneftegaz , the country’s fourth-largest oil
producer, added 1.2 percent.  OAO Uralkali , Russia’s second-
largest potash producer, increased 0.6 percent, helping push the
 Micex Index  of 30 stocks 0.5 percent higher to 1,346.3 as of
1:57 p.m. in Moscow trading. The gauge erased losses of as much
as 0.3 percent.  
 Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, traded higher at
$76.67 after sliding yesterday when economic reports in the U.S.
disappointed investors. Goldman Sachs agreed yesterday to pay
$550 million and change its business practices to settle claims
it misled investors, sending U.S. stocks up from an early slump.
Concern the Goldman probe could widen was seen to be curbing
appetite for riskier assets and commodities.  
 “Investors seem to be happy with the Goldman result,”
 Daniel Salter , an emerging-markets strategist at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said by phone. “But the market is going to be volatile
for the next quarter with long-only money reluctant to commit to
Russia given the current volatility.”  
 The benchmark MSCI Russia index may rise to 980 by July
next year, ING said in an e-mailed note dated yesterday.
“Assuming a double dip can be avoided, our base case sees oil
trading at $80 a barrel” with “low global interest rates
supporting valuations,” analysts led by Salter said.  
 The Micex has fallen 12 percent since its April 15 peak on
concern economic growth may slow.
