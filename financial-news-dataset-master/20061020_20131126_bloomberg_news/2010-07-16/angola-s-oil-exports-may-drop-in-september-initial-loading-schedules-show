             Angola’s oil exports may drop in
September, preliminary loading schedules for 11 of its 13
biggest crude grades show.  
 Companies including  BP Plc , Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp. will load at least 38 cargoes totaling 35.7 million
barrels, or an average of 1.19 million barrels a day, according
to shipping programs obtained by Bloomberg. That includes two
“pooled” cargoes that aren’t assigned to a specific lifter.  
 The preliminary schedules, which don’t include the loading
plans for Girassol or Dalia, show a drop of 12 percent from
August. Exports of the two grades are scheduled to average
406,452 barrels a day in August.  
 Girassol production has been reduced because of “non-major
technical problems,” according to operator Total SA, causing
cargoes to be delayed from July to August and August to
September.  
 Total has declared force majeure on Girassol exports, a
legal clause allowing companies to cancel or delay contractual
obligations because of circumstances beyond their control.
