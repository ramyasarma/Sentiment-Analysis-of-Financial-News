             The average yield on Kenya’s 91-day
Treasury bills may fall to the lowest in at least four years as
trading in the debt markets increases.  
 The rate may decline to as low as 1.5 percent, David
Achungo, an investment manager at Pinebridge Investments East
Africa Ltd. said in the capital, Nairobi, on July 15. That’s the
lowest since at least March 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The central bank sold 5.18 billion shillings ($63.6
million) of 91-day bills at an average yield of 1.728 percent at
a sale yesterday. The bank received bids for 5.28 billion
shillings of the securities.  
 “The ample build-up in liquidity has forced rates down,”
Achungo said.  
 The average yield on 91-day bills offered by East Africa’s
biggest economy reached 8.619 percent in December 2008, the
highest since March 2006, when Bloomberg began continuous
records.  
 “Liquidity still remains high in the market as shown by
the oversubscription level of over 260 percent on the 25-year
bond,” at the first-ever auction of the securities in June,
Sterling Investment Bank said in an e-mailed report to clients
today. The Central Bank of Kenya “remains inclined towards a
low interest regime as it seeks to borrow cheaply to fund the
huge budget deficit.”  
 Kenya will widen its budget deficit to 6.8 percent of
gross domestic product in the fiscal year that started on July 1
as its boosts spending on salaries, bringing pressure on the
government to borrow more.  
 Spending  
 Expenditure will increase 10 percent to 998.8 billion
shillings ($12.4 billion) in the year beginning July 1, Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his June 10 budget speech.  
 The country’s inflation rate fell for the third time in
four months, reaching 3.2 percent in June and raising the
prospect of further interest rate cuts. The Central Bank of
Kenya, which targets inflation of 5 percent, kept its key rate
at 6.75 percent on May 20, after commercial banks slashed their
lending rates and the outlook for the economy picked up. The
bank has cut rates five times since the start of last year.  
 “Pressure has eased for servicing government debt,”
Sterling said in the note. “As a result, rates are expected to
stabilize in the short term, though an increase in inflation and
increased government borrowing may reduce surplus liquidity thus
cause the rates to edge up.”
