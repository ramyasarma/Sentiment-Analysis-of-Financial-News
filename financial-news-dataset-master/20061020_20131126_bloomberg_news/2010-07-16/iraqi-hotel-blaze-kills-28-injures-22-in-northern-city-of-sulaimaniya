             A fire engulfed a hotel in the
northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniyah, killing 28 people, half of
them foreigners, and injuring 22, the Kurdistan Regional
Government said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The fire broke out at the five-story Soma Hotel yesterday
at 10:30 p.m. after an electrical short circuit. Sulaimaniyah,
270 kilometers (170 miles) from Baghdad, is the second-largest
city in the oil-rich semi-autonomous region.  
 The 14 foreigners who died were from Canada, Australia,
South Africa, the U.K., Ecuador, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Lebanon,
Bangladesh and Cambodia, the KRG said. One victim has yet to be
identified.  
 Regional Prime Minister  Barham Salih  said his
administration is working with the embassies and consulates of
the countries concerned to inform the next of kin and facilitate
repatriation of the bodies, according to the statement.  
 Salih ordered an immediate review of fire-safety measures
at all public buildings in Sulaimaniyah and the rest of the
region. News agencies including the Associated Press cited
witnesses as saying some people jumped out of the hotel’s
windows to escape the blaze because there were no fire escapes.  
 “We will spare no effort in making sure such tragedies do
not occur in the future,” said Salih, who visited the scene and
the hospital where the injured were being treated. “Our hearts
go out to the families of the victims.”  
 Some of the dead worked for the Asiacell mobile phone
company, AP reported.
