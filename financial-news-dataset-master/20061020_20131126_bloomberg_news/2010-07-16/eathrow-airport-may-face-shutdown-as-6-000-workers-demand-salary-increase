             London’s Heathrow airport , the
busiest in Europe, could be closed by strike action as the Unite
union ballots more than 6,000 security staff, engineers and
firefighters in a pay dispute with owner BAA Ltd.  
 The vote, which includes workers at BAA’s London Stansted
airport and terminals in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in
Scotland and Southampton on England’s south coast, will run from
July 23 to Aug. 12, Unite said in a statement today.  
 Heathrow, the world’s second-busiest airport after Atlanta
Hartsfield, has already been affected by walkouts this year
after Unite called strikes by British Airways Plc cabin crew
over staffing levels, pay and contract terms. At BAA, the union
is seeking a raise after salaries were unchanged last year.  
 “BAA staff have already accepted a pay freeze in 2009 to
help the company, but they are not prepared to accept such a
paltry offer this year,”  Brendan Gold , Unite’s national
aviation officer, said in the statement. A deal can be reached
if BAA is prepared to be “fairer and more realistic,” he said.  
 BAA, based in London and owned by Spanish builder Ferrovial
SA, said a proposed 1.5 percent pay raise is fair as passenger
numbers have fallen following the recession and the grounding of
flights after a volcanic eruption in Iceland in April.  
 “We regret Unite’s decision, which will cause unnecessary
concern for millions of our passengers and damage Britain’s
reputation around the world,” BAA said in a statement today.
