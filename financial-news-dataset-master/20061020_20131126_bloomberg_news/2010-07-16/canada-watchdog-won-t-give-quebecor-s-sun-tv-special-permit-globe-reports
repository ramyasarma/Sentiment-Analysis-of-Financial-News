             Quebecor Inc.  won’t get a special
permit for its proposed Sun TV news and analysis channel that
would have forced all cable consumers to subscribe to the
offering, the Globe and Mail  reported,  citing a private letter
the Canadian regulator sent to the company.  
 The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission said in its July 5 letter that it wouldn’t change its
March decision to wait until October 2011 before considering new
“must-carry” licenses, the Toronto-based newspaper reported.  
 Quebecor had requested a must-carry permit and wanted to
get special consideration arguing the service will be a new kind
of channel: a mix of news and analysis, rather than just news,
the Globe said.  
 Kory Teneycke, the head of the Quebecor project, said the
company planned to submit an amended application, the newspaper
said.
