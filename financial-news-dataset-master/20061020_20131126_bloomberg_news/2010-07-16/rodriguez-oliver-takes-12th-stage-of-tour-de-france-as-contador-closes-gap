             Joaquin Rodriguez Oliver took the
12th stage of the Tour de France as Alberto Contador used the
steep finish to cut into the lead of Andy Schleck.  
 Rodriguez Oliver, a member of the Katusha team, formed a
breakaway with fellow Spaniard Contador and then sprinted to the
victory. Contador was able to cut about 10 seconds off Schleck’s
lead, which was 41 seconds at the start of the day.
