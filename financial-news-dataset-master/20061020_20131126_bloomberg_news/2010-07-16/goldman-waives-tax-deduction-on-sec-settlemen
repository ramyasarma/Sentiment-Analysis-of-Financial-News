             Goldman Sachs Group Inc . agreed to
waive tax deductions it could have claimed after paying a $550
million penalty in a settlement with U.S. regulators, giving up
as much as $187.5 million in savings.  
 In yesterday’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, the firm agreed “it shall not claim,
assert or apply for a tax deduction” for any penalty amounts.
Goldman Sachs will pay a $535 million civil penalty, which
normally would be deductible, and give up $15 million in
profits, which the firm likely can still deduct.  
 “It’s unusual, but not unheard of” for companies to forgo
tax deductions when negotiating settlements, said  Robert Willens , founder of Robert Willens LLC, a consulting firm that
advises investors on tax and accounting rules. “It’s actually
become a little more popular in recent years for the government
to insist that no deduction be taken for any portion of the
payment.”  
 In order to deduct the payments, Goldman Sachs would have
had to argue that a portion were compensatory and would be paid
to third parties rather than the government. Other companies
have argued that position, said  Ron Pearlman , a tax law
professor at Georgetown University.  
 Explicit Prohibition  
 The settlement explicitly bars the company from claiming
deductions “regardless of whether such penalty amounts, or any
part thereof, are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used
for the benefit of investors.”  
 In Goldman Sach’s case, Pearlman said, the company “likely
concluded that it would not be good PR if it became known, as it
undoubtedly would, that Goldman Sachs attempted to deduct the
penalty.”  
 Giving up the tax deduction makes the penalty appear
smaller than paying a larger penalty and retaining the
deductions. Had Goldman Sachs agreed to a $1 billion fine and
kept its federal and state deductions, the net outlay would have
been about $600 million.  
 In the settlement, Goldman Sachs acknowledged that
marketing materials for a 2007 deal at the center of the case
contained “incomplete information.” The SEC’s suit filed in
April accused the firm of defrauding investors in a mortgage-
backed collateralized debt obligation by failing to tell them
that hedge fund Paulson & Co., which was planning to bet against
the deal, had helped design it.
