             Gold climbed on signs of slower
growth in the U.S. and China, and speculation that a weaker
dollar will spur demand for the metal as an alternative asset.  
 The dollar slid to a nine-week low against the euro
yesterday as U.S. manufacturing contracted in June by the most
in a year and producer prices fell. U.S. retail sales declined
for a second month in June, a July 14 report showed. The  Dollar
Index , a six-currency gauge of the dollar’s value, headed for a
sixth weekly fall.  
 “The dollar is very weak now, which is actually propping
up gold,” said  Chris Yoo , manager of the global derivatives
team at Seoul-based Samsung Futures Inc. “The dollar will
affect bullion for the time being.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery in London climbed $2.30, or 0.2
percent, to $1,210.55 an ounce at 10:31 a.m. Seoul time. The
August-delivery contract advanced 0.2 percent to $1,210.50 an
ounce on the Comex in New York.  
 Gold climbed to an all-time high last month as investors
sought to protect their wealth against the debt crisis in Greece
and other European nations struggling to repay debt, and on
concern that the global recovery may slow. The metal has gained
10 percent this year and is set for a 10th annual increase, the
longest run of gains since at least 1920.  
 The Federal Reserve on July 14 cut its forecast for the U.S.
economy’s expansion, and China said yesterday that the pace of
growth dropped in the second quarter.  
 Sixteen of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said that bullion will climb next week.  
 Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$18.3325 an ounce, while platinum gained 0.3 percent to
$1,534.35 an ounce and palladium dropped 0.5 percent to $465.50
an ounce.
