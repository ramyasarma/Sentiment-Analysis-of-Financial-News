             Rautaruukki Oyj , Finland’s largest
producer of carbon steel, advanced the most in two months in
Helsinki trading after posting a profit in the second quarter.  
 Rautaruukki  rose as much as 8.4 percent to 14.30 euros, the
biggest gain since May 10, and was at 14.09 euros as of 11:40
a.m. local time.  
 The company reported net income of 20 million euros ($25.9
million), compared with a net loss of 94 million euros a year
earlier, according to a statement today. Analysts expected a 2.5
million-euro loss, according to the  average estimate  of 10
responses compiled by Bloomberg. Sales jumped 50 percent to 655
million euros, beating analysts’ 592 million-euro estimate.  
 Rautaruukki raised its sales growth forecast for the year
to between 25 percent and 30 percent from a previous estimate of
15 to 20 percent. Earnings will also increase on faster economic
growth and operational improvements, according to Chief
Executive Officer  Sakari Tamminen .  
 “Our actions to improve efficiency have progressed much
faster than planned and we estimate the actions we have already
initiated to date will result in an annualised improvement of
149 million euros in the company’s operating profit,” Tamminen
said. Production costs will exceed previous forecasts, he said.
