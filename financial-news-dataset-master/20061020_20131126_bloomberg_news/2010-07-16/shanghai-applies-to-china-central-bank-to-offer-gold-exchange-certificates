             The Shanghai Stock Exchange has
submitted a proposal to China’s central bank for introduction of
a gold exchange certificate developed with the Shanghai Gold
Exchange, said  Liu Ti , an official with the stock exchange.  
 The gold exchange certificates, designed for institutional
investors such as insurers and mutual funds, would be traded on
the Shanghai exchange, Liu, director of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange’s innovation department, said at a Guosen Securities Co.
conference in the city of Qingdao today. They would be sponsored
by the gold exchange instead of a fund as China prohibits mutual
funds from investing in gold, Liu said.  
 China’s largest stock exchange is also planning to
introduce cross-border exchange traded funds, Liu said. The
cross-border ETFs would push forward Shanghai’s plans for
foreign companies to sell shares publicly in the city, he said.
