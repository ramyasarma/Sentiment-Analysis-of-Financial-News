             AT&T Inc. ’s U-verse TV customers
will continue to receive the AMC, IFC and WE tv channels after
the company reached a new programming agreement with  Cablevision
System Corp. ’s Rainbow Media.  
 AT&T, based in Dallas, and Cablevision’s Rainbow Media
announced the agreement today in separate statements. Terms
weren’t disclosed. The accord came a day after AT&T accused
Rainbow Media and Cablevision of failing to negotiate in good
faith and trying to charge “significantly more” than what
competitors pay on average.  
 The dispute between AT&T and Rainbow Media, whose AMC airs
the Emmy winning “Mad Men” series, marked the latest price
skirmish between program suppliers and pay-TV systems. Content
owners, including broadcasters, have been pressing pay-TV
services for a greater share of their subscriber income.  
 The agreement “recognizes the value of our networks,”
Rainbow Media said in statement.  
 Cablevision, based in Bethpage, New York, advanced 32 cents
to $26.13 in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading  prior to
the announcement and has risen 23 percent this year.  
 AT&T, which called the accord “the fair deal we wanted for
our customers,” gained 4 cents today to $25. The  shares  have
fallen 11 percent this year.
