             Shougang Corp.  will pay 2.5 billion
yuan ($369 million) to take control of Tonghua Iron & Steel
Group to form China’s sixth-largest steelmaker, a year after the
local government scrapped another deal following a riot.  
 Shougang, controlled by the Beijing city government, will
buy 77.6 percent of Tonghua,  Wu Jianxin , a Shougang spokesman,
said today by phone. The Jilin provincial government, in north
eastern China, will retain a 10 percent stake, he said.  
 Jianlong Steel Holding Co., a closely held mill, scrapped
its Tonghua takeover last year after workers worried about
layoffs following the deal killed an executive. Shougang’s
takeover underscores the Chinese government’s desire to
consolidate an industry it said was polluting, energy intensive
and contained excess capacity.  
 China Huarong Asset Management Corp. , one of the nation’s
four managers of bad loans for state-owned banks, will take a
10.3 percent stake in Tonghua, Shougang’s Wu said.  
 The combination of the two state-owned companies may create
a steelmaker with a combined production of 22.5 million metric
tons, based on 2009 figures. Shougang made 17.3 million tons
last year, making it the country’s seventh-largest mill.  
 Tonghua Steel posted a loss of more than 1 billion yuan
last year, following on a loss of 776 million yuan in 2008,
China Business News reported today.  
 Workers unrest at car and electronic factories, including
those run by Honda Motor Co., have forced firms to offer higher
wages this year.
