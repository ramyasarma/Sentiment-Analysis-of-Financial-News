             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  will
reserve the right to file future lawsuits against  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  after the Wall Street firm agreed to pay $100 million
in compensation as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators, a
person with knowledge of the matter said.  
 RBS hasn’t been asked to waive its right to file lawsuits
and has a strong legal case following New York-based Goldman’s
agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a
$550 million fine, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private.  
 RBS, which was bailed out by the British taxpayer, lost
about $841 million on a collateralized debt obligation arranged
by Goldman Sachs. U.S. authorities sued Goldman in April,
alleging that the bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages without disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson &
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against them.  
 “RBS has been monitoring the complaint closely,” the
Edinburgh-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. “Following
the SEC’s announcement, RBS will now carefully consider all of
its options.”  
 Germany’s IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG will receive about
$150 million payment as part of the settlement after it lost
about the same amount on the Goldman Sachs CDO. KfW Group, the
German development bank that bailed out IKB during the credit
crisis, said it will also review the settlement.  
 ‘Examining the Decision’  
 “KfW is examining the decision from last night,”
spokesman  Michael Helbig  said today, declining to comment
further.  
 Rhineland Funding, IKB’s former investment vehicle,
invested in the Goldman securities. Rhineland Funding ran out of
money amid the credit crunch in 2007, forcing KfW to assume 8.1
billion euros of IKB’s financing obligations to prevent the
lender’s collapse, IKB spokesman Patrick von der Ehe said.  
 Under the terms of Goldman Sachs’s settlement with the SEC,
the firm is prohibited from denying, directly or indirectly, any
of the allegations in the SEC’s complaint. The complaint, which
was filed on April 16, accused Goldman Sachs of intentionally
misleading investors in the Abacus CDO.  
 The firm “is acknowledging that its marketing materials
were deficient and failed to disclose material information,”
 Lorin Reisner , the SEC’s enforcement director, said yesterday.
Goldman yesterday agreed to pay $550 million and change its
business practices to settle U.S. regulatory claims. The penalty
is the largest levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission
against a Wall Street firm.  
 A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London declined to comment.  
 A U.K. investigation of Goldman Sachs by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority is “ongoing,” said Toby Parker, a spokesman
for the regulator in London. The FSA said in April that it would
review “any implications for the U.K.-regulated entities of
Goldman Sachs” after the Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  called for
a probe.
