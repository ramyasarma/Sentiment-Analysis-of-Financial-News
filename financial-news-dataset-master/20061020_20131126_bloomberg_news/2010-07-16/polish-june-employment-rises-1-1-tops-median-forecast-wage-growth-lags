             Polish corporate employment rose by
1.1 percent on the year in June, its biggest annual increase
since December 2008, according to figures published by the
Central Statistical Office today. That exceeds the 1 percent
median forecast of seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Average corporate wages rose by an annual 3.5 percent in
June. The median forecast of eight economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 5.0 percent increase.
