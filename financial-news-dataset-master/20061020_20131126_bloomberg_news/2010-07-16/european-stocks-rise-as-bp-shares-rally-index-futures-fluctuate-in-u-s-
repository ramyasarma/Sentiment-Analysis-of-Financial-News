             European stocks advanced for the
first time in three days, as shares of BP Plc rallied after the
oil company halted the flow of oil from its leaking well in the
Gulf of Mexico. Asian shares fell and U.S. index futures were
little changed.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.4 percent to 253.89 at
8:03 a.m. in London. BP surged 6 percent to 425.85 pence. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1 percent, while futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in September rose less than
0.1 percent.
