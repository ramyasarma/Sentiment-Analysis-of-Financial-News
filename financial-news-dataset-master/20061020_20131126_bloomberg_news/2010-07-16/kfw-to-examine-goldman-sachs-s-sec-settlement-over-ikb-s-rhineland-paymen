             KfW Group , Germany’s development
bank that bailed out  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG , said it is
reviewing  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s settlement with U.S.
regulators that includes a $150 million payment to IKB.  
 Goldman Sachs, based in New York, agreed to pay $550
million to settle U.S. regulatory claims it misled investors
over collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages, the  Securities and Exchange Commission  said
yesterday. As part of the agreement, Goldman agreed to pay a
$300 million fine and $250 million in restitution to investors
including IKB and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  
 “KfW is examining the decision from last night,”
spokesman  Michael Helbig  said today, declining further comment.  
 IKB spokesman Patrick von der Ehe said a unit of Rhineland
Funding, IKB’s former investment vehicle, invested in the
Goldman securities. Rhineland Funding ran out of money amid the
credit crunch in 2007, forcing KfW to assume 8.1 billion euros
of IKB’s financing obligations to prevent a collapse of the
lender.
