             Bank of America Corp.  led financial
stocks lower after saying U.S. curbs on debit-card fees may
trigger a $10 billion charge, spurring speculation that rival
banks have underestimated their own costs.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was the only gainer among the
nation’s largest lenders at  midday , while Bank of America, the
biggest in the U.S., dropped as much as 8.6 percent. Citigroup
Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Visa Inc., which runs the largest
card-payment network, slid more than 5 percent. MasterCard Inc.
and  American Express Co.  declined as much as 4 percent.  
 The slide began after Bank of America said rules in the
financial industry overhaul, including the Durbin amendment’s
curbs on debit-card fees, may prompt the charge and trim annual
 revenue  by $2.3 billion, more than some of the most pessimistic
estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co., ranked second by assets in the
U.S., dropped as much as 3.6 percent.  
 “We are seeing brutal honesty and transparency” from Bank
of America, said  Nancy Bush , an independent bank analyst. “It’s
going to have a big impact on all of the big banks.”  
 Bank of America declined 7.8 percent to $14.19 at 12:39
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Moody’s
Investors Service said in June that Bank of America, Wells Fargo
and JPMorgan, the three biggest U.S. debit-card issuers, may
face $1.38 billion in annual lost revenue from the proposed cap
on “swipe” fees. DBRS Inc., the Toronto-based ratings firm had
said the impact just for Bank of America could be $1.9 billion.  
 Shrinking Revenue  
 Bank of America’s debit-card revenue could shrink by
$1.8 billion to $2.3 billion starting in the third quarter of
next year because of restrictions on fees merchants can charge
for each swipe of a debit card, Chief Executive  Brian Moynihan 
said in a presentation today. The bank is seeking ways to
replace some of the revenue lost to the Durbin rule, named after
Sen.  Richard Durbin , the Illinois Democrat who sponsored the
amendment, Moynihan said.  
 The bank also expects a goodwill charge of $7 billion to
$10 billion in the third quarter tied to the value of the
business after President  Barack Obama  signs the regulatory
reform law approved by Congress this week, Chief Financial
Officer  Charles Noski  said on a conference call. Goodwill is the
difference between the price paid for an asset and its fair
market value.  
 Lower Forecast  
 Banks had lobbied against the Durbin amendment, while
retailers touted the changes as being pro-consumer. “It’s
regulating a transaction between two businesses,” Noski said.
“This isn’t going to benefit consumers at all.”  
 Card companies have predicted card users will pay higher
fees and get lower perks and “points” for free travel and
discounted merchandise.
