             South Korea’s won strengthened
against the dollar after Spain attracted stronger demand at a
government bond auction, easing concern Europe’s debt crisis
will sap demand for emerging-market assets.  
 The currency also rose after U.S. data showed manufacturing
contracted in June by the most in a year and wholesale prices
declined more than anticipated, weakening demand for the U.S.
dollar. The won rose 0.2 percent to 1,199.80 per dollar as of
9:34 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
has lost 0.3 percent this week, Asia’s worst performance.  
 “The won may just trade around 1,190 to 1,200 against the
dollar even as the greenback fell a bit,” said  Yun Saemin , a
currency dealer at Busan Bank in Seoul. “The market is also
doubting whether the euro can hang on to its gains.”  
 Spain sold the full 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-
year bonds planned, attracting bids for 2.57 times the
securities on offer compared with 1.79 at the last auction in
April. A Fed report showed U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent
in June. Producer prices slid 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percent
decline the month before, the Labor Department said yesterday.  
 South Korea’s government bonds were little changed. The
yield on the 3.75 percent note due June 2013 fell one basis
point to 3.92 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
