             India’s rupee declined on concern
investors will pare holdings of emerging-market assets after the
latest U.S. manufacturing data added to evidence a global
economic recovery is losing steam.  
 The currency headed for a weekly loss as the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index  of regional shares fell 0.8 percent. Factory
output in the world’s largest economy fell 0.4 percent in June,
the most in a year, while producer prices lost 0.5 percent after
a 0.3 percent drop the month before, reports from the U.S.
showed yesterday.  
 “Financial market sentiment still remains jittery because
the global economic outlook remains far from reassuring,” said
 Roy Paul , deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“The rupee is likely to maintain a weak bias in the short
term.”  
 The rupee retreated 0.3 percent to 46.735 per dollar as of
10:14 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It has slid 0.1 percent this week and is the worst performer
this month among Asian currencies, with a 0.6 percent loss.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 47.30 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 47.18 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.
