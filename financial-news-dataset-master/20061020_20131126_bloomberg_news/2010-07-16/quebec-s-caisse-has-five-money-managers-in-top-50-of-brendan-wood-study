Quebec, the pension-fund manager that posted a record loss in
2008, has five of the top 50 equity managers in Canada this
year, according to a study by  Brendan Wood International .  
 The Caisse’s Jean-Frederic Berard, Jean-Francois Jolicoeur,
Stephen Kibsey, Francois Lebel and Louis-Phillipe Thibodeau were
among the top vote-getters in the poll of analysts obtained by
Bloomberg News. It’s the second annual study by Brendan Wood
International, a provider of information used by capital markets
businesses.  
 In the past 16 months, Canada’s biggest pension-fund
manager has cut jobs, scaled back the use of derivatives and
exited businesses after reporting a C$39.8 billion ($38.3
billion) loss in 2008 on asset sales and writedowns tied to
insolvent Canadian commercial paper.  
 The Montreal-based Caisse, which managed C$131.6 billion in
net assets at year-end including C$46.4 billion in  equities ,
hired former BCE Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Michael Sabia  as
CEO in March 2009. The Caisse posted a 10 percent return on
investments last year.  
 “We invest a lot in research and market analysis, and it’s
gratifying to see that our efforts are recognized by the
industry,”  Jean-Luc Gravel , executive vice-president of
equities at Caisse, said in a statement.  
 Canadian equities  returned  37 percent last year for the
Caisse, compared with a 31 percent return for the  S&P/TSX
Composite Index . At year-end, the Caisse held Canadian stocks
valued at C$17.1 billion.  
 RBC Tops List  
 Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC Asset Management  unit topped the
list for the second year with six money managers, including
 Stuart Kedwell  and  Doug Raymond . Phillips, Hager & North
Investment Management, a unit of RBC, has two investors on the
list.  
 Goodman & Co. had four on the list, including  Oscar Belaiche  and  Rohit Sehgal . Sentry Select Capital also had four,
including  Sandy McIntyre  and  Kevin MacLean .  
 There were 19 new managers on the list this year, including
 Norm Lamarche  of Front Street Capital Inc. and the Caisse’s
Berard.  
 “The Caisse is one of those pension funds with a
complicated and politically demanding mandate,” Brendan Wood,
chairman of Brendan Wood International, said yesterday in an
interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “They’re responsible
for the pension funds of the public-service employees of Quebec.
It’s an immense responsibility.”  
 Surveyed 400 Analysts  
 The research company, founded in 1970 to investigate
performance in capital markets, surveyed 400 analysts at 65
firms, with about half of those polled in Canada. The analysts
were asked to name their top equity-portfolio managers based on
their insight, knowledge and influence in the Canadian stock
markets.  
 Brendan Wood International compiled the top-50 list based
on the number of votes they received. It didn’t release the vote
tally for each money manager.
