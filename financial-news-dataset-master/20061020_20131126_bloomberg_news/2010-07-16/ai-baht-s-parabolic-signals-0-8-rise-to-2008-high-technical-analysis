             The Thai baht may strengthen 0.8
percent against the dollar in a month, taking it to a two-year
high, after a technical indicator known as the Parabolic System
pointed to a buy signal for the currency, according to
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  
 The baht may appreciate to a “psychologically important
level” of 32 per dollar should it strengthen beyond the May 7
and April 21 highs of 32.15 and 32.07, respectively, said  Minoru Shioiri , chief manager of foreign-exchange trading at Mitsubishi
UFJ. The currency traded at 32.24 as of 8:50 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 32.22, the
strongest since May 10.  
 The Parabolic System is represented by a series of dots on
a chart, or a stop-and-reversal-point. If the price of an asset
is below the SAR, in this case the dollar, then you should sell
it. The greenback’s five-day moving average also dropped below
the 20-day line on July 13 to form a pattern called a “golden
cross,” another bullish signal for the baht, said Shioiri.  
 “Many technical indicators this week began to show signs
of baht strength,” said Tokyo-based Shioiri. “The pace of the
appreciation may be gradual due to potential intervention by the
central bank to stem the currency’s gains.”  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
