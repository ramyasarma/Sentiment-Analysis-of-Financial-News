             Support for Polish opposition party
Law & Justice rose in July to the highest since the 2007
parliamentary elections after its leader won the backing of
almost half those who voted in this month’s presidential race.  
 Law & Justice was backed by 30 percent of those surveyed in
the July 8-14 poll by the  Center for Public Research , up 2
percentage points since June. The ruling Civic Platform lost 2
percentage points, with backing from 40 percent in the poll.  
 Another opposition party, the Democratic Left Alliance,
increased its standing by 3 percentage points to 11 percent, the
highest since 2007, and junior coalition partner, the Polish
Peasants’ Party, had 3 percent support, 1 percentage point less
than in June.  
 The survey was carried out among 899 Poles. The researcher
didn’t publish the survey’s margin of error.
