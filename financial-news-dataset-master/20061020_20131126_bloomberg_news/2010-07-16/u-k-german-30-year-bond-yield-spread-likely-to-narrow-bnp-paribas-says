             The  extra yield  investors demand to
hold U.K. 30-year bonds instead of German securities may narrow
as British inflation subsides and the nation refrains from
selling similar-maturity debt this quarter, BNP Paribas SA said.  
 “We find tactical long gilt 30-year positions versus
Germany tempting, particularly ahead of the launch of the new
bund 2042” on July 21,  Matteo Regesta , a fixed-income
strategist in London, said by e-mail today. “The June inflation
data still pointed to a continuation of the downward path” in
the U.K. that started in May, he said. “The issuance calendar
does not include further long-end issuance until at least
October,” apart from one sale of a 2030 gilt, Regesta wrote.
