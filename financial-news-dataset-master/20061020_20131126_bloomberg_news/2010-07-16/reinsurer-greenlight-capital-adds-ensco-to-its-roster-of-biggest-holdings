             David Einhorn’s  Greenlight Capital
Re Ltd. added offshore oil driller  Ensco Plc  as one of its six
largest holdings.  
 Ensco, the London-based company with rigs from Mexico to
India, was added to a list of Greenlight’s biggest investments
as of June 30, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Chemical maker  Arkema SA ,
lender CIT Group Inc., gold, drugmaker Pfizer Inc. and mobile-
phone operator Vodafone Group Plc are the other holdings.  
 Investment gains by property and casualty insurance
companies in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $12.6 billion,
more than triple the $3.7 billion in the year-earlier period,
according to a July 7 presentation by the  Insurance Information
Institute . Greenlight’s return on investment in the three months
ended June 30 was 2.6 percent, compared with a 1.9 percent loss
in the first quarter and down from a 13.9 percent gain in the
year-ago period, according to the  company’s website .  
 Ensco plunged to a  52-week low of $33.33  on June 3, as
shares of energy companies retreated after an explosion on a rig
leased by BP Plc in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the worst oil
spill in U.S. history. Ensco fell $1.44, or 3.5 percent, to
$40.25 as of 4 p.m. today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Greenlight declined $1.01, or 3.9 percent, to $25 on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.  
 Tim Courtis , Greenlight’s chief financial officer, said the
company doesn’t comment on its investments.
