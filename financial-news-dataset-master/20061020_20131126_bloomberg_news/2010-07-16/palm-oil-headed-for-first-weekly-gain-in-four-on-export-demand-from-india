             Palm oil had the best winning run
since February to reach a six-week high on speculation demand
for the most-consumed vegetable oil will increase as India and
other populous Asian nations approach the festival season.  
 September-delivery futures rose for a seventh day, adding
1.3 percent to 2,470 ringgit ($770) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange. The price reached 2,480 ringgit intraday,
the highest since June 4.  
 “We expect demand to pick up as soybean oil’s premium is
increasing and demand for Ramadan and Deepavali event will
begin,”  Herman Koeswanto , an analyst at PT Andalan Artha
Advisindo Sekuritas in Jakarta, said in a report today.  
 China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia mark their important
festivals in the quarter ending September, with communal meals
stoking edible oils consumption.  
 Soybean oil rallied for a sixth day to 39.48 cents a pound,
lifting its  premium  over palm oil to $100.41 a ton from a low of
$56.47 a ton on April 30 this year, according to Bloomberg data.
The two oils are direct substitutes.  
 Greater-than-expected exports of palm oil from in Malaysia,
the second-largest producer, pared June  stockpiles  to a 10-month
low of 1.45 million tons, the country’s Palm Oil Board said this
week. Exports rose 5.5 percent to 1.44 million tons, exceeding
estimates by Intertek and Societe Generale de Surveillance.  
 Overseas sales rose 11 percent to 668,573 tons in the first
15 days of July as an increase in orders from India and the
subcontinent made up for a drop in sales to China, Intertek said
yesterday. Purchases by India and the subcontinent surged to
160,040 tons from 62,202 tons in the same period in June.  
 Supply Shortage  
 “In our view, India will need incremental supplies to meet
domestic demand since there’s lack of supplies locally due to
lower rainfall,” Koeswanto said.  
 India is the top buyer of palm oil, using it to supplement
local production of oils from soybeans, groundnuts, cottonseeds,
and other oilseeds. The country’s monsoon rains were 24 percent
below normal last week, and 14 percent below average since the
season began on June 1, the weather office said yesterday.  
 Earlier this week,  Govindlal G. Patel , director of Dipak
Enterprise, a trader of vegetable oils, forecast Indian demand
would rise. Imports of palm and soybean oils in the quarter to
Oct. 31 may be 2.6 million tons, 24 percent higher than a year
earlier, Patel said July 13.  
 September-delivery soybean oil rose 1.2 percent yesterday,
while soybeans for November delivery climbed 2.7 percent to
$9.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  
 CME Group Inc.’s September-delivery palm oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, added 8 percent to
$763.75 a ton yesterday, the most since the contract started
trading in May.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
advanced 2.2 percent to 6,538 yuan ($965) a ton.
