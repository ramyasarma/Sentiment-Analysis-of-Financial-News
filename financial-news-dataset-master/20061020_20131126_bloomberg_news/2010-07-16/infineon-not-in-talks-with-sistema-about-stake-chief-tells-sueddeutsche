             Infineon Technologies AG is not in
talks with AFK Sistema about the Russian company purchasing a
stake in the German semiconductor supplier, Sueddeutsche Zeitung
reported, citing Infineon Chief Executive Officer Peter Bauer.  
 Infineon regards Asia, not Russia, as the market with the
most growth potential, according to the newspaper. Bauer brushed
off Sistema’s interest even as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
discussed a possible partnership in recent talks with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Sueddeutsche said.  
 Bauer is optimistic the industry’s recovery will be
sustained, the newspaper said. Infineon expects to benefit even
more from a decline in the euro in the fourth quarter of its
fiscal  year, Sueddeutsche said. In the 2010-2011 fiscal year,
it expects sales to increase at a high single-digit percentage
rate, the newspaper said.
