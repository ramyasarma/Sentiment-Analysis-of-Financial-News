             Argentina may sell bonds at the
“right moment” in order to establish a benchmark rate for
companies seeking to tap markets, Economy Minister Amado Boudou
said.  
 Argentina doesn’t need to sell debt to finance the
government, Boudou told reporters today in the city of Mar del
Plata. Any bond sale would be “symbolic,” he added.
