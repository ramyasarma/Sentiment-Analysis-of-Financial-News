             Russian stocks may rally 30 percent
in the next 12 months, ING Groep NV said. The benchmark MSCI
Russia index may rise to 980 by July next year, ING said in an
e-mailed note dated yesterday.  
 “Assuming a double dip can be avoided, our base case sees
oil trading at $80 a barrel” with “low global interest rates
supporting valuations,” it said.
