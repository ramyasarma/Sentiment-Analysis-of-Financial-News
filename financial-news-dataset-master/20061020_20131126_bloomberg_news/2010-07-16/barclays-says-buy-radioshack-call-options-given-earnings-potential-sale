             Investors should buy bullish
RadioShack Corp.  options  because the electronics retailer may
rally if the company is sold or after reporting increased profit
from smartphone sales, Barclays Plc said.  
 Maneesh Deshpande , who leads the top-ranked equity
derivatives strategy team in Institutional Investor magazine’s
2009 survey, recommended buying October $21 calls while selling
October $25 calls, a strategy known as a spread that cuts the
cost of the trade while capping potential profit. The shares
climbed 2.1 percent to $21.61 yesterday.  
 “We prefer call spreads to straight calls since they
cheapen the overall cost and explicitly imbed our analyst’s view
that near-term upside over $25 is unlikely,” The Barclays
strategist wrote. “Shorter-dated options are an attractive way
to express a positive view on the stock.”  
 Second-quarter earnings at RadioShack, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, may have been lifted by sales of smartphones such as
Apple Inc.’s iPhone 4, Deshpande said. The report may be
released on July 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Deshpande cited analyst  Michael Lasser , the Barclays analyst who
has rated the shares at “overweight” since December and has a
$26 share-price forecast.  
 RadioShack  gained  4.1 percent on July 13, the most in more
than a month, on renewed speculation that the company may be the
target of a takeover bid. The stock tumbled 5.5 percent on July
14 after CNBC’s  David Faber  said a sale of the electronics
retailer doesn’t appear imminent.
