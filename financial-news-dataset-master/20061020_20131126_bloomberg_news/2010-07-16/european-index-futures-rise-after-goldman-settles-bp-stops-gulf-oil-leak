             European stocks  retreated for a
third day, led by a selloff in banks, after Citigroup Inc. and
Bank of America Corp. reported revenue that missed analysts’
estimates and U.S. consumer confidence fell more than forecast.  
 Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA and Credit Suisse Group AG
declined more than 2.5 percent. RWE AG and E.ON AG led utilities
lower after Germany proposed a tax on nuclear power plants.
Roche Holding AG sank 4.2 percent as U.S. regulators said the
drugmaker’s top-seller Avastin didn’t slow breast tumors in new
studies as much as in earlier tests used to win approval.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 1.9 percent to 248.11,
erasing the measure’s gains for the week even as company
earnings from Alcoa Inc. to Intel Corp. beat estimates. The
gauge has fallen 8.8 percent from this year’s high on April 15
amid concern that the global economic recovery is losing steam.  
 “There is nervousness around,” said  Bill Dinning , head of
strategy at Aegon NV’s Edinburgh-based fund management unit.
“Investors are concerned that even with good earnings from Q2
there are still question marks out there. Clearly we have
started to see some slowing in the economy.”  
 National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets, except Greece, with stocks extending losses
after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
 index of U.S. consumer sentiment  for July slid to the lowest
level in a year. Germany’s DAX lost 1.8 percent, France’s CAC 40
sank 2.3 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 1 percent.  
 U.S. Earnings  
 European stocks earlier swung between gains and losses as
U.S. companies from General Electric Co. to Bank of America and
Citigroup reported second-quarter results. All three companies
beat estimates for per-share earnings while missing on sales.  
 Barclays, the U.K.’s third-largest bank, declined 5.2
percent to 284.65 pence. Credit Agricole, France’s biggest bank
by branches, slid 3.8 percent to 8.93 euros and Switzerland’s
Credit Suisse dropped 2.7 percent to 43.03 Swiss francs.  
 A  measure  of European banks posted the biggest drop among
the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, even as  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  agreed to pay $550 million and change its business
practices to settle a U.S. fraud lawsuit.  
 Utility shares recorded the third-largest slide on the
regional benchmark gauge, with  RWE  plunging 4.3 percent to 52.33
euros and E.ON sinking 4.9 percent to 21.78 euros. The German
government is proposing a tax on nuclear power plants that
applies each time a reactor receives new fuel rods designed to
generate 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) of revenue a year,
Finance Ministry spokesman  Michael Offer  told reporters in
Berlin today.  
 Fortum, Roche  
 Fortum Oyj  dropped 5.5 percent to 18.05 euros after the
Nordic region’s second-largest utility reported second-quarter
net income of 263 million euros. That missed the average analyst
estimate of 285 million euros, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Roche led pharmaceutical shares lower, falling 4.2 percent
to 144.5 francs. Avastin paired with chemotherapy treatments
didn’t help patients survive longer than use of the other drugs
alone, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff
review. FDA advisers will meet July 20 to evaluate the drug and
consider whether use in breast cancer should be continued,
expanded or halted.  
 Elan Corp. lost 2.3 percent to 3.85 euros after the Irish
drugmaker said it expects to pay $203.5 million to settle U.S.
government charges linked to the sale and marketing of the
Zonegran epilepsy treatment.  
 BP Gains  
 BP Plc  which has been battling to contain the worst U.S.
oil spill in history, advanced 1.3 percent to 407.15 pence. The
company said it’s “encouraged” after a pressure test that
halted the flow from its Gulf of Mexico well indicated no sign
of an oil leak after the first 17 hours.  
 Separately, BP may reach an agreement as soon as next week
to sell assets including half its stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay
field to Apache Corp. for $10 billion to $11 billion, according
to two people familiar with the matter.  
 Yara International ASA  climbed 5.2 percent to 222.5 kroner
after the largest publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker said
second-quarter net income was 3.72 billion kroner ($600
million), beating an analyst estimate of 3.61 billion kroner.  
 Rival K+S AG, Europe’s biggest potash producer, gained 2.6
percent to 38.90 euros.
      Rautaruukki Oyj  jumped 8.6 percent to 14.33 euros after
raising its 2010 sales forecast, saying revenue will grow 25
percent to 30 percent over last year. The previous target was
for 15 percent to 30 percent growth. Rautaruukki said it also
expects to post a pretax profit this year.
