             BlueBay Asset Management Plc , the
London-based manager of fixed-income funds, said assets under
management dropped 7 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter on a
fall in financial markets and foreign-exchange losses.  
 Funds shrank to $34.3 billion at June 30 from $37 billion
at the end of March, while inflows were $300 million in the
quarter, BlueBay said in a statement today. The stock fell 1.2
percent to 291.6 pence at the close in London.  
 “Inflows were very disappointing,” said  Nitin Arora , a
London-based analyst at Execution Nobel Ltd. who has a “hold”
rating on the stock. “BlueBay has highlighted that going
forward, inflows are likely to remain muted as the investment-
grade funds have hit the capacity.”  
 BlueBay has dropped 3.2 percent this year, outpacing the
2.7 percent decline in the 73-member FTSE  350 Financial Services
Index . Assets fell by $2.7 billion after the company moved euro-
denominated assets into U.S. dollars, BlueBay said. Performance
fees for the six months to the end of June were 8.4 million
pounds ($13 million).  
 “Raised levels of market volatility and reduced investor
risk appetite made the final quarter of the financial year a
more challenging one than its predecessors,” Chief Executive
Officer  Hugh Willis  said in the statement.  
 BlueBay said it expects full-year pretax profit to be about
50 million pounds, compared with 17.5 million pounds a year
earlier. The company will announce results for the year ended
June 30 on Sept. 16.
