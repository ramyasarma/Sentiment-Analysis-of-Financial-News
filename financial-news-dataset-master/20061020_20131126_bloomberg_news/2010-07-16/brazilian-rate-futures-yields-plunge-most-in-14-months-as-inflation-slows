             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts posted the biggest weekly drop since May 2009
after a report showed inflation is slowing more than economists
forecast.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 11.06 percent at 5:00 p.m. New York time. The yield
has dropped 26 basis points this week, the  biggest slide  since
the period ended May 15, 2009, and has slid 30 basis points from
a 16-month high at the end of June.  
 Traders are paring bets on central bank interest-rate
increases as the Getulio Vargas Foundation said inflation in the
month through July 10 as measured by its IGP-10 index fell to
0.05 percent from 1.30 percent in the previous month.  
 The plunge in futures yields puts traders’ year-end
forecast for the central bank’s  benchmark  Selic overnight rate
at 11.46 percent, down from 11.93 percent on July 8.  
 “The inflation watch in general has started to tame a
little bit, and today’s data only reinforces that,” said
 Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IDEAglobal in New York.  
 Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil’s largest bank by market
value, lowered its year-end forecasts for Brazil’s benchmark
lending rate for 2010 and 2011 to 11.5 percent and 12.75 percent
from 11.75 percent and 13 percent previously.  
 ‘Fragile Global Outlook’  
 A report this week showed Chinese industrial output rose
13.7 percent in June, less than the 15.1 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. China is Brazil’s biggest trading
partner.  
 “By no means are we seeing any significant risk that
growth is grinding to a halt, but a more fragile global outlook
in the U.S. and China is channeling into a less hawkish view of
Brazil rates,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Plc in New York.  
 The real weakened 1.1 percent to 1.7821 per dollar today
from 1.7629 yesterday. The currency dropped 1.5 percent this
week.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S.  consumer sentiment  decreased to 66.5 in July, the
lowest since August, and less than the most pessimistic forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “The consumer confidence numbers are affecting equities
and causing less risk confidence, which is overflowing into the
higher yielding currencies in Latin America,” Alvarez said.
