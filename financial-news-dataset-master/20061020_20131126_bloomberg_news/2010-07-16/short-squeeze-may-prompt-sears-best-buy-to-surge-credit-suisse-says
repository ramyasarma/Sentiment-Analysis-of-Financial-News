             Sears Holdings Corp. , the sixth
worst-performing stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during
the past six months, may surge with other heavily shorted
companies should a rally prompt bearish investors to cover their
bets, according to  Credit Suisse Group AG .  
 Undervalued stocks with high short interest such as Sears
and  Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer, could outperform in the near-term if the market
rallies because investors who bet against them will be forced to
buy the securities to cover their positions, Credit Suisse
analyst  Pankaj N. Patel  wrote in a note yesterday.  
 “If the market picks up in the coming weeks, the most
heavily shorted stocks may rise in response to a short
squeeze,” wrote Patel, who is based in New York. “Over the
long term, we view high short interest as a negative indicator,
with the highest short interest stocks underperforming over
time. However, there is possibility of short covering when the
market rises unexpectedly.”  
 Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them in the hope of
profiting by repurchasing the securities later at a lower price
and returning them to the holder. Short covering occurs when an
investor buys a security to close a short position or to return
a borrowed security. In a short squeeze, the lack of supply
forces prices upward and traders with short positions are forced
to buy the securities to cover their positions and limit their
losses. The surge of buying results in even higher prices.  
 Most-Shorted Stocks  
 Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, has
fallen 36 percent in the past six months. More than 25 percent
of the company’s shares available for trading, or float, were
sold short as of June 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That makes it the second most-shorted stock in the
benchmark index for U.S. equities.  
 Credit Suisse economists say there is no chance the U.S.
economy will fall into its second recession in three years,
indicating that investor fear of further declines in the stock
market isn’t justified. The S&P 500 has rebounded 7.2 percent
from a 10-month low on July 2 amid optimism about second-quarter
results. Analysts predict earnings in the S&P 500 grew 34
percent last quarter, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The  VIX , as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, reached a closing high this year of 45.79 on May
20 as an increase in U.S. jobless claims and the European credit
crisis caused concern among investors. The index measures the
cost of using options as insurance against S&P 500 declines.  
 “This high level of fear seems unwarranted, especially
considering the positive indicators present in the current macro
environment,” Patel wrote.  
 ‘Unloved’  
 The Zurich-based bank used high short interest, negative
analyst ratings, positive earnings guidance and cheap valuations
to pick “the most unloved and undervalued” stocks that are
likely to “outperform in the near-term as fear indicators
return to more normalized levels and markets advance,”
according to the report.  
 The list of stocks selected include  Lexmark International
Inc. , the second-largest U.S. printer maker, for-profit educator
 Corinthian Colleges Inc.  and Reynolds American Inc., the second-
largest U.S. tobacco company.  
 Sears stock is more difficult to borrow than the majority
of stocks in the S&P 500, according to Credit Suisse, which
added that harder-to-borrow stocks have a higher chance of a
short squeeze.
