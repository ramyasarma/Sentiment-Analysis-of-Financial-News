             Copper, down 9.4 percent this year,
may advance 15 percent if it closes at $6,792 a metric ton
within the next two weeks, according to Barclays Capital Plc.  
 The $6,792 closing would complete a head and shoulders
“basing pattern,” spurring a “more bullish bias” and a move
toward $7,800, Barclays Capital analyst MacNeil Curry in New
York said in a report yesterday.  
 The attached chart shows the head-and-shoulders basing
pattern, which occurs when prices form three consecutive
troughs, the lowest being the middle one.  
 The metal fell 0.7 percent to $6,680 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange yesterday on speculation that slowing
economic expansion in China will add to risks for the global
economy.  
 Stockpiles  monitored by the LME are down 15 percent this
year on higher demand and are headed for the first annual drop
since 2004. Demand is forecast to increase 6.1 percent to 18.9
million tons this year, according to a report by Barclays on
June 10. Inventories fell for a 20th session yesterday to
427,725 tons, the lowest level since Nov. 23.
