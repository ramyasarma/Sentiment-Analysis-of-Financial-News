             Hog futures rose to a one-week high
on signs that unusually hot weather in the U.S. Midwest is
making the animals lighter at slaughter, tightening pork
supplies. Cattle prices also gained.  
 Hogs sold yesterday to pork processors weighed 4.44 pounds
(2 kilograms) less on average than the same day last month, U.S.
government data show. In Iowa, the biggest hog-raising state, 
temperatures  were 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal last
month, the 33rd warmest June in 138 years of record-keeping,
according to the state Department of Agriculture.  
 “With this kind of heat, hog weights are coming down”
because the animals tend to eat less, said  Dick Quiter , a broker
for McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago. Livestock producers
also “aren’t in a big hurry to move hogs, so there is less
supply,” he said.  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.375 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 75.7 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching 76.5 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since July 9. Prices rose 0.8 percent for
the week, the second straight gain.  
 The average weight at slaughter yesterday was 265.99 pounds
per hog, down from 270.43 pounds a year earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show.  
 Hog futures also got a boost from speculation that a weaker
dollar will boost demand for U.S. pork.  
 Dollar Declines  
 The  dollar  fell to a 10-week low against a basket of six
major currencies. In May, U.S. pork exports jumped 18 percent
from a year earlier, according to the most-recent government
data.  
 “There is talk of a possible increase in exports, but
that’s all just speculation,” said  Tom Cawthorne , the director
of hog marketing at commodity broker R.J. O’Brien & Associates
in Chicago.  
 U.S. pork exports totaled 362.82 million pounds in May,
compared with 306.9 million pounds a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.05 cent to
93.625 cents a pound in Chicago, the fourth straight gain.
Prices rallied 2.4 percent for the week, the most since March.
Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slipped 0.275 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $1.131 a pound.
