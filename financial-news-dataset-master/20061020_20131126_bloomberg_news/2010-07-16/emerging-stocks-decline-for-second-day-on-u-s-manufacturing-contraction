             Emerging-market stocks fell for a
second day as a slump in U.S. consumer confidence raised doubts
over the global recovery and sent oil and metal prices tumbling.  
 Energy and financial shares led declines and the Brazilian
real fell after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to its lowest
level since August 2009, sliding to 66.5 from 76 in June.  
 The index, which missed even the most pessimistic of
analysts’ forecasts, hit the prices for oil and metals, key
exports for developing economies including Russia and Brazil.
The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  declined 0.8 percent to 949.17
as of 11:51 a.m. in New York, leaving the measure 0.3 percent
down for the week.  
 Weak U.S. economic data is “likely to continue to be a
drag for the next couple of months, through the summer,” said
 Nick Chamie , global head of emerging-market research at RBC
Capital Markets in Toronto. “Being highly sensitive to global
growth dynamics, emerging markets are likely to feel this.”  
 Russian’s  Micex  Index of 30 stocks declined 0.9 percent to
1,327.43, its lowest level for a week, with the country’s
largest lender OAO Sberbank and OAO Gazprom, its state-run gas
producer, losing 2.1 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.  
 Oil prices fell 1.3 percent to $75.64 in New York and
copper for three-month delivery declined 2.8 percent to
$6,490.25 a metric ton.  
 Weaker commodity prices sapped stocks in Brazil, where the
 Bovespa  Index lost 1.3 percent to 62,696.66. Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Brazil’s largest bank by market value, slid 2.2
percent, its biggest decline in 1 1/2 weeks, and state-owned oil
producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA fell 1 percent.  
 Real, Zloty  
 Brazil’s currency weakened 1.3 percent to 1.7866 per
dollar, and Russia’s ruble appreciated 0.2 percent to 30.41
against the dollar. The Polish zloty slumped 0.9 percent to
4.1089 per euro and the Colombian peso fell the most in a week
against the dollar.  
 Ukraine’s 6.75 percent Eurobond due 2017 rose after the
government dropped plans for its first new Eurobond since 2007,
sending the yield down 42 basis points to 7.42 percent. The
bond’s 2.4 percent rally to 96.255 was its biggest gain since
May.  
 Ukraine struck a second loan agreement with the
International Monetary Fund and abandoned a Eurobond sale after
investors sought yields of more than 9 percent, Deputy Prime
Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said in an interview.  
 Chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix Semiconductor
Inc. dropped more than 2 percent, pulling South Korea’s Kospi
Index down 0.7 percent to 1,738.45, after Google Inc. reported
worse-than-expected earnings.  
 Shanghai Composite Index was unchanged at 2,424.271 and the
Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index rose 0.3 percent to
17,955.82.
