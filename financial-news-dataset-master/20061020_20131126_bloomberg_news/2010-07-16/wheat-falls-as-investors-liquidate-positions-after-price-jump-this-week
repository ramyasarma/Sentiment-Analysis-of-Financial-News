             Wheat fell the most in a week on
speculation that investors are liquidating positions after
prices jumped to the highest level since November.  
 Before today, wheat surged 24 percent this month, rising 11
percent in the previous three sessions alone on reports that a
drought in Russia, the fourth-biggest exporter of the grain,
will curb production. Investors may be selling on concern that
rain may fall this weekend in Russia and the European Union,
which also has been parched.  
 “It doesn’t need a reason to go lower when it’s this
overbought,” said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds
Marketing and Investments in Hays, Kansas. “If you’ve been long
for two weeks or a week, you’ve made so much money, why would
you risk holding it over the weekend? Weather markets are brutal
on Monday. They’ll sleep better taking money off the table.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 9.25 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $5.87 a bushel at 10:02 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price touched $5.985 a bushel,
the highest level since Nov. 23.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
