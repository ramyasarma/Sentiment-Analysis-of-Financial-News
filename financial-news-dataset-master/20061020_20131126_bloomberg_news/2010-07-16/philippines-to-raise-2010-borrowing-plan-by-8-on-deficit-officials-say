             The Philippines will increase its
borrowing plan for this year by 8 percent to fund a record
 budget deficit , according to two government officials.  
 The government will raise 766.4 billion pesos ($16.6
billion) in 2010, compared with a previous target of 708.6
billion pesos, said the officials, who declined to be identified
as the information isn’t yet public. Overseas debt issuance will
be 254.8 billion pesos, from an original plan of 220.5 billion
pesos, they said. Domestic sales will be 511.6 billion pesos,
compared with 488.1 billion pesos.  
 President  Benigno Aquino , who took office on June 30,
pledged to boost spending on education, health care and social
services to fight poverty and attain faster growth. His economic
managers last week widened this year’s budget deficit estimate
to 325 billion pesos, compared with an all-time high of 298.5
billion pesos in 2009.  
 “I’m still overweight the Philippine bond market,” said
 Kenneth Akintewe , a Singapore-based investment manager at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees $259 billion
globally. “Monetary policy will be on hold for an extended
period of time, which is bond positive. While the fiscal
backdrop remains bond negative, it doesn’t negate the
possibility that bonds could stay moderately well supported.”  
 Bonds Rise  
 Philippine local-currency bonds headed for a second weekly
gain after the central bank kept interest rates unchanged and
lowered its inflation forecast for this year and next.  
 Six-year yields dropped to a record low yesterday after
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas left the overnight borrowing rate at
4 percent for a ninth meeting, as expected by economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. “ Uncertainty  over the strength and
pace” of global growth supported the decision, the central bank
said.  
 Yields “can still go lower,” said  Marcelo Ayes , senior
vice president for treasury at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
Manila. “Investing between stocks and bonds, bonds are safer
and will appreciate during a slowdown, especially if there’s low
inflation.”  
 The yield on the 9.125 percent note due September 2016 fell
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 6.40 percent at
2:30 p.m. in Manila, from 6.50 percent last week, according to
Tradition Financial Services. The yield reached 6.325 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since the debt was sold in 2006.  
 Peso Debt  
 Aquino’s administration will favor peso-denominated debt to
avoid exchange-rate risk, Finance Secretary  Cesar Purisima  said
on July 7.  
 The Philippines plans to sell peso-denominated bonds to
global investors this year and that will be counted as overseas
borrowing, Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said on July 8. There are no
plans to sell more foreign-currency debt, Tan said. At least 20
billion pesos of securities will be targeted at individual
investors this quarter, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said
this month.  
 The nation sold $1.5 billion of dollar bonds and 100
billion yen ($1.15 billion) of notes in the first quarter. It
sold $500 million worth of dollar- and euro-denominated debt to
individuals in April.
