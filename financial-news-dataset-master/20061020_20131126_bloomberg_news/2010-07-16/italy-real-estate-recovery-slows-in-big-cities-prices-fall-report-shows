             Italy’s real-estate market recovery
is struggling to gather pace as prices remain below pre-crisis
levels and are unlikely to rise until the end of next year,
research institute  Nomisma  said.  
 The number of homes sold in the first half of 2010 remained
30 percent lower than before the financial crisis began in 2008,
the Bologna-based institute said in a report today. In the six
months through June, prices fell 1.8 percent from the second
half of 2009, according to the study based on a survey of the 13
biggest cities in Italy.  
 “Abroad, the market recovery has been felt for some months
now, with investments resuming and prices picking up,” Nomisma
said. “The Italian market still appears to be far from a firm
recovery in terms of both prices and sales.”  
 Italian  business  and  consumer confidence  fell in June as
households grew more pessimistic amid the highest  jobless rate 
in almost six years. Nomisma said the decline in confidence had
ended a temporary pickup in late 2009, curbing the real-estate
market’s rebound.
