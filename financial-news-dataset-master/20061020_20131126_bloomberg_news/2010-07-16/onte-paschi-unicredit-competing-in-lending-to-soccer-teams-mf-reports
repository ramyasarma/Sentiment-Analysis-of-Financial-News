             Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  is
competing with  UniCredit SpA  in lending Italy’s top soccer teams
funds they will repay with proceeds from television broadcasting
rights,  Milano Finanza  reported, without citing anyone  
 UniCredit recently informed the Serie A league that it
would make up to 1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion) available to
the top 20 teams, though some of them had already agreed to get
financing from Monte Paschi, MF said.
