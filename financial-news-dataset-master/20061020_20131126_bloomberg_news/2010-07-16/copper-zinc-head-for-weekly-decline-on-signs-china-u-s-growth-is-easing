             Copper declined, heading for a
weekly drop, on signs that economic growth is slowing in China
and the U.S., the world’s two largest consumers of the metal.  
 Copper for three-month delivery lost 0.3 percent to $6,660
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 2:38 p.m. in
Shanghai, a 1.5 percent loss this week. Zinc rose 1.3 percent to
$1,832 a ton, narrowing this week’s loss to 3.8 percent.  
 China’s  economic growth  eased to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter and industrial production slowed more than forecast in
June. The U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed its growth forecast and
the country’s manufacturing contracted in June by the most in a
year. Copper, used in construction and home appliances, had its
first quarterly loss since 2008 in the April-to-June period on
concerns that the global economic recovery was weakening.  
 “Equities responded poorly to the economic data, damping
sentiment for metal investors, who have been struggling for a
direction,” Zhang Hao, an analyst at Citic Newedge Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai today.  
 Declines in U.S. equities and the dollar are pulling metals
in opposite directions and “locking the market in a narrow
trading range that’s expected to stay for one or two more
weeks”, Zhang said.  
 The  Dollar Index , a six-currency gauge of the dollar’s
value, was headed for a sixth weekly drop. Commodities, priced
in the dollar, usually move counter to the currency.  
 Still, China and India’s construction industries will drive
copper and zinc prices higher this year, said  Thomas Findley ,
chief executive officer of Canadian exploration company Rio
Cristal Zinc Resources Corp.  
 Shrinking Inventory  
 Copper inventories monitored by the LME have shrunk 15
percent this year. Cancelled warrants, or metal earmarked for
delivery, jumped 11 percent yesterday.  
 “Recent declines in LME stockpiles often occurred in Asian
warehouses, implying China may be increasing purchases,”  Tan Wentao , an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said from Shanghai.  
 Copper for October delivery in Shanghai added as much as
0.7 percent to 53,260 yuan ($7,865) a ton and last traded at
53,130 yuan. Aluminum in London rose 0.2 percent to $2,019 a ton,
while nickel dropped 0.4 percent to $19,320 a ton. Lead advanced
0.6 percent to $1,809 a ton and tin rose 0.8 percent to $18,080
a ton as of 3 p.m. in Shanghai.
