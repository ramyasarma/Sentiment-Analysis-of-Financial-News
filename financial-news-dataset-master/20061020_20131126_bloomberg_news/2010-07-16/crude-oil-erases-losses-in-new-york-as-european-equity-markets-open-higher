             Crude oil is heading for a second
weekly gain as advancing equity markets reinforced expectations
that fuel demand will increase and the dollar weakened against
the euro, making oil cheaper for European investors.  
 Reports from the International Energy Agency and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast that this
year’s demand recovery will continue into 2011. Crude fell
earlier today as manufacturing in New York and Pennsylvania
dropped, part of a nationwide  decline  in factory production of
0.4 percent in June.  
 “We’re having a period of mixed signals,”  Thorbjoern Bak Jensen , an analyst at Global Risk Management in Middelfart,
Denmark. “The stimulus packages are running out. But the
fundamentals and the financials are still supportive, so I think
we could test the $80 mark in a short while.”  
 Crude for August delivery was unchanged at $76.62 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:24 a.m. London time.
The contract had risen as high as $77.15 a barrel and fallen as
low as $76.27. Brent crude for September settlement slipped 5
cent to $76.04 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 The euro traded at $1.2978 after weakening to $1.2890.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that its
general economic index fell to 5.1 in July from 19.6 the prior
month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index declined to 5.1 this month, the lowest level
since August 2009, from 8 in June.  
 ‘Slowdown in Growth’  
 “The economic news is signaling a slowdown in growth,”
said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at Purvin & Gertz Inc. in
Singapore. “It’s creating a view that oil pricing in the high
$70’s might be a little stronger than it should be.”  
 Oil is poised for a 0.7 percent gain for the week, after
climbing 5.5 percent last week.  
 Crude may fall next week after government reports signaled
that the U.S. economic recovery will slow, reducing fuel demand,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Thirteen of 33 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 23. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week, 53 percent of analysts forecast a gain.
economies such as China and India.  
 Worldwide crude oil consumption will increase by 1.05
million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, next year to average
86.41 million barrels a day, OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat
said yesterday in its first assessment for 2011. The Paris-based
IEA forecast that oil usage will advance 1.3 million barrels, or
1.6 percent, to 87.8 million a day in 2011.
