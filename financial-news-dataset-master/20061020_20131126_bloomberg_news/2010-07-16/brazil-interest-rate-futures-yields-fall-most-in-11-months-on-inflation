             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts headed to the biggest weekly drop since
August after a report showed inflation is slowing more than
economists expected.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 11.08 percent at 1:22 p.m. New York time. The yield
has declined 24 basis points this week, the  biggest drop  since
the period ended Aug. 14, and has slid 28 basis points from a
16-month high at the end of June.  
 Traders are paring bets on central bank interest-rate
increases as the Getulio Vargas Foundation said inflation in
the month through July 10 as measured by its IGP-10 index fell
to 0.05 percent from 1.30 percent in the previous month.  
 The plunge in futures yields puts traders’ year-end
forecast for the central bank’s  benchmark  Selic overnight rate
at 11.47 percent, down from 11.93 percent on July 8, and below
the consensus economist forecast of 12 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “The inflation watch in general has started to tame a
little bit, and today’s data only reinforces that,” said
 Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IDEAglobal in New York.  
 A report this week showed Chinese industrial output rose
13.7 percent in June, less than the 15.1 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. China is Brazil’s biggest trading
partner.  
 ‘Fragile Global Outlook’  
 “By no means are we seeing any significant risk that
growth is grinding to a halt, but a more fragile global outlook
in the U.S. and China is channeling into a less hawkish view of
Brazil rates,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Plc in New York.  
 The real weakened 1.2 percent to 1.7834 per dollar, from
1.7629 yesterday. The currency has dropped 1.6 percent this
week.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S.  consumer sentiment  decreased to 66.5 in July, the
lowest since August, and less than the most pessimistic forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “The consumer confidence numbers are affecting equities
and causing less risk confidence, which is overflowing into the
higher yielding currencies in Latin America,” Alvarez said.
