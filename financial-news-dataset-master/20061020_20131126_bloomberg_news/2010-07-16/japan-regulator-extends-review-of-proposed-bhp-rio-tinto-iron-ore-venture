             Japan’s competition regulator
extended its antitrust review of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto
Group’s proposed venture involving their Australian iron ore
operations.  
 The venture is subject to a secondary antitrust review, the
Japan Fair Trade Commission said today in a statement on its
website.  
 An initial 30-day review ended today. The regulator will
make a decision from the secondary review within 90 days after
receiving necessary documents.  
 Rio and BHP, the second- and third-largest iron ore
exporters, propose combining Australian operations in a 50-50
venture to save at least $10 billion in costs. European and
Asian steelmakers oppose the plan on concerns about a lack of
competition in the iron ore market.
