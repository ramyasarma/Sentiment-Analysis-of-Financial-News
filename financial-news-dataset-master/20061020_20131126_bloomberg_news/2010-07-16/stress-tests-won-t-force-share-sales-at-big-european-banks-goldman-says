             Stress tests of European banks
aren’t likely to force major publicly listed lenders to bolster
their capital by selling new shares, analysts at  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  said.  
 “We do not expect large listed European banks to raise
equity as a result of the stress tests,” London-based Goldman
Sachs analysts, including  Jernej Omahen  and  Frederik Thomasen ,
wrote in a report to clients dated today.  
 European Union  regulators  are examining the strength of
banks as they seek to reassure investors about the institutions’
resilience to potential losses as the debt crisis pummels the
bonds of Greece, Spain and Portugal. The stress tests include a
total of 91 of the biggest banks, representing 65 percent of the
European industry. The results are scheduled for partial
publication on July 23.  
 Assuming a 6 percent Tier 1 hurdle rate, “it should not be
surprising that most banks participating in the stress test
should show favorable results,” the analysts wrote. “This
includes many of the public-sector institutions.”  
 Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on Spain’s Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA to “buy” from “neutral” in the
report, saying “the resilience provided by its international
operations is underappreciated.”
