             The rand gained, poised for a second
straight weekly advance, as a weaker dollar spurred purchases of
higher-yield assets and investors speculated a Japanese takeover
of Dimension Data Plc will boost South Africa’s currency.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 7.5410 per
dollar and traded at 7.5347 by 1:33 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
close of 7.5852 yesterday. The move extended the rand’s weekly
climb to 0.9 percent.  
 The dollar has depreciated for the past four days against
the euro to a two-month low of 1.2993. Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp.’s $3.2 billion acquisition of Dimension Data Plc
is “rand positive,”  John Cairns , head of foreign-exchange
research at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, wrote in a
client note today. Dimension Data, known as Didata, estimates
half of the $3.2 billion will flow to South Africa.  
 “The dollar has weakened quite a bit and that’s supportive
of the rand because investors would rather hold alternative
currencies or assets,” said  Ian Cruickshanks , head of research
at Nedbank Treasury in Johannesburg. “Inflows from the Didata
deal are also positive but at the moment it’s having a limited
impact on the rand because deal flow won’t be immediate.”  
 Interest rates in the U.S. of 0.25 percent make it
attractive to borrow in dollars and invest the proceeds in
markets or assets that offer higher returns. South Africa’s
benchmark interest rate is 6.5 percent and its bonds yield as
much as 8.94 percent.  
 “It costs you almost nothing to borrow in dollars and get
a fat return in rand,” said Cruickshanks. “The bond market
especially has attracted a lot of foreign money this year.”  
 Bonds  
 Foreign investors have been net purchasers of more than 40
billion rand ($5.3 billion) of South African bonds this year,
according to data from the JSE Ltd., which runs the country’s
exchanges.  
 Government bonds in South Africa snapped two days of
declines, with benchmark 13.5 percent security due September
2015 gaining 8 cents to 124.03 rand. The yield on the bond
declined 2 basis points to 7.74 percent.  
 Investors increased bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts for cash in one month  declined 1 basis
point to 6.41 percent.
