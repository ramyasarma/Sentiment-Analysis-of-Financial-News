             Precision Air Services Ltd., a
Tanzanian airline, said it plans to sell 55 million shares in an
initial public offering to fund the purchase of aircraft and the
development of new routes.  
 An adviser on the share sale will be appointed in the last
week of this month, the company said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. It didn’t say

reduced to 34.6 percent, from 51 percent, while  Kenya Airways
Ltd. ’s 49 percent interest will fall to 34.2 percent, it said.
