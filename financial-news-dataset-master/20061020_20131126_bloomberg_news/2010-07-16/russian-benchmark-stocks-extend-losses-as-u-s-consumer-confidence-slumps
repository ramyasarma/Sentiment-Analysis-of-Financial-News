             Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index fell
to its lowest in a week after oil slid and a drop in U.S.
consumer confidence curbed appetite for riskier assets.  
 OAO Rosneft , the country’s largest oil producer, slipped
1.8 percent.  OAO Sberbank  and  VTB Group , the nation’s two
biggest banks, declined more than 2 percent. The  Micex Index  of
30 stocks retreated for a third day, losing 0.9 percent to
1,327.55 at the close in Moscow trading.  
 Oil, Russia’s chief export, dropped 1.2 percent to $75.67
in New York after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to 66.5 in July
from 76 a month earlier. The gauge was projected to fall to 74,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
62 economists.  
 Banks in Russia extended declines after Bank of America
Corp. and Citigroup Inc. posted lower-than-estimated revenues.
VTB dropped by the most in more than two weeks, declining 3
percent to 7.63 kopeks.  
 “Russian blue-chip banks got hit as a knee-jerk reaction
to U.S. banks,”  Luis Saenz , a London-based director of
international sales at brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd., wrote
in an e-mailed comment.
