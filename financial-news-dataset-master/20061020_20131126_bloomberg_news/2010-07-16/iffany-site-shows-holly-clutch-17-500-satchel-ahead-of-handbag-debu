             Tiffany & Co.  showed off its first
handbag collection in 20 years, including a $17,500 glazed-
crocodile “Manhattan” satchel, on the Web today as part of a
strategy to extend its brand beyond jewelry.  
 The full  collection  appeared on the website following
piecemeal information released in recent months. Many of the
handbags will be priced at $1,000 to $2,000, said  Mark Aaron , a
spokesman for the New York-based jeweler. He declined to provide
sales  projections .  
 Tiffany’s 12 largest U.S. stores will begin selling the
bags, made of materials like suede, snakeskin and natural-grain
calf, in September. The line may generate sales of “highly
profitable” wallets and small leather accessories around the
world, Chief Financial Officer  James Fernandez  said last month.
Tiffany previously sold leather goods about two decades ago.  
 “A blue box from Tiffany is instantly credible as a
gift,” said  Steven Dennis , a former executive at  Neiman Marcus
Group Inc.  and president of retail adviser SageBerry Consulting
LLC in Dallas. “Smaller leather goods, those are very giftable
categories.”  
 Handbags may pose a challenge since the company isn’t
known as a fashion or a leather-goods brand, and shoppers may
seek out a known label, such as Hermes, if they’re going to
spend that kind of money, he said in a telephone interview.  
 Tiffany shares fell $1.61, or 4 percent, to $39.18 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares
have dropped 8.9 percent this year.  
 Other Accessories  
 The collection of day and evening handbags for women;
briefcases and bags for men; and accessories for both, was
designed by Richard Lambertson and John Truex, who joined
Tiffany about a year ago. Tiffany said in April that prices
might range from $395 to $16,500 for women, and $95 to $1,395
for men.  
 The accessories include wallets, key holders, business card
holders, and luggage tags priced at $100 to $120, Fernandez said
at a June 17 investors’ conference.  
 “They’re very high-margin, very  profitable  products,” he
said. “The handbag collection gives support to that.”  
 Tiffany , the world’s second-largest luxury jewelry
retailer, over time will convert space once used for china and
crystal -- which is “just not that  profitable ” -- for the
leather goods, Fernandez said in June.  
 “The handbag collection, it’s probably more flagship-
store-oriented around the world, where we would have a much
broader kind of customer group,” Fernandez said. “But the
leather accessories will be probably in every store around the
world, and I think they’ll provide a great, great opportunity.”  
 Holly Golightly  
 The collection includes a $595 “Holly” clutch, a possible
reference to Holly Golightly, the character in  Truman Capote ’s
novella “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” Golightly was portrayed by
 Audrey Hepburn  in the 1961 film of the same name.  
 The handbags come in rich shades such as Tiffany blue,
onyx, garnet and red, according to the website. The evening bags
have Tiffany jewelry-inspired touches like a chunky beaded wrist
chain and longer crystal chains inspired by diamond necklaces.
Items also have Tiffany blue leather linings, as well as touches
of that color enamel on their hardware.  
 Lambertson and Truex also created the TRT, or Tiffany
reversible tote, which is suede on one side and metallic leather
on the other, for $395 to $595. Tiffany bought their bankrupt
Lambertson Truex leather-goods brand from Samsonite Corp. for an
undisclosed price in mid-2009. Lambertson Truex filed for
bankruptcy protection in March of that year.  
 The jeweler, which operated 221 stores and boutiques
worldwide as of April 30, diversified into Tiffany-branded
handbags and scarves in the 1980s. It discontinued the items in
the early 1990s.
