             Richards Bay Coal Terminal failed to
end a strike now in its fifth day during talks yesterday, a
South African Trade and Allied Workers’ Union official said.  
 RBCT is offering a three-year deal while workers want a
one-year pact, the union’s provincial treasurer Musa Makhanya
said by mobile phone today. The union is willing to accept
RBCT’s offer of a 9.5 percent increase this year, he said,
adding about 266 staff members are on strike.
