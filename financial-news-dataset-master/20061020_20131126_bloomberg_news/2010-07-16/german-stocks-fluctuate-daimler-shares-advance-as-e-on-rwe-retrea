             German stocks  retreated for the
second straight day, leading the benchmark  DAX Index  to a weekly
fall, after a report showed confidence among U.S. consumers
slumped to the lowest level in a year.  
 E.ON AG  and  RWE AG , Germany’s largest utilities, fell more
than 4 percent after the government proposed higher taxes on
nuclear power plant operators.  Deutsche Bank AG  declined 3.1
perecent as financial stocks tumbled.  K+S AG , the Kassel,
Germany-based potash producer, rose 2.6 percent after fertilizer
maker  Yara International ASA  reported better-than-estimated
profit.  
 The  DAX  fell 109.09, or 1.8 percent, to 6,040.27 at the
close of trading in Frankfurt, bringing its weekly decline to
0.4 percent. The gauge has still climbed 5.7 percent since the
European Union’s May 10 unveiling of a 750 billion euro ($969.8
billion) loan package aimed at stopping the euro region’s
weakest members from defaulting. The broader  HDAX Index  fell 1.8
percent today.  
 Stocks dropped as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment slumped to
66.5, the lowest since August 2009, from 76 in June, signaling
the biggest part of the world’s largest economy losing momentum.  
 “This is another piece of the jigsaw which is stoking
fears of another decline into recession,” said  Michael Koehler ,
the head of strategy at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Mainz,
Germany.  
 E.ON AG  and  RWE AG , Germany’s biggest utilities, lost 4.9
percent to 21.78 euros and 4.3 percent to 52.33 euros,
respectively. Germany’s planned tax on utilities that run
nuclear power plants would levy 220 euros per gram of plutonium
or uranium when a reactor is refueled, Handelsblatt reported,
citing a government discussion paper.  
 Deutsche Bank fell 3.1 percent to 47.67 euros, its biggest
decline in more than two weeks. Commerzbank fell 2.4 percent to
6.23 euros.  
 K+S, the world’s second-biggest manufacturer of potash,
which is used in fertilizers, rallied 2.6 percent to 38.90
euros. Yara, the largest publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer
maker, said second-quarter profit more than tripled, beating
analysts’ estimates.
