             Crude oil recovered from earlier
losses as European equity markets opened higher and the euro
pared its decline against the dollar.  
 Crude for August delivery was up 8 cents at $76.70 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 8:14 a.m. London time
after falling as low as $76.27. The euro traded at $1.2923 after
slipping to $1.2890, and the Europe Stoxx 600 index was up 0.4
percent.  
 Futures had fallen earlier after reports of a slowdown in
U.S. manufacturing raised concern fuel demand will falter in the
world’s biggest energy user. Oil is poised for a 0.8 percent
gain for the week, after climbing 5.5 percent last week.  
 Crude may fall next week after government reports signaled
that the U.S. economic recovery will slow, reducing fuel demand,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Thirteen of 33 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 23. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week, 53 percent of analysts forecast a gain.
