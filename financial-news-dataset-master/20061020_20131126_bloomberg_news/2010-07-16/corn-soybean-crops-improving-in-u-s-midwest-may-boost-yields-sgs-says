             Corn  and  soybean  crops in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest grower and exporter, are in good or
excellent condition and may produce above-average yields this
year, according to a survey of five Midwest states by  SGS SA .  
 Crops are growing rapidly with above-normal temperatures,
rain and abundant soil moisture from Brookings, South Dakota, to
Carlyle, Illinois,  SGS Crop Services  said today in a report to
clients. Most of the corn has already pollinated, a growth stage
that determines the number of viable kernels, while pest and
disease damage has been light, the researcher said.  
 “Early corn is reaching the point where wet, dry or hot
conditions have a decreasing affect on yield,” Geneva-based SGS
said in the report. “Growers are optimistic and are expecting
average to better-than-average yields.”  
 Too much rain in eastern Iowa has slowed application of
crop-protection chemicals, and soil moisture is declining near
Rockville, Indiana, SGS said in its biweekly report.  
 The researcher said it will publish forecasts of the U.S.
corn and soybean harvests in early August, before the U.S.
Department of Agriculture issues its first production estimates
based on field and farmer surveys on Aug. 12.
