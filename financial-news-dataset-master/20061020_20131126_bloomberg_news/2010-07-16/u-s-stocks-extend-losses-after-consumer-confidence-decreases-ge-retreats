             U.S. stocks tumbled after a gauge of
consumer confidence trailed economists’ forecasts, extending
early declines triggered by lower-than-estimated revenue at
General Electric Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 1.6 percent to
1,078.57 at 9:58 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average retreated 145.92 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,213.39.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index
of consumer sentiment fell to 66.5 in July from 76 a month
earlier. The gauge was projected to fall to 74, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 62 economists.
