             Iraq’s plans to expand its oil
pipelines and other export facilities will cost $50 billion, the
Middle East Economic Survey reported today, without saying where
it got the information.  
 As part of this program, the country intends to build a
pipeline that would carry heavy oil from the Majnoun, East
Baghdad, Qayara and Najma fields to Turkey and to rebuild an
existing export network to Syria, according to MEES.  
 International oil companies who signed deals with Iraq will
meet with their local partners on July 18-19 in Baghdad to
discuss pipeline construction and water injection, MEES said.
