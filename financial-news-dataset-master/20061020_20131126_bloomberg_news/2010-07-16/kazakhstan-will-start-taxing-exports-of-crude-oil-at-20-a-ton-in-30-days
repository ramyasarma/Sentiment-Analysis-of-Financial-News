             Kazakhstan will start taxing oil
exports at $20 a metric ton ($2.73 a barrel) in 30 days as it
seeks to boost its share of the country’s oil wealth.  
 The largest oil producer in Central Asia won’t tax
companies that operate under production-sharing agreements and
have an exemption clause, according to a  resolution  published in
the government’s official Kazakhstanskaya Pravda today. Others
that are exempt from custom duties and don’t pay royalties are
also excluded.  
 Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world’s proven oil
reserves according to BP Plc, began taxing crude exports in May
2008, then cut the duty to zero from $139.79 a metric ton in
January 2009. The earlier tax applied to about 40 producers
including Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV, in which BG Group
Plc and Eni SpA hold stakes, and KazMunaiGas Exploration
Production.  
 Chevron Corp.’s largest venture in the country will pay the
duty, the government said July 13. TengizChevroil LLP was exempt
from the earlier duty.  
 The reintroduction of the duty marks another step in the
government’s campaign to boost its share of revenue from the
country’s most valuable export. TengizChevroil and Karachaganak
together accounted for about 45 percent of Kazakhstan’s 76.4
million tons of oil output last year.  
 Karachaganak Petroleum Operating said July 13 that it
should be exempted from export duties because of “tax
stabilization provisions” within its production sharing
agreement.
