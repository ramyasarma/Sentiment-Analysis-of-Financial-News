             Mountain man Kit Carson was small --
just 5 feet 4 inches in his boots -- but fearless enough to take
on the hulking French-Canadian drunk Joseph Chouinard. They
charged each other on horseback, and in the ensuing gunfight,
Carson shot and disabled the “great bully of the mountains.”  
 Born in Kentucky, Carson quit school at age 8 when his
father died. Apprenticed to a saddler at 14, he soon ran away to
find his fortune in the West as a trapper, explorer, guide and
soldier.  
 Mountain men often married local American Indians. Adding
to the hostility between Chouinard and Carson was that both were
wooing the lovely Arapaho maiden Singing Grass.  
 After defeating his rival, Carson won her hand in marriage
by paying her father, Running Around, three mules and a gun.  
 These exploits made Kit Carson famous in his own time, and
he starred in such dime novels as “The Fighting Trapper: Kit
Carson to the Rescue.” Later, his enduring legend sold comic
books, films and television shows.  
 I spoke with  Eric Jay Dolin , author of “ Fur, Fortune and
Empire ” (Norton), on the following topics:  
 1. Pelts Save the Pilgrims  
 2. Guns & Alcohol  
 3. Raucous Fur Rendezvous  
 4. Death Knell for the Mountain Men  
 5. Contemporary Fur Trading
