             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  sided
with a Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. creditor group led by hedge
fund Paulson & Co. in pressing the defunct firm to share
information with creditors trying to assess its proposed payment
plan.  
 BNY Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, said it holds
for customers more than $700 million in municipal bonds issued
by Lehman Brothers Commodity Services, making it the unit’s
single largest creditor, the New York-based bank said in a court
filing yesterday. Lehman turned down the trustee’s offer to sign
a confidentiality agreement so it could get information about
intercompany transactions that could increase the payout for BNY
Mellon’s customers from the 26.8 cents on the dollar estimated
by Lehman, it said.  
 Lehman’s need “to maintain control” over the plan “must
be balanced with the valid needs of appropriate creditor
representatives to obtain information that would allow them to
adequately assess the plan” and advise clients how to act on
it, the bank said in the filing.  
 The bond trustee said it didn’t support the other aims of
the Paulson group, which wanted Lehman to pay all creditors the
same amount even if they held claims against one of Lehman’s
healthier units.
