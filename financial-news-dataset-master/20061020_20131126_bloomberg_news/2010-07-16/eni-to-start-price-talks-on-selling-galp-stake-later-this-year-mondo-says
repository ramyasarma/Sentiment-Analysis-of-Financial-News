             Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest energy
company, will start price negotiations to sell its 33 percent
stake in Portugal’s Galp Energia SGPS SA in the “autumn,” Il
Mondo reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA of Brazil is most likely to buy
Eni’s stake in Galp, the weekly said.
