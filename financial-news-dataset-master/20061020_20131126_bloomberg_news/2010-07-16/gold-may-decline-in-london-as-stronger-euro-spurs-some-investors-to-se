             Gold may decline in New York as a
strengthening euro prompts sales by some investors who bought
bullion as an alternative asset to the currency.  
 The dollar slid to a nine-week low against the euro after
reports yesterday showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in June
by the most in a year and producer prices fell. U.S. reports may
today show household sentiment deteriorated and consumer prices
fell. Gold priced in euros today slipped to an eight-week low.  
 “Investors’ trust in the euro currency is back,” said
 Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “Previous gold safe-haven buyers,
mostly Europeans due to euro fears, are reconsidering their gold
investments as gold prices in euro terms are declining.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery lost $3.70, or 0.3
percent, to $1,204.60 an ounce at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are down 0.4 percent this week. Gold for immediate
delivery in London was 0.3 percent lower at $1,204.75.  
 Gold gained with the dollar in the previous three quarters
as the euro slumped 16 percent in the period against the
greenback. Bullion futures climbed to a record $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21 as investors sought to protect their wealth
against the debt crisis in Greece and other European nations
struggling to repay debt, and on concern that the global
recovery may slow.  
 Lower ‘Fixing’  
 Bullion fell to $1,204.75 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,208 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The dollar
slipped as much as 0.4 percent against the euro today. Gold
typically moves inversely to the U.S. currency.  
 Sixteen of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said that bullion will climb next
week. Three forecast lower prices and five were neutral.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, declined 0.61 metric ton to 1,314.21
tons yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global
holdings of the metal by ETFs fell 0.7 ton from a record to
2,075.42 tons yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10
providers.  
 “We continue to expect gold to tread water, if not slip,
during the summer weeks,” Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
analysts including  Nick Moore  said in a report today. “The
steady performance in the first weeks of July suggests that
price dips are likely to stimulate buying interest. Should we
see a more significant selloff we expect decent support at
$1,150 an ounce.”  
 Silver for September delivery in New York fell 0.5 percent
to $18.265 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery declined 0.5
percent to $1,526.30 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
dropped 1.3 percent to $461.25 an ounce.  
 Platinum demand should improve in the fourth quarter and
the metal is “good value” below $1,500, RBS said in the
report. Demand through platinum exchange-traded products was
less than 3 tons in the second quarter, down from 8.5 tons in
the first quarter, the bank said.
