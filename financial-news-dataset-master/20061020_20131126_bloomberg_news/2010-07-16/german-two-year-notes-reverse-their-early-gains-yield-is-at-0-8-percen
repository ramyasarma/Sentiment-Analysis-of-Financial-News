             German government bonds jumped after
a U.S. gauge of consumer confidence trailed forecasts, fueling
concern the global economic recovery is sputtering and boosting
demand for the safest assets.  
 Two-year notes reversed losses that had pushed the yield to
the highest in more than two months, and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index fell 1.7 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment slid to 66.5 in
July from 76 in June, below the median forecast of 74 in a
Bloomberg survey of 62 economists. Spanish bonds surged for a
second day, propelling the two-year yield to the lowest since
May 28, after the nation raised the maximum target in an
offering of 15-year securities yesterday.  
 “The market is focusing more on the double-dip scenario”
in the U.S., said  Elwin de Groot , a senior market economist at
Rabobank Groep in Utrecht, Netherlands. “From a longer-term
perspective, we can argue that bund yields are extremely low,
but the momentum for risk assets is just not strong enough and
there’s a lot of uncertainty.”  
 The 10-year German bund yield decreased three basis points
to 2.62 percent at 4 p.m. in London, leaving it two basis points
lower in the week. The 3 percent security maturing July 2020
gained 0.23, or 2.3 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,294) face amount,
to 103.28. The two-year note yield fell two basis points to 0.78
percent, after climbing to the most since May 3.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 1.6 percent after
the confidence report.  
 Peripheral Auctions  
 Bunds declined earlier after successful bond sales this
week in peripheral countries from Greece to Spain gave investors
the confidence to seek higher-yielding alternatives, after a
rally that pushed the 10-year bund yield to a record low 2.5
percent in June.  
 Spain’s 10-year bond yield tumbled 13 basis points to 4.51
percent after falling 11 basis points yesterday. That has pushed
the extra yield, or spread,  investors  demand to hold the
country’s 10-year securities instead of bunds down to 186 basis
points, from 206 basis points a week ago.  
 Portugal sold more debt than it had previously indicated at
an auction on July 14.  
 “There’s some change in risk sentiment and haven flows,
and hence we’ve seen a strong underperformance by the German
bond market,” said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-income
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “The market is
becoming a bit more comfortable about how this overall risk
within the sovereign space will play out.”  
 German debt has returned 6.5 percent so far this year,
compared with 6 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 6.1 percent for
U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts’ Societies. Spanish
bonds lost 1.5 percent, the indexes show. Greek securities have
lost investors 18 percent.
