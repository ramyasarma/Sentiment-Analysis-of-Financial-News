             Aurubis AG , Europe’s biggest copper
refiner, closed a smelter in Hamburg last night because of a
fire, losing about a day’s worth of production.  
 Repairs probably will take until noon local time on July
19, the Hamburg-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Other melting facilities in the primary smelter,
where the fire occurred, will run at reduced capacity until
then, it said. Property damage will be no more than 150,000
euros ($194,800), Aurubis estimated.  
 The fire broke out at about 5:30 p.m. after molten copper
leaking from a furnace ignited cabling, according to the
statement. As many as 120 firefighters were in action, most of
whom were able to leave the plant by 9 p.m.  
 The shutdown cost about 1,300 metric tons of output, the
statement shows. The smelter can process about 3,000 tons a day
of raw materials, or copper concentrate, according to Aurubis
spokeswoman  Michaela Hessling .
