             Dimension Data Plc ’s Executive
Chairman  Jeremy Ord , who helped found the company 27 years ago,
will make up to 14.1 million pounds ($21.8 million) by selling
stock in Africa’s largest computer-services company to Japan’s
 Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.   
 Ord, 53, holds 11.75 million shares in the London-listed
company, excluding his share incentive awards, according to
Bloomberg  data . NTT yesterday offered to buy all of Didata’s
stock at 120 pence apiece, 18 percent more than the
Johannesburg-based company’s closing price on June 14, the
companies said in a statement.  
 The chairman, who started Didata with high school friends
using a loan from  FirstRand Ltd. , was Didata’s chief executive
officer in 2000 when he took the company to list in London. The
stock was included in the  FTSE 100 Index , reaching a record 693
pence in August 2000. Over the next two years, amid the fallout
from dot-com crisis, its stock plummeted to a low of 13.75
pence, never reaching its previous levels.  
 The acquisition of Didata, which offers information-
technology services from outsourcing to supplying computer
equipment, gives  NTT  a company with more than 6,000 customers
across 49 markets as the Tokyo-based carrier seeks to reverse
three years of sales declines.  
 Didata owns Internet Solutions, which provides Internet,
data and telecommunications services to corporate clients across
Africa. It also controls Plessey, a builder of network equipment
in Africa, and Datacraft Asia Ltd., Singapore’s largest builder
of computer networks.  
 Ord wants to remain with the company and enjoy “this new
era for himself and Didata,” said spokeswoman  Hilary King  in a
telephone interview. According to Didata’s 2009  annual report ,
Ord holds 4.7 million share options, 600,000 share appreciation
rights and 3.4 million long-term incentive awards.  
 After  averaging  79.85 pence in the 12 months through July
14, Didata’s  share  price soared 20 percent yesterday to 121.8
pence after the NTT transaction was announced, giving the
company a market value of 2.08 billion pounds.
