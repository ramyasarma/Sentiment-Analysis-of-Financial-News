             The bursting of the U.S. housing
bubble has left homeowners buried under about $4 trillion of
excess mortgage debt, according to  Dhaval Joshi , the chief
strategist at RAB Capital.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY compares the total amount of home
loans outstanding with the value of residential real estate, as
compiled by the Federal Reserve, for the past two decades. The
latter is adjusted to reflect the average 40 percent debt-to-
value ratio that prevailed from 1990 to 2005.  
 Mortgage balances were $3.64 trillion higher than the
adjusted figure as of March 31, as shown in the top panel. The
actual ratio, which stood at 62 percent at the end of the first
quarter, appears in the bottom panel.  
 To eliminate the excess and bring down the ratio to its
historical norm, either  house prices  would have to surge or
home-loan repayments and  defaults  would have to accelerate,
Joshi said today in an interview.  
 “In either scenario, it would be a disaster,” the
strategist said, adding that prices are unlikely to recover any
time soon. The U.S. has 4 million more homes than it needs, by
his count. Interest rates will have to stay relatively low for
“a prolonged period” to revive the housing market, he said.  
 Joshi raised what he called the “4 trillion dollar
question” in a July 9 report.  Barry Ritholtz , the author of
“Bailout Nation,” reproduced most of the report in a  posting 
yesterday on his blog, the Big Picture.
