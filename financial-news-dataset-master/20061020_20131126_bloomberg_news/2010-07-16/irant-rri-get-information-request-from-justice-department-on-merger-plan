             Mirant Corp.  and RRI Energy Inc.,
the U.S. power producers that agreed in April to merge, said the
Justice Department asked for additional information regarding
their proposed transaction.  
 The companies are preparing to respond to the action, which
is known as a second request, Atlanta-based Mirant and Houston-
based  RRI  said today in a statement. The deal is scheduled to
close before the end of this year, according to the companies.  
 Mirant and RRI said in April that they would combine in an
all-stock transaction valued at the time at about $1.6 billion.
The new entity, GenOn Energy, will have about 24,700 megawatts
of generating capacity with plants across the country.  
 RRI , formerly known as Reliant Energy, previously sold its
Texas power-retailing business to  NRG Energy Inc.   
 Mirant  fell 36 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $10.72 as of the 4
p.m. close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  RRI 
dropped 12 cents, or 3 percent, to $3.87.
