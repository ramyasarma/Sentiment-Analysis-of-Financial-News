             Israel’s Cabinet endorsed the
Finance Ministry’s budget proposal for 2011 and 2012, which
allocates more money for education and curbs defense spending.  
 “After years of increasing the defense budget
significantly and contributing to the strengthening of Israel’s
security establishment, the government has chosen to grant some
of the additional money to education,” Finance Minister  Yuval Steinitz  said in a statement after today’s Cabinet vote.  
 Israel  bounced back  from the global economic crisis faster
than many other developed countries. The Finance Ministry
expects growth of 3.8 percent in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012. The
two-year budget proposal calls for spending to increase by 2.7
percent each year in real terms, with deficits forecast at 3
percent of economic output in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012.  
 Twenty ministers voted for the spending plan, five were
against and four abstained, according to the statement. The
budget must now be approved by the parliament.
