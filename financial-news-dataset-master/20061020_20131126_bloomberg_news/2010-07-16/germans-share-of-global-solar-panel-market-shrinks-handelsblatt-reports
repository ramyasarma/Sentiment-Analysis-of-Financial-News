             The global market share for German
solar-panel makers including Q-Cells SE and SolarWorld AG shrank
between 2006 and 2009, Handelsblatt reported, citing a study by
management consultant PRTM.  
 German companies’ share of panel sales declined to 31
percent in 2009 from 53 percent in 2006, according to the
survey, the newspaper said.  
 Chinese companies such as Trina Solar Ltd. now have the
largest market share, the newspaper added.
