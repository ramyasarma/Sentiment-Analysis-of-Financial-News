             Bank of Ireland Plc  plans to
eliminate about 750 jobs over the next two years in its biggest
cost-cutting initiative since its government rescue last year,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans.  
 The largest Irish lender by market value will reduce its
workforce by about 5 percent through voluntary redundancies,
said the people said, who declined to be identified before
employees are told. The Dublin-based bank may announce the cuts
as soon as today, the people said.  
 Ireland’s government injected 3.5 billion euros ($4.5
billion) into the bank last year as bad debts surged after the
country’s decade-long property boom collapsed. The European
Commission yesterday approved the lender’s restructuring plan,
which includes a plan to dispose of New Ireland Assurance, its
life and pensions division, Bank of Ireland Asset Management and
ICS Building Society.  
 The bank will continue existing pay freezes until a review
in April, the people said. A further review is scheduled for
December 2011, they added.  
 Bank of Ireland had a total of 14,636 employees at the end
of December, according to its annual report. About 2,200 people
have left the lender since March 2008, mostly as a result of the
lender not replacing employees as they left the group.
