             The dollar dropped to its weakest
level in 2010 against the yen as signs the U.S. economy is
losing momentum supported speculation that the Federal Reserve
will keep borrowing costs low for the rest of the year.  
 The greenback touched a level weaker than $1.30 versus the
euro for the first time since May as a gauge of U.S. consumer
confidence dropped more than economists expected and corporate
revenue missed analyst forecasts. The yen rallied against all of
its major counterparts as a decline in U.S. stocks discouraged
demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 “We’ve switched from watching Europe to watching the
U.S.,” said  Camilla Sutton , a Bank of Nova Scotia currency
strategist in Toronto. “Interest rates are playing a very large
role in markets right now.”  
 The yen appreciated 0.9 percent to 86.62 per dollar at 4:35
p.m. in New York, from 87.40 yesterday, after reaching 86.27,
the strongest level since Dec. 1. The yen gained 1.1 percent to
111.97 per euro, from 113.17. The dollar traded at $1.2925
versus the euro, compared with $1.2950, after touching $1.3008,
the weakest level since May 10.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain dropped to 27,050 on July 13, compared with
record net shorts of 113,890 in May, figures from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed today.  
 Norway’s krone dropped 2.1 percent to 13.88 yen and
Brazil’s real slid 1.5 percent to 48.60 yen on speculation
investors reduced trades in which they borrow where interest
rates are low to buy higher-yielding assets elsewhere. Japan’s
target lending rate of 0.1 percent makes the yen popular for
funding such transactions.  
 Drop in Stocks  
 Stocks dropped on the slump in consumer sentiment and
lower-than-estimated revenue at Bank of America Corp. and
General Electric Co. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 2.8
percent, erasing its gain for the week. Crude oil for August
delivery decreased 1 percent to $75.56 a barrel.  
 “There’s still a lot of nervousness in the market, and it
seems the yen can do no wrong,” said  Michael Derks , chief
strategist in London at FXPro Financial Services Ltd., a
foreign-exchange trader.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment dropped this month to 66.5, the
lowest level since August 2009. The median forecast of 62
economists in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a drop to 74. U.S.
consumer prices slid 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent
decrease in the previous month, the Labor Department reported.  
 Weekly Loss  
 The dollar lost 2.2 percent against the euro this week in
its biggest five-day drop in almost a month and fell 2.2 percent
versus the yen. The euro appreciated 0.2 percent against Japan’s
currency.  
 Traders have cut bets to 14 percent that the U.S. central
bank will increase its  benchmark rate  by its December meeting,
down from 27 percent odds a month earlier, according to CME
Group Inc. futures.  
 “The poor economic data has helped weaken expectations for
any increases in U.S. interest rates,” said  Yuichiro Harada ,
senior vice president of the foreign-exchange division in Tokyo
at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest publicly
traded bank in terms of assets.  
 The euro erased its gain versus the dollar as a gauge of
momentum indicated the shared currency’s recent advance may be
difficult to sustain.  
 The seven-day relative strength index of the euro versus
the greenback touched 78.9, almost the highest level since
September. Readings above 70 indicate an asset’s value may have
risen too fast and be poised for a reversal.  
 Euro’s Rally  
 The euro has rallied 8.9 percent versus the dollar since
reaching a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7 as concern eased
that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis would undermine the region’s
economic recovery.  
 Spain, which has the third-largest deficit in the euro
region, sold 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-year bonds
yesterday. It attracted bids worth 2.57 times the securities
offered, compared with 1.79 in an April sale.  
 The yen rose against the dollar as the extra yield
investors demand to hold Treasuries over Japanese debt shrank.
The difference between two-year yields was 0.45 percentage
point, compared with this year’s low of 0.44 percentage point,
set on June 29. The two-year U.S.  yield  fell today to the all-
time low of 0.5765 percent.  
 “A narrowing in yield spreads between Japan and the U.S.
notes also creates the basis for yen appreciation,” said
 Masaaki Kanno , chief economist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and a former official at the Bank of Japan.
