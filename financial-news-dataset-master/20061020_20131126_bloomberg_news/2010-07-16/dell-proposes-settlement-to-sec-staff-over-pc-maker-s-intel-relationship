             Dell Inc. , the computer maker under
investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
proposed a settlement related to allegations about its
relationship with  Intel Corp.   
 The SEC’s staff will recommend the commission approve the
proposal, Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said today in a
statement. The proposal’s terms are the same Dell disclosed in
June, when it said it was in discussions with the SEC. Under
those, Dell would be subject to a fine, and  Michael Dell  would
be allowed to continue as chief executive officer.  
 Dell, under investigation since 2005, is being probed for
accounting and financial reporting issues related to its
partnership with the chipmaker. The company has said it may face
penalties related to alleged violations of fraud laws and
failure to disclose the extent of the relationship. Dell has set
aside $100 million for the settlement.  
 “It’s a step in the right direction,” said  Aaron Rakers ,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis. He advises
investors to buy Dell shares and doesn’t own any. The
investigation had created a “degree of uncertainty” because a
failure to reach a settlement could have resulted in, for
example, the CEO stepping down, he said.  
 SEC spokesman  John Nester  declined to comment. Any
settlement would be subject to approval by the SEC and a U.S.
District Court, Dell said.  
 Dell, the world’s third-biggest PC maker,  fell  58 cents to
$13.07 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 4:01 p.m. New York
time. The stock has declined 9 percent this year.  
 SEC Overhang  
 Dell delayed part of its annual shareholder meeting today
until August 12 while it distributes information to shareholders
about the settlement.  
 “Any time you have an SEC overhang, it’s always good to
put it behind you,” said  Abhey Lamba , an  analyst  at ISI Group
in New York. Still, “it’s something from their past, and it’s
not something that is on the top of investors’ minds.”  
 The SEC began the investigation in 2005 that moved Dell to
restate results, fire workers and change its corporate
governance policies.  Intel , based in Santa Clara, California,
has come under scrutiny by regulators who have alleged the
chipmaker used payments to PC makers to dissuade customers from
purchasing products from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
