             The euro’s rise against the dollar
indicates that investors are becoming more concerned about the
U.S. economy and corporate earnings than they are about European
sovereign debt, Deutsche Bank AG said in a note today.  
 “The recent steady euro rally is indicative of a market
where the attention is subtly moving away from European funding
issues and onto U.S. data,” wrote analysts including  Jim Reid 
in London. “Indeed, Spain has now completed its July issuance
program, so the negative EU Sovereign newsflow should die down
for a while. Data and earnings will thus dictate sentiment.”  
 The euro rose 0.17 percent to $1.2972 as of 10:45 a.m. in
London, the highest level since May 4.
