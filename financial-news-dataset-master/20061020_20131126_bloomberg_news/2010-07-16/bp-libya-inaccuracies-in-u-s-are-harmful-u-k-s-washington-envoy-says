             British Ambassador to the U.S.  Nigel Sheinwald  rejected suggestions that the release last year of
Lockerbie bomber  Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi  and BP Plc’s commercial
interests were linked.  
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  said yesterday  it
will hold a hearing on July 29 into the circumstances of Al-
Megrahi’s release to Libya. Senator  Robert Menendez , a New
Jersey Democrat, said the panel will ask officials from London-
based BP, Europe’s second-biggest energy company by market
value, to testify.  
 Sheinwald wrote yesterday to complain before Prime Minister
 David Cameron ’s scheduled meeting in Washington with President
 Barack Obama  next week. The row over Libya follows Obama’s
criticism of BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil leak.  
 “I am troubled by the claims made in the press that
Megrahi was released because of an oil deal involving BP, and
that the medical evidence supporting his release was paid for by
the Libyan government.” Sheinwald wrote in a letter to Senator
 John F. Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee. He said these were “inaccuracies”
that were “harmful to the U.K.”  
 A group of U.S. senators this week questioned whether the
bomber was freed as part of a deal to allow BP to drill for oil
in Libya, and called on the London-based company to suspend
drilling operations there.  
 Shares Rebound  
 Shares of BP have dropped 30 percent this year as the
company fought the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. The stock
today  jumped as much as 6.2 percent  in London trading after the
company said it stopped the flow of oil from the Gulf of Mexico
well for the first time since the spill in April.  
 Al-Megrahi was freed by Scotland, which has an independent
justice system, on compassionate grounds in August because he
was dying of cancer. He remains alive. The Libyan was jailed in
2001 for the 1988 killing of 270 people in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.  
 At the time, Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  said he couldn’t
intervene in Scotland’s decision. Afterwards, he said he had
been “repulsed” by the hero’s welcome Al-Megrahi was given on
his return to Libya. Cameron, who replaced Brown as prime
minister in May, opposed the release at the time, a point
Sheinwald made in his letter to Kerry.
