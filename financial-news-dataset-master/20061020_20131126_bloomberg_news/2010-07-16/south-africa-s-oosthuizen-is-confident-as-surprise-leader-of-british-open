             Louis Oosthuizen doesn’t care if
golf fans ask “Who’s that?” when they see his name at the top
of the leaderboard at the British Open.  
 Oosthuizen, a South African who plays on the PGA European
Tour, shot a 5-under-par 67 in today’s second round at St.
Andrews to take a 3-shot lead. It’s an unlikely place for a guy
who’s made just one cut in his seven prior major championship
appearances.  
 “I’m OK with everyone waking up and seeing my name on
top,” Oosthuizen, 54th in the Official World Golf Ranking, said
in a news conference. “It’s probably the position anyone wants
to be in, playing a major on the weekend. I think it’s what we
work to achieve, and I’m just very happy with the two rounds I
put together.”  
 Oosthuizen, 27, made three straight early birdies in the
rain this morning to reach 10-under and move past overnight
leader  Rory McIlroy  of Northern Ireland. He then alternated
birdies and bogeys from the 10th through 14th holes before a
birdie at the 18th got him to 12-under.  
 After shooting 65 yesterday, Oosthuizen has made the
British Open cut to play the final two rounds for the first time
in four tries. He said picking up his first European Tour win in
the year helped his self-confidence.  
 “I’m hitting it well and I’m just having a lot of fun,
really,” he said.  
 Oosthuizen’s given name is Lodewicus Theodorus, after his
grandfather, but almost everyone calls him Louis. Except for his
friends, who’ve nicknamed him “Shrek.”  
 Friendly Jab  
 “It’s the gap in the teeth,” he laughed. “My friends say
I look like Shrek, some of my friends, and you can’t choose your
friends, so what can I say?”  
 Oosthuizen gives much of the credit for his career to
another South African golfer,  Ernie Els . The son of a farmer, he
joined the three-time major winner’s foundation as a junior
golfer at the age of 17.  
 “It was unbelievable what he did for me traveling around
the country, helping with expenses, things like that,”
Oosthuizen said. “He such a good mentor, and probably without
him, those three years I’ve been in his foundation, I wouldn’t
have been here.”  
 Now that he’s here, Oosthuizen plans to stay, at least
through the weekend.  
 “I’ve booked a house until Sunday night, so yeah, I was
planning on making the cut,” he said.
