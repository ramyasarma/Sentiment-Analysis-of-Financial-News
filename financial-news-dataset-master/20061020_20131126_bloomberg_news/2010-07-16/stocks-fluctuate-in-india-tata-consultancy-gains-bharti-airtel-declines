             India’s stocks rose, with the
benchmark index advancing for a second straight week, led by
software exporters after  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. 
quarterly net income beat estimates.  
 Tata Consultancy, the nation’s biggest software-services
provider, gained the most in a year. Its first-quarter profit
rose 20 percent to 18.4 billion rupees ($394 million), exceeding
the 17.6 billion rupee average of 25 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Grasim Industries Ltd. , a cement maker owned by
the Aditya Birla Group, climbed for the first time in four days
after it was upgraded by Morgan Stanley.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
added 46.36, or 0.3 percent, to 17,955.82 after swinging between
gains and losses at least 12 times. The gauge climbed 0.7
percent for the week, its second week of gains. The S&P CNX
 Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange increased 0.3 percent
to 5,393.90. The  BSE 200 Index  rose 0.4 percent to 2,287.54.  
 “The positive numbers from Tata Consultancy gave some
confidence to the markets,” said Mumbai-based  Sadanand Shetty ,
a fund manager at Taurus Asset Management Co., which manages
$640 million in assets. “Overall, though, it seems earnings
upgrades are not happening for Sensex companies.”  
 More Business  
 Tata Consultancy surged 6.6 percent to 833.65 rupees, its
biggest climb since July 30. Profit rose for a fifth consecutive
quarter as overseas companies outsourced more business to
India’s largest software-services provider.  Infosys Technologies
Ltd. , the second-largest, added 0.6 percent to 2,777 rupees.  
 Tata Consultancy is the first Sensex company to announce
results for the June quarter that beat estimates. Infosys and
 Housing Development Finance Corp.  reported earnings this week
that lagged behind analysts’ estimates.  
 Grasim rose 1.3 percent to 1,834.1 rupees. The stock was
raised to “overweight” from “equal-weight” by  Ashish Jain ,
an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who said the stock trades at a
“deep discount” to its fair value and that a likely
“weakness” in the shares over the next two months will be an
opportunity for investors to add to holdings.  
 Tata Motors Ltd. , India’s biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, extended gains for the second day after
saying global sales rose 46 percent in June. The stock advanced
2.8 percent to 832.4 rupees, after rising 1.2 percent yesterday.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  6.47 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 14, increasing total investments in the stocks
this year to 388 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Hindustan Motors Ltd.  (HM IN) advanced 8.6 percent to 25.95
rupees. India’s oldest carmaker rose after Nikkei English News
reported Mitsubishi Motors Corp. may buy its South India plant.
Mitsubishi has no plans to buy the factory, spokesman  Kai Inada 
said today by phone.  
 Sesa Goa Ltd.  (SESA IN) climbed 1.1 percent to 343.25
rupees. India’s biggest iron ore exporter plans to invest $500
million to expand its mining and supply infrastructure, the
Hindu Business Line reported, quoting  Prasun Kumar Mukherjee ,
managing director. Mukherjee couldn’t immediately be reached at
his office telephone for comment on the report.  
 Technofab Engineering Ltd.  (TECE IN) surged 24 percent to
296.95 rupees in its trading debut. The engineering and
construction company raised 718 million rupees selling 2.99
million shares to the public at 240 rupees a piece.  
 Tilaknagar Industries Ltd.  (TLNGR IN) jumped 7.2 percent to
168.2 rupees. The liquor manufacturer rose after its shares
started trading on the National Stock Exchange, India’s largest
bourse, in addition to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The move will
increase the volume of shares traded and prompt “more funds to
play in”, said Sameer Vedak, an analyst at Finquest Securities
Pvt., who rates the stock as “buy.”
