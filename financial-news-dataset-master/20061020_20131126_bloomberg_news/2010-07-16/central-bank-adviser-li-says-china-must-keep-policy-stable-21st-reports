             China central bank adviser Li Daokui
said the government must keep its macroeconomic policies stable
in the second half of this year, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported today.  
 Li said he doesn’t support changes in monetary policy, the
newspaper reported. China’s trade surplus won’t continue to grow
in the second half, the report cited Li as saying. The nation
should also remain alert on inflation in the second half, Li was
cited as saying.  
 China’s economy may grow about 10.2 percent this year, the
newspaper cited Li as saying. During the next decade, China’s
economy will preserve a growth of more than 9 percent, the
report cited Li as saying. China in the long term should
maintain a tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy, Li was
cited as saying.
