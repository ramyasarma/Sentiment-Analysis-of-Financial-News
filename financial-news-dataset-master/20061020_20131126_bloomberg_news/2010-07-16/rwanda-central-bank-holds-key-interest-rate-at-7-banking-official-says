             Rwanda’s central bank today kept its
key interest rate at 7 percent, said Joseph Nzabonikuza, a
director of research and policy analysis at the bank.  
 “Liquidity is quite satisfactory” and inflation is
increasing “slightly,” he said in a telephone interview from
Kigali, the capital.  
 Rwanda’s annual inflation rate rose to about 5 percent last
month, Nzabonikuza said. It climbed to 4.21 percent in May from
2.74 percent a month earlier, according to the website of the
 National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda .  
 The coffee-producing nation’s economy will probably expand
between 7 percent and 8 percent this year, from at least 6
percent in 2009, as the global recovery boosts demand for its
exports, National Bank of Rwanda Governor  Francois Kanimba  said
on July 14.  
 Rwanda, a landlocked central African nation, is rebuilding
its economy after about 800,000 people, or more than a 10th of
its population, were killed in a 1994 genocide when ethnic Hutu
militias slaughtered minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus over a
100-day period.
