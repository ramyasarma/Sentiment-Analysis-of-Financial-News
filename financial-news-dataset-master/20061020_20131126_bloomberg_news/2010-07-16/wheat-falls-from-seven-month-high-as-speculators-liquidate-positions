             Wheat fell the most in a week on
speculation that investors are liquidating positions after
prices jumped to the highest level since November.  
 Before today, wheat surged 24 percent this month on reports
that a drought in Russia, the fourth-biggest exporter of the
grain, will curb production. Investors may have sold on concern
that rain may fall this weekend in Russia and the European
Union, which also has been parched.  
 “It doesn’t need a reason to go lower when it’s this
overbought,” said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds
Marketing and Investments in Hays, Kansas. “If you’ve been long
for two weeks or a week, you’ve made so much money, why would
you risk holding it over the weekend? Weather markets are brutal
on Monday. They’ll sleep better taking money off the table.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $5.8725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Today’s decline was the biggest since July 9. Yesterday, the
price touched $5.985 a bushel, the highest level since Nov. 23.
Futures gained 9.2 percent this week.  
 Growers in Russia harvested 13.9 million metric tons of
grain as of yesterday, 12 percent more than a year earlier, as
dry weather allowed farmers to work faster, the Agriculture
Ministry said. The winter-wheat harvest was 6.8 percent ahead of
last year’s, at 9.4 million tons, the ministry said.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
