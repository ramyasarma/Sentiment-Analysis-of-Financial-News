             Natural gas futures dropped for the
fourth time this week on concern that supplies of the power-
plant and factory fuel are ample to meet demand during a
sluggish economic recovery.  
 Gas lost as much as 2.5 percent after Baker Hughes Inc.
data showed the number of U.S. drilling rigs rose to the highest
level in almost 17 months this week. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
cut its forecast for gas prices in the second half of this year
by 17 percent, citing surging U.S. production.  
 “People are looking at this market and understand that
there are too many rigs working and production is too high,”
said  Scott Hanold , an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets in
Minneapolis. “There is concern that prices in the next couple
of years could be pretty soft.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery dropped 6.7 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $4.519 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have fallen 19
percent this year.  
 U.S. gas drilling rigs  rose 15 to 979 this week , the
highest level since Feb. 20, 2009, according to Baker Hughes
Inc. Horizontal rigs, which are mostly used in drilling for
shale gas, declined  for the first week in 10 , down four to 859.  
 Goldman cut its forecast for gas prices in the second half
to $4.63 per million Btu, analysts including  David Greely  said
in a research report. The company reduced its estimate for 2011
prices to $5.25 from $6.  
 “U.S. natural gas production continues to surge this year,
driven by the shale gas revolution,” Goldman said in the
report.  
 Production Estimates  
 Output will average 61.26 billion cubic feet a day this
year, up 2.1 percent from 59.98 billion in 2009, the Energy
Department said last week.  
 The government “projects a continuing decline in Gulf of
Mexico production, which is offset by gains in onshore
production,” the department said in its monthly Short Term
Energy Outlook.  
 Gas inventories this year will “remain very near last
year’s levels” and stockpiles will reach 3.81 trillion cubic
feet by the end of October, the department said in the outlook.
Supplies rose to a record 3.837 trillion cubic feet on Nov. 27.  
 Prices gained 6.5 percent yesterday, the most in more than
six months, after an Energy Department report showed a smaller-
than-forecast inventory increase.  
 Supply Report  
 Gas stockpiles gained 78 billion cubic feet in the week
ended July 9 to 2.84 trillion, the department said. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected an increase of 80 billion. The
five-year average increase is 89 billion.  
 “Looking forward, given where production is, I don’t see
much upside to gas prices unless we reset the dial with a lower
rig count,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst at SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey Inc. in Houston.  
 Temperatures will be above average in the U.S. East Coast
and Midwest next week, according to  the National Weather
Service .  
 New York will have a high of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) on July 21, 5 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Chicago’s temperature is forecast to hit 90.  
 New York saw 103 degrees Fahrenheit on July 6, a record for
the date, according to the National Weather Service.  
 About 22 percent of electricity is generated using natural
gas, Energy Department figures show.  
 Cooling requirements in the U.S. will be 27 percent higher
than normal from tomorrow through July 23, according to Weather
Derivatives of Belton, Missouri.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 25.1 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $4.6788 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
207,044 as of 2:47 p.m., compared with a three-month average
total of 251,000. Volume was 414,981 yesterday. Open interest
was 788,096 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
834,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
