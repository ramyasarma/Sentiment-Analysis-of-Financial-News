             The euro may reverse its recent
advances against the dollar given the “slim” likelihood of a
“very positive surprise” from European bank stress tests next
week, UniCredit SpA said in a note today.  
 “The upside potential at this stage has probably been
exhausted,”  Marco Annunziata , chief economist at UniCredit in
London, wrote in a note to investors today, calling the stress
tests a “very high stakes game.”  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine if they can survive potential losses on sovereign
bond holdings. “Hopefully the exercise will be handled
professionally enough to avoid a major accident,” Annunziata
wrote.  
 The euro surpassed $1.30 today for the first time since May
4 and traded at $1.2970 as of 2 p.m. London time.  
 The European currency is unlikely to fall past $1.20 unless
there is a “major negative surprise,” given that U.S. economic
growth is slowing and the Federal Reserve “toying with the idea
of quantitative easing,” Annunziata said.
