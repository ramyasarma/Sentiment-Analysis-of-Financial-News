             Ukraine’s Finance Ministry said the
country won’t sell bonds in overseas debt markets after meeting
with investors.  
 The government “decided not to proceed with a new
transaction at this time, given other immediate sources of
financing and its liquidity position,” the ministry said in a
press release late yesterday. “Ukraine will consider
international capital market financing on ongoing basis based on
its needs and market environment.”
