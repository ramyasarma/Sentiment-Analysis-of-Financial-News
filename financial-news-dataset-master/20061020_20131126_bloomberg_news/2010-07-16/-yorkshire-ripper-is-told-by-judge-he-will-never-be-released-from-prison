             A U.K. High Court judge ruled that
 Peter Sutcliffe , the serial killer known as the Yorkshire
Ripper, will never be released from prison.  
 Sutcliffe, 64, now known as Peter Coonan, was convicted in
1981 of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others
in attacks across northern England. Justice John Mitting ruled
at the High Court in London today that Sutcliffe will remain in
custody for the rest of his life.  
 Statements by relatives of six of Sutcliffe’s victims are
“moving accounts of the great loss and widespread and permanent
harm to the living caused by six of his crimes,” Mitting said
in his ruling. “None of them suggest any term other than a
whole life term would be regarded by them as appropriate.”  
 Currently serving 20 life terms at Broadmoor high-security
psychiatric hospital in southern England, Sutcliffe was seeking
clarity on whether he would ever be considered for parole.  
 The BBC reported today that 38 convicted killers are
currently in the same position as Sutcliffe.  
 The case is R v Peter Coonan (formerly Sutcliffe).
