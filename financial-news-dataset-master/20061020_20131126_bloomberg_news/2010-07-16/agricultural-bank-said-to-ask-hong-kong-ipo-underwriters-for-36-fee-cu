             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  is
negotiating a 36 percent cut in underwriter fees for its $10.5
billion initial stock sale in Hong Kong to reflect talks with
corporate investors that the lender handled itself, said three
people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The seven arrangers, led by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ,
Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp., may share
about $70 million of the roughly $205 million of gross fees
upfront, the people said, declining to be identified as they
aren’t authorized to discuss commissions publicly.  
 Agricultural Bank asked for a $75 million fee cut, arguing
that it mainly handled talks with corporate investors such as
Standard Chartered Plc itself, the people said. Such buyers
accounted for more than half the Hong Kong sale. The reduction
may reflect intensifying competition among underwriters in China,
which accounts for a growing share of global stock sales, said
Sanford C Bernstein & Co. analyst  Michael Werner .  
 “This is a place where you don’t want to make enemies,”
Hong Kong-based Werner said. “The business here seems a bit
more cut-throat. Some Chinese names are going to have more
bargaining power.”  
 The Beijing-based bank also withheld about $48 million of
fees to be distributed among advisers based on performance, said
the people. At least $12 million of the fee pool will go
to lawyers, financial advisers and so-called junior syndicate
banks who worked on the deal, according to the people.  
 First-Day Gain  
 Shares of Agricultural Bank began trading in Hong Kong
today,  rising  2.2 percent to HK$3.27 at the 4 p.m. close. The
stock debuted in Shanghai yesterday.  
 Chinese companies have raised $54.8 billion in IPOs this
year, accounting for more than two-fifths of the global total,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Investment banks managing the IPO stand to earn more should
Agricultural Bank exercise an option to expand the sale by up to
15 percent to cover excess demand. That would enable the lender
to raise up to $22.1 billion, making it the largest IPO ever.  
 CICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley were joint global
coordinators for the Hong Kong part of the $19.2 billion IPO and
will get the largest share of base fees, the people said.
Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Macquarie Group Ltd. and
Agricultural Bank’s investment-banking unit also helped
underwrite the offering.  
 Ding Yuan, a Beijing-based press official at Agricultural
Bank, declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the
underwriters.  
 Less Work  
 Agricultural Bank is paying 1.96 percent of gross proceeds
in Hong Kong in fees, while the rate for the Shanghai portion of
the sale is 1.16 percent, or 688.44 million yuan ($101.6
million), according to IPO documents. CICC, China Galaxy
Securities Co.,  Citic Securities Co.  and Guotai Junan Securities
Co. managed the Shanghai offering.  
 The fees are lower than in rival Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China’s $21.9 billion IPO in October 2006, which yielded
a commission of 2.5 percent for the Hong Kong part.  
 Pan Gongsheng , who oversaw ICBC’s IPO before moving to
Agricultural Bank in 2008 to help take the lender public, argued
that fees for Agricultural Bank’s sale should be lower because
investment banks spent less time preparing it, the people said.  
 The underwriters worked on Agricultural Bank’s IPO for
about three months, the people said. ICBC’s advisers spent about
eight months on the offering, according to a person who worked
on that transaction.
