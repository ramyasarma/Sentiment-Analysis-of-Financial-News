             Rubber futures climbed, led by a
rally in the nearby contract amid speculation that low
stockpiles in Japan may make physical delivery difficult at its
expiry this month.  
 Futures in Tokyo gained for the second time this week. The
nearby contract, which will expire on July 26, jumped as much as
2.8 percent, widening the price differential with the December-
delivery futures, the most-active contract.  
 Natural rubber stockpiles monitored by the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange dropped by 6.2 percent to 1,880 metric tons on June 30,
nearing a record low of 1,408 tons reached in October 2008,
according to exchange spokesman Seiki Ichimura. Supply decreased
after rain disrupted tapping in Thailand, the world’s largest
producer and exporter, said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at Tokyo-
based broker Fujitomi Co.  
 “Tight supply is spurring a short-covering rally,” Saito
said by phone today. Speculators with short, or sell, positions
in the July contract must buy them back by July 26, the expiry
date, unless they can deliver the raw material.  
 December-delivery rubber gained as much as 1.6 percent to
266.5 yen per kilogram ($3,056 a ton) before settling at 263.9
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The price lost 3.3 percent
this week, the second drop in three weeks.  
 July-delivery rubber gained as much as 2.8 percent to 357.5
yen before settling at 355 yen. Last month, the June-delivery
contract expired at 372 yen.  
 Gains in futures were limited amid concern that a slowdown
in economic growth in China, the largest consumer, may curb
demand for the commodity used in tires, Saito at Fujitomi said.  
 Economic growth  in China slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from 11.9 percent in January-March, data showed
yesterday. China’s expansion eased after the government tempered
credit expansion, investment spending and property speculation.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 0.8 percent to 21,525 yuan ($3,177) a ton at 2:53 p.m.
local time.
