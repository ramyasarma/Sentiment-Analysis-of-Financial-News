             Crude oil may fall next week after
government reports signaled that the U.S. economic recovery will
slow, reducing fuel demand, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Thirteen of 33 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through July 23. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week 53 percent of analysts forecast a rise.  
 The Federal Reserve said yesterday that U.S. factory output
fell 0.4 percent in June, the biggest decline in a year. Other
reports showed factories pulled back in the New York and
Philadelphia regions in July.  
 “There’s nothing good in today’s economic reports that you
can point to,”  Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of energy at
MF Global in New York, said yesterday. “Oil is overpriced given
where the economy is.”  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that its
general economic index fell to 5.1 in July from 19.6 the prior
month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index declined to 5.1 this month, the lowest level
since August 2009, from 8 in June.  
 Crude oil for August delivery has increased 53 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $76.62 a barrel so far this week on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 25 percent from a year ago.  
 The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 48 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  

 
     Bloomberg’s survey of oil analysts and traders, conducted
each Thursday, asks for an assessment of whether crude oil
futures are likely to rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming
week. The results were:

                   RISE      NEUTRAL    FALL
                     8         12        13
