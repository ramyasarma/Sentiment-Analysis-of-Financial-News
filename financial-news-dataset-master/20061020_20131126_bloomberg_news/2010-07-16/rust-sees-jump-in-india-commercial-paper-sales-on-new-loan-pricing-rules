             Indian companies may double sales of
commercial paper this year as new banking rules push up the cost
of short-term loans, according to Trust Investment Advisors Ltd.  
 “Offers to arrange commercial paper sales have moved to
almost 10 a day,”  Nipa Sheth , a director at Trust Investment,
said in an interview in her Mumbai offices yesterday. A year ago
“there wouldn’t be more than one offer a day.”  
 State Bank of India, the nation’s largest by assets, said
on June 29 that it won’t lend for less than 7.5 percent interest
after the Reserve Bank of India said lenders must publish
minimum rates in an effort to improve transparency.  
 Indian Oil Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. paid about 6
percent to sell commercial paper this month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Commercial paper is short-term, unsecured
debt sold by a company to meet immediate cash needs.  
 India’s former system of so-called benchmark prime lending
rates, or BPLRs, fell short of the regulator’s transparency
objectives as banks were allowed to lend below them, RBI
Executive Director Deepak Mohanty said last month. That led to a
“disconnect” between published rates and real borrowing costs,
First Global Research said in a note to clients in March.  
 The central bank’s so-called base rate rules may add about
500 billion rupees ($10.7 billion) to India’s commercial paper
market by the end of the year, Sheth said.  
 As much as 10 percent of companies’ short-term borrowing
will “transit” to commercial paper, said  Pawan Agrawal , a
director at ratings company Crisil Ltd.
