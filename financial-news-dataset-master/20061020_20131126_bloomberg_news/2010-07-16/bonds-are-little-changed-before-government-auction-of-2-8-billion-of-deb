             India’s  10-year bonds  were little
changed before the auction of 130 billion rupees ($2.8 billion)
of bonds today, which may leave investors with less money to buy
fixed-income securities.  
 Yields held at their highest level in a week on concern the
central bank will increase its   benchmark interest rates  for the
second time this month to rein in inflation. Data published this
week showed  wholesale prices  rose more than 10 percent for a
fifth straight month in June. India will sell bonds maturing in
2017, 2022 and 2027.  
 “Investors are generally cautious before auctions as it
may reduce liquidity,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager at
Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rate decision at the policy
meeting on July 27 will be crucial.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 was little
changed at 7.64 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The price was at 101.07 per
100 rupee face amount.  
 Yields have climbed eight basis points since the  Reserve
Bank of India  raised borrowing costs for a third time this year
on July 2. The  reverse-repurchase rate  is 4 percent and the
 repurchase rate  is 5.5 percent.  
 The wholesale-price index jumped 10.55 percent from a year
earlier in June, after a 10.16 percent gain in May.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps in India, derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, increased.
The fixed payment made to receive a floating rate rose eight
basis points to 5.78 percent.
