             Juniper Networks Inc. , the second-
largest maker of computer-networking equipment, was sued by
Enhanced Security Research LLC for allegedly infringing two
patents. Juniper shares fell more than 3 percent.  
 Enhanced Security, of Berkeley, California, contends
Juniper is using the inventions for detecting security breaches,
patented to Peter M. Shipley since 2000, without permission,
according to papers filed yesterday in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  
 “Juniper directly infringes” by using “intrusion
detection and prevention systems in a method described in the
patent claims,” Enhanced Security lawyers said in their
complaint, which seeks a jury trial and damages.  
 Juniper spokeswoman Jessica Kersey didn’t immediately
return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  
 Sunnyvale, California-based Juniper, with $3.31 billion in
revenue last year, fell 96 cents or 3.5 percent, to $25.90 at
4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after
earlier trading at $25.74.  
 The case is Enhanced Security Research LLC v. Juniper
Networks Inc., 10CV605, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).
