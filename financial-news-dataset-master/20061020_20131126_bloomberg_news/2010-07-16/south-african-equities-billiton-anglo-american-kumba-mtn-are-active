             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  advanced for a second day, adding 202.54, or 0.7
percent, to 27,677.22 at 10:21 a.m. in Johannesburg. The measure
is headed for its second weekly gain.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, rose for the first time in three days, climbing 3.02
rand, or 1.9 percent, to 214.98 rand, as the prices of lead, tin
and zinc rose on the London Metal Exchange.  Anglo American Plc 
(AGL SJ), the biggest investor in South African mining, rose
5.29 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 279.94 rand.  
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ), a unit of Anglo American Plc,
gained for a second day, advancing 5 rand, or 1.5 percent, to
340.50 rand. Kumba demanded that ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.
(ACL SJ) pay for ore before it’s delivered because the
steelmaker rejected two options to resolve a dispute over
supply.  ArcelorMittal South Africa , which sources two-thirds of
its ore needs from Kumba, rose 1 cent, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 75.36 rand.  
 MTN Group Ltd.  (MTN SJ), Africa’s largest mobile-phone
company, increased for a second day, rising 2.11 rand, or 1.9
percent, to 115.16 rand, after saying it will focus on investor
payouts rather than big acquisitions.
