             ABB Ltd. won its biggest power-
transmission order, worth about $700 million, to connect three
North Sea wind farms to the German grid, the company said.  
 Electricity generated by the Borkum West II wind farm and
two others in the DolWin1 cluster will be transferred onshore
over a distance of 165 kilometers (103 miles) via underwater and
underground cables,  ABB  said today in an e-mailed  statement .  
 ABB’s order from the German transmission grid operator to
supply an 800-megawatt power link is scheduled to be operational
by 2013, it said. Europe has about 100,000 megawatts of offshore
wind projects planned for the coming decades, according to the
 European Wind Energy Association . About 85 percent of Europe’s
offshore wind capacity is currently installed in the U.K., the
Netherlands and Denmark.  
 Germany gets about eight percent of its power from wind
energy and expects to double this by 2020, ABB said in its
release. On completion, about three million tons of carbon
emissions will be avoided annually, it said.  
 ABB will be responsible for system engineering, including
design, supply and installation of the offshore platform, the
offshore and onshore converter stations, and will also supply
and install the sea and land cable systems, the Zurich-based
power and automation technology group said.
