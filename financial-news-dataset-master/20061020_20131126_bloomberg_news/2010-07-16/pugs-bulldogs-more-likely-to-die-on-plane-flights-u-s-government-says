             Bulldogs, pugs and other short-faced
breeds are more likely than other dogs to die on airplanes,
according to U.S. Transportation Department data.  
 In the past five years, 122 dogs have died on flights in
the U.S., with about half of them short-faced breeds, which also
include the American Staffordshire terrier, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement without offering an explanation.  
 “People, if they’re concerned, should check with their
veterinarian before flying,” said  Bill Mosley , a Transportation
Department spokesman. Most of the dogs that died were being
transported in cargo holds rather than in passenger
compartments, he said today in a telephone interview.  
 About 2 million pets are transported each year in the U.S.
by plane, according to the agency, which collects monthly
reports of deaths, injuries and losses of pets in air transport.
In the past five years, 22 pets other than dogs died in air
transport, according to the data.
