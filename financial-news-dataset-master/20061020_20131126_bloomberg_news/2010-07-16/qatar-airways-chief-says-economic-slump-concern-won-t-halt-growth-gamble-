             Qatar Airways, the Middle Eastern
carrier with $35 billion of planes on order, will stick with its
expansion plans even amid mounting evidence that global growth
is set to slow, Chief Executive Officer  Akbar al-Baker  said.  
 “At a time of gloom, global recession and financial
crisis, we are adding 15 destinations, we take gambles,” al-
Baker said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Dubai.  
 Qatar Airways, which has orders and options for 178  Airbus
SAS  and  Boeing Co.  planes, will add flights from its base in
Doha to European cities including Brussels, Budapest and Nice on
the French Riviera and Asian locations including Phuket in
Thailand and Hanoi, Vietnam, in the coming 12 months, he said.  
 Under al-Baker, Qatar Airways is employing a model similar
to that at Dubai-based Emirates as it offers connecting services
for long-haul passengers via its Doha hub. Founded in 1994, the
carrier serves  90 destinations , up from 56 at the start of 2005.  
 Airline traffic rose 12 percent in May, led by a 19 percent
jump in premium travel, the biggest in six years, according to
the International Air Transport Association. Still, the U.S.
Federal Reserve last month trimmed its 2010 growth forecast for
the world’s largest economy, according to minutes published July
14, and U.S. retail sales fell for a second month in June.  
 Narrow-Body Decision  
 Qatar Airways is weighing whether to buy Bombardier Inc.
CSeries single-aisle jetliners or wait for Airbus to develop a
version of its A320 family with upgraded engines, said al-Baker,
who has been CEO since 1996.  
 Al-Baker, who’ll be attending the Farnborough International
Airshow next week, said he’s certain Toulouse, France-based
Airbus will announce a program to re-engineer the A320 series.  
 “They are still in the race, and we are still interested
in them,” the CEO said. “But we will also look at other
airliners because we need to create competition to get the best
conditions and the best deal from the aircraft manufacturer.”  
 The order book at Qatar Airways includes contracts for five
Airbus A380 superjumbo aircraft for delivery starting in 2012.
The company plans to introduce the 555-seat jetliners on flights
to London and other high-density routes.
