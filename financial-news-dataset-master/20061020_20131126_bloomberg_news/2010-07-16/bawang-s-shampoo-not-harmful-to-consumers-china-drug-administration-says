             BaWang International Group Holding
Ltd.’s  herbal shampoo products don’t threaten consumers’ health,
China’s State Food and Drug Administration said in a statement
on its  website  today.  
 The content level of 1, 4-dioxane in the sample products
tested by the administration won’t harm consumers, it said.  
 BaWang, China’s largest herbal shampoo maker, fell today
in Hong Kong trading, extending its decline to 23 percent since
July 14, when a magazine reported that two of the company’s
products contain a substance that may cause cancer.  
 The July 14 Next Magazine reported samples of BaWang’s
anti hair-loss formula shampoo had 10 parts per million of 1,4-
dioxane, a substance that may cause cancer.  
 The magazine report was “inaccurate and unfounded” and
the company may take legal action against the weekly, the
Guangzhou, southern China-based company said in a July 14
statement.  
 BaWang’s products comply with Chinese, Hong Kong, European
Union and U.S. FDA standards, it said, and the amounts of the
substance are too small to affect human health.
