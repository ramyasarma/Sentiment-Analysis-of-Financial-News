             Equity Bank Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest
lender by customers, headed for the highest close in one and  a
half weeks on speculation its earnings in the first half through
June will be higher.  
 The shares climbed as much as 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to
23.75 shillings and were trading at 23.50 shillings as of 9:45
a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level would be the strongest
since July 6.  
 “Investors taking ‘buy’ positions anticipate better
results compared to quarter one and the payment of an interim
dividend,” Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd. said
today in an e-mailed note to clients.  
 Equity Bank will announce its half year earnings July 20,
it said in an e-mailed statement today.
