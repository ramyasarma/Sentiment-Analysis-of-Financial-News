             Pakistan reached 216-4 at lunch on
the fourth day of the first cricket test against Australia. It
needs a further 224 to win.  
 Resuming on 114-1 in its second innings at Lord’s in
London, Pakistan is chasing a world-record victory target of
440. Umar Akmal was dismissed for 22 on the last ball before
lunch, leaving Umar Amin on 31 not out.  
 Earlier,  Salman Butt  looked set for a century, but was
stumped for 92 by wicketkeeper Tim Paine off the bowing  Marcus North . Butt shared a 102-run partnership for the third wicket
with Azhar Ali, who was caught off  Ben Hilfenhaus , for 42.  
 Australia set Pakistan 440 to win after being bowled out
for 334 yesterday.  Simon Katich  was top scorer with 83.  
 It’s the first neutral test at the ”home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a home event for Pakistan.
