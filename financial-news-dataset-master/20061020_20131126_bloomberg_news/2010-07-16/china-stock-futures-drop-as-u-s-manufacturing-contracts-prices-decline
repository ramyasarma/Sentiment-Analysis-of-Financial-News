             Most China stocks rose, led by
consumer-related companies, as investors sought resilient
earnings prospects after economic growth slowed.  
 Wuliangye Yibin Co.  and Bright Dairy & Food Co. gained more
than 3 percent among food and beverage companies.  Zijin Mining
Group Co.  dropped 5.4 percent after it said three managers were
detained by the police following an acid spill.  Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd.  lost 0.4 percent in Shanghai as it debuted in
Hong Kong.  
 About two stocks rose for each that declined on the
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index , which lost 0.03 point to
2,424.27 at the close, paring an earlier 1.5 percent loss. The
measure, which slumped the most in two weeks yesterday after
economic growth trailed estimates, is down 1.9 percent this week.
The  CSI 300 Index  gained 0.3 percent to 2,616.13.  
 “With shares now very good value, monetary conditions
likely to remain favorable and China likely to start easing some
time in the next few months, shares are likely to put in a
reasonable rally,” said  Shane Oliver , head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.  
 The Shanghai index has declined 26 percent this year, the
worst performance among benchmark Asian gauges, on concern
measures by the government to control real-estate speculation
and rising consumer prices will slow the world’s third-largest
economy. Stocks on the gauge trade at 18 times reported earnings,
compared with last year’s high of 35 times.  
 Wuliangye Yibin, a liquor maker, advanced 3.2 percent to
25.80 yuan. Bright Dairy, a milk producer, added 3.5 percent to
7.48 yuan.  Kweichow Moutai Co.  advanced 1.5 percent to 133.81
yuan.  
 Profit Gain  
 Metro Land Corp. jumped 7.1 percent to 6.46 yuan after the
department-store operator said first-half profit probably rose
at least sixfold to as much as 125 million yuan ($18 million).  
 Zijin  dropped 5.4 percent to 5.22 yuan. The police took
away the plant’s manager, deputy manager and the head of
environment, company secretary  Zheng Yuqiang  said by phone today.
The Fujian-based company is cooperating with the investigation,
he said.  
 Agricultural Bank fell 0.4 percent to 2.69 yuan. Its stock
rose 2.5 percent in Hong Kong.  
 Sichuan Western Resources Holding Co. , a copper producer,
surged 7.2 percent to 23.19 yuan, the most since May 27, after
authorities approved its application to purchase mining rights
in China’s Jiangxi province.
