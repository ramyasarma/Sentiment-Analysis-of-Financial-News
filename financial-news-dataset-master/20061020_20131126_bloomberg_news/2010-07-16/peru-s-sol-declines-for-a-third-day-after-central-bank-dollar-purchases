             Peru’s sol fell for a third day, the
longest losing streak in six weeks, after the central bank
sought to slow the currency’s rise with a record dollar
purchase.  
 The sol declined 0.1 percent to 2.8245 per U.S. dollar at
1:01 p.m. New York time, from 2.8225 yesterday.  
 The central bank bought $645 million this week, including a
record $494 million on July 14 after the sol rose to a 23-month
high. Rising demand for the local currency prompted the bank to
allow the country’s private pension funds to invest more of
their assets overseas.  
 “When the central bank makes big purchases like that, it’s
a signal to the market that the bank’s not going to allow sharp
movements in the currency,” said  Roberto Flores , an economist
at Lima-based Inteligo SAB. “The bank wants to prevent flows of
speculative capital, like the ones that entered the market in
2008.”
