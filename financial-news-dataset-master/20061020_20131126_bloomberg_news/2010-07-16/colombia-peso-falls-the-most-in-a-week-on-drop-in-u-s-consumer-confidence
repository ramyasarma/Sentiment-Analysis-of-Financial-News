             Colombia’s peso posted its first
weekly drop since May after a report showed confidence among
U.S. consumers slumped in July, signaling the biggest part of
the world’s largest economy is losing momentum.  
 The peso declined 0.2 percent this week to 1,877.85 per
U.S. dollar at 2:56 p.m. New York time, from 1,873.55 on July 9.
That’s its first weekly fall since the period ended May 21. The
peso weakened 0.4 percent today.  
 “Investors are concerned U.S. growth will slow,” said
 Felipe Campos , head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Alianza
Valores. The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest trading partner.  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of  consumer sentiment  decreased to 66.5, the lowest since
August 2009, from 76 in June. The reading was lower than the
most pessimistic forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey, with a median projection of 74.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, today to
7.48 percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.502 centavo to 124.195 centavos per peso.
