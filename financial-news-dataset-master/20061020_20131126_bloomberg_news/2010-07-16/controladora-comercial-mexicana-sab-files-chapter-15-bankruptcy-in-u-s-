             Controladora Comercial Mexicana SAB,
 Mexico ’s third-largest operator of food retailers, filed for
Chapter 15 bankruptcy to aid its main restructuring in Mexico,
already approved by creditors.  
 CCM listed both debt and assets of more than $1 billion in
documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan . The
U.S. filing seeks to protect the company from U.S. lawsuits and
creditor claims, following a July 14 announcement that it filed
to restructure in Mexico.  
 Fernando del Castillo Elorza, Mexican counsel for the
company, said in court papers that the company defaulted on debt
in 2008 after derivative transactions meant to protect it
against fluctuations in the Mexican peso went awry.  
 “In late September and early October 2008, following
turmoil in the financial markets and the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy filing, there was a significant devaluation of the
 Mexican peso  and the euro against the  U.S. dollar ,” del
Castillo Elorza said. “As a result of this devaluation, CCM
found itself facing substantial claims for margin calls,” he
added.  
 Counterparties to the derivative transactions sued the
company in  New York  State Supreme Court in a case pending before
Justice Eileen Bransten. They claimed CCM failed to post
required collateral, and sought damages of more than $1.5
billion. In May 2010, CCM reached an agreement with the parties
to restructure its debt, del Castillo Elorza said.  
 Plan Support  
 The company said that parties holding more than 85 percent
of its debt now support its plan to reorganize. The Chapter 15
filing was made to stop creditors such as some noteholders from
taking actions to derail CCM’s efforts to restructure, del
Castillo Elorza said.  
 CCM’s debt includes three types of unsecured notes: $200
million in notes due 2015, 3 billion pesos ($232.4 million) in
notes due 2027, and 111.3 million pesos in notes due 2010. It
also has Mexican commercial paper worth 1.5 billion pesos, peso-
denominated bank debt of 2.545 billion pesos, and U.S. dollar-
denominated bank debt of $99.4 million, according to court
papers.  
 Under the pre-approved plan, derivative counterparties and
commercial bank creditors will exchange their current claims for
a share of a new debt, and noteholders will get a portion of new
bonds, some denominated in U.S. dollars, others in pesos.  
 Retail Stores, Restaurants  
 Founded in 1944, CCM is the holding company for businesses
that make up the third-largest operator of food retailers in
Mexico, del Castillo Elorza said. As of Dec. 31, it had 231
retail stores and 73 restaurants, including Comercial Mexicana,
Bodega Comercial Mexicana, Mega, City Market and Sumesa. It also
operates clubs under the Costco brand in a joint venture with
Costco Wholesale Corp.  
 Operations will continue normally, the company said July 14
in an e-mailed statement to Mexico’s stock exchange.  
 For the fourth quarter of 2009, CCM reported net sales of
approximately 14.441 billion pesos, and had 33,000 people,
according to court papers.
