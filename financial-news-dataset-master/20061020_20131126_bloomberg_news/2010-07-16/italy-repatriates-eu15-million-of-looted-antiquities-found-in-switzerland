             Italian police unveiled some of the
337 pieces of stolen antiquities valued at 15 million euros
($19.5 million) repatriated last month after being recovered in
 Switzerland.   
 The collection includes Greek urns and vases, pieces of
frescoes, bronze statues and marble sculptures produced between
the eighth century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. The items
were illegally excavated in Italy and smuggled out of the
country, police said.  
 “We could make 10 museums abroad with what we’ve brought
back,” General  Giovanni Nistri , head of Italy’s cultural
heritage police, said today at a press conference inside Rome’s
Coliseum, where dozens of the pieces were displayed.  
 Italy has increased efforts to recover ancient artwork that
authorities say was illegally excavated and smuggled abroad. The
campaign led to a dispute between Italy and the J. Paul Getty
Trust over allegedly looted antiquities on display at its  Los
Angeles museum . The Getty agreed in August 2007 to return 40
pieces including a statue of Aphrodite that authorities said was
looted from Sicily.  
 The pieces unveiled today were recovered in a joint
operation with Swiss authorities from an unidentified Japanese
art dealer storing them in Geneva. He turned over the goods
voluntarily after the police provided evidence that they had
been looted from Italy. They were repatriated on June 25 and are
believed to have come from illegal excavations in the regions of
Lazio, Puglia, Sardinia and areas in southern Italy where the
ancient Greeks maintained colonies, the police said in a
statement.
