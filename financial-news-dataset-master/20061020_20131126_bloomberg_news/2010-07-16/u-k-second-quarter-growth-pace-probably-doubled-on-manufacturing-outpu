             The U.K. economy probably doubled
its pace of growth in the second quarter as manufacturing
gathered strength, a survey of economists showed.  
 Gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent, compared with 0.3
percent in the previous three months, according to the median of
32 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey  finished yesterday. The
highest prediction was 0.9 percent at Moody’s Economy.com. The
lowest was 0.1 percent at Natixis.  
 Bank of England policy maker  Andrew Sentance , who pushed
for an interest-rate increase in June, said this week that the
economy’s “gradual healing” is likely to continue. The
majority of policy makers have sought to keep up emergency
stimulus as Britons prepare for the deepest public-spending cuts
since World War II.  
 “We’ve seen strong numbers coming through from the
manufacturing side and the construction numbers seem to be
stabilizing as well,”  Azad Zangana , an economist at Schroder
Investment Management who forecast 0.6 percent growth, said in a
telephone interview. “Growth should probably accelerate. I
should expect to see stronger growth in the third and fourth
quarters.”  
 The Office for National Statistics is due to publish its
preliminary estimate of GDP in the second quarter on July 23.
