             A Chinese property tax won’t curb
real estate prices as speculators will not be affected by the
tax, the Xinhua News Agency cited central bank adviser Li Daokui
as saying.  
 The country should not change the basic direction of its
property policy and should increase local government revenue
sources and incentives to encourge more development of
affordable housing, Li said, according to the report.
