             Hong Kong’s Travel Industry Council
is investigating a tour guide and travel agency after a video
shows the woman hurling insults at tourists for not spending
enough money, the South China Morning Post reported, citing
Council Chairman Michael Wu.  
 The guide threatened to lock the tourists out of their
hotel rooms because she said they hadn’t bought enough from a
jewelry store in the city, according to the Morning Post. The
woman told the visitors that while it’s fine to poor in China
it’s not in Hong Kong, the newspaper reported.  
 The council has requested the name of the woman and the
travel company she works for from Guangdong satellite TV and the
province’s tourism authority so it can take action, the
newspaper quoted Wu as saying.
