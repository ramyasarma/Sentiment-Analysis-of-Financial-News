             Asian naphtha led a decline in
gasoil and fuel oil swaps as the light product’s crack spread
weakened, reflecting increased refining losses.  
 Benchmark Japan open-specification naphtha forwards for
second-half August delivery were bid at $622.50 a metric ton
against offers at $625.50 at 11:30 a.m. Singapore time,
according to broker Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. That’s more
than 1 percent below yesterday’s close of $631.25. Singapore
naphtha swaps were at $6.14 a barrel below Dubai crude, the
Asian benchmark, the biggest discount this week. At a  premium ,
the crack spread would signal refining profit.  
 Oil was little changed in New York after dropping for a
second day amid concern the global economic expansion may slow
and curb fuel demand. U.S. manufacturing contracted in June by
the most in a year and wholesale prices declined more than
anticipated, underscoring the Federal Reserve’s reduced
forecasts for economic growth and inflation.  
 Gasoline’s premium to naphtha was at $11.95 a barrel
yesterday after reaching a one-year high of $12.60 on July 12,
based on Bloomberg calculations. A wide  reforming margin  shows
the motor fuel is more profitable than naphtha.  
 Gasoil , or diesel, swaps for August declined for a second
day, losing 35 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $85.60 a barrel,
according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates. The product is
set for a 0.1 percent drop this week. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai
crude was at $11.16, ending a three-day pullback. This  crack
spread  is a measure of refining profit.  
 Aviation Fuel Profit  
 Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising
yesterday to $1.10 a barrel, PVM said. A widening  regrade 
indicates aviation fuel is more profitable than diesel.  
 August  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps slipped 25 cents to $455
a ton, the lowest in three days, according to PVM. The product’s
 discount  to Dubai crude was at $4.44 a barrel, signaling
continued refining losses.  
 The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising yesterday to $7.75 a ton, the
highest since July 7, PVM data showed. A widening  viscosity
spread  indicates bunker prices declined more than higher-quality
fuel oil cargoes.
