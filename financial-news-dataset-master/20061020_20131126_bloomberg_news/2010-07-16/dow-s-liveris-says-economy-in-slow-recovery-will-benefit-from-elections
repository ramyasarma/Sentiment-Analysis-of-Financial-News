             Dow Chemical Co.  Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Liveris  said the U.S. economy is in a “slow
recovery period” and will benefit from “optimistic” rhetoric
on job creation heading into November elections.  
 The U.S. seems to have avoided a double-dip recession as
“prudent interventions” aid the recovery, Liveris said today
in an interview in New York.  
 “We are still living in this kind of opaqueness that
should worry us all,” said the CEO of the biggest U.S. chemical
maker. “We are in a slow recovery that has a lot of zigs and
zags.”  
 Liveris, who last month warned investors to “stop
panicking” about the economy, said U.S. elections will provide
a psychological boost as politicians running for office talk
optimistically about their ability to create jobs. That’s a
“natural stimulus” that will improve consumer confidence and
spur spending, he said.  
 “Politicians will try to get elected, so I think we are
going to get some talking back up,” Liveris said. “I need some
optimism out there.”  
 U.S. consumer confidence fell in July to the lowest level
in a year, according to today’s Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary  index  of consumer sentiment.  
 Dow, based in Midland, Michigan, fell $1.46, or 5.5
percent, to $25.17 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  The shares  have declined 8.9 percent this
year.  
 Dow is the world’s second-biggest chemical company behind
Germany’s  BASF SE .
