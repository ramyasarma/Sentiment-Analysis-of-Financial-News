             Kinder Morgan Inc. , the Houston-
based pipeline company taken private in a $22 billion leveraged
buyout three years ago, is proceeding with plans for an initial
public offering, said people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Kinder Morgan, backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s buyout
fund and Carlyle Group, held interviews this week with banks
seeking to underwrite the share sale, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the process is private.
Billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Richard Kinder  owns about a
third of the company.  
 The 2007 buyout of Kinder Morgan, whose other backers
include American International Group Inc. and Riverstone
Holdings LLC, is the sixth-biggest LBO in history. Buyout firms
are using IPOs to return money to investors after a two-year
drought in deal-making. Distributions to private-equity clients
last year fell to the lowest level since at least 2000,
according to London-based research firm Preqin Ltd.  
 Kinder Morgan spokesman  Larry Pierce  declined to comment,
as did Carlyle spokesman  Christopher Ullman  and Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman  Andrea Rachman .  
 Kinder Morgan operates or owns interests in 37,000 miles of
pipelines and about 180 terminals, handling natural gas and
other hydrocarbons. It owns the general partner interests in
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, which has a market value of
$20.9 billion.  
 Investors in Kinder Morgan probably had gains of at least
126 percent on a pretax basis,  Andy DeVries , an analyst at
CreditSights Inc. in New York, estimated in April. That
translates to a return of about $10 billion on an initial equity
investment of about $7.8 billion.  
 Carlyle Return  
 Carlyle Partners IV’s $840.7 million investment in Kinder
is now worth $1.3 billion, according to an investor letter
updating clients on the fund’s first-quarter performance.  
 Kinder, 65, founded Kinder Morgan with a group of investors
in 1997 after being passed over for the top job at Enron Corp.,
turning a $40 million initial investment into one of the largest
U.S. pipeline operators. Kinder’s personal wealth is about $3.6
billion, Forbes Magazine estimates.  
 Buyout firms, which spent $2 trillion on leveraged
takeovers during the credit-market bubble, announced the biggest
stock sales in the second quarter, accounting for at least 50
percent of the deals filed with the SEC.  
 HCA Inc., the hospital chain taken private in 2006 for $33
billion including debt, filed for an IPO in May valued at as
much as $4.6 billion, which would be the biggest U.S. initial
offering in two years. Nielsen Holdings BV, taken private in an
8.9 billion-euro ($11.5 billion) LBO in 2006, is planning to
raise $1.75 billion.  
 Pipeline Operators  
 Energy pipeline operators may offer a less risky, more
stable investment than other energy assets as they transport
crude oil, refined products, natural gas and other petroleum
products through their pipelines on set shipping schedules.  
 In most cases, shipping fees are based on the volume of
product transported, not on the price of oil or natural gas.
Competition among pipeline operators is limited as most don’t
have overlapping routes, and with demand for natural gas and oil
products growing there is room to expand.  
 The pressure of rising demand for fuel and limited space in
which to transport it led Colonial Pipeline Co. last month to
gauge interest from shippers about expanding its main gasoline
and distillate lines. The company operates the largest pipeline
linking U.S. Gulf Coast oil refiners to East Coast markets.
