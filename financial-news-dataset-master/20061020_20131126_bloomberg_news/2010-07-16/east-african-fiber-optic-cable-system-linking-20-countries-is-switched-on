             The East African Submarine System, a
fiber-optic cable that will provide greater access to high-speed
Internet and mobile-phone data services in 20 African nations,
was switched on today, the operator said.  
 “It’s gone live,” James Wekesa, chief commercial officer at
the West Indian Ocean Cable Co., said in a phone interview from
Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.  
 Alcatel-Lucent SA , the Paris-based telecommunications-
equipment maker, signed a contract in 2007 with Eassy, as the
project is known, to lay a 10,000-kilometer (6,215-mile)
submarine cable along Africa’s east coast from South Africa to
 Sudan . The project will officially be handed over to West Indian
Ocean Cable, known as WIOCC, on July 21, Wekesa said.  
 Eassy will compete with Seacom, a fiber-optic link owned by
Mauritius-based Seacom Ltd. that went live in July 2009. Eassy
is a so-called super cable and provides transmission speeds of
as much as 1.4 terabytes per second, compared with 1.28
terabytes per second on Seacom. It also provides a backup system
for international connectivity on the east coast of Africa.  
 WIOCC, is owned by a group of 14 African telecommunications
companies and funded by the International Finance Corp., the
African Development Bank, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau of
Germany and the French Development Agency, according to its
website. Other investors include British Telecommunications Plc,
France Telecom SA and Telkom South Africa Ltd.  
 The project was estimated to cost $247 million, according
to Eassy’s website.
