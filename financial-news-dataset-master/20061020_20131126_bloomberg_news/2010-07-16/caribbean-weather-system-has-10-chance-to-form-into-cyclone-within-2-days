             An area of clouds and showers over
the central and southwestern Caribbean Sea has a 10 percent
chance of forming into a tropical system in the next two days,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  
 The weather system stretches from just south of Cuba to the
coasts of Panama and Colombia, taking in Jamaica and parts of
Haiti, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica, according to a map on
the center’s  website . The system is south of where  BP Plc  is
trying to stem and clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 “Additional development of this system, if any, will be
slow to occur as it moves slowly westward,” the center said.  
 The June 1-Nov. 30 Atlantic hurricane season is typically
most active in August and September. This year, one named storm
has formed so far, Hurricane Alex, which slammed into
northeastern Mexico on June 30.
