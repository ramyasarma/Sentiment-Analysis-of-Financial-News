             Mattel Inc. , the world’s largest
toymaker, fell the most in 17 months after fees from a lawsuit
and higher personnel costs increased expenses in the second
quarter and profit trailed analysts’ estimates.  
 Mattel dropped $2.19, or 9.5 percent, to $20.81 at 4:15
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , the largest decline since
February 2009. The stock has advanced 4.2 percent this year.  
 “Increased SG&A expenses didn’t allow the strength of top
line to reach the bottom line,” said  Robert Carroll , an analyst
for UBS Securities in New York, who recommends buying Mattel
shares.  
 Mattel’s second-quarter net income rose to $51.6 million,
or 14 cents a share, from $21.5 million, or 6 cents, a year ago,
the El Segundo, California-based company said today in a
statement. That compared with the 15-cent average of analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Fees related to the toymaker’s lawsuit with MGA
Entertainment Inc. and incentive and severance pay increased
administration expenses by $34.5 million.  
 The toymaker’s sales rebounded along with consumer spending
as purchases at U.S. retailers from April to June climbed 6.8
percent from a year ago, according to the Commerce Department.
Revenue in the quarter ended June 30 increased 13 percent to
$1.02 billion from $898.2 million, boosted by a 17 percent gain
in the U.S.  
 ‘Toy Story’ License  
 Mattel Chief Executive Officer  Bob Eckert  acquired the
“Toy Story” license in 2008 and released a line of products
last year. The third installment has become the highest grossing
in the U.S. this year since its release a month ago.  
 Revenue from the entertainment unit, which includes “Toy
Story,” soared 60 percent from a year ago when the company
lacked a product line tied to a summer blockbuster film. Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. analyst  Drew Crum  raised his estimate for revenue
from the “Toy Story” line to $300 million last week.  
 The toymaker expects retailers that sell its products to
keep inventories tight through the holiday season, Eckert said.  
 “I don’t think anybody thinks we are back to good growth
in the macro economy,” Eckert said on a conference call with
analysts. “I don’t think anybody is building inventories in
anticipation of renewed consumer spending.”
