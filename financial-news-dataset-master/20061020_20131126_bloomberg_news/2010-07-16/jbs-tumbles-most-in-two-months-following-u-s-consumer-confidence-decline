             JBS SA , the world’s biggest beef
producer, fell the most in two months after U.S. confidence
tumbled in July to the lowest level in a year.  
 JBS, based in Sao Paulo, declined 5.1 percent to close at 8
reais at 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest loss since May 7.
About 60 percent of JBS’s revenue comes from the U.S., according
to  Caue Pinheiro , an analyst at brokerage SLW Corretora in Sao
Paulo.  
 “The drop in consumer confidence was a lot lower than
expected, which weighs a lot on the stock, because JBS has a lot
of operations in the U.S.,” Pinheiro said. “The expectation is
that it won’t grow as much, that it will be affected by this.”  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S. consumer sentiment decreased to 66.5 in July, the
lowest since August, and less than the most pessimistic forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 JBS had its debt rating raised by Standard & Poor’s today
to BB from B+, citing cost savings from acquisitions.  
 Marfrig Alimentos SA , Latin America’s second-largest beef
producer, fell 2.1 percent to 17.58 reais.
