             Artworks from the estate of the late
actor  Dennis Hopper , a self-described “gallery bum,” will be
auctioned by Christie’s on Nov. 10 and 11 in New York.  
 The collection is studded with works by Warhol and
Basquiat. The specific pieces are still being determined by the
auction house, yet the group is expected to sell for more than
$10 million. Hopper died of prostate cancer in May at the age of
74.  
 “It’s an artist’s collection, it’s not the collection of a
banker or mogul. It’s the collection of a creative artist,”
said Marc Porter, chairman of Christie’s Americas.  
 Sale highlights so far include Warhol’s 1971 “Portrait of
Dennis Hopper,” representing the actor as a soulful cowboy in
blues and grays. The 40-inch-square canvas is expected to sell
for as much as $1.2 million.  Jean-Michel Basquiat ’s densely
filled 1987 “Untitled,” in acrylic, oil stick and graphite,
has a high pre-sale estimate of $7 million. The painting had
hung in the living room of Hopper’s  Frank Gehry-designed Venice Beach , California, home.  
 Hopper said in a 1999 interview that he had paid $17,000
for the painting around 1988, just before Basquiat’s death.
Hopper claims he was offered $1 million for the same painting
two months after Basquiat’s death.  
 Hopper’s interest in the arts, according to Christie’s,
stemmed from his friendship with actor  James Dean , with whom he
acted in the 1955 “Rebel Without a Cause.”  
 In a press release, Christie’s quoted Hopper saying: “I am
just a middle-class farm boy from Dodge City. I thought
painting, acting, directing and photography was all part of
being an artist. I have made my money that way and I have had
some fun. It has not been a bad life.”  
 Hopper took up photography, shooting his own celebrity-
filled world. This summer “Dennis Hopper Double Standard,” a
chronicle of Hopper’s own photos is on view at the Los Angeles
Museum of Contemporary Art. Painter  Julian Schnabel , a longtime
friend of Hopper’s, curated the show.  
 Hopper’s art collecting began in the 1950s and he preferred
the new and brash, selecting works by Claes Oldenburg,  Richard Prince ,  John Baldessari , Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and  Robert Rauschenberg .  
 “My idea of collecting is not going out and buying
bankable names but buying people that I believe are really
contributing something to my artistic life,” said Hopper in the
1999 interview.  
 At the time of his death, Hopper was enmeshed in a
contentious divorce with his fifth wife, Victoria Duffy. His
acting credits also include “Easy Rider,” and “Apocalypse
Now.”
