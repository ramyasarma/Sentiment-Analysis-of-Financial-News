             Pakistan’s current account deficit
narrowed to its lowest in five years as exports increased and
remittances surged to a record.  
 The  deficit  in the year ended June 30 narrowed to $3.51
billion from $9.26 billion a year earlier, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Karachi-based State Bank of Pakistan,
the nation’s central bank. The gap is the lowest since 2005,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Pakistan is seeking to boost exports and reduce the fiscal
deficit to sustain growth in a country where the World Bank
estimates a quarter of the population lives on less than a
dollar a day. Exports increased 3 percent while remittances from
Pakistanis living in the U.S., U.A.E and the U.K. surged 14
percent in the fiscal year.  
 Pakistan’s trade deficit narrowed by 22.7 percent in June
as exports climbed and imports fell.  
 The trade gap narrowed to $1.41 billion in the last month
of the fiscal year, from $1.82 billion a year ago, according to
a faxed statement from the Commerce Ministry in Islamabad on
July 14.  
 Overseas Pakistani workers sent back $8.91 billion in the
year ended June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan said in a
statement on July 9.
