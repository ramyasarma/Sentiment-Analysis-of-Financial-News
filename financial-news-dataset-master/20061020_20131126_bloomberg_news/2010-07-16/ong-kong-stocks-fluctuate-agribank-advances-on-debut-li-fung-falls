             Hong Kong stocks  fluctuated after
the U.S. reported manufacturing declined, heightening concern an
economic recovery may falter. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.
advanced on its debut.  
 Li & Fung Ltd., the biggest supplier to retailers including
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., slid 1.1 percent.  Agricultural Bank ,
China’s largest by customers, gained 2.2 percent on its first
day of trading in Hong Kong. HSBC Holdings Plc, which gets 20
percent of its revenue from North America, climbed 1.2 percent
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. settled a federal government
fraud lawsuit.  
 “This volatility will continue,”  Geoff Lewis , head of
investment services at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “But it’s not a double-dip
recession. Those fears are exaggerated.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  slid 0.1 percent to 20,229.88 as of
2:44 p.m. local time, extending its decline this week to 0.7
percent. The benchmark rose as much as 0.3 percent today.  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies declined 0.4 percent to 11,377.32.  
 The Hang Seng Index has slid 7.5 percent this year as
China’s efforts to cool its property market and Europe’s debt
crises dented confidence in a global economic recovery. Stocks
on the gauge trade at  13.4 times  estimated earnings, Bloomberg
data show.  
 Futures on the index gained 0.2 percent to 20,224. Twenty-
two stocks dropped while 16 climbed among the measure’s 43
constituents.  
 Li & Fung  
 Li & Fung  slid 1.1 percent to HK$36.65. Esprit Holdings
Ltd., a global fashion retailer, fell 1.1 percent to HK$43.50.
Cosco Pacific Ltd., Asia’s third-biggest container-terminal
operator, declined 1.2 percent to HK$9.64.  
 U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in June, a Federal
Reserve report showed yesterday. That’s the biggest contraction
in a year. Producer prices slid 0.5 percent after falling 0.3
percent in May, the Labor Department said.  
 Agricultural Bank gained 2.2 percent to HK$3.27 on its Hong
Kong debut, a day after its stock started trading in Shanghai,
where it recorded the smallest first-day gain among the nine
lenders that have sold shares in the city in the past four years.  
 The stock, which closed 0.8 percent higher than its initial
public offering price in Shanghai yesterday, slid 0.4 percent
today.  
 HSBC advanced 1.2 percent to HK$75.80.  
 Zijin Mining  
 Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million and change its
business practices to settle U.S. regulatory claims it misled
investors in collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages. The penalty is the largest ever levied by the
Securities and Exchange Commission against a Wall Street firm,
it said yesterday.  
 Goldman Sachs was also sued by Cambridge Place Investment
Management Inc., a Boston area-based fund, seeking reimbursement
for losses related to subprime loans. The suit also names HSBC,
among dozens more banks and brokerages.  
 Bank of Communications Co. slid 2.2 percent to HK$8.31, the
biggest drop on the Hang Seng Index. The bank, part-owned by
HSBC, said it raised HK$17.8 billion in an H-share rights issue.  
  Zijin Mining Group Co.  plunged 5.2 percent to HK$4.57
after China’s No. 1 gold producer said three managers were
detained for a police investigation into an acid spill.
