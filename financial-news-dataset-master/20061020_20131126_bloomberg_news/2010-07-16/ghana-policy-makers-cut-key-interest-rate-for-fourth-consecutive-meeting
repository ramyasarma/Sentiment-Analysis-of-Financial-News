             Ghana’s central bank cut its
benchmark interest rate for the fourth consecutive meeting of
the monetary policy committee after the inflation rate fell
below 10 percent for the first time since December 2007.  
 The key lending rate was lowered to 13.5 percent from 15
percent, Bank of Ghana Governor  Kwesi Amissah-Arthur  told
reporters today in the capital, Accra. All six economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a rate cut.  
 “The MPC does not expect a significantly altered path for
inflation in the second half,” Amissah-Arthur said. “Inflation
is expected to remain broadly around the central target of 9.2
percent.”  
 The inflation rate fell to 9.5 percent in June, the 12th
consecutive decline, compared with a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June last year. Price growth slowed after Ghana’s
currency, the cedi, halted its decline against the dollar last
year. After falling 15 percent in the first six months of 2009,
the cedi has gained 3 percent over the past 12 months.  
 “The outlook on inflation is favorable and the cedi too
has been fairly stable the whole year,” said Collins Appiah,
head of research at Accra-based Gold Coast Securities, who
forecast a 1-point cut.  
 On March 31, central bank Governor  Kwesi Amissah-Arthur 
said inflation is likely to end the year between 9.2 and 9.5
percent.  
 Slowing inflation prompted Amissah-Arthur to make the
central bank’s first rate cut in almost three years in November,
lowering it by 0.5 percentage-point to 18 percent. A second cut
to 16 percent followed in February and a third to 15 percent in
April, in an attempt to get commercial banks to lower their own
lending rates.  
 On April 16, Amissah-Arthur said the average bank rate fell
0.6 percentage point to 32.1 percent following the February cut.
