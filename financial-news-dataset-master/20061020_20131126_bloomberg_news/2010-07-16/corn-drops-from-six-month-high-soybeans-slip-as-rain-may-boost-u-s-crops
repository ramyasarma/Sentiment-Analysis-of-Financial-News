             Corn fell from a six-month high and
soybeans dropped on speculation that rain and lower temperatures
next week in the Midwest will ease concern that U.S. crops would
be damaged by unusually hot, dry weather.  
 Almost 90 percent of the fields north of a line from Omaha,
Nebraska, to Columbus, Ohio, will receive as much as 3 inches
(7.6 centimeters) of rain next week, said  Drew Lerner , the
president of World Weather Inc. Moisture in the past 24 hours
improved crop conditions from central Illinois to Ohio, and the
forecast is for no lasting heat and frequent thunderstorms
during the next two weeks in most growing areas, Lerner said.  
 “The forecasts are less threatening today, after big
rallies this week on weather concerns,” said  Charles Sernatinger , a vice president for ABN Amro Clearing Americas LLC
in Chicago. “Some people are going to be taking some money off
the table before the weekend.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $4.0425 a bushel at 10:28 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after yesterday touching $4.10, the highest price for
a most-active contract since Jan. 12. Before today, corn surged
18 percent since June 29, the day before the government said
that U.S. farmers planted less this year than they had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.75 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $9.8525 a bushel in Chicago, after touching
$9.9275, the highest level since May 5.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show. The U.S. is the biggest producer and exporter of both
crops.
