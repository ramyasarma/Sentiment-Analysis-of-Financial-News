             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
biggest retailer, plans to sell 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion)
of Samurai bonds on July 21, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the matter.  
 The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company told investors it
will price 60 billion yen of five-year, fixed-rate bonds to
yield 30 basis points more than the yen swap rate, said the
person, who asked not to be named as the information is private.  
 Wal-Mart also plans to sell 30 billion yen of five-year,
floating-rate bonds that yield 45 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate for yen, and 10
billion yen of 10-year, fixed-rate notes that yield 40 basis
points more than the yen swap rate, the person said.  
 “Samurai investors want high-profile borrowers,” said
 Katsuyuki Tokushima , a fixed-income analyst at NLI Research
Institute, a unit of Nippon Mutual Life Insurance Co. “Even
Japanese retailers can’t usually sell 10-year bonds. This shows
confidence in Wal-Mart.”  
 Sales of Samurai bonds, or yen-denominated notes sold in
Japan by overseas borrowers, dropped 20 percent to 657 billion
yen this year as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis roiled investors,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield 
investors demand to own Samurai bonds instead of similar-
maturity Japanese government debt averaged 139 basis points
yesterday compared to a record 503 basis points on March 31,
2009, according to an index compiled by Nomura Securities Co.  
 Consumer Bonds  
 Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s largest consumer products
company, raised 100 billion yen from global bonds on May 13. The
maker of Gillette razors priced five-year, 0.95 percent notes at
a 28 basis point spread, Bloomberg data show.  
 Wal-Mart sold Samurai bonds in 2008 and 2009. It raised 100
billion yen last year from sales including five-year, 1.49
percent bonds priced at a 55 basis point spread, and similar-
maturity floating-rate notes yielding 60 basis points more than
the six-month London interbank offered rate.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. are arranging
Wal-Mart’s new sales, according to a July 12 filing with Japan’s
Finance Ministry. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
