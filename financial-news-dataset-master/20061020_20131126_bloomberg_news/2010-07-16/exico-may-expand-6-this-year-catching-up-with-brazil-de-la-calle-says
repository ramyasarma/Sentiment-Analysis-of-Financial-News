             Mexico’s economy may expand 6
percent this year as domestic demand increases, said  Luis de la Calle , the Mexican economist who helped negotiate the North
American Free Trade Agreement.  
 The pace of Mexico’s economic expansion will gain on
Brazil’s growth as domestic consumption picks up in the second
half of the year, said de la Calle, who is now a partner at
Mexico City-based business adviser De la Calle, Madrazo, Mancera
SC, speaking in an interview yesterday.  
 The economist’s call pits him against the average forecast
of 30 Mexican economists  surveyed  by the central bank, who
expect 4.4 percent gross domestic product growth in 2010,
according to the July 1 report. In the first quarter, Mexico’s
GDP expanded 4.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with
Brazil’s 9 percent first-quarter GDP expansion. De la Calle
points out that few economists came close to accurately
forecasting Mexico’s 6.5 percent plunge in GDP last year.  
 “Growth between Brazil and Mexico won’t be as different as
people think,” de la Calle said. “Everyone that’s saying 4
percent, 4.5 percent -- they were all wrong about the
contraction, too.”  
 Brazil’s economy, Latin America’s largest, may grow 7.1
percent this year, compared with 4.5 percent growth in Mexico,
the International Monetary Fund forecast this month.  
 Mexico’s domestic demand has lagged behind as exports drive
the recovery from last year’s contraction, the worst since the
1930s. Mexican retail sales fell 0.1 percent in April from the
same month a year earlier, the country’s statistics agency said
June 18. The agency will report May retail sales July 21.  
 The peso fell 1.3 percent to 12.9382 at 12:47 p.m. New York
time from 12.7720 yesterday. The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent
peso bond due 2024 fell one basis point to 6.93 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
to 127.89 centavos per peso.
