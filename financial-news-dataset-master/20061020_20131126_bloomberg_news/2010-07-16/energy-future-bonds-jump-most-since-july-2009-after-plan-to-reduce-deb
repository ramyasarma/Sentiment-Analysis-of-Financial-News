             Energy Future Holdings Corp.  bonds
jumped the most since July 2009 after the electricity provider
formerly known as TXU Corp. said it’s seeking to swap bonds at a
discount to help cut $38 billion of outstanding debt.  
 Energy Future’s 11.25 percent notes due in 2017 rose 3.25
cents to 69.25 cents on the dollar as of 10:42 a.m. in New York
after earlier jumping as much as 4.75 cents to 70.75 cents, the
biggest gain since last July 31, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  
 The securities have climbed from 62 cents in May as the
 utility  has been seeking to reduce debt and extend maturities
after private-equity firms KKR & Co. and TPG Capital acquired
the company for $43.2 billion in the biggest buyout ever before
a collapse in credit markets.  
 Units of the Dallas-based company are offering to exchange
11.25 percent toggle bonds due in 2017 and the 10.875 percent
notes due 2017 for as much as $2.18 billion of 10 percent notes
due 2020 and $500 million in cash, according to a statement
distributed today by Business Wire.  
 “We are taking advantage of current market conditions to
reduce our debt, projected interest expenses and extend
maturities,”  Lisa Singleton , an Energy Future spokeswoman, said
in a telephone interview.  
 If this is successful, it would reduce consolidated debt
outstanding by up to $900 million and would also cut projected
interest expenses through 2014 by $1 billion, Singleton said.  
 The company will release additional financial information
on Aug. 3, she said.
