 “Investors taking ‘buy’ positions anticipate better

operations in seven African nations, dropped the most this
month, falling 10 cents, to 0.9 percent, to 10.80 shillings.  
 KenolKobil has served notice to Kenya Petroleum Refineries
Ltd. that an arbitrator has been appointed to help resolve a
dispute over the validity of their crude processing agreement,
KenolKobil Chairman  Jacob Segman  said in a statement e-mailed by
the Nairobi Stock Exchange after the market closed yesterday.
The claim for 4.98 billion shillings ($61 million) includes loss
of business, the statement said.  
 Wema Bank Plc  (WEMABANK NL), a Nigerian lender bailed out
by the country’s central bank, gained 4 kobo, or 4.9 percent, to
85 kobo, the biggest increase in three months.  Bank PHB Plc 
(PLATINUM NL) rallied 5 okobo, or 3.7 percent, to 1.40 naira,
the highest close since July 8, while  Union Bank Plc  (UBN NL)
climbed for a second day, rising 12 kobo, or 2.5 percent, to 5

 Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said the bank will only
liquidate the companies if shareholders fail to find new funding
sources. Injecting fresh capital through “strategic partnership
remains the best option,” Sanusi said yesterday, according to a
statement on the website of the regulator today. He also
“allayed the fears of stakeholders, making it very clear that
the CBN would not sell the banks.”
