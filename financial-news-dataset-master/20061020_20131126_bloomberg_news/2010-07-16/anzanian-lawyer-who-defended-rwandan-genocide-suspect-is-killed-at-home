             A Tanzanian lawyer who defended a
Rwandan genocide suspect was shot dead and documents were stolen
from his vehicle in an attack in which two other people died,
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said.  
 Jwani Mwaikusa, 58, was killed at the gate of his home at
10.30 p.m. on July 13 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial
hub, tribunal spokesman Roland Amoussouga said in a phone
interview today. Mwaikusa’s 25-year-old nephew and an
unidentified neighbor were also shot dead, he said.  
 “He was confronted by people and they shot him twice, once
in the head and the chest,” Amoussouga said. “The nephew
struggled with one of the assailants and he was killed on the
spot. There was a commotion and one of the neighbors that came
out was also killed.”  
 Mwaikusa was the lead lawyer for Yussuf Munyakazi, who was
found guilty on July 1 by the  United Nations-backed tribunal  of
genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. As many
as 800,000 people, more than a 10th of Rwanda’s population, died
in a 100-day slaughter of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus by
ethnic-Hutu militias in 1994.  
 Police are investigating Mwaikusa’s death, Amoussouga said.  
 “The police are putting in extra resources because he was a
leading professor of law in Tanzania and very, very effective,”
Amoussouga said. “It’s sad because he was a great man.”  
 Mwaikusa was a professor of law at the University of Dar es
Salaam, according to  statement  on its website.
