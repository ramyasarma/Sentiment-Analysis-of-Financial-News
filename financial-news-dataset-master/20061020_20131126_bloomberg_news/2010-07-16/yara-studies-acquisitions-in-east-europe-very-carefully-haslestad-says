             Yara International ASA, the largest
publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker, said it’s interested
in acquiring assets “all over the world” and particularly in
eastern Europe.  
 “We are interested and we will look at all assets that come
up for sale,” Chief Executive Officer Joergen Ole Haslestad
said today on a conference call. “Eastern Europe is one area
that we’re definitely watching very carefully.”
