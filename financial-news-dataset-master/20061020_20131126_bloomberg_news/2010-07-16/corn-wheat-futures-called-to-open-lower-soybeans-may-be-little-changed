             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts next week call
for less heat and some rain in the Midwest, reducing concern
that the U.S. crop would be damaged, said  Charles Sernatinger , a
vice president for ABN Amro Clearing Americas LLC in Chicago.  
 -- Soybean futures may open up 1 cent a bushel or down 1 cent on
speculation that rain over the weekend will revive crops across
the southern U.S., easing concern that hot, dry weather in
August would hurt Midwest crops, Sernatinger said. Soybean-meal
futures may open steady to 50 cents lower per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is expected to open 0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound
lower.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on concern that prices already reflect the
prospect of lower global production from adverse weather,
Sernatinger said. The price in Chicago jumped 39 percent since
June 9.
