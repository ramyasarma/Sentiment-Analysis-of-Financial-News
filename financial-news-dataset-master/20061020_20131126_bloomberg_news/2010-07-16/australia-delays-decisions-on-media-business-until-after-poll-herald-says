             Australia’s government will delay
two media decisions affecting  News  Corp. until after the
election, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on its website,
citing sources it didn’t name.  
 The government will delay a review on so-called anti-
siphoning laws that govern which sporting events are available
on free-to-air television, the newspaper said. It has also
delayed a decision on whether to put out to contract its
overseas television network, now held by the Australian
Broadcasting Corp., the newspaper said.  
 Both moves will affect  Rupert Murdoch ’s  News , whose Foxtel
network would gain from a relaxation of the anti-siphoning laws
and whose Sky News could bid for the A$20 million ($18 million)
per-year Asia Pacific news service, the paper said.
