             Waha Aerospace BV was given an AA
debt rating by Standard & Poor’s, the credit company’s third-
highest of 10 investment grades, after Abu Dhabi guaranteed the
bond aimed at raising funds for the emirates’ military.  
 The proposed debt, to mature in 2020, “benefits from an
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by the Emirate of Abu
Dhabi,” and was thus assigned the same rating as the emirate,
the biggest and richest of seven that make up the United Arab
Emirates, S&P said in a statement. The guarantee runs to the end
of the bond’s maturity, it said.  
 Netherlands-domiciled Waha Aerospace was set up by Waha
Capital PJSC, an Abu Dhabi-based investment and leasing company,
as a special-purpose entity to issue the bonds, the statement
said. Mubadala Development Co. and Abu Dhabi Investment Co. hold
stakes in Waha Capital, according to Mubadala’s website.  
 S&P’s rating on the bond, which will be used to finance the
purchase of six Boeing Co.’s C-17 transportation aircrafts by
the United Arab Emirates’ armed forces, is subject to final
documentation, the note said.
