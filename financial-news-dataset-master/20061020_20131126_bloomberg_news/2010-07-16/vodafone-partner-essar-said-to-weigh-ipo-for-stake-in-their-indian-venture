             Vodafone Group Plc’s  Indian partner
Essar Group is considering an initial public offering for a
stake in the companies’ Indian venture, according to four people
familiar with the matter.  
 Essar has invited banks to advise on options including
selling part of its 33 percent stake in Vodafone Essar Ltd., the
people said, declining to be identified because the discussions
are confidential. A sale of a 10 percent stake may take place
early next year, two of the people said.  
 Essar has an option to sell its entire stake to Vodafone
for $5 billion or it can sell a smaller stake at an
independently appraised fair market trading value. The window to
sell the stake opened in May for 12 months. Vodafone, the
world’s biggest mobile-phone company, has yet to decide on its
response and is waiting for Essar to make a proposal, one of the
people said.  
 “As a policy we do not comment on market speculation,”
 Manish Kedia , a spokesman at Essar, said by phone today. A
Vodafone spokesman declined to comment via phone yesterday.  
 The 10 percent stake that Essar may sell is valued by
some bankers at between 40 billion rupees ($855 million) and 60
billion rupees, according to one of the people.  
 Cheap Calls  
 Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, bought a 67 percent
stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd. for $10.7 billion in 2007.
Vodafone’s outlook for India soured a year after its entry, when
six new national licenses were awarded.  
 Essar Group , founded by billionaires  Shashi  and  Ravi Ruia ,
may reduce its stake in the telecommunications venture as it
expands its steelmaking, power generation, oil refining, energy
exploration and shipping businesses.  
 Vodafone, which in May booked a $3.3 billion charge at the
unit, has struggled in India after price competition pushed call
rates to among the cheapest in the world. India’s seven largest
operators face rates of less than 1 cent a minute.  
 The overcrowded India market also includes Reliance
Communications Ltd. and Japan’s  NTT DoCoMo Inc.  India’s mobile
market is still growing.  
 New operators “triggered very strong price declines,”
Vodafone Chief Executive Officer  Vittorio Colao  said in May.
“We are recognizing the pricing environment is different from
what we had put in the acquisition business case,” he said at
the time.  
 Vodafone also bid 116.2 billion rupees ($2.48 billion) for
licenses to offer faster wireless services, the Indian
department of telecommunications said in May. Vodafone won
permits for nine regions, including Mumbai and New Delhi, the
nation’s biggest cities with the most expensive permits.
