             Burberry Group Plc , the U.K.’s
largest luxury retailer, will take control of its franchised
stores in China for 70 million pounds ($108 million) in a
transaction that may boost earnings by almost 10 percent.  
 The acquisition of 50 stores and related assets from
franchise partner Kwok Hang Holdings Ltd. will add as much as 20
million pounds to  operating profit  in the year through March
2012, the London-based company said today.  
 “Financially, the deal is excellent,”  Dennis Weber , an
analyst at Evolution Securities in London, said in a note.
Earnings per share may be enhanced by about 6 percent in fiscal
2012, said Weber, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock.  
 Luxury companies are seeking to tap growth potential in
China, where the number of millionaires soared 31 percent last
year, according to research by Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch &
Co. The country’s luxury goods market will be worth $14.6
billion in five years, making it the world’s largest, the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  said in May.  
 Burberry  rose  9 pence, or 1.1 percent, to close at 799.5
pence as of 4:30 p.m. in London trading. The shares have gained
about 33 percent this year, giving the company a market value of
about 3.5 billion pounds.  
 ‘Very Attractive’  
 “This is a very attractive deal from a strategic and
financial perspective, giving us control in a key growth luxury
market,” Chief Executive Officer  Angela Ahrendts  said on a
conference call. “We can see clear opportunities to further
increase sales and profits.”  
 Retail sales in the Chinese stores, which were previously
reported as wholesale revenue, totaled 75 million pounds in the
year through December 2009, generating profit of about 14
million pounds for the local franchisees, Burberry said. Had
Burberry owned the stores in the financial year ended March
2010, retail revenue would have represented 63 percent of total
sales, up from 58 percent without them, Ahrendts said.  
 The value of the gross assets being acquired is about 30
million pounds, according to Burberry, which had group operating
profit of 219.9 million pounds in fiscal 2010, excluding
exceptional costs. The all-cash transaction is due to be
completed later in 2010, the company said.  
 Under the new agreement, Burberry will take over the
outlets’ operational management, while existing franchisees will
hold a 15 percent stake in their business, the company said.
Burberry, which currently has 13 directly operated stores in
Hong Kong, one in Macau and 19 in Taiwan, plans to open 10 more
units in China this year, Ahrendts said.
