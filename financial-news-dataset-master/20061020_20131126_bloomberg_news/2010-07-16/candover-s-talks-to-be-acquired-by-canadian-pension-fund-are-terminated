             Candover Investments Plc, the U.K.
private equity firm in talks to sell itself to a Canadian
pension fund, said negotiations broke down after three months.  
 “Following a request to the potential offerer to clarify
its position, the potential offerer has confirmed to the company
it is no longer considering making an offer,” Candover said in
a statement today.  
 Candover began the talks in April, four months after it was
forced to shut its 3 billion-euro ($3.9 billion) leveraged
buyout fund. Alberta Investment Management Corp. was the bidder,
people with knowledge of the discussions said in April.
A call to Alberta Investment, made today outside of normal
business hours in Alberta, Canada, wasn’t immediately returned.  
 Candover  dropped  0.9 percent to 665 pence as of 9:17 a.m.
in London, giving the company a market value of 145 million
pounds ($222 million).  
 Candover Partners Ltd. shut its fund in January after
Candover Investments, its publicly traded unit, canceled a 1
billion-euro pledge to invest in the pool amid a cash shortage.
The London-based firm slashed 58 percent of its workforce last
year.
