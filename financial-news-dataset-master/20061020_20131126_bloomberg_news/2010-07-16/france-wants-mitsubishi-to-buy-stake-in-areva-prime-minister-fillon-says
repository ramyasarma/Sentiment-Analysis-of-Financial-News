             French Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said his government would welcome Japan’s  Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd.  purchasing a stake in nuclear reactor
manufacturer  Areva SA .  
 “France is very open to Mitsubishi taking a capital stake
in Areva, and thinks it would be a good thing,” Fillon said
today at a press conference in Tokyo with Prime Minister  Naoto Kan . The two met for about 90 minutes, including lunch.  
 Mitsubishi, based in Tokyo, is in talks to buy three
percent of Paris-based Areva for about 50 billion yen ($574
billion), the Yomiuri newspaper said on April 28, without citing
anyone. Mitsubishi, which operates a joint venture with Areva,
said such reports “are not based on our announcement.”  
 The French government has been in talks with Kuwaiti and
Qatari sovereign wealth funds to encourage them to buy shares in
the company, whose finances have been hurt by cost overruns and
construction delays. Standard & Poor’s said on April 14 it may
cut Areva’s  debt rating  unless the company clarifies its  debt-
reduction  plan.
