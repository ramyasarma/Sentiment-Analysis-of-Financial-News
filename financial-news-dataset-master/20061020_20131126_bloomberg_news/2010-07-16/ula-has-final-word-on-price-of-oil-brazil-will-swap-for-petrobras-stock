             Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ’s administration will have the “final word” on the
price of oil reserves that  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  will buy from
the government, Energy Minister  Marcio Zimmermann  said.  
 The government may set a different price on the deepwater
reserves than is recommended in an audit by the National
Petroleum Agency, known as the ANP, Zimmermann said today in a
telephone interview from Guarulhos, outside of Sao Paulo.  
 “There’s a process in which the government will give the
final word,” Zimmermann said. “It will be a price that the
government considers fair with the national interest.”  
 As part of new oil regulations introduced by Lula late last
year, the government plans to swap as much as 5 billion barrels
of deepwater reserves in the so-called pre-salt area for stock
in state-controlled Petrobras. The value of the oil will
determine the size of the company’s planned share sale this
year.  
 The swap and offering are part of plans to finance $224
billion of spending to develop fields including the offshore
Tupi, the Americas’ largest oil discovery since Mexico’s
Cantarell in 1976.  
 Petrobras may need to pay the government as much as $8 a
barrel for reserves, or up to $40 billion, Credit Suisse
analysts led by  Emerson Leite  said in a June 30 investor note.
Earlier this year, the bank predicted Petrobras would pay $5 to
$6 a barrel for the oil, or as much as $30 billion in new stock.  
 ‘Government Property’  
 “You’re talking about a  publicly traded  company that the
government has a stake in; on the other hand, you’re dealing
with government property,” Zimmermann said. “It’s natural
that, within reason, the government would defend its interest.”  
 The ANP said on June 22 it hired Gaffney, Cline &
Associates to assess how much the reserves are worth by the end
of August.  Petrobras  later that day delayed its share sale until
September, saying it needed to wait for the valuation of the
reserves before the public offering.  
 “If the Lula administration were to increase the value of
those barrels significantly above what the auditor’s price
assessment is, the participation in the share issuance will
drop,”  Christopher Garman , the Eurasia Group’s director for
Latin America, said in a telephone interview. “Investors are
looking to this assessment as a reference.”  
 Petrobras’s press office in Rio de Janeiro declined to
comment today on the price of the reserves.  
 $25 Billion  
 Shareholders in a meeting last month authorized a capital
increase of as much as 150 billion reais ($84 billion),
including stock to be issued in exchange for the reserves.
Petrobras has said it expects to raise as much as $25 billion
from minority shareholders.  
 Petrobras  fell 27 centavos, or 1 percent, to 26.84 reais in
Sao Paulo trading as of 5:08 p.m. today. The  stock  has declined
27 percent this year, more than the 9.1 percent drop for
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.
