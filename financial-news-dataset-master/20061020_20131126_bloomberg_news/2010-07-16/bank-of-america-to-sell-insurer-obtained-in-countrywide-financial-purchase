             Bank of America Corp.  plans to sell
the insurance unit it acquired in the purchase of Countrywide
Financial Corp. as Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
seeks to simplify the company and raise funds.  
 “We just today put it on the market,” Moynihan said in a
conference call. “One of the reasons we’re getting rid of these
non-core activities is a restructuring that not only has a value
of capital, but also has a value of a more straightforward
company.”  
 Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, is  selling assets 
as regulators push the company to raise a net $3 billion this
year. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has agreed to
sell its stake in  Banco Santander  SA’s Mexican unit and its
Columbia long-term asset management business.  
 Balboa is one of the largest providers of coverage on
foreclosed homes and properties occupied by distressed
borrowers. Sales have expanded as banks seek to protect their
mortgage collateral and seized houses against storm damage and
vandalism.  Munich Re  and  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. have entered the market for so-called forced-placed
coverage to compete with Balboa and market leader  Assurant Inc.   
 Assurant said in May 2008, before Countrywide was sold to
Bank of America, that it would be interested in buying Balboa.
 Shawn Kahle , a spokeswoman for New York-based Assurant, didn’t
return a call for comment today.  
 “I would imagine that they would still be very, very
interested in Balboa,” said  Steven Schwartz , who covers Assurant
for Raymond James & Associates Inc. “They’re already the
dominant player, but it would eliminate, really, their only
other large competitor in the marketplace.”  
 Mortgage Guarantors  
 Bank of America didn’t name Balboa in a statement today
announcing a second-quarter profit. Balboa had pretax earnings
of about $600 million in 2007, according to Countrywide’s annual
report for that year. In addition to creditor-placed coverage,
Balboa sold voluntary home and auto policies, life insurance
products and reinsurance to mortgage guarantors, according to
the filing.  
 Bank of America joins bailed-out  Citigroup Inc.  and  Ally
Financial Inc. , formerly known as GMAC Inc., in raising money
from insurance units after posting losses on home loans.
Citigroup held a  public offering  for Primerica Inc. in March,
raising more than $300 million. Ally struck a deal last year to
sell its property-casualty insurance business to American
Capital Acquisition Corp.  
 $425 Million  
 Countrywide, which sold itself to Bank of America after
losses on mortgages, bought Balboa in 1999 for $425 million from
Associates First Capital Corp.  
 Assurant slipped 38 cents to $36.58 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Bank of America fell
$1.41, or 9.2 percent, to $13.98 after the company reported
lower profit and revenue and said stock buybacks aren’t
imminent.  
 Moynihan said Bank of America will probably record a gain
on the sale of Balboa and that insurance is “not a core
activity of making mortgages.”  
 Terese Rosenthal , a U.S. based spokeswoman for Munich Re
declined to comment. Buffett didn’t respond to a message left
with an assistant for comment.

                          July 16 (Bloomberg) -- Brian Moynihan, chief executive officer of Bank of America Corp., discusses the company's second-quarter profit reported today. 
     The largest U.S. lender said net income dropped to $3.2 billion, or 28 cents a share before preferred dividends, from $3.22 billion, or 33 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Moynihan, speaking from Charlotte, North Carolina, talks with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television's "InsideTrack." (Source: Bloomberg)
