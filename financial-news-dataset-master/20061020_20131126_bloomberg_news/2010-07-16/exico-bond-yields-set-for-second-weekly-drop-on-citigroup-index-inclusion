             Mexico’s peso bond yields are set to
drop for a second straight week as investors make purchases
before inclusion in Citigroup Inc.’s World Government Bond Index
in October.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 6.94 percent at 9:18 a.m.
New York time, from 7.09 percent on July 9, according to Banco
Santander SA. The price rose 1.53 centavo to 127.78 centavos on
the peso. The yield was little changed today.  
 “The WGBI story is still quite important for Mexico,”
said  Dirk Willer , head of Latin American local markets strategy.
“The actual inclusion into the index will be in October, and
usually you get outperformance in the bonds before that.”  
 The yield on the benchmark bond has dropped 133 basis
points this year.  
 The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.8318 per dollar, from
12.7720 yesterday.
