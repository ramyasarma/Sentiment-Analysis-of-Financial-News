             Vodafone Group Plc’s  Indian partner
Essar Group is considering an initial public offering for a
stake in the companies’ Indian venture, according to three
people familiar with the matter.  
 Essar has invited banks to advise on options including a
public listing for part of its 33 percent stake in Vodafone
Essar Ltd., the people said, declining to be identified because
the discussions are confidential. A share sale may take place
early next year, two of the people said.  
 Essar has an option to sell its stake to Vodafone for $5
billion or it can sell a smaller stake at an independently
appraised fair market trading value. The window to sell the
stake opened in May for 12 months. Vodafone has yet to decide on
its response and is waiting for Essar to make a proposal, one of
the people said.  
 A Vodafone spokesman declined to comment via phone today.
Essar’s spokespeople couldn’t immediately be reached and didn’t
return calls seeking comment outside of business hours.  
 Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, bought 67 percent
stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd. for $10.7 billion in 2007.
Vodafone’s outlook for India soured a year after its entry, when
six new national licenses were awarded.  
 Vodafone, which in May booked a $3.3 billion charge at the
unit, has struggled in India after price competition pushed call
rates to among the cheapest in the world. India’s seven largest
operators face rates of less than 1 cent a minute.  
 Overcrowded Market  
 The overcrowded India market also includes Reliance
Communications Ltd. and Japan’s NTT DoCoMo Inc. India’s mobile
market is still growing.  
 New operators “triggered very strong price declines,”
Vodafone Chief Executive Officer  Vittorio Colao  said in May.
“We are recognizing the pricing environment is different from
what we had put in the acquisition business case,” he said at
the time.  
 Vodafone also bid 116.2 billion rupees ($2.48 billion) for
licenses to offer faster wireless services, the Indian
department of telecommunications said in May. Vodafone won
permits for nine regions, including Mumbai and New Delhi, the
nation’s biggest cities with the most expensive permits.
