             The euro zone is overcoming the
“worst crisis in its history,” which was triggered by debt
and not by a weakness of the single currency, French Prime
Minister  Francois Fillon  said.  
 “The crisis is not a crisis of the euro, it’s a crisis
of sovereign debt, which we are now resolving,” Fillon said
today in Tokyo. The euro is a “permanent” currency, and the
debt and deficits of European countries aren’t as bad as
those of the U.S. or Japan, Fillon said.  
 The euro has depreciated this year against all but one
of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, on concern
the Greek debt crisis will spread to other European nations.
European finance ministers agreed in June on a rescue fund
backed by 440 billion euros ($564 billion) to halt the spread
of the credit woes.
