             Citigroup Inc. , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, said profit dropped 38 percent, beating analysts’
estimates even as stock and bond trading revenue fell. An
improving credit outlook allowed the company to reduce reserves
against future losses.  
 Second-quarter  net income  was $2.73 billion, down from
$4.39 billion in the same period a year earlier, when the New
York-based company had a $6.7 billion gain from the sale of a
stake in Smith Barney. The per-share profit was 9 cents,
Citigroup said today in a statement, exceeding the 5-cent
average estimate of 18  analysts  in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Citigroup, despite the turbulence in the markets, appears
to have turned the corner and its plan is on track,” said  James Ellman , a former Merrill Lynch & Co. bank-stock portfolio
manager who is now president of San Francisco-based hedge fund
 Seacliff Capital . “We’ve seen problem credit-card loans come
down for the industry, which Citi is heavily into.”  
 Stock and bond trading revenue tumbled as Greece’s debt
crisis and a stalled U.S. economy snapped the streak of
profitable trading days that pushed Citigroup’s first-quarter
results to the highest in almost three years. Chief Executive
Officer  Vikram Pandit  signaled in April that results at the
bank, which lost a combined $29 billion in 2008 and 2009, would
“continue to reflect the pace of economic recovery and the
level of activity in capital markets.”  
 Shares Decline  
 The stock fell 26 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $3.90 in New
York Stock Exchange  composite trading  at 4:15 p.m. Citigroup
 surged  to a six-month high of $4.97 in April, only to plunge in
following months as investors bet the market turmoil would
hamper the bank’s recovery.  
 Citigroup’s second-quarter  revenue  was $22.1 billion, down
33 percent from a year earlier. Fixed-income trading revenue
declined 31 percent to $3.7 billion from the first quarter, the
bank said. Stock-trading revenue tumbled 46 percent to $652
million.  
 Investment-banking revenue fell 36 percent to $674 million.
The bank underwrote 62 percent fewer U.S. bond offerings and had
a 16 percent drop in the dollar value of Citigroup-advised
acquisitions and divestitures, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Loan losses in the quarter fell 31 percent to $8 billion.
The company recorded a gain from releasing $1.5 billion from its
reserves for future loan losses.  
 Improving Credit  
 “Credit improved for the fourth consecutive quarter,”
Pandit said in the statement.  
 The bank booked a charge of about $400 million during the
quarter to cover the cost of a bonus tax in the U.K. Last year,
the country imposed the one-time, 50 percent tax on banker
bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds ($40,700).  
 The quarter’s results included a $447 million gain from the
bank writing down the value of its own debt, under an accounting
rule that allows companies to profit when their creditworthiness
declines. The rules reflect the possibility that a company could
buy back its own liabilities at a discount, which under
traditional accounting methods would result in a profit.  
 Prices for Citigroup’s credit-default swaps -- used by
investors to bet on the likelihood a company won’t be able to
repay its debts -- increased by 26 percent during the quarter to
$194,180 per year for $10 million of coverage for five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Double Dip  
 “The whole key is, can the economy avoid a second dip?”
said  Gary Townsend , a former Friedman Billings Ramsey bank
analyst who’s now CEO of Hill-Townsend Capital LLC in Chevy
Chase, Maryland, which oversees $45 million including 150,000
Citigroup shares.  
 Pandit, 53, has said he wants 2010 to show the “earnings
potential of the new Citi” after two straight annual losses.
Following a $45 billion bailout in 2008, the CEO pledged to take
a $1-a-year salary until the bank turns consistently profitable.  
 Citigroup, which repaid $20 billion of the bailout money in
December, is still  18 percent owned  by the U.S. Treasury
Department. The government this year has sold 2.2 billion of the
7.7 billion shares it got from converting $25 billion of the
bailout money into common stock. The U.S. plans to sell the
remaining shares by the end of 2010.
