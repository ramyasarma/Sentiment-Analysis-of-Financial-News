             Germany’s Federal Labor Agency will
need less government cash this year than initially forecast
after the economic recovery gathered steam and unemployment
declined.  
 The agency has revised down its 2010 deficit forecast to
11.3 billion euros ($14.5 billion) from a 14 billion-euro
estimate in April, Labor Agency chief  Frank-Juergen Weise  said
in an interview in Nuremberg on July 14. As a result, the
government will have to subsidize the agency with 8.4 billion
euros rather than 11.1 billion euros, saving 2.7 billion euros
in Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s budget. The agency has
reserves of 2.9 billion euros.  
 “If the economic recovery continues to be good, the
deficit could decline even further,” said Weise, who presented
the new figures to the agency’s board of directors today.
“Overall I’m in a positive mood when it comes to the deficit
development.”  
 German  unemployment  has dropped every month for the past
year and by a total of 261,000, pushing the jobless rate down to
7.7 percent from 8.3 percent. Government stimulus measures
helped keep people in work during last year’s recession, which
was the deepest since World War II. This year, a global recovery
and booming demand for German exports is underpinning
employment.  
 ‘Consequences’  
 The Labor Agency, which is funded by an unemployment
insurance paid by workers, administers German jobless benefits.
The government meets any shortfalls in its budget. In October
last year, the agency predicted a 2010 deficit of 17.9 billion
euros, which would have required a government subsidy of 15
billion euros.  
 “The German  labor market  responded to the crisis better
than feared but the situation remains uncertain,” Weise said.
The economy is still supported by stimulus packages, and moves
by governments worldwide to reduce spending “will have
consequences for us as an export nation,” he said.  
 The Bundesbank on June 11 raised its growth forecasts to
1.9 percent for this year and 1.4 percent for 2011 from 1.6
percent and 1.2 percent respectively.  
 Governments in the 16-nation euro region, Germany’s biggest
export market, are embarking on austerity programs to rein in
excessive budget deficits, threatening to undermine the economic
recovery and jeopardize a continued decline in unemployment.  
 “One mustn’t expect the good development on the labor
market to go on,” Weise said. “The positive trend continues,
but it will weaken.”  
 The agency expects the number of  unemployed people  to
average 3.2 million in 2010, some 200,000 less than it predicted
at the beginning of the year, Weise said. Next year, the number
of jobless people will decline to between 3 million and 3.1
million.  
 “We won’t see a mass of new hires as in previous
upswings,” Weise said. “We expect an increase in employment in
2011 of about 30,000 to 50,000 jobs.”
