             The French Soccer Federation named a
three-man commission to investigate a strike by national team
members during the World Cup tournament in South Africa last
month.  
 Lawyer Laurent Davenas, the former head of the national
soccer league’s disciplinary committee Jacques Riolacci, and
soccer foundation Chairman Patrick Braouezec will interview
staff and players and submit their report by the end of August,
the federation said on its website today.  
 The French squad refused to take part in training on June
20 after striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home following a
dispute with coach Raymond Domenech. Anelka had refused to
apologize after arguing with the coach at halftime in the team’s
2-0 loss to Mexico on June 17.
