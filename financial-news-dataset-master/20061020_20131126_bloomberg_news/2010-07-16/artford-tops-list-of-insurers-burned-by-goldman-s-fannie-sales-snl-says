             Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc.  was the biggest buyer among U.S. insurers of the 2007
Fannie Mae securities offerings that were cited in a lawsuit
against  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , SNL Financial said.  
 Hartford wrote off its $211.1 million investment in Goldman
Sachs’s sales of Fannie preferred stock in September 2007 and
December 2007, Tim Zawacki, an analyst with SNL, said today in a
 report . As a group, insurers spent $1.04 billion on the
securities and reported losses of $802 million, SNL said.  
 Hartford was caught off guard by the 2008 financial crisis
and needed a $3.4 billion U.S. bailout after investments soured.
The insurer’s losses on the Fannie Mae securities were more than
three times those of rival Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., the
Boston-based carrier that sued Goldman Sachs last week and said
the bank misled investors in the offering. In 2008, Fannie Mae
was taken over by the U.S. amid losses on home loans.  
 “Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded the actual
status of Fannie Mae’s capital structure,” Liberty Mutual said
in the complaint. The insurer said it invested about $62.5
million and that the stake became “virtually worthless.”  
 Shannon Lapierre , a spokeswoman for Hartford, didn’t
immediately return a call. Hartford, based in the Connecticut
city of the same name, repaid its government aid in March. Chief
Executive Officer  Liam McGee , who returned the insurer to
profitability after taking over in 2009, said in an interview
last month that the company is relying more on its own
underwriting before buying securities.  
 Allstate, CNA  
 Goldman Sachs had said the offering was for  surplus capital 
when it was actually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain its
business, Liberty Mutual said in its July 8 complaint in Boston
federal court.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said last week that the suit was without merit
“and we will contest it vigorously.”  
 Insurers that invested in the offering lost varying
portions of their capital, depending on whether they sold the
securities and when.  Allstate Corp. , the biggest publicly traded
home and auto insurer, lost $30.9 million of its $70.3 million
investment in the December 2007 sale, while CNA Financial Corp.
lost $44.4 million of the $46 million it spent in the September
offering, according to SNL. NYMAGIC Inc. made a profit of
$400,000 on a $20 million investment in the December sale,
according to Zawacki’s research.  
 Maryellen Thielen , a spokeswoman for Allstate, and  Katrina Parker , a spokeswoman for CNA, had no immediate comment.  
 ‘Significant Problems’  
 Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and
regulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage
markets collapsed during the credit crisis. The New York-based
bank, Wall Street’s most profitable, agreed yesterday to pay
$550 million to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that claimed it sold a collateralized debt
obligation without disclosing that a hedge fund helped pick
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles.  
 At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae
offering, Goldman was aware that there were “significant
problems” in the real estate market and bet its own money
against subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual
said in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the
U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
