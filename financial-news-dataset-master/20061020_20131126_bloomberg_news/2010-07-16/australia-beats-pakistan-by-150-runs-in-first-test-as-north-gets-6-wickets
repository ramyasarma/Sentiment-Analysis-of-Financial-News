             Australia defeated Pakistan by 150
runs in their first Test at Lord’s in London as  Marcus North 
took six wickets today. Pakistan captain  Shahid Afridi  said he
would retire from Test cricket when the series finishes.  
 Pakistan, which was the considered the hosts of the match,
were all out for 289 after a collapse that started when Umar
Akmal was caught by  Michael Clarke  on 22 off a ball from North
just before lunch. That left Pakistan on 216-4 in the 64th over,
and they didn’t last another 30.  
 “It was a good win,” Australia captain  Ricky Ponting  said
after the match, according to Cricinfo.com. “We had to look at
different ways to get wickets. You have to adapt your game in
these conditions.”  
 Australia set Pakistan 440 to win after being bowled out
for 334 yesterday.  Simon Katich  was top scorer with 83.
Australia reached 253 in its first innings, while Pakistan was
held to 148.  
 The hosts reached 150-1 in the run chase as  Salman Butt  and
Azhar Ali shared a 102-run partnership for the third wicket, but
Butt’s dismissal signaled the beginning of a collapse. Marcus
North, who is primarily considered a batsman, took six wickets
for 55 runs in 18.1 overs, his best figures in test cricket.  
 “I injured my side in the Asia Cup and I’m still
struggling,” Afridi said in an interview with Sky Sports. “I
can’t carry it in Test cricket, where you need to be at full
fitness. I’m enjoying one-day and Twenty20 so I’ll concentrate
on that. It’s very difficult playing Tests after four years so
it’s better to leave this cricket.”  
 It’s the first neutral test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan.
