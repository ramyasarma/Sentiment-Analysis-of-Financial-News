             Seven relay teammates of admitted
steroid user  Marion Jones  can keep the medals they won at the
2000 Sydney Olympics, the highest sports court ruled.  
 The appeal by U.S. sprinters  Andrea Anderson , LaTasha
Colander Clark, Jearl Miles-Clark,  Torri Edwards , Chryste
Gaines,  Monique Hennagan  and Passion Richardson to keep their
medals was unanimously upheld, the  Court of Arbitration for
Sport  said in a  news release .  
 Miles-Clark, Hennagan, Colander Clark and Anderson were
part of the U.S. team that won the gold medal in the 1,600-meter
relay. Gaines, Edwards and Richardson were part of the bronze-
medal squad in the 400-meter relay.  
 Jones returned the five medals she won at the Sydney Games
after confessing that she used steroids in 2007. The
 International Olympic Committee  and  International Association of
Athletic Associations , track’s governing body, each ruled that
Jones’s relay teammates also would have to return their medals.  
 “The panel found that at the time of the Sydney Olympic
Games there was no express IOC or IAAF Rule in force that
clearly allowed the IOC to annul the relay team results if one
team member was found to have committed a doping offence,” the
court said in a statement.  
 The IOC said it was preparing a statement and had no
immediate comment on the ruling.  
 There was no rule in place during the Sydney Olympics to
take away medals from relay teammates of athletes found to have
used performance-enhancing drugs. That rule has since been
added. The  United States Olympic Committee  said following
Jones’s admission that her teammates should be forced to return
their medals.  
 ‘May Be Unfair’  
 “The panel, whilst it does not accept to impose a sanction
on the basis of inexistent or unclear rules, acknowledges that
the outcome of this case may be unfair to the other relay teams
that competed with no doped athletes helping their performance;
however, such outcome exclusively depends on the rules enacted
or not enacted by the IOC and by the IAAF at the time of the
Sydney Olympic Games,” the court said.  
 The Lausanne, Switzerland-based tribunal has been the
highest ruling body in sports disputes since 1984.
