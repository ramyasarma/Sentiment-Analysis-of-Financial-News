             National Australia Bank Ltd.  is
seeking more time to win regulatory approval for its A$13.3
billion ($11.7 billion) purchase of Axa Asia Pacific Holdings
Ltd., prolonging an eight-month takeover battle.  
 Australia’s biggest business bank is in talks with co-
bidder Axa SA and investment manager Axa Asia Pacific about
extending the period as it tries to overcome opposition to the
proposal from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,
it said in a statement today.  
 The Melbourne-based bank said June 4 it was in early
discussions with possible buyers of Axa Asia Pacific’s North
investment platform to overturn the ACCC’s competition concerns.
The Australian Financial Review said this month that investment
manager IOOF Holdings Ltd. was close to an agreement to buy the
asset.  
 Without a second extension of a pact between National
Australia Bank, Axa SA and Axa Asia Pacific, which expired
yesterday, any of the companies can terminate the agreement if
the deal remains blocked. That could reopen the door to  AMP Ltd. ,
whose sweetened offer for Axa Asia Pacific was spurned in
December.  
 National Australia Bank plans to keep the Australian and
New Zealand operations of Axa Asia Pacific and sell the Asian
units to French insurer Axa SA. The North platform, an Internet
portal offering investment and pension products, had more than
A$1.2 billion in managed funds at the end of 2009.  
 National Australia Bank  climbed  0.5 percent to A$24.63 at
10:39 a.m. in Sydney trading. Axa Asia Pacific  fell  0.2 percent
to A$5.34.
