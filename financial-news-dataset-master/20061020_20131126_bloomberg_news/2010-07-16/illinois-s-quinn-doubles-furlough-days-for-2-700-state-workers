             Illinois  Governor  Pat Quinn  doubled
to 24 the number of unpaid furlough days for 2,700 managers and
staff members this fiscal year as he cuts spending to close a
budget deficit of about $10 billion.  
 The unpaid days off for non-unionized workers amount to a
9.2 percent cut in compensation, and will save $18 million in
the state’s $24.9 billion budget, Quinn, a Democrat seeking
another term in November, said in a  press release  announcing the
furlough order. Non-unionized employees took 12 unpaid furlough
days in the fiscal year that ended June 30.  
 Quinn’s order comes as he faces criticism from Republicans
in the Legislature for awarding salary increases averaging 11.4
percent to 35 staff members over the past 15 months. Those
raises cost about $300,000 per year,  Kelly Kraft , a spokeswoman
for the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget, said in a
phone interview from Chicago today.  
 “Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures, and
I thank our hard-working state employees for their dedication in
getting Illinois back on track,” Quinn said in the press
release. He encouraged legislative staff and almost 50,000
unionized state workers who aren’t covered by his administrative
order to agree to unpaid time off.  
 Illinois, the fifth-most populous U.S. state, has an A1
credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, matching
 California’s  as the lowest among 50. The  budget  includes plans
to borrow $3.3 billion to begin paying $6 billion in overdue
payments to contractors, and assumes that $3.7 billion in
pension obligations will be funded with debt, a plan that hasn’t
passed the state Senate.  
 Quinn took office last year when former Governor  Rod Blagojevich  stepped down amid a federal corruption
investigation.
