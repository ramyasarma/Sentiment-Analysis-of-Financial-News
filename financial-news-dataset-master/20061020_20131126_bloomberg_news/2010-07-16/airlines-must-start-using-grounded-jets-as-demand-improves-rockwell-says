             U.S. airlines’ flights are so full
that this quarter they will need to start flying jets they had
grounded, said  Clay Jones , chief executive officer at cockpit-
instrument maker Rockwell Collins Inc.  
 That will bolster income for aircraft-maintenance companies
and parts providers, with after-market revenue likely to rise in
the “mid-teens” on a percentage basis in the fourth quarter,
the CEO of the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company said.  
 “You can’t fill the airplane up to 105 percent,” Jones
said in an interview after the company’s earnings report today.
“Airlines will have to bring in more of the out-of-warranty
airplanes, and that’s when we’ll start to see some business.”  
 A revival in business travel is occurring amid airlines’
busiest time of the year, allowing carriers to build cash and
mend their balance sheets. That is also leading to more business
for companies like  Rockwell Collins , which bolstered sales 12
percent in the third quarter ended June 30.  
 The recovery is leading Rockwell Collins to hire again
after cutting  jobs  in the recession. In the 12 months through
Oct. 1, the company will boost its workforce by 2 percent
compared with a year earlier, the CEO said by telephone.  
 “When the airlines are profitable, they spend more money
upgrading their equipment,” Jones said.  
 Rockwell Collins fell $1.90, or 3.4 percent, to $54.16 at
4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have
dropped 2.2 percent this year.
