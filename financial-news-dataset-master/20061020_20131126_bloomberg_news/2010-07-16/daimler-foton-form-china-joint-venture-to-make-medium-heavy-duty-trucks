             Daimler AG , Europe’s biggest
truckmaker, said it signed a formal agreement with  Beiqi Foton
Motor Co.  today to set up a 6.35 billion yuan ($937 million)
venture to make medium and heavy duty trucks in Beijing, as the
two seek to increase sales in the world’s biggest auto market.  
 The trucks will bear the Auman nameplate and use engine
technology from the Stuttgart, Germany-based company’s Mercedes-
Benz unit, Daimler said. The equally held venture will have an
annual production capacity of 100,000 vehicles and 45,000 heavy
diesel engines, it said.  
 “The joint venture offers us an excellent springboard from
which we can achieve growth, profitability and expansion in
China,”  Andreas Renschler , member of Daimler’s management board
and head of Daimler Trucks and Daimler Buses, said in today’s
statement.  
 Companies including Daimler, Nissan Motor Co. and General
Motors Co. are raising capacity in China even as sales growth
slows. Vehicle sales including buses and trucks increased 23
percent last month to 1.41 million, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said July 9, compared to a 48 percent
average growth rate during the first six months.  
 Daimler will also start making passenger-vehicle engines at
its car-making venture with  Beijing Automotive Industry Holding
Co. , Beiqi Foton’s parent, the companies said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Foton also plans to work with Daimler to target overseas
sales as rising competition crimps profit margins in China even
as demand grows. The Chinese company intends to sell 30 percent
of vehicles overseas by 2015, up from 8 percent this year, Vice
President  Zhao Jingguang  said in September.  
 Sales of Mercedes Benz cars in China more than doubled in
the first half to 59,600 units, Daimler said on July 8.
Daimler’s total sales in northeast Asia more than doubled to
73,130 units, the company said.
