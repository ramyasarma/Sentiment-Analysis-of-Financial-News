             Electricite de France SA , Europe’s
biggest power producer, was offered more than 5 billion pounds
($7.7 billion) for its U.K. distribution network, a person with
knowledge of the matter said.  
 The company, based in Paris, got at least two preliminary
bids from Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. and a group
led by Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd., said the person, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private.  
 EDF Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  is considering
selling the network to help reduce debt after the nuclear
utility expanded into the U.K. with the purchase of British
Energy Group Plc in 2008. The company needs to invest billions
of euros at home to maintain France’s 58 atomic reactors.
Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc are advising EDF on the sale.  
 “If they get more than 5 billion pounds, that’s a really
good price and it should fade away the worry that investors have
about their debt,”  John Honore , an analyst at Societe Generale,
said by phone today. EDF is likely to use cash from the sale to
finance plans to build nuclear plants in the U.K., he said.  
 EDF shares fell 1.16 euros, or 3.7 percent, to 30.28 euros
as of 5:30 p.m. in Paris.  
 Abu Dhabi  
 Macquarie is partners with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority
and the Canadian Pension Plan. The group is being advised by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Lexicon Partners and Macquarie Capital
Advisers. Cheung Kong Infrastructure is being advised by RBS
Corporate Finance, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 EDF’s U.K. network delivers power to about 7.8 million
people in London and southeast England. It includes about
170,000 kilometers (105,633 miles) of underground cables and
overhead power lines, as well as 66,300 substations, according
to the company’s  website . EDF valued the regulated part of
network at about 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) at the end of
2008.  
 A third potential bidder, Scottish & Southern Energy Plc,
said last month that it won’t sell shares to fund a purchase,
limiting its potential stake to about 10 percent. The utility
had considered buying 50 percent along with Borealis.  
 An EDF spokesperson in London declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today. Macquarie spokesman Gavin
Winbanks in London declined to comment on market speculation.
 Margot Leong , a spokeswoman for Cheung Kong in Hong Kong, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for information.
