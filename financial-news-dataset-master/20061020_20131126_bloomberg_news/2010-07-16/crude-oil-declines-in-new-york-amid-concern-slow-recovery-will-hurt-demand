             Crude oil fell for a third day in
New York on speculation that the U.S. economic recovery is
slowing, reducing fuel demand in the world’s biggest energy-
consuming country.  
 Oil slipped 0.8 percent and equities tumbled after a
preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to the lowest
level since August. Prices retreated yesterday as manufacturing
in New York and Pennsylvania dropped, part of a nationwide
 decline  in factory production of 0.4 percent in June.  
 “Oil should be a lot lower than it is,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover
Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut. “We’ve had some very bearish
stuff come out about the economy this week.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery slipped 61 cents to settle at
$76.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are
little changed this week.  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement fell 72 cents, or
0.9 percent, to end the session at $75.37 on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 Oil in New York has traded in a range of $8.29 for the past
month, from $71.09 to $79.38 a barrel.  
 “We’re stuck in a $70-to-$80 range and looking for a
strong signal to exit it in either direction,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “It will take evidence that the recovery
is gathering momentum to move us higher, and any signs pointing
to continued sluggishness and weak demand will move us lower.”  
 Consumer Sentiment  
 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
consumer sentiment index for July fell to 66.5 from 76 in June.
The gauge was projected to fall to 74, according to the median
forecast of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Stocks dropped on the slump in consumer confidence and
lower-than-estimated revenue at companies from Bank of America
Corp. to General Electric Co. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
declined 2.3 percent to 10,120.98 at 2:59 p.m. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 2.6 percent to 1,068.20.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported yesterday
that its general economic index fell to 5.1 in July from 19.6
the prior month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index declined to 5.1 this month, the lowest
level since August 2009, from 8 in June.  
 “Oil has tested and failed to break above the 200-day
moving average, which stands at $77.48,” said  Hamza Khan , an
analyst with Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “The market is now moving lower and
will test the 50-day moving average of $74.33. These are the
moving averages that are looked at most.”  
 Technical traders watch for patterns on charts for clues to
price direction, and may sell or buy based on those signals.  
 Reduced Consumption  
 An Energy Department report on July 14 showed that U.S.
fuel demand dropped 4 percent to 18.8 million barrels a day last
week. It was the lowest level since the week ended April 23 and
the biggest drop since March.  
 “Until we see an uptick in demand for petroleum products,
the market should trend lower,” Khan said.  
 The department’s report showed that supplies of gasoline
and distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, increased last week as crude oil stockpiles dropped.
Both crude and fuel stockpiles were above the five-year average
for the period.  
 Gasoline for August delivery slipped 1.21 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.0486 a gallon in New York. Heating oil
for August delivery declined 0.7 cent, or 0.4 percent, to end
the session at $2.0113 a gallon.  
 “We’re in a challenging economic environment and we do
have plenty of oil,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “The recent projections of
2011 demand don’t point to any physical tightness.”  
 Global Demand  
 Global crude demand will rise by 1.05 million barrels a
day, or 1.2 percent, next year to 86.41 million, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said yesterday in
its first assessment for 2011. The Paris-based International
Energy Agency forecast that oil usage will advance 1.3 million
barrels a day, or 1.6 percent, to 87.8 million in 2011.  
 Crude oil may fall next week, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Thirteen of 33 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast crude
will decline through July 23. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted that futures will be little changed and eight saw an
increase. Last week, 53 percent of analysts forecast a gain.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 429,573 contracts as of 2:58
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 680,457
contracts yesterday, 7.5 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.26 million contracts.
