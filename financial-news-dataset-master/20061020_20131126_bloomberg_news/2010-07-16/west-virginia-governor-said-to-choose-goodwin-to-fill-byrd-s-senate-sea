             West Virginia Governor  Joe Manchin 
has decided to name his former general counsel,  Carte Goodwin ,
to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the death of Democratic
Senator  Robert C. Byrd , a Democratic aide familiar with the 
matter said.  
 Manchin, a Democrat who has said he is interested in
running for the seat in a special election, will name Goodwin, a
Charleston lawyer, at a 2 p.m. news conference today in the
state capitol, said the person who spoke on condition of
anonymity.  
 Goodwin’s appointment would restore the Democrats’ 59-41
margin in the Senate, just one vote shy of the supermajority
needed to pass most legislation.  
 Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said yesterday that
Manchin’s appointee will be sworn in on July 20. Minutes later,
the Senate plans to take another vote on whether to restore
unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless. The proposal
fell one vote short on June 30, two days after Byrd died.  
 Manchin called the West Virginia legislature into an
emergency session beginning yesterday to provide legal authority
to call a special election this November to fill the rest of
Byrd’s term through 2012.  
 Goodwin served as Manchin’s general counsel from 2005 to
2009 and afterward returned to his family law firm,  Goodwin &
Goodwin LLP  in Charleston.
