             (Corrects first paragraph to clarify that the proposal
refers to foreign-owned assets in the country’s banks.)  
 Switzerland may tax assets owned by
foreigners in the nation’s banks at the same rate they would pay
in their home countries, Milano Finanza reported, citing
proposals being discussed by the lower house.  
 The proposals are included in a plan put forward by  Fulvio Pelli , head of the Radical Party and chairman of Banca dello
Stato del Canton Ticino, the Milan-based newspaper said.  
 Under the plan, banks would be required to accept only
funds clients previously disclosed to tax authorities, MF
reported.
