             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  advanced for a second day, adding 55.15, or 0.2
percent, to 27,529.83 in Johannesburg. The measure gained 0.9
percent this week, a second of increases.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.  (ACL SJ) fell the most
since July 1, retreating 3.35 rand, or 4.5 percent, to 72 rand.
South Africa’s largest steel producer said it will close its
Saldanha mill and curtail exports due to an ongoing dispute with
 Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ) over the supply of iron ore.  
 Kumba, a unit of Anglo American Plc, rose for a second day,
advancing 3.60 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 339.10 rand. Kumba
demanded that ArcelorMittal pay for ore before it’s delivered.  
 Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ), Africa’s second-largest gold
producer, dropped the most in six days, falling 1.48 rand, or
1.5 percent, to 99.52 rand.   Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. 
(HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest producer of the metal, lost
1.52 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 79.38 rand. Gold for immediate
delivery declined as much as 1.8 percent to $1,186.25 an ounce.  
 Hulamin Ltd.  (HLM SJ), an aluminum processor, fell for a
second day, declining 25 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 10.40 rand.
Hulamin said operating profit for the six months through June is
expected to be between 97 million rand ($12.8 million) and 105
million rand, compared with 114 million rand posted for the same
period a year earlier.  
 MTN Group Ltd.  (MTN SJ), Africa’s largest mobile-phone
company, increased for a second day, rising 3.91 rand, or 3.5
percent, to 116.96 rand, after saying yesterday it will focus on
investor payouts rather than big acquisitions.
