             Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s
largest carrier, said it anticipates getting about 65,000
applications for its 1,000 airport job openings as millions of
Americans continue to look for work.  
 The airline is hiring workers at its 25 biggest U.S.
airports to help with planes that are flying with near-record
percentages of seats filled and cope with weather disruptions,
Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said today in a weekly
recorded message to employees.  
 The company often gets “many multiples” of applications
when it has job openings, he said. Delta has about 81,000
employees and previously said it plans to hire about 240 pilots.  
 Delta is expanding its workforce as travel demand and fares
increase, helping repair balance sheets and return the industry
to profitability. The Atlanta-based carrier may report second-
quarter  net income of $510 million  on July 19, based on the
average of 5 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 U.S. airlines employed 18,756 fewer workers in May than a
year earlier, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation
Statistics. The industry’s total workforce was 557,400 people
for the month, the agency reported.  
 The June unemployment rate was 9.5 percent for the U.S. and
10 percent for  Georgia , according to government data.
