-- Cost of Living, Consumer Confidence in U.S. Probably Dropped

             The  cost  of living in the U.S.
dropped in June for a third straight month, showing inflation is
contained as the recovery cools, economists said ahead of
reports today.  
 The consumer price index declined 0.1 percent last month
after a 0.2 percent drop in May, according to the median
forecast of 75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Another
report will show consumer sentiment dropped in early July,
economists said.  
 Businesses are offering discounts to maintain sales as
customers face foreclosures and a labor market that has been
slow to improve. The lack of inflation gives Federal Reserve
policy makers scope to leave the benchmark interest rate near
zero in coming months to help invigorate the economy.  
 “Very few companies have any pricing power,” said  Brian Bethune , chief U.S. financial economist at IHS Global Insight in
Lexington, Massachusetts. “Because of the fact that there’s
been no price pressure, there’s no pressure on the Fed to do
anything.”  
 The Labor Department’s consumer-price report is due at 8:30
a.m. in Washington. Survey forecasts ranged from a decline of
0.4 percent to a gain of 0.1 percent.  
 At 9:55 a.m., a report from Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan will show its preliminary consumer sentiment  index  for
July fell to 74 from 76 in June, according to the survey.  
 Less Inflation  
 The CPI report will show that in the 12 months to June,
prices increased 1.2 percent, down from a 2 percent year-over-
year gain the prior month, according to the survey median. The
projected increase over the past 12 months would be the smallest
since October.  
 Excluding food and energy, the so-called  core  index rose
0.1 percent, the survey showed, matching the previous month’s
gain. The measure would be up 0.9 percent since June 2009,
matching the year-over-year increases in April and May as the
smallest since 1966.  
 Overall consumer prices last month were probably restrained
by a drop in food and fuel costs. The price of a gallon of
regular gasoline at the pump averaged $2.73 in June, down from
$2.84 the prior month, according to  data  from AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring group.  
 Rents, which account for about 40 percent of core consumer
prices, have been restrained as the foreclosures push more
houses into the rental market. Still, apartment vacancies in the
U.S. dropped in the second quarter from the previous three
months, the first quarterly improvement in two years, according
to Reis Inc., a real estate research firm. The improvement
signals rents may soon stabilize.  
 Vacancies Drop  
 The vacancy rate for apartment properties was 7.8 percent,
down from a 30-year high of 8 percent in the first quarter and
up from 7.7 percent a year earlier, according to a July 8 report
from Reis. First-quarter vacancies were the highest since 1980,
when the company began tracking the data.  
 Fed policy makers in their June 22-23 meeting trimmed their
outlook for inflation this year to a range of 1.0 percent to 1.1
percent from 1.2 percent to 1.5 percent in April.  
 Central bankers said their longer-run inflation goal is 1.7
percent to 2 percent, measured by the personal consumption
expenditures price index.  
 The European debt crisis has weighed on the value of the
euro and may keep damping U.S. inflation in coming months. At
the same time, American exports to Europe may slow as a stronger
dollar holds down the cost of imported goods.  
 Falling Yields  
 Concern over the outlook for growth and little inflation
has spurred a rally in U.S. Treasury securities that is pushing
down borrowing costs. The yield on the  two-year note  reached
0.5767 percent yesterday, the lowest since regular sales began
in 1975. Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index data show
Treasuries gained 1.3 percent in the past month, versus a 1.7
percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 The CPI is the broadest of three monthly price gauges from
Labor, because it includes goods and services. Almost 60 percent
of the CPI covers prices consumers pay for services ranging from
medical visits to airline fares and movie tickets.  
 Some companies are reducing prices to spur sales.
 Amazon.com Inc. , the world’s largest online retailer, last month
cut the cost for its Kindle electronic reader 27 percent to
$189, accelerating a price war with  Barnes & Noble Inc. , the
bookstore chain that earlier announced a discount on its own e-
book device, the Nook.  
 Retailers are also taking steps to lure in shoppers.
 Staples Inc. , the largest U.S. office-supply retailer, has
increased inventory and is offering more discounts while
spending more on advertising, said  Demos Parneros , president of
U.S. retail at the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company.  
 “We are being very aggressive with good offers,” Parneros
said. “It worked last year and customers responded. We need to
generate more traffic into the stores.”
