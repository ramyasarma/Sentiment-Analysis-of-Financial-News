             Green Bay Packers defensive tackle
 Johnny Jolly  was suspended indefinitely for violating the
National Football League’s substance-abuse policy.  
 The suspension begins immediately and will last at least
through the 2010 NFL season, the league said in an e-mailed
statement. He’ll be eligible for reinstatement following the
Super Bowl.  
 Jolly is facing drug charges following a July 2008 arrest
outside a Houston club in which he was found illegally
possessing at least 200 grams of codeine, according to the
Associated Press. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in
prison, AP said.  
 “Johnny is a good player that loves everything about the
game of football,” the Packers said in a statement on their
 website . “We appreciate the contributions he has made to the
Packers the past four seasons. His focus and priorities now lie
elsewhere -- our thoughts are with him during this difficult
personal time.”  
 Jolly, 27, was drafted in the sixth round in 2006 out of
Texas A&M University. He’s had two sacks and 78 tackles during
his career, playing in every game the past two seasons for Green
Bay.
