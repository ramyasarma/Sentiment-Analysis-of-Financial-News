             Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest
independent brokerage by client assets, reported second-quarter
profit that beat the average analyst estimate as revenue from
earned interest offset a drop in trading. The shares climbed.  
 Net income was $205 million, or 17 cents a  share , compared
with $205 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, the San
Francisco-based company said in a statement today. Analysts
 estimated  profit of 15 cents, according to the average in a
Bloomberg survey. The stock rose the most in more than two
months.  
 “Higher asset management fees and higher net interest
drove most of the upside,”  Alex Kramm , a New York-based analyst
at UBS AG, wrote in a note after the release. “Results
reiterate that Schwab has turned the corner after a challenging
2009” and first quarter.  
 The brokerage has been weathering a near-zero interest rate
environment since December 2008. About one third of last year’s
 revenue  came from interest earned on cash in its bank and money
market funds, while almost half was from fees for managing and
administering assets. Last quarter’s results benefited from a
stabilizing short-term rates and an improving economy, Chairman
Charles Schwab said in the release.  
 Revenue from interest earned on cash and investments
climbed 26 percent to $382 million, the company said today,
offsetting a 14 percent drop in sales from trading. Total
revenue slipped 0.5 percent to $1.08 billion. Net new customer
assets declined $37.5 billion. Clients placed a daily average of
302,900 trades that generated revenue for Schwab.  
 ‘Well Positioned’  
 “Even if interest rates and equity market valuations just
hold their ground in coming months, we are well positioned to
turn our expanding client base into higher revenues and
earnings,” Chief Financial Officer  Joe Martinetto  said in
today’s release.  
 The  shares  rose 4.1 percent, the most since May 10, to
$15.14 at 4 p.m. New York time. They have fallen 20 percent in
2010, compared with a 4.5 percent drop in the S&P 500 and a 12
percent loss for the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index.  
 E*Trade Financial Corp. and  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  are
scheduled to report results next week. Analysts expect E*Trade
to post a loss of 11 cents a share, while TD Ameritrade may
report a profit of 28 cents, according to the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
