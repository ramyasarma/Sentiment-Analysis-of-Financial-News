             Londoners pay an average premium of
20,300 pounds ($31,000) for a home within easy reach of a subway
or railway station,  Nationwide Building Society  said.  
 Properties located within 500 meters (547 yards) of a stop
will cost on average 7.2 percent more than an identical home
1,500 meters away, Britain’s biggest customer-owned lender said
in an e-mailed report today.  
 Homes nearest a station on the Circle Line of London’s
subway network, also known as the tube, have the highest average
price at almost 500,000 pounds. Those nearest the Central Line,
which serves some of East London’s least expensive areas, have
the lowest at 275,000 pounds, Nationwide said.  
 “One might expect those buying property in the capital
would prefer to live close to a tube or train station and be
willing to pay a premium for this,” Nationwide’s Chief
Economist  Martin Gahbauer  said in the report. “Whilst
homebuyers would prefer to live close to a station, it becomes
less important once outside easy walking distance.”  
 The premium to live near a station falls the further away a
property is, with those located 750 meters commanding a 5.2
percent premium and those 1,000 meters away a 3.4 percent
premium, Nationwide said. Nationwide used data from its  mortgage
lending  in Greater London in 2009 to calculate the results.  
 Luxury-home prices in central London are increasing in
value at twice the U.K. average as a decline in the pound leads
overseas buyers to shrug off higher taxes and seek bargains in
the most expensive areas,  Knight Frank LLP  said on July 2.
