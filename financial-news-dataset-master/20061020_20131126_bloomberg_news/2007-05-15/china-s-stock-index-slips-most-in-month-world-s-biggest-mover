             China 's stocks fell the most in a
month as investors judged gains this year to be excessive
relative to earnings growth potential. China  Minsheng Banking (600016) 
Corp. and China  Merchants Bank  Co. led declines.  
 Consumer stocks including Inner Mongolia  Yili Industrial (600887) 
Group Co. climbed after a government report showed the nation's
retail sales increased last month.  Bank of Communications Ltd. ,
China's sixth largest, surged 71 percent on its debut in
 Shanghai .  
 ``Some investors have stepped up selling to lock in profit,
expecting there's going to be a major correction ,'' said Fan Dizhao, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.8 billion at Guotai
Asset Management Co. in Shanghai. ``April's retail sales figure
is pretty good and supports the long-term stable trend of
spending'' and will boost consumer-related stocks, Fan said.  
 Shanghai's foreign-currency shares fell for the first time
in 10 days, ending the longest winning streak in four months.  
 The benchmark  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , which tracks yuan-denominated A
shares listed on China's two exchanges, fell 129.78, or 3.5
percent, to close at 3604.64, the largest decline since April 19.
It was the biggest fluctuation among equity markets included in
global benchmarks. The measure had gained 83 percent this year
before today.  
 Credit Suisse Group expects mainland policy makers to take
steps to cool the local stock market. These may include raising
 interest rates , taxing share transactions, selling state-owned
shares or the use of ``harsh comments'' by senior officials.  
 ``We expect to see an approximate 30 percent correction of
share prices,'' Credit Suisse economist Dong Tao said in a
research note published today.  
 Lenders Fall  
 Banks led the declines. Minsheng Banking, the nation's first
privately controlled lender, fell 0.91  yuan , or 6.3 percent, to
13.53. The stock had risen 42 percent this year to yesterday
China Merchants Bank, China's seventh-largest, lost 1.36 yuan, or
6.1 percent, to 20.80. Its shares had gained 35 percent this
year. Today's declines were their biggest since Feb. 27.  
 Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, the Chinese partner of
Citigroup Inc., fell 2.19 yuan, or 7.5 percent, to 27.07 yuan.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the nation's largest, slid
0.24 yuan, or 4.2 percent, to 5.51.  
 In other industries, China Vanke Co., the biggest property
developer, lost 1.09 yuan, or 4.5 percent, to 22.97, after
gaining 10 percent yesterday, the daily cap. Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co., China's biggest steelmaker, fell 0.65 yuan, or 4.9 percent,
to 12.63. Baoshan climbed 19 percent in the previous five days.  
 Equities also fell after China's securities regulator
ordered the country's fund management companies to not get
involved in speculative buying of shares, state-run  Securities
Times  reported, citing a circular from an unspecified regulator.  
 Fund managers must be wary of ``liquidity risks'' and are
barred from owning more stocks than they're capitalized for, the
Shenzhen-based newspaper said.  
 Retail sales  
 Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial, China's biggest dairy
producer by sales, gained 1.00 yuan, or 3.3 percent, to 31.10.
Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric Co., an electrical equipment
manufacturer and distributor, jumped 5.9 yuan, or 10 percent, to
64.76 yuan.  
 Retail sales climbed 15.5 percent to 667.3 billion yuan
($86.8 billion) last month after gaining 15.3 percent in March,
the National Bureau of Statistics said today. That was the
biggest increase since May 2004 when the first two months of each
year are combined to eliminate Lunar New Year holiday
distortions.  
 Shanghai Yuyuan Tourist Mart Co. (600655) , a retailer of gold and
jewelry, jumped 2.32 yuan, or 6.8 percent, to 36.41. Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co. has a target price of 60 yuan for the
company, citing a strengthening yuan and earnings growth from new
projects, the brokerage said in a report today.  
 Soars On Debut  
 Bank of Communications rose 5.64 yuan, or 71 percent, to
13.54 on its first day of trading in Shanghai. It gained as much
as 90 percent from its offer price of 7.90 yuan.  
 Bocom's $3.3 billion sale drew a record $188 billion of
orders. Its closing price catapulting the market value of the
company to $65.3 billion.  
 Shanghai's index of foreign-currency  B shares  fell 1.9
percent to 310.68, after gaining for the nine previous days. The
gauge for Shenzhen B shares retreated 3.3 percent to 739.68.  
 China's B shares have gained since March amid speculation
that the stocks will be merged with the more expensive, yuan-
denominated A shares. The B shares, which can be bought and sold
only by domestic individuals and overseas investors, are traded
in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen.
