             Qatar Telecom QSC, the Persian Gulf
emirate's monopoly phone company, said full-year profit jumped
43 percent led by growth in its Omani mobile-phone unit.  
 Net income rose to 1.7 billion Qatari riyals ($467
million) from 1.19 billion riyals a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the Doha Securities Market today.
Revenue increased 48 percent to 4.42 billion riyals. The
company did not provide earnings per share or fourth-quarter
results.  
 Qatar Telecom's combined mobile-phone customer base in
Qatar and Oman grew 55 percent in the past 12 month. Nawras
Telecom in Oman, which accounts for more than a third of all
its subscribers, generated revenue of 470 million riyals and
captured 31 percent of the Omani market, the operator said in
the statement. Qatar Telecom is the biggest shareholder of
Nawras, which started operations in March 2005 as the
sultanate's second mobile operator.  
 Arab phone companies like Emirates Telecommunications
Corp. in the United Arab Emirates, are expanding abroad to
boost sales as domestic markets mature. Nine in 10 people
living in Qatar subscribed to mobile phone services by the end
of 2005, Bloomberg data shows. Qatar Telecom in January agreed
to buy 25 percent of a unit of Singapore Technologies Telemedia
Pte. as part of a plan to expand into Asia.  
 The company's board of director proposed increasing this
year's dividend to 10 riyals, from 8.50 riyals last year. The
payout is subject to shareholder approval.  
 Qatar Telecom, known as Q-Tel, is set to lose the domestic
communications monopoly it has had since 1998, under a law
signed by Qatar's ruler, Emir Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, the Doha-based Peninsula newspaper reported in November.  
 Q-Tel's shares declined 5.1 percent last year, while
Doha's benchmark dropped 35 percent. Today the shares lost 1.6
percent closing at 246.9 riyals in Doha.
