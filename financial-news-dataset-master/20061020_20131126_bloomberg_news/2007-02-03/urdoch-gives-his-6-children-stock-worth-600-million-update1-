             Billionaire  Rupert Murdoch 's trust
gave each of his six children shares of  News Corp. (NWSA)  valued at
about $100 million, seven months after settling a family dispute
over how to share control of his stake in the media company.  
 The children were awarded about 4.4 million shares valued
at $103 million at today's closing price of $23.32. They include
Lachlan, a former chief operating officer of New York-based  News
Corp. (NWS)  who still sits on the board, and James, who runs News
Corp.'s U.K. satellite business.  
 Murdoch, 75, said in July disputes over how to share
control of his stake in News Corp. were resolved ``happily,''
without getting into details. Murdoch has four adult children
and two young daughters with Wendi Deng, a former executive from
his Asia Star TV who he married in 1999.  
 ``They are all treated equally,'' Murdoch said in a July 21
interview with  Charlie Rose .  
 Murdoch has four adult children from his two previous
marriages: Prudence with his first wife Patricia, and Lachlan,
35, James, 34, and Elisabeth with Anna, his second wife.  
 Class A  shares  of News Corp., owner of Fox News and the
Twentieth Century Fox film studios, have gained 49 percent in
the past year.
