India’s stock declined, with the
benchmark index retreating from its highest level in 2 1/2 years
as some investors judged recent gains may be overdone.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company,
dropped for the first day in five. Foreign fund inflows to
India’s equities have increased 60 percent this year, making the
benchmark index the most expensive in Asia and among the BRIC
markets that also comprise Brazil, Russia and China. The 14-day
 relative strength index  of the main stock gauge climbed to 82.9
yesterday, the highest since October 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Some investors regard readings above 70
as a signal to sell. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the largest
software services exporter, fell.  “The rally has been too fast too soon,” said Ambareesh
Baliga, vice president of equities at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
in Mumbai. “We are not investing because fundamentally we are
finding the markets extremely expensive.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 59.83, or 0.3 percent, to 19,941.72. The gauge has gained
24 percent from its May 25 low. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange dropped 0.3 percent to 5,991.00. The  BSE
200 Index  retreated 0.3 percent to 2,520.56.  Larsen, Tata Consultancy  Larsen & Toubro decreased 2.4 percent to 1,991.65 rupees,
retreating from its highest level since January 2008. The
stock’s relative strength index has been over 70 for the past
three days.  Tata Consultancy declined from a record, losing 2 percent
to 935.25 rupees.  DLF Ltd. , the biggest developer, retreated 1.4
percent to 353.7 rupees. Both companies’ relative strength
indexes exceeded 70 within the past week.  The rally in the Sensex past the 20,000 level has been
driven “solely” by overseas funds, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  “Domestic investors do not seem to share the optimism of
foreign investors and the media,” the analysts said.  The advance in the Sensex from the 17,000 level to
20,001.55 yesterday was propelled by net inflows of about $11.2
billion from foreign institutional investors, according to
Credit Suisse analysts led by  Ashish Gupta . In contrast, mutual
funds have been net sellers of about $2.5 billion while other
domestic institutions including insurance companies have sold
about $1.8 billion, the analysts said in a report.  Fund Flows  Overseas  funds  bought a net  33.1 billion rupees  ($724.4
million) of Indian equities on Sept. 22, the most in seven weeks,
according to the market regulator.  Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
