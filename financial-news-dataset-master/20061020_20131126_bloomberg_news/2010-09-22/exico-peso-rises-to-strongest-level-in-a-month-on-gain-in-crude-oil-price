Mexico’s peso rose to the strongest
level in a month as crude oil, the nation’s second-largest
export, jumped.  The peso increased 0.7 percent to 12.6287 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.7183 yesterday. It touched 12.6262,
the strongest level since Aug. 19. The currency has gained 3.6
percent this year against the dollar.  Oil rose as much as 3.4 percent to $76 a barrel. Crude is
the nation’s second-largest export after automobiles and auto
parts. The Federal Reserve said yesterday that it’s ready to
“provide additional accommodation” to bolster the U.S.
economy, the biggest buyer of Mexican exports.  “Oil is rising, and that’s something that benefits the
peso,” said  Bertrand Delgado , an economist at Roubini Global
Economics LLC in New York. “The Fed’s move yesterday is
weakening the dollar, and that is obviously being reflected in
the peso.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 11
basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.539 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
1.2 centavos to 131.96 centavos per peso.  Traders triggered $283 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $344
million of options have been exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in options
monthly, allowing it to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign
reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
