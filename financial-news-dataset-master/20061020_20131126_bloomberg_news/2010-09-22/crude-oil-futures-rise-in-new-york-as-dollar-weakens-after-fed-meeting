Oil rose in New York before a
report forecast to show U.S. crude supplies dropped last week.  Oil recovered some of yesterday’s 1.8 percent loss as the
dollar fell to a five-month low, spurring demand for
commodities. The Energy Department may say today U.S. crude
supplies shrank 1.75 million barrels from 357.4 million last
week, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The consensus expects some crude inventory declines, and
if that turns out to be correct that should help prices,” said
 Hannes Loacker , an analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich
AG in Vienna. “Apart from that, there’s a bit of support from
the weakness in the dollar.”  The November contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange
rose as much as 71 cents, or 1 percent, to $75.68 a barrel, and
traded for $75.48 at 1:34 p.m. London time. Yesterday it lost
$1.22. Brent crude for November fell 6 cents to $78.36 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  November Brent’s premium to the New York contract was at
$2.88 a barrel today after reaching $3.45 yesterday.  Nymex crude for October delivery slipped $1.34, or 1.8
percent, to $73.52 a barrel yesterday, the lowest closing price
since Aug. 31. The contract expired at the end of floor trading.  API Report  Futures fell yesterday after the industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute said crude inventories grew by 2.23 million
barrels to 364.1 million, the highest  level  for this time of
year in five years. Refineries probably ran at 86.8 percent of
capacity last week, according to Bloomberg’s survey of analysts.  Supplies  of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point
for New York futures fell by 219,000 barrels to 34.8 million,
the API data showed. Inventories in the U.S. Midwest and the
Gulf Coast, home to a majority of the country’s refining
capacity fell.  “Huge discrepancies often exist between the API and
Department of Energy report, and we have the feeling this is
going to be one of those weeks.”  Stephen Schork , president of
the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a
report today.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 75 percent of the time in the past four years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium between the November New York oil future and
December contract narrowed to $1.47 a barrel today. It was as
wide as $1.75 on Sept. 17. The dollar traded at $1.3366 per euro
as of 1:34 p.m. London time after sinking as low as $1.3396, the
weakest level since April 27.  “Fundamentals are not strong enough to go above 80 without
support from general decrease in risk aversion, and therefore
rising stock markets,” said Raiffeisen’s Loacker.  U.S. gasoline  demand rebounded  from a 23-month low last
week, MasterCard Inc. reported yesterday. Motorists bought an
average 9.01 million barrels a day of the motor fuel, up 1.9
percent from the prior week, according to the weekly
SpendingPulse report. It was the first increase in five weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
