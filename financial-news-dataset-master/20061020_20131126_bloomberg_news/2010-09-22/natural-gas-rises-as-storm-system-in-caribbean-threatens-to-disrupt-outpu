Natural gas futures rose for a
second day as forecasts showed that a strengthening storm over
the south-central Caribbean Sea may move to gas production
regions in the Gulf of Mexico.  The weather system has a 60 percent chance of becoming a
tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours,  the National Hurricane
Center  said in an advisory at 2 p.m. Miami time. The eastern
Gulf or Florida is the “favored future path” of the system,
according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in
Rockville, Maryland.  “The storm is offering some support to the market,” said
 Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky. “People are keeping their
eyes on it and something like that will force some sellers to
the sideline.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 4.7 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $3.966 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have gained 9.9
percent from a year ago.  The Energy Department may say tomorrow that U.S. gas
stockpiles increased by 79 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 17, according to the median of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain is 70 billion.  U.S. gas stockpiles jumped 103 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 10 to 3.267 trillion, the Energy Department
reported last week. The increase, the biggest for that time of
the year since 2006, exceeded the five-year average gain for the
first time since April.  Westward Movement  The weather system in the Caribbean is moving westward at
15 miles (24 kilometers) per hour, according to the hurricane
center.  “The majority of model guidance continues to favor a track
into the eastern Gulf or Florida,” said  Matt Rogers , a
forecaster with Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland. Still, there are chances that the storms may “move to
Mexico or Central America areas.”  In the eastern Atlantic, Tropical Storm Lisa retained
strength with sustained winds of 45 mph, the hurricane center
said. The storm was 435 miles (705 kilometers) west of the Cape
Verde Islands.  This hurricane season so far has had less of an impact on
Gulf gas production than had been projected by the government.
All five major Atlantic hurricanes stayed away from the main
Gulf gas production facilities.  Hotter Weather  Hotter-than-normal weather may increase demand for gas from
power plants to run air conditioners. New York will have a high
of 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius) on Aug. 24, 16 degrees
above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,
Pennsylvania.  About 23 percent of U.S. electricity is generated using
natural gas, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 6.61 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $4.019 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
180,558 as of 2:35 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
255,000. Volume was 307,435 yesterday. Open interest was 817,004
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 806,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
