Japan’s output of copper and
copper-alloy fabricated products, including sheets and tubes,
climbed 18.2 percent in August from a year earlier, increasing
for the 10th straight month, an industry group said.  Production was 65,820 metric tons last month compared with
55,670 tons a year ago, the Japan Copper and Brass  Association 
said today, citing preliminary data. July output was 75,860 tons.  Copper, used in pipes and wires, has risen about 24 percent
in the past year. Japan’s economy slowed less than initially
estimated in the second quarter as companies boosted capital
spending, indicating that the nation’s recovery was intact
before a surge in the yen threatened to stunt export gains.  “Gradually it’s been recovering to a level” seen before
the economic crisis in 2008, said Keizo Tani, the association’s
research section manager. “The industry has been bolstered by
exports to emerging markets rather than domestic consumption.”  The association increased its output estimate in the year
ending March 2011 to 865,400 tons from its March projection of
855,000 tons. Production totaled 753,848 tons in the year ended
March 31, the association said.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  grew an annualized 1.5
percent in the second quarter, faster than the 0.4 percent pace
reported in August, the Cabinet Office said on Sept. 10. The
economy expanded 5 percent in the first quarter.  Wire and Cable  The country’s copper wire and cable shipments gained 5.5
percent in August to 53,300 tons from a year earlier, advancing
for the eighth straight month, the  Japanese Electric Wire and
Cable Makers’ Association  said yesterday. Shipments totaled
59,579 tons in July, the data showed.  As a government-subsidy program -- which exempts purchases
of electric, hybrid, natural gas and some diesel vehicles from
taxes --  will end this month, the outlook for demand remains
uncertain, the wire and cable group said in a statement.  The association’s shipment estimate for the year ending
March 2011 was raised to 666,000 tons from a March projection of
661,000 tons, compared with the previous year’s 662,500 tons,
the wire and cable group statement said. In the year ending
March 2015, the shipment forecast was boosted to 713,000 tons,
it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
