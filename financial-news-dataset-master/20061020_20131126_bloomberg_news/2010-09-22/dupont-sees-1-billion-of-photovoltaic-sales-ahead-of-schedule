DuPont Co. , the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, said sales from photovoltaic materials will top
$1 billion in 2010, one year ahead of its forecast.  Materials including encapsulates and metallization pastes
will help sales to the solar-power industry reach $2 billion by
2014,  Dave Miller , president of the electronics and
communications unit, said today on a webcast. Pretax operating
income in the unit will rise to 16 percent to 18 percent of
sales this year, from 6 percent last year, he said.  DuPont, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman , is
building factories and developing products to meet growing
demand for materials used to convert sunlight into electricity.
The U.S. will overtake Germany to become the top installer of
solar cells around 2014, about the same time photovoltaics will
become as efficient as conventional energy sources, negating the
need for government subsidies, he said.  “When this market reaches grid parity, who knows where
this thing goes,” Miller said. “We are well positioned for
growth in the PV market.”  DuPont, based in Wilmington, Delaware,  fell  21 cents to
$44.62 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 33 percent this year.  Dow Chemical Co. is the biggest U.S. chemical maker based
on 2009 sales, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
