Wheat rose for the first time in
three days as a slumping dollar improved demand prospects for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  The  greenback  fell as much as 1.1 percent to a six-month
low against a basket of currencies including the euro and yen.
 Egypt , the world’s largest wheat importer, bought 220,000 metric
tons of U.S. grain. Before today, futures jumped 50 percent in
three months as adverse weather hurt global crops.  “We’re up because the dollar is weaker,” said  Dewey Strickler , the president of Ag Watch Market Advisers in
Nashville, Tennessee. Egypt’s purchase “will help support
prices,” he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.2275 a bushel at 11:27 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, the price was up 4.7 percent this month
on speculation that reduced production in Russia and Ukraine
would boost exports from the U.S. and other suppliers.  Russia lowered its forecast for winter-grain planting by 18
percent to 15 million hectares (37 million acres) because the
soil is too dry for seeding in some areas, SovEcon said, citing
Agriculture Ministry data.  Ukraine has sown winter wheat on 2.42 million hectares this
year, down 5 percent from 2.55 million hectares at the same time
last year, the government said today. Farmers plan to seed 6.72
million hectares, down from 6.75 million in 2009, the ministry
said.  After the U.S., the biggest wheat exporters last year were
Canada, Russia and Australia, according to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
