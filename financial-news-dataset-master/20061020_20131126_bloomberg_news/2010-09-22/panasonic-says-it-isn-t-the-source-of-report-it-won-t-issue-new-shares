Panasonic Corp. isn’t the source of
the information in a report which said the company won’t issue
new shares to finance its acquisitions of two affiliated
companies. Panasonic is considering ways of raising funds for
the acquisitions, Akira Kadota, a Tokyo-based spokesman, said by
phone today.  The maker of Viera televisions plans to avoid issuing new
shares as part of its buyouts of Sanyo Electric Co. and
Panasonic Electric Works Co. and will use cash and loans to 
finance the purchases, Nikkei English News reported, without  saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
