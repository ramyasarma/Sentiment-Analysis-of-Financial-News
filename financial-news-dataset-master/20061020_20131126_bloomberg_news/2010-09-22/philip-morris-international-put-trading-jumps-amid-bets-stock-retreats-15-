Philip Morris International Inc.
put-option trades  jumped to a record  yesterday after investors
boosted bets that the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco
company will drop 15 percent by December.  More than 51,000 put options to sell the stock changed
hands yesterday, five times the number of calls to buy.  Almost
all  of the volume was caused by the purchase of December $52.50
puts and sale of December $47 puts, a spread strategy that pays
off most if the stock falls to the lower strike price. Today,
the shares lost 0.1 percent to $55.11 as of 4 p.m. in New York.
Philip Morris hasn’t closed below $47 since July 6.  “The trade is a bearish view on Philip Morris shares,”
said  Henry Schwartz , president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-
based provider of options-market analytics. “It’s actually a
low-cost bet with a large potential payoff.”  The bearish bets contrast with the 28 percent increase in
the New York-based company’s second-quarter profit after it
raised cigarette prices in countries such as Australia and
Mexico.  Tobacco companies  will be able to increase sales in
coming years as they still have pricing power, market research
company Euromonitor said Sept. 21, predicting 2 percent annual
growth in cigarette volume worldwide in the next five years.  Philip Morris reports third-quarter results on Oct. 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
