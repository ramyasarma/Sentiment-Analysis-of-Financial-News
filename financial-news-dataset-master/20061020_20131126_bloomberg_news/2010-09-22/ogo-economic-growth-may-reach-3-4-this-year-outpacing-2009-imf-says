(Corrects to deficit in last paragraph of story published
Sept. 22)  Togo’s economy may grow 3.4 percent
this year, faster than an earlier estimate, before expanding 3.7
percent in 2011, the International Monetary Fund said.  “Growth is rising, albeit modestly, in a context of
macroeconomic stability,” Marshall Mills, head of the
Washington-based fund’s mission to the West African nation, said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The IMF said July 16 Togo’s growth in 2010 would be around
3 percent, matching 2009.  The budget deficit is projected to “reach around 2.9
percent of gross domestic product, around the same level as
2009,” Mills said in the statement.  In 2011, the deficit may narrow to 2.8 percent, “bolstered
by significant revenue mobilization efforts,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
