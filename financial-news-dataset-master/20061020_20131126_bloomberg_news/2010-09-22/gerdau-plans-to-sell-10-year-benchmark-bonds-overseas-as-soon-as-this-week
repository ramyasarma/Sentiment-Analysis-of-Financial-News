Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, plans to sell 10-year bonds in a benchmark offering
as soon as tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The company, based in Porto Alegre, may sell the notes to
yield about 6 percent, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. HSBC Holdings Plc, Banco
Santander SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are underwriting the sale,
according to the person. A benchmark sale is typically at least
$500 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
