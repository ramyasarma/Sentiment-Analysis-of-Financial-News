     Sept. 22 (Bloomberg) --Investors should buy Japan’s 10-year
bonds if yields rise above the key level of 1.15 percent, Mizuho
Securities Co. said, citing trading patterns.  Benchmark  yields  declined from a high of 1.405 percent on
April 7 to a low of 0.895 percent on Aug. 25 during the fiscal
first half ending Sept. 30. During the period, yields closed
within a range of 1.10 percent to 1.15 percent on a compound
basis more than 16 percent of the trading days, said  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst at Japan’s second-largest banking
group. Trading was thin when yields were from 0.95 percent to
1.00 percent and from 1.15 percent to 1.20 percent, he said.  “The bond market will likely begin the second half with
range-bound trading -- sell at yields below 1 percent and buy at
yields above 1.15 percent,” Miura said.  Government attempts to revive economic growth are unlikely
to succeed in the coming fiscal second half, holding down
yields during the period, Miura said. The strong yen and the
expiration of subsidies for environmental-friendly cars will
likely slow growth in the fourth quarter, he said.  Yields may be bolstered by the government’s budget and
bond-sale plans for the fiscal year, Miura said. Demand for
bonds may be limited should Japan fail to meet its pledge to cap
annual spending at 71 trillion yen ($837 billion), he said.  “Any rise in long-term yields in the fiscal second half
will be temporary,” Miura said. “Investors should make sure to
buy on dips when yields rise above 1.15 percent.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond sank three basis
points to 1.015 percent as of 10 a.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
