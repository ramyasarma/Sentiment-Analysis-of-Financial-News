Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern
League party in the governing coalition, said he’s concerned
that UniCredit might fall into German control. Bossi, speaking
to reporters in Rome, said: “It was feared that Germany would
take over the bank but then we saw that they didn’t have the
numbers.” Banking foundations which are investors in UniCredit
must “organize the defense” of the bank from foreign control,
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
