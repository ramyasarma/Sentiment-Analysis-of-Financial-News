Nakheel PJSC restarted construction
work in its Al Furjan project with Al Shafar Transport and
Contracting Co., the Dubai World-owned property developer said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Nakheel had delayed payments to contractors and suppliers
causing Arabtec Holding Co. to stop work at the Al Furjan
project earlier this year after building only 550 villas. The
project was designed to include for 4,000 homes.  The company expects to restart all its “short term
projects” by October, according to the statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
