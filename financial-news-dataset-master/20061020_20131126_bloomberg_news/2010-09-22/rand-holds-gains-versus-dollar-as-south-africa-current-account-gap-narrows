South Africa’s rand held gains
against the dollar as the country’s current account deficit
narrowed to the lowest level in more than six years in the
second quarter.  The currency of Africa’s largest economy gained as much as
1.7 percent to 7.0171 per dollar and was trading at 7.0280 as of
9:04 a.m. in Johannesburg, from 7.1352 late yesterday.  The shortfall on the current account, the broadest measure
of trade in goods and services, eased to 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product from 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the
Reserve Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin released in Pretoria
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
