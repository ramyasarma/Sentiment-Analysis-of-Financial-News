The Federal Reserve’s statement
yesterday that inflation is below levels consistent with the
central bank’s mandate for price stability means it’s time to
buy gold, said  Allen Sinai , chief global economist at Decision
Economics Inc. in New York.  “That’s code for we don’t want to go the way of Japan so
we’re going to print money,” Sinai said in a radio interview
today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “You gotta
buy gold when those two central banks are doing what they’re
doing.”  Gold for December delivery was 1.6 percent higher at
$1,294.2 an ounce at 8:11 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching an all-time high $1,296.50. Bullion for immediate-
delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,292.60 an ounce in London, after
earlier today rising to a record $1,295.  The Fed’s Open Market Committee said yesterday it was
“prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed” to
support the recovery and boost inflation. Gold, which often
moves counter to the dollar, has advanced 17 percent this year
and is heading for its tenth consecutive annual gain.  Sinai said he forecasts a $1,500 price for gold.
“Inflation adjusted it’s still cheap as odd as it sounds,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
