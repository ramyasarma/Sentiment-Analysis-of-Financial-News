Soybeans rose for the third time in
four sessions on signs of strong demand for supplies from the
U.S., the biggest producer and exporter. Corn also gained.  U.S. shippers sold 226,000 metric tons of soybeans to
China, the Department of Agriculture said today, bringing this
week’s total to 621,000 tons. The dollar dropped to a six-month
low against a basket of six major currencies, increasing the
appeal of U.S. crops to overseas buyers.  “Demand continues strong,” said  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The
weakness in the dollar is keeping U.S. grain competitive.”  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 6.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $10.865 a bushel at 10:33 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The oilseed reached a 15-month high of $10.995
on Sept. 20.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $5.075 a bushel in Chicago. On Sept. 20, the price
reached $5.2375, the highest level for a most-active contract
since Sept. 30, 2008.  Speculative buying also increased today after the dollar
weakened and gold prices jumped to a record, boosting demand for
alternative assets as a hedge against inflation, Roose said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
