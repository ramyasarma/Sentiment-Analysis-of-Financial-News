Nigeria’s main rebel group in the
oil-rich Niger River delta region said it’s trying to gain
custody of three French nationals seized in the West African
nation’s coastal waters.  The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said
it’s working to transfer the three crew members employed by
 Bourbon SA , a French company that provides supply vessels for
the oil industry, from their kidnappers.  “We are in negotiations with the abductors towards
effecting a transfer of the men to the custody of MEND,” Jomo
Gbomo, a spokesman for the group, said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. “When this is done, we will be in a better position
to give further information about their state of health and
duration of their stay with us.”  Bourbon said three crew members were abducted during an
attack on its Bourbon Alexandre vessel by gunmen in several
speedboats on Sept. 21. The anchor-handling tug-supply vessel
was servicing installations of an offshore oil field of Addax
Petroleum Corp., according to Bourbon.  Attacks by armed groups in the southern delta, home to
Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, cut the country’s oil output by
more than 28 percent between 2006 and 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. The attacks decreased after thousands of
fighters accepted a government amnesty in 2009 and disarmed.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
