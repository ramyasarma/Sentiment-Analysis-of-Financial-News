The dollar slid to the lowest level
in six months versus a basket of currencies including the euro
and yen on speculation the Federal Reserve’s willingness to ease
monetary policy further will damp demand for U.S. assets.  The greenback weakened after U.S. policy makers said
yesterday that they “will provide additional accommodation if
needed” to spur growth. The euro rose for a third day versus
the dollar as Portugal sold 750 million euros ($1 billion) of
bonds and investors bought the maximum amounts at Spanish and
Irish debt sales yesterday.  “The likelihood of more Fed easing has clearly increased,
and that’s hurting the dollar,” said  Stephan Maier , a foreign-
exchange strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. “The market may
be getting ahead of itself, anticipating too much easing.”  The dollar slid 0.9 percent to $1.3382 per euro at 7:47
a.m. in New York, from $1.3264 yesterday, after reaching
$1.3396, the weakest level since April 27. The U.S. currency
dropped 0.6 percent to 84.62 yen, from 85.09. The euro climbed
0.3 percent to 113.24 yen, from 112.87.  Declines in the U.S. currency accelerated after
InterContinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index fell below 80 for
the first time since March 18, sparking some traders to unwind
bets on a gain, according to  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London.  Weaker Dollar  The gauge of the greenback against the currencies of six
major trading partners including the euro, yen, pound, Swiss
franc, Canadian dollar and Swedish krona fell 0.8 percent to
79.837 after touching 79.719, the lowest since March 17.  The dollar fell to 98.73 against the Swiss franc, the
lowest level since March 2008. The franc traded at 1.3243 versus
the euro.  The Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement after
its meeting yesterday in Washington that “inflation is likely
to remain subdued for some time before rising to levels the
committee considers consistent with its mandate.”  “The dollar weakness is due to concerns on the quality of
the Fed’s balance sheet,” said  David Deddouche , a foreign-
exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in Paris. The U.S.
currency may decline to $1.35 per euro within a week, according
to Deddouche.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2
percent. Gold for December delivery touched the all-time high of
$1,296.50 an ounce.  The euro rose for a third day against the dollar as
investors bid for 3.5 times the amount of securities maturing in
October 2014 offered by Portugal’s debt agency, compared with
3.1 times in July.  Portuguese Debt  Portugal also sold 300 million euros of bonds due in June
2020, leaving the total for the auction at the low end of the
range of 750 million euros to 1 billion euros set for the sale.  Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros of debt yesterday, the
 National Treasury Management Agency  said. Spain sold 7 billion
euros of 12- and 18-month bills, the maximum target, the Bank of
Spain said.  The auction results “suggest that concerns are abating,”
 Steven Englander , New York-based head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note yesterday.  The  difference  in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 9,644 on Sept. 14
compared with net shorts of 23,699 a week earlier, data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Sept. 17.  Yen Demand  Demand for the yen may have been tempered by speculation
Japan will sell its currency again after intervening in the
foreign-exchange market on Sept. 15 for the first time in more
than six years. The yen has risen about 1 percent since the
intervention pushed the currency down to a one-month low from a
15-year high.  The central bank is monitoring the yen’s strength, which is
an impediment to the nation’s economic recovery, a Bank of Japan
board member,  Ryuzo Miyao , said today. He also said the bank
plans to take appropriate credit-easing steps if needed.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said Japan should put in place
economic and monetary policies to weaken the yen, the Financial
Times reported today, citing an interview.  “This is the pivotal area for dollar-yen,” said  Matthew Brady , executive director for foreign exchange at JPMorgan Chase
& Co. in Sydney. “This is the area where there was intervention
last week and the market will maybe put a line through the sand
around 84.80 yen.”  The New Zealand dollar rose before a report tomorrow that
economists said will show the nation’s economic growth
accelerated. The kiwi gained 0.5 percent to 73.84 U.S. cents.  Norway’s krone slipped 0.3 percent to 7.9285 per euro
before the nation’s central bank decides on borrowing costs.
Norges Bank will keep its target rate at 2 percent at 2 p.m. in
Oslo, according to all 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
