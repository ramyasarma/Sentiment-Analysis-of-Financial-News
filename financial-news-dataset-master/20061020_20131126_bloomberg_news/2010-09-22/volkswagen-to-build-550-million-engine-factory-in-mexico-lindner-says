Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest
carmaker, will build a $550 million engine plant in Mexico as
the automaker expands in North America, said  Otto Lindner ,
president of the company’s operations in the country.  The plant in Silao will produce 330,000 engines a year for
cars built in Puebla, Mexico, and Chattanooga, Tennessee,
Lindner told reporters at an event in Mexico City. Construction
will begin next month, and the factory will begin operations in
2013.  The plant will be Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen’s
first in Mexico outside of its Puebla complex, where the company
has operated for 40 years and assembles the Jetta, Golf and New
Beetle models.  “Now we are making the decision to establish a second
productive unit in Mexico, a necessary step to continue with our
growth strategy in the  region ,” Lindner said in a Spanish-
language statement.  Volkswagen said in a statement it plans to sell 1 million
automobiles annually in the U.S. by 2018. The company has said
it’s seeking to overtake Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s
largest automaker.  The company said it chose Silao, where  General Motors Co. 
assembles vehicles, because the area has a base of suppliers and
workforce experienced in the auto industry. Volkswagen will
create 700 jobs at the site, Lindner said.  Volkswagen chose to build the plant in Mexico because it
had lower costs than the U.S. and Canadian options the company
considered, Lindner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
