CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. raised
its Malaysian  stock index  target by 5.9 percent, citing
government efforts to boost investment and economic growth.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  may rise to a record
1,610 by the end of 2011,  Terence Wong , an analyst at CIMB
Investment, said in a report today, increasing the previous
estimate of 1,520. The end-2010 target was increased to 1,500
from 1,450. The gauge rose 0.1 percent to 1,477.45 as of 11:19
a.m. local time.  Malaysia’s government yesterday said it plans to develop a
nuclear energy industry, build a mass rail network and create a
shopping district to rival Singapore’s Orchard Road. The plans
are part of the $444 billion worth of potential projects it has
identified to accelerate growth and draw investors.  “The economic transformation program held positive
surprises, we see potential re-rating catalysts in the form of
positive newsflow,” Wong said in the report. “We see positive
implications for the construction and property industries.”  The  Malaysian index  has surged 18 percent since the May 26
low, surpassing levels before the start of the global financial
crisis in 2008. The index on Sept. 13 exceeded Wong’s previous
year-end target of 1,450.  ‘Big’ Winners  Construction and property stocks are the “big” winners
from the government’s economic transformation program, he said.
Builders  Gamuda Bhd.  and MMC Corp. stand to gain should the
government approve a mass rail project for Kuala Lumpur, he said.
The Cabinet will consider a study on the 45 billion ringgit ($15
billion) project by the end of this year, according to an
exhibition in the capital that began yesterday.  Shares of Gamuda climbed 4.5 percent to 3.92 ringgit at
11:58 a.m. local time in Kuala Lumpur, set for their highest
close since February 2008. MMC gained 4 percent to 2.89 ringgit,
headed for its highest close since July 2008.  YTL Corp.  and property developer UEM Land Holdings Bhd.
will also benefit from the government’s plans, while Genting
Bhd., owner of a hilltop casino, also stands to gain as the
projects including a proposed high-speed rail system linking
Singapore will draw more tourists, he said.  YTL gained 5.3 percent to 7.99, set for the highest close
since December 2007. The stock is the best performer on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index today.  The government is studying the viability of a high-speed
rail system to connect greater Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with a
traveling time of two hours, according to the exhibition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
