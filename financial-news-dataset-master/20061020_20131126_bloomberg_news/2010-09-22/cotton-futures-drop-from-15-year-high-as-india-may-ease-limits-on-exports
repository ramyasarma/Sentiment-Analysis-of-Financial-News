Cotton fell from a 15-year high on
speculation that India, the world’s second-biggest grower, may
ease limits on exports.  India may boost output by 17 percent to a record 34.5
million bales in the next season, said Nayan Mirani, the vice
president of Cotton Association of India, a trade group that
represents 450 growers, ginners and traders. The government may
lift export limits as soon as November, he said yesterday.
Before today, cotton prices jumped 61 percent in the past year.  “There’s a good chance that India is going to relax their
export requirements,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader
in Mandeville, Louisiana. “I’m expecting today’s high to be a
near-term top.”  Cotton for December delivery declined 1.17 cents, or 1.2
percent to settle at 99.62 cents a pound at 3:08 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, after touching $1.0334, the highest
price for a most-active contract since June 19, 1995.  “There is a possibility the government will increase the
export limit at the next review meeting in November,” Mirani
said in an interview yesterday in Lubbock, Texas.  India said it would limit exports to 5.5 million bales in
the year beginning Oct. 1 in a bid to meet domestic demand. A
“prohibitive” duty will be imposed on shipments above that
level, Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said on Sept. 4. A
review meeting on exports will be held Nov. 15, he said.  Global cotton use will rise to 120.5 million bales in the
year that began Aug. 1, the USDA estimates, outpacing production
of 117 million bales. Inventories in  warehouses  monitored by ICE
were down 96 percent this year as of yesterday. A bale weighs
about 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  The cotton crop in the U.S., the biggest exporter, was
rated 58 percent in good or excellent condition as of Sept. 19,
down from 59 percent a week earlier, the USDA said on Sept. 20.
The country’s harvest was 13 percent completed, compared a five-
year average of 10 percent, according to the department.  “Overall the U.S. crop is looking very good,” said  Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers &
Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. “Early yields are very
promising” in the Mississippi Delta and south Texas, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
