Cotton gained for a fifth day in
New York, nearing a 15-year high as increasing Chinese demand
for imports depletes world stocks of the fiber used to make
products from textiles to book bindings.  Cotton for December delivery rose as much as 1.5 percent to
$1.0227 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. after yesterday touching
$1.0237, the highest price since June 1995. The contract traded
at $1.019 at 2:56 p.m. Paris time.  Imports of the fiber into China doubled in 2010’s first
eight months from a year earlier, according to Customs General
Administration figures published yesterday. The global stocks-
to-use ratio for cotton is forecast to fall to 38 percent in the
year ending in July, the lowest level since 1994-95, according
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  “Rising demand coming from China and other user countries
is driving market participants to pay high prices,” Jonathan
Bouchet, an analyst at OTCex in Geneva, said in a research note
today. “As supply remains extremely tight, users are ready to
pay extra premiums.”  Global cotton use will rise to 120.5 million bales in the
year that started Aug. 1, the USDA estimates, outpacing
production of 117 million bales and becoming the sixth year that
usage exceeds the world crop.  Global cotton inventories will slump 3.3 percent to 45.4
million bales at the end of the marketing year on July 31, the
USDA forecasts. A bale weighs about 480 pounds.  Stockpiles Drop  The most-active New York cotton future has increased 35
percent this year. Inventories in  warehouses  monitored by ICE
were down 96 percent this year as of Sept. 20.  “The increase has been a bit exhaustive, but as there is
no supply around, people are ready to pay for it,” Bouchet
said. “There is still room for more upside.”  The cotton crop in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter,
was rated 58 percent in good or excellent condition as of Sept.
19, down from 59 percent a week earlier, the USDA said on Sept.
20. The country’s harvest was 13 percent completed as of Sept.
19, compared with 8 percent a week earlier and a five-year
average of 10 percent, according to the department.  Rain in China’s growing regions may cause rotting in some
unharvested cotton, World Weather Inc. President  Drew Lerner 
said on Sept. 15. China is forecast by the USDA to import 12.8
million bales this year, compared with 10.9 million bales last
year and 7 million bales in 2008-09.  Pakistan, the world’s third-largest cotton user, may raise
imports as much 50 percent this year as the nation’s worst-ever
floods destroy crops and textile demand increases. Imports may
reach 3 million bales, compared with about 2 million last year,
Muhammad Arshad, a vice president at the Pakistan Central Cotton
Committee, said yesterday.  U.S. cotton exports to Brazil will rise to 1.1 million
bales this year, more than triple the record 335,000 bales in
1994, the USDA’s  Foreign Agriculture Service  said Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
