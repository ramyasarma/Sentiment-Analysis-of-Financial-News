ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest
steelmaker, appointed  Bernard Fontana  as chief executive officer
of its stainless division, which is being assessed for a
potential spinoff.  Fontana, previously head of human resources for the group,
replaces  Jean-Yves Gilet , who has left the company to head
France’s Strategic Investment Fund, ArcelorMittal said in a
statement today.  Willie Smit , previously vice president of
employee relations and benchmarking, will replace Fontana.  The Luxembourg-based company said in July it would study a
spinoff of its stainless steel unit to current shareholders to
allow the business to pursue growth.  Stainless steel producers face overcapacity in Europe and
may look at consolidation to cut costs, Chief Financial Officer
 Aditya Mittal  said. The spinoff would take place at the start of
next year at the earliest, with the Mittal family keeping a
“substantial” stake, he said.  The unit reported earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of $191 million in the second
quarter on sales of $1.54 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
