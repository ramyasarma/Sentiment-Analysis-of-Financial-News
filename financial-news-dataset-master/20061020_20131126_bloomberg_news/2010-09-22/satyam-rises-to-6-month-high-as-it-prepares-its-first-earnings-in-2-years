Satyam Computer Services Ltd.  rose
to an eight-month high in Mumbai after saying it will report
annual earnings this month, its first since the software
exporter was embroiled in India’s biggest corporate fraud probe.  The  shares  rose as much as 15 percent to 109.45 rupees, the
highest intraday level since Jan. 21. The stock changed hands at
107.70 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai.  Satyam, which delayed reporting its accounts after former
Chairman  Ramalinga Raju  disclosed in January 2009 that he
overstated the company’s assets by $1 billion, will announce
audited  earnings  for the fiscal years ended March 2009 and 2010,
on Sept. 29, spokesman  Sridhar Maturi  said.  Tech Mahindra Ltd. ,
which acquired Satyam, may absorb the company following the
earnings announcement, said  Naushil Shah , an analyst at Anand
Rathi Financial Services Ltd.  “Once the numbers are out, and things are stabilized at
Satyam, they will want to merge it with Tech Mahindra,” said
Shah, based in Mumbai. He has a “hold” rating on shares of
Tech Mahindra.  Satyam may report a profit of 6.27 billion rupees for the
year ended March 31, 2009, and 4 billion rupees for the
following year, according to the average of two  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Government Takeover  Tech Mahindra’s corporate communications department didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Shares of  Tech Mahindra  rose 8.3 percent to close at 787.95
rupees in Mumbai trading. Tech Mahindra is partly owned by BT
Group Plc and India’s largest sport-utility vehicle maker
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.  Raju’s admission and resignation on Jan. 7, 2009, triggered
a stock slump and a government takeover that led to the sale of
the company to Tech Mahindra. Satyam in June had sought time
until Sept. 30 from the government to file its financial results.  Raju won bail from a court in Hyderabad last month, his
lawyer S. Bharat Kumar said by telephone on Aug. 18.  Shares of Satyam have fallen 40 percent since Jan. 6, 2009,
compared with a 93 percent gain in the Bombay Stock Exchange’s
benchmark Sensitive Index in the period.  Tech Mahindra, the software company based in Pune, India,
 owns  42.6 percent of Satyam Computer. It gained control of
Satyam in May last year after winning an auction held by a
government-nominated board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
