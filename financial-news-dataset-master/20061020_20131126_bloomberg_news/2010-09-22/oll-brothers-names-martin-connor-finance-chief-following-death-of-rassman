Toll Brothers Inc. , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, named  Martin P. Connor  chief financial
officer to replace  Joel Rassman , who died earlier this month.  Connor had been assistant chief financial officer since
late 2008, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company said in a
statement today. The appointment is effective immediately.  “Marty’s background, long history with the company and
intimate knowledge of financial systems, management and board of
directors will make this a seamless transition,” Chief
Executive Officer  Douglas Yearley  said in the statement.  Rassman, who was 65, was Toll Brothers’ chief financial
officer since 1984 and a  board  member since 1996. He died Sept.
14 after being diagnosed with leukemia in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
