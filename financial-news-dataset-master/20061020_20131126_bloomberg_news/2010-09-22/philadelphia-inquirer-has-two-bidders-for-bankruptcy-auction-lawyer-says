The Philadelphia Inquirer and its
sister newspaper will have two bidders competing to buy them out
of bankruptcy at an auction in which the opening offer is less
than half the value of a deal that fell apart this month.  Lenders who backed out of their promise to buy the company
for $139 million on Sept. 14, will compete with Raymond
Perelman, father of billionaire Ronald Perelman, said Lawrence
G. McMichael, an attorney who represents the holding company
that owns the two newspapers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
