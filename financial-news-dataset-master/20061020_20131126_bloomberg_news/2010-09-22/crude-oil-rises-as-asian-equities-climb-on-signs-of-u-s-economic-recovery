Crude oil rose in New York,
reversing some of yesterday’s decline, as Asian equities gained
after the Federal Reserve signaled it will act to maintain the
recovery in the economy.  Oil climbed after the MSCI Asia Pacific Index reached the
highest level in almost five months. The dollar weakened to a
six-week low against the euro, bolstering the investment appeal
of commodities. An Energy Department report will probably show
that U.S. oil supplies shrank 1.75 million barrels from 357.4
million last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey. A
report from the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute
yesterday showed supplies gained.  “A rally would find further support from the dollar,”
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said in a report today. “Huge discrepancies often
exist between the API and Department of Energy report, and we
have the feeling this is going to be one of those weeks.”  The November contract climbed as much as 39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $75.36 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $75.20 a barrel at 2:05 p.m.
Yesterday it lost $1.22, or 1.6 percent, to $74.97.  Crude for October delivery slipped $1.34, or 1.8 percent,
to $73.52 a barrel yesterday, the lowest closing price since Aug.
31. The contract expired at the end of floor trading.  API Report  Futures declined yesterday after the American Petroleum
Institute said crude inventories increased 2.23 million barrels
to 364.1 million. This is the highest  level  for this time of
year in the past five years. Refineries probably ran at 86.8
percent of capacity last week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts before an Energy Department report today.  Oil also fell yesterday as Labor Department figures
released in Washington showed payrolls dropped in 36 U.S. states
in August, indicating the market will take time to rebound from
the recession.  Supplies  of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point
for New York futures fell by 219,000 barrels to 34.8 million,
the API data showed. Inventories in the U.S. Midwest and the
Gulf Coast, home to a majority of the country’s refining
capacity fell.  The dollar slid to $1.33 per euro as of 1:10 p.m. in Tokyo
from $1.3264 yesterday in New York, after earlier reaching
$1.3314, the weakest level since Aug. 6.  The premium between the November New York oil future and
December contract narrowed to $1.59 a barrel today. It was as
wide as $1.75 on Sept. 17.  U.S. gasoline  demand rebounded  from a 23-month low last
week, MasterCard Inc. reported yesterday. Motorists bought an
average 9.01 million barrels a day of the motor fuel, up 1.9
percent from the prior week, according to the weekly
SpendingPulse report. It was the first increase in five weeks.  Brent crude for November settlement fell as much as 42
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $78 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, and was at $78.35. Yesterday, it
slipped 90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $78.42.  November Brent’s premium to the New York contract was at
$3.20 a barrel today after reaching $3.45 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
