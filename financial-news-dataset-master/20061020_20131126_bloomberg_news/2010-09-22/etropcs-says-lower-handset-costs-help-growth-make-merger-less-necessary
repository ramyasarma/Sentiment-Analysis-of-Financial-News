MetroPCS Communications Inc. Chief
Executive Officer  Roger Linquist  said falling phone prices make
it easier for the carrier to grow by itself, meaning a merger
with  Leap Wireless International Inc.  would be less necessary.  “Growth for us in the future is very, very much
different” than in 2007, when MetroPCS discussed a merger with
San Diego-based  Leap , Linquist said at a conference today.
“It’s not so sensitive to what kind of a deal you have with
your infrastructure provider; it really comes down to handsets
and what you can buy handsets at discount for.”  Linquist, who spoke at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. event in
New York, said many handsets on new, so-called fourth-generation
networks will cost less than $100 in the future. Profit at
MetroPCS, which sells prepaid wireless services, more than
tripled last quarter as customer gains beat analysts’ estimates.  MetroPCS, based in Dallas, added 29 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $10.15 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
 trading , to its highest level since August 2009. Leap fell 25
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $10.45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
