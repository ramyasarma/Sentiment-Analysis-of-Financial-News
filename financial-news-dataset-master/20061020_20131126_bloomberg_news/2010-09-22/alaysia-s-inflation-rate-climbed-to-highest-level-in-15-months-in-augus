Malaysia’s  inflation  rate climbed
in August to the highest level in 15 months, a gain that may put
pressure on the central bank to consider resuming interest-rate
increases after pausing this month.  Consumer prices rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier after
gaining 1.9 percent in July, the Putrajaya, Malaysia-based
statistics department said in a statement today. That compares
with the median forecast for a 2 percent increase in a Bloomberg
News  survey  of 16 economists.  Bank Negara Malaysia left its  benchmark overnight policy
rate  at 2.75 percent on Sept. 2 after three consecutive
increases, choosing to support growth as the global recovery
slows. Still, it said Malaysia’s growth will be supported by
“robust domestic economic activity” even as the external
developments may moderate the pace of expansion.  Accelerating inflation is “a signal of more robust
economic activity and stronger consumer sentiment,”  Kristina Fong , an economist at RAM Holdings Bhd., a Malaysian ratings
provider, said in an e-mail before the release. “We expect
further tightening of monetary policy towards the end of the
year if the recovery momentum is maintained.”  The central bank next meets to decide on interest rates on
Nov. 12.  Food prices, which account for about 31 percent of
Malaysia’s inflation index, rose 3.1 percent in August, today’s
report showed. The cost of housing, utilities and fuels gained
1.3 percent. Transport increased 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
