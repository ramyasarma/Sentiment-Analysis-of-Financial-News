India’s rupee climbed for a sixth
day, the longest winning streak since March, as the country’s
accelerating economic growth attracts record investment from
overseas into local stocks.  The currency touched the strongest level since May as
India’s Bombay Stock Exchange  Sensitive Index  reached levels not
seen since January 2008. The gauge has climbed 11 percent since
the government on Aug. 31 reported gross domestic product
increased  8.8 percent  last quarter, the fastest pace since 2007.  “The rupee’s bias is becoming increasingly positive,”
said  Sudarshan Bhatt , Mumbai-based chief foreign-exchange trader
at state-owned Corporation Bank. “Investment inflows are
quickening as economic optimism strengthens.”  The rupee appreciated 0.2 percent to 45.59 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 45.44 earlier, the highest level
since May 14. It has climbed 3.3 percent this month, the best
performance among Asian currencies after South Korea’s won.  India’s currency will strengthen to 44.90 in the next 30
days and to 43.50 in the coming three months, Bhatt predicted.  Offshore forwards indicated the rupee will trade at 46.10
to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
46.20 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled
in dollars.  Funds based abroad have increased investment in local
stocks every day this month, boosting  holdings  to an all-time
high of $89 billion on Sept. 20, exchange data show. Investors
pumped $16.2 billion into equities so far this year, 60 percent
more than in the same period of 2009.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
