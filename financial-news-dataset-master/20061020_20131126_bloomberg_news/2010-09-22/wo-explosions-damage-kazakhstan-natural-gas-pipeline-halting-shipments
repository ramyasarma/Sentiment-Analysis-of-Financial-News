Two explosions in western
Kazakhstan damaged a pipeline carrying natural gas in the
country, the Emergency Ministry said in a statement.  Flows were halted as emergency workers sought to extinguish
the fires caused by the blasts, the ministry said.  The pipeline was originally designated to transport gas
from Turkmenistan in the south. State-run AO Inter Gas Central
Asia had reversed the flow to deliver gas from Beineu to Uzen in
western Kazakhstan before the explosions, Sergei Sarsenov, an
official at the company’s Aktau-based unit, said by phone today.  He declined to say when the gas flow may start.  Madina Makhanova, a spokeswoman at Astana-based Inter Gas
Central Asia, wasn’t immediately available to comment when
reached on her office telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
