Canadian stocks  fell for a second
day, led by financial companies, after Canadian retail sales and
U.S. home prices decreased.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-biggest
insurer, lost 4.6 percent after the U.S. government said home
prices retreated for an eighth month. Barrick Gold Corp., the
world’s largest gold producer, advanced 1.3 percent as the metal
closed at a record $1,292.10 an ounce. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest energy company by
market value, decreased 2.1 percent as crude oil slumped to a
three-week low.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 23.31
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,147.26 after gaining 2.2 percent
from Aug. 31 through yesterday. The MSCI World Index surged 8.2
percent in the same period. The  index  of developed-market stocks
hasn’t gained that much in a month since July 2009.  “People are looking at the rise in markets that occurred
since first of September and trying to figure out, in case of
economic uncertainty, is that realistic?” said  Robert McWhirter , who oversees C$140 million ($136 million) as a money
manager at Selective Asset Management Inc. in Toronto.  Seven of eight Canadian publicly traded insurers and seven
of eight banks declined after Statistics Canada reported that
retail sales dropped 0.1 percent in July from June. The median
forecast of 15 economists in a  Bloomberg survey  was for a 0.6
percent gain, and none of them had predicted a gain less than
0.5 percent.  U.S. Home Prices  Prices of U.S. homes decreased 0.5 percent in July from the
previous month, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said today in
Washington. Economists had forecast a retreat of  0.2 percent ,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Manulife lost 4.6 percent to C$12.79. Toronto-Dominion
Bank, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets, fell 1.4 percent
to C$74.22. Laurentian Bank of Canada, the country’s seventh-
largest bank, dropped for a seventh day, declining 2.1 percent
to C$42.90.  Most  S&P/TSX energy stocks  declined as crude oil slipped
after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in
inventories.  Canadian Natural lost 2.1 percent to C$33.47. Suncor Energy
Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, slipped 1.5 percent
to C$32.35. Niko Resources Ltd., which produces oil and gas in
 South Asia , decreased 3.4 percent to C$97.85.  FOMC Statement  The U.S. dollar retreated as much as 1.1 percent against a
basket of world currencies a day after the Fed’s Open Market
Committee said it might need to take more action to recharge the
economy.  An  index  of S&P/TSX gold companies rose for a third day as
the metal advanced 1.4 percent.  Barrick increased for a fifth day, rising 1.3 percent to
C$48.66. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s second-largest gold producer,
gained 0.8 percent to C$45.59. Silver reseller Silver Wheaton
Corp. climbed 3.4 percent to a record C$26.74 as that metal
surged 2 percent.  Base metals rallied with the declining U.S. dollar. Copper
futures rose 2.4 percent in New York.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, gained for the first time in seven days, rallying 2.3
percent to C$39.91. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is developing a
$4.6 billion copper and gold mine in Mongolia with Rio Tinto
Group, advanced 3.8 percent to a record C$22.73.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. increased 1.5
percent to C$49, after a 4.1 percent surge yesterday. The
company may release a tablet computer with a new operating
system at a conference next week, the Wall Street Journal
reported late yesterday, citing people familiar with the plans.  Baffinland Soars  Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., which owns iron deposits in
the Canadian Arctic, soared 68 percent, the most in six years,
to 94 Canadian cents after receiving an 80-cent-a-share takeover
offer from Iron Ore Holdings LP. The latter company is backed by
the Energy & Minerals Group, a Houston private-equity firm that
pools money from investors to take over companies, financing the
purchases mostly with debt, with the intention of selling them
later for a profit.  Agrium Inc., Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer,
climbed 2.2 percent to C$77.51 after  David Silver , an analyst at
Bank of America Corp., raised his rating on its shares to
“buy” from “neutral.” The stock should benefit from
investors who have received cash from acquisitions and want to
maintain a stake in the agriculture industry, Silver wrote in a
note.  Shoppers Drug Mart Corp., the country’s biggest drug-store
chain, rose for a ninth day, the longest streak in six years,
gaining 2.3 percent to C$39.30. The company yesterday had its
rating raised by Bank of America Corp. and said it will offer
financial services at its stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
