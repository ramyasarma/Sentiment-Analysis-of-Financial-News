The Turkish lira will strengthen to
its highest versus the euro since October 2008 as the economy
improves and a constitutional referendum reduces political risk,
according to Nordea Bank AB.  The bank raised its estimate for the lira to 1.9 per euro
in sixth months, 3.8 percent up on yesterday’s close of 1.9723,
compared with a previous projection of 2 per euro, the bank
wrote in a research report dated today. The lira is likely to
trade at 1.8 per euro in 12 months, just after Turkey’s general
elections, compared with a previous prediction of 2.1, the note
said.  “The economic recovery has exceeded our expectations,
political risks have fallen after the clear ‘yes’ vote in the
referendum for the constitutional changes and inflation risks
have changed somewhat,” Nordea analysts  Elisabeth Andreew  and
 Anders Svendsen , both based in Copenhagen, wrote in the note.  The referendum on a package of constitutional changes was
widely viewed as a preview of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan’s chances of winning a third term in office at general
elections to be held by July. Turkey’s economy grew an annual
10.3 percent in the second quarter, matching China’s as the
fastest expansion in the period among the Group of 20 major
economies, a Sept. 15 government report showed.  The currency last traded stronger than 1.8 per euro in
October 2008, a month after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., which deepened the global credit crisis.  The lira appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.4832 as of 12:51 p.m.
in Istanbul, its strongest intraday level since April 30. The
yield on Turkish benchmark bonds dropped 4 basis points to 8.06
percent, according to an ABN Amro index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
