Libyan authorities had informed
 UniCredit SpA  Chairman  Dieter Rampl  of their intention to invest
in the bank, La Stampa reported, citing Libya’s ambassador to
Rome, Hafed Gaddur.  “It’s untrue that the chairman was not aware” of the
Lybian investment, which led to a clash between shareholders and
Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo  and his resignation,
La Stampa quoted Gaddur as saying. He said Rampl “had been
informed by Tripoli,” according to the newspaper today.  A spokeswoman for Rampl in Milan wasn’t available to
comment when contacted by telephone by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
