CFS Retail Property Trust will seek
to raise A$500 million if it completes an acquisition of half of
Australian shopping center chain Direct Factory Outlet, the
Australian Financial Review said, without citing anyone.  DFO’s parent Austexx and CFS Retail are negotiating a sale
that may be valued at A$600 million, while shares of the trust
were halted yesterday before an announcement of a
“significant” transaction, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
