German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said that he doesn’t see a major dispute among Group
of 20 nations over exit strategies.  Speaking to reporters in Berlin today after talks with
South Korean Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun, Schaeuble said
that Germany shows deficit cuts can still aid econmic growth.  Yoon said that the G-20 agrees deficit reduction measures
must be “growth-friendly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
