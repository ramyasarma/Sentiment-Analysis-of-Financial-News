Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker run by  Fiat SpA , said proposals from dealers seeking
to sell Fiat vehicles in the U.S. exceeded its expectations.  The automaker’s dealers face a deadline today to submit
proposals for a franchise to sell the Italian brand. Chrysler
has said it wants Fiat franchises in about 165 locations.  “The response from our dealers has exceeded our
expectations,” Ralph Kisiel, a spokesman for Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based Chrysler, said in an e-mail. “We now will begin
reviewing the proposals and look forward to naming our Fiat
dealers in the next few weeks.”  He declined to say how many dealers applied. Chrysler has
said winners will be announced in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
