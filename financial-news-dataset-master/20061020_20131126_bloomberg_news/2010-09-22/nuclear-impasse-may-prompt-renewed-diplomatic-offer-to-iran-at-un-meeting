The U.S. and other world powers
will assess the impact of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear
pursuits at a meeting today at the United Nations, while holding
out the prospect of diplomacy to resolve the dispute.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and her counterparts
from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia will “speak in
one voice” to Iran,  Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the  UN ,
told reporters.  Rice cautioned last week not to “expect anything
dramatic” from today’s meeting and said the governments would
examine where they stand on “the pressure side, as well as
engagement” in their strategy to shift Iran’s position. Iran
has rejected demands that it slow its nuclear program, amid
international concerns the effort is designed to create a
weapons capability.  “Iran has to demonstrate that it is prepared to engage
constructively,” State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley 
told reporters in New York late yesterday. “If it is, we’ll
respond.”  China and Russia voted with the U.S., Britain and France on
June 9 as the UN  Security Council  adopted its fourth set of
sanctions on Iran, intended to prevent development of nuclear
weapons or ballistic missiles. All of the UN resolutions demand
that Iran stop enriching uranium, the key ingredient for
producing nuclear power or bombs.  The only meeting announced so far in New York among Iran
and the six countries will involve Iranian Foreign Minister
 Manouchehr Mottaki  and U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague .  Iranian Signals  So far, Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  has sent
mixed signals about his stance. He told ABC’s “This Week”
program on Sept. 19 that Iran was “ready to discuss” its
nuclear program with a group of countries that includes the U.S.
Yesterday he said that a U.S. attack on Iran to destroy its
nuclear facilities would start a war unlike any America has ever
experienced.  “What we do is legal,” Ahmadinejad said at a meeting with
invited reporters yesterday in New York, according to the New
York Times. “The United States has never entered a real war,
not in Vietnam, nor in Afghanistan, nor even World War II. War
is just not bombing someplace. When it starts it has no
limits.”  Financial Pressure  In July, the U.S. blocked access to the American financial
system for banks doing business in Iran. The European Union
followed, banning investment and sales of equipment to Iran’s
oil and natural-gas industries.  Stuart Levey , the U.S. Treasury Department official who is
an architect of the financial pressure, said Sept. 20 in
Washington that Iran is “struggling to mitigate the effects of
sanctions.”  Iran, home to the world’s No. 2 oil and gas reserves,
insists it wants to develop nuclear technology for peaceful
purposes. Its nuclear program has been under UN investigation
since 2003, and inspectors say Iran hasn’t given them sufficient
access or evidence to prove the program is civilian in nature.  “The effort must be concentrated outside the UN now,”
 Sami Alfaraj , head of the Kuwait Center for Strategic Studies,
said in a telephone interview from Washington. “There is not
much to be done there. We are in a stage where we need to fine
tune what already exists and put Iran on notice that it may risk
further sanctions in the future if and only if it does this or
that.”  Limits on Pressure  Though Rice and U.K. Ambassador  Mark Lyall Grant  said on
Sept. 15 that the Security Council should “consider an
appropriate response” to Iran’s launch in August of a missile
that could be adapted to carry nuclear weapons, that is
unlikely, according to  Ilan Berman , vice president of the
Washington-based  American Foreign Policy Council.  The six nations “move along at the pace of its most
grudging members,” Berman said. He said China’s energy demands
are driving promises of investment in oil development in Iran.  For the moment, Berman said, the sanctions track is a
“dead process.”  Robert J. Einhorn , the U.S. State Department’s special
adviser on enforcement of Iran and North Korea sanctions, will
visit China next week.  Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov , speaking yesterday
at the UN, appeared to criticize sanctions imposed by the U.S.,
EU and other nations such as South Korea following the Security
Council action in June.  “We cannot help but express our serious concern with the
persisting practice of unilateral coercive measures,” Lavrov
said, without naming any countries. He said such measures exceed
the authority given by the Security Council and “must be
brought to an end.”  Obama Message  One of President  Barack Obama ’s main messages on Iran
during his three days in New York will be that the engagement
track isn’t dead, according to  Ben Rhodes , the U.S. deputy
national security adviser for strategic communications.  “I think he intends to make very clear what he has always
said, which is that the door is open to the Iranian
government,” Rhodes said. “The door is open to them having a
better relationship with the United States. The president again
will want to underscore and continue to underscore that his is a
dual-track approach. Sanctions are not an end in themselves.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
