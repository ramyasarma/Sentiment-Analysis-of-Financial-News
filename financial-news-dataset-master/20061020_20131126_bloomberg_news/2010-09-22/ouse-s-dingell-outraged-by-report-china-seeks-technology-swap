U.S. Representative  John Dingell , a
Michigan Democrat, said he is outraged China’s government may
force automakers to surrender electric-vehicle technology in
return for selling cars in the world’s most populous nation.  Such a requirement would violate “the sanctity of the
intellectual property laws we hold so dear in the United
States,” Dingell said in a statement e-mailed today from his
Washington office. The step would violate Chinese obligations as
a World Trade Organization member, he said.  China is considering the transfer requirement, which would
“damage trade relations between our two nations,” Dingell
wrote in a  letter  to Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the
U.S., citing a Sept. 16 Wall Street Journal story. Dingell’s
office released the letter today.  Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, didn’t immediately return telephone or e-mail
requests for comment.  Automakers including  Toyota Motor Corp ., General Motors Co.
and Shenzen, China-based  BYD Co ., which is backed by Warren
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., plan to increase output of
alternative energy-powered vehicles to meet demand in China, the
world’s biggest auto market.  China aims to become the world’s largest market for
renewable-energy vehicles by 2020, according to an Aug. 4
Shanghai Securities News report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
