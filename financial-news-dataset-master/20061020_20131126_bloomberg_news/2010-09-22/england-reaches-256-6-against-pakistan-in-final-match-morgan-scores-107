Eoin Morgan scored 107 not out as
England set Pakistan a victory target of 257 in the fifth and
decisive one-day cricket match at Southampton.  The hosts, who won the toss, were struggling at 47-3 before
Ian Bell (28), Morgan and Paul Collingwood restored stability.  Collingwood retired not out with a migraine for a spell
before returning to action, and was finally bowled by Umar Gul
after making 47 with the score at 199-5.  Morgan went on to complete his fourth century in a one-day
international, he and Tim Bresnan (18) putting on an unbeaten
stand of 54 runs in 28 balls before England finished its
allotted 50 overs on 256-6.  Shoaib Akhtar took 3-40, dismissing Jonathan Trott, captain
Andrew Strauss and Luke Wright.  The series is tied 2-2 after Pakistan won the fourth match
by 38 runs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
