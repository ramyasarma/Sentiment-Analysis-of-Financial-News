Australian Climate Change Minister
Greg Combet said all options for putting a price on emissions
will be considered by Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s minority
government, including a carbon tax.  “Alternative policy options will come on to the table,”
Combet said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp.
television last night. Parliament’s new committee on climate
change will look at all options because “the circumstances are
a bit different that we anticipated” before the Aug. 21
election when the focus of Gillard’s Labor Party was on moving
towards a carbon-trading proposal after 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
