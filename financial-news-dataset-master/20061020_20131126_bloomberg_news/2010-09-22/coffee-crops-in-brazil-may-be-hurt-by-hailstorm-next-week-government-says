Coffee crops in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower, may be hurt by hailstorms next week when a cold
front approaches major producing regions, a government weather
forecaster said.  The cold front is set to reach the southeastern states of
Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo on Sept. 30 following
a spell of hot weather, said  Expedito Rebello , head of research
at the government’s Meteorology Institute, known as Inmet.  “The combination of high temperature and a cold front may
cause a thermal shock and raise chances of hailstorms,” said
Rebello in a telephone interview from Brasilia today.  Coffee crops in Brazil’s southeast, which account for about
85 percent of the country’s output, have faced dryness since
April and need rains this month as trees start flowering to
produce beans for next year’s harvest.  Between 150 and 200 millimeters (5.9 and 7.9 inches) of
rain may fall in the seven days starting Sept. 30, Rebello said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
