Axiom Telecom LLC , a Dubai-based
mobile-phone retailer, may sell shares next month in the United
Arab Emirates’ first initial public offering in more than a
year, a person familiar with the plan said.  Shuaa Capital PSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest investment bank, is
the book-runner for the transaction, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the sale details have yet to
be made public. Axiom plans to sell 35 percent of its shares,
the person said. The IPO was planned for this year with Deutsche
Bank AG as the sole arranger, and the shares will be listed on
Nasdaq Dubai, Reuters reported yesterday.  Middle Eastern companies delayed share sales as regional
economies recovered from the impact of the worst global
recession since the Great Depression. The last IPO in the U.A.E.
was in March 2009 by  Green Crescent Insurance Co. , an Abu Dhabi-
based provider of health insurance products.  Axiom Telecom is 40 percent owned by Dubai Holding
Commercial Operations Group LLC, a company owned by Dubai ruler
 Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum .  Dubai-based spokesmen at Shuaa and Deutsche Bank declined
to comment when reached by telephone and an e-mail today. Axiom
officials were not immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
