Hypo Real Estate Holding AG , which
was rescued by the German government following the country’s
biggest bank failure since World War II, will transfer 191.1
billion euros ($256 billion) of assets to a bad bank.  The portfolio of credits, securities and derivatives will
be moved to FMS Wertmanagement as of Sept. 30 and the entity
will have capital of as much as 3.87 billion euros, Germany’s
Soffin bank-rescue fund said in an e-mailed statement today.
Including an additional 2.08 billion euros in fresh capital that
will be transferred to FMS, Hypo Real Estate will have received
a total of 9.95 billion euros from Soffin, it said.  The lender, based in Munich and wholly owned by Soffin,
applied in January to transfer non-strategic assets to a bad
bank. Hypo Real Estate has said it doesn’t expect to return to
profit before 2012. It needed a total of 142 billion euros in
credit lines and debt guarantees from the state and financial
institutions to save it from collapse.  The transfer is a “significant precondition to further
stabilize and successfully restructure Hypo Real Estate,”
Soffin head  Hannes Rehm  said in today’s statement. The asset
move is pending approval from the European Commission, according
to the statement.  Hypo Real Estate will focus on real estate and public-
sector financing in Germany and Europe with a new core bank
named pbb Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, the lender said separately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
