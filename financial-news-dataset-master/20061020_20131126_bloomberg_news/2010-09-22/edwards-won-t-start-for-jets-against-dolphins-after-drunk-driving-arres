(Corrects attribution in third paragraph.)  Braylon Edwards  won’t start against
Miami in four days after being charged with driving while
intoxicated, New York Jets General Manager  Mike Tannenbaum  said.  “When he plays will be determined by coach Ryan,”
Tannenbaum told the National Football League team’s website
after a meeting last night with coach  Rex Ryan  and owner  Woody Johnson .  Wide receiver Edwards, 27, was arrested yesterday on a New
York City street when police stopped his 2007 Land Rover for
excessive tint on the windows and noticed a strong odor of
alcohol, a New York Police Department spokeswoman said.
Edwards’s breath test showed a blood alcohol content of 0.15,
almost twice the state’s legal limit of 0.08.  “We’ll let everything run its course,” Tannenbaum said.
“When the case is fully adjudicated, he will be subject to
disciplinary measures under the NFL’s substance abuse policy.”  Tackle  D’Brickashaw Ferguson  and defensive end  Vernon Gholston , who were in the vehicle with Edwards, won’t be
punished, Tannenbaum said. All three are expected at practice
today.  Edwards caught five passes for 45 yards and a touchdown in
the Jets’ 28-14 victory over the New England Patriots three days
ago. Since joining the Jets in the middle of last season, he has
caught five touchdown passes and has 595 yards receiving.  Edwards was charged last year with punching a man in a
fight in Cleveland shortly before being traded to the Jets from
the Cleveland Browns, the New York Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
