Vision Capital Advisors LLC, a New
York-based hedge-fund and buyout firm, said the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission has asked it for information and it is
cooperating with the request.  “We are cooperating with the SEC’s request for
information,”  Jonathan Gasthalter , a spokesman for Vision
Capital, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The SEC is investigating Vision Capital and has sent
subpoenas to investment firms that have done business with the
company, Reuters reported today. The SEC is seeking e-mails,
transaction documents and other communications between Vision
Capital and the investment firms going back to 2005, the news
service reported.  Vision says it manages more than $700 million, investing
in public and private companies, according to its website. The
firm was co-founded by  Adam Benowitz  and Randolph Cohen in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
