The number of initial public stock
offerings in Japan will probably more than double in the second
half of this fiscal year, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.’s
Hiromichi Ishii.  The number of IPOs will rise to about 25 in the six months
to March 31 from 9 in the previous half year, said Ishii,
managing director of the IPO department at Tokyo-based Nomura,
the top-ranked underwriter of domestic initial share sales in 10
of the past 12 years.  “IPOs by so-called defensive companies resilient to the
economic slowdown have been increasing, and that trend is likely
to continue,” Ishii said in an interview in Tokyo on Sept. 15.  Health-related companies constituted half of the total
initial offerings by value in Japan in the year ended March 31,
a jump from 15 percent a year earlier and 1.5 percent the year
before that, he said.  “Electronic-parts makers expected to report positive
earnings from the market recovery are also likely to be
listed,” Ishii said.  The number of IPOs in Japan tumbled to 19 last fiscal year
from 187 in the year ended March 2007, according to Nomura.  “We may also start to see IPOs from companies that have
gone through restructuring after having been delisted three to
four years ago through management buyouts,” Ishii said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
