Telus Corp. , Canada’s third-largest
wireless phone company, said Shaw Communications Inc.’s
assurance that it won’t stop competitors from distributing its
television content over wireless devices doesn’t eliminate the
need for clearer rules from the regulator.  It would be “ highly beneficial” for the  Canadian Radio-
television and Telecommunications Commission  to give clear
rules, “despite the commitment by Shaw that it will not enter
into exclusive content distribution arrangements and that it
will make content available to all distributors,”  Michael Hennessy , Telus’s senior vice president for regulatory affairs,
said today at  public hearings  into Shaw’s C$2 billion ($1.9
billion) purchase of Canwest Global Communications Corp.’s
television assets.  Ken Stein , Shaw’s chief of regulatory affairs, told the
hearings yesterday that the company would sell and trade its
content with competitors, the National Post reported.  Telus, which  competes  with Shaw and BCE Inc., said prior to
the hearings it wants the CRTC to impose “unequivocal and
enforceable rules” to stop Shaw from engaging in “abuse of
market power.” If it agrees, the CRTC would impose rules for
the first time on how television content is delivered to cell
phones.  “The Commission can lay out general principles with
respect to exclusivity and fair dealing in this proceeding,”
Hennessy said, according to the text of a prepared statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
