Yale University women’s ice hockey
player  Mandi Schwartz  was undergoing a stem-cell transplant
today in hopes of re-growing the infection-fighting white blood
cells she needs to survive.  Doctors, who eradicated her cancer cells with multiple
chemotherapy and radiation treatments Sept. 15 through 20 at the
 University of Washington Medical Center  in Seattle, now will use
stem cells from two, anonymous umbilical-cord blood donors to
re-grow healthy, cancer-free cells.  “She can be one very aggressive girl,” Mandi’s mother,
Carol, wrote on her website. “She will win!”  Yale’s athletic department held drives each of the past two
springs, registering more than 1,600 people with the National
Marrow Donor Program’s “Be The Match” registry. Drives held in
Canada added another 2,600 to the Canadian version of the
registry.  Schwartz, 22, an economics major from Wilcox, Saskatchewan,
was initially diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia -- a cancer
that starts inside the bone marrow and grows from cells that
were supposed to become white blood cells -- in December of
2008.  When doctors couldn’t find a bone marrow donor, they turned
to umbilical cord blood.  Mandi’s parents, Carol and Rick, and Mandi’s fiance, Kaylem
Prefontaine, traveled to Seattle for the operation. Her younger
brothers, Jaden, and Rylan, both ice hockey players at Colorado
College, visited. Jaden was selected in the first round (No. 14
overall) of the National Hockey League draft by the St. Louis
Blues in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
