Pumpkin Patch Ltd. , which sells
children’s apparel in New Zealand, Australia and the U.S., said
full-year profit rose 76 percent as the company cut costs to
cope with falling sales.  Net income rose to NZ$25.5 million ($18.7 million) in the
12 months ended July 31, from NZ$14.5 million in the year-
earlier period, the Auckland-based company said today in a
 statement . The 2009 profit figure excludes one-off costs
incurred when  Pumpkin Patch  closed some U.S. stores. Revenue
fell 11 percent in 2010 to NZ$382 million as consumer demand
slumped across most of the company’s global markets.  This ‘is a very strong result considering the subdued
retail environments we faced,” Pumpkin Patch Chief Executive
Officer  Maurice Prendergast  said in the statement. “We expect
to open at least 22 new stores in the coming year to take
advantage of the significant growth potential our retail markets
have to offer.”  Sales  in Australia fell 3 percent from a year earlier and 6
percent in New Zealand, excluding temporary stores set up in
2009 to clear excess stock, the company said. The company’s
revenue from the U.S. and the U.K. fell in New Zealand dollar
terms as the currency rose 12 percent against the U.S. dollar
during the 12 months to July 31.  Pumpkin Patch this year launched a stand-alone Charlie & Me
brand and expects to open at least seven stores in Australia and
New Zealand in 2011.  The  stock  was unchanged at NZ$1.95 at 10:45 a.m. in
Wellington trading. The company increased its dividend 27
percent to 9.5 cents per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
