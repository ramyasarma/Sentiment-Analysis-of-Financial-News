Hungarian  retail sales  rose in
July, ending a 41-month decline, as the economy recovered from
its worst recession in 18 years.  Sales advanced 1.7 percent from a year earlier after a 4.6
percent drop in June, the Budapest-based  statistics office  said
today in an e-mailed statement. It was the first increase since
January 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
median estimate of four economists in a Bloomberg survey was for
a 3 percent decline. Sales rose 1 percent on the month.  “Domestic demand starting to come around is a welcome
sign,” said  Gergely Suppan , an economist at Takarekbank Zrt. in
Budapest. “There may even be more dynamic economic growth in
the second half than we previously expected.”  Retail sales started dropping in 2007, when budget cuts to
narrow a record  deficit  left consumers with less money to spend.
The decline continued as Hungary suffered its worst recession
since 1991, which ended in the fourth quarter.  The forint traded at 278.77 per euro at 10 a.m. in Budapest
from 280.38 late yesterday, its strongest since Aug. 19.  The July increase in retail sales was in part the result of
base effect from the trough of the recession, Suppan said. The
forint’s weakness against the Swiss franc may still limit the
spending power of Hungarians who took out mortgages and car
loans in the Alpine currency, he said.  The forint has fallen 15 percent against the franc in the
past 12 months, the biggest drop among European currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
