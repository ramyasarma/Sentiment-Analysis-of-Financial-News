Afghanistan’s government signed an
agreement to have China Metallurgical Group Corp. build a rail
corridor in that country, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
Afghan Minister for Mines Waheedullah Shahrani.  The line will link the Aynak copper mine in Logar province
with Kabul and the border towns of Torkham and Hyratan, the news
agency said. The study and survey process for the railroad will
take two years, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
