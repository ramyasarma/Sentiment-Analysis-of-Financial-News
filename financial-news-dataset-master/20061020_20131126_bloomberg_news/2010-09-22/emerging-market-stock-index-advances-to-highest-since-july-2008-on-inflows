Emerging-market currencies rallied
against the dollar, with the rand hitting its highest level
since January 2008, on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
ease monetary policy further.  The rand appreciated 1.9 percent, the most in four months,
after South Africa’s current-account gap fell to a six-year low
and the Fed said yesterday it would provide additional monetary
“accommodation” if needed. The Czech koruna, Polish zloty and
Hungarian forint gained more than 2 percent. The dollar-based
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index  climbed 0.5 percent to 1,048.69 at
1:38 p.m. in London, poised for its highest close since July
2008, as the dollar value of emerging equities rose. Stocks
fell in local-currency terms in Russia and Poland.  Treasuries hit an all-time low after the Fed meeting on
speculation the U.S. central bank will purchase additional
government securities in a bid to lower long-term interest
rates, widening the yield differential between the U.S. and
emerging-market countries.  “What we’re seeing is a dollar move, and that is what is
driving the emerging-market currencies,” said  Robert Beange ,
head of emerging-market strategy at RBC Capital Markets in
London. “The Fed marginally edged closer to another round of
quantitative easing,” or large-scale asset purchases, he said.  The difference between the return that investors demand
from developing-nation sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasuries lost
1 basis point to 2.92 percent, according to the  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. EMBI+ Index . The gap widened as 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell
2.2 basis points to 2.553 percent.  Current Account  South Africa’s current-account gap, the broadest measure of
the country’s trade with the world, eased to 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product in the second quarter, the central bank
said. The rand has appreciated more than 30 percent versus the
dollar since the start of last year. The key central bank rate
in South Africa is 6 percent versus 0.25 percent in the U.S.  Gold bullion for immediate delivery rose 1.5 percent to a
record $1,292.90 an ounce on the London Metal Exchange and
copper for three-month delivery gained 0.9 percent as a weaker
dollar bolstered the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments.  The forint advanced 2.1 percent against the dollar to
208.36 and 0.5 percent versus the euro to 278.89. The budget
deficit of Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern
member, will be about 2.8 percent of economic output in 2011,
 Andras Karman , a state secretary at the Economy Ministry, told
Magyar Nemzet newspaper. That would be in line with the target
of the International Monetary Fund, which broke off loan talks
with Hungary in July due to disagreement over deficit targets.  The koruna appreciated 2.3 percent against the dollar and
the zloty gained 2.1 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index  lost 0.3
percent after yesterday rallying above 20,000 for the first time
since January 2008. Thai  stocks  rose 0.8 percent to a new high
of 945.  To contact the reporter on this story:
