Pakistan’s central bank will sell
75 billion rupees ($872 million) of treasury bills today at
yields higher than in the previous auction, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  The State Bank of Pakistan will offer benchmark six-month
securities at 12.82 percent, according to the median forecast of
six money-market dealers and three analysts. The monetary
authority will sell three-month bills at 12.65 percent and one-
year notes at 12.89 percent.  It auctioned three-month securities at 12.61 percent and
six-month as well as one-year bills at 12.79 percent on Sept. 8.  The central bank plans to raise 535 billion rupees from
treasury bills in the quarter that ends Sept. 30, according to
its website. The State Bank of Pakistan increased its discount
rate, or the benchmark interest rate, by half a percentage point
to 13 percent on July 30.  Treasury-bill auctions, held every two weeks, are an
indication of the central bank’s stance on lending to commercial
banks. The central bank will unveil the results of the sale
after 2 p.m. local time. Pakistan raised 75.1 billion rupees at
the previous auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
