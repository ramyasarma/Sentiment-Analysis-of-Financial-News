The Vatican Bank’s communications
with Italy’s central bank were inadequate and this may have
prompted a probe into alleged violations of money-laundering
rules, la Repubblica reported, citing Vatican Bank chief  Ettore Gotti Tedeschi .  Communications between the Institute for Works of Religion,
or IOR, as the Vatican Bank is called, “always worked well” in
the past, Gotti Tedeschi told Repubblica in an interview
published today. “Relations with the Bank of Italy are good.”  Italian police yesterday temporarily seized 23 million
euros ($31 million) from an account registered to the IOR, as
Rome prosecutors probe Gotti Tedeschi for violations of money-
laundering laws. The Holy See in a statement yesterday expressed
“surprise” and “bewilderment” at the operation, and said it
has “full confidence” in Gotti Tedeschi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
