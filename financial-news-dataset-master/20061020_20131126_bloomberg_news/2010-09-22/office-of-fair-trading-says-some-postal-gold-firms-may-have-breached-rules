The U.K.’s  Office of Fair Trading 
said it is consulting with some companies that buy gold from
customers through the mail because they may have breached
consumer-protection legislation.  The authority asked some gold-buying companies to provide
details on business practices and explain claims made in
advertising. The OFT said it wanted to consider whether the
companies complied with consumer-protection laws, examining
issues such as whether customers’ rights to reject an offer for
their gold and receive the metal back were honored in all cases.  “The OFT is consulting with the companies to bring about a
cessation of the breaches it believes has occurred and seek
undertakings,” the authority said today in a statement on its
website. “In the absence of suitable undertakings, the OFT may
take appropriate court action.”  Pritie Billimoria, a London-based spokeswoman, was unable
to identify any of the companies or specify what laws may have
been breached. The OFT, tasked with ensuring markets work well
for consumers, said it aims to provide an update before the end
of the year.  Gold for immediate delivery has advanced 18 percent this
year. The metal reached a record $1,296.30 an ounce earlier
today and traded at $1,287.72 at 5:10 p.m. in London. Priced in
British pounds, bullion has gained 21 percent this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
