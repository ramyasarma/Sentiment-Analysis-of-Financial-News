Paris Hilton, the 29-year-old
socialite, flew home on a private jet after being denied entry
to Japan, according to Kazuo Kashihara, a spokesman at Narita
International Airport’s  immigration  office.  The socialite arrived in Tokyo yesterday and stayed
overnight at an  airport  hotel as officials debated whether to
allow her into Japan, said Kashihara, declining to provide
further information because of privacy reasons.  Hilton pleaded guilty in Las Vegas to a misdemeanor
drug charge on Monday; Japanese law forbids entry to those with
drug convictions, although exceptions can be made, the
Associated Press reported.  “ Paris Hilton  left around 4 p.m. today,” Kashihara said.
“I cannot comment on the investigation process, but Paris
Hilton arrived last night and was questioned, and was officially
denied access into Japan today.”  She had traveled to Japan to promote fashion and perfume
brands, and was scheduled to appear in a  promotional event  in
Roppongi today, according to Tsuyuka Yamashita, a spokeswoman at
the advertisement agency Sunnyside Up, which helped arrange the
event. The event was canceled, Yamashita said.  Hilton was also scheduled to fly to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
and Jakarta, Indonesia, according to the AP.  The socialite, who is a great-granddaughter of U.S.
hotelier  Conrad Hilton , wrote on her Twitter account, “About to
take off. Going home now. So dissappointed (sic) to miss my fans
in Asia. I promise to come back soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
