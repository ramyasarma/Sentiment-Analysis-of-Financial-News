The number of Asian hedge funds
reached a record 1,278 as more managers opened firms to tap
interest in the world’s fastest-growing economies, according to
 Eurekahedge Pte .  A total of 125 Asian hedge funds started in the first seven
months of the year, helping the total number in the region
exceed the previous high of 1,240 in 2007, the Singapore-based
data provider said in a report.  Asian hedge funds lost an average 0.4 percent this year
through August, after posting a 27 percent gain in 2009, the
strongest annual return on record, according to Eurekahedge. The
economies of China and India, the world’s most populous nations,
will expand 10.5 percent and 9.4 percent this year respectively,
the International Monetary Fund forecast in July.  More hedge funds are launching because of Asian economies’
“greater growth potential” as well as developments in the
industry that have made it easier to set up funds in the region,
Eurekahedge said.  Gains have been limited amid concerns that the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe may hinder economic expansion in emerging
nations, the report said. The Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index,
which tracks more than 2,500 funds worldwide, is up 1.7 percent
through August, compared with a 7.5 percent decline by the  MSCI
World Index  of shares.  Hedge funds are mostly private pools of capital whose
managers participate substantially in the profits from their
speculation on whether the price of assets will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
