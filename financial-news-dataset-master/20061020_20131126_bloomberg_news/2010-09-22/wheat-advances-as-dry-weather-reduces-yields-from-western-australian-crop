Wheat rose for the first time in
three days in Chicago after an industry group cut its estimate
for Western Australia production and Moscow-based researcher
SovEcon said Russia lowered its winter-grain sowing forecast.  December-delivery wheat gained as much as 1.4 percent to
$7.28 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, ending a 2.9
percent slump in the past two days. The contract traded at
$7.2775 a bushel at 12:02 p.m. Paris time.  Western Australia’s wheat crop may fall to 4.473 million
metric tons this harvest, from a previous forecast for 5.486
million tons, the Grain Industry Association of Western
Australia said in an e-mailed report today. Last year, the
region produced 8.248 million tons, according to the federal
government’s forecaster.  The forecast may be further reduced as “we have crops
trying to mature on almost nothing” and temperatures are
rising, Alan Meldrum, association project manager, said today.
Forecaster Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday that the region’s
wheat-growing areas will be mostly dry for seven days.  Wheat futures have surged about 59 percent over the past
year after drought ruined crops in Russia, prompting the nation
to suspend grain exports until after next year’s harvest.
Futures touched a 23-month high of $8.68 a bushel last month.  Russia lowered its forecast for winter-grain sowing by 18
percent to 15 million hectares (37 million acres) because the
soil is too dry for planting, SovEcon said, citing Agriculture
Ministry data.  Corn Climbs  Lower output in Western Australia may cut the nationwide
rise in wheat production forecast by the government on Sept 14.
Total output in 2010-2011 may be 25.1 million tons, compared
with a June estimate of 22.1 million and last year’s 21.7
million, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics-Bureau of Rural Sciences said that day.  Milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris slipped 1
percent to 229 euros ($306.59) a ton.  December-delivery corn climbed 1.1 percent to $5.11 a
bushel in Chicago, also ending two days of losses.  Corn will lead a fourth-quarter rally in grains and
oilseeds, beating wheat, as a La Nina threatens to parch crops
in Argentina and Brazil, curbing supplies and draining
inventories,  Wayne Gordon , an agricultural commodities analyst
at Rabobank Groep NV, said in an interview from Sydney
yesterday.  La Nina, characterized by colder-than-normal sea-surface
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, can cause below-average
rainfall in Argentina, southern Brazil and parts of the U.S.,
while bringing wetter-than-usual weather to Asia, according to
Telvent DTN. The weather pattern may strengthen through to
January, the U.S. Climate Prediction Center said on  Sept. 20 .  Harvests Curbed  The same weather pattern in 2008-2009 curbed harvests and
exports in Argentina and Brazil, Gordon said.  Corn exports from Argentina, the second-largest shipper,
plunged 46 percent that year from the previous season, and
Brazil’s shipments slumped 8.9 percent, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data. The two nations are likely to
represent 24 percent of global corn exports in 2010-2011, while
the U.S. will supply 57 percent.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$10.885 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
