Morgan Stanley  and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. had their third-quarter earnings estimates cut by
Deutsche Bank AG, which cited weak trading revenue.  Goldman Sachs ’s earnings-per-share estimate was lowered to
$1.95 from $3 and Morgan Stanley’s was trimmed to 15 cents from
50 cents, analysts led by  Michael Carrier  said in a note to
clients yesterday. The bank has a “buy” recommendation on both
stocks.  Capital markets in the third quarter “were mostly weak
across the board following a challenging second quarter,
including muted equity trading,” the Deutsche Bank analysts
said. “The combination of derisking during the European crises,
ongoing regulatory reform uncertainty and negative macro data
points led investors to stay out of the markets.”  Deutsche Bank said it’s expecting another subdued quarter
at New York-based Goldman Sachs because of poor conditions in
trading and “soft investment banking.” Morgan Stanley, also
based in New York, may post a “weak” quarter because of its
trading results and slowing revenue from investment banking,
asset management and wealth management, the analysts said.  Goldman Sachs fell $1.90, or 1.3 percent, to $149.50 at
12:03 p.m. in New York trading, while Morgan Stanley dropped 59
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $25.47.  To contact the reporters on this story:
