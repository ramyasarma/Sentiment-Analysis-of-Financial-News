Most Kenyans want the  International
Criminal Court  to try suspected instigators of post-election
violence in 2008 that killed as many as 1,500 people, according
to survey by market research company  Synovate .  Fifty-four percent of Kenyans favor the perpetrators
standing trial at the Hague-based ICC, with the remainder almost
split evenly between forgiving the offenders and trying them
locally, the Nairobi-based unit of Synovate said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The poll of 1,501 Kenyans between Sept. 16
and Sept. 20 had a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
Managing Director George Waititu said today in a phone interview
from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.  The clashes were sparked by a disputed December 2007
election, which the opposition said was rigged to return
President  Mwai Kibaki  to office for a second term. The bloodshed
stopped after Kibaki signed a power-sharing deal with his rival,
 Raila Odinga , who became prime minister.  The ICC’s chief prosecutor,  Luis Moreno-Ocampo , announced
yesterday that the court will start prosecutions against as many
as six suspects.  Synovate’s poll indicates the Kenyan public may disagree
with some government officials, such as Justice Minister Mutula
Kilonzo, who argued that provisions in the country’s new
constitution to strengthen local courts means there’s no longer
a need for the ICC’s involvement, Waititu said.  Kibaki signed into law the new constitution on Aug. 27 to
replace one dating to Kenya’s independence from the U.K. in
1963.  To contact the reporter on this story:
