Canada’s dollar fell from a six-
week high against its U.S. counterpart after a government report
showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in July, calling into
question the strength of the economic recovery.  The currency gained earlier today as much as 0.8 percent as
the greenback slid against most of its major counterparts after
the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday in its
statement it “will provide additional accommodation if needed”
to spur growth. The loonie extended its drop as stocks slid,
reducing demand for assets related to economic growth.  “The Canadian data seems to disappoint now on every
release,”  Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange trading in
Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, said via
e-mail. “The Canadian dollar should easily give back all of the
gains post-FOMC and more.”  The Canadian currency depreciated 0.3 percent to C$1.0302
per U.S. dollar at 4:30 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0268
yesterday. It touched C$1.0192, the strongest level since Aug.
6. One Canadian dollar buys 97.07 U.S. cents.  Retail sales unexpectedly decreased 0.1 percent to C$35.9
billion ($35.1 billion) in July as consumers cut purchases of
furniture, appliances and electronics, Statistics Canada
reported. The median forecast of 15 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.6 percent gain. Statistics Canada
reported yesterday that consumer prices unexpectedly fell 0.1
percent in August.  The loonie was the worst performer today among the
greenback’s major counterparts. Home prices in the U.S.,
Canada’s largest trading partner, dropped 3.3 percent in July
from a year earlier.  Canadian Bonds  Government bond yields dropped for a second day, tracking
U.S. rates. The  10-year  bond yield fell 7 basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.84 percent. It touched 2.83 percent, the
lowest level in two weeks. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 increased 58 cents to C$105.57.  The yield  advantage  of Canada’s 10-year bonds over
equivalent-maturity U.S. Treasuries widened yesterday by 9 basis
points, the most since Aug. 13, 2009, after the Fed’s statement.
The gap narrowed to 32 basis points today from 34 yesterday.  Stocks fluctuated, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
down 0.5 percent. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 0.2
percent and the  MSCI World Index , a gauge of equities in 24
developed nations, was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
