Three-time major tournament winner
 Ernie Els  will head a list of five inductees into the  World Golf
Hall of Fame  in May.  Along with Els, 1957 Masters Tournament winner Doug Ford,
the late Jock Hutchison and former President  George H.W. Bush 
also were selected for induction into the facility in St.
Augustine, Florida. A fifth inductee will be announced in
October.  Els, who was on the PGA Tour Ballot for the first time,
received 66 percent of the vote. The 40-year-old South African
won 1994 and 1997 U.S. Open titles and the 2002 British Open
championship, and has 59 other worldwide victories.  A PGA Tour player must be at least 40 to be elected to the
hall, which means this was Els’s first year of eligibility.  Ford, 88, elected in the Veterans Category along with
Hutchison, also captured the 1955 PGA Championship among his 19
PGA Tour victories. He was named Player of the Year in 1955 and
competed in four Ryder Cup competitions for the U.S.  Hutchison, who died in 1977 at the age of 93, won the PGA
Championship in 1920 and the British Open in 1921. A native of
Scotland, he became a U.S. citizen in 1920.  Bush, 86, selected in the Lifetime Achievement Category, is
a recipient of the 1997 PGA of America Distinguished Service
Award, the USGA’s 2008 Bob Jones Award and the 2009 PGA Tour
Lifetime Achievement Award. He also served as honorary chairman
of the 1996 Presidents Cup matches.  The 2011 inductions will be held May 9, the week of the PGA
Tour’s Players Championship, golf’s richest event, at the  TPC at
Sawgrass  in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. The course is about 25
miles from the Hall of Fame.  Other players on the 2011 ballot not selected for induction
include  Retief Goosen  of South Africa,  Colin Montgomerie  of
Scotland and Americans  Fred Couples ,  Davis Love III ,  Kenny Perry 
and  Jay Haas .  Election to the hall requires 65 percent of returned
ballots from the PGA Tour Voting Body that consists of golf
journalists, historians and golf dignitaries, according to the
World Golf Hall of Fame’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
