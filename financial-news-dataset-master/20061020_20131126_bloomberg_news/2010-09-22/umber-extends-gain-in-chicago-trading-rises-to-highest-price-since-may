Lumber extended gains in Chicago
trading, rising to the highest price since May 25.  Lumber futures for November delivery climbed as much as
$9.60, or 4.1 percent, to $241.60 for 1,000 board feet on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices yesterday rose the maximum
$10 daily limit as a jump in U.S. housing starts revived
prospects for constructive materials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
