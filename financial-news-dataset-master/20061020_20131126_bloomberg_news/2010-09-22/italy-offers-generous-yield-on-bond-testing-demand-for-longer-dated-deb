Italy offered investors a
“generous” relative yield to sell 6 billion euros ($8 billion)
of 15-year bonds as it becomes the latest peripheral European
nation to issue debt.  “Italy’s sale is very important given it will be the
biggest indicator of sentiment for long-dated bonds from the
euro zone since Spain sold 10-year debt in July,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , a fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA in
Paris. “The spread Italy is offering is sufficiently generous
to attract very strong demand.”  The bonds, due March 2026, were marketed at 10 basis points
more than Italy’s March 2025 notes, according to a person with
knowledge of the sale, equivalent to a yield of about 4.5
percent. The government received orders of more than 10 billion
euros for the notes, said the person, who declined to be
identified before the transaction is completed.  Italy’s first euro fixed-rate bond issue via a group of
banks since September 2009 follows auctions of shorter-dated
notes from Ireland, Greece and Spain yesterday and Portugal
today. The deal comes after the Rome government approved 25
billion euros of spending cuts in July to trim the budget
deficit after Greece’s near-default led investors to shirk bonds
from Europe’s most indebted nations.  Debt Auctions  More recently, Italy added 2.4 billion euros to its March
2025 securities in an Aug. 8 auction with the notes priced at an
average yield of 4.36 percent.  Portugal auctioned 750 million euros of bonds today. It
issued 450 million euros of securities due October 2014 at an
average yield of 4.695 percent, compared with an average 3.621
percent at a previous auction on July 28. The 300 million euros
of June 2020 bonds were issued at an average yield of 6.242
percent, compared with 5.312 percent at an Aug. 25 sale. The
nation initially sought to raise 1 billion euros from the debt
sale.  “We saw respite in concern over sovereign debt in the euro
zone yesterday,” said Orlando Green, assistant director of
capital markets strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “Sustainability is now the
question.”  Credit-default swaps insuring Italian government debt rose
6 basis points to 197.2 according to data provider CMA,
signaling a deterioration in investor perceptions of the
nation’s credit quality.  Default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt for five years is
equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Italy is rated Aa2, the third-highest investment grade
rating, by Moody’s and one step lower at AA- by Standard &
Poor’s.  Banca IMI SpA, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., Deutsche
Bank AG, Nomura Bank International Plc and Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc are managing the new benchmark issue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
