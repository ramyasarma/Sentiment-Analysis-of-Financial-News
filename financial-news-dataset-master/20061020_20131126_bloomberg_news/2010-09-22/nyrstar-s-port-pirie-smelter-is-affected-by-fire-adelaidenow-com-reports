Nyrstar NV’s Port Pirie silver-
processing plant was affected by a fire today that was caused by
a nitric-acid spill, Adelaidenow.com reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The blaze at the smelter, which broke out 3:50 p.m. local
time, was put out after an hour, the news service reported.
Workers escaped injury, the report said.  An after office-hours telephone call by Bloomberg News to
Nyrstar’s Port Pirie office wasn’t answered.  Port Pirie, which has a smelter and refinery, produces lead,
silver, zinc, copper and gold, according to the company’s
 website . The site, about 200 kilometers (127 miles) north of
Adelaide in South Australia state, can produce about 235,000
metric tons of refined lead and lead alloys, 16 million ounces
of refined silver and about 45,000 tons of zinc, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
