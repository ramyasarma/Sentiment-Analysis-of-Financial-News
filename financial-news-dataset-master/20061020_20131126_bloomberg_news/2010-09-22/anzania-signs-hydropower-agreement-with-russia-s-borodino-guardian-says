Tanzania has signed a contract with
Russia’s  Borodino Group  to build a 222-megawatt hydropower
plant, the  Guardian  reported, citing David Jairo, permanent
secretary to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals.  The Rumakali project will be built in Tanzania’s  Iringa 
region, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of the commercial
capital, Dar es Salaam, at a cost of about $700 million, the
newspaper said.  The project will generate enough electricity to meet almost
a quarter of Tanzania’s daily demand, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
