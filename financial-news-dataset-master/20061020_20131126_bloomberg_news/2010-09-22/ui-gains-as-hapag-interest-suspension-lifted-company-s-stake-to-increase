TUI AG,  the biggest single
stakeholder in Hapag-Lloyd AG, gained the most in three weeks in
Frankfurt trading after saying a suspension of interest payments
from the container line will be lifted.  The shares rose as much as 4.8 percent, the  steepest 
intraday advance since Sept. 1.  TUI said today it expects to receive about 65 million euros
($86 million) of interest payments, which were halted after
Hapag asked for state guarantees amid last year’s economic
crisis. Germany’s biggest container line plans to relinquish the
guarantees after completing refinancing transactions.  Hapag has become profitable again this year after freight
rates and volumes increased. A Hamburg-based group, including
German billionaire  Klaus Michael Kuehne , M.M. Warburg & Co., HSH
Nordbank AG and Hamburg’s government, bought a majority stake
last year. TUI still owns about 43 percent.  TUI, based in Hanover, Germany, has repeatedly said it
wants to dispose of its stake in Hapag to increase its focus on
tourism. The company has so far been unable to find a buyer.  Hapag’s refinancing means TUI’s stake will increase to 49.8
percent by the end of December at the latest, TUI said today.
The increase is the result of the conversion of a hybrid loan
for Hapag into equity, according to a statement.  TUI  shares  were up 13 cents, or 1.5 percent, at 8.56 euros
as of 10:24 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
