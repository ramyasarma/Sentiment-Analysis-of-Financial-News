Gold, little changed, may gain
after climbing to a record yesterday as the Federal Reserve said
it was willing to ease monetary policy further to boost the U.S.
economy, sending the dollar to a six-week low.  Bullion for immediate delivery advanced as much as 0.2
percent to $1,289.88 an ounce before trading at $1,287.80 at
11:36 a.m. Melbourne time. The metal reached $1,291 yesterday.
Gold for December delivery gained as much as 1.3 percent to
$1,290.90, nearing yesterday’s all-time high of $1,292.40.  “It continues to look bullish,”  Peter McGuire , managing
director at CWA Global Markets Pty, said by phone from Sydney
today. “There are more worries about debasing of currencies,
printing of money and quantitative easing.”  The Fed will continue to monitor the economic outlook and
is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time,
to levels consistent with its mandate,” the Federal Open Market
Committee said yesterday in a statement in Washington.  The U.S. currency continued its decline today to the lowest
level since Aug. 6. The dollar traded at $1.3287 per euro as of
11:38 a.m. in Melbourne.  Gold, which often moves counter to the dollar, has advanced
17 percent this year and is heading for its 10th annual gain.  The metal may rise to between $1,350 to $1,400 before the
end of the year, CWA’s McGuire said. Economic uncertainty in
Europe as well as the U.S. would help support investment-haven
demand, he said.  Unemployment Levels  The National Bureau of Economic Research said Sept. 20 that
the worst U.S. recession since the 1930s ended in June 2009.
Still, unemployment in the U.S. may stay above pre-recession
levels until at least 2013, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said in a report the same day.  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent and purchased mortgage-backed securities
and Treasuries to help bolster the economy.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$20.9559 an ounce after yesterday advancing to $21.075, the
highest level since March 2008.  Platinum climbed 0.4 percent to $1,631.50 an ounce and
palladium gained 0.6 percent to $538.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
