European stocks fell for a second
day, led by declines in shares of Banco Santander SA and Daimler
AG. U.S. stock-index futures also declined, while Asian shares
advanced.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.6 percent to 263.29 at
8:29 a.m. in London, extending yesterday’s 0.5 percent retreat.
Santander, Spain’s largest lender, slipped 1.5 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the stock. Daimler fell 2.1
percent after la Repubblica reported that the company made a 9
billion-euro “pre-offer” for Fiat Industrial SpA.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 0.1 percent after earlier rising as much as 0.5
percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rallied 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
