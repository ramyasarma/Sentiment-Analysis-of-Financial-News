Norway’s krone rose versus the
euro, erasing an earlier loss, as the central bank said the key
interest rate should be increased to a “more normal level.”  The krone gained to the strongest in more than four months
versus the dollar as the central bank said economic activity
among some of Norway’s biggest trading partners including
Germany increased more than expected. The Oslo-based bank kept
the benchmark deposit rate unchanged at 2 percent in line with
all of the 14 economists in a Bloomberg  survey .  “They once again confirmed that they still plan to re-
activate their hiking campaign in the future,” said  Arne Lohmann Rasmussen , head of currency research at Danske Bank A/S
in Copenhagen. “That helped the krone.”  Norway’s krone strengthened 0.2 percent to 7.8918 per euro
as of 3:10 p.m. in Oslo, erasing an earlier weakening to 7.9340.
It traded 1.2 percent stronger at 5.8835 per dollar after
earlier reaching 5.8828, the strongest since May 3.  “The consideration of guarding against the risk of future
financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation
somewhat further ahead nonetheless suggests that the interest
rate should be gradually brought closer to a more normal
level,” the bank’s Executive Board said in a monetary policy
statement posted on its website today.  ‘They want to raise interest rates but they don’t have the
reason for it yet,” said  Carl Hammer , the chief currency
strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm. “The expectations from the
market was also incredible dovish” before the decision.  To contact the reporters on this story:
