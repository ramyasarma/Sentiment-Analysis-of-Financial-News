OAO Gazprom ’s LNG unit will buy 15
cargoes of liquefied natural gas from GDF Suez SA over 2 1/2
years as the world’s biggest gas producer expands beyond
pipeline deliveries.  The agreement covers about 900,000 metric tons of the fuel,
Gazprom Global LNG said today in a joint statement. The first
cargo is planned for “early” 2011.  Gazprom is securing LNG supplies from third parties to
expand global sales of the super-chilled fuel. It started its
own LNG production at the Sakhalin-2 facility last year, selling
the fuel to customers in Japan and South Korea.  “We have experienced tremendous growth of our LNG
portfolio over the last couple of years, particularly in
developing our Asia-Pacific basin activities,”  Frederic Barnaud , managing director of the U.K.-registered Gazprom Global
LNG subsidiary, said in the statement. “This deal further
strengthens our position as a world-class LNG marketer on both
sides of the Suez Canal and active participant in the LNG
shipping market”.  GDF Suez sources LNG from Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, Norway,
Yemen and Trinidad and Tobago for a total of 16.5 million tons a
year of long-term LNG supplies, the statement said.  The Moscow-based company shipped its first LNG to the U.S.
in 2005 after purchasing the cargo from BG Group Plc, a U.K. gas
producer. It also swapped its own pipeline gas for cargoes with
BP Plc. and Gaz de France, as it gained experience in LNG
trading.  LNG is natural gas chilled to a liquid to aid
transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
