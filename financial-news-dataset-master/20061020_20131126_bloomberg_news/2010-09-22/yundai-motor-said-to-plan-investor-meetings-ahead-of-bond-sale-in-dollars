Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest automaker, plans to sell bonds denominated in U.S.
dollars, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. are managing the sale, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the details are private.
Hyundai Capital America will sell the notes and Hyundai Motor
will provide a guarantee, the person said.  Hyundai Motor plans to meet bond investors in the U.S. and
Asia from Sept. 27 to market the benchmark sale, the person said.
Benchmark typically means at least $500 million.  Moody’s Investors Service ranked the new bonds at Baa2, its
second-lowest investment-grade rating, according to a statement.
Standard & Poor’s gave the proposed notes BBB-, its lowest
investment grade.  Hyundai Motor sold bonds in dollars in April, when it
raised $500 million from a sale of 4.5 percent notes due 2015
that were priced to yield 197.5 basis points more than similar
maturity U.S. Treasuries. The notes were last quoted at a spread
of 242 basis points, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Eugene Chung, a spokeswoman at Hyundai Capital, was not
immediately able to comment when called by Bloomberg on her
mobile phone. Today is a public holiday in South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
