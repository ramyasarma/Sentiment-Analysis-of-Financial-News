Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, rose 31.2 percent in the latest week, as
pickings advanced, analyst  Thomas Hartmann  said.  Arrivals were 44,694 bags in the week ended Sept. 19,
according to an e-mailed report from the Salvador, Brazil-based
analyst said in a report dated yesterday. That compares with
34,061 bags he reported a week earlier. Total arrivals from
Brazil rose to 65,122 bags from 56,105 bags a week earlier. A
bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia represents at least 70 percent of the country’s
output, Hartmann said Sept. 2.  Cocoa for December delivery gained as much as 3 percent to
$2,796 a metric ton in New York yesterday, before closing at
$2,779. The most-active contract has lost 16 percent this year.  Hartmann is a board member of the Commercial Association of
Bahia in charge of the group’s statistical service on Brazilian
cocoa output, according to the Sept. 2 e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
