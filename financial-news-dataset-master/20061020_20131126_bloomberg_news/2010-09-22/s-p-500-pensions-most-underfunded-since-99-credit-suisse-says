U.S. corporate pensions face their
biggest funding shortfalls since at least 1999, forcing
companies to use profits and cash stockpiles to pay retirees
instead of investing in their businesses, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG.  Defined-benefit pension plans at companies in the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  are probably 75 percent funded, below the
previous trough of 78 percent in 2008, leaving a total $402
billion in shortfalls, analysts  David Zion  and Amit Varshney
estimated. Pension costs may keep rising next year, threatening
 earnings  at 265 companies including  Boeing Co.,  they said.  “Earnings estimates may have to come down,” the analysts
wrote in a note dated Sept. 21. “Unless we see a spike in
yields on high-grade bonds or a stock-market rally in the fourth
quarter, it looks like the health of most pension plans will
deteriorate this year,” and “pension contributions could
become more of an ongoing drain on cash which may not be
reflected in the market’s expectations.”  Corporate pensions have suffered after the S&P 500 posted
its first negative total return over any decade and the Federal
Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low in
December 2008.  S&P 500  companies’ pension funding levels may have dropped
$134 billion this year as bets on higher interest rates went
awry and the stock market weakened, the analysts said. The
benchmark for U.S. equities is up 1.7 percent this year while
the  yield  on the two-year Treasury note touched a record low.
The S&P 500 posted an average decrease of 0.9 percent a year
from 1999 to 2009, including dividends, the first negative
return for a decade since data began in 1927, according to S&P
analyst  Howard Silverblatt .  Pension Obligations  Pension costs for S&P 500 companies will increase to $53
billion in 2011 from $40 billion this year, Zion and Varshney
forecast. As a result, 95 companies could have their earnings
cut by at least 5 cents a share next year, assuming a 35 percent
tax rate. Boeing, the world’s second-biggest commercial-jet
builder, may see a reduction of 12 percent, or 57 cents a share,
from the average analyst estimate, Credit Suisse said.  Other S&P 500 companies where 2011 earnings could fall more
than 10 percent from analyst estimates because of pension
obligations, according to Credit Suisse’s projections, are
Vulcan Materials Co., Marsh & McLennan Cos., New York Times Co.,
Northeast Utilities, Honeywell International Inc. and Deere &
Co.  “Higher pension costs could be one reason why 2011
earnings estimates may have to come down and we would expect
some companies to start taking down their 2011 guidance when
they announce third-quarter earnings,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story;
