Sonda SA  climbed the most in more
than nine months in Santiago trading after Banchile Inversiones
raised its share price estimate and reiterated a “buy” rating,
citing accelerating earnings and expansion plans.  Sonda climbed 3.8 percent to a record 1,004.8 pesos at 3:59
p.m. New York time, the steepest advance since Dec. 10, 2009.
Chile’s  IPSA index  fell 1 percent to 4,772.29.  Latin America’s second-largest information technology
company by market value probably will reach 1,250 pesos next
year, analysts  Andres Alamos  and  Felipe Mercado  wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. They previously forecast 900 pesos by
the end of this year. Sales and earnings before items are set to
increase 25 percent and 28 percent, respectively, next year
after acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, they wrote.  “We estimate that more than 55 percent of consolidated
sales in 2011 will come from foreign operations,” the analysts
wrote. Sonda probably will invest $167 million in further
acquisitions during the next two years, they said.  Sonda has risen 34 percent in the last year compared with
Ipsa index’s 45 percent rally. The stock is trading at a 12
percent discount to its two-year average on an earnings-before-
items basis, the Banchile analysts said.  “This is not justified considering the company’s growth
prospects and supports our ‘buy’ recommendation,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
