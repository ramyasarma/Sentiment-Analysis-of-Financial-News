Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to its highest level in almost five months,
while the region’s currencies strengthened against the dollar.
Treasuries rose and gold reached a record after the Federal
Reserve signaled it will increase purchases of U.S. debt.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.5 percent to 125.54 as
of 4 p.m. in Tokyo, set to close at the highest level since
April 30. The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed at 264.69.
Standard & Poor’s 500 futures rose 0.4 percent. The dollar
weakened to 84.87 yen from 85.09 yesterday and the ringgit rose
to a 13-year high. Two-year Treasuries yielded 0.4155 percent,
matching the record low set yesterday. German and Irish
government bonds opened higher. Gold for immediate delivery
advanced as much as 0.3 percent to a $1,291.05 an ounce.  Investors gained confidence that the global economy will
continue to recover after the Federal Reserve said it’s willing
to ease monetary policy further to spur growth. Malaysia’s
 economy  may expand more than 6 percent this year, Prime Minister
 Najib Razak  said yesterday.  “Clearly, the Fed is leading toward further monetary
easing,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP
Australia Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest interdealer broker.  Shares of drug makers and Japanese land developers
increased. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent.
Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.5 percent. Markets in
China, South Korea and Taiwan are closed for holidays.  CSL Ltd. , the world’s No. 2 maker of treatments derived
from blood, climbed 3.4 percent on speculation it will benefit
from the recall of a competitor’s product.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. ,
Japan’s largest developer by sales, gained 1.7 percent after
declines in the country’s land prices slowed.  Panasonic Corp. 
jumped 2.4 percent in Tokyo after the Nikkei English News said
the company won’t issue new shares to fund buyouts.  Balance  “Equity markets are trying to strike the right balance
between the willingness of the Fed to do more, where uncertainty
is declining, and its ability to deliver good outcomes, which is
challenged by declining policy effectiveness,”  Mohamed A. El- Erian , chief executive at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which runs the world’s biggest bond fund, wrote in an e-mail.  The dollar fell to its lowest level in six weeks against
the euro, dropping to $1.3326 per euro from $1.3264 yesterday in
New York. The euro traded at 113.15 yen from 112.87 yen
yesterday. The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.0905 per
dollar, contributing to this year’s 11 percent advance. The
currency is now at the strongest level since October 1997.  Aussie High  Australia’s dollar rallied to a two-year high as prospects
for additional easing by the Federal Reserve increased demand
for the South Pacific nation’s higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie traded at 95.72 U.S. cents, the most
since July 2008, from 95.52 cents in New York. It was at 81.24
yen from 81.27 yen yesterday. The difference between 10-year
yields in  Australia  and the U.S. widened to 257 basis points
yesterday, the most since July 2008.  “A clear difference in monetary policy stance between
Australia and the U.S. should give an important catalyst for
Aussie,” said  Kumiko Gervaise , a foreign-exchange analyst in
Tokyo at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a unit of Japan’s
largest online currency margin trading company.  While the Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate
unchanged yesterday and refrained from expanding its holdings of
securities, it didn’t rule out easing monetary policy.  “The committee will continue to monitor the economic
outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide
additional accommodation if needed to support the economic
recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels
consistent with its mandate,” the Federal Open Market Committee
said yesterday in a statement in Washington.  Treasuries Purchase  The central bank is scheduled to buy Treasuries due from
March 2013 to August 2014 today as part of its effort to keep
borrowing costs low.  “They are below their targets on both economic growth and
inflation,” said  Yusuke Tanaka , senior dealer for Mitsubishi
UFJ Trust & Banking Corp. in Singapore, part of Japan’s largest
publicly traded lender. “Yields will gradually fall.”  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped two basis
points to 2.56 percent in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The price of the 2.625 percent security due in August 2020
gained 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 18/32. The
yield on the 10-year German bund fell 6 basis points to 2.39
percent. Irish 10-year yields fell 3 basis points to 6.36
percent. The yield spread between Irish and German government
bonds widened 1 basis point to 384 basis points.  Spot gold extended a rally after the Federal Reserve
statement. Base metals including copper, zinc, nickel and lead
advanced on increased investment demand as the dollar dropped.  To contact the reporters for this story:
