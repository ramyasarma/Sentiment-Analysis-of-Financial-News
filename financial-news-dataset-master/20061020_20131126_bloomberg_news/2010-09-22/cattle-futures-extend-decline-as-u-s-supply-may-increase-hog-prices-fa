(Corrects today’s low price in fifth paragraph.)  Cattle futures fell the most in two
weeks on concern that supplies available to U.S. beef processors
will increase. Feeder cattle dropped to the lowest price since
June, and hogs declined.  Cattle purchases by U.S. feedlots jumped 7.1 percent last
month from a year earlier, adding 2.27 million head to herds,
the most of any August since 2006, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said Sept. 17. Cattle prices in Chicago have fallen
every day since the report, dropping 3.6 percent.  “That’s where the aftershock is coming,” from the
unexpected feedlot expansion reported by USDA, said  Paul Beere ,
a market adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 1.75 cents, or
1.7 percent, to 98.3 cents a pound at 11:07 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A close at that price would be the biggest
decline since Sept. 7. Earlier, cattle slid to 98.125 cents, the
lowest price for a most-active contract since Sept. 9. Before
today, futures jumped 16 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement dropped 1.575
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.0945 a pound on the CME, and
reached $1.09275, the lowest level for a most-active contract
since June 10. Before today, the commodity gained 15 percent
this year.  “Feeders are in a tough spot,” said  Dennis Smith , a
senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. The rising corn prices are “a major factor against the
feeder market” and are pressuring prices, he said.  Before today, corn futures climbed 22 percent this year,
touching $5.2375 a bushel on Sept. 20, the highest level for a
most-active contract since Sept. 30, 2008.  Hogs Decline  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.65 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 76.425 cents a pound in Chicago.  Wholesale pork  fell 0.5 percent yesterday to 91.43 cents a
pound, USDA data show. Before today, hog futures climbed 17
percent this year and pork prices soared 36 percent.  “I’m expecting some more weakness” from pork prices
“that will eventually translate into weakness in the cash-hog
market,” Smith said. “I’m expecting a defensive trade as far
as the hog-futures markets go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
