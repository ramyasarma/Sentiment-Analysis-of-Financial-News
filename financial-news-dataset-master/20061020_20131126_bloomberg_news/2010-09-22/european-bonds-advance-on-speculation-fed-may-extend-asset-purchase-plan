European bonds climbed, sending the
10-year bund yield down the most in a month, as speculation that
slower growth in the U.S. will damp the global economic recovery
boosted demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  The advance drove the German 30-year  yield  to less than 3
percent for the first time in a week. The U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee said yesterday too-slow inflation and sluggish
growth may warrant another wave of so-called quantitative
easing. Portuguese bonds rose more than German securities,
narrowing the yield premium over bunds, after the nation sold
750 million euros ($1 billion) of debt due in 2014 and 2020.  “If the economy is going to be fragile and more
quantitative easing is needed, this would be bad for Germany,
which is export orientated,” said  Glenn Marci , a fixed-income
strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “There’s also a bit of a
flight to quality on the fear that those countries with high
deficits and high debt might have more problems in a slowdown.”  The bund yield fell as much as 12 basis points to 2.34
percent, the biggest decline since Aug. 24, as of 5:10 p.m. in
London. The 2.25 percent security maturing in September 2020
advanced 0.92, or 9.20 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
99.16.  The 30-year yield slid 8 basis points to 2.97 percent.  The FOMC said in its statement that it’s “prepared to
provide additional accommodation if needed to support the
economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels
consistent with its mandate.” That positions the Fed for
expanding a near-record $2.3 trillion balance sheet, adding to
pressure on government-bond yields.  Data today showed European industrial orders declined in
July more than economists estimated, dropping 2.4 percent from
June. A Bloomberg survey had predicted a drop 1.4 percent.  French Bonds  France’s 10-year bond yielded 2.71 percent, down 10 basis
points. The U.K. 10-year gilt yield fell 14 basis points to 2.98
percent after the Bank of England signaled today that it’s
moving closer to more asset purchases. The U.K. yield premium to
bunds fell 4 basis points to 63 basis points, the least since
January.  Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields fell 5 basis points to 2.52
percent after dropping 14 basis points yesterday. The difference
in yield, or  spread  between German and U.S. 10-year debt was at
18 basis points, from 24 basis points on Sept. 20.  Portuguese 10-year bonds rose after the nation’s auction
raised the minimum amount from an intended range of 750 million
euros to 1 billion euros. The gain sent the yield down 15 basis
points to 6.19 percent. The yield  premium  investors demand to
hold the securities instead of bunds dropped 7 basis points to
378 basis points. The Irish 10-year yield spread to bunds
increased 11 basis points to 394 basis points.  No Difficulty  Portugal’s budget gap widened in the first eight months of
the year, the Finance Ministry said two days ago. The nation has
carried out 91 percent of its planned bond issuance, according
to government debt agency IGCP.  “The auction seems to have been taken down without too
much difficulty after the wider spreads provided an
opportunity,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh
at RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and money
managers. “It’s slightly disappointing they didn’t manage” to
sell the maximum intended amount of 1 billion euros, he said.
“Until we see an improvement in the fiscal position, it’s
difficult to see the spread narrowing significantly.”  The cost of insuring against losses on European sovereign
bonds rose. Credit-default swaps on Ireland surged 24 basis
points to 464, while contracts on Portugal jumped 17 to 390, the
highest since May, according to data provider CMA. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index increased 3 basis points to 160
basis points.  Germany sold 4.72 billion euros of five-year notes today.
Italy is selling 15-year bonds via banks that will be priced at
10 basis points more than Italy’s March 2025 notes, according to
a person with knowledge of the sale, equivalent to a yield of
about 4.5 percent. The government received orders of about 10
billion euros for the notes, said the person, who declined to be
identified before the transaction is completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
