Japanese  stocks  fell for a second
consecutive day, led by makers of cars and electronics on
concern their export earnings will drop as the yen strengthened
to its highest level in a week against the dollar.  Honda Motor Co. , an automaker that gets almost 85 percent
of its revenue abroad, and Nissan Motor Co., which earns more
than a third of its sales from North America, lost at least 1.5
percent. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, and Sony
Corp., a maker of electronics that gets more than 70 percent of
its revenue overseas, both sank more than 1 percent.  “Investors are worried about the yen’s strengthening,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion as
chief strategist at Tokyo-based Toyota Asset Management Co.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.4 percent to 9,566.32
at the close in Tokyo, after swinging between an increase of 0.2
percent and a drop of 0.6 percent. The broader Topix index slid
0.4 percent to 846.52, with about three shares declining for
every two that advanced.  The Nikkei 225 crossed between gains and losses more than
30 times today as the yen strengthened and weakened. The  number 
of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was the lowest in
more than a week ahead of a public holiday tomorrow.  “There’s no direction in the market,” said Toyota Asset’s
Hamasaki. “Trading is getting thinner ahead of the holiday.”  The Nikkei 225 has fallen 9.3 percent this year, the
second-biggest drop among benchmark indexes for the world’s 10-
largest stock markets. That has cut the average price of stocks
in the gauge to 16.6 times  estimated earnings , near the lowest
level since December 2008.  Europe, Asia, U.S.  Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property prices
and concern about the pace of U.S. economic growth have hurt
confidence in a global recovery.  Stocks have also fallen as the yen strengthened to a 15-
year high against the dollar on Sept. 15, cutting the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Canon , which gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad,
lost 1.2 percent to 3,860 yen, and Sony, the maker of Cyber-shot
cameras and Vaio computers, slid 1.9 percent to 2,588 yen. Fanuc
Ltd., a maker of industrial robots that earns about 80 percent
of revenue overseas, fell 0.7 percent to 10,520 yen. Electronics
companies were the  biggest drag  on the Topix among its 33
industry groups, followed by automakers.  Toyota Motor Corp., which is the world’s largest carmaker
and gets about 70 percent of its revenue abroad, lost 1 percent
to 3,040 yen. Honda, Japan’s second-largest automaker, fell 1.6
percent to 2,953 yen. They were the  heaviest  individual drags on
the Topix. Nissan slid 1.5 percent to 702 yen.  Yen Hurts Exporters  The yen appreciated to as much as 84.78 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, the highest level since Japan’s government said
Sept. 15 that it intervened in the foreign-exchange market for
the first time since 2004 to weaken the currency. The yen
climbed to 82.88 that day, the highest level since 1995. It
traded at 85.57 at the close of Tokyo stock trading yesterday.  “Investors are focused on the future of the currency
market,”  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in
assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  The yen is headed for its strongest annual average level
since currencies began trading freely in 1971, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s close.  Developers Gain  Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s biggest property developer by
sales, gained 1.7 percent to 1,411 yen and Mitsubishi Estate Co.,
the largest by market value, advanced 1.4 percent to 1,339 yen.
Sumitomo Realty & Development Co., rose 1.7 percent to 1,721 yen.
Real-estate companies  gained  the most among the Topix’s groups.  The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
said in a  report  yesterday that average land prices slowed their
decline, dropping 3.7 percent in the 12 months ended June,
compared with a 4.4 percent slump a year earlier. Prices have
fallen for 19 straight years.  Panasonic Corp., the world’s largest maker of plasma
televisions, climbed 2.4 percent to 1,138 yen, the  largest gain 
in the Nikkei 225 and the biggest support for the Topix. The
electronics maker won’t sell new shares to fund its buyouts of
Sanyo Electric Co. and Panasonic Electric Works Co., the Nikkei
newspaper said, without mentioning where it got the information.  To contact the reporter for this story:
