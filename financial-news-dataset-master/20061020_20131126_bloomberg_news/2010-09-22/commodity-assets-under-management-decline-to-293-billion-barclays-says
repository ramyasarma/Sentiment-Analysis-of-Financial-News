Commodity assets under management
fell by $7 billion from a record last month on renewed investor
concern that economic growth may slow, curbing demand for raw
materials, Barclays Capital said.  Assets fell to $293 billion, the first drop since January,
London-based analyst  Amrita Sen  wrote in a report e-mailed
today. Investors withdrew $5 billion from commodity index swaps,
the first monthly decline in at least five years, Sen said.  “There was concern about the U.S. and concern about China
that spooked the market,” Sen said. “In times like that, you
probably want to go toward more active management rather than
passive management” in indexes, she said.  Investors have become more positive on commodities this
month, with managed money bets on higher U.S. commodity futures
at an all-time high, Barclays said. “This better environment is
likely to encourage fresh inflows to commodity investments this
month,” Barclays said.  The  S&P GSCI Total Return Index  of 24 commodities has
climbed 5.2 percent this month, after declining 5.5 percent in
August. Housing, manufacturing and jobs figures this month have
signaled improving economies in the U.S. and China.  Exchange-traded products and medium-term notes had inflows
of $1.5 billion and $652 million in August, respectively,
Barclays said. Precious metals had inflows of $874 million over
the month while energy outflows equaled $1.7 billion, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
