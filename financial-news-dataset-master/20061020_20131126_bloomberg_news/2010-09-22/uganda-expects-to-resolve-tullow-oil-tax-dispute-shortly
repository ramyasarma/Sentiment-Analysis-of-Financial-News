The Ugandan government expects
to resolve a tax dispute that’s held up  Tullow Oil Plc’s 
plans to start producing the country’s first crude, Finance
Minister Syda Bbumba said.  “We are talking and even last week we had talks with
Tullow and its partners,” Bbumba told reporters today in
the capital city of Kampala. “The issue will be resolved
soon.”  Uganda has delayed final approval on Tullow’s $1.5
billion purchase of  Heritage Oil Plc’s  stakes in two
Ugandan blocks. The government says it is owned $404
million in capital gains tax from the transaction.  “It is incumbent for Tullow to bring them back to pay
the taxes,” Lawrence Kizza, director of economic affairs
at the Finance Ministry, said today in an interview,
referring to Heritage.  Until the government approves the deal, Tullow will
be unable to bring in China National Offshore Oil Corp. and
 Total SA  as partners. It needs help to develop the Lake
Albert basin, which may pump more than 200,000 barrels of
oil a day in 2014 or 2015. The explorer increased its
estimate for discovered resources in Uganda to 1 billion
barrels of oil from an earlier forecast of 800 million
barrels.  Uganda is set to become an oil producer when London-
based  Tullow  begins production at the Kasamene field next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
