Siemens AG plans to offer its
employees in Germany unlimited protection from firings,  Die Welt 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The company’s board, works council and the IG Metall union
will sign an agreement today that gives the works council the
right to veto firings, according to the report. That would make
it practically impossible to fire any of the 128,000 employees
in Germany, the newspaper said.  Siemens concluded a similar agreement in 2008 that had a
duration of two years, Die Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
