German bonds may underperform
Treasuries, narrowing the difference in 10-year yields, after
the Federal Reserve said it may provide more stimulus while
European economic data curbs demand for bunds, WestLB AG said.  “We expect the Fed’s more dovish tone to open the way to
renewed tightening in the spread over the next few days at
least, as the euro zone PMIs and Ifo survey fail to prove bund
friendly,”  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG
in London, wrote today in an investor note. Should a sale of
Portuguese debt today go “as smoothly” as auctions by Ireland,
Greece and Spain yesterday, “this would also act to limit the
downside for bund yields,” he said.  German bunds rose, sending the yield down 7 basis points to
2.38 percent as of 8:01 a.m. in London. The  yield premium 
investors demand to hold 10-year Treasuries instead of the
German securities was at 18 basis points, from 31 basis points
at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
