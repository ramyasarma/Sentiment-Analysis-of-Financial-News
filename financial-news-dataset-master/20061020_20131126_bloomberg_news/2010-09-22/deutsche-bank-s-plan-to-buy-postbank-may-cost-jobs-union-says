Deutsche Bank AG ’s plan to buy
retail lender  Deutsche Postbank AG  may result in job cuts and
pose risks to the financial system and the economy, according to
Germany’s Ver.di labor union.  Deutsche Bank should rule out firings and give job and
location guarantees, the union said in an e-mailed statement
today. The merger also “irresponsibly boosts systemic risk,”
Ver.di official  Uwe Foullong  was cited as saying.  Germany’s largest bank this month announced plans to raise
about 10.2 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in Europe’s biggest
rights offer this year to acquire Postbank and boost reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
