Poland expects to complete as many
as three more sales of Assigned Amount Units, its emission
rights under the Kyoto Protocol, by the end of the year,
according to the environment minister.  “I hope we finish the year with the target of 150 million
euros,” Minister Andrzej Kraszewski said in an interview today
in Warsaw. “One transaction is very close to completion, and
overall, about three should be completed by the end of the
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
