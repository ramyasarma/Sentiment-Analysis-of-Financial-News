Treasury 10-year yields will
decline to an all-time low of 1.75 percent by year-end, said
 Hideo Shimomura , chief fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co.  Yields will fall as the Federal Reserve increases its
purchases of U.S. debt later in 2010 to sustain the economic
expansion, Shimomura said. The central bank will announce the
plan at its next policy meeting on Nov. 2 to Nov. 3, he said.
Officials said yesterday they are willing to ease monetary
policy further to spur growth.  “They will buy long-term bonds,” said Shimomura, who
oversees the equivalent of $58.9 billion at the unit of
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest publicly
traded bank. “It will send yields to record lows.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., RBC Capital Markets Corp. and
ICAP Plc are among the companies that said the Fed is signaling
it is preparing to increase its bond purchases. The purchases
may total $1 trillion, Goldman Sachs, one of the 18 primary
dealers that trade directly with the central bank, said in a
note to clients.  The benchmark 10-year note yielded 2.54 percent as of 11:40
a.m. in Tokyo, down from this year’s high of 4.01 percent set on
April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield dropped to a record  low  2.04 percent on Dec. 18,
2008, as a global financial crisis that led to $1.81 trillion of
losses and writedowns at banks and financial companies increased
investor demand for the relative safety of U.S. debt.  Mitsubishi UFJ Asset  last bought 10-year notes at a yield
of 2.80 percent, Shimomura said. The duration of its holdings is
more than the benchmark it uses to gauge performance, he said.
Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s sensitivity to yield
changes and a larger figure indicates a more bullish position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
