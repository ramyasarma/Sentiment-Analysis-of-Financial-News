Demand at an auction of 750-
million euros ($1 billion) of Portuguese bonds maturing in 2014
and 2020 was “strong” as yields rose on the securities,
UniCredit SpA said.  “The auction registered a robust demand,” Chiara
Cremonesi, a strategist at the bank in London, said today in an
e-mailed note. “Despite strong demand at the auction, Portugal
issued the minimum of the range announced. This is likely due to
the increased cost of funding. Portugal is well advanced in the
progress of funding, having completed year-to-date 88 percent of
the bond issuance target for this year and with only 2.5 billion
euros more to issue till year-end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
