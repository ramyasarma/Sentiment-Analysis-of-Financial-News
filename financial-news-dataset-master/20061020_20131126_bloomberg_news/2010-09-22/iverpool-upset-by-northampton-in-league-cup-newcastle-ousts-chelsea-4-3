Liverpool was ousted from English
soccer’s League Cup by fourth-tier Northampton as Chelsea and
Manchester City lost to Premier League rivals.  Northampton, which is ranked 85th of England’s 92
professional clubs, produced the third round’s biggest upset
last night by beating Liverpool 4-2 on penalty kicks after their
match at Anfield finished 2-2 following extra time.  Chelsea was beaten 4-3 at home by Newcastle, which
recovered after Patrick van Aanholt put the Premier League
leader ahead in the sixth minute.  Shola Ameobi  headed the winner
in injury time after  Nicolas Anelka ’s second goal of the game
had tied it at 3-3 with three minutes remaining.  West Brom downed Manchester City 2-1 on goals from Gianni
Zuiverloon and Simon Cox, while  Michael Owen  scored twice as
defending champion Manchester United rallied from a goal down
for a 5-2 win at Championship team Scunthorpe. Darron Gibson,
Chris Smalling and  Park Ji-Sung  got United’s other goals.  Aston Villa gave  Gerard Houllier  a winning start as manager
by beating Blackburn 3-1. Wigan also fought back from a goal
down, scoring twice in the last five minutes to defeat Preston
2-1.  The draw for the fourth round of England’s second-tier cup
competition is scheduled in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
