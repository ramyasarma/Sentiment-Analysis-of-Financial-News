 Toyota Motor Corp., through its
finance arm, sold $1.29 billion of bonds backed by auto loans,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The largest top-rated portion being offered, a $347.1
million slice maturing in 1.9 years, yields 18 basis points more
than the benchmark interest rate, said the person, who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
