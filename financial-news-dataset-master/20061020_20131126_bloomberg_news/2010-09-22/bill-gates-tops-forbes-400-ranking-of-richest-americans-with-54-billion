Bill Gates , the co-founder of
 Microsoft Corp. , remains the richest American with estimated
assets of $54 billion, according to Forbes magazine’s annual
 ranking  of the 400 wealthiest Americans.  Warren Buffett , the chief executive officer of  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. , ranks second in the U.S. with $45 billion,
according to the list published yesterday. Gates, 54, and
Buffett, 80, were Nos. 1 and 2 last year.  The number of list members whose wealth declined this year
is 85 compared with 314 in 2009, while wealth increased for 217
members. The total worth of the 400 rose by 8 percent to $1.37
trillion, still below the 2008 total of $1.57 trillion.  “They’ve recovered, but we’re still so far off from
2008,” Luisa Kroll, global wealth editor for Forbes, said in a
telephone interview.  Facebook Inc. CEO  Mark Zuckerberg , 26, who is tied for No.
35 on the list, saw his wealth jump 245 percent to $6.9 billion,
the largest percentage increase of anyone on the list. “Very
few are at an all-time high, with the exception of how
phenomenally well Facebook is doing,” said Kroll, who is based
in New York.  California has the most people on the list, with 83,
followed by New York, with 64. Texas has 45 members and Florida
has 26.  Moskovitz is Youngest  Sixteen new people joined the list this year, including
 Dustin Moskovitz , a co-founder of Facebook who left the social
networking site in 2008. He has a net worth of $1.4 billion,
tying him for No. 290. Moskovitz, 26, is the youngest person on
the list.  The oldest is philanthropist  David Rockefeller Sr ., 95, who
is tied for No. 153 with $2.4 billion.  Raj Rajaratnam , 53, founder of Galleon Group LLC, who is
under indictment for insider trading and is due to go to trial
next year, dropped off the list along with 33 others. Rajaratnam
has denied the charges.  There are 42 women on the list, led by  Christy Walton , 55,
and 60-year-old  Alice Walton , of the family that controls  Wal-
Mart Stores Inc.  They rank Nos. 4 and 8.  Jim Walton  ranks
seventh with $20.1 billion and  S. Robson Walton  is No. 9 with
$19.7 billion.  New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  is ranked 10th with
$18 billion. Bloomberg, 68, is the founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.  Top 10  The other members in the top 10 are  Oracle Corp.  CEO  Larry Ellison , 66, at No. 3 with $27 billion.  Charles Koch , the 74-
