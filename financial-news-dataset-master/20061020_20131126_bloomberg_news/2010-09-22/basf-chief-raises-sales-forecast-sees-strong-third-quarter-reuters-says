BASF SE , the world’s biggest
chemical maker, expects a jump in sales this year after demand
from China spurred production during the usually slower summer
months, a spokesman said, confirming an earlier report from
Reuters.  Judging by business in July and August, BASF will probably
beat estimates for the third quarter and post a “strong” gain
in full-year sales, Reuters reported, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Hambrecht . Spokesman  Michael Grabicki  confirmed the CEO’s comments.  BASF in July predicted that 2010 revenue would increase
more than the wider chemical industry. Demand for chemical
ingredients that go into products from cars to cosmetics has
bolstered output and enabled the company to increase its prices
this year.  The company, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, will also earn
a “presentable” premium on its cost of capital, pointing to an
increase in this year’s dividend, Reuters cited Hambrecht as
saying.  The stock gained 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 45.46 euros
as of 12:57 p.m. in Frankfurt, while the benchmark DAX Index
fell 0.9 percent.  Second-quarter profit ahead of analyst estimates prompted
BASF in July to forecast that 2010 earnings would rise
“significantly.” Sales will advance by 20 percent to 60.8
billion euros ($81 billion), according to the average of 26
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. Net income may
climb to 3.67 billion euros from 1.41 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
