OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest
lender, bought $300 million of rubles yesterday in a bet the
national currency will strengthen, Kommersant reported, citing
unidentified dealers.  Chief Executive Officer German Gref said two days ago that
expects the ruble to gain against the U.S. currency, the Moscow-
based newspaper said today. Kommersant cited an unidentified
Sberbank official as saying the lender hasn’t conducted any
“major” transactions in the currency market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
