Crude oil declined for a second day
after an Energy Department report showed that U.S. oil and
gasoline inventories unexpectedly increased.  Crude supplies  rose 970,000 barrels to 358.3 million last
week, 13 percent above the five-year average, the department
said today. Inventories were forecast to fall 1.75 million
barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline
stockpiles also climbed.  “Those unexpected builds have taken the wind out of our
sails,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The report reminded us of the
large supply overhang.”  Crude oil for November delivery fell 26 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $74.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the contract’s lowest settlement since Aug. 31. Futures have
gained 4.4 percent in the past year.  Brent crude oil for November settlement declined 47 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to end the session at $77.95 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Gasoline inventories  rose 1.59 million barrels to 226.1
million, the highest level since March, the report showed.
Supplies were forecast to drop 250,000 barrels, according to the
median of 18 analyst estimates.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 347,000 barrels to 174.9
million. The gain left supplies 23 percent higher than the five-
year average for the week. Inventories were forecast to increase
100,000 barrels.  Total Inventories  Total petroleum supplies , including crude oil and fuel,
rose 3.3 million barrels to 1.14 billion last week, the highest
since at least 1990, according to the department.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.82 cents, or 1
percent, to $1.9014 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since Sept. 1. Heating oil for October settlement declined 1.29
cents, or 0.6 percent, to end the session at $2.107 a gallon.  Total consumption  of petroleum products averaged 19.2
million barrels a day last week, down 1.8 percent from the seven
days ending Sept. 10, the report showed.  Crude oil imports  rose 3.3 percent to 9.32 million barrels
a day last week, the report showed.  Fuel imports  increased 11
percent to 2.5 million barrels a day.  Analysts forecast that crude supplies would fall after the
eight-day shutdown of the Enbridge Energy Partners LP 6A
pipeline sending Canadian oil to the U.S. Midwest. Oil surged on
speculation the closure would cause refineries in the Midwest to
divert supply from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery hub for West
Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New York.  Cushing Stockpiles  Cushing supplies  declined 210,000 barrels to 34.7 million.
Crude oil  stockpiles in the Midwest , a region classified by the
Energy Department as PADD 2, slipped 899,000 barrels to 90.8
million.  “The inventory draw in Cushing was no big deal,” said
 Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks and Opinions LLC in
Houston. “It was strange seeing that supplies in PADD 2 had a
small decline. It makes me wonder if they might adjust the
numbers in the future.”  Prices also slipped as equities declined after a drop in
U.S. home prices raised concern that the economic recovery will
falter and as forecasts at technology companies disappointed
investors. Prices dropped 3.3 percent in July from a year
earlier, the eighth consecutive decline, as foreclosed
properties flooded the market, a report from the Federal Housing
Finance Agency in Washington showed.  Equity Declines  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent to
1,134.28 at 4:06 p.m. in New York, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average declined 0.2 percent to 10,739.31.  Oil gained as much as 1.4 percent before the inventory
report as the dollar fell, bolstering investor demand for
commodities.  The Dollar Index , a gauge of the currency versus
six major trading partners, slipped 0.8 percent to 79.81 at 4:11
p.m., the lowest level since March 17. The U.S. currency traded
at $1.3394 per euro, down 1 percent from yesterday.  The greenback dropped after the Federal Reserve said
yesterday for the first time that slowing inflation and sluggish
growth may need more action, positioning it to expand a near-
record $2.3 trillion balance sheet as soon as November.  “The inventory numbers were bigger than expected, but the
dollar is the prime driver right now,” said  Sean Brodrick , a
natural resource analyst with Weiss Research in Jupiter,
Florida. “Once this news is digested, oil will move higher
along with the precious metals.”  Gold futures  for December delivery rose $17.80, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1,292.10 an ounce on the Comex in New
York. The contract touched a record $1,298.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 639,798 contracts as of 4:19
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 679,018 contracts yesterday,
7.1 percent above the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.32 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
