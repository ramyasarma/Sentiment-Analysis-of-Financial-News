The Danes are against joining the
euro-zone by 5 percentage points, the third biggest-margin since
Danske Bank started its poll in 1999, Steen Bocian, chief
economist at the Copenhagen-based bank said in an email today.  The September poll shows that 43.4 percent of respondents
would vote against leaving the krone for the common European
currency, with 8.3 percent also leaning that way. Those favoring
the euro make up 32.2 percent, with a further 14.4 percent
saying they also may vote yes.  “One has to assume that a referendum would result in a
‘no’ if it were held in the near future,” Bocian said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
