(Corrects date that ban was lifted in second paragraph.)  Mexico, the second-largest importer
of U.S. pork, has lifted a ban on the meat from a  Smithfield
Foods Inc.  packing plant in Tarheel, North Carolina, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said.  Shipments from the plant, the world’s largest pork-
processing facility, were eligible for export to Mexico after
Sept. 12, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service said
today in a  statement  on its website. Meat had been restricted
since Aug. 13, the USDA said, without providing a reason for the
ban.  Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. pork.  To contact the reporter on this story:
