French air traffic will be
disrupted by tomorrow’s planned strike over pension reform, the
country’s civil aviation authority said in an e-mailed
statement.  The authority has asked airlines to reduce flights in and
out of Paris’s Orly airport by 50 percent, and those at Roissy-
Charles de Gaulle by 40 percent. Flights to and from other
French airports will also be reduced by 40 percent, according to
the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
