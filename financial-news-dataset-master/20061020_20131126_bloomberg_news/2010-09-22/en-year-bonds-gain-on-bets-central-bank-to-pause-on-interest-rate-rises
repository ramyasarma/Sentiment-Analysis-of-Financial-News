India’s  10-year bonds  advanced for
a third day on speculation the  central bank  will hold off from
raising interest rates to gauge the effect of the five increases
already implemented this year.  Yields fell before a meeting between the finance ministry
and the Reserve Bank of India tomorrow to decide the borrowing
program for the second half of the fiscal year ending March 2011.
The government is scheduled to have completed by the end of
September 63 percent of the record 4.57 trillion rupees ($100
billion) of debt sales planned for the year.  “Investors are coming around to the view that the central
bank will wait for sometime before raising interest rates
again,” said  Sanjay Arya , a treasurer at state-owned Bank of
Maharashtra in Mumbai. “Given the robust revenues the
government may cut the borrowing plan.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 fell two
basis points to 7.94 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price rose
0.15, or 15 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.07.  The Reserve Bank increased the  repurchase rate  to 6 percent
from 5.75 percent and the  reverse repurchase rate  to 5 percent
from 4.5 percent on Sept. 16.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, fell one basis point to 6.38 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
