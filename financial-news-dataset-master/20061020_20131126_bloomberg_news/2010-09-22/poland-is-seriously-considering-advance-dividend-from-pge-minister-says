Polish Treasury Minister Aleksander
Grad said he’s “seriously considering” a payout of an advance
dividend from the audited January-September profit of Polska
Grupa Energetyczna SA.  A payout would end “speculation” that the company known
as PGE won’t pay out a dividend if it buys Energa SA, Grad told
reporters in Warsaw today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
