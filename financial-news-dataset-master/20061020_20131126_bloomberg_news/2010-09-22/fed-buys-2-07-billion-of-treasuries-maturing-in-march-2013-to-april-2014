The Federal Reserve bought $2.07
billion of Treasuries as part of a program to reinvest principal
payments on its mortgage holdings into long-term government debt
to prevent money from being drained out of the financial system.  The Fed acquired 8 of the 28 Treasuries listed for possible
purchase. The securities mature from March 2013 to April 2014,
the New York Fed said in a  statement  today. The Fed has  bought 
$30.172 billion since it began the program on Aug. 17.  The Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday it’s
“prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to
support the economic recovery.” The central bank also retained
its stance from last month of keeping its portfolio of
securities stable at around $2 trillion to keep money from
draining out of the financial system.  Policy makers completed a program to buy $1.25 trillion of
agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of
agency debt in March. The Fed was the biggest buyer of
Treasuries when it purchased $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  The Fed maintains a 35 percent per security limit of the
amount outstanding for each specific Treasury it holds in the
account. The central bank makes the securities available for
loan to dealers against Treasury general collateral on an
overnight basis. Dealers bid in a multiple-price auction held
every day at noon New York time through its securities lending
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
