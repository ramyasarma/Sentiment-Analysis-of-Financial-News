National Australia Bank Ltd.  added
A$1.1 billion ($1.05 billion) to an existing line of April 2013
bonds in its biggest domestic debt sale in almost six months.  The Melbourne-based lender sold A$625 million of floating-
rate notes priced to yield 78 basis points more than the bank
bill swap rate, and A$475 million of 6.25 percent notes priced
to yield 6.085 percent, it said in an e-mailed statement.  National Australia Bank issued A$1.5 billion of debt in
March, when it paid a 77 basis point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It sold $1 billion of securities in the
U.S. on Sept. 20, which yielded 137 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
