CSL Ltd. , the world’s second-
biggest maker of treatments derived from blood, rose the most in
seven months in Sydney trading on speculation it will benefit
from a recall of a competitor’s product in the U.S. and Europe.  CSL  climbed  3.4 percent to close at A$32.80 on the
Australian Securities Exchange, the most since Feb. 17. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration will meet this week to decide
whether to extend a recall of closely held Octapharma AG’s
Octagam 5%, UBS AG said in a note to investors today.  European nations including France and Sweden have
quarantined or withdrawn the product in the past week amid
concern about its safety,  Andrew Goodsall , a Sydney-based
health-care analyst at UBS, wrote. Octagam is an intravenous
immunoglobulin product, or IVIG, used to treat immune
deficiencies and autoimmune diseases.  The FDA said Aug. 20 that Octapharma was voluntarily
 recalling  selected lots of Octagam 5% because of an increase in
the number of reported cases of blood clots, some of which were
serious.  Octapharma controls about 13 percent of the global IVIG
market, according to UBS. A U.S. ban would mean the company’s
competitors, which include Melbourne-based CSL and Deerfield,
Illinois-based  Baxter International Inc.,  would gain “high
single digit growth” in IVIG sales, Goodsall wrote.  CSL is “working with customers in affected markets to help
ensure uninterrupted access to this important medicine,”  Sharon McHale , a CSL spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mailed response to a
request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
