South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  was little changed at 28,722.72 in Johannesburg,
following two days of gains.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  1time Holdings Ltd. (1TM SJ), a low-fare airline, fell to
the lowest in 10 months, dropping 5 cents, or 5 percent, to 95
cents. The company said the outcome of talks with black
investors may affect its share price.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, added 77 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 219 rand, the
highest close since Aug. 16. Copper advanced for the first time
in three days. Aluminum, nickel, tin and zinc also gained. The
dollar slid to a five-month low against the euro after the U.S.
left interest rates unchanged and indicated it would take
measures to spur economic recovery.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest gold
producer, increased 3.78 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 318.68 rand,
snapping three days of declines. The price of gold for immediate
delivery rose to a record for a third day after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said it will ease monetary policy to support economic
recovery. The spot price advanced as much as 1.8 percent to
$1,296.30 an ounce.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd.  (HAR SJ) rose
76 cents, or 1 percent, to 78.89 rand.  Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP SJ), a generic drugs
maker, surged the most since Sept. 1, rising 23 cents, or 3.5
percent, to 6.74 rand. The Durban-based company is finalizing
the sale of a 25 percent stake in Cipla Medpro Manufacturing to
Cipla Ltd. of India. The deal will help Cipla get manufacturing
approvals from the World Health Organization and the U.S.’s Food
and Drug Administration.  ELB Group Ltd.  (ELR SJ), a group with industrial interests,
climbed 1.19 rand, or 10 percent, to 12.89 rand, the highest
since Oct. 7, 2008. Net asset value increased 19 percent to
12.86 rand a share from a year earlier, ELB said.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ), a miner of the steelmaking
ingredient, dropped the most in more than two weeks, falling
4.98 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 351 rand. The company controlled
by Anglo American Plc is facing a strike over pay after wage
talks with South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers ended
without an agreement.  Pallinghurst Resources Ltd.  (PGL SJ), a commodities
investment company, gained the most in a week, rising 9 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to 4.12 rand. New-order mining rights have been
granted for the Tshipi iron-ore and manganese project and the
closure of the related Jupiter Mines Ltd. transaction will lift
the company’s net asset value.  Pioneer Foods Ltd.  (PFG SJ), the maker of Weet-Bix cereal,
fell for a third day, dropping 1.03 rand, or 2.1 percent, to
46.99 rand. The food maker, found guilty of fixing the price of
bread, said the fine it has to pay will exceed 350 million rand
($50 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
