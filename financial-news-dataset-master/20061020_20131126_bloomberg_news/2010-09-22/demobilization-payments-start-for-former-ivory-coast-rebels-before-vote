Former rebel soldiers in  Ivory
Coast , the West African nation planning for a long-delayed
presidential election, will begin receiving demobilization
payments funded by the government.  “More than 4,000 soldiers will receive their payouts” of
100,000 CFA francs ($202.76) over the next “two to three days,”
said Karna Soro, spokesman for the  Forces Nouvelles , in a phone
interview from the northern town of Korhogo. An additional
400,000 francs will be paid at a later date that Soro didn’t
specify.  The rebels took control of the northern half of the West
African nation after a 2002 civil conflict. A peace deal in 2007
included the payout plan, as well as disarmament of the soldiers
and the formation of mixed brigades of government and rebel
fighters, as precursors to holding an election.  Around 5,000 of the movement’s 33,000 soldiers have
disarmed so far. The planned Oct. 31 election is the seventh
poll date set since President  Laurent Gbagbo ’s mandate expired
in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
