The proposed new global banking
rules that more than double capital requirements for lenders
need to be implemented and supervised rigorously to be effective,
said the head of the group that drew them up.  The revised standards also need to keep pace with financial
innovation in a banking system that has stabilized and is
recovering,  Nout Wellink , chairman of the  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision , said at an international meeting of bank
supervisors in Singapore today.  “We must remember that memories fade quickly,” Wellink
said in a speech. “Regardless of how tough the new standards
are and how we expect them to increase the resilience of banks
and banking systems, they must be effectively implemented and
enforced.”  The Basel committee this month said it will require lenders
to have common equity equal to at least 4.5 percent of assets,
weighted according to their risk. Regulators will introduce an
additional capital buffer of 2.5 percent to withstand future
stress, and banks that fail to meet that second buffer would be
stopped from paying dividends, though not forced to raise cash.  While the measures will be phased in by the end of 2018,
Wellink encouraged lenders to implement them sooner.  “Countries should move faster if their banking systems are
profitable and able to do so without having to restrict
credit,” he said. “Banks should not be permitted to increase
their distributions if they are still below the ultimate target
but feel they can take their time to get there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
