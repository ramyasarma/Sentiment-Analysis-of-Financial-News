Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  asked  UniCredit SpA ’s shareholders to avoid a change in
the bank’s management and called the resignation of Chief
Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo  a mistake, Corriere della
Sera reported, without saying where it got the information.  Tremonti called on the heads of Italian banking
foundations, including Fondazione Cariverona and Fondazione CRT,
to support Profumo, the newspaper said. Profumo stepped down
today, ending his 13-year tenure as CEO of Italy’s largest bank,
after clashing with shareholders over Libyan investments in the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
