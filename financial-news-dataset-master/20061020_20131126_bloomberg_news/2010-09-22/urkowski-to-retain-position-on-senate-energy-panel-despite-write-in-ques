U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska, who is seeking reelection as a write-in candidate after
losing a Republican primary race, will be allowed to retain her
position as ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.  “We decided we would take no position” on her committee
role, said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican.  Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming will replace Murkowski as
vice chair of the Republican Conference, a post she resigned at
the urging of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
