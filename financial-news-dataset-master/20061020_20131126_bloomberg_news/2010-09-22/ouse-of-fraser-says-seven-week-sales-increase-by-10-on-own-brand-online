House of Fraser Plc , the U.K.’s
third-largest department store chain, said sales since July have
climbed 10 percent as it sold more own-label products and
expanded the number of brands it sells online.  Revenue at stores open at least a year climbed 10 percent
in the seven weeks since July, the privately held retailer said
today in a statement. Sales in the six months through July 31
climbed 8.4 percent on the same basis, while earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 22 percent to
13 million pounds ($20.4 million).  Chief Executive Officer  John King  is adding more own-brand
products such as the 1960s “Biba” womenswear line to increase
earnings at the 61-store chain. Own-brand items account for 11
percent of total sales and the company aims to lift that
percentage to as much as 40 percent.  Online revenue more than doubled in the first half as the
company increased its range to 700 brands, improved delivery
options and began selling products to shoppers in the U.S.,
Europe and Australia.  “We clearly are very encouraged by the strong demand for
our House Brands from our customers, and particularly pleased
with the recent launch of Biba,” King said in the statement.
“We are confident we will continue to deliver in the second
half of the year and beyond as we continue our brand and
operational developments.”  The retailer is adding its first franchised outlets in Abu
Dhabi in 2012, “with more planned for the future” through a
partnership with Retail Arabia, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
