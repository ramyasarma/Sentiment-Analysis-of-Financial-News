Treasury notes rose, pushing yields
on two- and five-year securities to record lows, a day after the
Federal Reserve said it will focus its $600 billion in asset
purchases through June on medium-maturity debt.  The yield on the 30-year bond touched a three-month  high 
after the central bank said yesterday it will buy fewer longer-
term securities than analysts had expected. U.S. notes remained
higher as the $10 billion auction of 10-year inflation-indexed
debt produced a record low yield of 0.409 percent and a report
showed initial jobless claims rose last week.  “Even though the Fed telegraphed their move, we are still
getting a very strong follow-through in Treasury prices,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “Investors weren’t invested as they should have been. The
fundamentals are still supportive of bond investors given where
inflation and growth expectations are.”  The five-year note yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.03 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 1.25 percent
security maturing in October 2015 climbed 11/32, or $3.44 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 1/32.  The  yield  on the 5-year note slid to an all-time low of
1.0148 percent. The 30-year bond yield rose three basis points
to 4.07 percent after touching 4.0910 percent, the highest since
July 29. The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
over 5-year notes widened to a record 3.05 percentage points.  Benchmark Yield Drop  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  dropped as much as 11 basis
points to 2.46 percent in the biggest intraday decrease in
almost a month. The 2-year note yield decreased to a record low
of 0.3118 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday the
central bank will expand asset purchases at a pace of about $75
billion a month through June under the policy known as
quantitative easing and “will adjust the program as needed” to
reduce unemployment and avert deflation.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  wrote in an opinion piece in
the Washington Post that resuming large-scale asset purchases
should boost economic growth through lower borrowing costs and
higher stock prices and that concern that the strategy will lead
to significant increases in inflation is “overstated.”  Treasuries due in 5 1/2 years to 10 years will account for
46 percent of the Fed’s purchases, according to the New York
Fed. Securities maturing in 17 years to 30 years will make up 4
percent of the total.  ‘Unloved’ Long Bond  “The unloved, ignored and rejected 30-year bond is just a
bystander this morning as intermediate Treasuries toot horns and
dance around with lampshades on,”  William O’Donnell , U.S.
government bond strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc’s RBS Securities Inc. unit, wrote in a
research note. “What the New York Fed announced yesterday
afternoon was akin to plugging in a toaster and chucking it in
the bathtub that the 30-year bond and I were playing in.” RBS
is one of the 18 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.  The government’s sale of 1.25 percent Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities maturing in July 2020 produced bids for
2.91 times the amount of debt sold, compared with a bid-to-cover
ratio of 2.80 percent at the Sept. 2 auction. The debt drew a
then-record-low yield of 1.019 percent at the prior sale.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 57.7 percent of the debt, the
highest since 2006.  Boon to TIPS  “The Fed doing aggressive QE is boosting longer-dated
inflation expectations, which is good for risky assets and
TIPS,” said  Alex Li , an interest-rate strategist in New York at
Deutsche Bank AG, another primary dealer.  The Treasury auctioned debt at a negative yield for the
first time on Oct. 25, when it sold $10 billion of five-year
TIPS. The sale drew a yield of negative 0.55 percent on
speculation the Fed will be successful in sparking inflation.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life
of the maturities known as the break-even rate, widened to as
much as 2.2 percentage points today from this year’s low of 1.47
percentage points on Aug. 25. The 30-year  break-even rate  was
2.58 percentage points after reaching 2.74 percentage points
yesterday, the most since May 2008.  Before its announcement this week, the Fed was already
reinvesting proceeds from its holdings of mortgage bonds in
Treasuries to keep money from draining out of the banking
system. The Fed bought today $4.765 billion of U.S. debt
maturing from December 2014 to May 2016.  Treasury notes remained higher after the  Labor Department 
reported that the number of claims for unemployment insurance
payments rose by 20,000 to 457,000 in the week ended Oct. 30.
The increase more than offset an 18,000 decrease the prior week.  The unemployment  rate  has been above 9 percent since May
2009. It was at 9.6 percent in October, unchanged from the
previous month, according to the median estimate of analysts
before tomorrow’s payrolls report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
