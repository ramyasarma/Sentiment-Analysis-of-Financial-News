Crude oil rose before a report
forecast to show U.S. inventories dropped for a third week and
as the dollar fell, spurring investor demand for commodities.  The Energy Department will probably say that supplies
slipped 1.75 million barrels, according to the median of 18
analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey. The Dollar Index,
a gauge of the currency versus six major trading partners, slid
to the lowest level since March 17.  “It makes sense that prices are heading higher this
morning because today’s report is expected to show a sizable
draw in crude-oil stocks,” said  Jason Schenker , the president
of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 94 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $75.91 a barrel at 9:02 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Futures are up 6 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for November settlement gained 37 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $78.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  The Dollar Index  slipped 0.7 percent to 79.844. The U.S.
currency traded at $1.3374 per euro, down 0.8 percent from
yesterday, after touching $1.3418 per euro, the lowest level
since April 17.  Gasoline inventories fell 250,000 barrels from 224.5
million, according to the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, climbed 100,000 barrels from 174.5 million. The
department is scheduled to release its weekly report at 10:30
a.m. in Washington.  API Supply Report  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported
yesterday that crude inventories grew by 2.23 million barrels to
364.1 million. Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved
in the same direction 75 percent of the time in the past four
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. gasoline  demand rebounded  from a 23-month low last
week, MasterCard Inc. reported yesterday. Motorists bought an
average 9.01 million barrels a day of the motor fuel, up 1.9
percent from the prior week, according to the weekly
SpendingPulse report. It was the first increase in five weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
