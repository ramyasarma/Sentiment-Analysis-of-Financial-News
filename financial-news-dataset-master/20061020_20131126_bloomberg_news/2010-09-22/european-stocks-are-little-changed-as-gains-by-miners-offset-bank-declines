European stocks were little changed
as gains by basic-resource companies offset declining banks.
U.S. index futures rose and Asian shares gained.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added less than 0.1 percent to
265.04 at 8:04 a.m. in London. Imperial Tobacco Group Plc gained
1.6 percent after the maker of Davidoff cigarettes said it
expects net revenue from tobacco to rise about 3 percent this
fiscal year as price increases offset a shipment decline.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3
percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed after the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority said the city’s economy will grow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
