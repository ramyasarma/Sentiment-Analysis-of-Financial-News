A recovery in Islamic investment
banks in Gulf Cooperation Council countries will require better
“risk management,” according to Moody’s Investors Service.  “The global financial crisis had brought about a near-
collapse of the Shariah-compliant investment bank model, with a
handful of spectacular mid-crisis defaults of a few SCIBs
further severely undermining the SCIB model,” Moody’s said in
an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
