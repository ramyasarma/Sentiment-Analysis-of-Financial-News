President  Hugo Chavez ’s opponents
may win a slender majority in the popular vote in this weekend’s
legislative elections, polling firm  Consultores 21  said.  The opposition had 46.6 percent support in the Consultores
21 poll, compared with 45.4 percent for Chavez’s socialist
party, known as PSUV. Almost 8 percent of respondents were
undecided, according to the Aug. 20 to Sept. 7 survey, which had
a margin of error of 2.24 percentage points.  Chavez allies have enjoyed near-total control of the 165-
seat assembly since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
