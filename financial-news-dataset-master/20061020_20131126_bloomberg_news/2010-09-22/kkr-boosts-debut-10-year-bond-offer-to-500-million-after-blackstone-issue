KKR & Co. , the private-equity firm
founded by buyout pioneers  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts  in
1976, is selling bonds for the first time, a week after
 Blackstone Group LP  issued $400 million of debt.  KKR, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in
July, boosted its offering of 10-year notes to $500 million from
$350 million, according to a person familiar with the sale. The
senior unsecured notes may be sold as soon as today, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  KKR is marketing debt as the New York-based firm expands
beyond traditional buyouts, in which it pools money from
investors to take over companies, and into capital markets,
underwriting equity and bond offerings. Yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds fell to 3.73 percent yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986.  The notes may be sold through KKR Group Finance Co. with
proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, KKR said
today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.  Kristi Huller , a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment beyond the
statement.  The notes may yield 387.5 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, the person said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Blackstone, the world’s largest buyout firm issued 5.875
percent of debt on Sept. 15 priced at a spread of 325 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes
maturing in 2021 were rated A by Standard & Poor’s.  KKR gained a listing in New York this year after combining
with its publicly traded European fund in 2009. KKR is rated A-
by S&P, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
