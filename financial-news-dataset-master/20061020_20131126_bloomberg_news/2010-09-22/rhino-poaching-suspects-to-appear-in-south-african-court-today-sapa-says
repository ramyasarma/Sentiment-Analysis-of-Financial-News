Nine people suspected of
masterminding a rhinoceros-poaching syndicate will appear in
court today in Musina, South Africa, Sapa reported, citing a
police spokesman.  The suspects include two veterinarians and a farmer, the
Johannesburg-based news agency cited Vishnu Naidoo as saying.
The arrests were made on Sept. 20 in Modimolle, in the northern
province of Limpopo.  More than 200 rhinos have been poached in the country this
year, compared with 122 killed last year, according to Sapa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
