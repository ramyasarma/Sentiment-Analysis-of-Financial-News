Zijin Mining Group Co.  fell the
most in a month in Hong Kong trading after a dam built to hold
tin-mining waste collapsed yesterday in China’s Guangdong
province following torrential rain.  Zijin  Mining, based in Fujian province, fell as much as
2.85 percent. The stock traded 1.7 percent lower at HK$5.87 as
of 10:38 a.m. Hong Kong time.  About 60 centimeters (24 inches) of rain from Typhoon
Fanapi as well as mud and rock slides triggered the accident at
the Yinyan tin mine, which is in trial production, Zijin Mining
said yesterday in a statement. Power, communications and
transport have been suspended at the site.  The incident comes less than three months after one of
Zijin’s copper mines leaked toxic waste into a river, poisoning
almost 2,000 metric tons of fish in the Ting River. Zijin was
forced to shut its copper plant at the Zijinshan mine in Fujian
after the spill.  Fanapi has brought the heaviest rains in a century to the
southern province of Guangdong, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported. Heavy rain triggered floods and landslides in
Guangdong’s Maoming City, where more than 8,000 people were
evacuated, Xinhua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
