Sales of U.K. corporate bonds will
increase as companies seek alternatives to financing from banks
facing new rules on lending limits, according to Standard &
Poor’s.  Corporate bond net issuance rose by 22.1 billion pounds
($35 billion) since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September 2008 to the second quarter of this year, S&P
said in a report citing Bank of England data. By contrast, net
lending to British companies fell 59.1 billion pounds in the
same period.  Banks, forced to raise additional capital to meet rules set
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are seeking to
reduce lending and limit the size of the loans they underwrite,
S&P analysts lead by  Paul Watters , head of European corporate
research, wrote in the report. This will crimp funding for
companies refinancing debt and finance investment including
acquisitions, Watters said.  “We anticipate a longer term structural impetus for rising
bond issuance over bank loans for mid-size and larger
companies,” said  Paul Watters , adding that it will be driven by
the Basel III bank capital adequacy rules, as well as “a
reduction by banks in non-relationship corporate lending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
