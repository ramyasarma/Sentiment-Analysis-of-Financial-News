South Africa’s central bank awarded
former Governor  Tito Mboweni  a 17 percent pay increase in the
past fiscal year, even after he left the bank half way through
the year.  Mboweni’s salary, fringe benefits and other payments
amounted to 5.09 million rand ($724,000) in the year through
March, the  central bank  said in its annual report, released in
Pretoria today. He was paid 4.33 million rand in the previous
fiscal year.  Mboweni declined to renew his contract as governor for a
third term last year and was replaced by  Gill Marcus  in
November. Included in Mboweni’s pay is 2.6 million rand for a
“cooling-off period” from his resignation on Nov. 9 through
March 31. Marcus was paid 1.7 million rand for working over that
period.  The bank paid Mboweni an additional 1.9 million rand
between April 1 and May 8, when his “cooling-off period”
ended, the annual report said.  Among the bank’s deputy governors,  Xolile Guma ’s pay
increased 3.8 percent to 3.05 million rand, while  Renosi Mokate ,
who left the bank on July 31, got a 10 percent raise to 3.35
million rand, which included fringe benefits such as study aid
for dependents, the central bank said.  Daniel Mminele , who was
appointed deputy governor in June 2009, was paid 2.3 million
rand.  Limit Increases  The governor and deputy governors agreed in September 2003
to limit their pay increases to the mid-point of the 3 percent
to 6 percent inflation target range.  Inflation , which reached
3.7 percent in July, has stayed inside the target since
February.  Average wage settlements in South Africa reached 8.2
percent in the first half of 2010, the central bank said in its
Quarterly Bulletin, released in Pretoria today. Those increases
probably will persist into the rest of the year with public-
sector workers, including nurses and teachers, suspending a 20-
day strike on Sept. 6 to consider the government’s improved
offer to increase wages by 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
