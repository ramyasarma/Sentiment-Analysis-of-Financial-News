China’s urbanization of 400 million
migrant workers over the next two decades will require 2
trillion yuan ($300 billion) of investment a year, a research
report quoted by  China News Service said.   Central and local governments and the market will need to
bear the cost of spending on health, education, infrastructure,
social security and housing, the official  China Development
Research Foundation  said, China News reported today.  The “2010 China Development Report” refers to migrant
workers who have permanent employment in the city or who have
lived there for a long time, and who would volunteer to become
urban residents. China’s urbanization rate may reach 65 percent
by 2030, from 46.6 percent last year, if the economy continues
to grow, the report said.  Currently, migrant workers don’t receive the same benefits
as official urban residents, including medical care and
schooling for their children. Jiang Changyun, a researcher with
the Institute of Industrial and Technological Economics under
the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a China
Daily  commentary  Sept. 9 that Chinese cities may develop a
“dual economic structure” of differing incomes and public
services if integration of migrants is not properly resolved.  The foundation’s report said migrants don’t integrate into
urban society due to the differences in benefits.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editors:  Paul Panckhurst ,  Mark McCord .  To contact the reporter on this story:
