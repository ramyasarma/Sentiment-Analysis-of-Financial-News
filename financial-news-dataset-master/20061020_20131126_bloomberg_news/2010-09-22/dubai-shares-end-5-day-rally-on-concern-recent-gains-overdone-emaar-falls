Dubai shares declined the most in
almost three months on speculation recent gains may be overdone
and after U.S. and European stocks retreated on concern the
global economic recovery is faltering. Abu Dhabi shares fell.  Emaar Properties PJSC , builder of the world’s tallest
tower, decreased the most since July and  Dubai Investments PJSC 
dropped 3.5 percent. The  DFM General Index  lost 1.6 percent, the
most since June 29, to 1,673.69 at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai.
Abu Dhabi’s  gauge  slipped 0.3 percent. Dubai’s index has surged
13 percent this month and Abu Dhabi’s has jumped 5.3 percent.  “It’s inevitable that we would see some profit-taking
after the recent gains,” said  Paul Cooper , managing director at
Sarasin-Alpen & Partners Ltd. in Dubai, which oversees more than
$500 million in the Middle East. “Dubai had a strong run on the
back of the Dubai World announcement and the FTSE Group
inclusion.”  Shares of 21 companies including Emaar were added to the
FTSE’s Global Equity Index after the close on Sept. 17 as the
United Arab Emirates was classified as a secondary emerging
market. Dubai World, one of three main state-owned holding
companies, on Sept. 10 received approval from creditors to alter
the terms on $24.9 billion of debt.  Emaar Falls  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.3 percent
yesterday as investors shifted into Treasuries amid speculation
the Federal Reserve will purchase more government debt to buoy
the economy. “The committee will continue to monitor the
economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to
provide additional accommodation if needed to support the
economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels
consistent with its mandate,” the Federal Open Market Committee
said yesterday. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  lost 1.2 percent.  About 192 million shares  traded  in Dubai today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of 224 million. Emaar fell 2.9
percent, the most since July 25, to 3.73 dirhams and Dubai
Investments, which owns stakes in more than 40 companies, slid
the most since May 25 to 93 fils.  Qatar’s  QE Index  and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of Gulf
stocks were little changed. Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  gained 0.7
percent and the  Kuwait SE Price Index  advanced 0.4 percent.
