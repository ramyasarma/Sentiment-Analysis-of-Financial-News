Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  has increased his majority in the lower house of
parliament before a key vote next week, even after a group of
former allies abandoned his party, supporters said.  The government, which needs 316 votes for an absolute
majority in the Chamber of Deputies, won a secret ballot today
on the use of wiretaps, 308 to 285. The majority would have had
328 votes had about 20 of its members been present to take part
in the ballot, said  Nicola Cosentino , a lawmaker and former
undersecretary of finance.  “Berlusconi’s government emerges stronger from this
vote,” Cosentino told reporters in Rome. “There’s an ample
majority.”  The government’s survival will be tested on Sept. 29 when
the chamber votes on whether to back Berlusconi after he
outlines his goals for the rest of his term, which expires in
2013. Berlusconi is seeking new allies so that he can govern
without the support of Chamber Speaker  Gianfranco Fini ’s
splinter group, which defected from his party in July.  Fini can count on about 35 votes, previously thought to be
enough to sink the government. He has pledged to support the
premier in next week’s vote. The group had said it wouldn’t back
the government in today’s vote, aimed at blocking the inclusion
of wiretaps in a trial against Cosentino.  Cosentino is accused of collusion with the Camorra, a
Naples-area crime group made famous by  Roberto Saviano ’s book
“Gomorrah.” He denies any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
