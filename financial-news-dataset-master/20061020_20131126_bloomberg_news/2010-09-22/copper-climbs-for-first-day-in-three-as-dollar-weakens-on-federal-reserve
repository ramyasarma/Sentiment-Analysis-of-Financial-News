Copper rose to a five-month high as
the slumping dollar bolstered the appeal of commodities as
alternative investments.  The greenback touched to a six-month low against a basket
of six major currencies after the Federal Reserve yesterday left
its benchmark interest-rate target at the lowest level ever and
pledged to consider taking more steps to spur economic growth.  “We’re seeing a metals-based rally because of the weakness
in the dollar and the fear the Fed may have to make more asset
purchases to lift the economy,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.
“The underlying theme is the weak dollar.”  Copper futures for December delivery jumped 8.4 cents, or
2.4 percent, to settle at $3.565 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3.5905, the
highest level for a most-active contract since April 16.  Copper is up 24 percent in the past year as manufacturing
increased in China, the world’s biggest user. Inventories
monitored by the London Metal Exchange have dropped 24 percent
in 2010.  “The weaker dollar is going to re-ignite demand for copper
from overseas, especially China,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  Before today, the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials climbed 5.4 percent this month.  Copper for delivery in three months rose $165, or 2.1
percent, to $7,845 a metric ton ($3.56 a pound) on the LME.
Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
