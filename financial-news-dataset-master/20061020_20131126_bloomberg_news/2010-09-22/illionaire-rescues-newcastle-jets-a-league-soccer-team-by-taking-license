The Newcastle Jets will continue in
the A-League this season after local businessman Nathan Tinkler 
took over the Australian soccer club’s license, Football
Federation Australia said.  Tinkler stepped in after the Sydney-based governing body
withdrew the license of former owner Con Constantine because the
2008 A-League champion failed to show “it had the financial
capacity to continue operating.”  “We have signed an agreement with Nathan Tinkler which
secures the club’s participation for this season,” FFA Chief
Executive Officer  Ben Buckley  said in a statement. “The
agreement also grants an option for him to acquire the license
for the long term.”  The change in ownership comes after players and coaches
went unpaid and the club secured a short-term loan of A$300,000
($287,000) from the FFA, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  Tinkler is Australia’s wealthiest person under the age of
40, with an estimated fortune of A$441 million, according to
Business Review Weekly.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
