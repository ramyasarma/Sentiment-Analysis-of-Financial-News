A Novartis AG experimental drug
reduced abnormally high hormone levels in patients with
Cushing’s disease, a condition linked to a benign tumor of the
pituitary gland.  After six months, the treatment, called SOM230, reduced the
amount of cortisol in the urine in quarter of the patients
receiving a higher dose of the drug, the Basel, Switzerland-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The illness is caused by a tumor or excessive growth of the
pituitary gland at the base of the brain. This triggers the
release of a hormone that makes the body produce too much
cortisol, a stress hormone that controls the body’s use of food
and helps handle the immune system’s response to swelling,
according to the National Institute of Health.  “Up to half of patients with Cushing’s disease cannot be
cured with currently available options, which include surgery or
radiotherapy of the tumor, leaving a critical need for medical
treatments,” Annamaria Colao of the University of Naples and
one of the study investigators, said in the Novartis release.  The study, the last of three usually needed for U.S.
regulatory approval, included 162 patients. A quarter of those
receiving SOM230 at the higher of two possible doses had normal
urinary free cortisol levels, a measure of the disease.  Novartis plans to ask U.S. regulators for marketing
authorization by the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
