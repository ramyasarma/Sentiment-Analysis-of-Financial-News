JPMorgan Chase & Co.  hired Cantor
Fitzgerald LP’s former head of debt capital markets,  Irvin Goldman , to help manage the second-largest U.S. bank’s capital.  Goldman, who left Cantor in 2007, started this month as a
managing director for JPMorgan’s  chief investment office ,
according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to
be identified because the hire wasn’t announced publicly. The
group manages the interest rate and foreign exchange risks of
JPMorgan’s day-to-day transactions and invests its corporate
portfolio.  Tasha Pelio , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment, as did Goldman, reached at his office at the New York-
based bank.  Goldman left Cantor after helping to rebuild the broker’s
businesses following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center, which killed 658 of its 960 New York-based
employees.  Cantor hired Goldman in June 2003 to expand its bond sales
and trading business and build an asset management unit. Cantor
was named a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in 2006, becoming the first addition in more than two years
to the group of firms that trade directly with the central bank.  Before joining Cantor, Goldman worked 13 years at Credit
Suisse First Boston and ran sales and trading for interest-rate
products, according to a 2003  statement  on Cantor’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
