Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  may
sell its largest real-estate asset, the apartment-complex owner

affiliates for “yet undefined consideration,” according to a

S.a.r.l, according to a Sept. 20 filing by Uzzi, who represents
a group of defunct Lehman’s creditors including hedge fund 
Paulson & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
