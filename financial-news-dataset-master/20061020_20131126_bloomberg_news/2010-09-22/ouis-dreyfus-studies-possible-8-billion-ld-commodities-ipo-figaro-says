Louis Dreyfus is studying the
possibility of an initial public offering for its LD
Commmodities unit, French daily Le Figaro reported, without
saying where it got the information.  LD Commodities had net income of about $800 million in
2009, according to the newspaper. The unit might be worth about
$8 billion, Le Figaro said, using its own calculations. Louis
Dreyfus declined to comment, the newspaper added.  Other possibilities being studied include selling shares in
LD Commodities’ sugar activities on the Brazilian stock market,
or in some energy activities in the U.S.  The company may make a decision in coming weeks, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
