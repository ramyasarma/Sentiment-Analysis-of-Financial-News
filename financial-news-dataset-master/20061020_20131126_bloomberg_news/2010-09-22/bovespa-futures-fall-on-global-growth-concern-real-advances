Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index rose
to the highest level in seven weeks as record credit and
consumer confidence boosted the outlook for property firms,
while rising commodities prices lifted producers.  Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA  reached a
record, leading real-estate gains after Brazilian consumer
confidence rose for a seventh month and bank lending grew the
most in a year.  BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of Latin America’s
biggest exchange, also rose to a record, surging ahead of a $78
billion stock offering by  Petroleo Brasileiro SA . Iron-ore
miners  Vale SA  and  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA  rallied as
metals prices gained.  The  Bovespa  rose 0.9 percent to 68,325.18, the highest
level since Aug. 5, at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4
p.m. New York time. Forty-eight stocks gained on the index while
19 fell. The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7188 per dollar. The
Bovespa, which is down 0.4 percent in 2010, has rebounded 17
percent from a May 20 low.  “These are numbers that confirm the momentum of the
Brazilian economy,” said  Leonardo Boguszewski , who helps
oversee 380 million reais ($221.1 million) at Parana Banco Asset
Management in Curitiba, Brazil. “There’s general optimism.”  Brazilian outstanding bank lending expanded 2.2 percent in
August from the previous month, the largest increase since July
2009, according to the central bank. Loans rose to 1.58 trillion
reais, the bank said in a statement distributed today in
Brasilia.  Consumer Confidence  Brazilian consumers became more confident in the economy in
September. The Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation’s
gauge of consumer confidence rose to 121.7 on a seasonally
adjusted basis, from 120.9 last month, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  MRV advanced the most since May 21, rising 5.8 percent to
17.42 reais as the  BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index  gained 2.1
percent. BM&FBovespa, which runs the Sao Paulo exchange, jumped
2.4 percent to 14.69 reais. Vale increased 1.6 percent to 43.35
reais and MMX climbed 2.6 percent to 13.38 reais as the
 Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index  rose 2.1
percent.  Petrobras  lost 1.4 percent to 25.98 reais as crude declined
in New York. The state-controlled oil producer plans to disclose
the price of the world’s biggest share sale tomorrow. Its
ordinary and preferred stock, which together account for 12
percent of the Bovespa’s weighting, have each slumped 29 percent
this year on concern the offering will dilute earnings per
share.  ‘Flat This Year’  “Petrobras explains a good part of why the market is flat
this year,” Boguszewski said. “The market should perform well
after the offering.”  The  Bovespa  index trades for 12.7 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 12.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.6
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Brazilian stocks fell yesterday as commodity prices
retreated and quicker-than-forecast inflation spurred
speculation policy makers will raise borrowing costs to cool the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
