KKR & Co. , the private-equity firm
that moved its shares to the New York Stock Exchange in July,
sold bonds for the first time, a week after  Blackstone Group LP 
issued $400 million of debt.  KKR boosted its offering of 10-year senior unsecured notes
to $500 million from $350 million, according to a person
familiar with the sale. The notes yield 387.5 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  The company is tapping the debt market as the New York-
based firm expands beyond traditional buyouts, in which it pools
money from investors to take over companies, and into capital
markets, underwriting equity and bond offerings. Yields on
investment-grade corporate bonds fell to 3.73 percent yesterday,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the lowest since
daily records began on Oct. 31, 1986.  The notes were sold through KKR Group Finance Co.,
Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general corporate
purposes, KKR said today in a statement distributed by Business
Wire.  Kristi Huller , a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment
beyond the statement.  Blackstone, the world’s largest buyout firm, issued 5.875
percent debt on Sept. 15 priced at a spread of 325 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes maturing in
2021 were rated A by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  KKR gained a listing in New York this year after combining
with its publicly traded European fund in 2009. KKR is rated A-
by S&P, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
