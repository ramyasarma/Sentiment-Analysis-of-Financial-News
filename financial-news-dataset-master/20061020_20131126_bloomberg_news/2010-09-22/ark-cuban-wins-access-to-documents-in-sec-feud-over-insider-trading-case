Billionaire Mark Cuban, who lost a
bid for dismissal of insider-trading allegations by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, won access to documents in
his feud with the agency.  U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton in Washington today
ruled that the SEC didn’t have the right to withhold dozens of
documents Cuban requested, that its search for other records was
inadequate and that it can’t freeze the litigation for three
years while it completes his request for still others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
