The Slovak government approved an
increase in value-added and excise taxes to cut the fiscal
deficit in the east European euro-region member by a third.  The Cabinet today approved an austerity package that
includes a temporary increase of VAT for most goods and services
to 20 percent from 19 percent, and higher taxes on beer and
cigarettes, Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  told journalists in
Bratislava. The decision follows an agreement yesterday of the
four governing coalition leaders on a 2011 budget with the
 deficit  projected at 4.9 percent of gross domestic product from
an expected 7.8 percent this year.  The measures are part of a package that seeks to raise 770
million euros ($1 billion) in additional revenue, while 980
million euros will be saved through spending cuts.  Radicova’s administration, in power since July, needs to
tackle a widening budget deficit and at the same time minimize
the impact of austerity measures on the economy, which has
resumed growth this year after slipping into its first-ever
 recession  in 2009. The fiscal tightening will cause economic
growth to slow to 3.3 percent next year from 4 percent this
year, according to a Finance Ministry forecast on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
