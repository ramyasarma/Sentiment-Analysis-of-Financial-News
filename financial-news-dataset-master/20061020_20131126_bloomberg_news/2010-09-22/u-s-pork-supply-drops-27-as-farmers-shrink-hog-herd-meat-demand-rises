Pork stockpiles in the U.S.
fell 27 percent at the end of August from a year earlier as
farmers cut the size of their herds and meat prices surged.  Warehouses held 384.9 million pounds of pork, down
from 530.1 million on Aug. 31, 2009, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Inventories shrank 1.6
percent from the end of July.  August pork output may have been 2.5 percent smaller
than a year earlier, said  Bob Brown , an independent market
analyst. The USDA will release production data for the
month on Sept. 24. In June, the hog-breeding herd was near
the smallest size on record, as losses in 2008 and 2009
spurred culls.  Wholesale pork  reached a record 96.74 cents
a pound on Aug. 24, according to the USDA.  “Prices were high, and people wanted to use up what
they had in the freezers,” Brown said from Edmond,
Oklahoma. “It was a good time to empty them out.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.825 cent,
or 1.1 percent, to 76.25 cents a pound at 12:50 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained
17 percent this year, partly on limited supplies.  Stockpiles of pork bellies, which are cured and sliced
to make bacon, plunged 86 percent on Aug. 31 from a year
earlier to 6.89 million pounds, according to today’s
report. That’s the lowest on record for the date, according
to the USDA. Warehouse supplies of ham rose 2.7 percent to
139.6 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of August were 7.6
percent larger than a year earlier at 695.4 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies shrank 8.3 percent to 385.2
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
