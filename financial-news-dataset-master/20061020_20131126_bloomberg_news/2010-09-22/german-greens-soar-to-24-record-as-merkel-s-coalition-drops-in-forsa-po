Germany’s opposition Green party,
leading the campaign against Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plans to
extend the running time of nuclear-power plants, gained two
percentage points to a record 24 percent in a Forsa poll for
Hamburg-based  Stern  magazine.  That puts the Greens on the same level of support as the
main opposition Social Democratic Party, giving the traditional
allies a combined 48 percent, enough to form a government if
elections were held now, Stern said today in an e-mail.  Merkel’s Christian Democrats and their CSU Bavarian allies
dropped a point to 29 percent, almost five points below their
score at the elections last September when Merkel won a second
term. Her Free Democratic Party coalition partner was unchanged
on 5 percent, the threshhold to win parliamentary seats and
almost 10 points adrift of its election result.  Forsa polled 2,501 voters on Sept. 13-17. The margin of
error is as much as 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
