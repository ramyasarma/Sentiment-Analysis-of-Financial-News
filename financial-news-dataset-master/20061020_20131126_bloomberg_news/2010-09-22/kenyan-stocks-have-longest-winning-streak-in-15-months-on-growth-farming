Kenyan stocks rose for the 11th
day, the longest streak of gains in 15 months, as prices of
agricultural products that make up 25 percent of output gained
and the government said growth may exceed targets in 2010.  The 55-member  Nairobi Stock Exchange All-Share Index 
rallied the most in a week, climbing 0.9 percent to close at
83.36, the highest since July 2008, by 3 p.m. in the capital.
That takes the gain over the 11-day period to 7 percent.  The average price of tea from Kenya, the world’s biggest
grower of black tea, added 2.1 percent to $2.87 per kilogram
(2.2 pounds), Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd. said yesterday.
Kenya’s benchmark coffee grade rose 18 percent at an auction
yesterday amid diminishing supplies, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange
said. Kenya’s economy may grow faster in 2010 than the
government’s earlier target of 4.5 percent, fuelled by good
rains that boosted tea production and “strong” expansion in
tourism and manufacturing, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said
Sept. 20.  “We have seen the commodity prices holding quite well,”
 Eric Musau , a research analyst at African Alliance Kenya
Securities Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi today. “The weather
patterns have been favorable to them and production has
increased.”  Farming accounts for about 25 percent of gross domestic
product in East Africa’s biggest economy. Tea production in the
country rose 61 percent to 183,946 metric tons in the year to
May, the central bank said today.  Growth  “There is a growing sense of optimism, about a much faster
economic recovery,” Aly-Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based
independent analyst, said by phone today.  Economic growth accelerated to an annual 4.4 percent in the
first quarter after rainfall ended a two-year drought and
provided a boost to agriculture, the country’s National Bureau
of Statistics said on July 1. Gross domestic product increased
2.6 percent in 2009 and 1.7 percent the year earlier, from 7.1
percent in 2007, following post-election violence that killed
1,500 people and dry weather.  Gains over the period were led by  Housing Finance Co. , the
country’s only publicly traded mortgage company, which advanced
11 percent. Housing Finance began the sale of 5 billion
shillings ($62 million) of bonds on Sept. 20 to help increase
lending and housing supply. Kenya’s urban areas need 150,000
housing units a year compared with the 35,000 available at the
moment, the company said Aug. 31  Financials  Standard Chartered Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the local unit of
Standard Chartered Plc, climbed 10 percent. The bank was rated
“buy” in new coverage by Genghis Capital Ltd. on Sept. 20,
while Sterling Investment Bank Ltd. said the lender’s
acquisition of Barclays Bank Plc’s African custody business will
boost earnings growth.  “Financials tend to be a big choice for investors when an
economy is in recovery mode,” Musau said.  Kenya Power and Lighting Co. , the country’s only
electricity distributor, rose 18 percent over the period.
Workers canceled a strike planned to start on Sept. 20 after the
company’s management agreed to hire more full-time employees.
Yesterday, the stock advanced to a three-year high after Kenya
and the African Development Bank signed a 3.97 billion-shilling
($49 million) agreement to build a power line to neighboring
Uganda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
