Nakheel PJSC, the Dubai World-owned
property developer, is close to reaching a final agreement with
its creditors,  Al Ittihad  reported, citing a government official
it didn’t identify.  Nakheel received the percentage of approval it requires
from creditors to reach the settlement, the newspaper said.
Construction Delivery Group is the only creditor that rejected
Nakheel’s offer, Al Ittihad reported, citing the United Arab
Emirates’ Contractors Association chairman Ahmed Saif Belhasa.  Nakheel, which is building palm-shaped islands off Dubai’s
coast, said on July 14 a group of creditors unanimously
supported a plan on altering the terms on $10.5 billion of loans
and unpaid bills. The company expects to pay 40 percent of the
money owed to trade creditors in cash and 60 percent through a
tradeable sukuk, Nakheel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
