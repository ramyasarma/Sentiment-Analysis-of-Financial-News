Brazilian  bank lending  in August
expanded at its fastest pace since July 2009, adding to pressure
on the central bank to raise borrowing costs in 2011.  The stock of outstanding credit increased 2.2 percent in
August from the previous month, led by an increase in mortgage
lending, the central bank said in a statement distributed today
in Brasilia. State and non-state bank lending rose to 1.58
trillion reais ($920 billion), up 19.2 percent from a year ago.  Today’s number shows that domestic demand and credit growth
are driving an unsustainable rate of growth in Latin America’s
largest economy, which will fuel higher inflation in 2011, said
 Caio Megale , an economist and partner at Mau Sekular
Investimentos in Sao Paulo.  “This deceleration that people talked about didn’t really
happen,” Megale said. “We have a threat that inflation will be
considerably above target next year.”  Mortgage lending, which accounts for about 7.6 percent of
total lending, rose 3.9 percent to 120.6 billion reais from a
revised 116.1 billion reais in July, the bank said.  Credit rose to 46.2 percent of gross domestic product, from
a revised 45.5 percent in July. The average interest rate
charged on credit fell to 35.2 percent, from 35.4 percent in
July.  The total loan default rate was 4.8 percent in August, down
from a revised 4.9 percent in July. The default rate has fallen
continually from a rate of 5.9 percent in August 2009. The
company loan default rate was 3.6 percent, unchanged from July,
and the default rate for personal loans was 6.2 percent, down
from a revised 6.3 percent.  Bank profits rose on higher lending after the economy
expanded at an annual rate of  8.8 percent  in the second quarter.  Banco do Brasil  and  Itau  Unibanco Holding SA, the nation’s
largest bank by market value, increased earnings by at least 35
percent in the second quarter. Osasco-based  Banco Bradesco  SA,
the second-largest bank by market value, said second-quarter
adjusted net income increased 23 percent.  Brazilian economists expect the central bank to resume
interest rate increases in March, and to lift the Selic to 11.75
percent by June, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 17
central bank survey of about 100 economists.  Brazil’s currency fell 0.5 percent to 1.7198 per U.S.
dollar at 11:01 a.m. New York time. Since the beginning of the
month, the real has strengthened 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
