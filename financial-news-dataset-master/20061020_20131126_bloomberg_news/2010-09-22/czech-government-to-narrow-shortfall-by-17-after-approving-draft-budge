The Czech Cabinet approved a 2011
state budget draft that narrows the deficit by 17 percent, Prime
Minister  Petr Necas  said at a press conference today.  The central state  budget , the main part of broader public
finances that serve as the fiscal measure for assessing a
country’s readiness to adopt the euro, will have a deficit limit
of 135 billion koruna ($7.4 billion), compared with the 163-
billion ceiling this year, according to the approved budget,
Necas said.  Prime Minister Petr Necas’s government, in office since
July, plans to reduce the public finance gap to 3.5 percent of
gross domestic  product  in 2012 and to 2.9 percent by 2013 from
5.9 percent in 2009, with the cuts including lower spending on
public wages. The draft must still be approved by parliament.  As many as 25,000 to 30,000 policemen, firemen and other
public workers marched  through Prague’s Old Town yesterday to
protest against wage cuts plans, the CTK newswire cited police
spokeswoman Ivana Jezkova as saying.  The government plans to cut 10 percent from money allocated
for public wages and operating costs next year, while investment
will decline 5 percent and social spending will drop by more
than 10 billion koruna.  The public-finance gap widened last year when the Czech
Republic fell into its worst recession since the end of
communism two decades ago. The economy, where exports such as
cars made by Skoda Auto AS account for about 70 percent of GDP,
will grow this year as western European demand for its products
recovers, the  Finance Ministry  forecasts.  Necas, whose 118 lawmakers in the 200-seat lower house of
parliament give him the biggest majority since the Czech
Republic came into existence in 1993, plans to cut spending as
well as boost revenue to meet the fiscal target next year. The
ceiling for public finance deficit was set at 4.6 percent of GDP
in 2011, compared with this year’s target of 5.3 percent.  The fiscal plans have helped the koruna strengthen against
the euro and delivering on the deficit reduction may prompt an
increase in the country’s credit rating. The koruna has gained
5.2 percent against the euro since the May 28-29 elections,
making the world’s third best-performing currency for the
period.  The Czech Republic’s A debt rating may be raised if the
government follows through on pledges to reduce spending,
including an overhaul of the pension system, Standard & Poor’s
said on Aug. 10. S&P revised its outlook on the country’s long-
term credit rating to “positiv” from “stable,” the rating
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
