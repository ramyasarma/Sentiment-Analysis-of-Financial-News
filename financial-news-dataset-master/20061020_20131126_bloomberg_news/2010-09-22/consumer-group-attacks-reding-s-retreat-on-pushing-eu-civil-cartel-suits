Consumers may suffer if  Viviane Reding , the European Union’s justice chief, drops a bid to spur
civil lawsuits against price-fixers, a customer-rights group
said.  The European Consumers’ Organization, BEUC, said it’s
disappointed by comments Reding made in an  interview  published
in Financial Times Deutschland, in which she said efforts to
encourage more cartel-damages claims were “no longer on the
agenda.”  “Illegal profit should not stay in the wrong pockets,”
BEUC said in a letter to Reding, obtained by Bloomberg News.
“Consumers see their rights being violated by traders and they
are paying the price of competition infringements whilst their
right to compensation remains non-existent.”  Neelie Kroes , the former competition commissioner,
championed lawsuits as a way to compensate victims of unlawful
monopolies and cartels. Such lawsuits, in addition to fines that
can reach millions of euros, could help victims recover losses
and deter antitrust violations, she argued.  Reding’s spokesman  Matthew Newman  said the commission “is
continuing to look” at what forms of collective redress could
fit into the EU legal system.  The regulator imposed 1.6 billion euros ($2.14 billion) in
cartel fines last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
