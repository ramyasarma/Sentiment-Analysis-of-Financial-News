JPMorgan Chase & Co.  has sold $6.06
billion of corporate bonds for Texas-based energy companies,
excluding utilities, so far this year, more than the $5.03
billion it sold in all of 2009 and the highest amount in at
least a decade.  The bank, based in New York, is the top arranger of
corporate bonds for coal, oil and natural-gas companies in the
Lone Star state this year with 20 percent of the market, the
largest share controlled by a single firm since 2003, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy producers and companies that provide them with
equipment and pipeline services are benefiting from borrowing
costs near the lowest on record, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. They’re also capitalizing on investor
discontent with equity markets, said  Sean Sexton  with Fitch
Ratings Ltd. The value of JPMorgan’s Texas energy-bond sales
rose even as they fell in number to 25 from 37 in all of 2009.  “Even for companies with no near-term need for cash, now’s
a smart time to refinance bonds set to mature in the latter half
of 2011 or 2012 because nobody’s sure if interest rates will
still be this low by then,” said Sexton, managing director of
energy, chemicals and commodities for New York-based Fitch.
“They’ve got to strike while the iron’s hot.”  Energy company bond yields fell to 4.04 percent on Aug. 24,
the lowest on record going back to December 1996, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporates Energy index shows.  The securities yield 4.07 percent as of Sept. 21, compared
with the overall investment-grade U.S. corporate bond market’s
yield of 3.73 percent, index data show.  Motiva, ATP  JPMorgan’s biggest Texas energy deals this year included $1
billion in 10- and 30-year bonds sold for Motiva Enterprises
LLC, a joint venture between Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil
company and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and $750 million in 5-year
debt for ATP Oil & Gas Corp. Both are Houston-based.  Almost two-thirds of JPMorgan’s Texas energy debt sales
occurred during the first half of the year, when the Standard &
Poor’s 500 equity index lost 7.6 percent of its value. The bank
has dominated the Texas energy debt market for seven of the past
11 years, Bloomberg data showed.  Justin Perras , a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment.  Credit Suisse Group AG was the second-biggest underwriter
this year with $3.07 billion in debt sales for Texas energy
companies on 12 issuances.  Duncan King , a spokesman for Credit
Suisse, declined to comment.  Last year’s second-best performer, Citigroup Inc., fell to
fourth with $2.87 billion in debt sales, down from $4.2 billion
in 2009.  Denbury Resources  The size of JPMorgan’s Texas underwriting this year ranged
from Motiva’s $1 billion debt sale to a $50 million issuance for
Plains Exploration & Production Co., a Houston-based oil and gas
explorer.  Denbury Resources Inc. was JPMorgan’s highest-paying Texas-
based energy client on a percentage basis. The Plano, Texas-
based oil producer was charged a 2 percent fee on $200 million
in 15-year bonds, Bloomberg data showed. That was more than
double the average 0.963 percent fee JPMorgan collected from the
Texas energy sector this year.  Oil, gas, coal, oilfield-equipment and pipeline companies
based in Texas sold $30.1 billion in debt during the year
through Sept. 17, compared with $36.6 billion for all of 2009,
Bloomberg data showed. The average size of each deal expanded to
$684 million from $530 million in 2009.  Before this year, the last time a single firm controlled
more than one-fifth of the Texas energy debt market was in 2003,
when Citigroup underwrote $2.66 billion in sales, or 22 percent
of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
