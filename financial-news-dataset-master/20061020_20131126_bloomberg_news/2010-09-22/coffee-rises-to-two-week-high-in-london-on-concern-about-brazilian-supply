Cocoa prices declined from a four-
week high amid signs of increasing supplies from Ivory Coast,
the world’s biggest producer. Sugar gained, and coffee dropped.  In the week ending Sept. 12, Ivorian farmers delivered
11,919 metric tons of cocoa to the ports of Abidjan and San
Pedro, according to an industry official. That compared with
9,940 tons a year earlier. Output probably will exceed demand by
75,000 tons in the season that starts next month, the
 International Cocoa Organization  has forecast. The estimate may
rise or fall by 25,000 tons.  “The sizeable crop that they’re still expecting” weighed
on prices, said  John Caruso , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. The market was “overbought” in
the short term, and prices fell as some investors booked profit
after the rally, he said.  Cocoa for December delivery fell $17, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $2,762 a ton at 11:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $2,834, the highest level for a
most-active contract since Aug. 24.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery dropped 19
pounds, or 1 percent, to close at 1,886 pounds ($2,950) a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Sugar, Coffee  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery climbed 0.42 cent, or
1.8 percent, to settle at 23.19 cents a pound at 2 p.m. in New
York. In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
rose $8.20, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $607 a ton.  Indonesia plans to import 450,000 tons of refined sugar
next year to replenish inventories after wet weather hurt
output.  “This should be supportive of premiums, which have come
under severe pressure recently,”  Thomas Kujawa , a co-head of
the soft-commodities department at Sucden Financial Ltd. in
London, said yesterday in a report.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 2.95
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $1.7995 a pound in New York.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for November delivery
gained $27, or 1.6 percent, to settle $1,696 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
