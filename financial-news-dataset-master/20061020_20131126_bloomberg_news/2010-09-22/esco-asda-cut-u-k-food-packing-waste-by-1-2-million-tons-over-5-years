Tesco Plc,  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ’s
Asda unit, J Sainsbury Plc and 39 more retailers and foodmakers
reduced U.K. food and packaging waste by 1.2 million tons in
2005 to 2009, a government-funded trash-reduction group said.  About 670,000 tons of food waste and 520,000 tons of
packaging, worth a combined 1.8 billion pounds ($2.8 billion)
were eliminated in the five years, equivalent to 128,000 refuse-
truckloads, the  Waste Resources & Action Programme  said today in
an e-mailed statement. About 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide
emissions were avoided in the process, WRAP said.  “The evidence shows that more people are now aware that
food waste is an issue,” WRAP Chief Executive Officer Liz
Goodwin said. “More people are checking their cupboards before
they shop, making lists and date labels are better understood.”  Lowering waste in the U.K. helps cut greenhouse gases and
reduces the area of landfill needed to contain trash. Tesco,
Asda, Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer Group Plc, Co-operative Group
Ltd. and Waitrose Ltd. have also pledged to cut plastic bag use
in half, following a campaign that began in May 2007 when the
retailers in Modbury, southwest England, banned the carriers.  Measures to reduce waste include reductions in the weight
of bottles made by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Coca-Cola Co.’s
largest distributor, cuts in cardboard and plastic used to wrap
Easter eggs by Kraft Foods Inc.’s Cadbury unit, and a change in
the plastic used by H.J. Heinz Co. in making ketchup bottles,
according to WRAP’s  website .  Food waste was cut at an annual rate of 270,000 tons in
March this year, beating the group’s 155,000-ton target. A goal
to get rid of packaging waste growth by 2008 was also met.  The companies missed a target of delivering absolute annual
reductions in packaging waste in 2010, with the annual total
remaining at about 2.9 million tons, WRAP said. That’s because
while average packaging per item declined, total grocery sales
increased by 6.4 percent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
