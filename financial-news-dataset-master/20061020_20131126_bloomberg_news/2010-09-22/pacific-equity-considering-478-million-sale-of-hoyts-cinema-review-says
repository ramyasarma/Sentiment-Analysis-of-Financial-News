Pacific Equity Partners is
considering either the sale of its Hoyts Group cinema chain for
more than A$500 million or an initial public offering, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The IPO market has weakened since Pacific Equity earlier
this year hired managers, including Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, to prepare a listing for the business, the newspaper
said in its Street Talk column.  To contact the reporter on this story:
