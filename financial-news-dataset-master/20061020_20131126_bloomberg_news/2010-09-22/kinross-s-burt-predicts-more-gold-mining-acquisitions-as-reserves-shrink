Kinross Gold Corp.  Chief Executive
Officer  Tye Burt  said he expects more mergers and acquisitions
in the gold-mining industry as producers try to cope with
declining reserves.  “The other big companies have traditionally used M&A as
another way to add to their futures, so we would expect that
consolidation trend to continue,” Burt said yesterday in an
interview at the Denver Gold Forum.  Kinross, which is based in Toronto, last month agreed to
buy Red Back Mining Inc. for C$6.8 billion ($6.7 billion) to
give it two gold projects in West Africa. The volume of gold-
mining takeovers announced so far this year is $38.2 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Red Back is Kinross’s largest acquisition to date. While
Burt didn’t rule out future deals, he said the company is
focused on developing existing mines.  “We never say never, but anything we do from here would
typically be a bolt-on or an add-on in a district that we’re
already focused in,” he said. “We’ve got a big job growing out
our current suite of projects.”  Kinross closed up 24 cents, or 1.2 percent, at C$19.55 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday. The  shares  have advanced
0.9 percent this year, valuing the company at C$13.8 billion.  Gold for immediate delivery in London has increased 18
percent in 2010. It was 0.5 percent higher at $1,293.20 an ounce
as of 11:57 a.m. local time after earlier trading at a record
$1,295.  To contact the reporter on this story:
