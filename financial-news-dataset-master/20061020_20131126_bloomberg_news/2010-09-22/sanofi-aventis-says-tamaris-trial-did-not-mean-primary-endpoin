Sanofi-Aventis SA  said a drug that
had showed promise in restoring blood vessel growth in damaged
limbs was no better than a placebo in an advanced test.  The medicine, known as NV1FGF, failed to meet the study’s
goal of preventing limb amputation or patient deaths over 12
months, Sanofi said today in a statement. San Diego-based  Vical
Inc ., which licensed the drug’s rights to Paris-based Sanofi,
 dropped  32 percent in  Nasdaq trading, the most in eight years.  “We are disappointed,”  Marc Cluzel , Sanofi’s executive
vice president of research and development, said in the
statement. “We are evaluating all options regarding the
development of NV1FGF.”  The medicine in earlier research had showed an ability to
promote the growth of new blood vessels and improve survival in
patients whose limbs were damaged by thrombosis or embolism, a
condition known as critical limb ischemia. The condition leads
to more than 150,000 amputations a year in the U.S. and Europe,
at a cost of more than $8 billion, Vical estimated in 2007 when
the study began. The 525-patient study’s full results will be
presented at the American Heart Association Congress in
November, Sanofi said today in its statement.  Vical plunged $1.24 to $2.62 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Sanofi fell 75 cents, or
1.5 percent, to 49.90 euros in Paris trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
