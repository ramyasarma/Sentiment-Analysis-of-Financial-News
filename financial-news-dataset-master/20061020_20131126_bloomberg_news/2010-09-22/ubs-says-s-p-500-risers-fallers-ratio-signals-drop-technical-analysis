The increase in the ratio of rising
to falling shares on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the
highest level since May is fuelling concern of a slide in
equities, according to the top-ranked UBS AG technical analysis
team.  A fall of less than 1 percent on the S&P 500 will breach a
key support level at 1,129 that may also prompt further selling,
UBS analysts  Michael Riesner  and  Marc Muller  wrote in a report
yesterday. The American Association of Individual Investors
survey of investor sentiment that showed a 51 percent jump in
bullish readings also shows UBS that the rally is “running out
of steam.” The proportion of advancing to declining shares
climbed Sept. 20 to the highest since May 13.  “We see headwind for equities,” Riesner wrote in the
report. “We continue to see the risk of another but significant
tactical down leg into October. The likelihood is increasing
that we will see a re-test of the July low.”  The S&P 500 has surged 11 percent from this year’s low on
July 2 as concern eased that American unemployment, which is
near the highest since the 1980s, and less spending from
indebted European nations would stall the global economic
recovery. The gauge has gained 2.2 percent so far this year,
leaving it 6.4 percent below its peak for 2010 when it closed
yesterday at 1,139.78 in New York.  Riesner and Muller are part of UBS’s winning team in this
year’s Thomson Extel survey for equity technical analysis and
charting in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
