The Philippines may follow up a
dollar debt exchange with a swap of local-currency bonds this
year to extend maturities and help the government balance its
budget, Finance Secretary  Cesar Purisima  said.  “Maybe sometime this year, we will do a local bond
exchange where some of the short-term local maturities will be
moved to the longer term,” Purisima, who was appointed finance
secretary in June, said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg
headquarters in New York. “We will continue to be opportunistic
when it comes to our borrowing plans.”  President  Benigno Aquino  is tapping new sources of
financing and seeking to extend the average maturity of the
country’s debt in a bid to bolster the government’s finances.
The  budget  has been in deficit for 21 of the last 25 years and
the shortfall is projected to widen to a record 325 billion
pesos ($7.4 billion) in 2010 from 298.5 billion pesos last year.  The government is looking to move investors out of short-
term debt and into bonds maturing in 15, 20 and 25 years in an
effort to boost trading of those securities, Purisima said. The
Philippines on Sept. 20 started an offer to sell and exchange as
much as $3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds due in 2021 and
2034 for existing shorter-dated notes.  The Philippines is in a “sweet spot” with regard to
borrowing costs thanks to low yields on U.S. Treasuries and
“ample domestic liquidity,” central bank Governor Amando
Tetangco said today. The rate on two-year Treasuries today
dropped to the lowest level on record after the Federal Reserve
signaled it may boost purchases of U.S. debt.  The Philippines has about 466 billion pesos ($10.6 billion)
of local and overseas debt falling due in 2011, up from about
416 billion this year, Treasurer Roberto Tan said last month.  Develop Local Market  The last time the Philippines conducted a peso debt swap
was in January 2009, when it issued 144.5 billion pesos of new
five- and seven-year notes. The two securities have become the
government’s most liquid benchmark bonds.  “What we’re really trying to do is also develop our local
capital markets,” Purisima said. The government plans to raise
73 percent of its 2011 funding requirements from the domestic
market next year, compared to an estimated 67 percent this year,
he said.  Any fresh funds to be raised as part of the ongoing dollar
bond exchange “are just intended to make the new issuance more
liquid,” Purisima said.  The government will accept dollar notes due in 2011 to 2017
for at least $500 million of new January 2021 bonds, and
securities maturing in 2019 to 2031 for additional 6.375 percent
October 2034 debt it is issuing, it said on Sept. 20.  Outperforms Region  The Philippines this month raised $1 billion from its first
sale of 10-year global peso bonds. The government plans to cut
overseas debt sales to $2.5 billion in 2011 from a projected
$4.1 billion this year.  Dollar-denominated debt issued by the Philippines has
 returned  16 percent this year, outperforming a 14 percent 
return for such securities issued by all Asian nations,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. Local Philippine
bonds have posted an 8.3 percent return, double the Asian
average, JPMorgan data show.  To contact the reporter for this story:
