Imperial Tobacco Group Plc,  the
maker of Davidoff cigarettes, said it expects net revenue from
tobacco to rise about 3 percent this fiscal year as price
increases offset a decline in deliveries.  Cigarette shipments have been similar to the first nine
months of the year, when they dropped 4.3 percent, Bristol,
England-based Imperial Tobacco said today in a statement. Loose-
tobacco volume will probably rise 6 percent for the 12 months
through Sept. 30, meaning total tobacco sold will show a decline
of about 3 percent, the company said.  "Solid pricing and strong fine-cut tobacco volumes in the
fourth quarter are the key positives,’’  Rogerio Fujimori , an
analyst at Credit Suisse with an "outperform"  recommendation  on
the stock, wrote in a report.  Tobacco companies  will be able to increase sales in coming
years as they still have pricing power, market research company
Euromonitor said yesterday, predicting 2 percent annual growth
in cigarette volume worldwide in the next five years.  Imperial Tobacco  rose  as much as 42 pence, or 2.2 percent,
to 1,935 pence and was up 1.5 percent at 9:21 a.m. in London
trading. The stock has lost 1.9 percent this year, while the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index has gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
