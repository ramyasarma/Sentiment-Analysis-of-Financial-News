Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
signed a decree banning the sale of weapons, including S-300 air
defense systems, to Iran in compliance with United Nations
sanctions against the Middle Eastern country.  The  decree  also bans the export, transit through Russia, or
transportation by Russian-flagged ships or aircraft of “any
combat tanks, combat armored vehicles, large-caliber artillery
systems, fighter planes, military helicopters, warships,
missiles and missile systems” bound for Iran.  Medvedev’s decree, which complies with UN sanctions
approved June 9, comes as both Israel and the U.S. voice concern
that Russian weapons may fall into the hands of terrorists.  Russian Defense Minister  Anatoly Serdyukov  said in an
interview Sept. 20 that Medvedev’s decision not to deliver S-300
missiles to Iran was “dictated by a complicated military and
political situation in the region and support of the United
Nations sanctions against Iran.”  Medvedev’s decree also bars the Iranian government,
companies or citizens from investing in any activity in Russia
connected with production of uranium, as well as the production
and use of nuclear materials and technologies.  The decree won’t affect Russian involvement in Iran’s
Bushehr nuclear power plant, a Kremlin spokesman said today by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
