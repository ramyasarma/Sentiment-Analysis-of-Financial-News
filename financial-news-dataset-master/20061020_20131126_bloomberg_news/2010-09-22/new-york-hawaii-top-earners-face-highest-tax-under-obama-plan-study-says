High-income residents of New York
City and President  Barack Obama ’s home state of Hawaii would
have the highest marginal tax rates in the U.S. if Congress
adopts the president’s proposal to increase taxes for top
earners, a  study  found.  The  Tax Foundation , a Washington research group that
advocates for lower taxes, said state, local and federal levies
would result in a top 50.8 percent rate on high-income New York
City residents. Affluent Hawaiians would pay 49.7 percent.
Residents of California, Vermont, Maryland and New York round
out the five states with the heaviest burdens, with top federal-
state rates of 49.4 percent, 48.8 percent, 48.6 percent and 48.4
percent, respectively.  “High-income taxpayers, along with second earners, tend to
be the most sensitive to higher marginal taxes,” said  Gerald Prante , the Tax Foundation economist who prepared the report.
“And as they keep getting higher and higher, the marginal cost
grows even faster.”  Lower tax rates on income and investments enacted in 2001
and 2003 expire Dec. 31. Obama and most Democrats want to retain
those that target individuals earning less than $200,000 and
married couples earning under $250,000 and allow policies that
benefited those with higher incomes to expire. Republicans
generally back extending all of the tax cuts. (To see an

33 percent and 35 percent to revert to 36 percent and 39.6
percent next year. Phase-outs for deductions and exemptions
would also be reinstated, pushing the rate higher. Tax rates on
dividends and capital gains would increase to 20 percent from 15
percent.  Under current law, the top federal tax rate applies only to
taxable income that exceeds about $375,000; amounts below that
are taxed at lower rates. Taxable income is equal to gross
income minus deductions, so most taxpayers wouldn’t begin paying
at top rates until they gross more than about $400,000.  The top marginal rates also don’t reflect the overall tax
the highest earners pay, especially when most of the income
comes from capital gains or dividends.  The 400 highest-earning U.S. households reported an average
of $345 million of income in 2007, while their average tax rate
fell to 16.6 percent, the lowest in almost 20 years.  $532 Tax Bill  Almost three-quarters of the highest earners’ income was in
capital gains and dividends taxed at a 15 percent rate set as
part of tax cuts backed by President  George W. Bush  in 2003,
Internal Revenue Service statistics show. Of the 400 earners,
289 paid a total effective federal tax rate of 20 percent or
less in 2007, the last year for which figures were available,
the data show.  Separately, IRS data shows 80 percent of those facing
higher taxes under Obama earn between $200,000 and $500,000. An
analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation in
August concluded their taxes would increase on average by $532 a
year.  The marginal tax rate rankings of states would be little
changed if Republicans prevail and all tax cuts are extended,
the Tax Foundation found. In that case, the top marginal rate in
New York City would be 45.3 percent; Hawaii, 44.3 percent;
California, 44.1 percent; Vermont, 43.3 percent; Maryland, 43.1
percent; New Jersey and New York, 43 percent.  Other states at the top under one or both scenarios include
Maine, Minnesota, Idaho, North Carolina and Ohio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
