Farhat Omer Bengdara , governor of
the Central Bank of Libya and deputy chairman of  UniCredit SpA ,
told Il Sole 24 Ore that Libyan investors are committed to
Unicredit.  “We wanted Chief Executive Oficer  Alessandro Profumo  to
keep his job but, to be clear, we bought shares of a bank not of
a manager,” Bengdara told the Italia daily.  Profumo resigned today after clashing with shareholders
over Libyan investments in the company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
