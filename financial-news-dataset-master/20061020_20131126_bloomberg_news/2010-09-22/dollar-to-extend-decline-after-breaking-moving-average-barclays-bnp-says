Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA and
Citigroup Inc. said the dollar may extend losses against the
euro after the Federal Reserve signaled it may implement further
easing measures and prompted the currency pair to trade above a
key technical level.  The euro surged past its 200-day moving average yesterday
for the first time since May 2009 after U.S. policy makers said
that they “will provide additional accommodation if needed” to
spur growth. A weekly close above the moving average could drive
the dollar to weaken to $1.4720 or $1.5145 per euro by the end
of the year, according to Citigroup, who said before the Fed’s
statement that the euro could fall to $1.22 or $1.26.  “The Fed being prepared to do something, a little bit
closer to engaging in new quantitative easing, that’s what’s
helping slide it through,” said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citigroup in New York. “Given how reliable
the 200-day moving average has been over the last four years,
having gotten that break now, the likelihood of that down move
taking place seems much lower.”  The dollar dropped 0.9 percent to 1.3379 per euro as of
1:14 p.m. in New York, after touching $1.3440, the lowest level
since April. The euro rose above its 200-day moving average of
$1.3214 yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee
released a statement at 2:15 p.m. following the conclusion of
its policy meeting.  Barclays, also citing a weekly close above the moving
average, said the euro may rally to $1.38 or $1.40. The firm in
August forecast the euro would end the year at $1.28, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moving Average  The 16-nation currency May rise to $1.40 by late October or
early November,  Andrew Chaveriat , a New York-based technical
analyst at BNP Paribas, said yesterday. The firm had previously
estimated that the euro would depreciation to $1.15 by the end
of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro last broke through the 200-day moving average
versus the dollar in May 2009, prompting a rally to $1.5144 in
November. When the currency pair broke below the moving average
in January, the euro tumbled to as low as $1.1877 in June.  The median forecast of 40 contributors surveyed by
Bloomberg News is for the euro to finish the year at $1.28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
