Duke University said its
investments rose 13 percent in the past year, beating gains of
Harvard University, the world’s richest school, and matching
returns of a broad group of institutions.  The endowment is still $1.2 billion short of what it was
two years ago, said  Richard Brodhead , the Durham, North
Carolina, school’s president, in an  e-mail  to staff today,
without disclosing current the value of the fund. The endowment
managed $6.1 billion as of June 30, 2008, according to its
 website . It was valued at $4.4 billion a year ago.  Duke cut 400 workers in the past year through early
retirement packages, by controlling overtime and not filling
vacant positions, Brodhead said. Freezing salaries helped save
more than 100 jobs, he said. That contributed to a reduction in
the budget deficit of more than $60 million.  In 2009, the university said it needed to cut its annual
budget of $2 billion by about $100 million over three years, to
make up for endowment losses. The school still needs to cut an
additional $40 million over the next two years, Brodhead said
today.  Gift-giving over the past year increased 15 percent to $345
million from last year’s low, said Brodhead.  Michael Schoenfeld , a spokesman for the university, didn’t
return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.  Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said Sept. 9 its
investments rose 11 percent in the past year, beating its own
benchmark while trailing the returns of a broad group of
institutions. The university’s endowment climbed $1.4 billion to
$27.4 billion as of June 30. Institutions tracked by Wilshire
Associates Inc., a consulting firm in Santa Monica, California,
had a 13 percent median gain over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
