U.S. stocks pared losses as gains
in commodity producers and utilities helped the market overcome
an early slump led by technology companies following a lower-
than-estimated sales forecast at Adobe Systems Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,136.65 at 2:43 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 0.7
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little
changed at 10,760.32, wiping out most of a 53-point decline.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
