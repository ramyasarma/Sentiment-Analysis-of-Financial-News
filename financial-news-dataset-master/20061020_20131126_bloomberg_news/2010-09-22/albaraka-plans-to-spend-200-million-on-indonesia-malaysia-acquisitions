Albaraka Banking Group BSC , the
biggest publicly traded Islamic lender in Bahrain, is looking to
buy banks in Malaysia and Indonesia and may spend as much as
$200 million on the deals, its chief executive officer said.  “We prefer to either start an Islamic bank or acquire an
Islamic bank,”  Adnan Ahmed Yousif  told reporters at a
conference in Dubai today. “We are seriously thinking of
acquisitions, according to our strategy, in Indonesia as well as
Malaysia.”  Yousif said the bank had held discussions with Bank
Muamalat Malaysia Bhd about buying a stake, but has been unable
to reach a deal. Asia-focused bank  Standard Chartered Plc  is
advising Albaraka on the Malaysia acquisition while it is
holding meetings about a buyout in Indonesia alone.  Albaraka this year acquired Pakistan’s Emirates Global
Islamic Bank Ltd., which boosted its network in the country to
about 90 branches. It also began operations in Syria this year.  Albaraka expects to raise $200 million from the sale of
Islamic bonds before the end of the year, using London-based
Standard Chartered as one of the managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
