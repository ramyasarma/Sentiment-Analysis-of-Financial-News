Portuguese 10-year bonds rose after
the nation sold 750 million euros ($1 billion) of bonds due in
2014 and 2020, the minimum amount planned, at an auction of
securities today.  The Portuguese 10-year bond yield fell 9 basis points to
6.25 percent as of 11:08 a.m. in London, leaving the difference
in yield, or  spread , with German bunds little changed at 385
basis points. It reached 398 basis points earlier today.  “The auction seems to have been taken down without too
much difficulty after the wider spreads provided an
opportunity,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh
at RIA Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and money
managers. “It’s slightly disappointing they didn’t manage” to
sell the maximum intended amount of 1 billion euros, he said.
“Until we see an improvement in the fiscal position, it’s
difficult to see the spread narrowing significantly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
