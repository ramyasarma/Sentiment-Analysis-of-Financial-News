Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad said resuming diplomatic relations with the U.S.
wouldn’t be difficult, according to a report on his website
today.  “I feel the conditions are easy,” Ahmadinejad said in a
video conference with U.S. academics, in response to a question
on whether Iran and the U.S. could open embassies in each
others’ capitals. “The U.S. government should respect the
Iranian people and accept equal conditions in relations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
