Britain’s 100 biggest law firms
increased their quarterly revenue by an average of 5 percent
amid continued “uncertainty” about the economy, according to a
survey.  The “modest” boost was due to higher rates and more
billable hours over the three-month period that ended July 31,
compared with a year earlier, accounting firm Deloitte LLP said
in a statement. The U.K.’s 10 biggest firms, including the top-
five “Magic Circle” firms led by  Clifford Chance LLP , had
smaller average increases of 3.7 percent, Deloitte said.  “The general uncertainty over the economy means that for
many firms there is a considerable degree of nervousness as to
how the rest of the year will pan out,” Jeremy Black, a partner
at Deloitte in London, said in the statement.  London’s biggest firms have faced a decline in business
over the past year as the volume of buyouts and mergers fell 32
percent in 2009 and remained at a low level this year, according
to Bloomberg data. Annual earnings reported in July by the law
firms showed London’s largest firms suffered revenue declines of
as much as 11 percent.  Clifford Chance regained its spot as the highest-grossing
U.K. law firm, even as its revenue fell 5 percent to 1.197
billion pounds ($1.88 billion) for the fiscal year ended April
30, according to data released by the firm.  Linklaters LLP  was
second with 1.18 billion pounds, after an 8.8 percent decline
from the prior year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
