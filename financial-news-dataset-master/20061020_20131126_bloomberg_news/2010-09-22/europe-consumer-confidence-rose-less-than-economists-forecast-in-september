European  consumer confidence 
improved less than economists forecast in September, adding to
signs the region’s recovery is losing momentum.  An index of  consumer sentiment  in the 16-nation euro region
rose to minus 11.2 from a revised minus 11.4 in August, the
Brussels-based European Commission said today in an initial
estimate. Economists had forecast a reading of minus 10, the
median of  19 estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Europe’s economy is slowing as global growth cools and
governments from Ireland to Spain step up spending cuts to rein
in their budget deficits. German  investor confidence  fell this
month and the European Union said last week that the region’s
rate of expansion probably halved in the current quarter.  The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
data, trading at $1.3420 at 3:04 p.m. in London, up 1.2 percent
on the day. The dollar weakened on speculation the Federal
Reserve’s willingness to ease monetary policy further will damp
demand for U.S. assets.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area  economic confidence , which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
