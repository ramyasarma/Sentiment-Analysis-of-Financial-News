Romania’s parliament condemned the
expulsion of Roma from France and other European states,
describing it as a “serious violation” of European Union
directives and human rights.  The legislators said expelling the Roma, as gypsies from
Eastern Europe are known, violates “the right of free movement
for all European citizens regardless of nationality or race,”
according to an e-mailed statement today.  France’s policy has been denounced by the European
Parliament, the Catholic Church and editorials in newspapers
such as Le Monde, the Financial Times and the New York Times. EU
Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  compared the dismantling of
illegal camps to events during World War II, though she later
apologized for doing so.  French police were sent into the camps in July after
travelers went on a rampage in central France. The riot was in
response to a killing by a policeman during an identity check.
More than 500 illegal camps have been dismantled in France since
then, President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said recently.  The Romanian parliament requested President  Traian Basescu 
and the government to “take all the political and diplomatic
measures needed for protecting the rights of Romanian nationals
as European citizens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
