Belgian  business confidence 
unexpectedly improved for a third month in September, led by
business-related services.  The confidence index for Belgium, the sixth-largest economy
in the euro region, rose to minus 3.4 from minus 5.1 in August,
the  National Bank of Belgium  in Brussels said today in an e-
mailed statement. That’s above the minus 5.1 reading projected
by economists, according to the median of 10 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The increase was most marked in business-related
services, bolstered in particular by a substantially more
optimistic outlook for the activity of firms,” the central bank
said in today’s report.  The European economy is showing mixed signals on the
recovery. Euro-area  industrial orders  declined more than
economists forecast in July, data showed today.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy and one of Belgium’s
biggest trading partners,  business sentiment  is forecast to fall
in September after an unexpected increase in the previous month.
The Ifo institute’s business climate  index , based on a survey of
7,000 executives, probably decreased to 106.4 from 106.7,
according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The Munich-based Ifo is scheduled to publish the indicator
at 10 a.m. on Sept. 24.  Belgium faces political uncertainty until a new government
is formed following inconclusive elections in June. Three years
ago, government formation took a record nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
