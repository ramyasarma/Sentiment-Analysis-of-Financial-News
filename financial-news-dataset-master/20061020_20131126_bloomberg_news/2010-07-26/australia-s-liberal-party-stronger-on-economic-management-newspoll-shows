coalition is seen as stronger than the ruling Labor party on
economic management issues, a Newspoll opinion survey shows. The
coalition has 47 percent support on the economy, compared with
35 percent who favor the government, according to a telephone
survey of 1,136 people conducted between July 23 and 25 and
published in the Australian newspaper. The coalition also leads
on national security and asylum seekers, while Labor is ahead on
health, education, industrial relations and climate change. The
margin of error is 3 percentage points
