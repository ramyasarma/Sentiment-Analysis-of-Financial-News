             Hungarian  retail sales  declined for
a 40th consecutive month in May, led by a slump in fuel
consumption.  
 Annual sales fell 4.7 percent from a year earlier after a 5
percent drop in April, the Budapest-based  statistics office  said
in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of six
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.8 percent. Sales dropped
0.5 percent from March, the steepest monthly decline since
October.  
 Turnover at filling stations fell 11.7 percent, according
to the release.
