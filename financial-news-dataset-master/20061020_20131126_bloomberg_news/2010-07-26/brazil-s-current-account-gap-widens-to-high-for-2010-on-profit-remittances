             Brazil’s 12-month current account
gap widened to the highest on record in June on steeper profit
remittances by multinationals and increased spending by
Brazilians abroad.  
 The deficit in the  current account , the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, rose to $5.18 billion in June after
a revised $1.99 billion gap in May, the central bank said today.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a $3.2 billion June
deficit, according to the median of 14 forecasts.  
 “Some of the numbers are deteriorating sharply for Brazil,
including the external accounts,”  Win Thin , senior currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to
clients today. He added that the moves could “help limit” the
rise of the real.  
 Bank policy makers last week slowed the pace of interest
rate  increases  amid signs that the expansion of Latin America’s
biggest  economy  is decelerating after it grew at the fastest
pace since 1995 in the first quarter. In a weekly central bank
survey taken July 23 and published today, economists held their
forecast for gross domestic product growth this year at 7.2
percent.  
 Brazil’s current account gap  accumulated  over 12 months
rose to $40.9 billion in June from $36.3 billion in May, the
central bank said. As a percentage of GDP, the deficit widened
to 2.13 percent in June from 1.94 percent in May, the worst
result since September 2002, when it was 2.56 percent, the bank
said.  
 ‘Rolling Well’  
 Brazil’s economy “is still rolling well, so you have
greater spending with trips, bigger remittances of profits and a
worse trade balance,”  Silvio Campos Neto , chief economist at
Banco Schahin SA, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  
 The current account gap may shrink to $3.7 billion this
month before reaching a record $49 billion this year,  Altamir Lopes , head of central bank’s economic department told reporters
in Brasilia today.  
 Brazil received $708 million in foreign  direct investment 
in June, the lowest since 2005, the bank said. That was less
than the $1.6 billion median forecast of 10 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  
 In the first half of 2010, FDI totaled $12.1 billion, the
bank said, which Lopes said was less than the bank expected.
After taking in $1.6 billion since July 1, Brazil may end July
with $2 billion in FDI, Lopes said. The central bank forecasts
FDI of $38 billion this year.  
 ‘Positive Inflow’  
 “On average, foreign direct investment is still below what
we’ve expected, but we keep forecasting a very positive inflow
in the second half. There’s no problem in financing the current
account gap,” Lopes said.  
 The country’s  trade surplus  fell 33.86 percent in June as
imports rose and exports fell, the Trade Ministry said July 1.
Remittances rose 37.4 percent in June to $4.8 billion, the
central bank said today.  
 Campos Neto said that the expanding current account gap
could help slow the Brazilian real’s rally against the dollar.  
 The figures “can take away some of the enthusiasm about
the appreciation of the real,” he said.  
 The real rose 0.64 percent to 1.7624 per dollar today from
1.7738 on July 23.  
 Yields on the interest-rate future contract due January
2011, the most traded on Sao Paulo’s BM&F exchange, fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.89 percent.
