             European Union governments will
impose fresh sanctions on Iran today in an effort to force the
regime to halt uranium enrichment, Cypriot Foreign Minister
Markos Kyprianou said.  
 “The decision has been taken to move ahead with sanctions,
mostly based on the Security Council resolution, some
accompanying measures,” Kyprianou told reporters before a
meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels today.  
 While Cyprus preferred not to go beyond the United Nations
resolution, “this is a political message and the decision was
taken to send it,” Kyprianou said.
