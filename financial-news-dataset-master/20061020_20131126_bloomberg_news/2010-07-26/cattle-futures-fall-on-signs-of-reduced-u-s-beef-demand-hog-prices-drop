             Cattle futures fell to a one-week
low on speculation that slumping beef prices signal shrinking
U.S. demand. Hogs also declined.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  dropped to a one-week low at $1.546 a
pound at midday. On July 23, processors  shipped  3.02 million
pounds (1,370 metric tons), the lowest amount in three weeks,
government data show. Demand tends to slow in late July and
early August as summer temperatures peak and fewer people grill
outdoors, analysts said.  
 “We are in the dog days of summer, as they say, and that
limits demand,” said  Paul Georgy , the president of Allendale
Inc., a broker in McHenry, Illinois. “A lot of people take
vacations this time of year.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.9 cent, or 1
percent, to 93.825 cents a pound at 11:34 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 93.75 cents, the
lowest level since July 19.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.175 cent
to $1.15 a pound.  
 A U.S. Department of Agriculture report showing that
feedlots last month bought fewer young animals than estimated
may have kept futures from falling further. Feedlots boosted
cattle purchases by 17 percent last month to 1.628 million head,
less than the 19 percent jump forecast by analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 ‘Decent Number’  
 “The cattle-on-feed report came out with a decent number
that was a little better than people were looking for,” said
 Parker McMahan , a senior account executive at Price Futures
Group in Chicago. “There’s been a substantial amount of risk in
holding a big herd of cattle over the last couple of years, and
any producer is trying to play it close to the vest.”  
 The beef-cow herd on July 1 was the smallest since at least
1973 after farmers lost money the past two years. The USDA
issued the data on July 23 after livestock markets closed in
Chicago.  
 Hog futures for October settlement fell 1.325 cents, or 1.7
percent, to 75.7 cents a pound. Last week, the most-active
contract climbed 1.8 percent, the first increase since June.  
 Gains in futures may have been exaggerated because
wholesale pork and spot-market hogs declined on July 23, said
 Tom Cawthorne , the director of hog marketing at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago.  
 Wholesale pork  fell 0.3 percent to 85.26 cents a pound, the
first drop in five days, and the price of hogs for  immediate
delivery  to slaughterhouses slid 1.6 percent.  
 “We maybe got a little ahead of ourselves with the
rally,” Cawthorne said.
