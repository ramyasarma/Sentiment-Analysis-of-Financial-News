             The European Commission said today
it had decided to initiate formal antitrust investigations
against International Business Machines Corp. in two separate
cases of alleged infringements of EU antitrust rules related to
the abuse of a dominant market position. The commission, the
EU’s executive branch in Brussels, released an e-mailed
statement on the probe. “Both cases are related to IBM’s 
conduct on the market for mainframe computers,” according to 
the commission’s statement.
