             Palm oil dropped for a second day
after crude oil fell on speculation that the global economic
recovery may stall, reducing the appeal of the vegetable oil as
biodiesel feedstock.  
 October-delivery futures fell 1 percent to 2,473 ringgit
($774) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in
Kuala Lumpur, erasing gains on as much as 1.1 percent during
intra-day trade.  
 “Palm oil is following crude, which is falling as concerns
persists about the global economic recovery,” said  Ivy Ng , an
analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “It’s quite natural that
some traders will be looking to take profit after the last two
weeks’ rally.”  
 Palm oil climbed 8.6 percent in the past two weeks on
speculation demand may increase among Asian countries and as
weather threatens to disrupt output in the biggest producers of
the tropical commodity. The commodity may average 2,500 ringgit
this year, CIMB Investment’s Ng said.  
 “Palm oil’s direction from now will be tied to crude oil
and the outlook for weather for the U.S. soybean crop,” Ng said.
“A bit of the risk premium due to the weather disruption in the
palm-growing region is already priced in.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery declined as much as 0.7
percent to $78.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and traded at $78.57 at 6:03 p.m. Singapore time.  
 Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 4.1 percent in the first
25 days of July to 1,074,329 tons from 1,120,563 tons in the
same period in June, independent market surveyor Intertek said.
Exports dropped 0.9 percent to 1,103,439 tons, surveyor Societe
Generale de Surveillance said.  
 La Nina  
 Futures gained 1.1 percent intraday on concern that the La
Nina weather event may disrupt harvests in the biggest producers
of the commodity later this year and after a report said exports
from Indonesia, the world’s biggest grower, gained in June.  
 Indonesia’s exports rose 9 percent in June, gaining for a
second month, as buyers sought to rebuild inventories ahead of a
Muslim festival, according to an industry group. Shipments rose
to 1.13 million tons from 1.04 million tons in May, the nation’s
palm oil association said on July 24. Sales to India, the top
biggest buyer, jumped 45 percent to 476,030 tons, said Gapki, as
the group is known.  
 China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia mark important
festivals in the quarter ending September, with communal meals
stoking edible oils consumption. Malaysia’s exports increased
5.5 percent to 1.44 million tons in June, beating estimates by
cargo surveyors Intertek and Societe Generale de Surveillance.  
 December-delivery soybean oil fell 0.3 percent to 39.65
cents and the vegetable oil’s  premium  over palm oil widened to
98.23 a ton from $95.08 on July 23, according to Bloomberg data.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, rose 1.1 percent to $786 a ton.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
jumped 0.7 percent to 6,674 yuan ($984) a ton, while soybean oil
advanced 0.3 percent to 7,648 yuan a ton.
