             The dollar declined against all of
its major counterparts as a bigger-than-forecast increase in
U.S. new home sales in June and a boost in FedEx Corp.’s
earnings prospects made riskier assets more attractive.  
 Sterling rose to a three-month high against the dollar
after the U.K.’s major banks passed European Union stress tests.
The dollar dropped for a third day against the euro on reduced
demand for the greenback as a refuge.  
 “We’re seeing some risk as the equity markets are up,
which is positive for the euro,” said  Brian Taylor , chief
currency trader a Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. in Buffalo,
New York. “Data is coming in decently.”  
 The dollar depreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2991 per euro at
4:21 p.m. in New York, from $1.2909 at the end of last week. The
shared currency traded within a cent of the 10-week high of
$1.3029 reached July 20. The euro was at 112.82 yen, compared
with 112.90, after reaching 113.48, the highest level since June
3. The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 86.86 yen, from 87.46.  
 South African’s rand gained as much as 1.3 percent to
7.3407 per dollar and the New Zealand currency advanced as much
as 1.1 percent to the six-month high of 73.55 U.S. cents as the
rally in U.S. stocks spurred demand for currencies linked to
global economic growth.  
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased its 2010  decline ,
advancing 1 percent on the U.S. housing data and FedEx’s profit
outlook, while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 1.1
percent.  
 Home Sales  
 New U.S. home purchases increased 24 percent from May to an
 annual pace  of 330,000, the Commerce Department said. The rate
was the second-lowest in data going back to 1963 after May’s
267,000 pace. The median forecast of 73 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an advance of 3.3 percent.  
 FedEx, the second-largest U.S. package-shipping company,
raised its earnings forecast for this quarter and the full year
on improving demand for express and ground deliveries.  
 The pound advanced as much as 0.6 percent to $1.5520, the
highest level since April 15, after the Financial Services
Authority said on July 23 in an e-mailed statement that HSBC
Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc passed the European bank stress
tests. Sterling later rose 0.4 percent to $1.5485.  
 Germany’s Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of
Greece SA and five Spanish savings banks were the only financial
institutions of the 91 tested that didn’t have adequate reserves
to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said.  
 Euro Forecasts  
 The combination of growing confidence in Europe’s economy
and evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. is driving euro bears
into hiding.  
 After tracking the euro’s slide from about $1.45 at the
beginning of 2010, the median forecast of currency strategists
has stayed within two cents of $1.20 since the start of June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. raised their estimates in the past
two weeks, joining HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG in predicting a
stronger euro.  
 “The market is still skeptical over the upcoming U.S.
economy,” said  Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a senior currency trader
at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York.  
 Foreign-exchange trading jumped during April compared with
October as Europe’s debt crisis boosted trading, central banks
said in semi-annual surveys posted on their websites.  
 Average Daily Volume  
 The data indicate the currency market expanded to more than
$4.1 trillion in daily trading from $3.2 trillion in 2007,  Mark McDonald , an analyst at HSBC in London, wrote in a note to
clients. Average U.S. daily volume in foreign-exchange
instruments was $754 billion in the April survey, an increase of
12 percent from October, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
said. Trading accelerated 15 percent to $1.75 trillion in the
U.K. during the same period.  
 Australia’s dollar touched its strongest level in two
months versus the U.S. currency before a report this week
forecast to show inflation accelerated.  
 The Reserve Bank of Australia said last week in minutes of
its July meeting that it intends to use results of Europe’s
stress tests and local inflation figures in deciding whether to
resume raising interest rates when they meet next month.  
 The Aussie gained 0.8 percent to 90.31 U.S. cents, from
89.57 cents, after earlier reaching 90.36 cents, matching the
level reached on May 11.
