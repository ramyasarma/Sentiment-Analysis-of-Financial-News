             Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. will get
a capital boost from the Slovenian government or a strategic
partner after European Union stress tests showed Slovenia’s
biggest lender needs to raise fresh funds.  
 “It’s now clear Nova Ljubljanska needs a recapitalization
and the money will come either from the government, that is
taxpayers, or from a strategic partner,”  Borut Pahor ,
Slovenia’s Prime Minister, told reporters in Ljubljana today.
“The state will lower its holding in NLB to have just a
controlling stake.”  
 Nova Ljubljanska passed the EU scrutiny on July 23, which
showed its tier 1 capital ratio would fall to 6.3 percent by the
end of 2011 in case of a recession and a sovereign debt crisis.
The bank, based in Ljubljana, will ask shareholders in September
for a 400 million euro ($517 million) capital increase.  
 The Slovenian bank, which focuses its business in the
Balkans, needs 600 million euros to repay liabilities in the
next three years. The government and Belgium’s  KBC Groep NV  are
the bank’s largest investors with each owning about a third.  
 Slovenian governments have sought to team up NLB with a
larger strategic partner after KBC, which bought its stake in
2002, said it wants to dispose of the investment.
