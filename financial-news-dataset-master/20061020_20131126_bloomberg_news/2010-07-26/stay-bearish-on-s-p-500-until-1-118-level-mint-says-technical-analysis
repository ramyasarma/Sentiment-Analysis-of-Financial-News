             Investors should remain bearish on
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  until the benchmark gauge for
U.S. equities rises above the 1,118 level, according to the head
of technical research at Mint Equities Ltd.  
 The S&P 500 closed July 23 at 1,102.66, near to the zone
defined by two resistance level at 1,114 and 1,118, according to
Mint’s  Geoff Wilkinson . This represents the “last line of
defense” before a rally can occur, he said. The measure surged
3.6 percent last week to the highest level since June 21 as
companies from United Parcel Service Inc. to Apple Inc. and Ford
Motor Co. posted better-than-estimated earnings.  
 “We quite clearly have pushed on to close at ‘new’ highs
above the mid-July highs,” said London-based Wilkinson. “This
should now reverse in function to provide some initial support
going forward. We will persist with a tactical short bias until
these levels are breached.”  
 The S&P 500 is headed for its biggest monthly increase
since July 2009, having so far climbed 7 percent. Of the 151
companies that have reported quarterly  results  since July 12, 83
percent have beaten analysts’ estimates for per-share earnings,
according to Bloomberg data.
