             Copper may rise for a sixth day in
New York, the longest winning streak in more than a month, after
inventories resumed their contraction, signaling steady demand.  
 Stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange slid today
after rising on July 23 for the first time in 26 sessions.
Copper added as much as 0.8 percent today before paring the gain
as the dollar rebounded and Treasuries climbed. The U.S.
currency had slipped after results of stress tests on European
banks showed that most lenders passed.  
 “Risk appetite remains choppy as the market digests the
impact of the euro-area bank stress test,” said  Daniel Major ,
an analyst at RBS Global Banking & Markets in London.  
 Copper for September delivery gained 0.1 cent to $3.186 a
pound at 7:56 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The most-active
contract erased a drop of as much as 0.6 percent. Copper for
delivery in three months climbed 0.1 percent to $7,035 a metric
ton on the LME.  
 London copper has dropped 4.6 percent this year, partly on
speculation about the effect of steps taken by China’s
government to restrain the nation’s surging economy. Gross
domestic product expanded more slowly in the second quarter and
inflation cooled in June, according to figures released this
month. China is the world’s largest copper consumer.  
 Chinese Demand  
 “The monetary measures implemented in China should lead to
a cool-down in economic activity, and therefore metal demand,”
said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “This should weigh on prices.”  
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, dropped 0.2 percent after gaining as much
as 0.2 percent. A weaker dollar makes metals priced in the
currency cheaper in terms of other monies. The index has
retreated for seven weeks in a row, cutting this year’s climb to
5.7 percent.  
 Stockpiles of copper in warehouses monitored by the LME
dropped 0.8 percent to 416,275 tons, the lowest level since Nov.
18, exchange figures showed today.  Inventories  are down 17
percent this year and headed for the first annual drop since
2004.  Bookings  to remove copper from LME warehouses fell 11
percent to 33,525 tons.  
 Tin for three-month delivery on the LME dropped 0.7 percent
to $19,350 a ton after reaching the highest intraday price since
September 2008 in the prior session. Stockpiles tracked by the
LME dropped 1.6 percent to 15,370 tons today, the least since
June 8, 2009. Bookings to remove metal from LME warehouses fell
16 percent to 1,130 tons.  
 Aluminum, Lead  
 A sole party controlled between 50 percent and 79 percent
of available LME tin inventories as of July 21, according to
exchange figures. Two parties held between 30 percent and 39
percent of stockpiles as of the following day, the latest LME
data show.  
 Aluminum rose 0.7 percent to $2,045 a ton. World
inventories of unwrought metal shrank to 1.19 million tons in
June from 1.3 million tons in May, the International Aluminium
Institute said in a report.  
 Lead was little changed at $1,978 a ton, nickel climbed 1
percent to $20,560 a ton and zinc added 0.9 percent to $1,923 a
ton.
