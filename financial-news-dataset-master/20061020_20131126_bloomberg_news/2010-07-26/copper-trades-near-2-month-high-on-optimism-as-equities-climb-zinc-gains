             Copper traded near the highest level
in more than two months as a gain in equities boosted optimism
that the global economy is recovering.  
 Copper for three-month delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent
to $7,088 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
little changed at $7,020.50 at 4:44 p.m. in Shanghai. The metal
last week posted the biggest weekly gain since February,
reaching $7,090 a ton, the highest intraday price since May 14.
Zinc jumped 1.4 percent to $1,933.50 a ton.  
 Asian  stocks  rose to a one-month high, China equities
advanced for a sixth day, and U.S. equities rallied last week on
corporate profit reports. The euro advanced and the dollar
declined as European bank stress tests showed that 84 of 91
lenders passed the examination, easing concern about the health
of the region’s financial system.  
 “Copper is moving in a narrow range after making a
breakthrough last week on good news from Europe and the U.S.,”
Guo Yong, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co., said from Shenzhen
today.  
 Of the 149 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported
earnings since July 12, about 85 percent have beaten forecasts
for earnings per share, according to Bloomberg data. Fewer than
70 percent have topped sales estimates, the data show.  
 “Equities will continue to guide the way for metals” this
week,  Tan Wentao , an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said
from Shanghai.  
 Metals also rose as the China Securities Journal reported
China will limit production of 10 kinds of non-ferrous metals to
a combined annual output of 41 million tons by 2015. The
Chinese-language paper cited  Shang Fushan , vice chairman of the
China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.  
 Copper for October delivery in Shanghai added 0.3 percent
to 55,570 yuan ($8,196) a ton. Aluminum in London advanced 0.9
percent to $2,049 a ton, lead was little changed at $1,978 a ton,
tin added 0.3 percent to $19,550 a ton, and nickel increased 1.1
percent to $20,571 a ton.
