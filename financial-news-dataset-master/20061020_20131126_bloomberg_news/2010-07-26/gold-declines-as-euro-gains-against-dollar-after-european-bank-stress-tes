             Gold fell for the second straight
session as the euro climbed against the dollar, eroding demand
for the metal as a haven amid waning European-debt concerns.
Platinum rose to the highest level in almost four weeks.  
 Most European banks passed stress tests designed to show
their ability to withstand a financial crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23. The euro gained for the third
straight session against the U.S. currency. Gold has dropped 6.6
percent from the June 21 record of $1,266.50 an ounce. The metal
priced in euros also reached an all-time high last month.  
 “There are no horror stories out of Europe at the moment,
so gold is in a holding pattern,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The traders are quick to
take their profits and just as quick to get back in.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery fell $4.70, or 0.4
percent, to $1,183.10 on the Comex in New York. The metal was
little changed last week.  
 Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, advised clients to reduce
holdings of gold to an “insurance” position. Gartman had
advocated selling euros and buying gold earlier this year as
some European countries struggled with budget deficits.  
 “Those who wish to hold their gold positions, against our
wishes, should keep a very wary eye on the euro,” Gartman said
in his newsletter.  
 Gold may trade from $1,175 to $1,205 this week, said
 Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois.  
 ‘Locked In Range’  
 “Gold seems to be locked in a trading range, and it’s been
here for weeks,” Kaplan said.  
 Platinum rose amid supply concerns. In South Africa, Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd., the world’s second-largest producer, may
face a strike by 18,000 workers after talks to resolve a pay
dispute failed, the National Union of Mineworkers said.  
 Members will vote tomorrow on whether to strike, said
Lesiba Seshoka, a union spokesman.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $13, or 0.8
percent, to $1,555.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the metal reached $1,559.80, the highest
level since June 29.  
 Anglo Platinum Ltd. is the world’s biggest producer.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $8.25, or
1.8 percent, to $475 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $479,
the highest level since June 28.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 9.9 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $18.20 an ounce on the Comex.
