             Japan’s  bonds  rose as a sale of two-
year notes drew the highest demand in five years amid
speculation the central bank will keep interest rates near zero.  
 Longer-maturity debt led gains, with 30-year  yields  falling
to the lowest level since December 2008, after a Bank of Japan
report showed  prices  for corporate services dropped for a 21st
month. Today’s 2.6 trillion yen ($29.9 billion) auction of two-
year securities drew bids for 5.67 times the amount of offer,
the  highest  bid-to-cover since June 2005.  
 “With an interest-rate hike unlikely for the next two
years, there are funds that have no destination but bonds,”
said  Chotaro Morita , chief strategist at Barclays Capital Japan
Ltd. in Tokyo. “Potential demand for bonds is still strong.”  
 The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell one basis
point to 1.05 percent as of 3:58 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.1 percent security maturing in June 2020 gained 0.089 yen to
100.447 yen.  
 The 30-year yield slid two basis points to 1.785 percent.
Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained for a second
day, rising 0.12 to 141.86 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  
 The Bank of Japan said its corporate services price index
slid 1 percent in June from a year earlier, after dropping a 0.8
percent the previous month. The central bank, which has been
grappling with deflation for 12 years,  said  last month the gauge
responds to the economic cycle more sensitively than other
similar indexes.  
 Deflation Signs  
 Japanese  consumer prices  excluding fresh food fell 1.1
percent year-on-year in June, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists before the July 30 report. Deflation, or a drop in
general price levels, enhances the value of the fixed payments
from debt.  
 The difference in yield between 2-year and 20-year bonds
shrank to 160.5 basis points from 165 basis points at the end of
last week. The  spread  was 202.5 basis points on March 18.  
 Two-year yields tend to central bank interest rates, while
longer-maturity bonds are more influenced by the outlook for
inflation.  
 Japanese banks are turning to longer-maturity debt and the
swap market to capture profits as yields on their preferred
five-year securities languish near a seven-year low, said
 Tokuyoshi Takano , a financial-derivatives manager at Mitsui
Sumitomo Insurance Co.  
 Lenders are buying 10-year government bonds and making
fixed payments on interest-rate swaps in exchange for six-month
Libor, the London interbank offered rate, he said.
