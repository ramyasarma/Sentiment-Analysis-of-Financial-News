             Hynix Semiconductor Inc.  creditors
are offering to sell 24.4 million shares of the world’s second-
largest maker of computer-memory chips, according to an e-mail
sent to investors by the sale arrangers.  
 Creditors are seeking to sell the 4.1 percent stake at
between 23,200 won and 23,950 won a share, or a discount of as
much as 3.1 percent to today’s  closing price , according to the
e-mail. The sale will raise between $475 million and $491
million, according to the e-mail.  
 The group of nine financial institutions, which is seeking
to recoup the $4.6 billion spent on bailing out Ichon, South
Korea-based Hynix, will own 15 percent of the company after the
sale. The group has had difficulties in finding a strategic
buyer for their shareholding.  
 Creditors sold a 6.7 percent  stake  in Hynix for 923.2
billion ($777 million) won in March after three failed attempts
to sell their whole stake. They have said they’ll continue
looking for a strategic purchaser.  
 Hynix  rose 3 percent to close at 23,950 won in Seoul
trading. The stock has added 3.5 percent this year, compared
with a 5.1 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi stock index.  
 Hynix last week reported operating profit and sales that
beat analysts’ estimates as demand for personal computers and a
shortage of the chips drove up prices. Second-quarter  operating
profit  was a record 1.05 trillion won, compared with a loss of
211 billion won a year earlier. Revenue rose 96 percent to a
record 3.28 trillion won.  
 Nomura Holdings Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Woori
Investment & Securities Co. and Shinhan Investment Corp. are
arranging the sale.
