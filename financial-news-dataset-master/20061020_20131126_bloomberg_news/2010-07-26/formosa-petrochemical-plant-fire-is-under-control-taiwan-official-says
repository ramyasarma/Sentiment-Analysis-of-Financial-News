             A fire at  Formosa Petrochemical
Corp. ’s Mailiao refining complex in Western Taiwan has been
brought under control, an official from the local county
government said.  
 Dark smoke continues to rise from the scene of the fire,
Hsieh I-lin, a duty official at the Yunlin County fire
department, said by phone today.  
 The fire broke out at a residue desulfurization unit at
7:58 p.m. yesterday, the company said in a stock exchange filing
today. No-one was injured in the blaze, said Formosa
Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner.  
 Formosa Petrochemical’s refinery in Mailiao can process
540,000 barrels of crude oil a day. The company operates three
ethylene  plants  with a combined annual capacity of 2.935 million
metric tons. Ethylene is a raw material for plastics, chemicals
and synthetic fibers. A residue desulfurization unit removes
sulfur from residual fuel.  
 Formosa Petrochemical halted its No. 1 ethylene plant,
which has an annual capacity of 700,000 tons, at the Mailiao
complex on July 7 after a fire, according to company spokesman
 Lin Keh-yen .
