             China’s stocks rose for a sixth day
as the results of European banks’ stress tests eased concerns
about the region’s debt crisis and brokerages predicted further
gains for equities on valuations and possible easing of policy.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4 percent to 2,581.36
at 10:06 a.m. local time. The gains were led by copper producers
after Morgan Stanley said the metal was “primed” for a rally.
