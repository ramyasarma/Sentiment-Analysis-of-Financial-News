             Canada today will set unilateral
sanctions against Iran, joining a campaign by Western nations to
pressure the Middle East nation to halt its nuclear weapons
program, the Globe and Mail reported.  
 The measures will be announced by Foreign Affairs Minister
Lawrence Cannon and will surpass international sanctions adopted
by the United Nations, the newspaper said.  
 They will include a ban on Canadian investment in Iran’s oil
and gas industries and restrictions on exporting items that
might be used for nuclear programs, the Globe reported.  
 Iranian banks also will be barred from opening branches in
Canada and Canadian banks won’t be able to open offices in Iran,
the newspaper said.
