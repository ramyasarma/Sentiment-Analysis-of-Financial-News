             Eisai Co.  gained the most in 18
months in Tokyo trading after winning U.S. regulatory approval
to sell a higher-dose version of Aricept, the world’s
bestselling treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.  
 Eisai  jumped as much as 5.1 percent to 2,920 yen in
intraday trade, its steepest gain since Jan. 22, 2009. The stock
was at 2,901 yen at 10:31 a.m. local time, paring its loss this
year to 15 percent, compared with a 9.5 percent decline on the
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average .  
 The  Food and Drug Administration ’s approval on July 23 of a
23-milligram once-daily tablet will help Tokyo-based Eisai and
partner  Pfizer Inc.  of New York counter a potential fall in
sales once the drug faces competition from lower-cost generic
copies of a 10-milligram pill.  
 Aricept generated about $3.7 billion for Eisai in the last
fiscal year, 60 percent of which came from the U.S., the world’s
largest drug market. New forms of the treatment, including the
higher dose and a skin-patch formulation, will help maintain U.S.
 sales  at half of current levels after patent protection expires
in November, Eisai said in March.  
 “Aricept is a key earnings pillar,”  Fumiyoshi Sakai , a
health-care analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo, wrote in
a note to clients today. “With the November 2010 patent
expiration set to open the way for generic competition, Eisai
had been keenly pursuing approval for a higher-dose
formulation.”  
 Sakai said the FDA’s approval should boost Eisai’s stock
price, which had plunged 18 percent in 2010 before the
announcement. He reiterated an “outperform”  rating  on the
shares, which he expects to reach 3,800 yen within 12 months.  
 As many as 5.1 million Americans may have  Alzheimer’s , the
most common form of dementia in older people, according to the
U.S. National Institutes of Health. While there’s no cure for
the disease, drugs such as Aricept can ease the symptoms.  
 Brain Function  
 Patients who switched to the higher-dose Aricept were more
likely to maintain or improve brain function than those who
continued using the existing formulation, according to a study
released July 15. People with more advanced stages of the
disease benefited the most from the 23-milligram pill, compared
with the lower dose tablet currently used, the data showed.  
 “Eisai faces a narrow window to migrate as many of its
current Aricept users to the new formulation before the patent
expires in November,” MF Global FXA Securities Ltd. said in a
July 21 report.
