             India will seek to raise as much as
9.6 billion rupees ($204 million) from a sale of shares in
 Engineers India Ltd.  as part of a record sell-off of state
assets.  
 The government will offer the shares starting tomorrow for
270 rupees to 290 rupees apiece, with a 5 percent discount for
employees and retail buyers, according to an advertisement in
the Financial Express newspaper today. ICICI Securities Ltd.,
HSBC Securities & Capital Markets (India) Pvt.,  IDFC Capital Ltd. 
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. are managing the sale.  
 India aims to tap investors’ appetite for the South Asian
nation’s equities after companies there raised more than 654
billion rupees from shares sales this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, putting the market on course to exceed
2008’s record 782 billion rupees. The government plans to raise
400 billion rupees from share sales in the year ending March 31.  
 Shares of state-owned  Engineers India  fell 9.6 percent to
305.85 rupees as of 9:09 a.m. local time in Mumbai trading today.
That curbs the stock’s gains this year to 18 percent, surpassing
the 3.8 percent advance in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  
 India plans to sell about 33.7 million shares, or a 10
percent stake in the New Delhi-based company, in an offering
that ends July 30, according to the advertisement. The firm
provides design, engineering and construction services mainly to
oil, gas and petrochemicals companies.
