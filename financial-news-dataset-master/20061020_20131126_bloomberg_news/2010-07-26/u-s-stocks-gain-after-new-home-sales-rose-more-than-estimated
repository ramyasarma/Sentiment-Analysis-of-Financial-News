             U.S. stocks gained, erasing the Dow
Jones Industrial Average’s loss for 2010, after a report showed
sales of new U.S. homes rose more than estimated in June.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,107.31 as of 10:02 a.m. in New York. The benchmark measure of
U.S. stocks rallied 3.5 percent last week, reaching a one-month
high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49.50 points, or 0.5
percent, to 10,474.12 today.  
 Sales of U.S. new homes rose in June more than forecast
following an unprecedented collapse the prior month, a signal
the worst of the slump triggered by the end of a government tax
credit is over.  
 Purchases increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace
of 330,000, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. The rate was the second-lowest in data going back to
1963 after May’s downwardly revised 267,000 pace.
