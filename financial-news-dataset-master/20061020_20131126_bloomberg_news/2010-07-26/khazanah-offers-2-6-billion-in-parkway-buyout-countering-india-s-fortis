             Khazanah Nasional Bhd. , Malaysia’s
sovereign wealth fund, offered S$3.5 billion ($2.6 billion) for
the rest of Singapore’s  Parkway Holdings Ltd. , beating  Fortis
Healthcare Ltd.  for Asia’s biggest hospital operator.  
 Khazanah offered S$3.95 a share in cash for the 76.1
percent it doesn’t already own of Parkway, the Kuala Lumpur-
based fund said in a statement today. That’s 3.9 percent more
than the S$3.80-a-share bid by New Delhi-based Fortis on July 1.  
 The deal, poised to be the third-largest takeover of a
Singapore-traded company, gives Khazanah full ownership of 16
additional hospitals in eight Asian countries. Parkway would be
held under the fund’s Integrated Healthcare unit with stakes in
Pantai Holdings Bhd., India’s  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. 
and IMU Health Sdn Bhd. in Malaysia.  
 “Khazanah sees Parkway as strategic in terms of forwarding
Malaysia’s ambition of moving up the ladder in providing health-
care services to the region,” said  Lim Jit Soon , an analyst at
Nomura Securities in Singapore who has a “hold” rating on
Parkway. “It’s a good price for shareholders.”  
 The buyout would hinder the expansion plans of  Malvinder 
and  Shivinder Singh , who run Fortis. The billionaire brothers
are seeking to tap health-care markets in Asia, which are
expanding as much as 17 percent annually.  Fortis , which holds
about 24.9 percent of Parkway, said it will accept the proposal.  
 The bid values Parkway at S$4.5 billion and closes Aug. 16.  
 Fortis Gain  
 Fortis will book a profit of about S$117 million from
selling its Parkway stake, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The company will get the money in 30 days,  Sunil Godhwani , chief
executive officer of Religare Enterprises Ltd., which is
controlled by the Singh family and advised Fortis, told
reporters in New Delhi.  
 “Fortis feels that there are more attractive opportunities
to pursue its goal of building a pan-Asian health care delivery
network,” Fortis said in an e-mailed statement. Fortis also
said it will study the secondary listing of the company on the
Singapore exchange.  
 Fortis  gained 2.8 percent to 156.25 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close of trading in Mumbai.  Parkway , halted at the request of
Khazanah today, were unchanged at S$3.88 on July 23 at the 5 p.m.
close of trading on the Singapore exchange.  
 Parkway has more than 3,400 hospital beds in China, India
and Malaysia among other Asian countries, according to its
website. In Singapore, the group’s operations include the
 Gleneagles  and Mount Elizabeth hospitals, both located close to
the central Orchard Road shopping belt. It also manages a real
estate investment trust and provides health-care education.  
 Deal Multiples  
 Khazanah, which was advised by CIMB Bank Bhd. and Deutsche
Bank AG, offered S$3.78 a share, or S$1.18 billion, on May 27 to
more than double its stake in Parkway to 51.5 percent.  
 The new offer values Parkway at about 28 times 2010
estimated earnings, according to Bloomberg calculations, based
on an average  per-share estimate  of 13.9 Singapore cents.
 Raffles Medical Group Ltd. , Parkway’s biggest Singapore-based
rival, trades at 22 times earnings, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Parkway reported a 10 percent gain in first-quarter net
income to S$25.8 million, helped by an increase in foreign
patients at its hospitals in Singapore. Revenue advanced 8
percent to S$247.6 million in the period.  
 CEO  Tan See Leng  said in February that Parkway may make
acquisitions in China to tap rising demand for health care in
the world’s most populous nation.
