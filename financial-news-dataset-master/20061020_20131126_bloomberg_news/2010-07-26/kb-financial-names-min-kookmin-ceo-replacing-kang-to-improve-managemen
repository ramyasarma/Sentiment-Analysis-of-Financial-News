             KB Financial Group Inc.  promoted  Min Byong Duk  as chief executive officer of its Kookmin Bank unit,
South Korea’s largest lender, after Chairman  Euh Yoon Dae  said
he’d rejuvenate inefficient management to boost profit.  
 Min, 56, currently senior vice president of Kookmin Bank’s
commercial banking group, succeeds  Kang Chung Won , who resigned
on July 13, Min said today in a telephone interview in Seoul.
Yonhap News earlier reported his appointment.  
 Euh has compared KB Financial with an “obesity” patient.
The company has too many staff, high costs and inefficient
management, he said on July 13, when he began a three-year term
chairman.  
 “I’ll do my best with Chairman Euh to make Kookmin a
global bank,” Min said. “We’ve formed task forces to overhaul
inefficient systems and we’ll make changes as early as
possible.”  
 KB Financial  shares  fell 1 percent to close at 51,000 in
Seoul, compared with the benchmark Kospi index’s 0.6 percent
gain.  
 Euh aims to boost efficiency by reducing KB Financial’s
cost-to-income ratio, which rose to 54 percent last year from 42
percent in 2005, by cutting costs and enhancing risk management.  
 Min’s appointment as Kookmin Bank CEO needs approval from a
meeting of shareholders, KB said.
