             Trading of bullish Office Depot Inc.
options jumped to a three-month high as investors boosted bets
that the second-largest U.S. office-supply retailer will rally
after it reports results tomorrow.  
 Almost 10,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 11
times the four-week average and triple the number of puts to
sell, as the stock rose 5.2 percent to  $4.62 as of 11:38  a.m.
New York time.  Most of the volume  was concentrated in September
$5 calls, which climbed 50 percent. They changed hands 7,003
times, compared with an open interest of 79 co ntracts before
 today, which indicates that investors creating new positions
initiated almost all of the trades.  
 Analysts expect  a loss of 17 cents a share for the second
quarter, the average of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey,
compared with a loss of 31 cents a year ago. The retailer has
posted nine consecutive quarters of sales declines, dating back
to the first quarter of 2008.
