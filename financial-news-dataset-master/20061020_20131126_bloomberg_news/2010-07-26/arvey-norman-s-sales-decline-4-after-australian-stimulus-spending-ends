             Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. ,
Australia’s biggest electrical and furniture retailer, posted
a 4 percent drop in domestic fourth-quarter  sales  after the
government withdrew its stimulus spending.  
 Revenue  from outlets open at least a year fell 3.4
percent in the three months ended June, the Sydney-based
company said in a statement today. Full-year sales, including
New Zealand and Europe, rose 0.8 percent to A$6.03 billion
($5.4 billion).  
 Australia handed out more than A$10 billion in cash to
households last year to drive demand and help the nation
skirt the worst of the global recession. Consumer spending
has also been curbed in 2010 by increased borrowing costs,
with the nation’s central bank raising interest rates six
times from October to May.  
 “Computer sales weakened as the company cycled the
small business tax break on top of the cash stimulus,”
Harvey Norman said in the statement. “Furniture and bedding
continue to take market share despite the industry
experiencing a slow-down with the dampened housing market.”  
 Harvey Norman  shares  fell 3 percent to A$3.54 at the
4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney, their biggest decline
since June 7 on a closing basis. The stock has shed 16
percent this year compared with 7.9 percent decline in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.
