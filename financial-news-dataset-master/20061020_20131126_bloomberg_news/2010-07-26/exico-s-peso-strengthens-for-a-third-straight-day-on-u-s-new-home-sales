             Mexico’s peso gained for a third day
after a report showing sales of new homes in the U.S. rose more
than forecast eased concern the global recovery is slowing.  
 The peso strengthened 0.5 percent to 12.6714 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. New York time from 12.7317 on July 23. The
currency has risen 3 percent in 2010, the third-best performer
among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s
yen and Singapore’s dollar.  
 Purchases of new homes in the U.S., Mexico’s biggest trade
partner, increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace of
330,000. Economists forecast sales would rise 3.3 percent to an
annual pace of 310,000, according to the median of 73
projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “The peso is reacting to external events, especially data
from the U.S. housing market, and a positive reaction to stock
markets,” said  Bertrand Delgado , a senior economist at Roubini
Global Economics LLC in New York.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent today.  
 Traders triggered $571 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. The bank has been auctioning
$600 million in options monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars
to help boost foreign reserves after the peso reached a record
low last year.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bonds due in 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.87
percent, according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the
security fell 0.24 centavo to 128.49 centavos per peso.
