             Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB was
raised to “buy” from “hold” by Banco Santander SA analyst
Boris Molina, who cited the company’s stronger-than-expected
second-quarter results and the “upside risks” in its equity
business unit amid technological improvements.  
 The shares may rise to 25.50 pesos by the end of 2011,
compared with a end-2010 forecast of 23 pesos, the analyst said.
