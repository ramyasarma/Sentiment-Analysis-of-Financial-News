             India’s central bank said monetary
policy steps are a “necessity” to control inflation, signaling
the possibility of an interest-rate increase tomorrow.  
 “For containing the inflation persistence and anchoring
inflation expectations, anti-inflationary monetary policy
actions become a necessity,” the Reserve Bank of India said in
a report on the economy, a day before central bank Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao unveils the monetary policy.  
 India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation rate has stayed
above 10 percent since February and may accelerate after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government on June 25 allowed state-
run refiners, including Indian Oil Corp., to raise fuel prices.
The “major policy concern” is to cool inflation, today’s
report said.  
 The Reserve Bank will probably increase its reverse-
repurchase rate by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent,
all 20 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. It will
raise the repurchase rate to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent at
the 11:30 a.m. announcement in Mumbai tomorrow, according to all
but one analyst, who expects it to be kept unchanged.
