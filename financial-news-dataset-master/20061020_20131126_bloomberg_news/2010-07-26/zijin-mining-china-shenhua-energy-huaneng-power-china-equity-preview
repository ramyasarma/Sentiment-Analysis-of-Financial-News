             China’s stocks  dropped for the first
time in seven days on concern about rising credit risks at banks
and speculation recent gains for commodity producers were
excessive given prospects for slowing economic growth.  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest listed lender, retreated 1.2 percent on concern banks
may curb lending to local governments.  China Shenhua Energy Co. 
and China Coal Energy Co., the nation’s top two coal producers,
slid after prices for the fuel lost the most in four months.
Jiangxi Copper Co. dropped the most in two weeks, pacing
declines for stocks that are dependent on economic growth.  
 “The domestic economy isn’t reassuring as the slowdown has
just begun and it remains unknown if the government will relax
tightening as expected,” said  Wu Kan , Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 13.31, or 0.5 percent, to 2,575.37
at the 3 p.m. close. The  CSI 300 Index  slid 0.6 percent to
2,795.72.  
 The Shanghai index had advanced 6.8 percent over the past
six days, the longest streak since November, on expectations the
government will relax property curbs and allow more bank lending
to counter a slowdown in economic growth. The gauge has fallen
21 percent this year on speculation measures to control real-
estate speculation and rising consumer prices will damp earnings.  
 There are concerns Chinese banks may struggle to recoup
about 23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion)
they’ve lent to finance local infrastructure projects, according
to a person with knowledge of data collected by the China
Banking Regulatory Commission. China this year restricted
borrowing on concern money isn’t being used for viable projects.  
 Loan Defaults  
 Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. expects defaults on these
bank loans, chairman Guan Jianzhong said yesterday. There won’t
be a systemic risk to the banking system as regulation has
improved, he said.  
 Credit ratings assigned to yuan-denominated bonds issued on
behalf of local governments in China are misleading and don’t
reflect risks investors face, he said.  
 ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, fell 1.2 percent
to 4.28 yuan.  Bank of China Ltd.  dropped 0.3 percent to 3.55
yuan. China Merchants Bank Co. lost 1.1 percent to 14.11 yuan.  
 Coal Slump  
 Qinhuangdao coal prices, a Chinese benchmark, fell the most
in four months. The price of coal dropped 1.3 percent to between
740 yuan and 750 yuan a metric ton as of yesterday compared with
a week earlier, according to data from the China Coal Transport
and Distribution Association. That’s the biggest decline since a
1.5 percent drop in the week to March 15.  
 Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal producer, dropped 1.2
percent to 22.87 yuan. China Coal, the second largest, slid 0.9
percent to 9.30 yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. , the third
largest, retreated 3.1 percent to 16.16 yuan.  
 Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, lost
2 percent to 28.52 yuan. The stock advanced 16 percent over the
past six days.  Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. , the largest producer
of refined zinc, fell 2.2 percent to 9.69 yuan. Huludao Zinc
Industry Co., the second largest, lost 1.6 percent to 6.66 yuan.  
 China’s  stock market , the worst performer in Asia this year,
is “near the bottom” and may rally as much as 14 percent as
policy tightening concerns ease amid slowing economic growth,
according to Citigroup Inc.  
 Turbulent Market  
 The Shanghai A-Share Stock Price Index, which rose 0.7
percent to 2,713.20 yesterday, will probably reach 2,800 to
3,100 before the end of the year, outperforming gains in Hong
Kong-traded Chinese stocks, analyst  Minggao Shen  wrote in a
report. Still, the market may be “mixed” in the near term
before being spurred by a “liquidity rally,” he said.  
 “Policy headwinds that had caused turbulence in the market
are finally settling, along with downward trending economic
growth,” wrote Shen.  
 China will maintain stability in its economic policies in
the second half of the year, Premier Wen Jiabao said in a speech
in Beijing July 16. UBS AG economist  Tao Wang  said in a report
the speech signaled a “subtle shift” in government policies
and that no additional tightening measures will be introduced.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
 Anhui Golden Seed Winery Co.  (600199 CH) climbed 6.1
percent to 14.17 yuan after saying first-half net income jumped
177 percent from a year earlier.  
 Beijing Hualian Hypermarket Co.  (600361 CH) soared by the
10 percent daily cap to 9.31 yuan. The company said it plans to
raise 1.3 billion yuan from a private sale of shares to fund the
opening of 39 new stores.  
 GD Power Development Co.  (600795 CH), the largest
electricity producer in northeastern China, lost 1.7 percent to
3.51 yuan after saying that first-half profit fell 7.5 percent
from a year earlier.  
 Jiangzhong Pharmaceutical Co.  (600750 CH) added 1.3 percent
to 33.09 yuan after the company said first-half profit rose 33
percent from a year ago.  
 S&P Pharmaceutical Industry Co.  (600869 CH) surged by the
10 percent daily limit to 16.38 yuan after the securities
regulator approved its plan to buy assets using its shares.  
 Tsingtao Brewery Co.  (600600 CH), China’s second-biggest
brewery by volume, gained 4.2 percent to 34.63 yuan after Asahi
Breweries Ltd. agreed to produce its beer in China. Beijing
Asahi, a unit of Japan’s second-largest brewer, will produce
Tsingtao Beer products for the Chinese beermaker.

                          July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., talks with Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin about his investment strategy for Chinese banks. 
     Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent to finance local government infrastructure projects, according to a person with knowledge of data collected by the nation’s regulator. About half of all loans need to be serviced by secondary sources including guarantors because the ventures can’t generate sufficient revenue, the person said, declining to be identified because the information is confidential.
