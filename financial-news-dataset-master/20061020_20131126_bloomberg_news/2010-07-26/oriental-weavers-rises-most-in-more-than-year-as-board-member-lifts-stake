             Oriental Weavers Co.  gained the most
in more than a year as a board member of the Egyptian carpet
manufacturer purchased 678,000 shares.  
 The shares surged 9.1 percent, the most since March 2009,
to 37.44 Egyptian pounds. About 686,300 shares traded today,
that compares with a six-month daily average of 71,300.  
 The board member bought the shares at prices ranging from
34.9 pounds to 37.5 pounds, Oriental’s Investor Relations
Manager Haitham Abdel Moneim said, declining to identify the
purchaser.  
 Business daily Al Mal yesterday reported 60 percent of
construction work at the company’s threads factory has been
completed and it plans to start production at the plant in the
fourth quarter. Oriental Weavers will distribute a dividend of
one free share for every five held on July 29, the company said
in an advertisement in Al Ahram newspaper on July 20. The shares
have since climbed 12 percent.
