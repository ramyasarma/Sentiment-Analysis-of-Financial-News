             Results of the stress test on
European banks released last week were “mildly positive,”
according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 “Barring government default outside of Greece, the
stresses on banks are not that significant,” analysts led by
 Andrew Garthwaite , London-based global equity strategist at
Credit Suisse, wrote in a report dated July 23. “Stresses in
Europe have eased a lot in the past three weeks.”  
 European regulators found that seven banks need to raise a
combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital. Germany’s
 Hypo Real Estate Holding AG ,  Agricultural Bank of Greece SA  and
five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate reserves to
maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23.  
 Before the results were published, analysts at  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  estimated that lenders would need to raise 38
billion euros and Barclays Capital said they would require as
much as 85 billion euros. Tests carried out in the U.S. last
year found that 10 lenders, including  Bank of America Corp.  and
Citigroup Inc., needed $74.6 billion.

                          July 26 (Bloomberg) -- David Forrester, a currency economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about the outlook for the euro. 
     The combination of growing confidence in Europe’s economy and mounting evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. is driving euro bears into hiding. After tracking the euro’s slide from about $1.45 at the beginning of 2010, the median forecast of currency strategists has stayed within two cents of $1.20 since the start of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Forrester, speaking from Singapore, also discusses the results of stress tests on European banks released last week. (Source: Bloomberg)
