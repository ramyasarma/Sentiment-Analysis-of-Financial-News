             Japanese  stocks  rose as the results
of stress tests among European banks eased concern the region’s
recovery will stall and as the yen weakened.  
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of
its revenue outside Japan, jumped 2.5 percent. Inpex Corp.
surged 4.9 percent after Deutsche Bank AG reiterated its buy
rating on Japan’s largest energy explorer. Panasonic Electric
Works Co. leapt 4.4 percent as the manufacturer of building
materials and light equipment boosted its profit forecast.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.8 percent to 9,503.66
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after gaining as much as 1.4
percent. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.6 percent to 845.88
with about three stocks advancing for each that fell. The shares
pared gains after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its Japanese stock
allocation to “neutral” from “overweight.”  
 “Anxieties over the results of the stress test had weighed
on the market,” said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment
at Tokyo-based STB Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$14 billion. “Shares are rising after banks holdings were
disclosed, including the amount of sovereign debt.”  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.1
percent today. In New York, the S&P 500 Index advanced 0.8
percent to 1,102.66 on July 23 after speculation that a bio-
technology firm, Genzyme Corp., may be bought spurred optimism
that acquisitions are accelerating and General Electric Co.
boosted its dividend.  
 Stress Test  
 The Topix has declined 6.8 percent in 2010, compared with a
1.1 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 0.8 percent gain by the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are
valued at 16.4 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.4
times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 European regulators found that seven banks need to raise a
combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital. Germany’s
Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of Greece SA and
five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate reserves to
maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23.  
 The banks that failed the stress tests are in “close
contact” with national authorities over how they will raise
capital, said the Committee of European Banking Supervisors,
which ran the assessments of 91 lenders.  
 Exporters Advance  
 Before the results were published, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimated that lenders would need to raise 38
billion euros and Barclays Capital said they would require as
much as 85 billion euros.  
 “European banks will have to raise less capital than some
people expected, so that’s positive for investors,” said
 Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co.
in Tokyo.  
 Companies that rely on overseas sales advanced as the yen
depreciated. Canon jumped 2.5 percent to 3,530 yen, the  biggest
contributor  to the Topix’s gain. Fanuc Ltd., a maker of
industrial robots which earns about 80 percent of its revenue
outside Japan, climbed 1.7 percent to 10,490 yen. Hitachi Ltd.,
an electronics and industrial group which derives 40 percent of
its revenue abroad, advanced 1.2 percent to 344 yen.  
 The yen depreciated to 87.67 to the dollar, compared with
86.93 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Against
the euro, Japan’s currency slid to 113.48 from 111.98. The
weaker yen boosts the value of sales generated overseas in local
terms for Japanese companies.  
 Inpex Jumps  
 Mining companies including  Inpex  gained the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups. Japan’s largest energy explorer
soared 4.9 percent to 430,000 yen after Deutsche Bank reaffirmed
its “buy” rating on the stock, saying a $6.6 billion equity-
financing plan is a long-term positive. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-biggest oil driller,
advanced 1.7 percent to 3,520 yen.  
 Panasonic Electric leapt 4.4 percent to 952 yen, the third-
biggest gain in the Nikkei. The manufacturer of building
materials and light equipment boosted its full-year net income
forecast 53 percent to 23 billion yen ($263 million), citing
recovery in its electronic materials and automation control
businesses.  
 “Companies will likely post higher profit for the first
quarter and that should support the stock market,” STB’s Misawa
said. “Shares look very cheap in terms of valuations.”  
 Softbank, Eisai Gain  
 Softbank Corp. , the exclusive provider of Apple Inc.’s
iPhone in Japan, climbed 0.9 percent to 2,538 yen. The company
probably had a record operating profit of about 190 billion yen
for April-June, an 80 percent increase from the same quarter a
year earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported. The mobile phone
service provider’s biggest quarterly profit had been 136 billion
yen for the October-December period of 2009, the report said.  
 Eisai Co.  surged 3.9 percent to 2,887 yen, the sharpest
increase since May 2009. The drugmaker and Pfizer Inc. won U.S.
regulatory approval to sell a higher-dose version of Aricept
that the companies say will help counter a possible sales drop.  
 Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage, lowered its
recommendation on Japanese stocks to “neutral” from
“overweight.” The yen’s appreciation will hinder exports and
earnings momentum for Japanese companies will likely slow,
according to report by Nomura analysts including Ian Scott.
