             Roys Poyiadjis , the ex-chief
executive officer of AremisSoft Corp., a maker of business-
management software, was sentenced to probation for a $254
million fraud that a judge said was “of almost unthinkable
magnitude.”  
 Poyiadjis, 45, was ordered to serve six months of home
confinement for his role in a decade-old crime on July 22 in a
proceeding that was not publicized by U.S. prosecutors. U.S.
District Judge  Laura Swain  in Manhattan handed down the sentence
-- which also requires 600 hours of community service and a $200
million restitution payment -- because of Poyiadjis’s
cooperation with the government.  
 “You committed a terrible crime, a crime of almost
unthinkable magnitude,” Swain told Poyiadjis at the sentencing,
according to a transcript of the proceeding. The
“sophisticated” AremisSoft fraud “shows that you’re capable
of causing great harm” and “making that very hard to detect.”  
 Poyiadjis and  Lycourgos Kyprianou , AremisSoft’s former
chairman, were indicted in 2001 by a U.S. grand jury and charged
with securities fraud, insider trading and money laundering. In
addition to fabricating $90 million in revenue, Poyiadjis was
accused of making fraudulent representations about his sale of
millions of shares in the company.
