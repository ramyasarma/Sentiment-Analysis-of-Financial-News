             Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
biggest state-owned refiner, fell in Mumbai trading after
reporting an unexpected first-quarter loss as the government
failed to compensate the company for selling fuels below cost.  
 The shares fell as much as 2.3 percent and traded at 366.45
rupees as of 9:03 a.m. local time.  
 The company had a loss of 33.9 billion rupees ($722
million) in the three months ended June 30, compared with a
profit of 36.8 billion rupees a year earlier, New Delhi-based
Indian Oil said July 24. The average estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 3.7 billion rupees.
