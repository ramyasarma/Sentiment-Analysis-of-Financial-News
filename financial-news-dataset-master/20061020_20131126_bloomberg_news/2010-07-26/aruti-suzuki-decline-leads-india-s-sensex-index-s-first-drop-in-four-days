             India’s stocks fell for the first
time in four days.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.  led the slide after
its quarterly profit missed analysts’ estimates.  
 Maruti, the nation’s biggest carmaker, declined the most
ever after its net income fell for the first time in five
quarters as increased raw material costs eroded gains from
higher vehicle sales.  State Bank of India Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest lender, dropped the most in more than two months.
India’s central bank is likely to raise  borrowing costs  tomorrow
to curb inflation.  
 “The days of easy money have ended,” said  Gopal Agrawal ,
head of equities at the local office of Mirae Asset Financial
Group in Mumbai, which has $2.5 billion invested in India.
“Everyone is mentally prepared for a rate hike; only the
quantum remains to be seen. We are not seeing the earnings
upgrades. Our approach is more stock-specific now.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
declined 110.93, or 0.6 percent, to 18,020.05. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.6 percent to
5,418.60. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.6 percent to 2,291.32.  
 Maruti plunged 12 percent to 1,191.45 rupees, its steepest
one-day loss since it began trading in July 2003. First-quarter
profit fell 20 percent from a year earlier to 4.65 billion
rupees ($99.1 million), the unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. said July
24. The average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for 6.7 billion rupees.  
 Rating Cut  
 Jamshed Dadabhoy  and Arvind Sharma, analysts at Citigroup
Inc., cut Maruti to “hold” from “buy,” citing “earnings
headwinds.”  Kapil Singh , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
lowered it to “reduce” from “buy.”  
 Hero Honda Motors Ltd. , India biggest motorcycle maker,
plunged 7.5 percent to 1,804.3 rupees, its biggest one-day loss
since May 19, 2009.  Tata Motors Ltd. , the largest truckmaker,
lost 2.1 percent to 821.2 rupees.  
 India’s central bank is likely to raise interest rates for
the fourth time since March at a policy meeting tomorrow. The
reverse repurchase rate will be increased by a quarter-
percentage point to 4.25 percent, all 20 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed. It will raise the repurchase rate
to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent, according to all but one of
the economist, who expects it to be kept unchanged.  
 State Bank tumbled 3.5 percent to 2,410.15 rupees, its
biggest decline since May 14.  Housing Development Finance Corp. ,
the largest mortgage lender, dropped 1.2 percent to 2,958.55
rupees.  DLF Ltd. , the No. 1 developer, sank 2.9 percent to 313.1
rupees.  
 “The mood is extremely cautious among traders and
investors,” said  Kishor Ostwal , managing director of CNI
Research (India) Ltd., a publicly traded equities research
provider in Mumbai. “Some of the results have been below
expectations and there is a good chance of an interest rate
increase at the policy meeting tomorrow.”  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  1.88 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 22, raising total investments in the stocks
this year to 412 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Brigade Enterprises Ltd. (BRGD IN), a real estate developer,
rose 1.8 percent to 137.85 rupees after reporting first-quarter
profit jumped nearly fourfold to 139.2 million rupees.  
 Indian Bank  (INBK IN), a state-owned lender, sank 12
percent to 221.75 rupees after reporting that gross non-
performing assets almost doubled to 9.88 billion rupees in the

 Indian Oil Corp.  (IOCL IN), the nation’s biggest state-
owned refiner, decreased 2.3 percent to 364.65 rupees. The

year earlier.  
 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd.  (JPA IN) sank 5.8 percent to

 3M India Ltd. (3M IN), a maker of electronics and office
products, advanced 3.6 percent to 2,969.8 rupees, its highest
since at least 1991, after saying quarterly net income almost
doubled to 318.5 million rupees from a year earlier.
