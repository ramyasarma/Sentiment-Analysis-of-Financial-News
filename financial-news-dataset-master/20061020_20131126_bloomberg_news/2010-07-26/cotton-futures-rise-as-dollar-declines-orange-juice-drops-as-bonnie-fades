             Cotton rose to the highest price in
almost three weeks as the dollar’s decline enhanced the appeal
of some commodities. Orange juice dropped.  
 The greenback fell for the third straight session against a
basket of six major currencies, enhancing the allure of cotton
exports from the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials was little
changed today after reaching a two-month high on July 23.  
 “As long as the dollar goes down, the CRB gets excited,
and you get more action from buyers,” said  Sid Love , the
president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services LLC in
Overland Park, Kansas. “There is money available to trade
commodities.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 0.56 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 75.9 cents a pound at 10:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached 75.99 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 6. Before today, the
fiber gained 22 percent in the past year.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 1.6 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $1.4405 a pound in New York.  
 On July 23, the price reached a two-week high of $1.4575 on
concern that Tropical Storm Bonnie would damage citrus groves in
Florida, the world’s second-biggest grower. Over the weekend,
Bonnie dissipated near the Gulf Coast.  
 Brazil is the top orange producer.
