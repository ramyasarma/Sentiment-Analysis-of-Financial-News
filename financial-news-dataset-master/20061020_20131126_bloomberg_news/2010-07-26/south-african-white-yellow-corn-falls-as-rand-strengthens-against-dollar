             Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, fell as the rand
strengthened against the dollar, cutting the cost of imports for
local millers.  
 The rand traded at 7.3915 against the dollar at 9:05 a.m.
in Johannesburg, compared with 7.4227 at the close of grain
trading at noon on July 23.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, slipped 17 rand, or 1.4
percent, to 1,163 rand ($157) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery dropped 20 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 1,150 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the
world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery declined 2 rand, or 0.1
percent, to 2,463 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are
Africa’s largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
