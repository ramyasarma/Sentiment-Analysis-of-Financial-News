             India’s benchmark bonds fell,
pushing the yield to the highest level in more than two months,
as economists forecast the central bank will raise borrowing
costs this week to contain inflation.  
 The Reserve Bank of India will lift its reverse repurchase
rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent tomorrow, according to
all 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The increase,
which would be the fourth this year, may help temper inflation
that climbed to a 19-month high in June.  
 “There is speculation India may need further monetary
tightening measures in the short term to counter the inflation
challenge,” said  Devendra Das , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “That is going to keep
yields under pressure to rise.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 climbed
one basis point to 7.69 percent as of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate was the
highest since May 3. The price fell 0.06, or six paise per 100
rupee face amount, to 100.71.  
 The wholesale-price index jumped 10.55 percent in June,
after rising as much as 11.23 percent in April.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps, derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, increased. The
fixed payment made to receive a floating rate rose to 5.92
percent from 5.89 percent on July 23.
