             Rod Blagojevich is guilty of crimes
that included plotting to sell President Barack Obama’s former
U.S. Senate seat, a prosecutor told a Chicago jury as closing
arguments started in the Illinois ex-governor’s trial.  
 “He tried to shake down President-elect Barack Obama,”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Niewoehner told jurors
today, referring to an alleged scheme to gain something of value
in exchange for naming presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett to
the seat.
