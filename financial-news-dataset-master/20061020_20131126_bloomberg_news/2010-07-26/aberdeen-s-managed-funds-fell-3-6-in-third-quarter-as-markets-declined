             Aberdeen Asset Management Plc ,
Scotland’s largest money manager, said funds under management
fell 3.6 percent in the fiscal third quarter on a drop in
financial markets and foreign-exchange losses.  
 Assets under management slipped to 164.7 billion pounds
($255 billion) at the end of June from 170.9 billion pounds on
March 31, the Aberdeen, Scotland-based fund manager said today
in a statement. The company had net inflows of 300 million
pounds in the quarter.  
 “The third quarter of our financial year has seen weaker
global markets due to concerns over government debt levels, the
consequences for economic growth following the implementation of
austerity packages and fears of asset bubbles in China,”
Aberdeen said in the statement.  
 Aberdeen joins rival U.K. asset manager BlueBay Asset
Management Plc in reporting a decline in managed funds in the
last quarter. The  MSCI World Index  dropped 13 percent in the
period as concern about Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis spread,
leading investors to shun riskier assets.
