             German authorities arrested a 53-
year-old Rwandan man on suspicion of genocide in connection with
the 1994 mass slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by Hutus.  
 Prosecutors accused the suspect, identified as Onesphore
R., of coordinating three massacres in April 1994 while he was
the mayor of a community in the north of Rwanda, resulting in
the deaths of at least 3,730 members of the Tutsi minority.  
 The Tutsis had sought shelter in church buildings from a
“marauding” band of soldiers, secret police, militia members
and civilians, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe said in an e-
mailed statement. R., an ethnic Hutu, was arrested in the
Frankfurt area early today, the prosecutor said.  
 More than a 10th of Rwanda’s population, or about 800,000
people, died in a 100-day slaughter of minority Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by ethnic-Hutu militias 16 years ago. The
massacre began after the assassination of Rwandan President
 Juvenal Habyarimana , whose plane was shot down as it prepared to
land in the capital, Kigali, on April 6 of that year.  
 The Rwandan suspect was arrested for the second time in
Germany. He was ordered released in May 2009 after five months
in custody because witness testimony against him consisted
mainly of hearsay, the prosecutor said. A judge reissued a
warrant this month after investigators “intensively” gathered
more information.
