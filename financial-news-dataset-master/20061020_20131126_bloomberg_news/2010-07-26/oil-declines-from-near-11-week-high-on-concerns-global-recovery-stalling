             Oil declined for a second day in New
York on speculation that the global recovery may stall and crimp
fuel consumption.  
 Crude oil slipped from near its highest level in 11 weeks
as European equity indexes declined. The U.S. economy probably
expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter as the trade
deficit swelled, economists said before reports this week.  
 “We are bumping up against resistance again around $78,”
said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd.
in London. “It’s going to take better macroeconomic news or
perhaps storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico to spring prices
from their narrow trading range.”  
 Oil for September delivery dropped as much as 90 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $78.08 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $78.24 as of 1:44 p.m.
London time. Brent crude for September settlement on ICE Futures
Europe exchange was at $76.74 a barrel.  
 On July 22, the New York contract settled at $79.30 a
barrel, the highest level since May 5. Futures have gained 14.3
percent in the past year.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index  fell 0.4 percent to 254.94 at
1:27 p.m., having previously increased as much as 0.5 percent.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the correlation
between crude oil and equity markets to weaken in the coming
weeks, commodity strategist  Sabine Schels  said today at a press
briefing in London.  
 The crude oil market will start to focus “much more on
fundamentals and much more on what OPEC is doing,” she said,
referring to the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries,
which accounts for roughly 40 percent of global supply.  
 Contango to Flatten  
 OPEC’s 11 members bound by quotas reduced supply by 0.5
percent in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the biggest reduction since February 2009.  
 The so-called contango structure in the New York futures
market is likely to flatten, Schels said. This means there would
be less of a discount on contracts nearest to delivery relative
to longer-term shipments.  
 “We expect continued flattening in the curve” in the next
two or three months, potentially attracting investment in oil,
Schels said. “We usually see flows tick up again as the curve
flattens,” she said.  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie dissipated near the U.S. Gulf Coast
at the weekend, sparing refineries and offshore production
operations. BP Plc vessels returned to work in the area to
permanently plug a damaged well, the source of the largest oil
spill in U.S. history.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-long position  in New York crude futures to a three-
week high, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 36,145 contracts in the
week ended July 20, up 4.3 percent from a week earlier.
