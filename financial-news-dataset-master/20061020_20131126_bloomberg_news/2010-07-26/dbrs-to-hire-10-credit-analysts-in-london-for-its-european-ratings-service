             DBRS Inc. plans to hire 10 analysts
in London as the fourth-largest ratings firm restarts operations
in Europe.  
 The company plans to complete the hirings before the
yearend, said Dan Curry, president in the U.S. and European
units of Toronto-based DBRS. The ratings firm closed its London
office in January 2008 as the worst credit crisis since the
1930’s made the European operations “unviable,” Curry said.  
 Eight of the analysts will focus on structured finance
transactions, he said, and the company plans to add bank and
sovereign debt analysts next year.  
 “Structured finance is the place where market participants
think there is the greatest need for additional rating
agencies,” said  Curry .
