             German two-year notes fell as only
seven of 91 European banks examined by regulators last week
failed tests designed to show they can withstand another
recession and sovereign-debt crisis.  
 Ten-year government bond yields were near the highest in a
month as the  Committee of European Banking Supervisors  said the
banks that failed had a combined capital shortfall of 3.5
billion euros ($4.5 billion). Spanish debt led gains by so-
called peripheral euro-region nations as the findings boosted
demand for assets perceived to be higher risk.  
 “As people become convinced the recovery is in place, we
will see higher rates from here,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of
European interest-rates strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “While there’s some difference of
opinion over the strength of the tests, European banks are
pretty solid and that’s going to help spreads narrow.”  
 Two-year German yields climbed eight basis points to 0.83
percent as of 4:07 p.m. in London. The 0.5 percent security
maturing June 2012 fell 0.14, or 1.4 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.39. Bund yields climbed four basis points to 2.76
percent, the highest since June 21.  
 The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond fell 12 basis points
to 4.27 percent, sending the  yield premium , or spread, investors
demand to hold the securities instead of bunds down 17 basis
points to 148 basis points, the lowest since May 25. The Italian
10-year spread over bunds narrowed nine basis points to 123
basis points, with the Portuguese, Greek and Irish spreads over
bunds also shrinking.  
 Spreads Narrow  
 Spain’s banking rescue fund, known as FROB, has 12 billion
euros available, of which 10.6 billion euros have been allocated
to support mergers between savings banks and the rescue of
CajaSur, the Bank of Spain said. The fund doesn’t need to raise
more money, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said.  
 German government bonds returned 6.3 percent this year,
compared with 6 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 5.3 percent for
U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  
 Belgian 10-year yields slipped one basis point to 3.37
percent after the nation auctioned 2.3 billion euros of 2016 and
2020 bonds today. Italy and the Netherlands are scheduled to
sell bonds tomorrow.  
 The bank study assumed losses of 23.1 percent for Greek
debt, 12.3 percent on Spanish bonds and a 20 percent slump in
European equities in both 2010 and 2011.  
 ‘Capital Requirements’  
 “The capital requirements that came out were less than
expected,”  Sean Maloney , a fixed-income strategist at Nomura
International Plc in London, said after the results were
published on Friday. “You’ll have your doubters but the overall
result is probably a positive for the market,” damping demand
for bunds, he said.  
 German bunds fell  last week , sending the yield 12 basis
points higher to 2.72 percent. Trading had ended on July 23
before the results of the tests were released.  
 Hypo Real Estate Holding AG , Agricultural Bank of Greece SA
and five Spanish savings banks have insufficient reserves to
maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said then. The banks that failed the stress tests are
in “close contact” with national authorities over how they
will raise capital, said the CEBS, which ran the assessments.  
 The  Stoxx 600 Banks Index  dropped 4.4 percent this year,
led by Greek lenders, amid speculation holdings of European
sovereign debt may leave institutions with inadequate capital to
withstand a recession and tumbling bond prices.
