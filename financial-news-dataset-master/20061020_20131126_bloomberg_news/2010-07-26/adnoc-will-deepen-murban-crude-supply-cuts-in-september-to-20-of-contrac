             Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the
state-run producer in the United Arab Emirates capital, deepened
the crude supply cut of its main export grade for shipments sold
under long-term contracts for loading in September.  
 The company will cut supply of its  Murban  crude by 20
percent from contracted amounts compared with a 10 percent
reduction in August, it said in an e-mailed statement today.
Adnoc, as the company is known, will limit shipments of its
Lower Zakum grade by the same amount.  
 Adnoc will raise the amount of Umm Shaif and Upper Zakum
crude supplied for September, increasing the allocation for
those grades to 10 percent less than contracted amounts,
compared with a 20 percent cut for August loading, it said.  
 The U.A.E., holder of about 7 percent of the world’s oil
reserves, is the fifth-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping 2.32 million barrels of
crude a day in June, according to a Bloomberg survey. The
federation, which exports most of its crude to Asia, has the
capacity to produce about 2.8 million barrels a day, Oil
Minister  Mohamed Al-Hamli  said March 2.  
 Adnoc in June slashed August shipments of all grades to
customers.
