             U.S. 10-year swap rates are poised
to end a three-month slump upon a daily close above 3.06
percent, according to a Royal Bank of Canada report citing
trading patterns.  
 The rate dropped 105 basis points, or 1.05 percentage
point, to 3.0015 percent from 4.0555 percent on April 5. It fell
the most in the second quarter since the deepening recession at
the end of 2008 pushed Treasuries to their best performance in
13 years. The swap, which converts fixed payments to floating
for 10 years, is rising to test the upper bound of the channel
describing the decline, according to  George Davis  of RBC Capital
Markets, the Canadian lender’s investment banking unit.  
 “Keep an eye on the descending channel top at 3.06,”
wrote Davis, chief technical analyst, in a note today to clients
from Toronto. “A daily close above 3.06 would generate a
bullish trend reversal that would project additional gains.”  
 The 10-year swap would probably rise to 3.17 percent and
then 3.23 percent once it breaks through its declining trend,
Davis predicted. Drops in the rate are probably limited to 2.89
percent and the bottom of the downward channel at 2.81 percent,
he wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Trend channels are lines that
define the upward and downward boundaries of a consistent move
higher or lower.
