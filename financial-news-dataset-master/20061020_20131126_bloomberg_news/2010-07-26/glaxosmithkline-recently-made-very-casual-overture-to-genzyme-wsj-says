             GlaxoSmithKline Plc recently made a
“very casual” overture to Genzyme Corp., asking the
biotechnology company to keep it in mind if Genzyme considered
selling itself, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.  
 The companies didn’t extend that dialogue, the newspaper
said. Glaxo declined to comment, the Journal said.   
 Genzyme, which hasn’t decided whether it wants to sell
itself, is considering an informal offer from Sanofi-Aventis SA,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the
matter.
