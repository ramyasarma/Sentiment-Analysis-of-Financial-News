             Germany’s Defense Ministry will
examine the classified documents released by the website
Wikileaks. The publication of the 92,000 files is an
“extraordinarily remarkable circumstance” that could impact
the NATO mission in Afghanistan, ministry spokesman Christian
Dienst told reporters today in Berlin.
