             Almacenes Exito SA was raised to
“buy” from “hold” by Banco Santander SA analyst Joaquin Ley,
who said domestic demand will help Colombia’s economy to grow at
a faster-than-estimated pace, benefiting the company.  
 Shares of the retailer may rise to 25,000 pesos next year,
compared with a forecast of 21,000 pesos this year, according to
the analyst.
