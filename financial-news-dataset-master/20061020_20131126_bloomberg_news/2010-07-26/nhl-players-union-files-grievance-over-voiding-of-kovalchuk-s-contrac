             The  National Hockey League Players
Association  filed a grievance over the league’s rejection of
 Ilya Kovalchuk ’s $102 million, 17-year contract with the New
Jersey Devils.  
 The league rejected the contract on July 21, saying it
circumvented salary cap rules. The matter will now be heard by
an arbitrator.  
 The union didn’t say in a statement why it disputed the
league’s action, and a call to the association’s office seeking
comment wasn’t immediately returned. Devils spokesman  Mike Levine  declined to comment, and NHL Deputy Commissioner  Bill Daly  said in a statement that the league “looks forward to the
opportunity to establish its position before the arbitrator.”  
 If the agreement had been accepted, Kovalchuk, 27, would
have received $95 million during the first 10 years of the deal
and $7 million over the final seven seasons. He would have been
44 when the contract -- the longest in NHL history -- expired in
2027.  
 Kovalchuk was acquired by the  Devils  on Feb. 4 in a five-
player trade with the Atlanta Thrashers. The three-time All-Star
scored 10 goals and had 17 assists in the final 27 games for the
Devils.
