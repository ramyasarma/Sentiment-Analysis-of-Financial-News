             Chinese consumption’s percentage of
the Asian nation’s gross domestic product will increase with
rises in worker wages through higher household purchasing power,
Stephen Roach, the non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley
Asia, wrote in a commentary in China Daily.  
 Consumption is poised to rise from a “rock-bottom” 36
percent of GDP in 2009 and is the “real silver lining” to the
end of low Chinese labor costs, Roach wrote.
