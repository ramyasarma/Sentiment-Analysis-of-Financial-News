             Raw-sugar futures rose, extending a
rally that sent prices to a four-month high last week, amid
concern that supplies will be disrupted from Brazil, the world’s
largest grower and exporter.  
 There may be delays in loading sugar in the Port of Santos,
Brazil’s biggest, until October as low inventories among food
companies stoke demand, crop forecaster Datagro Ltd. said last
week. Futures traded in New York have dropped 31 percent this
year on estimates that rising production will end two years of
supply deficits.  
 “It seems we will have further disruption to the shipping
problems in Brazil,”  Thomas Kujawa , a co-head of the soft-
commodities department at Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, said
today in a report. “It seems bad weather in Santos will prompt
further spikes, as the only place the world can get its sugar
seems to be Center South Brazil.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.36 cent, or 2
percent, to 18.62 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
On July 23, the price touched 18.66 cents, the highest level
since March 22. The price gained 6.7 percent last week.  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, white-sugar futures for
October delivery climbed $6.90, or 1.2 percent, to $566.10 a
metric ton.  
 Brazil’s six main sugar ports had a record 111 vessels
waiting to load 3.56 million tons as of July 20, according to
 Santos Associados Consultoria Ltda . and Unimar Agenciamentos
Maritimos Ltda shipping agency.  
 In the week ended July 20, hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators increased their net-long positions, or bets
that prices will rise. Long positions outnumbered short
positions by 104,921 contracts, up 7.4 percent from the previous
week and the first gain since the week ended June 15, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
