             Sales of U.S. new homes rose in June
more than forecast following an unprecedented collapse the prior
month, a signal the worst of the slump triggered by the end of a
government tax credit is over.  
 Purchases  increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace
of 330,000, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. The rate was the second-lowest in data going back to
1963 after May’s downwardly revised 267,000 pace.  
 The lowest mortgage rates on record may help underpin
demand, stabilizing the industry that triggered the worst
recession since the 1930s. Even so, increasing  foreclosures  are
swelling the number of unsold existing homes, putting pressure
on prices and keeping buyers on the sidelines as unemployment
hovers near 10 percent and the economy cools.  
 Sales are “bouncing along the bottom,” said  Eric Green ,
chief market economist at TD Securities Inc. in New York, who
forecast an increase to 335,000. “The future is going to be
dependent on job growth. There’s no demand because confidence is
weak and employment is weak.”  
 Stocks rose as the housing report and an improved forecast
by FedEx Corp. lifted shares of homebuilders and transportation
companies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to
1,115.01 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. The S&P Supercomposite
Homebuilder Index climbed 2.9 percent.  
 Exceeds Forecast  
 Economists forecast sales would rise 3.3 percent to an
annual pace of 310,000, according to the  median  of 73
projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from
260,000 to 360,000.  
 The government had initially estimated May sales at a
300,000 rate and revised down figures for every month since
March. The 37 percent plunge in May was the biggest on record.  
 The median price decreased 0.6 percent from June 2009 to
$213,400.  
 Purchases increased in three of four regions, led by a 46
percent jump in the Northeast and a 33 percent surge in the
South, the largest area. Demand dropped 6.6 percent in the West
to a record low 57,000 pace.  
 The  supply  of homes at the current sales rate fell to 7.6
months’ worth from 9.6 months in May. There were 210,000 new
houses on the market at the end of June, the fewest since 1968.  
 To become eligible for a federal incentive worth up to
$8,000, buyers had to sign contracts by April 30 and close deals
by the end of last month. The surge in demand prior to the April
deadline prompted the government this month to extend the
closing deadline until Sept. 30 to ensure buyers had enough time
to complete transactions.  
 Existing Homes  
 Purchases of previously owned homes, which are tabulated
when a contract closes, fell a less-than-forecast 5.1 percent in
June, sustained by a backlog of deals waiting to settle, figures
from the National Association of Realtors showed last week.  
 New home sales are calculated when a contract is signed.
The drop in sales in May came after demand reached an almost
two-year high the prior month, according to last month’s
Commerce Department data.  
 With the deadline for signing a contract now past, it will
be up to advances in the labor market to support home sales.
Private U.S. companies added 83,000 jobs in June, fewer than
economists had forecast, and initial jobless claims have
averaged 449,700 this month, a sign firings remain elevated.  
 Mounting Foreclosures  
 Another challenge to new home sales is the rising tide of
foreclosures. Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week,
putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties
this year.  
 NVR Inc., based in Reston, Virginia, said last week the
original June 30 closing deadline to qualify for the tax
incentive resulted in a “surge in settlement activity” in the
second quarter, with closings jumping 63 percent from the same
time a year earlier. New orders fell 6 percent in the second
quarter to 2,559 units.  
 Homebuilders turned more pessimistic this month, with the
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo confidence
index dropping to 14, the lowest level since April 2009,
according to data released last week.
