             Top Glove Corp., the world’s biggest
rubber-glove maker, was cut to “underweight” from “neutral”
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. because the stock has surpassed its
share price estimate of 6.30 ringgit and is trading at a premium
to its peers.  
 It’s “looking toppish,” JPMorgan analyst Nicole Goh said
in a report dated July 26.
