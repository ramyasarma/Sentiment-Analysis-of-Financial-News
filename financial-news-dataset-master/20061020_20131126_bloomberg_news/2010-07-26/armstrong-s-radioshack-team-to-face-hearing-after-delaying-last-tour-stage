             Lance Armstrong ’s RadioShack cycling
team will face disciplinary hearings after delaying the final
stage of the Tour de France yesterday when riders wore
unapproved clothing featuring an anti-cancer theme.  
 The race was delayed 20 minutes while the team changed,
which could have disrupted television coverage, the
International Cycling Union said. Armstrong, who said this
year’s Tour was his last, is behind LiveStrong, a cancer support
group.  
 “The UCI regrets that an initiative for a cause as worthy
as the fight against cancer was not coordinated beforehand with
the commissaires and organizers of the event,” the group said
today in an e-mailed statement. “This could have been done
whilst remaining within the rules.”  
 Any fines will be donated to a Swiss cancer group, the UCI
said. RadioShack director  Johan Bruyneel  said “to be a race
commissaire, you don’t need brains but only know the rules” on
his Twitter page.  
 The UCI said Bruyneel’s comments were “utterly
unacceptable,” and he’ll have to appear before its disciplinary
board.
