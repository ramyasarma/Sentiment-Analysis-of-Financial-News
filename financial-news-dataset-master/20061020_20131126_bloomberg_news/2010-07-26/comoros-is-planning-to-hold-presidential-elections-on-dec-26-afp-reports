             Comoros will hold presidential
elections on Dec. 26, Agence France-Presse reported, citing
Ntole Kazadi, a representative of the Organisation
Internationale de la Francophonie.  
 The Union of Comoros, which comprises the islands of Grande
Comore, Anjouan and Moheli, agreed to hold presidential
primaries in Moheli on Nov. 7, the agency reported. President
 Ahmed Abdallah Sambi , who is from Anjouan, was due to hand over
power in May to a leader from Moheli under a rotating presidency
system. Riots erupted earlier this year on Moheli island after
Sambi’s term, which was to expire in May, was extended by 18
months, the AFP said.
