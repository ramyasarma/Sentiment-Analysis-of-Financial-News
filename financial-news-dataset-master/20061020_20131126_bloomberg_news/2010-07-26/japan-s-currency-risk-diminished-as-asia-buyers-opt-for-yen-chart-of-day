             More of Japan’s exports are
denominated in yen than any time in at least a decade, thanks to
rising sales to Asia, reducing the risk that the currency’s
appreciation will erode exporters’ profits.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows that 41 percent of Japan’s
exports were sold in yen in the first half of 2010, the biggest
proportion in data going back to 2000, a Finance Ministry report
showed yesterday in Tokyo. By contrast, 48.6 percent of Japanese
shipments abroad were made in dollars, a two-year low.  
 Over half of Japanese exports now go to Asian countries,
which pay for them in yen 48.1 percent of the time, more than
the proportions for the U.S. and Europe. By keeping the deals in
their own currency, exporters avoid the value of their
repatriated earnings being curtailed by a yen that has gained
about 8 percent against the dollar in the past three months.  
 “The increase in the yen ratio is good news for Japan as
it reduces the vulnerability to currency fluctuations,” said
 Azusa Kato , an economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. “There’s a
tendency that the more exports to Asia increase, the more the
yen ratio increases, and that will reduce currency risks.”  
 Kato said another reason why the percentage of exports
traded in yen is increasing is that more Japanese companies are
making the transactions using their offshore subsidiaries.  
 Komatsu Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest construction-
equipment maker, estimates it loses about 2.8 billion yen ($32
million) of annual operating profit for every 1 yen gain against
the dollar. China surpassed Japan as Komatsu’s largest market
last fiscal year, accounting for 19 percent of sales.
