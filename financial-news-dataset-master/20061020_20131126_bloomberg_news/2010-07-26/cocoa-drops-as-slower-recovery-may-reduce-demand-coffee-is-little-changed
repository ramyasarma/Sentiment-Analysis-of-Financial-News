             Cocoa prices fell in London on
speculation that a slower recovery in the global economy may
erode demand. Coffee futures were little changed.  
 Global growth may average 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent in
the next three to five years, below the 4.7 percent pace of the
five years leading up to the 2008 slump, said Stephen Roach, the
non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.  
 “Prices are looking at outside markets for direction,”
 Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO Futures in
Chicago.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 12 pounds, or 0.5
