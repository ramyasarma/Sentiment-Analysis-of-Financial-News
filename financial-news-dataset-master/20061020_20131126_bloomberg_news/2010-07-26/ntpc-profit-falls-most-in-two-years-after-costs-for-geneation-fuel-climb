             Profit at NTPC Ltd., Asia’s second-
largest power producer by market value, unexpectedly declined
16.1 percent last quarter, the most in two years, after fuel
costs rose as the government doubled natural gas prices.  
 Net income  in the three months ended June 30 was 18.4
billion rupees ($392 million), the New Delhi-based company said
in a statement to the National Stock Exchange today. That
compares with 21.94 billion rupees a year earlier and the  22.5
billion rupees  mean estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Lower profits may hurt the generator’s plans to accelerate
construction of power plants after failing to meet its target
for adding capacity last year because of equipment delays. India
in May allowed explorers including  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  to
double gas prices for the first time in five years increasing
costs for power producers and fertilizer-makers  
 “Higher than expected fuel costs have pushed down
profit,” said  Rupesh Sankhe , a Mumbai-based analyst with Angel
Broking Ltd. “We expect the company to add significant capacity
in the next two years that will help profits going forward.”  
 The company’s  shares  have dropped 13 percent this year
compared with a 3 percent gain in the benchmark  Sensitive Index 
of the Bombay Stock Exchange. The stock fell 0.1 percent to
201.75 rupees in Mumbai today. The earnings were announced after
trading hours.  
 Fuel Costs  
 The New Delhi-based utility’s fuel cost increased 12.3
percent to 87 billion rupees in the quarter from 77.5 billion
rupees a year ago, according to the statement today. That pushed
up expenditure 12.7 percent to 106.4 billion rupees in the three
months. Sales rose 7.8 percent to 129.4 billion rupees.  
 NTPC has 3,955 megawatts of gas-based capacity, according
to the company’s  website . The utility operates  28,840 megawatts 
of electricity-generation capacity on its own and has stake in
ventures that operate five other plants generating 2,864
megawatts, according to the website.  
 India allowed oil explorers to raise the price of gas to
6,818 rupees per thousand cubic meters from 3,200 rupees,
Information Minister  Ambika Soni  said May 19. About 90 percent
of the gas produced by ONGC and Oil India Ltd. is used by power
stations and fertilizer plants.  
 India needs state-owned NTPC to add capacity to end
blackouts in Asia’s third-biggest energy consumer. Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  estimates the economy will grow more
than 8.5 percent in the year ending March 31 and expand 9
percent next year.
