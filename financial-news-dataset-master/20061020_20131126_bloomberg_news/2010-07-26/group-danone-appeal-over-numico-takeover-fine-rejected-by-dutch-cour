             A Dutch court largely upheld a
regulatory fine against  Groupe Danone SA ’s Numico baby-food
unit, while lowering the amount the company has to pay for
violating disclosure rules during its 2007 takeover.  
 The Rotterdam district court lowered the fine by Dutch
regulator AFM by 10 percent to 86,400 euros ($111,700) from
96,000 euros because it took longer than a “reasonable term”
to rule on the appeal Numico filed, the court said in a ruling
on its  website  dated July 22.  
 Danone paid 12.3 billion euros for Schiphol, Netherlands-
based Royal Numico NV, which had a baby-food unit as well as a
division focusing on people whose diets are restricted by
illnesses. It was renamed as Danone Baby and Medical Nutrition.  
 The Dutch financial regulator fined Numico in September
2008 for taking too long to disclose takeover discussions.
Numico shares gained 11 percent on July 9, 2007, in Amsterdam
before AFM ordered trading halted. The companies didn’t announce
the takeover talks until after market close.
