             Hong Kong’s environment minister
promised to change the zoning rules to protect beaches after a
developer started work on private land on the coast in the
city’s country park area, the South China Morning Post reported.  
 Secretary for the Environment Edward Yau said a statutory
zoning plan will be drafted for the sensitive site, the report
said. The official made the comments after an inter-departmental
meeting yesterday, according to the Morning Post.
