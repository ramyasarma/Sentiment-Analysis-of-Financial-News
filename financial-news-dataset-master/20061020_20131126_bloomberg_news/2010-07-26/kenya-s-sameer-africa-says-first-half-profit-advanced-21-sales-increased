             Sameer Africa Ltd. reported first-
half net income rose 21 percent to 58.96 million shillings, the
company said in a statement published in the Nairobi-based Daily
Nation today.  
 Sales rose to 1.76 billion shillings from 1.55 billion, the
company said.  
 “Turnover for six months to June 2010 was 14 percent
higher compared to the same period last year driven by growth in
both domestic and export market revenue,” it said. “Similar
trends in performance are forecast for the remainder of the year
supported by marketing and sales promotional activities.”
