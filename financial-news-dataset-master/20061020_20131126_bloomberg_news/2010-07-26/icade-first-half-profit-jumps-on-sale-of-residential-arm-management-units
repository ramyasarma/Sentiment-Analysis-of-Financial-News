             Icade SA,  the property developer
controlled  indirectly  by the French state, said first-half
profit jumped more than eightfold following the sale of its
residential arm.  
 Net income  rose to 906.2 million euros ($1.18 billion), or
17.89 euros a share, from 111.5 million euros, or 2.29 euros, a
year earlier, the Paris-based company said in a statement after
the market closed. Net asset value fell 5 percent from Dec. 31
to 80.3 euros a share.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Serge Grzybowski  sold most of
Icade’s residential properties for about 2 billion euros in the
first half to a group of public and social housing agencies to
focus the company on more profitable commercial real estate. He
also sold buildings with limited scope for growing rents or
profits, and disposed of peripheral property management
businesses.  
 Asset sales  added a net 902 million euros to profit. Icade
doesn’t include valuation changes to its properties in its
income accounts and books a profit or loss only when it sells a
building. The company reiterated that it will pay a special
dividend of at least 4 euros a share in the second half using
proceeds from the sale of the residential business.  
 In February, Icade acquired Morgan Stanley’s controlling
shareholding in Compagnie La Lucette, a publicly traded real
estate investment company, for shares equivalent to a 4.5
percent stake in Icade. The purchase added 1.5 billion euros of
real estate to Icade’s assets.  
 Revenue fell 8.9 percent to 650.7 million euros in the
first half as a result of the sale of the businesses. Cash flow
per share from continuing operations dropped to 1.62 euros from
2.04 euros.  
 Cash flow will recover in 2011 and 2012 as projects
developed by the company open and home sales pick up, Icade
said.  
 Icade gained 1.32 euros, or 1.8 percent, to 73.06 euros in
Paris, lifting the company’s market value to 3.77 billion euros.
About  56 percent  of the shares are owned by France’s state-owned
bank, Caisse des Depots et Consignations.
