             Banpu Pcl has temporarily withdrawn
its application to the Foreign Investment Review Board to take
over Centennial Coal Co. as it is unlikely to receive clearance
ahead of Australia’s Aug. 21 election, the Australian Financial
Review reported, citing a bidder’s statement and sources close to
the Thai company. The FIRB hasn’t indicated it has any
objections to Banpu’s takeover of Centennial, and the company
expects a statement of no objection, according to the report.
