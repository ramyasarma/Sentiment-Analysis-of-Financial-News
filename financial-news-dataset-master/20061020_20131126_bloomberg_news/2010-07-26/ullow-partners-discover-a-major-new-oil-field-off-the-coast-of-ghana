             Tullow Oil Plc , the U.K. explorer
with the most licenses in Africa, discovered a “major new oil
field” off the coast of Ghana.  
 The Owo-1 exploration well “encountered a gross vertical
reservoir interval of 154 meters (505 feet)” in the Deepwater
Tano license, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Samples show it’s a light oil of 33 degrees to 36
degrees gravity on the American Petroleum Institute scale,
Tullow said.  
 “This is a big well and a big result for Tullow, we’ve got
here a very substantial light-oil discovery,”  Angus McCoss , the
exploration director at the company, said today in a phone
interview. “It’s really looking to be another transformational
oil field for Ghana.”  
 Tullow, which plans to start oil production from the
Jubilee field off Ghana this year, also discovered the Tweneboa
offshore field in the African nation. Tullow is the operator of
Deepwater Tano while its partners include Anadarko Petroleum
Corp., Kosmos Energy LLC and Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  
 Tullow rose as much as 5.9 percent to 1,249 pence, its
biggest intraday gain since July 2, and was 5.1 percent higher
at 1,239 pence at 9:03 p.m. London time. Anadarko climbed $1.76,
or 3.6 percent, to $50.53 as of 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  
 McCoss declined to give any guidance on Owo’s possible oil
resources pending further appraisal of the discovery.  
 Exploration Potential  
 Tullow had been targeting a 1.4 billion-barrel find of oil
equivalent in the Owo-Tweneboa-Ntomme area off Ghana, according
to a July 1 company  presentation .  
 “We are going to be partitioning the greater Tweneboa area
into a very substantial, highly pressured oil field at Owo and
the neighboring major oil and gas condensate field at
Tweneboa,” McCoss said.  
 Tullow and Anadarko, based near Houston, are exploring
African fields off Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  
 “We expect to resume the westward expansion of our
exploration activity in the Cretaceous Fan play, where we’ve
identified more than 30 prospects and leads with size and
geologic characteristics similar to the Jubilee field,”  Bob Daniels , Anadarko’s senior vice president for worldwide
exploration, said in a separate statement.
