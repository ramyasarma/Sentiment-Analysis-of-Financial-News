             Metropolitan train services in
Melbourne, Australia’s second most populous city, resumed after
an equipment failure at the biggest rail station caused
disruption for much of the day.  
 The fault at Southern Cross train station in the central
business district caused “major delays” with commuters facing
waits of more than an hour, Metro Trains Melbourne said on its
 website . Normal service resumed on all but one of the 16
metropolitan lines by 5:25 p.m. local time.  
 A train pulled down overhead wires near Southern Cross
station, causing a power cut at about 4:55 a.m., the Age
newspaper reported, citing Metro spokeswoman Geraldine Mitchell.
The metropolitan network has 211 train stations and carries
about 400,000 people each day, according to Metro’s website.  
 Commuters will travel free on July 30 as compensation, the
Age reported, citing the state’s Minister for Public Transport
 Martin Pakula .
