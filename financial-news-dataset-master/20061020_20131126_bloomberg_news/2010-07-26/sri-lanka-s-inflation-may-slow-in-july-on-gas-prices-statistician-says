             Sri Lanka’s inflation may slow in
July for a fifth straight month as cheaper liquefied petroleum
gas pushed utility costs lower, according to the chief of the
prices division in the statistics department.  
 “Point-to-point inflation could decline after gas prices
came down,” D.C.A. Gunawardena, director at the Department of
Census and Statistics, said by telephone from Colombo today.
“Sugar and lentil prices have also stabilized and there wasn’t
much variation in vegetable and fish prices.”  
 Consumer prices  in the capital, Colombo, climbed 4.8
percent in June from a year earlier after gaining 5.3 percent in
May. The rate has dropped to less than half the average of the
five years through 2009, helped by expanded cultivation on lands
recovered from the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. The statistics
office will release this month’s inflation figures on July 30.  
 The Central Bank of Sri Lanka on July 9 reduced the  reverse
repurchase  and repurchase rates by a quarter point to 9.5
percent and 7.25 percent, respectively, to support economic
growth after the end of the island’s civil war.  
 The monetary authority said July 9 that inflation will
remain “subdued” and at single-digit levels for the remainder
of the year. Sri Lankan gas retailers, including the local unit
of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, cut  prices  by as much as 7 percent on
July 1 because of cheaper input costs.
