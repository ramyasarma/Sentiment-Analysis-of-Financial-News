             Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to a one-month high, after most European
banks passed stress tests, boosting optimism over the health of
the global economy.  
 Standard Chartered Plc , a London-based bank, advanced 1.2
percent in Hong Kong. Canon Inc., which counts Europe as its
biggest market, climbed 2.5 percent in Tokyo trading. LG
Electronics Inc. jumped 4.2 percent in Seoul after the stock was
upgraded at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Inpex Corp. , Japan’s largest
energy explorer, surged 4.9 percent after Deutsche Bank AG
reiterated its “buy” call on the stock.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.5 percent to 118.01 as
of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its highest close since June 22.
The gauge has slumped 8.6 percent from this year’s high on April
15 as Europe’s debt crisis and China’s steps to curb property
prices fueled concern that global economic growth will slow.  
 “The stress test results weren’t the disaster that some
thought it would be,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage
about $1.1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “As
time goes on, the likelihood of a double dip recession seems to
be diminishing, but economic growth is going to be tempered.”  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 0.8 percent, while
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.6 percent. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index rose 0.9 percent.  
 Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.1 percent as rising
home prices boosted property developers. China’s  Shanghai
Composite Index  gained 0.7 percent as brokerages including Citic
Securities Co. predicted further gains for equities.  
 South Korean Growth  
 The Kospi index increased 0.6 percent in Seoul, where the
central bank reported a 1.5 percent expansion in the country’s
second-quarter gross domestic product from the previous quarter.
That was more than the 1.3 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News economist survey.  
 Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 lost 0.1 percent.
The gauge advanced 0.8 percent on July 23 on speculation
acquisitions are accelerating and General Electric Co. boosted
its dividend.  
 Standard Chartered, which earns most of its profit in Asia,
advanced 1.2 percent to HK$218. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s
biggest bank by market value, climbed 0.9 percent to HK$77.55.
Westpac Banking Corp. increased 1.9 percent to A$23.15 in Sydney.  
 Stress Test Results  
 European regulators found that seven banks need to raise a
combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital. Germany’s
Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of Greece SA and
five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate reserves to
maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23.  
 Before the results were published, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimated that lenders would need to raise 38
billion euros and Barclays Capital said they would require as
much as 85 billion euros.  
 The stress tests “might not be vigorous enough as the
tests are performed after recapitalization for the banks, but it
is a piece of slightly positive news for the investing public,”
said  Pu Yonghao , Hong Kong-based chief investment strategist for
the Asia Pacific region at UBS Wealth Management, which oversees
$190 billion. “The stress tests results remove market
uncertainties in Asia.”  
 Canon, the world’s largest maker of cameras, soared 2.5
percent to 3,530 yen.  Fanuc Ltd. , a maker of industrial robots
that earns about 80 percent of its revenue overseas, climbed 1.7
percent to 10,490 yen. Hitachi Ltd., which derives 40 percent of
its revenue abroad, advanced 1.2 percent to 344 yen.  
 Weaker Yen  
 Japanese exporters also advanced as the yen weakened to
113.22 per euro from 112.90 in New York last week. Japan’s
currency dropped to 87.47 per dollar from 87.46. The weaker yen
boosts the value of sales generated overseas in local terms for
Japanese companies.  
 LG Electronics , South Korea’s second-largest electronics
maker, advanced 4.2 percent to 103,500 won. The company was
raised to “overweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan analysts,
who cited the stock’s valuation and a potential recovery in the
company’s handset business from the fourth quarter.  
 Speculation that economic growth may disappoint dragged
down the MSCI Asia Pacific Index by 2 percent this year, cutting
the average price of stocks in the gauge to 14.2 times  estimated
earnings , near the lowest level since December 2008. That
compares with 13.4 times for the  S&P 500 Index  and 11.9 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 Export Growth  
 Economic data from the U.S. this month have fueled concerns
the world’s biggest economy is stalling. Sales at  U.S. retailers 
declined in June for a second month, the Commerce Department
reported on July 14. Home-builder confidence dropped this month
to the lowest level since April 2009, National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo data on July 19 showed.  
 Today, the Finance Ministry of Japan said in Tokyo the
country’s shipments abroad surged 27.7 percent in June from a
year earlier, faster than economists estimated. South Korea’s
central bank said separately that the country’s economy had
grown 7.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.  
 “As our economy has shown stronger-than-expected recovery,
it may have already entered a phase of expansion,”  Kim Myung Kee , an official at the Bank of Korea, told reporters today.
“Robust exports are now spilling into domestic demand.”  
 Gauges of technology and raw-materials companies posted the
 biggest advances  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today.  
 Materials, Energy  
 Inpex surged 4.9 percent to 430,000 yen.  Tomohiro Jikihara ,
a Deutsche Bank analyst, reaffirmed a “buy” rating on the
stock in a report dated yesterday, saying a $6.6 billion equity-
financing plan is positive for the company.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company,
increased 0.4 percent to A$39.82 in Sydney after copper futures
in New York advanced for a sixth day. Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s third-largest mining company, gained 0.6 percent to
A$70.25.  
 Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer, gained 0.8
percent to HK$16.98 in Hong Kong after it was reiterated at
“overweight” at Morgan Stanley, which said in a note to
clients copper was “primed” for a rally.  
 Also in Hong Kong, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the city’s
biggest developer by market value, gained 0.8 percent to
HK$114.80 after saying sold 300 flats at an apartment project in
the past two weekends, said  Victor Lui , an executive director at
Sun Hung Kai’s agency arm.  
 Hong Kong Real Estate  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s third-largest
developer, advanced 1.2 percent to HK$33.45. Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Ltd., the city’s second-biggest developer, climbed
1.2 percent to HK$94.10.  
 A gauge of property stocks in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
climbed 1 percent, the most of four industry groups. Hong Kong’s
home prices rose 0.35 percent for the week ended July 18 to the
highest level since 1997, Centaline Property Agency Ltd.
reported July 23.  
 In Sydney,  Wesfarmers Ltd. , Australia’s second-largest
retailer, jumped 3.2 percent to A$30.08 after saying sales at
its Coles unit rose 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  
 Among shares that declined, QBE Insurance Group Ltd.,
Australia’s biggest insurer by market value, slumped 5.6 percent
in Sydney to A$16.97 after its first-half insurance profit
margin missed the company’s target range.
