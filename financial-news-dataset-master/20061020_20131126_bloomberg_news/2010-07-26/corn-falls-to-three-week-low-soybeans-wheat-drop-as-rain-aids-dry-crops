             Corn fell to the lowest price in
more than three weeks, while soybeans and wheat declined, on
speculation that rain is reviving U.S. crops that were
threatened by dry weather earlier this month.  
 Weekend rain significantly increased soil moisture in
previously dry areas of the Midwest and South, said  Drew Lerner ,
the president of World Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas.
Forecasts call for showers and no sustained heat over the next
two weeks, which will be good for crops, Lerner said in a
report.  
 “Weather conditions are improving,” said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. “Farmers are going to be active sellers because they
are more confident in raising a big crop.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.785 a bushel at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $3.78, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since July 1. Before today, the commodity gained 12
percent since June 29, the day before the government said that
U.S. farmers planted less this year than they had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery slipped 14.5 cents,
or 1.5 percent to $9.67 in Chicago, heading for the first
decline in a week. The price fell 0.4 percent last week on
speculation rain would revive crops.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 10.75 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $5.855 a bushel on the CBOT. A close at that
price would be the largest decline since July 9. Before today,
the grain rose 39 percent since June 9 as drought damaged crops
in parts of Europe and Russia and too much rain in Canada
reduced the area planted this year.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
