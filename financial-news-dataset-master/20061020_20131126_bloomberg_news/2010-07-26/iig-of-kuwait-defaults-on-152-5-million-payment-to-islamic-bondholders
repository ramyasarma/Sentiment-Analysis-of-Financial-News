             International Investment Group KSCC 
said it is unable to pay $152.5 million to sukukholders who
demanded immediate repayment after the Kuwaiti finance company
defaulted on its $200 million Islamic bond.  
 International Investment continues to operate its business,
the company said in a  statement  to the Dubai Financial Market
today. IIG received approval of its financial statements from
the Central Bank of Kuwait, “thereby enabling KPMG to produce a
final report which will include an assessment of IIG’s present
financial position,” the company said in the statement. IIG can
then assess its restructuring options, it added.  
 In April, IIG became the second Kuwait-based firm in a year
to miss a sukuk payment.  Investment Dar Co. , owner of half of
Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., missed a payment on a $100 million
Islamic bond in May 2009, triggering concern about restructuring
laws for such securities.  
 Global Investment House KSCC , Kuwait’s biggest investment
bank, defaulted on loan payments in 2008. The bank in December
last year reached an agreement with its 53 creditors to
restructure $1.73 billion in debt.
