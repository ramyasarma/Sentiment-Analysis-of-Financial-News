             Copper climbed to a 10-week high as
shrinking inventories, a rally in equity markets and rising U.S.
home sales signaled improving demand for metal used in
electrical wiring and plumbing.  
 Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
slumped 7.7 percent in July, heading for the biggest monthly
drop since June 2009. The  MSCI World Index  of shares touched a
five-week high. Sales of new U.S. homes rose more than forecast
in June, the government said today. Copper has rallied for six
straight sessions, gaining 10 percent.  
 “Supplies are coming down and we’ve had a pretty good run
in the stock market, which are adding to expectations for higher
demand,” said  Donald Selkin , the chief market strategist at
National Securities Corp. in New York. “The prospects for the
global recovery are looking better.”  
 Copper for September delivery gained 3.8 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.223 a pound on the Comex in New York, after
touching $3.238, the highest level for a most-active contract
since May 13.  
 Purchases of new U.S. homes increased 24 percent from May
to an annual pace of 330,000, the Commerce Department said today
in Washington. Economists forecast a 3.3 percent gain to an
annual pace of 310,000, according to the median of 73
projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $120,
or 1.7 percent, to $7,149 a metric ton ($3.24 a pound).  
 Aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc also gained. Tin fell.
