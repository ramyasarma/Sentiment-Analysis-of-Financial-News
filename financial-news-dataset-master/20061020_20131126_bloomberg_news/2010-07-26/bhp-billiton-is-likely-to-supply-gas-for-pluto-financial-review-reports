             BHP Billiton Ltd. is among the most
likely contenders to supply gas for the expansion of Woodside
Petroleum’s Pluto liquefied natural gas project in Western
Australia, the Australian Financial Review said, citing Deutsche
Bank AG analyst Paul Young. BHP and Woodside could reach an
agreement in this half to allow gas for the project to come from
the Scarborough field jointly held by BHP and Exxon Mobil Corp.,
according to the report.
