             Apple Inc. , the world’s most
valuable technology company, was sued over claims its iPad
tablet overheats and fails to operate properly in warm
conditions.  
 The complaint, filed July 23 in federal court in Oakland,
California, seeks unspecified damages and class action, or
group, status. It claims the iPad “does not live up to the
reasonable consumer’s expectations created by Apple” because it
“overheats so quickly under common weather conditions.”  
 The iPad has a 9.7-inch touch-screen display that lets
users read books and magazines, view videos, play games and surf
the Internet. In direct sunlight, the tablet “turns off,
sometimes after just a few minutes of use,” according to the
complaint.  
 Apple  said July 20 that customers bought 3.27 million iPads
last quarter. Introduced April 3, the iPad outsold the almost
decade-old iPod music player, revenue-wise, Apple said: $2.17
billion in the quarter ended June 10 compared with $1.54 billion
for the iPod.  
 Apple representatives  Susan Lundgren  and  Steve Dowling 
didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  
 The case is Baltazar v. Apple Inc., 10-03231, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).
