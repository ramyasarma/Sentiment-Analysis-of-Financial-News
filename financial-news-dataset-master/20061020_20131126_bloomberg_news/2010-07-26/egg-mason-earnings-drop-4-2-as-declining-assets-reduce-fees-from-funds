             Legg Mason Inc . said fiscal first-
quarter earnings fell 4.2 percent as declining assets reduced
fees at the Baltimore-based money manager.  
 Net income decreased to $47.9 million, or 30 cents a share,
in the period ended June 30, from $50.1 million, or 35 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. Legg Mason
customers pulled $9.4 billion from bonds and $14.4 billion from
money funds, while stock funds gathered $700 million, the first
quarter of positive flows in more than four years.  
 Legg Mason, under Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting , is
buying back shares, improving fund performance and cutting jobs
after the firm suffered the biggest losses among publicly traded
money managers during the credit crisis of 2008. Investor
withdrawals and equity-market declines pushed the firm’s assets
down 6% from the prior quarter to $645.4 billion.  
 “Things are gradually turning, but they’re not yet at
break-even on the flows,”  Jeffrey Hopson , an analyst with
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone
interview before the results were announced.  
 Excluding some items, Hopson expected Legg Mason to earn 34
cents a share, compared with the 31-cent estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Legg Mason reported income excluding
certain costs of $96.3 million, or 60 cents a share, while
estimates ranged from 22 cents to 37 cents a share. Costs to
raise a $1.3 billion closed-end fund reduced earnings during the
quarter by 7 cents a share.  
 Cost Cutting  
 The company said on May 10 that reducing 350 jobs and
moving certain technology functions to its investment affiliates
will help save $130 million to $150 million by the end of fiscal
2012. The firm said the measures will add 6 percent to 8 percent
to its operating margin, which was 23 percent in the quarter.  
 Legg Mason had about $82 billion in net withdrawals in the
12 months through March after stock and bond funds, including
those managed by  Bill Miller  and the firm’s Western Asset
Management unit, lagged behind peers in 2008. Withdrawals slowed
to about $10.9 billion in the quarter ended March 31 from $32.7
billion in the previous three months, as performance rebounded
starting last year.  
 Legg Mason’s bond funds accounted for about 55 percent of
the firm’s assets under management as of June 30, according to
the company. Equity funds made up about 24 percent, while money
funds represented the rest.  
 Peltz Investment  
 Cash invested in structured investment vehicles contributed
to a streak of five quarterly losses that ended in March 2009,
after the firm eliminated the mortgage-linked debt from its
money-market funds. Activist investor  Nelson Peltz  last year
raised his stake to become the  largest shareholder  in the
company, and he was named a director in October.  
 Returns improved in 2009, after being dragged down in 2008
by Miller’s investments in financial companies. Miller’s  Capital
Management Opportunity Trust  fund soared 83 percent in 2009,
while his  Capital Management Value Trust  climbed 41 percent,
beating the 26 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
of large U.S. stocks, including dividends. The $1.8 billion
Opportunity Trust fell 0.4 percent this year through July 22,
while the $4.1 billion Value Trust declined 5.8 percent.  
 Legg Mason reported results after the close of regular U.S.
trading. The company is almost unchanged this year, similar to
the  S&P 500 .
