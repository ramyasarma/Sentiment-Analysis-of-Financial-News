             Peruvians bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in more than four months, as economic expansion
spurs foreign demand for the Andean country’s assets.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, to 5.32 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local unit
at 4:22 p.m. New York time. That’s the steepest decline since
March 5. The bond’s price rose 0.82 centimo to 119 centimos per
sol.  
 Domestic demand for goods and services rose 11 percent in
the first five months of the year while  gross domestic product 
grew 7.4 percent, the central bank said July 24.  
 “Foreign investors are positioning themselves in long-term
bonds expecting them to keep their value,” said  Alonso Segura ,
head of analysis at Banco de Credito in Lima. “They’re trying
to be in the longer part of the yield curve, which is closer to
its fundamental value” than yields on short-term bonds.  
 Rising demand led the government to sell 600 million soles
($212.5 million) of fixed-rate bonds in a July 22 auction, the
most it has sold under its monthly debt auction program.  
 The sol was little changed at 2.8236 per U.S. dollar, from
2.8235 on July 23.  
 The central bank didn’t  intervene  in the foreign-exchange
market today, it said on its website.  
 Peru’s net foreign currency reserves were $38 billion as of
July 20, compared with $35 billion as of June 30, and $33
billion at the end of 2009, the central bank said. This month’s
increase in reserves is partly the result of the bank purchasing
$1.4 billion in the foreign-exchange market, it said.
