             General Growth Properties Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, appointed  Steven J. Douglas 
as executive vice president and chief financial officer,
effective immediately.  
 Douglas succeeds Ed Hoyt, who has been the company’s
interim CFO since 2008, Chicago-based General Growth said in a
statement today. Douglas was previously president of Brookfield
Properties Corp., the owner of Canada’s tallest skyscraper and
New York’s World Financial Center.  
 “We are extremely pleased to welcome Steve to our
management team,” Chief Executive Officer  Adam Metz  said in the
statement. “His financial expertise and industry experience
make him well qualified to lead GGP’s finance operations as we
enter a new stage in the company’s history.”  
 General Growth began the largest real-estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The company
had amassed a $27 billion debt load while making acquisitions.
Its exit from bankruptcy is being financed by companies
including Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which is Brookfield
Properties’ principal shareholder.  
 Douglas will be paid an annual salary of $650,000, General
Growth said in a regulatory filing.
