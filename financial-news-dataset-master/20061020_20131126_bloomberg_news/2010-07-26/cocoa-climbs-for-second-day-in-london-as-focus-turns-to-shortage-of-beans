             Cocoa rose for a second day in
London as traders switched focus to a shortage of beans.  
 Supplies of cocoa beans will fall behind demand by 95,000
metric tons in the season that ends Sept. 30, Macquarie Group
Ltd. estimated in June. “Short” traders who correctly bet on
lower prices last week after the expiration of July futures may
be buying back contracts, supporting prices today, said  Doug Whitehead , an analyst at Rabobank International in London.  
 “Shorts made money on this decline, and now they’re
starting to cover short positions,” Whitehead said.  
 Cocoa for delivery in September rose 14 pounds, or 0.6
percent, to 2,311 pounds ($3,580) a ton at 11:45 a.m. on the
Liffe exchange. Prices rose 1.1 percent on July 23.  
 September cocoa on Liffe is 118 pounds more costly than the
December contract, down from as much as 197 pounds higher on
July 7, indicating that the shortage may be easing. The
September contract fell 6.1 percent last week, the biggest
decline since June 2009.  
 Hedge funds and other large speculators in New York cocoa
futures were net long, or betting on higher prices, by 29,005
contracts as of July 20, the most since May 11, according to the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Liffe exchange is
considering compiling a similar report for London cocoa in the
third quarter.  
 Robusta coffee futures for September delivery fell 0.5
percent to $1,721 a ton and white, or refined, sugar for October
delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $564 a ton.
