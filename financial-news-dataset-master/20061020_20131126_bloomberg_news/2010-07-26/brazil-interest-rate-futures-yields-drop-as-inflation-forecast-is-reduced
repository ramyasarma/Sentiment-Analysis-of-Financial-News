             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell as economists cut their year-end forecast
for inflation to the lowest in three months and pared their
estimate for the central bank’s benchmark borrowing costs.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 10.92 percent at 8:36 a.m. New York time. It declined
12 basis points last week as the central bank raised the key
lending rate to 10.75 percent from 10.25 percent, surprising 48
of 51 economists, who expected a 75-basis-point increase.  
 “A lot of people expected the survey to show an upward
shift in inflation expectations after the central bank’s
decision last week,” said  Tony Volpon , a Latin America
strategist at Nomura Securities in New York. “That didn’t
happen, and the curve shifted lower. The big context here is
that data looks weak until at least next week.”  
 The inflation rate will end the year at 5.35 percent,
compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.42 percent, according
to the median forecast in a July 23 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today. The central bank’s eight-member
board, led by  Henrique Meirelles , will raise the Selic to 11.75
percent by year-end, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 12
percent, the survey shows.  
 The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7680 per dollar,
from 1.7738 at the end of last week.
