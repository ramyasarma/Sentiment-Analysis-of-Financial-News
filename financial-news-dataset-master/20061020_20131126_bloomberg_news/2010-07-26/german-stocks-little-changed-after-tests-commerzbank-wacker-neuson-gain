             German stocks climbed with the
benchmark DAX Index advancing for a fourth day as Deutsche Post
AG rallied and U.S. new home sales beat forecasts.  
 Deutsche Post, operator of the DHL express-mail and freight
business, rose 1.5 percent, after rival FedEx Corp. boosted its
net income forecast. Commerzbank AG surged 3.5 percent as every
German bank except  Hypo Real Estate Holding AG  passed the
European Union’s stress test on July 23.  
 The  DAX  rose 0.5 percent to 6,194.21 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt. The measure has still fallen 2.1 percent from this
year’s high on April 26 amid concern that the economic recovery
is losing steam as indebted European governments slash spending
and China takes steps to cool its economy. The broader HDAX
Index also gained 0.5 percent.  
 “Fluctuations of confidence in the European Monetary Union
will continue to trigger changes in capital flows affecting
equity prices,” Tammo Greetfeld, senior equity strategist at
UniCredit Markets & Investment Banking in Munich, wrote in a
report today. “We reiterate our view that for the Euro Stoxx 50
the ‘best-case scenario’ for the second half of 2010 is a broad-
based sideways move.”  
 Stocks erased their earlier losses after a report showed
sales of U.S. new homes rose more than forecast in June.
Purchases increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace of
330,000, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. The number of sales was the second-lowest since the
series began in 1963. May’s 267,000 sales were the worst ever.  
 Commerzbank Passes Test  
 Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-largest bank, rose 3.5
percent to 6.67 euros after its Tier 1 ratio fell to 9.1 percent
under the stress test’s simulation of a recession and a
sovereign-debt crisis. Regulations require all banks to maintain
Tier 1 capital of at least 6 percent.  
 Deutsche Post increased 1.5 percent to 13.32 euros as rival
FedEx, the second-largest U.S. package-shipping company, raised
its earnings forecast for this quarter and the full year on
improving demand for express and ground deliveries.  
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG , Germany’s largest private
broadcaster, jumped 12 percent to 13.96 euros after reporting
that second-quarter net income gained 64 percent to 74.5 million
euros on improved revenue.  
 Praktiker AG climbed 6.4 percent to 5.95 euros, its highest
price this month. Germany’s second-biggest home-improvement
retailer was raised to “buy” from “reduce” at BHF-Bank AG.  
 Henkel AG & Co. , the chemicals producer, fell 1.3 percent
to 39.64 euros, leading other chemicals companies lower.  Bayer
AG  slipped 0.6 percent to 45.50 euros.  
 Beiersdorf AG, the maker of Elastoplast bandages and Nivea
skin cream, fell 0.9 percent to 47.06 euros, while Adidas AG
dropped 1 percent to 42.15 euros.
