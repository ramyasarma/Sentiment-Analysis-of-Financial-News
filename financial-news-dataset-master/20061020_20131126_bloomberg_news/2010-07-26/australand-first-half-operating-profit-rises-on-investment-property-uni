             Australand Property Group , the
Australian  unit  of Singapore’s  CapitaLand Ltd. , returned to
profit in the first half, driven by its investment properties.  
 Net income was A$72.2 million ($65.1 million) in the six
months ended June 30, from a A$268.8 million loss a year earlier,
the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange today. Operating profit was A$60.4 million, from
A$60 million a year ago.  
 “A quality investment portfolio with a good tenant base”
is one of Australand’s strengths,  Simon Wheatley , an analyst at
Goldman Sachs JBWere, wrote in a note earlier this month when he
initiated coverage of the stock with a “hold” rating.  
 Australand has benefitted from demand for residential
properties in Australia, driven by a growing population and a
housing shortage. Stable rents and relatively low vacancy rates
in its office portfolio also helped boost earnings, it said.  
 Operating profit for 2010 will be similar to the A$168.8 it
saw in 2009, Australand said.  
 Australand  shares  were up 0.8 percent at 10:10 a.m. in
Sydney trading.
