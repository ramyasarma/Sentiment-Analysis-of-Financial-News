             Australia’s Treasury projected a
slightly larger budget deficit this year and surplus in 2013 as
it issued pre-election forecasts that mainly reiterated data
released two weeks ago.  
 The incoming government will face a shortfall of A$40.7
billion ($36.4 billion) in 2010-11, up from A$40.4 billion
forecast in an economic statement issued by Treasurer  Wayne Swan 
on July 14, and a surplus of $3.5 billion in 2012-13, up from
A$$3.1 billion, Treasury said in a statement.  
 Today’s  document  is part of a so-called  charter  of honesty
that gives the opposition a chance to see how much money is
available for new spending ahead of the Aug. 21 ballot. The
Treasury reaffirmed its forecast that gross domestic product
would rise 3 percent in 2010-11.  
 Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s Labor Party and opposition
leader  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal-National coalition are vying over
who can better manage the nation’s finances. Both pledge to
return the budget to surplus and maintain an independent central
bank and its inflation target of 2 to 3 percent in an economy
that  expanded  for a fifth straight quarter in the three months
ended March 31.  
 Gillard says the Labor government’s stimulus measures
helped the nation skirt last year’s global recession. Abbott
says the A$42 billion the government handed out since the global
financial crisis helped push the central bank to increase
 interest rate  six times since last October.
