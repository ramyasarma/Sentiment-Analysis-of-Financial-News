             Muscovites sweltered as the
temperature soared to a record 37.4 degrees Celsius (99.3
Fahrenheit), and the number of Russians who drowned trying to
beat the heat reached about 2,000.  
 Today’s temperature in the capital was the hottest since
records began 130 years ago, the Hydrometeorological Monitoring
Service said on its  website . It surpassed the previous high of
36.8 degrees set in July 1920 during the Civil War. The mercury
may rise to 38 degrees on July 29, according to  Gidromettsentr ,
the state weather service.  
 Unusually high temperatures have contributed to record
 deaths by drowning  across Russia, which increased by 688 in the
past three weeks, Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported on July 23, citing
Emergency Situations Ministry data. Most of those who drowned
were intoxicated, the government’s newspaper of record said.
Another 39 people died yesterday, the ministry said on its
 website .  
 The heat wave has also hit Russia’s economy, with drought
damage to 10.1 million hectares, or 32 percent of all land under
cultivation, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said on July
23. The ministry has declared weather-related emergencies in 23
crop-producing regions.  
 Russian food grain prices may double in 2010 from last year
because of the drought, the Grain Producers’ Union said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 OAO GAZ, the van and truck maker controlled by billionaire
 Oleg Deripaska , halted production for two weeks because of the
heat. Workers were sent home today on a “corporate vacation”
through Aug. 8, spokeswoman  Natalya Anisimova  said by telephone.  
 Peat-Bog Fires  
 The country’s chief health official has urged companies to
adopt a siesta regime of breaks for workers during the hottest
part of the day to avoid injury and illness. Officials have also
urged farmers to start harvesting at night to protect their
combines from mechanical failure during the daytime heat.  
 Muscovites’ misery was compounded today by thick smoke from
burning peat bogs east of the city. Twenty-one separate peat-bog
fires were burning as of 10 a.m. today, according to the
Emergency Situations Ministry.  
 Two Il-76 transport planes, capable of carrying 42 metric
tons of water, and a Be-200 amphibious plane are fighting the
fires, the ministry said on its website.
