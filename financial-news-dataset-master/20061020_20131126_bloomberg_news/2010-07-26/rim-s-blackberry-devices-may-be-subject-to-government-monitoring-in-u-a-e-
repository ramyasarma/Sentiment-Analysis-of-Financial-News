             Research In Motion Ltd. ’s BlackBerry
smartphones may be subject to monitoring in the United Arab
Emirates if the government is able to bring communications by
the handheld devices under emergency and security rules.  
 Blackberry devices, introduced in the U.A.E. in 2006, are
not covered by the country’s 2007 Safety, Emergency and National
Security rules, the  Telecommunications Regulatory Authority  said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 “We have been working for a long time to resolve these
critical issues, with the objective of finding a solution that
safeguards our consumers and operates within the boundaries of
U.A.E. law,” the regulator said in the statement.  
 Data from Blackberry communications is managed outside of
the U.A.E., meaning it is “beyond the jurisdiction of national
legislation,” the regulator said. “Certain Blackberry
applications allow people to misuse the service, causing serious
social, judicial and national security repercussions.”  
 India’s government has sought to enable its security
services to monitor Blackberry communications, which are
encrypted and not readable, The Economic Times reported July 1.
