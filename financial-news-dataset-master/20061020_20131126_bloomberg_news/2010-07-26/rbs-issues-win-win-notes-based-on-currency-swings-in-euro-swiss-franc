             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
issued structured notes that pay a return based on swings in the
Swiss franc versus the euro, regardless of what direction
they’re in.  
 Investors in the so-called win-win notes get a coupon equal
to the franc’s rise or fall against the common currency after
five years, according to  Kemal Bagci , a Frankfurt-based director
in RBS’s equity derivatives unit. The notes pay a minimum return
of 10 percent, he said.  
 RBS plans to issue about 20 million euros ($26 million) of
the notes, which will be listed on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart
stock exchanges when the subscription period closes at the end
of August. The note includes a 1.5 percent fee which is
incorporated into the pricing structure.  
 “This suits the current market conditions as you’ve seen
a lot of currency speculators betting on the future of the euro,
while the Swiss currency has drawn investors in who view it as a
safe haven,” Bagci said. “We are mainly targeting private
banks for this product.”
