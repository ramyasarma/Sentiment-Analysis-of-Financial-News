             U.S. crude oil inventories probably
fell to a four-month low last week as imports declined and
Tropical Storm Bonnie disrupted production in the Gulf of
Mexico, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Stockpiles  fell 1.73 million barrels, or 0.5 percent, in
the seven days ended July 23 from 353.5 million the week
earlier, according to the median of 16 analyst  estimates  before
an Energy Department report tomorrow. The last time supplies
were so low was March 19, when prices averaged $81.46 a barrel.  
 Producers evacuated 15 rigs and 106 production platforms in
anticipation of Bonnie, idling 52 percent of U.S. Gulf oil
output, according to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
Regulation and Enforcement. The storm dissipated over the Gulf
on July 24 without making landfall in the oil-producing region.
About 15 percent of production remained shut-in today.  
 “We’ll see storm-related statistics because we’ll see
delays in the shipping and delays in production,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks and Opinions LLC in Houston.
“The big delays are going to come from imports and maybe even
carry over to next week.”  
 The Gulf accounts for about 31 percent of U.S. oil output,
according to the Energy Department.  
 Oil for September delivery fell $1.48, or 1.9 percent, to
settle at $77.50 a barrel today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices have dropped 2.3 percent this year.  
 Prices declined from the settlement after the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 3.08 million barrels to 356.3 million.
September oil fell $1.68, or 2.1 percent, to $77.30 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  
 Weekly Imports  
 While analysts forecast imports fell last week, they jumped
7.5 percent to an average 9.98 million barrels a day in the week
ended July 16, Energy Department figures showed on July 21.  
 “You usually get a little bit of a drop-off in crude oil
imports around this time of year,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St.
Louis. “The seasonal focus at this time of year is on the end
of summer and to get as much gasoline out of inventory as you
can.”  
 Refineries probably operated  at 91 percent of capacity last
week, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous week,
according to the median of analyst responses. Utilization rates
in the week ended July 16 were at the highest level since August
2007.  
 “We’ve got so much crude in storage at this point, and
demand hasn’t come in yet, so we’re unlikely to maintain
refinery demand at these levels,” said  Michael Fitzpatrick ,
vice president of energy at MF Global in New York.  
 Gasoline Supplies  
 Gasoline inventories  increased 275,000 barrels, from 222.2
million the prior week, according to the survey. Sixteen
respondents gave product-supply estimates. Ten analysts
anticipated an increase, and six forecast a decline.  
 U.S. gasoline demand in the four weeks ended July 16
climbed 0.5 percent to 9.36 million barrels a day, or about
16,000 less than the highest level since August 2008.  
 Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, climbed 2 million barrels from 166.6
million, according to the survey. All 16 respondents forecast a
gain.  
 Fifteen of the respondents forecast a decrease in oil
supplies and one estimated a gain. The Energy Department is
scheduled to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Washington.
