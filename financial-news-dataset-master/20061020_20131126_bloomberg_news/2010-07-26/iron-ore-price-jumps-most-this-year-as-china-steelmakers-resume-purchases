             The spot price of iron ore delivered
to China, the biggest buyer of the steelmaking ingredient,
jumped the most in almost seven months as buyers from the Asian
nation returned to the market.  
 The  cost  of 62 percent iron ore delivered to the port of
Tianjin rose 5 percent to $133.40 a metric ton, the biggest one-
day gain since Dec. 30, according to The Steel Index. The price
hasn’t posted a  decline  for nine consecutive days after posting
16 straight days of losses through July 13.  
 Chinese buyers had been absent from the spot market for
almost a month and were shunning purchases amid speculation of
lower prices, Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty analysts said in a report
dated July 9.  Vale SA , Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  are
the biggest exporters of iron ore, making up about two-thirds of
seaborne supply. China is the world’s biggest steel producer.  
 “The Chinese are back in the market buying,” London-based
ING Groep NV mining analyst  Nick Hatch  said today by phone.
“They probably overstocked and there was a bit of a buying
strike and obviously had a bit more domestic material coming on
and as the price dropped back some of that domestic stuff is now
being suspended again.”  
 The spot price has risen 13 percent since July 15 after
dropping to a 2010 low on July 13. It’s unclear whether the
gains can be attributed to fundamental buying or are driven by
traders, ING’s Hatch said.
