             (Corrects name of newspaper in first paragraph.)  
 China’s fiscal revenue may grow 13
percent to 17 percent this year, the Financial News newspaper
reported today, citing Jia Kang, head of the Ministry of
Finance’s research institute.  
 The government should also clearly announce that the
possible introduction of a property tax wouldn’t affect a
family’s first home, the newspaper reported.
