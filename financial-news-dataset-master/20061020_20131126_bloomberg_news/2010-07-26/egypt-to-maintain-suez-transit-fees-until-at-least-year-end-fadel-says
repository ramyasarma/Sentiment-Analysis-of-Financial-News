             Egypt will maintain current transit
fees for the Suez Canal, the longest man-made waterway, until at
least the end of the year, the chairman of the Suez Canal
Authority said.  
 “We will make a decision on whether or not to change the
tolls at the end of the year,”  Ahmed Fadel  told reporters in
the northeast city of Ismailia today.  
 The number of ships passing through the canal in the fiscal
year ended June 30 fell 9.6 percent to 17,504, while revenue
dropped 4.2 percent to $4.54 billion, he said.  
 Egypt depends on the waterway for foreign currency, along
with revenue from tourism and foreign direct investment. Revenue
gained in January for the first time since November 2008 as the
global economy recovered from recession.  
 “Because of the strong connection between world trade and
trade passing through the Suez Canal, the level of shipping
activity in the Suez Canal noticeably declined in 2009 from
2008,” Fadel said. “With the improvement in the shipping
industry, there has been an amelioration” of traffic.  
 In the first half of 2010, the number of ships using the
canal increased 3.3 percent from a year earlier, while revenue
climbed 13 percent, he said.  
 The maximum depth of the canal for ships was increased to
66 feet in January, Fadel said.  
 The Suez Canal and an adjacent pipeline carry more than 4
million barrels a day of crude oil, or 4.7 percent of global
output, according to New York-based McQuilling Services LLC.
