             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose after new home sales increased more than expected
in the U.S. and companies from Nippon Electric Glass Co. to
Koito Manufacturing Co. reported higher profits.  
 American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., which
counts North America as its biggest market, advanced 0.5 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Nissan Motor Co.,
a carmaker which gets 35 percent of its revenue from North
America, increased 0.3 percent. ADRs of Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s third-largest mining company, gained 0.2 percent from
the closing share price in Sydney as metal prices increased.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,535 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,490 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,530 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  advanced 0.6 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX
50 Index  gained 0.1 percent in Wellington.  
 “A jump in new home sales and better corporate earnings
raised expectations for the U.S. economic recovery, even though
the level is still low,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist
at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent
in New York today. The S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 1,115.01
yesterday after FedEx Corp., the second-largest U.S. package-
shipping company, boosted its profit forecast and a report
showing improved new-home sales eased concern the economic
recovery will stall.  
 New Home Sales  
 Sales of U.S. new homes rose in June more than forecast
following an unprecedented collapse the prior month. Purchases
increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace of 330,000,
figures from the Commerce Department showed yesterday in
Washington.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 2 percent in 2010,
compared with a drop of less than 0.1 percent by the  S&P 500  and
a 1.3 percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.2 times estimated  earnings ,
compared with 13.5 times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the
Stoxx.  
 The London Metals Exchange Index, a  measure  of six metals
including copper and zinc, climbed for six consecutive sessions,
rising 1.6 percent yesterday.  
 Nippon Electric Glass Co. , a Japanese glassmaker, said net
income for the quarter ended June 30 jumped to 24.7 billion yen
($283 million) from 832 million yen a year earlier. Sales jumped
70 percent to 106 billion yen.  
 Koito Manufacturing Co., which makes auto-parts, raised its
full-year net income forecast 18 percent to 13 billion yen,
citing an increase of eco-friendly cars.
