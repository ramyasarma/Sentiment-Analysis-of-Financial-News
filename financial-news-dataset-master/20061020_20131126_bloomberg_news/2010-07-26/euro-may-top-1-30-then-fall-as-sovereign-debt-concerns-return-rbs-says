             The  euro  may extend its increase to
$1.30 before slumping against the dollar because of continued
concern about sovereign risks to European banks after last
week’s stress tests, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  
 The general view “is that the tests weren’t rigorous
enough and haven’t eased underlying worries that the Euro area
banking system is under-capital and/or that Greece restructures
at some point,”  Melinda Burgess , a foreign-exchange strategist
in London, wrote in a note today. While the euro-dollar exchange
rate “has scope to make another break into the $1.30’s in the
near term, this doesn’t change our view that the pair is set to
head lower over the coming quarters.”  
 European regulators posted the results of bank stress tests
last week, showing seven out of 91 lenders failed and needed to
raise a combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital.  
 “There’s still a feeling that three, six or even nine
months down the line the market will still be wondering about
sovereign risks related to the European banking system,” wrote
Burgess.  
 The euro rose 0.1 percent against the dollar, trading at
$1.2927 as of 1:30 p.m. in London. It strengthened to $1.3029 on
July 20, the strongest level since May 10.
