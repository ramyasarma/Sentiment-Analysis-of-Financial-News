             Air quality in China deteriorated in
the first half, the first such decline since 2005, due in part
to a recovery in economic growth, the China Daily reported
today, citing statistics from the Ministry of Environmental
Protection.  
 In the first half, 91 percent of days in 113 Chinese cities
had air quality at the Grade II national standard or better, the
newspaper reported. That was 0.3 percentage points lower than in
the first half of 2009, according to the report.  
 The amount of inhalable particles was 0.091 milligrams per
cubic meter in the cities, rising from 0.002 milligrams a year
earlier, according to the report.  
 Increased construction and industrial projects, a surge in
automobiles and more frequent sandstorms in the spring were the
main causes of the deterioration of air quality, the newspaper
reported.
