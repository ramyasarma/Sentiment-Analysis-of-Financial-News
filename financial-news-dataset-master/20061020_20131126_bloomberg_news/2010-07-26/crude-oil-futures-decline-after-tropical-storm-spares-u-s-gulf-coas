             Crude oil closed unchanged in New
York trading as sales of new U.S. homes rose more than forecast
and Tropical Storm Bonnie dissipated without damaging production
platforms and refineries.  
 Crude rebounded from an early decline after the Commerce
Department said home purchases climbed 24 percent in June to an
annual pace of 330,000. Equities advanced on the increase, which
followed a May slump triggered by the end of a tax credit. Oil
workers returned to the Gulf after storm evacuations.  
 “We had a housing number that wasn’t as bad as some guys
have been looking for, and that was somewhat bullish for
equities, which dragged oil up,” said  Rich Ilczyszyn , a senior
market analyst with broker Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “We sold
off pretty good overnight as the storm turned into nothing.”  
 Oil for September delivery settled at $78.98 a barrel today
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, unchanged from July 23. It
was the first day since September that oil closed unchanged.
Prices are down 0.5 percent this year. Oil reached $79.30 a
barrel July 22, the highest level since May 5.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 1.1 percent to
1,115.01 as of 4:01 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 1 percent to 10,525.43.  
 “It’s going to take better macroeconomic news or perhaps
storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico to spring prices from their
narrow trading range,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker
at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London.  
 Front-month futures prices haven’t settled below $70 since
May 25 or above $80 since May 4. The 30-day range is $71.09 to
$79.60.  
 U.S. Economy  
 The U.S. economy probably expanded at a slower pace in the
second quarter as the trade deficit swelled, economists said
before reports this week.  
 Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual pace
after increasing at a 2.7 percent rate in the first quarter,
according to the median estimate of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before a July 30 Commerce Department report.  
 Earlier, crude declined to $78.06 after Bonnie degenerated
July 24. BP Plc vessels returned to the U.S. Gulf to permanently
plug a damaged well, the source of the largest oil spill in U.S.
history.  
 “You’re definitely seeing a move back after the storm
fears,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks and Opinions
LLC in Houston. “We’re trying to find a place to settle in at
after we get that out of the way.”  
 The dollar weakened for a third day against the euro,
boosting the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.
The euro increased 0.7 percent to $1.2995 from $1.2909 July 23.  
 Venezuelan Imports  
 Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said yesterday that his
country would suspend oil shipments to the U.S. if a military
attack were to be launched from Colombian territory. In a speech
on state television, he accused the U.S. of planning to
assassinate him.  
 The U.S. imported an average 851,000 barrels a day of oil
from Venezuela in April, or 8.7 percent of total imports,
according to the latest  data  from the U.S. Energy Department.
That made it the fifth-largest exporter to the U.S. that month,
after Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Nigeria.  
 Chavez cut Venezuela’s diplomatic relations with Colombia
last week after that country’s government made accusations
Venezuela is harboring as many as 87 guerilla camps used to
smuggle cocaine and launch terrorist attacks across the border.  
 Iran Sanctions  
 European Union governments imposed their toughest sanctions
yet on Iran, backing U.S. efforts to force the country to halt
uranium enrichment and stop any pursuit of nuclear weapons
capability. The sanctions include a ban on new investment in or
equipment sales to Iran’s oil and natural-gas industries.  
 Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia. Iran
pumped 3.74 million barrels a day of crude in June and has the
capacity to produce 4 million barrels a day, according to
Bloomberg estimates.  
 Hedge funds increased their net-long position in crude
futures and options on the Nymex by 11,197 to 95,652 for the
seven days ended July 20, according to the weekly Commitments of
Traders report published July 23 by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose 5 cents to $77.50 a barrel.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 299,257
contracts as of 3:42 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 391,777
contracts June 23, 45 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.24 million contracts.
