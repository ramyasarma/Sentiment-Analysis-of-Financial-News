             AT&T Inc.  said it began a fix for a
glitch in software supplied by Alcatel-Lucent SA that was
causing slower speeds in some areas of the U.S. for customers
using  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone 4 and other devices.  
 Mark Siegel , an AT&T spokesman, said in an e-mail the
Dallas-based carrier expected the issue to be resolved within
two to three weeks. AT&T said earlier this month that fewer than
2 percent of its wireless customers were affected.  
 Customers were experiencing slow responses when sending
data such as photos or e-mail from their devices,  Alcatel-Lucent 
said earlier this month.  
 Siegel declined to comment on how much the project will
cost. Two percent of AT&T’s 90.1 million wireless subscribers
works out to 1.8 million people.  
 AT&T added 42 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $25.96 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , for the highest
closing price since May 3. The shares have lost 7.4 percent this
year.
