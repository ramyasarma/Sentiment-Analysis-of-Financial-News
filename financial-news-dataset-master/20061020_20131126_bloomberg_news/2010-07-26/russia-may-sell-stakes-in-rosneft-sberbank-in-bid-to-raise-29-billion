             Russia may raise 883.5 billion
rubles ($29 billion) to help cover its budget deficit by selling
minority stakes in 10 companies including OAO Rosneft, the
country’s largest oil producer, the Finance Ministry said.  
 The ministry also proposes the sale of holdings in pipeline
operator OAO Transneft, Russia’s two largest lenders,  OAO
Sberbank  and VTB Group, OAO Russian Railways, shipper OAO
Sovcomflot, the OAO RusHydro utility, Russian Agricultural Bank
and OAO Agency for Housing Mortgage Lending. The 2011-2013
privatization plan must be approved by the government, and will
be discussed at its next meeting.  
 The government is seeking to boost revenue to narrow the
budget deficit, which this year may reach 2.4 trillion rubles
($76.9 billion), equal to 5.4 percent of gross domestic product,
the government said on June 10. Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said on June 18 that Russia may raise 72 billion
rubles from this year’s government asset sales.  
 “Privatization is a measure of last resort for deficit
financing, and with state debt at around 7-8 percent of  GDP , we
view the sale of state assets as premature,” Alfa Bank analysts
including  Natalia Orlova  and  Pavel Sorokin  said in a note to
investors today. “As the government is planning to sell only
minority rather than strategic stakes, the ultimate decision
will be sensitive to market conditions.”  
 ‘Maximizing Value’  
 The Vedomosti newspaper reported details of the asset sale
today. The  report  was confirmed by a Finance Ministry official,
who declined to be identified in line with ministry rules.  
 Rosneft isn’t in formal talks with the government about a
share sale, said company Vice President  Peter O’Brien .  
 “No concrete discussions have been had yet with the
company,” O’Brien said by telephone. “Clearly it would make
sense to do after reform of the tax regime, in terms of
maximizing value to the state.”  
 The government said last year it sought to sell state
energy and transport holdings, earmarked about 5,500 enterprises
for divestment and pledged to sell shares in companies that are
already publicly traded. Stakes lined up for sale included as
much as 25 percent of Sovcomflot, Chief Executive Officer  Sergei Frank  said on Dec. 28.  
 ‘All Major Banks’  
 The Economy Ministry began talks with “all major banks”
including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch
unit, UBS AG and Troika Dialog to choose consultants for the
privatization,  Alexei Uvarov , head of the Economy Ministry’s
property department, said on April 27.  
 “The Finance Ministry will still have to give preference
to borrowing as the primary source of deficit financing,”
Moscow-based Alfa Bank said. “The government is in a good
position to attract additional debt.”  
 Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said on July 12 that Russia’s
budget deficit may  shrink  to less than 5 percent of GDP this
year from 5.9 percent in 2009, as the world’s biggest energy
exporter recovers from a record 7.9 percent contraction last
year. The shortfall is set to narrow to 3.6 percent next year,
2.4 percent in 2012 and 1.5 percent in 2013, Deputy Finance
Minister  Sergei Storchak  said last month.  
 The government may earn 298 billion rubles from asset sales
next year, 276.1 billion rubles in 2012 and 309.4 billion in
2013, the Finance Ministry official said.  
 The deficit was 2.3 trillion rubles, or 5.9 percent of GDP,
at the end of 2009, the first shortfall since 1999.  
 Russia plans to borrow 1.5 trillion rubles next year, 1.3
trillion rubles in 2012 and 931 billion rubles in 2013, Storchak
said, citing preliminary estimates in the government’s borrowing
program. The country will meet 90 percent of its borrowing needs
on the domestic market, he said.
