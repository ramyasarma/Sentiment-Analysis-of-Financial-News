             Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to
Chicago futures as warm, wet weather hastened development of the
2010 crop, reducing demand for supplies harvested last year.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybean delivery in
July dropped to 77 cents to 90 cents a bushel above August
futures from 80 cents to 90 cents on July 23, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium for delivery this month
was 32 cents to 34 cents above September futures, down from 32
cents to 35 cents on July 23.  
 “There is enough commercial ownership to fill barges,”
with harvesting likely to start in early September, said  Scott Stoller , a grain merchandiser for Michlig Agricenter Inc. in
Manlius, Illinois. “The crops look great, so no one is
interested in buying last year’s supplies.”  
 Soybean futures for August delivery fell 18.75 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $9.9825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest drop for the contract since June 4. The price on
July 16 reached $10.27, the highest level for the contract since
Jan. 8.  
 Corn futures for September delivery fell 7.25 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.64 a bushel, the biggest decline since July 20.
The contact fell 6 percent last week, snapping a three-week
rally.  
 The USDA inspected 42.421 million bushels of corn for
export last week, down 23 percent from the same week a year
earlier, the government said today in a report. Soybean
inspections totaled 6.595 million bushels, down 32 percent from
a week earlier and 29 percent smaller than a year ago, USDA data
show.  
 “Most exports have been covered until we start harvesting
late next month,” Stoller said. “The warm weather has pushed
crops as much as three weeks ahead.”
