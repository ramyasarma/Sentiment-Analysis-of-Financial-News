             Advent International Corp. and Bain
Capital LLC are seeking 1.35 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) of
loans to fund their bid to buy  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc ’s credit-card payment processing unit, two people familiar
with the matter said.  
 Lenders led by RBS, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
arranging the financing, which includes about 400 million pounds
of mezzanine debt, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private.  
 Spokesmen for Advent and Bain declined to comment.  
 The deal would add to $5.3 billion of buyout financing
underwritten in Europe this year, 53 percent more than during
the same period last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. RBS, taken over by the U.K. government in 2008 after
credit losses forced it to seek a bailout, is the most active
underwriter of all types of leveraged loans in Europe.  
 Advent and Bain, both based in Boston, entered exclusive
talks with  RBS  to buy WorldPay, people with knowledge of the
matter said on July 23. An agreement may be announced by Aug. 6.  
 Private-equity firms pay for takeovers by loading a target
company with debt and using its cash flow to repay lenders. The
borrowings are considered leveraged, or below BBB- by Standard &
Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  
 WorldPay operates in more than 40 countries and provides
credit-card payment processing services to clients including
small- and medium-sized businesses. It’s among the 10 largest
processors of online payments in the U.S., according to RBS’s
website.
