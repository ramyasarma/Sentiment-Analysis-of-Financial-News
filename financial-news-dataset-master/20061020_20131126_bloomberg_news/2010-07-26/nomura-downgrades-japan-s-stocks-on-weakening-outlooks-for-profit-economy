             Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s
largest brokerage, cut its recommendation on Japanese shares to
“neutral,” citing a weaker profit outlook and slower economic-
growth prospects.  
 “The recovery in Japanese earnings is already beginning to
lose momentum,” Nomura analysts including  Ian Scott  wrote in an
e-mailed report dated July 23. The brokerage also today
downgraded its forecast for growth in the country as a
strengthening yen threatens the export-fueled rebound.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  has slid 14 percent this
fiscal year on concern the European debt crisis will reduce
earnings for exporters in the world’s second-largest economy.
Nomura said gains in corporate profits have not matched the
speed at which they tumbled in the global recession, and
recommends higher allocations than before in emerging markets
and Europe excluding the U.K.  
 Japan’s economy will expand 2.6 percent this fiscal year
and 1.5 percent in the year ending March 2012, revised down from
previous forecasts of 2.7 percent and 2.1 percent growth,
according to Nomura. Slower growth abroad and a stronger
currency will damp the recovery in exports, and may prompt the
Bank of Japan to ease policy further to support the economy, the
report said.  
 The central bank may resort to “more extreme measures”
such as increasing its purchases of public debt as the
government steps up its calls for additional easing, Nomura said.
