             Dubai shares advanced for the first
time in three days as  Arabtec Holding PJSC  signed a construction
accord and  Aramex PJSC  said profit rose.  
 The  Dubai Financial Market General Index  gained 0.2 percent
to 1,509.66.  Arabtec , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest builder,
advanced for the first time this week and  Aramex , the Middle
East’s biggest courier company, climbed to the highest level in
almost four months. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index of 200 shares in
the Gulf and  Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark index rose less than 0.1
percent.  
 “GCC markets are struggling to generate strong catalysts
to attract investors,” said  Ali Khan , head of cash-equity
trading at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. Markets rose due to
“random price action rather than something specific,” he said.  
 Crude oil declined for a second day, falling 0.3 percent to
$78.71 a barrel at 5:15 p.m. in Dubai. The six countries that
make up the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, together supply
about 20 percent of the world’s oil. In Dubai, 63.1 million
shares traded today, about a third of the six-month daily
average of 175 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Arabtec  rose 1.2 percent to 1.76 dirhams. The company
signed an accord with Khoie Properties for the construction of
the La Hoya Bay Development. The total value of the project is
estimated at 2.5 billion dirhams ($680 million) and it will be
built in phases over 54 months.  
 Aramex  added 1.8 percent to 1.70 dirhams, the highest level
since April 1. Second-quarter profit increased 10 percent to 55
million dirhams as freight services grew in Europe and India.  
 Kuwait’s benchmark stock index advanced 0.6 percent and
Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  rose 0.7 percent.
Bahrain’s  index  slipped 0.3 percent, the  QE Index  in Qatar lost
0.8 percent, while Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  was little changed.
