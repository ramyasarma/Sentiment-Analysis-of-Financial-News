             The new Slovak government will
support the construction of a nuclear reactor in a joint venture
with  CEZ AS  as long as the state won’t need to co-finance the
project, the Economy Ministry said.  
 The Cabinet of previous Slovak Premier  Robert Fico , who
stepped down earlier this month, in 2008 picked the Czech
Republic’s largest energy company as a partner to build a
nuclear unit in Jaslovske Bohunice, western Slovakia.  
 While in opposition, the current government parties
criticized the selection, saying Fico’s administration didn’t
hold a tender for the partner. The construction may cost between
4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) and 6 billion euros, and CEZ has
a 49 percent share in a joint venture with state-owned JAVYS
holding the rest.  
 “The project will continue and it’s up to CEZ to get the
money,” Economy Ministry spokesman  Robert Merva  said in a phone
interview from Bratislava today. “The state will provide the
land, but it won’t co-finance the project neither guarantee any
borrowing by the venture.”  
 The project is currently going through a feasibility study
that will by March 2011 determine the number of reactors to be
built as well as their capacity. The construction is set to
begin by 2014 and be completed six years later.  
 Fico’s administration supported construction of new nuclear
plants as part of a plan to make Slovakia self-sufficient in
power supplies. The new unit will be built at the site of an
existing nuclear plant, where  Slovenske Elektrarne AS , which is
controlled by Italy’s Enel SpA, already operates two reactors.
