             Brazil’s central bank will begin
cutting the benchmark lending rate next year, reversing much of
this year’s increases, according to Nomura Securities.  
 Policy makers will start lowering the overnight rate target
in the second quarter of 2011 and bring it to 10 percent by the
end of the year, Tony Volpon, a Latin America strategist at
Nomura, said in a note to clients. Nomura had previously
forecast a year-end 2011 rate of 11.5 percent.
