             OAO Mechel , Russia’s largest
producer of coal used in steel-making, climbed the most in two
months in Moscow after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  publicly
apologized for rebuking the company over prices in 2008.  
 Putin regrets his criticism of Mechel, he said on July 23
at a meeting with metals oligarchs in Chelyabinsk that was
broadcast on national television. His original criticism
contributed to Mechel’s share price falling more than 20 percent
in the space of a day.  
 Shares  in Mechel rose as much as 6.5 percent to 680 rubles
($22.40) on the Micex exchange in Moscow today, the most since
May 26. They traded 1 percent higher at 645 rubles at 1:40 p.m.
local time.  
 Putin’s July 23 comments came after trading closed at 6:45
p.m. local time in Moscow. In New York that day, Mechel climbed
7.7 percent to $22.23 a depositary receipt.
