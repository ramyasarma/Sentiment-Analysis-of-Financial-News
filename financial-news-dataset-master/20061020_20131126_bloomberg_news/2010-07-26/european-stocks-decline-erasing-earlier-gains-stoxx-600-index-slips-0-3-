             European stocks declined as a
selloff in drugmakers overshadowed results of bank stress tests
that showed the majority of the region’s lenders are adequately
capitalized.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.3 percent to 255.14 at
2:42 p.m. in London, having earlier risen as much as 0.5
percent.
