             Nomura Securities Co. cut forecasts
for the dollar against the yen, citing a slowing U.S. economy
and expectations the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates
until the first half of 2011.  
 Nomura expects the dollar to trade at 90 yen by the third
quarter of this year from 95 yen previously, it said in a
research note dated yesterday. The greenback will finish 2010 at
87.5 yen from an earlier estimate of 97 yen. The brokerage left
its fourth-quarter 2011 forecast unchanged at 90 yen.
