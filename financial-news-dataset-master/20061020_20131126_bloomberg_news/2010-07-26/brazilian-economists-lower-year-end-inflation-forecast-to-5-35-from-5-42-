             Analysts covering Brazil’s economy
cut their year-end forecast for the benchmark lending rate by a
quarter point in a weekly central bank  survey  after policy
makers last week said inflation risks have dropped.  
 The central bank’s eight-member board, led by  Henrique Meirelles , will raise the Selic to 11.75 percent by year end,
compared with a week earlier forecast of 12 percent, according
to the median forecast in a July 23 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today.  
 Policy makers meeting July 20-21 raised the overnight rate
to 10.75 percent from 10.25 percent, surprising 48 of 51
economists, who expected a 75 basis-point increase.  
 Consumer price  inflation will end 2010 at 5.35 percent,
compared with a week earlier forecast of 5.42 percent, the
survey shows. The forecast for 12-month inflation was cut to
4.93 percent, down from 4.96 percent, according to the survey.  
 The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7697 per U.S. dollar at 8:11
a.m. New York time, from 1.7738 on July 23. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January 2012 was unchanged at 11.70 percent.
