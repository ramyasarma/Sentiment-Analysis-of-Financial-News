             Emirates NBD PJSC, which reported a
53 percent decline in second-quarter profit, said the debt
restructuring at state-owned Dubai World was progressing
“satisfactorily” and the bank has not booked any specific
provisions for impaired loans to the company until now.  
 Emirates NBD, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by
assets, is one of the seven biggest lenders to Dubai World and
reached a preliminary deal with the holding company to
restructure $14.4 billion of bank debt on May 20.  
 About two-thirds of the loans to Saudi Arabia’s Saad and
Algosaibi business groups have been provided for, Emirates NBD
said in its second-quarter results presentation today.  
 The bank said earlier today second-quarter profit dropped
to 398.2 million dirhams ($108 million) from 852 million
dirhams, a year earlier. That fell short of the median estimate
of four analysts for a profit of 614 million dirhams, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.
