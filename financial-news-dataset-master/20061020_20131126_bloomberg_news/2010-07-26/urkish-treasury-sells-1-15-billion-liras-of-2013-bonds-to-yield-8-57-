             Turkey’s Treasury sold 1.15 billion
liras ($757 million) of 2013 10 percent bonds in an auction
today to yield an annual 8.57 percent, according to central bank
data.  
 The Treasury sold a nominal 620.7 million liras of the
paper to investors in the auction and a further 528.8 million
liras in an earlier non-competitive sale to so-called primary
dealers made up of the largest banks and state institutions.  
 Bids totalled 4.64 billion liras, the bank said.
