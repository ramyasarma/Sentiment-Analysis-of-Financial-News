             Fibria Celulose SA , the world’s
largest pulp producer, was raised to “market perform” from
“underperform” at Itau Unibanco Holding SA, which said the
stock price already reflects a “weaker” price outlook for the
papermaking raw material.  
 Fibria also may benefit from a potential sale of its paper
business, analysts  Marcos Assumpcao  and  Alexandre Miguel  wrote
in a note to clients July 23.
