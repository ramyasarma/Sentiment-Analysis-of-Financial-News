             Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, a lender
bailed out by the country’s central bank last year, returned to
profit in the first half through June.  
 Net income was 11.3 billion naira compared to a loss of
87.6 billion naira a year earlier, the bank said in a statement
e-mailed by the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange today.  
 Revenue declined to 66.9 billion naira from 86.1 billion
naira last year, it said.
