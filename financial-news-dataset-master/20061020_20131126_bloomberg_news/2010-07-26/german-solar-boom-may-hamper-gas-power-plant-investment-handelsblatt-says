             The boom in solar energy in Germany
may hamper investment in gas-power plants, jeopardizing the
nation’s system of power production, Handelsblatt reported.  
 Gas power plants deliver power when solar panels can’t
produce due to lack of sunlight, the newspaper said, citing
Helmuth Groscurth of the Arrhenius Institute for Energy and
Climate Policy.  
 If investment in gas plants shrinks, Germany may lack that
supplementary energy production, Handelsblatt added.
