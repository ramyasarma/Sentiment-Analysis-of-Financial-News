             China’s home prices may decline by
as much as 15 percent in the next six to 12 months as more
supply becomes available, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  
 HSBC lowered its stock recommendations on Agile Property
Holdings Ltd., Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. and Shimao Property
Holdings Ltd. to “underweight” from “overweight.” The
brokerage cut its rating for Sino-Ocean Land Holdings Ltd. to
“underweight” from “neutral.”  
 It’s “too early to start bottom fishing,” according to
the brokerage in a report. “Market indicators do not rule out
possibility of further tightening measures.”
