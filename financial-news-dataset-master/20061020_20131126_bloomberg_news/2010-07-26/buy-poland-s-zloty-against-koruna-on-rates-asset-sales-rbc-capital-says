             Investors should buy the zloty
against the Czech koruna as the Polish currency may gain because
of potential for interest rate increases in Poland and state
asset sales, RBC Capital wrote in a note to clients today.  
 The zloty may advance to 6.5 koruna, the bank said in an e-
mailed note. The Polish currency strengthened 0.5 percent to
6.2203 koruna as of 9:57 a.m. in Warsaw.
