             German government debt and other
“safe” bonds will strengthen this summer on concern over the
credibility of European bank stress test results published last
week, according to High Frequency Economics.  
 “With investors unconvinced by the bank stress tests, we
think people will move money into safe bonds rather than risk
holding their wealth in banks or stocks,” wrote  Carl Weinberg ,
chief economist in Valhalla, New York, in a note dated today.
“That means we expect some yield curves, like Germany’s, to
rally and flatten this summer. The ECB will not raise rates
anytime soon.”  
 The 10-year German bond yielded 2.72 percent at 8:14 a.m.
in London, up one basis point. Two-year securities were little
changed, yielding 0.75 percent.
