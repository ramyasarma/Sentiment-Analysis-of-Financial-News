             Moderate yuan moves can help to
adjust trade and international payment unbalances, Hu Xiaolian,
a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, said in a
statement posted to the central bank’s website today.  
 Better balancing of trade and international payments can
help realize stable and sustainable economic growth and more
stable and orderly growth on money supply, Hu said.  
 Moderate adjustments of the yuan can also ease pressure
from inflows of foreign exchange and ease overly rapid growth of
China’s foreign exchange reserves, Hu said.
