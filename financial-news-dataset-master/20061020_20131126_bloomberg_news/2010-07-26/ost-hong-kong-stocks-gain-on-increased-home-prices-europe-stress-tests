             Most  Hong Kong stocks  rose, lifting
the benchmark index to the highest level in a month, after the
city’s home prices climbed and European banks’ stress test
results fueled optimism for a global economic recovery.  
 New World Development Ltd., a Hong Kong-based developer,
climbed 0.7 percent. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest bank by
market value, climbed 0.9 percent. Standard Chartered Plc, a
London-based bank, advanced 1.2 percent.  Citic Resources
Holdings Ltd. , the Chinese metals producer turned energy
supplier, rose 12 percent after renewing an application to sell
shares in its manganese unit. China Construction Bank Corp.
slipped 0.8 percent on concern that loans to local governments
may not be repaid.  
 The stress tests “might not be vigorous enough as the
tests are performed after recapitalization for the banks, but it
is a piece of slightly positive news for the investing public,”
said  Pu Yonghao , the Hong Kong-based chief investment strategist
for the Asia Pacific region at UBS Wealth Management, which
oversees $190 billion. “The stress tests results remove market
uncertainties in Asia.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  advanced 0.1 percent to 20,839.91, its
highest since June 23. About eight stocks gained for every five
that fell among the gauge’s 43 constituents. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
fell 0.3 percent to 11,875.03.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 4.7 percent this year as
China’s efforts to cool its property market and Europe’s debt
crises dented confidence in the global economy. Stocks on the
gauge trade at  13.8 times  estimated earnings, Bloomberg data
show, down from 17.2 times at the beginning of the year.  
 Property Prices Advance  
 New World rose 0.7 percent to HK$14.26. Hang Lung
Properties Ltd., a Hong Kong-based developer, climbed 1.2
percent to HK$33.45.  Henderson Land Development Co. , a developer
controlled by the city’s second-richest man, increased 1.5
percent to HK$49.40.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the world’s
biggest developer by market value, gained 0.8 percent to
HK$114.80.  
 Sun Hung Kai sold 300 flats at an apartment project in Hong
Kong’s Island South district over the past two weekends. The
sale at the Larvotto project has brought in a total of HK$8
billion ($1.03 billion) in revenue for Sun Hung Kai and partners
Kerry Properties Ltd. and Paliburg Holdings Ltd., said  Victor Lui , an executive director at Sun Hung Kai’s agency arm.  
 Stress Test Results  
 Hong Kong’s home prices rose 0.35 percent for the week
ended July 18 to the highest level since 1997, Centaline
Property Agency Ltd. reported July 23. The city’s home prices
have gained 9.6 percent this year, Centaline’s data show.
Centaline is one of the city’s biggest property-services
companies.  
 The  Hang Seng Property Index ’s 1 percent gain was the
sharpest among the four industry groups tracked by the benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  
 HSBC climbed 0.9 percent to HK$77.55.  Standard Chartered 
gained 1.2 percent to HK$218.  
 European regulators found that seven out of 91 banks need
to raise a combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital.
Germany’s Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of
Greece SA and five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate
reserves to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6
percent in the event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis,
lenders and regulators said July 23.  
 ‘Not Rigorous Enough’  
 Before the results were published, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimated that lenders would need to raise 38
billion euros. Part of the reason the amount of capital needed
was lower than analysts predicted may be because the evaluations
took into account potential losses only on government bonds the
banks trade, rather than those they are holding to maturity.
That means the tests ignored the majority of banks’ holdings of
sovereign debt.  
 “The test isn’t rigorous enough,”  Steve Bernstein , chief
executive officer of Oppenheimer Investment Asia Ltd. said in an
interview in Hong Kong. “The fact that they only look at one
part of the portfolio isn’t enough. The test should have looked
at the banks’ investment portfolio as well.”  
 Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s third-largest lender by
market value, fell 0.5 percent to HK$4.13. China Construction
Bank fell 0.8 percent to HK$6.54.  
 Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent of
the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent to finance
local government infrastructure projects, according to a person
with knowledge of data collected by the nation’s regulator.  
 Citic Resources  jumped 11.8 percent to HK$1.70, the most in
more than a year in Hong Kong trading after renewing an
application to sell shares in Citic Dameng Holdings, its
manganese unit, according to a statement filed to the Hong Kong
exchange on July 25.  
 United Laboratories International Holdings Ltd., a maker of
pharmaceutical products, rose 7.7 percent to HK$12.04, the
highest in more than three years, after saying it expects first-
half profit to increase by about 3.5 times from a year earlier.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 0.4 percent to 20,836.
