             About 27 percent of crude-oil
production in the Gulf of Mexico and 10 percent of natural-gas
output is still idle because of Tropical Storm Bonnie, the U.S.
government reported.  
 Oil and gas producers report that one rig and three
production platforms remain evacuated, the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said today in a
 statement  on its  website . About 428,000 barrels of daily oil
production are shut-in, along with 618 million cubic feet of
gas.  
 “Offshore oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico are
reboarding platforms and rigs and restoring production following
Tropical Storm Bonnie,” said the bureau, which is part of the
U.S. Interior Department.  
 Yesterday, about 47 percent of oil and 22 percent of gas
production in the Gulf was reported shut-in. Bonnie, the second
tropical storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, dissipated
July 24, according to the National Hurricane Center.  
 The Gulf produced 1.6 million barrels of oil and 6.4
billion cubic feet of gas a day in March, according to the
bureau. The report on shut-in production is based on responses
from 26 companies as of 12:30 p.m. New York time.  
 The Gulf of Mexico hosts about 31 percent of U.S. oil
output and about 10 percent of gas production, according to the
Energy Department.
