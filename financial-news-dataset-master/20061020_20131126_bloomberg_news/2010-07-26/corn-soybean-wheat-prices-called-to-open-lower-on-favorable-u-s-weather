             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain in the past three
days improves conditions for plants, said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. More precipitation in the next 10 days was forecast.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower
before a government report today is expected to show improving
U.S. crop conditions after rain replenished soil moisture, Grow
said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent
a pound lower, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that rain boosted the yield
potential of the U.S. spring crop in the northern Great Plains,
Grow said.
