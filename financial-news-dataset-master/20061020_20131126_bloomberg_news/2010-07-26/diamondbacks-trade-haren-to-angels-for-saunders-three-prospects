             The Arizona Diamondbacks traded
three-time All-Star pitcher  Dan Haren  to the Los Angeles Angels
for left-hander  Joe Saunders  and three prospects.  
 Saunders, a 2008 All-Star, was 54-32 in six Major League
Baseball seasons with the Angels. He’s 6-10 this season with a
4.52 earned run average in 20 starts.  
 Saunders “brings an element to our club that I think we
need,” Diamondbacks interim General Manager Jerry Dipoto said
in a statement yesterday. “The prospects involved in the deal
bring us talent that we need to build with and therefore, I felt
like this deal checked a lot of boxes.”  
 The Diamondbacks also acquired minor league reliever  Rafael Rodriguez , starter Patrick Corbin and a player to be named.  
 Haren, a California native, is 7-8 with a 4.60 ERA in 141
innings this season, with 141 strikeouts and 29 walks.  
 Haren, 29, will be paid $12.75 million over each of the
next two seasons and $15.5 million for the option in 2013, while
Saunders will earn $3.7 million in 2010, MLB.com reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Right-hander Rodriguez, 25, pitched 18 games in his first
major league season in 2009, with no wins and one loss and a
5.58 ERA. He spent most of this season with Triple-A Salt Lake
where he was 5-3 with 10 saves in 50 1/3 innings.  
 Corbin, 21, is 8-0 with a 3.86 ERA in nine starts in Class
A.
