             Chinese tourism companies advanced
in Shanghai and Shenzhen trading after the government announced
plans to offer financial support to the industry.  
 China Travel International Investment Hong Kong Ltd.  surged
6.9 percent to HK$1.85 in Hong Kong trading, the most in eight
months.  Guilin Tourism Corp. , which takes visitors to the karst
mountains of southern China’s Guangxi province, rose 1.4 percent
to 10.19 yuan in Shenzhen trading, while  Emei Shan Tourism Co. 
rose 3.8 percent.  
 Financing support will be extended to tourism companies and
projects by setting reasonable loan periods and rates, the State
Council, the nation’s cabinet, said in a  statement  on a
government website. Companies will also be encouraged to sell
bonds and shares to raise funds, it said.  
 Tourism companies with foreign ownership or investment will
be allowed on a trial basis to operate tours for Chinese
citizens traveling outside the country, the statement said.  
 Beijing Jingxi Tourism Development Co.  rose 1.3 percent to
13.84 yuan and  Huatian Hotel Group Co.  increased 1 percent.
