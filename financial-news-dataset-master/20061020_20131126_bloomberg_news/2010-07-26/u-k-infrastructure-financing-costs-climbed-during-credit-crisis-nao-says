             The cost of financing U.K.
infrastructure projects rose as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.55
billion) during the credit crisis, the government auditor said.  
 The interest rate on Private Finance Initiative projects,
used to build roads, schools and hospitals, climbed on average
to about 7 percent from 6 percent, the National Audit Office
said in a report published in London today. The extra cost will
be spread over the 30-year financing lifetime of the plans.  
 The Treasury intervened in 2009 to maintain lending to the
projects as private sources of finance dried up, the NAO said.
It urged the government to explore new funding now the crisis
has subsided.  
 Financing last year “was value for money, but there is no
guarantee that it will remain that way,” Auditor General Amyas
Morse said in a statement. “A project-by-project review should
be carried out using stricter criteria to establish the most
appropriate funding methods.”  
 The U.K. invested about 30 billion pounds annually in
infrastructure over the last five years and that figure is
likely to increase to as much as 50 billion by 2030, the NAO
said. PFI projects are commissioned by the state and executed
and financed by private companies over several years.
