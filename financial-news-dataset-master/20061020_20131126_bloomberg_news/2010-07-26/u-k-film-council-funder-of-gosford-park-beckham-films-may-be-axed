             The U.K. Film Council , which helped
fund movies including “The Last King of Scotland,” “Gosford
Park” and “Bend it Like Beckham,” may be dissolved under cost-
cutting measures announced by the government  today .  
 Scrapping the Council, which employs 75 people, would also
improve efficiency and transparency and introduce a direct and
“less bureaucratic” relationship between the government and
the British Film Institute, which promotes film and television
culture, Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said in a statement.  
 “Many of these bodies were set up a considerable length of
time ago, and times and demands have changed,” Hunt said.  
 The Film Council, which has invested more than 160 million
pounds ($248 million) in 900-plus pictures since it was
established 10 years ago, condemned the move and said filmmakers
need more support than ever as they move to digital technology.  
 “Abolishing the most successful film support organization
the U.K. has ever had is a bad decision, imposed without any
consultation or evaluation,” Chairman  Tim Bevan  said in a
statement. “People will rightly look back on today’s
announcement and say it was a big mistake, driven by short-term
thinking and political expediency.”
