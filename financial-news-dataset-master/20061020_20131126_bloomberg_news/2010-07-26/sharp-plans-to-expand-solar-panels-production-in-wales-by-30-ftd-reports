             Sharp Corp.  is increasing
investments in solar energy and wants to expand its panel
production in Wales by 30 percent,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing an interview with Hiroshi Sasaoka, chief of
European operations.  
 Sharp had 7.6 percent of its sales in the solar energy
sector last year and aims to increase that figure to 25 percent,
