             Central Rand Gold Ltd.,  the South
African producer of the metal, is a takeover target because its
share price has fallen more than 90 percent since it first sold
shares to the public about three years ago,  Business Report 
said. The Johannesburg-based newspaper cited BP Bernstein
analyst Makwe Masilela.
