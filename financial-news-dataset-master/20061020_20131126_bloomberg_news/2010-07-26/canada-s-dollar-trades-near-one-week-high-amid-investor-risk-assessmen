             Canada’s dollar reached the highest
level in more than a week versus the greenback as gains in U.S.
stocks supported demand for currencies tied to economic growth.  
 The Canadian currency strengthened for a third day as
equities gained after a report showed new home sales in the U.S.
beat estimates. Home purchases in the U.S. increased 24 percent
in June to an annual pace of 330,000, a report from the Commerce
Department showed today.  
 “Looks like people are happy to take on risk as we begin
the week,” said  John Curran , a Toronto-based senior vice
president at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange
dealer.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, climbed as
much as 0.5 percent to C$1.0303 per U.S. dollar, the strongest
level since C$1.0284 on July 15, before trading at C$1.0319 at
5:06 p.m. in Toronto. The loonie closed at C$1.0358 on July 23.
One Canadian dollar buys 96.91 U.S. cents.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  gained 1.1 percent. Global
package-delivery companies FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service
Inc. lifted earnings forecasts. Both are considered harbingers
for global growth.  
 Futures on crude oil were little changed at $78.99 a barrel
after reaching $79.30 a barrel on July 22, the highest level on
a closing basis since May 5.  
 The Canadian dollar tends to rise and fall with commodity
prices as a proxy for risk appetite. Canada’s currency is 82
percent correlated to movements in crude and 91 percent
correlated to swings in the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg
data. A 100 percent correlation would mean the measures move in
lockstep.  
 Rates Favor Loonie  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  on June 1 became the
first Group of Seven central banker since July 2008 to lift
borrowing costs, increasing the benchmark rate to 0.5 percent.
Carney raised the target rate for overnight loans between
commercial banks to 0.75 percent on July 20.  
 “Expect interest-rate differentials to favor the Canadian
dollar,”  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at online currency-trading
firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto, said in an e-mail. “Technically
the currency is looking to close higher as long as we close
below this C$1.0424 level.”  
 The Federal Reserve left its key rate at virtually zero
last month and renewed a pledge to keep it low for an “extended
period.” Minutes of the June 22-23 session, released July 14,
show officials saw no need to boost stimulus, while paring their
growth forecasts and noting risks to the recovery had increased.  
 The Canadian 10-year note’s  yield  was unchanged at 3.23
percent.  
 Foreign-Exchange Increases  
 The average daily turnover of foreign exchange, which
includes spot transactions, outright forwards and foreign
exchange swaps, increased 9.4 percent to $57 billion in April,
compared with $52.1 billion in October, according to the
Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee. April’s turnover totaled
$1.2 trillion, compared with $1.1 trillion in October.  
 On an average daily basis, the volume of spot and outright
forwards increased by 33 percent and 20 percent, the committee’s
 Foreign Exchange Volume Survey  said today. Foreign exchange
swaps decreased 1 percent.  
 “We are coming off a post-crisis stage,”  Firas Askari ,
head currency trader in Toronto at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets, said. “You would expect to see an uptick as
markets see a semblance of improvement.”  
 The Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee, chaired by the
Bank of Canada, surveys senior representatives from eight of the
nation’s largest banks in April and October each year to provide
information on the size and structure of Canada’s foreign-
exchange market.
