             The euro may “make another
attempt” at breaching $1.30 amid a stronger recovery in the
euro area than investors anticipated, Commerzbank AG said.  
 “European data has surprised on the upside recently,” a
team of Commerzbank analysts led by Frankfurt-based Ulrich Leuchtmann wrote in a note to clients today. Still, for the
level “to be breached on a sustainable level, the U.S. data
would have to disappoint once again,” they wrote.  
 The euro was little changed at $1.2911 as of 11:55 a.m. in
London. It strengthened to $1.3029 on July 20, the strongest
level since May 10.
