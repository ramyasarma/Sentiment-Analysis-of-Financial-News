             OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil
producer, said second-quarter profit advanced 60 percent on
higher oil prices and output.  
 Net income climbed to $2.56 billion from $1.59 billion in
the same period the previous year, the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The company didn’t provide net
attributable to shareholders, which was $1.61 billion a year
earlier and was forecast to reach $2.64 billion, according to
the average estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg News.  
 “Results were marginally positive,”  Maria Radina , an oil
and gas analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by telephone from
Moscow today. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation
and amortization “could be stronger but Rosneft refining output
was down due to maintenance works.”  
 The earnings, known as Ebitda, rose 33 percent to $4.75
billion, while sales increased 41 percent to $15.4 billion,
Rosneft said.  
 Crude production rose 8.8 percent to 2.32 million barrels a
day after the start of the Vankor and Verkhnechonsk fields,
Rosneft said. The Vankor field at peak may provide the
equivalent of 5 percent of Russia’s current output.  
 Refining Decline  
 Refining operations fell 7.5 percent compared with the
previous quarter, with output at 11.2 million metric tons of
petroleum products, the company said, without giving a year-
earlier comparison.  
 The price of  Urals  blend, Russia’s benchmark crude export,
rose 31 percent compared with the previous year to $76.66 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Transportation costs in the first half gained 40 percent
compared with the previous year to $3.5 billion because of
rising state tariff.  
 “Cost increases have been continuing now for a number of
years, well above inflation, and now are affecting upstream
investment decisions,” Rosneft Vice President Peter O’Brien
said today in a telephone interview. “Transit costs can be a
straw breaking a camel’s back.”  
 Rosneft decreased net debt to $15.8 billion, or 15 percent
less than at the end of the first quarter, on free cash flow of
$2.8 billion, the Moscow-based company said.  
 “This is phenomenal,”  Luis Saenz , London-based director
of international sales at brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed note. Moscow-based Renaissance Capital had
estimated net debt would decline to $17.5 billion.  
 Rosneft said capital expenditures reached $3.85 billion in
the first half, 14 percent higher than a year earlier.
