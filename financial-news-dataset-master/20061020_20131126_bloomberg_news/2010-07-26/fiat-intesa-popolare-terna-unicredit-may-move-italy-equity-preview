             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index
increased 215.88, or 1.1 percent, to 20,819.96 in Milan, erasing
a 0.4 percent drop on July 23.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Banco Popolare SC (BP IM) advanced 20 cents, or 4.4
percent, to 4.79 euros, erasing its loss on July 23. The bank,
which was one of five Italian lenders that passed the stress
test, will sell “non-strategic” assets in the second half of
the year to improve its Tier 1 capital ratio, Chief Executive
Officer  Pierfrancesco Saviotti  said in an interview with Il Sole
24 Ore newspaper. Intermonte SIM SpA upgraded the stock to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) surged 9.75 cents, or 4.1
percent, to 2.50 euros. “Intesa is the clear winner of the
stress test,” Equita SIM SpA said in a note on Italian banks.
The brokerage has a “hold” rating on Italy’s second-biggest
lender.  
 STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM) fell 12 cents, or 1.9
percent, to 6.32 euros, extending losses of 4.6 percent on July
23. Kepler Capital Markets, which has a “reduce” rating on
Europe’s largest semiconductor maker, said in a note that the
“ST-Ericsson joint venture’s painful recovery could cap the
shares in the short term.”  
 Natixis Securities downgraded the stock to “neutral” from
“buy.”  
 Tod’s SpA  (TOD IM) fell for the first time in five days,
losing 1.30 euros, or 2.2 percent, to 59.03 euros. Natixis
Securities, which has a “neutral” rating on the Italian
luxury-goods maker known for its rubber-studded driving shoes,
said in a note “multiples for Tod’s are in line with those of
the sector, whereas its earnings-per-share growth outlook for
2009-12 is weaker than the average.”
