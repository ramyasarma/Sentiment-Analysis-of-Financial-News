             Sales of new U.S. homes rose in June
to the second-lowest level on record, indicating the industry
that sparked the recession is having difficulty sustaining a
recovery following the end of a government tax credit,
economists said before a report today.  
 Purchases  climbed 3.7 percent to a 311,000 annual pace last
month, according to the median estimate of 60 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The rate would be second only to
May’s 300,000 as the lowest since data began in 1963.  
 “The housing market is languishing at very low levels,”
said  Zach Pandl , an economist at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York. “You’re seeing the effects of the tax credit
fade, revealing the underlying weakness in sales.”  
 A lack of jobs is shaking Americans’ confidence in the
recovery, overshadowing a drop in  mortgage rates  that has made
home buying more affordable. Mounting foreclosures are also
swelling the inventory of previously owned houses on the market,
prompting builders to cut back and indicating declines in
construction will restrain the economic recovery.  
 The Commerce Department’s report is due at 10 a.m. in
Washington. Estimates ranged from 290,000 to 360,000.  
 To become eligible for a federal incentive worth up to
$8,000, buyers had to sign contracts by April 30 and close deals
by the end of last month. The surge in demand prior to the April
deadline prompted the government this month to extend the
closing deadline until Sept. 30 to ensure buyers had enough time
to complete transactions.  
 Credit’s Influence  
 Sales of new houses, which are calculated when a contract
is signed, plunged an unprecedented 33 percent in May following
the expiration of the credit after reaching an almost two-year
high the prior month, a Commerce Department’s report showed last
month.  
 Purchases of  previously owned homes , which are tabulated
when a contract closes, fell a less-than-forecast 5.1 percent in
June, sustained by a backlog of deals waiting to settle, figures
from the National Association of Realtors showed last week.  
 Builder shares have dropped this year as the housing
outlook dimmed. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilder
Index , which includes Toll Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., has
fallen 5.4 percent year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index is down
1.1 percent.  
 With the deadline for signing a contract now past, it will
be up to advances in the labor market to support home sales.
Private U.S. companies added 83,000 jobs in June, fewer than
economists had forecast, and initial claims for jobless benefits
this month remain elevated.  
 Mounting Foreclosures  
 Another challenge to new home sales is the rising tide of
foreclosures. Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week,
putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties
this year.  
 NVR Inc. , based in Reston, Virginia, said last week the
original June 30 closing deadline to qualify for the tax
incentive resulted in a “surge in settlement activity” in the
second quarter, with closings jumping 63 percent from the same
time a year earlier. New orders fell 6 percent in the second
quarter to 2,559 units.  
 Homebuilders turned more pessimistic this month, with the
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo confidence
index dropping to the lowest level since April 2009, according
to data released last week.
