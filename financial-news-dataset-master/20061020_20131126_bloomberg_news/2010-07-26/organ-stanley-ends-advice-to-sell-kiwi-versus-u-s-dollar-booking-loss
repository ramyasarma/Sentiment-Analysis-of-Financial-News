             Morgan Stanley analysts ended a
recommendation to sell the New Zealand dollar against the U.S.
currency after the so-called kiwi appreciated beyond the level
set to protect against potential losses.  
 The month-old “tactical trade” was ended on July 23 at
72.73 U.S. cents per New Zealand dollar, a team of strategists
led by  Stephen Hull  in London said today in a note distributed
by e-mail.  
 The trade, based on an opening level of 70.54 cents on June
24, booked a loss, the analysts wrote in the note.  
 The kiwi rose 0.3 percent to 72.98 U.S. cents at 11:31 a.m.
in London.
