             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and
 Daimler AG , the world’s two largest luxury-car manufacturers,
will extend their cooperation on joint development and
purchasing to include car-seat frames to lower costs.  
 The cooperation is part of a joint-purchasing program
between Munich-based BMW and Daimler in Stuttgart, Daimler
spokesman  Florian Martens  said in a telephone interview today.
The carmakers may save 150 million euros ($194 million) to 200
million euros each a year if the seats are used across all
models, BMW spokesman  Frank Wienstroth  said.  
 BMW will reach its goal of cutting spending on components
and supplies by 4 billion euros by 2012, Herbert Diess, the
company’s head of purchasing, said in May. Daimler announced in
April it’s sharing development costs, engines and small-car
technologies with the Renault-Nissan alliance to generate a
total of 4 billion euros in savings and revenue over five years.  
 “We’re constantly looking for joint projects that make
sense,” BMW’s Wienstroth said. He declined to give details on
other components on which the carmakers are cooperating.  
 BMW  fell  23.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 41.76 euros at
11:02 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. Daimler added 19.5 cents, or
0.5 percent, to 42.68 euros.
