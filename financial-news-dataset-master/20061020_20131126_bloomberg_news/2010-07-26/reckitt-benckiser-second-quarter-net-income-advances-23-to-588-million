             Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc , which
last week agreed to buy the maker of Durex condoms, said second-
quarter profit rose 21 percent as it sold more personal-care
goods such as Lysol No Touch soap dispensers.  
 Operating profit climbed to 503 million pounds ($779
million) from 414 million pounds in the year-earlier period, the
Slough, England-based company said today in a statement. That
was more than the 486 million-pound average estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 10 percent to 2.06
billion pounds and the interim dividend was raised to 50 pence.  
 The maker of Nurofen painkillers and Lysol cleaners
announced its plan to buy SSL International Plc for $3.9 billion
as it attempts to overcome the slowdown in sales growth in
Europe, its largest market. Sales there declined 1 percent in
the first half due to “weakness” in fabric care, the company
said.  
 Reckitt reiterated annual targets for 5 percent sales
growth and 10 percent operating profit growth this year,
excluding its pharmaceutical division.  
 “We see little prospect of the full-year targets being
increased given ongoing competitive pressures and share losses
in Western Europe and North America,” Bernstein Research’s
 Andrew Wood  said before the release. He rates the stock a
“market perform.”  
 Reckitt shares gained 43 pence, or 1.3 percent, to 3,336
pence in London trading on July 23. The stock has fallen 0.6
percent this year, compared to Procter & Gamble’s Co.’s 2.1
percent increase.
