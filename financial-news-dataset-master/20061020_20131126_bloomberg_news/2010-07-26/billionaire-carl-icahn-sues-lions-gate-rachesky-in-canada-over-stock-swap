             Carl Icahn  sued  Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp.  in Canada and New York to reverse a debt-
for-equity swap between the Vancouver-based movie studio and
board member  Mark Rachesky .  
 The billionaire investor is seeking an order to prevent
Rachesky from selling the shares or exercising voting rights
attached to them, according to the lawsuit filed July 23 in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia.  
 Icahn, 74, is trying to reverse the swap that hinders his
hostile bid for the studio by putting more shares in the hands
of opponents. The swap boosted Rachesky’s stake, the second-
largest after Icahn’s, to 28.9 percent. Icahn has 33 percent.  
 “I find this scheme reprehensible,” Icahn said in an e-
mailed statement today. “I will spare no expense in holding the
culpable parties responsible for their behavior.”  
 A second lawsuit was filed today in New York State Supreme
Court. Icahn said his $6.50-a-share tender offer will also
continue.  
 “This case involves an unlawful sham transaction by which
an incumbent board of directors, management and their co-
conspirators sought to further entrench their own positions and
to protect their personal interests in compensation and perks at
the sole expense of their company,” according to Icahn’s New
York complaint.  
 Icahn previously offered $7 a share for Lions Gate in a
tender that ended June 30. He has criticized the company’s
spending on films and said in June that he planned a proxy fight
to replace management and the board.  
 Diluted Holding  
 Peter Wilkes , a Lions Gate spokesman, didn’t return a call
seeking comment.  
 Last week, Lions Gate issued new shares to Rachesky’s MHR
Fund Management LLC, putting 12 percent more of the stock in
friendly hands and diluting Icahn’s holding. Rachesky, 51,
increased his stake through a transaction in which one of his
investment funds bought $100 million of convertible notes from
Kornitzer Capital Management, then exchanged debt for stock.  
 Rachesky acquired 16.2 million shares in the exchange at a
price of $6.20 each, Icahn said.  
 The studio, distributor of the “Saw” horror films and
producer of the Emmy-winning “Mad Men” TV series, announced
the Rachesky deal days after a 10-day truce with Icahn expired.  
 During the truce, the two sides discussed potential
acquisitions and possible board seats for Icahn. The talks
didn’t yield results that would merit an extension, Icahn said.  
 Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California,  rose  12
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $6.90 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 19 percent
this year.  
 The case is Icahn v. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.,
651076/2010, Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).
