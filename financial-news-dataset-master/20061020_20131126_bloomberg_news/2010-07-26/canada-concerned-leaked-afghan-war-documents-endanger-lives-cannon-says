             Canada’s foreign affairs minister
said soldiers’ lives may be in more danger because of leaked
U.S. documents about the war in Afghanistan.  
 Lawrence Cannon also said the Canadian government hasn’t
misled the public about the progress of the war, while speaking
to reporters in Ottawa today.  
 The website Wikileaks released about 92,000 classified
documents.
