             FedEx Corp.  boosted its profit
forecast for the quarter and full year, exceeding analysts’
estimates, on rising demand for international express shipments.
The  shares  climbed to a seven-week high.  
 Earnings for the quarter ending in August will be in a
range of $1.05 to $1.25 a share, an increase from the previous
outlook of 85 cents to $1.05, the Memphis, Tennessee-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts projected $1 a
share, the average of 17 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .  
 FedEx said volume for international priority packages,
which are among its most profitable offerings, will jump more
than 20 percent this quarter, adding to signs of a strengthening
global economy. FedEx and  United Parcel Service Inc.  are
considered economic bellwethers because they move goods ranging
from electronics to apparel and financial documents.  
 “Growth in Asia has been red hot, fueled by the tech
sector and iPhones and handheld devices,” said  Mark Vitner , an
economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in Charlotte, North
Carolina. “Air freight is going to benefit greatly from that.”  
 FedEx jumped $4.43, or 5.6 percent, to $83.39 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the highest
closing price since June 3. Atlanta-based UPS gained $1.21, or
1.9 percent, to $64.88.  
 Outlook at UPS  
 UPS increased its full-year forecast last week to as much
as $3.45 a share, from a previous maximum of $3.30, on improving
demand in Asia and Europe. It also said U.S. volumes will keep
growing as industrial production outpaces economic growth in
2010’s second half. UPS is the world’s biggest package-delivery
company, while FedEx has the largest air-cargo fleet.  
 For the year ending in May, FedEx said earnings will be
$4.60 to $5.20 a share, up from a previous outlook of $4.40 to
$5. Full-year earnings were estimated at $4.96, the average of
21 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Our revenue and earnings growth are exceeding original
expectations, primarily due to better-than-anticipated growth in
FedEx Express and FedEx Ground volumes,” Chief Financial
Officer  Alan Graf  said in the statement.  
 The company didn’t give a forecast for growth in domestic
deliveries. Shipments in the U.S. rose 1.3 percent for the
fiscal year that ended in May.  
 ‘Top-Line Growth’  
 “Although domestic shipments have only gradually
recovered, overseas shipments have driven the top-line growth,”
 Craig Hutson , a debt analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, wrote today in
a note to clients.  
 FedEx said it will fully restore its match of employee
contributions to 401(k) retirement accounts because of the
improved outlook. FedEx suspended that benefit during the
recession to lower costs.  
 FedEx has said it plans to buy six more  Boeing Co.  777
freighter jets in the current fiscal year to add capacity on its
longest routes to Asia to take advantage of rising demand. The
planes’ list price would be $1.51 billion before discounts, or
$252 million each, according to Boeing’s website.  
 Quarterly earnings at FedEx a year earlier were $181
million, or 58 cents a share. FedEx’s profit for the year ended
in May was $1.18 billion, or $3.76 a share.
