             China’s recent stocks rally was
driven by speculation about an easing in mortgage policy, lower-
than-expected inflation and the completion of stress tests for
European banks, according to China International Capital Corp.  
 “Extreme oversold” conditions also contributed to the
gains, CICC analysts Hao Hong and Mei He wrote in a report
today. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index advanced 6.1
percent last week for the best performance in seven months.  
 Strong economic growth, lower-than-estimated inflation,
labor shortages and continued gains in property prices make it
“dfficult to convincingly argue for a general monetary
easing,” according to the report.
