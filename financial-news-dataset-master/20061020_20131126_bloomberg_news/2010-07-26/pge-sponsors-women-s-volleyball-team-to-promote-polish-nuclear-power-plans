             A Polish women’s volleyball team
will change its name to Atom after receiving sponsorship from
 Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA , the country’s largest utility,
which plans to build the country’s first nuclear power station.  
 The club will play in the Baltic coast city of Sopot about
60 kilometers (37 miles) from the village of Zarnowiec, the
frontrunner in a competition to host the power plant, the
company known as PGE said on its website today.  
 State-controlled PGE is attempting to build public support
for nuclear power as Poland seeks to reduce pollution from the
coal that supplies 95 percent of its energy without increasing
dependence on Russian gas.  
 PGE has signed agreements to study technologies supplied by
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, EDF and Areva of France and
GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Associates.
