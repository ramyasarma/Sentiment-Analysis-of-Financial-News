             JFE Holdings Inc. ’s steel unit,
Japan’s second-largest producer, agreed to buy a 24 percent
stake in a steel-pipe venture in China to expand in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy.  
 Panchen Yihong Pipe Co., a venture in Chengdu, western
China between PanGang Group Chengdu Steel & Vanadium Co. and
Marubeni-Itochu Steel Inc. will become an affiliate of JFE Steel,
the Tokyo-based company said today in a  statement , without
specifying the value of the deal.  
 JFE Holdings and its domestic rivals, including Nippon
Steel Corp., are expanding in Asia outside their stagnant home
market to tap demand. Panchen Yihong Pipe, which produces
seamless pipes used in oil production, plans to increase its
annual capacity to 330,000 million metric tons from 230,000 tons,
the statement said.  
 PanGang Group Chengdu Steel will own 51 percent and
Marubeni-Itochu Steel will hold 25 percent after JFE joins the
venture, JFE said.  
 JFE Holdings  shares  gained as much as 3.6 percent to 2,794
yen and traded at 2,741 yen, up 1.6 percent, as of 2:45 p.m. in
Tokyo trading.
