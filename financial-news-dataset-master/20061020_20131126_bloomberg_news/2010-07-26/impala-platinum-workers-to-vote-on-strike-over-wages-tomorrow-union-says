             Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. , the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal, faces a strike of
more than 18,000 workers after talks to resolve a pay dispute
failed, South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers said.  
 Members will vote tomorrow on whether to strike after a
second mediation effort by the Commission of Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration on July 24 failed to break a deadlock,
the union’s spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said by phone today. Impala
spokesman  Bob Gilmour  wasn’t available when Bloomberg News
called his office and mobile phones.  
 Workers stopped production at Impala’s Rustenburg
operations, the world’s biggest platinum mine, for about two
weeks last August and September over wages. Impala raised pay by
10 percent to end the strike after it turned violent.  
 Impala is offering workers 8 percent this year while the
NUM is demanding 10 percent in addition to improvements in
transport and housing allowances, the union said in a statement
today. The consumer price inflation rate was 4.6 percent in May.  
 Impala fell 0.6  percent  to 202.20 rand by 11:09 a.m. in
Johannesburg trading.
