             Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd.,
the nation’s largest maker of the metal, rose the most in four
months in Shanghai on speculation China is seeking to curb
industry overcapacity, boosting the company’s profit outlook.  
 Chalco, as the company is known, jumped 6.4 percent to
10.17 yuan at 2:08 p.m. local time.  
 China will limit production of 10 kinds of non-ferrous
metals, including aluminum, to a combined annual output of about
41 million tons by 2015, the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing Shang Fushan, vice chairman of the China
Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.  
 “The overcapacity problem in the aluminum market is the
most serious; when capacity is limited, the market will feel
that there will be less competition,” Owen Liang, analyst at
Guotai Junan Securities Co., said by telephone from Shenzhen.
“Chalco is a leading company in this industry so it will
benefit from the policy.”
