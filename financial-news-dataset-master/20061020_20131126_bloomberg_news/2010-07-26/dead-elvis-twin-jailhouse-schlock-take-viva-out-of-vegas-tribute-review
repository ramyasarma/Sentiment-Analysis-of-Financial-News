             It should be a jackpot: a tribute to
the  King of Rock ‘n’ Roll  in the city that revived his career
and performed by a troupe beloved for its acrobatic, offbeat
shows.  
 Instead, Cirque du Soleil’s “Viva Elvis” at the  Aria
Resort & Casino  in Las Vegas gets smothered in sentimental hooey
and flabbergasting kitsch. In the most jaw-dropping moment,
Elvis Presley bonds with his twin brother, Jesse Garon -- who,
in real life, was stillborn -- as they clamber upon a half moon
to the tune of “One Night With You.”  
 The production, which had its premiere in February at the
recently opened CityCenter megaplex, features a narrator playing
Elvis’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, and highlights milestones
in the singer’s life, including his stint in the Army and
marriage to  Priscilla Presley .  
 Elvis’s late-1950s military service is commemorated with
not one, not two, but three separate numbers. One would think
Elvis was a career officer as opposed to a draftee serving just
two years.  
 The singer’s nuptials are celebrated with a two-story
wedding cake, ballet dancers and roller skaters. While those
elements could lend verve and humor to the number, home movies
of Elvis and  Priscilla  flickering in the background and a female
singer crooning along to an Elvis recording of “Can’t Help
Falling in Love” convey mainly syrupy earnestness.  
 The show gains some energy when it reverts to overt
campiness -- performers in feathered showgirl outfits and Elvis-
slicked hair spill down a staircase to the strains of “Viva Las
Vegas” in one number -- or highlights the acrobatics Cirque is
known for, as in a “Jailhouse Rock” piece that serves as an
homage to the Elvis film of the same name.  
 Acrobatic Superheroes  
 A highlight of the show has superhero-costumed acrobats
bouncing on trampolines and scrambling up walls to the strains
of “Got a Lot of Livin’ to Do.” But the number both overstays
its welcome and seems tenuously connected to the singer and his
life. (Elvis apparently was a comic-book fan, which serves as
the justification for the routine.)  
 Overall, the stage is too often packed with countless
dancers trying to make up in quantity what they lack in
choreography -- an unfortunate throwback to the worst excesses
of  Elvis -era Las Vegas.  
 After the show, there are souvenirs, naturally. Audience
members who didn’t soak up enough of the Elvis aura during the
performance can purchase a foot-high Elvis  Pez candy dispenser 
($28), a three-bottle assortment of Elvis-branded hot sauce
($19.95), or an Elvis-themed metal lunchbox ($18).  
 The show lacks one Vegas perennial: Elvis impersonators.
Instead, it relies on recordings of the King and female-only
live singers because, according to the production’s  website ,
“only Elvis could do justice to Elvis when it came to
portraying his vitality and seductive charm.”  
 Exactly.
