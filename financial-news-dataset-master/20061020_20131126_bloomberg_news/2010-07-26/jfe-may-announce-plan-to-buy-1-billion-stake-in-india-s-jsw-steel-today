             JFE Holdings Inc ., Japan’s second-
largest steelmaker, may announce plans to invest about $1
billion in India’s  JSW Steel Ltd.  as soon as today, said two
people with direct knowledge of the deal.  
 The Tokyo-based company intends to acquire securities
convertible into shares at a minimum price of 1,350 rupees
($28.69) and a maximum of 1,500 rupees each, the people said,
declining to be identified before a public announcement. JFE may
own about 14.9 percent of JSW Steel after the conversion and the
two companies would also sign an agreement on technical
cooperation, the people said.  
 JFE Steel, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JFE Holdings, will
meet the press at 1 p.m. in Tokyo to announce a business
alliance with JSW Steel, according to a notice posted at an
industry press club in the Japanese capital.  
 JFE, which agreed to cooperate with JSW Steel on automobile
steel production in November last year, joins Nippon Steel Corp.
in forging relationships with Indian steelmakers as demand
increases. Sales of passenger cars in India in the first five
months of this year grew 31.6 percent from a year earlier, the
second-fastest in the world after China, according to the
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.  
 JFE  shares  fell 1 percent to 2,715 yen at the 11 a.m.
trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
