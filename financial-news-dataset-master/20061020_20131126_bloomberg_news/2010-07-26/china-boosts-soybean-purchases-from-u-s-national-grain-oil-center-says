             China boosted U.S. soybean purchases
in recent weeks after prices fell against South American
oilseeds and shipping costs declined, a state-owned market
forecaster said.  
 China last week bought 400,000 metric tons of 2010 crop-
year U.S. soybeans, the National Grain & Oils Information Center
said in e-mailed daily report. Since mid-June, crushers also
ordered 600,000 tons of 2009 crop-year beans, and the pace of
the purchases will likely continue, it said.
