             Hero Honda Motors Ltd. , maker of
half the motorcycles sold in India, fell the most in more than a
year in Mumbai after CNBC-TV18 reported  Honda Motor Co.  may sell
a stake of about 6 percent in the company.  
 Hero Honda  slumped  7.5 percent to 1,804.30 rupees, the
biggest drop since May 19 last year. The benchmark  Sensex index 
declined 0.6 percent.  
 Honda may sell part of the New Delhi-based  motorcycle maker 
in which it has 26 percent stake, CNBC-TV18, reported on July 23
without saying where it got the information. A sale may hurt the
 Indian company  as it’s dependent on the Japanese partner for
motorcycle models, said  Vaishali Jajoo , a Mumbai-based Angel
Broking Ltd.  
 “They don’t have their own technology set up in the Indian
market and that’s a major concern,” Jajoo said. “It’s better
the companies come forward and speak to clarify if it is just
speculation,” said Jajoo.  
 Bharatendu Kabi , a Hero Honda spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Yasuko Matsuura , a
spokeswoman for Honda in Tokyo, couldn’t immediately be reached
as it was a company holiday.  
 The New Delhi-based  Hero group  and Honda Motor formed their
joint venture in 1984. Honda set up a separate wholly owned
subsidiary that started selling scooters in 2001 and
subsequently added motorcycles to its range, competing with Hero
Honda.
