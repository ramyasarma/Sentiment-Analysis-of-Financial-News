             Kenya will receive a 12.1 billion-
shilling ($149 million) loan from Japan to build an irrigation
system to boost rice production as it seeks to reduce its
reliance on imports, government officials said.  
 The loan for expanding the Mwea Irrigation System, 100
kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital, Nairobi, will
help Kenya meet its target of irrigating 30,000 hectares (74,000
acres) of farmland annually, David Stower, permanent secretary
in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, told reporters today.  
 The East African nation will also receive a 2.2 billion-
shilling grant from Japan to build a water treatment plant and
distribution pipes in Embu town, about 120 kilometers northeast
of Nairobi, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said at the same
press briefing in the capital.
