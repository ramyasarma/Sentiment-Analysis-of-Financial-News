             China’s demand for liquefied natural
gas may increase 48 percent in 2020 from an earlier forecast as
the cleaner-burning fuel displaces oil, Wood Mackenzie
Consultants Ltd. said.  
 LNG consumption in 2020 may reach 46 million metric tons a
year from a previous estimate of 31 million from end-2009, the
Edinburgh-based energy consultants said in a report titled
“Race for Supply - The Future of China’s Gas Market.”  
 “This strong demand growth will not purely be driven by
gross domestic product,”  Gavin Thompson , China gas study
director for Wood Mackenzie, said in an e-mailed statement today.
“The gas demand story is about displacing oil products, not
coal, in the industrial and residential sectors.”  
 China’s economy expanded 10.3 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, down from 11.9 percent the previous three
months, after the government tempered credit expansion,
investment spending and property speculation. The full-year
expansion will be 10 percent, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists on July 15.  
 The nation’s gas demand may rise to 43 billion cubic feet a
day (444 billion cubic meters) in 2030 from 9 billion cubic feet
a day last year, with strongest growth prior to 2020, according
to excerpts from the Wood Mackenzie report.  
 “This will expand the opportunity for LNG suppliers
seeking to secure markets, particularly those in Australasia,”
Thompson said.  
 Additional LNG  
 The world’s biggest energy user may boost LNG purchases by
about 65 percent this year from imports of 5.5 million tons in
2009, according to Facts Global Energy in a July 22 report.
Imports in June rose by 58 percent from a year earlier to
741,732 tons, according to customs data from China. Purchases of
the fuel reached a record 842,697 tons in April.  
 Production of unconventional gas, lodged in rocks and
coalfields, may exceed 11 billion cubic feet a day in China by
2030, accounting for more than a quarter of total gas supply,
Thompson said.  
 Gas deposits found in unconventional and hard-to-extract
sources may account for as much as 75 percent of China’s total
reserves of 3,687 trillion cubic feet based on 2020 demand,
adequate to supply the world’s second-largest energy user for a
century, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said in November. The
country currently has 80 trillion cubic feet of proven
conventional gas reserves, representing 10 years of total supply,
it said.  
 Shale Expands  
 “Shale gas is the major growth story in China gas,” Wood
Mackenzie’s Thomson said. “However, unconventional gas
resources will take a significant time to develop and therefore
meeting its gas demand will require China to import significant
additional volumes of LNG and piped gas, particularly up to
2020.”  
 Chevron Corp., BG Group Plc, Santos Ltd., Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. and Inpex Corp. are among companies developing
LNG projects in Australia, both from conventional offshore
fields and from coal-seam gas. Chevron said on its website that
the proposed Wheatstone venture in Western Australia may produce
25 million tons of LNG a year, almost sufficient to supply South
Korea, the world’s biggest LNG user after Japan.  
 Roger Martin , a spokesman for Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
which is planning the Pluto LNG project in Western Australia,
declined in an e-mail to comment. Representatives of Chevron,
Santos, and BG didn’t immediately respond to calls or e-mails.
