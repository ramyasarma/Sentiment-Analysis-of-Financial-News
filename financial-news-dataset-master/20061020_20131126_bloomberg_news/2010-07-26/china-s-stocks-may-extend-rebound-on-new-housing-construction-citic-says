             China’s stocks may extend a rebound
as the government accelerates construction of low-income housing
and infrastructure projects to make up for a slowdown in
investment, according to Citic Securities Co.  
 The slowdown in economic growth has caught the attention of
the government, which will put “maintaining growth” as the
foundation for “adjusting structures,” wrote analysts led by
Yu Jun in a report today.  
 The brokerage recommended financial companies and companies
with low valuations, such as Poly Real Estate Group Co. and
Industrial Bank Co.
