             Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich
may finance the New Holland property development in St.
Petersburg’s historic city center, Kommersant reported, with
citing anyone.  
 The project, designed by British architect Norman Foster,
was abandoned by former billionaire Chalva Tchigirinski after
Russia’s record stock market rout in 2008, the Moscow-based
newspaper said.
