             Klepierre SA , Europe’s second-
largest shopping center owner, said earnings declined 7.8
percent in the first half on smaller tax credits and less profit
from asset sales.  
 Net income fell to 63.5 million euros ($83 million), or 30
cents a share, from 68.9 million euros, or 40 cents, a year
earlier, the Paris-based company said on its  Web site  after the
market closed.  Net asset value  rose 1.2 percent from six months
earlier to 27.8 euros a share.  
 The company booked a 108.5 million-euro profit from the
sale of Paris offices and other real estate in the first half,
20 percent less than a year earlier, while tax credits fell by
32 million euros. Rental income for buildings owned through the
first half dropped 0.7 percent as weak consumer spending and
higher unemployment in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Portugal and
Spain led Klepierre to offer incentives to secure or retain
tenants.  
 Net cash flow  fell 1.7 percent from a year earlier to 99
cents a share. The company reiterated a forecast for a
“slight” decline in cash flow per share this year, reflecting
prospects for sluggish retail sales and rental growth in Hungary
and Portugal.  
 Klepierre  shares lost 6.7 percent in the six months through
July 23 on concern the outlook for consumer spending across
Europe is deteriorating. The FTSE EPRA- Nareit European Index  of
real estate stocks advanced 1.8 percent in the same period.  
 Klepierre rose 0.6 percent in Paris trading today to 25.85
euros, giving the company a market value of 4.9 billion euros.  
 Rental Income  
 Net rental income climbed 4.3 percent to 414.4 million
euros as Klepierre enlarged two centers in Sweden and benefited
from extensions to or acquisitions of five French centers.  
 Net debt  totaled 7.36 billion euros, or 48.6 percent of the
value of the company’s real estate, at the end of June, down
from 49.4 percent six months earlier. Amortization charges and
related writedowns trimmed earnings by 189 million euros.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Laurent Morel  plans to sell as much
as 400 million euros in assets this year and use the proceeds to
pay down debt.  
 Unlike other European real estate investment trusts,
Klepierre doesn’t include valuation changes to its properties in
its income accounts. It books a profit or loss only after
selling a building.  
 Development Projects  
 In April, Klepierre raised 900 million euros from the sale
of bonds, giving it 1.2 billion euros in unused credit for
financing development projects. The company has a dozen projects
to open new centers or extend existing ones by the end of 2012,
which it expects will generate 75 million euros of additional
rental income.  
 Larger competitor Unibail-Rodamco SE last week reported
first-half net income of 1.11 billion euros, compared with a
loss of 1.32 billion euros a year earlier. The company’s net
asset value rose 2.2 percent from the end of last year to 131
euros a share.
