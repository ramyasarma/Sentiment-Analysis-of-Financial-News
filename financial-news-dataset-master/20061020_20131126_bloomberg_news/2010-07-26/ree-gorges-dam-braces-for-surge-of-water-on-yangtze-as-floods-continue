             The Three Gorges Dam, the world’s
largest, is preparing today to hold back a new rush of flood
waters on China’s Yangtze River after Premier Wen Jiabao ordered
government officials to be ready for more disasters.  
 Water at the Three Gorges may flow at 56,000 cubic meters per
second on July 28, the fastest rate since the July 20 record speed
of 70,000 cubic meters per second, the operator said. The dam
released water today, lowering its reservoir’s water level to
156.79 meters as of 1 p.m. local time to gird for the expected
rush of water, China Three Gorges Corp. said in a statement.  
 Torrential rains may hit 11 Chinese province today and
tomorrow, as the death toll from the nation’s worst flooding in
more than a decade continued to rise. Wen ordered officials on
July 24 to prepare for “more serious flooding and disasters” as
742 people were reported dead as of July 23, Xinhua News Agency
said.  
 At least 111 people have been killed in Shaanxi province in
the northwest, due to flooding in the past 11 days, Xinhua
 reported . Another 167 people were missing while more than 100,000
others were forced to evacuate, Xinhua said, citing the provincial
government.  
 Floods also disputed trains traveling to western China’s
Tibet, delaying some journeys to the capital city of Lhasa from
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou by almost 20 hours yesterday,
 Xinhua  reported.  
 Parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, Tibet, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian,
Guangdong, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning may see
torrential rains today and tomorrow, the  National Meteorological
Center  forecasted on its website today.  
 Flood Risks  
 Liu Ning , Vice Minister of Water Resources, called on local
authorities to “closely monitor” the weather and to “step up”
monitoring of potential flood risks, the China Daily newspaper
cited him as saying yesterday.  
 Flooding in China has left 367 people missing this year and
affected 120 million others as of July 23, Xinhua reported. About
670,000 homes have been destroyed and 7.6 million hectares of
crops damaged, with total losses estimated at 152.4 billion yuan
($22.5 billion), according to Xinhua.  
 In addition to rain, the National Meteorological Center also
issued high-temperature  warnings  today for the municipalities of
Chongqing, Beijing and Tianjin, as well as for the provinces of
Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hebei, Shanxi and
Shaanxi. Temperatures in these regions were forecast to reach as
high as 38 degree Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit), center said.  
 The provinces of Inner Mongolia, Gansu and  Xinjiang  were
