             Huaneng Power International Inc.
plans to sell up to 1.5 billion A-shares at a minimum of 5.57
yuan ($0.82) each, the company told Shanghai’s stock exchange.  
 The company will raise up to 8.6 billion yuan selling the
yuan-denominated stock, according to yesterday’s  statement .  
 The announcement contrasts with Huaneng saying in January
that it aimed to sell shares for a minimum of 7.13 yuan each.
The plan has been revised because of changes in the market
environment, the company said yesterday.  
 Huaneng will also sell H-shares, with the amount depending
on the size of the A-share sale. Approvals from independent
shareholders will be sought at a Sept. 10 meeting.
