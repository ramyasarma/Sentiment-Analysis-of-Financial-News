             A lower percentage of hopefuls for
the Chartered Financial Analyst designation passed the first and
second level of their three-part exam in June compared with a
year earlier, as a record number of people tried to get an edge
in Wall Street hiring.  
 Forty-two percent of applicants passed the exam’s first
test, CFA Institute spokeswoman Kathy King said today, down from
46 percent on the June 2009 exam. Thirty-nine percent of
applicants passed the second, compared with 41 percent a year
earlier.  
 A record 139,900 candidates enrolled to take CFA exams in
June, aiming to capitalize as Wall Street begins to recover from
the worst shakeout in decades. Applicants take the test hoping
the certification can lead to better jobs, higher salaries and a
deeper understanding of finance.  
 Financial firms are adding workers for the first time in
two years, rebuilding businesses after cutting more than 346,000
jobs since the credit crisis began in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In New York, 6,900 financial-industry
positions were added from the end of February through June,
according to the New York State Department of Labor.  
 Candidates can take the Level 1 exam in both June and
December, unlike the two latter levels, which are available once
a year. Thirty-four percent of candidates passed the Level 1
exam in December 2009. Level 3 results are available in August.

 The latest round of exams  drew applicants  from 160
countries, including 38,200 people from the U.S., 15,700 from
China and 11,800 from India, the institute said June 2. The
Level 1 exam, which attracted 62,300 candidates, focuses on
investment tools and the foundations of business. 52,500
hopefuls applied for the Level 2 exam, which focuses on a
variety of asset classes.  
 Successful charter recipients spend an average of  300 hours 
preparing for each exam and typically take four years to
complete all three tests, according to the not-for-profit
institute. Candidates must have at least four years professional
experience in the investment industry to receive the
designation.  
 The institute formed in 1990 with the merger of the
Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and the Financial
Analysis Federation. The CFA program, previously administered by
the ICFA, started in 1963 with 284 applicants. It stems in part
from  Benjamin Graham , a pioneer of value investing who mentored
 Warren Buffett  and advocated a rating system for financial
analysts.
