             Singapore Airlines Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest carrier by market value, posted a better-than-
estimated quarterly profit as a rebound in air-travel demand
helped it to fill more seats.  
 Net income  totaled S$252.5 million ($185 million) compared
with a loss of S$307.1 million a year earlier, the carrier said
in a statement today. That beat the S$162.4 million average of
four  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter
sales increased 21 percent to S$3.5 billion.  
 Singapore Air boosted  passenger numbers 5.5 percent  in the
quarter as travel rebounded from the worst recession in more
than six decades.  United Airlines  parent UAL Corp., which plans
to merge with Continental Airlines Inc. to form the world’s
largest carrier, also posted a net income as the airline
industry heads for its first worldwide profit in three years.  
 “Business is coming back and the worst is finally over for
Singapore Airlines,” said  Jay Ryu , a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Mirae Asset Securities Co. “Passenger yields are also starting
to improve along with the general global economic recovery.”  
 Profit was also bolstered by a smaller fuel-hedging loss of
S$78 million, compared with S$287 million a year earlier,
 Singapore Air  said in the statement.  
 Passenger Numbers  
 The airline flew 4 million passengers in the period,
compared with 3.8 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. It filled 78.4 percent of seats in the quarter,
compared with 71.6 percent a year earlier.  
 “Advance bookings indicate that the year-on-year recovery
in passenger carriage and yields evident in the quarter to June
will hold up for the rest of 2010,” the airline said. “Recent
resurgence in air freight may be sustained in the near term,
although the rate of growth may abate.”  
 Passenger yield, or the average price a traveler pays to
fly one kilometer, rose to 11.7 Singapore cents in the three
months, compared with 10.2 cents a year earlier. The airline
filled 65 percent of its cargo space, compared with 60.6 percent
a year earlier.  
 Singapore Air  fell 0.1 percent to S$14.76 at the close of
trading today. The results were released after the market closed.
Of the 22  analysts  covering the carrier tracked by Bloomberg
data in the past 12 months, 18 have a “buy” rating, three
recommended that investors hold the stock, while one says
“sell.”  
 More Flights  
 The airline last week announced plans to add more flights
to cities including Los Angeles, Sydney and Moscow on rising
demand.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. , Hong Kong’s largest, is
also flying fuller planes, while Korean Air Lines Co., the
nation’s biggest, has said it may beat its full-year  sales  goal.  
 Prospects at airlines are improving following the worst
traffic slowdown since World War II last year. Carriers in Asia-
Pacific will likely post the biggest profit of any region this
year, according to estimates by the  International Air Transport
Association .  
 Spending on  jet fuel , Singapore Air’s biggest expenditure,
increased 10 percent to S$1.13 billion in the quarter. Jet-
kerosene prices in Singapore averaged at $89.71 a barrel in the
quarter, compared with $66.68 a barrel a year earlier.  
 The carrier took delivery of four Airbus SAS A330-300s in
the quarter while decommissioning six Boeing Co. 777 aircraft.
It had  106 passenger aircraft  on its fleet as of June 30.
