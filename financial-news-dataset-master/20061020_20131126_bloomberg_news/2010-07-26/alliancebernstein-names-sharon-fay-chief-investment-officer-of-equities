             AllianceBernstein LP  named  Sharon Fay , a 20-year company veteran, chief investment officer of
equities.  
 Lisa Shalett , head of growth equities, will leave the New
York-based firm, AllianceBernstein said in a statement today.
Fay has been head of value stocks since 2009.  
 “Sharon is an experienced investor with a proven track
record of delivering superior investment results for our
clients,”  Peter Kraus , the company’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  
 AllianceBernstein, which managed $458 billion as of June
30, is majority-owned by French insurer Axa SA. A minority stake
is owned by the publicly listed AllianceBernstein Holding LP,
which declined 4.8 percent this year through July 23, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.
