             Portugal Telecom SGPS SA investor
Banco Espirito Santo SA said the telecommunications company
should invest in Brazil if it sells its stake in a venture that
controls Brazilian wireless operator Vivo Participacoes SA.  
 The operator known as Oi may have “great potential,” and
there are also other Brazilian companies that are
“interesting,” Banco Espirito Santo Chief Executive Officer
Ricardo Salgado told reporters in Lisbon today.  
 Spanish newspaper El Economista reported today that
Portugal Telecom aims to own a stake of between 30 percent and
40 percent in Brazil’s Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA, known
as Oi.  
 Telefonica SA of Spain earlier this month ended a 7.15
billion-euro bid for the stake in the Brasilcel venture that
controls Vivo, turning down a request from Portugal Telecom to
extend the offer beyond July 16. The Portuguese government had
blocked the offer at an investor meeting on June 30.  
 Espirito Santo’s Salgado also said today that he would
support the re-election of Portugal Telecom’s board.
