             Archaeologists have uncovered for
the first time in Israel fragments of a law code that resemble
portions of the famous Code of Hammurabi.  
 The code was found on two fragments of a clay tablet, and
is between 3,700 and 3,800 years old, the  Hebrew University of
Jerusalem  said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 The fragments “refer to issues of personal injury law
relating to slaves and masters, bringing to mind similar laws
in the famous Babylonian Hammurabi Code of the 18th century
B.C. that were found in what is now Iran over 100 years ago,”
the statement said. “The laws also reflect, to a certain
extent, biblical laws of the type ‘a tooth for a tooth’.”  
 The discovery opens an interesting avenue for
investigation of a connection between Biblical law and the Code
of Hammurabi, according to Wayne Horowitz of the Hebrew
University Institute of Archaeology, who is preparing the law
code fragments for publication. The style of the text is
similar to that of the Hammurabi Code, he said.  
 The tablet, written in Akkadian cuneiform script, was
discovered in Hazor, in the north of Israel. Words that have
been deciphered include “master,” “slave” and a word
referring to bodily parts, apparently the word for “tooth.”  
 The two fragments are the 18th and 19th cuneiform finds
from the Hazor excavations, which now form the largest body of
documents of cuneiform texts found in Israel. Previous
documents found dealt with subjects including the dispatch of
people or goods, a legal dispute, and a text of multiplication
tables.  
 The Hazor excavations are under the direction of Amnon
Ben-Tor and Sharon Zuckerman of the Hebrew University. Previous
excavations were directed at the site by Yigael Yadin in the
1950s and 1960s.
