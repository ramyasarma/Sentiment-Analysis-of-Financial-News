             Equity and debt markets will rate
European banks using harsher stress scenarios than the Committee
of European Banking Supervisors, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 “Funding, equity and debt markets will tier banks based on
banks’ perceived solvency position under a market-realistic
stress scenario,” analysts at Citigroup led by  Stefan Nedialkov 
wrote in a report dated July 23. The test could be “harsher
than the CEBS test and include stressing the banking book,” it
said.  
 European Union stress tests found that seven banks need to
raise 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital. Germany’s
 Hypo Real Estate Holding AG ,  Agricultural Bank of Greece SA  and
five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate reserves to
maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23.
