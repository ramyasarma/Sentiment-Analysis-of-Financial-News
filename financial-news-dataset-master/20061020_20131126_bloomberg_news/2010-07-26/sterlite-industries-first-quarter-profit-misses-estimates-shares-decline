             Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. ,
owner of the nation’s biggest zinc producer, reported first-
quarter profit rose 50 percent after a gain in metal prices.  
 Net income climbed to 10.1 billion rupees ($215 million),
or 2.83 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30 from
6.72 billion rupees, or 2.37 rupees, a year earlier, according
to a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The average
estimate of 22 analysts complied by Bloomberg was 11.8 billion
rupees. Sales rose 29 percent to 59.2 billion rupees.  
 Sterlite , part of London-based Vedanta Resources Plc, owns
 Hindustan Zinc Ltd. , which reported a 24 percent gain in first-
quarter profit on July 24. Prices of zinc, used to rust-proof
steel, averaged 37 percent higher in the quarter in London,
rebounding from a year-earlier slump caused by the global
recession.  
 “Metal prices -- copper, aluminum, zinc -- all were up,”
said  Paresh Jain , an analyst at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.
Still, “the results are on the lower end of expectations,” he
said.  
 Sterlite, also India’s largest copper producer, benefited
from prices that averaged 50 percent higher in London during the
quarter.  
 Sterlite fell 0.1 percent to 173.85 rupees at the close of
trade in Mumbai. The stock has fallen 19.5 percent this year,
compared with a 3.2 percent advance in India’s benchmark
Sensitive Index, or Sensex.  
 Hindustan Zinc reported net income rose to 8.91 billion
rupees, or 21.09 rupees a share, in the three months ended June
30 from 7.19 billion rupees, or 17.01 rupees, a year ago.
