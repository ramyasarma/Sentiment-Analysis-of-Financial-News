             EnergySolutions Inc., the nuclear-
services company, is marketing debt as spreads on high-yield,
high-risk debt reach their tightest in two months.  
 EnergySolutions  may sell senior notes, the company said
July 13 in a statement distributed by Marketwire. Moody’s
Investors Service rated the proposed senior unsecured notes B3,
according to a report published July 19. The extra yield
investors demand to own speculative-grade debt instead of
Treasuries fell to 659 basis points on July 23, the lowest since
May 19, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High
Yield Master II.  
 The junk-rated sale comes as high-yield volume reached $5.2
billion last week, a 57 percent increase over the prior week.
 Christopher Garman , president of Orinda, California-based Garman
Research LLC, attributed the surge in junk volume to a “pick-
up” in secondary demand that drew issuers to market.  
 “The bid for high-yield has been very solid,” Garman
said. “The high-yield bond market is a lower-risk alternative
for investors worried about top-line growth in a sluggish
economic atmosphere.”  
 Junk debt spreads narrowed 18 basis points last week, the
index data show. Absolute yields on speculative grade debt fell
14 basis points to 8.65 percent on July 23.  
 High-yield bonds have returned 2.7 percent this month
including reinvested interest, outperforming investment-grade
debt which returned 1 percent. Junk bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB by S&P. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 ‘Rocky and Volatile’  
 Total corporate bond sales reached $23 billion last week,
bringing July’s total issuance to $67.6 billion, a 25.4 percent
increase over the similar period in June. Garman expects volume
will maintain its recent level ahead of September and October,
which he says can be “rocky and volatile months.”  
 Investment-grade yields dropped 1 basis point to 4.16
percent last week, after touching 4.11 percent, the lowest since
March 2004, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Corporate Master index. Investment-grade spreads narrowed 5
basis points to 193 basis points, the index data show.  
 Standard & Poor’s assigned a BB- rating to Salt Lake City-
based EnergySolutions’s notes, which mature in 2018, citing the
“aggressive financial risk profile” and operational risks in
A July 15 report.  James T Siahaan , the primary credit analyst on
the report, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  
 ‘Modestly, Yet Steadily’  
 Moody’s analysts  Paul Aran  and  Michael J. Mulvaney , both
based in New York who wrote their company’s credit opinion, gave
the rating a stable outlook on “weakened pro-forma credit
metrics and the expectation that leverage and other credit
metrics will improve modestly, yet steadily over the
intermediate term.”  
 “Essentially, they’re changing their capital structure
around” to include some bond debt, Aran said in an interview.
“They seem to be an important player in the market so
we’re not expecting them to lose any market share over the
intermediate term.”  
 Following is a description of at least $3.52 billion of
pending sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S.
