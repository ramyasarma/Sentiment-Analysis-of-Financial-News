             Sohu.com Inc. , operator of China’s
fourth most-visited Web portal, posted second-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates, after the company increased
online advertising sales.  
 Net income was $33.45 million, or 82 cents a share, little
changed from $33.53 million, or 79 cents, a year earlier, Sohu
said in a statement today. The Beijing-based company was
expected to post profit of $32.2 million, based on the average
of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sohu last year spun off online games unit  Changyou.com Ltd. 
to focus on selling advertising to companies in the world’s
biggest Internet market by users. Chairman  Charles Zhang  is
boosting spending to develop Sohu’s search engine, Sogou, after
 Google Inc.  moved its Chinese service offshore amid a standoff
with local regulators on Web censorship.  
 Sales increased 15 percent to $146.1 million, Sohu said.
Revenue from Internet advertising rose 26 percent to $57.1
million, while online game sales gained 17 percent to $77.7
million.  
 Third-quarter revenue will range from $153 million to $158
million, Sohu said. The company is expected to post sales of
$155.2 million for the period, the average of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sohu  shares  rose 2.4 percent to $45.04 on the NASDAQ stock
market on July 23. The stock has declined 21 percent this year,
compared with a 7.5 percent drop in shares of rival Chinese
portal  Sina Corp.   
 Sogou accounted for 1.1 percent of China’s paid-search
market last year, making it the country’s third-biggest behind
 Baidu Inc.  and Google, according to research company iResearch.  
 Sohu is China’s fourth most-visited portal behind Baidu,
Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Sina, according to  China Websites
Ranking , a site run by the Internet Society of China that
compiles Web traffic information.
