             American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer bailed out by the U.S., gained the most in about two
weeks after data showed that sales of new homes in the U.S. rose
more than forecast last month.  
 The insurer jumped $1.93, or 5.3 percent, to $38.70 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , after
climbing as much as 7.4 percent. The company has advanced 29
percent this year, while the S&P is little changed.  
 AIG, once the world’s largest insurer, has  units  that
initiate, insure and invest in home loans. Purchases of new
homes increased 24 percent from May to an annual pace of
330,000, the Commerce Department in Washington said today.  
 “The housing market is very important to AIG’s health,”
said  Bill Bergman , an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
“You’ve got to give them credit when it improves.”
