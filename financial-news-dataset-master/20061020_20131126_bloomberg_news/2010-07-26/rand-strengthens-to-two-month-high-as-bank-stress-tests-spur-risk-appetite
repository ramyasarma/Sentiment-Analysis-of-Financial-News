             South Africa’s rand rallied to its
strongest level in almost two months against the dollar after
most European banks passed stress tests, boosting confidence in
the global economic outlook and investor appetite for risk.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 7.3784 per
dollar, its strongest intraday price since May 4, before trading
0.4 percent higher at 7.4061 as of 10:42 a.m. in Johannesburg,
from a close of 7.4345 on July 23. Against the euro, the rand
gained 0.4 percent to 9.5567.  
 European regulators found that seven of the 91 banks
subject to evaluations need to raise a combined 3.5 billion
euros ($4.5 billion) of capital, lenders and regulators said
after the close of European trading on July 23. Before the
results were published, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated that
lenders would need to raise 38 billion euros and Barclays
Capital said they would require as much as 85 billion euros.  
 “The stress tests were better than expected and while the
news is still being digested, there has been a shift in
sentiment with relief,” said  Brigid Taylor , a senior currency
trader at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg. “This bodes well
for riskier currencies such as the rand.” Taylor sees the rand
trading between 7.36 and 7.45 against the dollar today, and
between 7.32 and 7.48 during the week.  
 Advances in gold and platinum prices also boosted the rand.
The metals account for about a fifth of South Africa’s export
earnings.  
 Money-market futures dropped for the first time in three
days as investors increased bets the central bank will cut rates
when it announces its decision on Sept. 9. Forward-rate
agreements showed that contracts for three-month cash due in
three months fell 0.5 basis point to 6.32 percent.  
 Government bonds rose, with the price of the 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 gaining 44 cents to 124.27 rand,
lowering the yield by 9 basis points to 7.67 percent.
