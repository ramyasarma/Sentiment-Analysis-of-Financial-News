             Alcoa Inc ., the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, plan to sell $1 billion of notes as soon as
today in its biggest offering in two years, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  
 The 10-year notes may yield about 318 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person, who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t set. Proceeds will be used
with cash on hand to repay outstanding debt, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing that didn’t include
the size or timing of the sale.  
 Alcoa is marketing bonds less than two weeks after it
reported second-quarter sales and profit that beat analysts’
estimates and forecast higher global demand for the metal. The
aluminum producer is conducting the sale in conjunction with a
tender offer for outstanding debt, according to a statement
distributed by Business Wire.  
 “As the tender offer is to be funded with a new bond
issue, and Alcoa is paying a premium on the tendered bonds, the
result of these actions won’t diminish the company’s net debt
load,”  Carol Levenson , director of research at Gimme Credit LLC
said in a note today. “The maturity extension will be a slight
credit positive.”  
 Alcoa plans to purchase its outstanding 6.5 percent notes
due in June 2011, 6 percent notes maturing in January 2012 and
5.375 percent bonds due in January 2013, it said in the filing.
Alcoa has $583.5 million outstanding of the 6.5 percent debt,
$516.7 million of the 6 percent notes and $600 million of the
5.375 percent notes, according to the filing.  
 Previous Sales  
 The aluminum producer sold $1.5 billion of notes in a two-
part offering in July 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its last debt offering was in March 2009, when Alcoa
sold $575 million of convertible notes, Bloomberg data show.  
 The company had $1.34 billion of cash at the end of the
second quarter, Alcoa Chief Financial Officer  Charles McLane 
said in a conference call last month.  
 The notes due in 2020 may be rated Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, the person
familiar with the sale said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche
Bank AG are managing the offering for the company, according to
today’s filing.
