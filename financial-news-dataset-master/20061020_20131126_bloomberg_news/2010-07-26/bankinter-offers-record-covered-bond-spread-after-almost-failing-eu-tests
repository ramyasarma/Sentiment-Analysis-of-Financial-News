             Bankinter SA , the Spanish lender
that almost failed the European Union bank stress tests, offered
a record-high spread to sell covered bonds.  
 The lender added 400 million euros ($518 million) to its
2.625 percent mortgage-backed bonds due April 2013 at a spread
of 240 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of
195 basis points paid by  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA  to
sell 2 billion euros of three-year covered bonds on July 19,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The EU revealed that in stressed economic conditions
Madrid-based Bankinter would have a so-called Tier 1 capital
ratio of 6.8 percent, just above the 6 percent pass mark. The
lender’s Finance Director  David Perez Renovales  told Bloomberg
Television today that the bank has sufficient capital.  
 “Investors are still extremely negative on Spanish
lenders,” said  Florian Hillenbrand,  a Munich-based analyst at
UniCredit. “The spread offered implies that investors are not
giving any worth to the pool of mortgages backing the deal.”  
 A spokesman for Bankinter, who declined to be identified,
said “it is very far from our opinion” that the lender almost
failed the stress tests, and that the result was satisfactory.
Barclays Capital and Natixis are helping to manage the sale.  
 The issue that Bankinter tapped was for 1 billion euros of
three-year covered notes priced at a spread of 85 basis points
more than the swap rate on March 25, Bloomberg data show.
Covered bonds use mortgages or public-sector loans to guarantee
payments and can help lenders reduce borrowing costs.  
 Bankinter rose 0.16 percent to 5.58 euros at 4:20 p.m. in
Madrid.
