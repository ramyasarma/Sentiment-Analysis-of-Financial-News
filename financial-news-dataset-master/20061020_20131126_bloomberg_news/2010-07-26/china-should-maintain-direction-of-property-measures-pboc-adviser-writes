             China should maintain the direction
of its property measures, central bank adviser Xia Bin wrote in
a commentary published in today’s China Business News newspaper.  
 Property measures should not be implemented too quickly as
China’s economic growth may slow in the second half, Xia wrote.
Real estate should be treated as a consumer good and not a
financial good, Xia wrote.
