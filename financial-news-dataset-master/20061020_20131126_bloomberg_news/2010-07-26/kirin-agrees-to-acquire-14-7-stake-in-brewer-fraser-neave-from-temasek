             Kirin Holdings Co. , Japan’s largest
brewer, agreed to pay S$1.34 billion ($984 million) for Temasek
Holdings Pte’s 14.7 percent holding in  Fraser & Neave Ltd.  to
boost overseas growth.  
 Kirin will buy 205.5 million shares for S$6.50 each from
Singapore’s state-investment company, the Tokyo-based beermaker
said in a  statement  on its website yesterday. That’s 14.6
percent higher than yesterday’s closing price for the Singapore-
based property developer that also makes Tiger beer while
bottling and marketing  Coca-Cola Co.  products such as Sprite.  
 The deal adds to more than $7 billion of overseas purchases
in the past three years by  Kirin , which is seeking to strengthen
its business in Southeast Asia, where it said it has been
“weak.”  Kirin  will gain a stake in Singapore’s biggest soft-
drink maker by market share, while  Temasek  is selling the  Fraser
& Neave  shares for 48 percent more than it paid in 2006.  
 “Southeast Asia has been a weak spot for  Kirin ,”
 Yoshiyasu Okihira , a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG., said yesterday. “Fraser & Neave can sell National Foods’
products, so it would also help spur sales for the Australian
unit.”  
 Kirin bought National Foods, Australia’s biggest producer
of milk and juice, for A$2.8 billion ($2.5 billion) in 2007.
Consumer spending has stagnated in Japan as its  population  ages.
Buying a stake in Fraser & Neave will be the first capital
partnership for Kirin since it ended talks to merge with Suntory
Holdings Ltd. in February.  
 Share Performance  
 Kirin  fell 0.4 percent to close at 1,148 yen in Tokyo and
 is down  23 percent this year.  Fraser & Neave  rose 1.2 percent to
S$5.74 in Singapore trading, extending its  gain this year  to 37
percent.  
 Kirin  will become the second-biggest shareholder in  Fraser &
Neave  once the deal is completed, according to the Singaporean
company and data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “With this deal, we have built a base for Southeast Asia,
where our soft-drink business has been weak,”  Hirotake Kobayashi , managing director at  Kirin , said at a press
conference in Tokyo. “The portion is small, but strategically
it’s very meaningful.”  
 Kirin will meet Fraser & Neave’s management to discuss how
the two companies can cooperate, he said.  Fraser & Neave  had the
biggest market share of soft-drinks makers in Singapore last
year with 21.2 percent, according to Euromonitor International.
It’s also biggest in the bottled-water market, with a 40.9
percent share.  
 Market Share  
 Coca-Cola  ranked second in Singapore’s soft-drink market
with 19.5 percent while Kirin was 19th with 0.3 percent,
according to Euromonitor.  
 Fraser & Neave ’s brewery, dairy and soft-drink businesses
contributed about 54 percent of its S$5.3 billion sales in the
financial year that ended in September. Property development, a
business it entered in 1990, contributed 28 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Singapore-based company, which  began  in 1883 as the
Singapore and Straits Aerated Water Company, also makes F&N
Magnolia dairy products, 100 Plus sports drinks and is a partner
of  Heineken NV . Net income before exceptional items and value
adjustments surged 89 percent to S$170.3 million in the three
months ended March.  
 Temasek’s asset sales  in the year that ended in March,
including the sale of its 62 percent stake in Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., fell to S$6 billion from S$16
billion the previous year, according to its latest annual
report.  
 Temasek Investment  
 Temasek  was founded to help develop Singapore’s banks,
airlines and ports.  
 It bought a 14.9 percent stake in Fraser & Neave for S$900
million in 2006 to “support its ambitions,”  David Heng ,
Temasek’s managing director for investments, said in a
statement. When Temasek was approached by Kirin more than a week
ago, it decided Fraser & Neave had a “good opportunity to work
with an established” food and beverage company, Heng said.  
 The transaction may be completed by July 29 and it will be
funded by existing cash and borrowings, Kirin said.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch  was the financial adviser to
Kirin on the transaction.
