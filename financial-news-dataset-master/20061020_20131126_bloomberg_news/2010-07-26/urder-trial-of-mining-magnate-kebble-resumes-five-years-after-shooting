             The trial of  Glenn Agliotti  for
conspiracy to murder South African mining magnate  Brett Kebble 
will start in Johannesburg today, a spokeswoman for the National
Prosecuting Authority said.  
 “There’s nothing that should delay it today,” Charlene
Labuschagne said today in a phone interview from Johannesburg.
“The prosecution will make its opening address. Maybe we’ll
hear some witnesses too, but we don’t know yet.”  
 Agliotti, who was a friend of Kebble, has said the death
five years ago was an “assisted suicide.” The 41-year-old died
in his car in northern Johannesburg in September 2005 after
being shot seven times.  
 The trial was delayed because Agliotti, a convicted drug
dealer, served as a witness in the trial of former South African
police chief  Jackie Selebi , who was found guilty of corruption
on July 2.  
 Kebble worked in South Africa’s gold industry for 11 years,
helping to create  Harmony Gold Mining Co.  and  DRDGold Ltd. , two
of the country’s four biggest gold miners. A month before his
death he quit as chief executive officer of Randgold &
Exploration Ltd., JCI Ltd. and Western Areas Ltd. at the request
of creditors.
