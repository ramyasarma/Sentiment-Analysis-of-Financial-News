             Russian stocks rose to their highest
level in more than a month as OAO Rosneft’s earnings beat
estimates, the government proposed selling stakes in companies
and stress tests in Europe bolstered investor confidence.  
 Rosneft  rallied 3.4 percent after the country’s biggest oil
producer said earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation
and amortization climbed 33 percent in the second quarter.  OAO
Transneft  jumped as much as 8.6 percent after the Finance
Ministry proposed selling a 27.1 percent stake in the oil
pipeline operator.  OAO Sberbank , which the ministry also put
forward for asset-sales, added 1.2 percent. Those movements
pulled the 30-stock Micex Index 1.2 percent higher to 1,396.92
at the close in Moscow, its strongest level since June 21.  
 European regulators found last week that most of the
regions banks passed stress tests designed to determine if
lenders had sufficient capital to withstand a recession and a
sovereign crisis. Russia may raise about $29 billion by selling
minority stakes in 10 companies, the Finance Ministry said.  
 The proposed asset sales are “net positive” for the
market, said  Tom Mundy , a Moscow-based strategist at Renaissance
Capital. “The market seems to be digesting stress tests pretty
positively.”  
 Rosneft’s earnings, known as Ebitda, climbed to $4.75
billion, compared with a  consensus estimate  of $4.68 billion
according to Bloomberg data.  
 OAO Mechel , the country’s largest producer of coal for
steelmaking, jumped as much as 7.7 percent to 688 rubles, its
biggest intraday advance in two months. Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said July 23 he regretted a rebuke two years ago on the
company over coal prices that caused the shares to tumble.
