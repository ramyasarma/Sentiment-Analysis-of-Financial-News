             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index rose
for a sixth day, the longest winning streak since April, after
economists pared their bets for higher borrowing costs.  
 Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA  surged the most in two
months amid speculation Portugal Telecom SGPS SA may invest in
the Brazilian phone company, known as Oi.  MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA  led homebuilder gains amid speculation interest
rates will rise more slowly.  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo , Brazil’s
biggest Internet retailer, reached a one-month high. Pulp
producer  Fibria Celulose SA  advanced after Itau Unibanco Holding
SA raised its rating on the stock.  
 The  Bovespa  increased 0.2 percent to 66,443.26 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m. New York time. Thirty-eight
stocks gained on the measure while 23 fell. The  BM&FBovespa
Small Cap  index rose 0.2 percent. The real strengthened 0.6
percent to 1.7638 per dollar.  
 “A lower rate is favorable for equities, helping sectors
like retail and real estate,” said  Fausto Gouveia , who helps
manage 220 million reais ($124.7 million) in stocks at Legan
Administracao de Recursos in Sao Paulo. “This week will be
volatile as investors wait for the U.S. GDP data” on July 30.  
 The Bovespa rose on July 23, capping its biggest weekly
gain since May 2009, as better-than-estimated earnings in the
U.S. boosted confidence in the global economic recovery.  
 Analysts covering Brazil’s economy cut their year-end
forecast for the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point in a
weekly central bank survey after policy makers last week said
inflation risks have dropped.  
 The central bank’s eight-member board will raise the Selic
to 11.75 percent by year-end, compared with a week earlier
forecast of 12 percent, according to the median forecast in a
July 23 central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today. Policy makers meeting July 20-21 raised the overnight
rate to 10.75 percent from 10.25 percent, surprising 48 of 51
economists, who expected a 75-basis-point increase.  
 Rate Cuts  
 Brazil’s central bank will begin cutting the benchmark
lending rate next year, reversing much of this year’s increases,
according to Nomura Securities.  
 Policy makers will start lowering the overnight rate target
in the second quarter of 2011 and bring it to 10 percent by the
end of the year,  Tony Volpon , a Latin America strategist at
Nomura, said in a note to clients. Nomura had previously
forecast a year-end 2011 rate of 11.5 percent.  
 The Bovespa sank as much as 0.3 percent earlier in the day
on concern global economic growth is slowing.  
 Global Growth  
 Global growth may average 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent in
the next three to five years, less than the 4.7 percent pace of
the five years leading up to the 2008 slump, according to
 Stephen Roach , non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.  
 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA investor Banco Espirito Santo SA
said the telecommunications company should invest in Brazil if
it sells its stake in a venture that controls Brazilian wireless
operator Vivo Participacoes SA.  Oi , Brazil’s biggest phone
company, may have “great potential,” Banco Espirito Santo
Chief Executive Officer  Ricardo Salgado  said today.  
 Spanish newspaper El Economista reported today that
Portugal Telecom aims to own a stake of between 30 percent and
40 percent in Oi. Oi gained 4.5 percent to 29.75 reais.  
 Fibria , the world’s largest pulp producer, rose 2.4 percent
to a one-month high of 28.75 reais after Itau raised its
recommendation to “market perform” from “underperform,”
saying the stock price already reflects a “weaker” price
outlook for the papermaking raw material.  
 MRV Engenharia, Brazil’s fifth-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, increased 2.8 percent to 15.42 reais as the  BM&FBovespa
Real Estate Index  gained 0.6 percent. B2W rose 3.9 percent to
32.69 reais.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 12.9 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 12.2 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 16
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.6 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
