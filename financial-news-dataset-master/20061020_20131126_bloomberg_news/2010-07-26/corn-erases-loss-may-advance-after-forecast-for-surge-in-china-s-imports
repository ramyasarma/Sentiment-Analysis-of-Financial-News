             Corn futures fell on speculation
that favorable weather conditions in the Midwest will help boost
yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower.  
 Much of the Great Lakes region through the northern Plains
and the Rockies had “noticeably cooler and less humid
conditions ushering into the Midwest,” Accuweather.com said in
a report today. Corn has dropped 7.5 percent this year.  
 “The corn market, in particular, is feeling the weight of
favorable weather conditions in the U.S., which is the main
influence in the market,” said  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  
 Corn for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $3.8375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 11:52 a.m.
London time.  
 November-delivery soybeans dropped 0.8 percent to $9.7375 a
bushel and wheat for September delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$5.9225 a bushel.  
 The decline in wheat prices “could be simply a correction
from the strong prices that we’ve had the past couple of
weeks,” Commonwealth Bank’s Mathews said. “The market is
likely to trade in limbo” until the USDA updates its global
agricultural supply-and-demand estimates next month, he said.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery declined 1.1 percent to
177.75 euros ($229) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe, the first drop
in four days.
