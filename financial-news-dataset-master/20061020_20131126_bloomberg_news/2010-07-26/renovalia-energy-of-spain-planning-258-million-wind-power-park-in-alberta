             Renovalia Energy SA, the Spanish
solar and wind power producer that in May postponed an initial
public offering, said it plans a 200-million euro ($258 million)
wind park in Canada’s Alberta province.  
 The facility will have an electricity generating capacity
of 120 megawatts, and construction will begin the first quarter
of 2011, Renovalia said today in an e-mailed statement.
