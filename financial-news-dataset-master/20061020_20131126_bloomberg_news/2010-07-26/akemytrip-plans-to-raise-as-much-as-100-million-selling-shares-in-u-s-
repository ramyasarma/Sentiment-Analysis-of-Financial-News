             MakeMyTrip Ltd., India’s largest
online travel company, aims to raise as much as $100 million on
the Nasdaq Stock Market to become the nation’s first firm to
hold an initial share sale in the U.S. in four years.  
 Morgan Stanley , Oppenheimer & Co. and Pacific Crest
Securities LLC will manage the offering, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission  filing  yesterday. The company
will be India’s first to list in the U.S. since Mumbai-based
back-office services provider  WNS Holdings Ltd.  raised $255
million in July 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  
 MakeMyTrip, based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, will use the
proceeds from the share sale to acquire or invest in businesses
and for working capital, it said. The company is the largest
Indian online travel firm based on gross bookings last year, it
said, citing data from travel research firm PhoCusWright Inc.  
 The company began operations in 2000 by offering travel
services to non-resident Indians in the U.S., according to the
filing. It started offering services domestically in September
2005, and posted a loss of $6.2 million for the year ended
March, according to the filing.
