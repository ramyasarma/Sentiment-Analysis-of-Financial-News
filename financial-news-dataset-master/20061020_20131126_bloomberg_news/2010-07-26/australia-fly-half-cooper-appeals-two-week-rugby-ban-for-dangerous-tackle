             Australia fly-half Quade Cooper
appealed against his two-week rugby ban for a dangerous tackle
in the Wallabies’ 30-13 win over the Springboks two days ago,
South African, New Zealand and Australian Rugby said.  
 Cooper was yesterday suspended by a SANZAR judicial officer
for a tackle on South Africa’s Morne Steyn, ruling him out of
the July 31 and Aug. 7 Tri-Nations matches against New Zealand.  
 Details of when Cooper’s appeal will be heard will be given
tomorrow, SANZAR said in an e-mailed statement.
