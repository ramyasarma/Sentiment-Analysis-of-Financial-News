             British Airways Plc’s cabin-crew
union said today that it’ll resume talks over pay and staffing
levels next week while preparing for legal action over the
company’s withdrawal of travel benefits for striking workers.  
 Europe’s third-largest airline breached European human
rights legislation when it scrapped the perks for workers who
walked out during the 18-month dispute, according to the Unite
union, which represents the carrier’s 12,000 flight attendants.
British Airways said it was a preparing a response to the claim.  
 Unite will resume talks with the carrier next week under
the auspices of the U.K.’s state-funded Advisory, Conciliation
and Arbitration Service, it said in a statement. The labor group
said it’s also preparing to provide additional financial support
to members who have been docked additional pay for striking.  
 “Unite remains determined to secure a settlement to this
dispute acceptable to cabin crew,” Unite Joint General
Secretaries  Derek Simpson  and  Tony Woodley  said in the
statement. “Until such an agreement is secured, we will
continue to support our members financially and legally.”  
 While cabin crew rejected the latest pay and contract terms
from British Airways in a recent vote, the resolution of the
dispute has been “impeded” by sanctions taken against striking
workers without proper disciplinary procedures, Unite said.
