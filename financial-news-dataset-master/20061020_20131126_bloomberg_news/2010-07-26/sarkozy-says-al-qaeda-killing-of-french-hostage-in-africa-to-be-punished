             Niger’s military leader  Djibo Salou 
said his government will help fight the al-Qaeda-linked group
that killed a French hostage in Africa’s Sahel region.  
 Salou’s remarks were conveyed by French Foreign Minister
 Bernard Kouchner , who met with the general yesterday in Niamey.  
 Michel Germaneau, a 78-year-old aid worker, was kidnapped
in April by Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb, which is active along
the desert borders of Algeria, Mali, Niger and Mauritania.
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  confirmed this week that
Germaneau had been killed.  
 Niger is ready to “take the necessary action” against
terrorism in the Sahel, Kouchner cited Salou as saying.
