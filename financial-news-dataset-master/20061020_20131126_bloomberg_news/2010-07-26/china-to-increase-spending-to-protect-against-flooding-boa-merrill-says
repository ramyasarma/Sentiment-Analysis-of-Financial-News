             China will accelerate  investment  in
infrastructure after the nation suffered from the worst
flooding in a decade, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said.  
 “The floods turn the popular belief that China is
excessively overbuilt on its head,” Bank of America-Merrill
economists led by  Lu Ting , said in an e-mailed note today.
“Fixed-asset investment in water projects could be used as a
major tool to bolster China’s growth in the upcoming period.”  
 China will speed up investments in water reservoirs and
river banks, according to the report, which said about half of
the country’s 80,000 small and medium-sized reservoirs are old.  
 Floods in southern China killed more than 700 people and
caused about 142 billion yuan ($21 billion) of economic losses
this year, the  State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters  said July 21. Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and
ING Groep NV cut their outlook for China’s 2010 growth after
the expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the second quarter.  
 The impact of the deluge on  inflation  this year will be
“limited” overall and the central bank is “unlikely to
respond to the inflation spike purely induced by natural
disasters,” Hong Kong-based Lu said. Price growth may
accelerate to 3.5 percent in July from last month’s 2.9 percent
on rising vegetable prices, Lu forecast. He expects consumer
prices will rise 2.9 percent on average in 2010.  
 Urban fixed-asset investment gained 25.5 percent in the
first six months of 2010 from a year earlier, the statistics
bureau said July 15. The pace moderated from a 33.6 percent
increase in the first half of 2009, when a 4 trillion yuan
fiscal stimulus program was kicking in.
