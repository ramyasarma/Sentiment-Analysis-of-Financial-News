             L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  is being questioned today by French police
investigating allegations ranging from tax fraud to invasion of
privacy.  
 Bettencourt is being questioned at her home in the Paris
suburb of Neuilly, said a spokeswoman for the Nanterre
prosecutor who is leading the investigations. She said she
couldn’t be identified, citing office policy.  
 The investigations were prompted by secret recordings made
by the one-time butler of Europe’s wealthiest woman. The tapes
sparked a controversy over alleged campaign-finance law
violations, tax evasion and influence peddling which has touched
both French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and Labor Minister  Eric Woerth .  
 Woerth’s wife, who previously advised Bettencourt on how to
invest her L’Oreal dividends, was questioned by police last week
and the minister will be questioned this week, the prosecutor’s
spokeswoman said.  
 Calls to Bettencourt’s spokeswoman and lawyer for comment
on the questioning weren’t immediately returned.  
 The recordings were released in the French press a month
before a trial, since postponed, over claims by her daughter
that her 87-year-old mother was manipulated into giving a
photographer friend about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in
gifts. Bettencourt lost a bid on July 23 to block their use by
media outlets when the Paris appeals court found the excerpts
were of legitimate public interest.
