             Softbank Corp.  rose to the highest
in more than two and a half years in Tokyo trading after the
Nikkei newspaper said operating profit at the wireless carrier
rose 80 percent to a record in first quarter.  
 Softbank , Japan’s third-largest mobile-phone operator,
added as much 4.2 percent to 2,622 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the highest level since Dec. 6, 2007. The shares
traded at 2,601 yen at 10:54 a.m., local time. The benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 1.3 percent.  
 The company, Japan’s exclusive provider of  Apple Inc. ’s
iPhone, is forecasting a record 500 billion yen ($5.7 billion)
operating profit in the year ending March 2011. Operating income
probably rose to 190 billion yen in the three months to June 30,
the Nikkei report said, citing demand for the iPhone. Softbank’s
biggest single-quarter profit was 136 billion yen for the
October-December period of 2009, it said.  
 The Tokyo-based carrier is not the source of the report and
will report first-quarter earnings on July 29, Softbank said in
a statement today.
