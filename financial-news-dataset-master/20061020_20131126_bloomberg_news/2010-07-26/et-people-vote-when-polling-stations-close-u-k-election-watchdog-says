             The U.K.’s Electoral Commission
urged the government to pass new legislation as soon as possible
after more than 1,200 people standing in line when polling
stations closed in the May general election were denied a vote.  
 “We want the government to change the law to make clear
that eligible electors who are entitled to vote at a polling
station and who are in the queue to enter the polling station at
the close of poll will be allowed to vote,” the  independent
watchdog  said in its report on the election today.  
 Voters were denied the chance to vote in 16 of 649
electoral districts when the polls closed at 10 p.m. on May 6,
the London-based commission said in an e-mailed statement. It
said the main reasons why lines formed were “poor planning, the
use of unsuitable buildings, inadequate staffing arrangements
and the failure of contingency plans.”  
 As the results came in on election night, television
stations showed footage of  angry voters  who’d been turned away.
Turnout in England, Scotland and Wales rose to 65.1 percent from
61.4 percent at the last elections in 2005 after a campaign that
produced the first coalition government since World War II.  
 Among the districts affected was Hallam in Sheffield, where
Liberal Democrat leader  Nick Clegg , now the deputy prime
minister, was re-elected.  
 “In the vast majority of constituencies elections were
well run, but this is despite the system, not because of it,”
 Jenny Watson , who heads the commission, said in the statement.
“Voter confidence is fragile and may take time to rebuild.”  
 Three out of 10 voters were not very or not at all
confident that the elections were well run, the watchdog said,
citing an Ipsos Mori survey it commissioned. That compared with
just 4 percent at local elections held the previous year. There
was no comparable survey in 2005.  
 The commission said the government should look at extending
the timetable for elections from the current 17 working days to
reduce officials’ workload. It also suggested considering
whether people should be allowed to vote in advance in person to
help increase turnout and whether voters should have to produce
some form of identification to reduce fraud.
