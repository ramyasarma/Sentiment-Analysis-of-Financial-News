             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell to the lowest in
at least five weeks, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 1 basis point to 118 basis
points as of 9:02 a.m. in Singapore, the lowest since May 13,
Credit Agricole CIB and CMA prices show.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
117 basis points as of 9:23 a.m. in Sydney, a five-week low,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc. and CMA.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 4 basis points to 118 as
of 10:08 a.m. in Tokyo, the lowest since May 14, Morgan Stanley
and CMA prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
