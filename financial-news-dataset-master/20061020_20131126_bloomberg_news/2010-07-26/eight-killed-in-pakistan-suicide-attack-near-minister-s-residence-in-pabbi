             A suicide bomber blew himself up
outside the home of Provincial Information Minister Mian
Iftikhar Hussain in Pakistan’s northwest town of Pabbi, two days
after the minister’s son was gunned down.  
 Eight people, including three policemen, were killed and 17
were injured in today’s attack, Mirza Khan, a police spokesman
said by telephone. Hussain’s son was shot dead on July 24 and
people were gathering at his residence to offer condolences when
the bomb exploded.
