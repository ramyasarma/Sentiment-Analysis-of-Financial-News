             “We’ve been coming here for four
decades,” ZZ Top’s lead singer Billy Gibbons tells a London
audience as the band gears up for the next leg of its world
tour. “Same three guys. Same three chords.”  
 Gibbons smiles from behind the trademark shades and cowboy
hat. He and bassist Dusty Hill still sport navel-length beards.
Together with the neatly trimmed Frank Beard on drums, they
demonstrate how to survive 40 years on three chords (and a few
more -- they are being ironic).  
 There are hits, such as “Gimme All Your Loving” and
“Cheap Sunglasses.” There are razor-sharp blues; backing
visuals of car parts and girls; solos made electrifying because
of their lack of flamboyance. The soundboards threaten to melt
in the heat as the volume blasts out.  
 ZZ Top  -- which plays across the U.S. and Europe this
summer -- is the highlight of the  High Voltage Festival  at the
weekend. As the dinosaurs prowl Victoria Park, it is as if the
last 30 years haven’t happened. Gary Moore,  UFO  and  Foreigner 
arrive with monster riffs and shampooed manes.  
 Hordes of long-haired men, their antique rock shirts
struggling with more recent beer bellies, celebrate with
vigorous nodding, two devil horn salutes and more beer.  
 Rock and metal is, in 2010, producing a vast amount of
innovative exciting music. High Voltage focuses mostly on rock
gods from a more distant age.  
 Saxon , a stalwart of the early 1980s new wave of U.K.
heavy metal, says it all with a rip-roaring song about joining
the 12th-century crusades.  
 Dio’s Memory  
 Tony Iommi  and bassist  Geezer Butler , who formed  Heaven &
Hell  after Black Sabbath, deliver cast iron riffage in memory
of singer  Ronnie James Dio , who died in May. Glenn Hughes and
 Jorn Lande  share vocal duties, followed by a speech from Dio’s
 widow .  
 The relative newcomers on the bill are better.  Cathedral 
impresses with its monumental doom. The hairy  Black Label
Society  has skull-adorned mic stands and takes hard-fried
southern rock to deranged extremes.  Opeth  mixes metal and prog
rock to delight goth onlookers.  
 Bands like  Asia  and  Transatlantic  seem oblivious to the
progressions made by rock in recent decades. This is probably
because they were busy writing intricate keyboard solos.  
 “This one’s called ‘Latex Solar Beef,’” announces one
 performer , so identifying himself as  Dweezil Zappa .  
 Uriah Heep, sometimes described as Light Zeppelin, provide
seriously guilty pleasures.  Argent  thrills with renditions of
“Hold Your Head Up” and “God Gave Rock ‘n’ Roll to You.”  
 Marillion is pompous -- and then Sunday’s headliners
Emerson Lake and Palmer take pomp to unheard-of levels. Carl
Palmer’s drumming is rigorous, Greg Lake’s lyrics embarrassing.
 Keith Emerson  confronts a battery of synthesizers and attacks
them. His flash finger work is clumsy and out of time.  
 Rating: *** for ZZ Top; ** for most others.  
 The ZZ Top tour continues across the U.S., returning to
Europe in October. There are shows in Paris, Oslo, Stockholm,
Dallas, Houston and New York. Information:
