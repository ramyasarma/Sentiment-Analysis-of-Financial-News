             QBE Insurance Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s biggest insurer by market value, fell the most in
five months in Sydney trading after its first-half insurance
profit margin missed the company’s target range.  
 QBE lost 5.6 percent to A$16.97 at the close, the biggest
decline since Feb. 26. The  benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index  climbed
0.6 percent.  
 The  margin  in the six months ended June 30 was 15.7 percent,
below QBE’s 2010 target of between 16 percent and 18 percent and
lower than the 17.5 percent reported a year earlier, the Sydney-
based company said in a statement today.  
 QBE attributed the result to “the impact of lower interest
yields on claims provisions, reduced yields on policyholders’
funds and the record level of catastrophes,” according to its
statement.  
 The company, which maintained the full-year margin target,
said profit after tax in the first half dropped 40 percent from
A$1.02 billion ($920 million) a year ago because of lower
investment income.
