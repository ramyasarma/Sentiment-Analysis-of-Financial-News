             Insurance Australia Group Ltd. , the
Sydney-based insurer formed in 1925, said fiscal-year profit
halved after rising claims at its loss-making U.K. unit.  
 Net income  in the year ended June 30 fell to A$91 million
($82 million) from A$181 million a year ago, Insurance Australia
said in a statement today based on preliminary data. The company
removed its top U.K. executive,  Neil Utley , after he oversaw a
A$367 million second-half charge at his division.  
 Insurance Australia fell the most in almost two months in
Sydney trading as natural disaster claims also overran internal
forecasts and the group set aside more funds to bolster reserves.
The company has blamed rising personal injury claims among U.K.
drivers and today replaced Utley with  Ian Foy , head of the New
Zealand unit.  
 “This year’s financial result does not reflect the
expectations we held at the outset of the year,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mike Wilkins  said in the statement. “I’m
encouraged by the clear and ongoing improvement in the
operational performance of our businesses in Australia and New
Zealand.”  
 The  stock  dropped 4.3 percent to A$3.35, the biggest
decline since June 2, at the 4:10 p.m. local time close. The
shares have fallen 17 percent this year.  
 The insurance profit margin for the year was 7 percent,
matching a reduced forecast announced in June. For the fiscal
year ending June 2011, the margin will be between 10.5 percent
and 12.5 percent, Insurance Australia said.  
 Full results will be released on Aug. 26.
