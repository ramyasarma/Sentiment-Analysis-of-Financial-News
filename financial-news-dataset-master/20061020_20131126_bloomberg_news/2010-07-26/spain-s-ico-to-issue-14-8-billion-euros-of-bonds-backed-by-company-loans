             Instituto de Credito Oficial, a
Spanish government agency that lends to businesses, plans to
issue 14.8 billion euros ($19.22 billion) of bonds backed by
company loans.  
 Madrid-based ICO’s notes will be backed by 22.9 billion
euros ($29.7 billion) of loans to companies, according to a
Moody’s Investors Service report on the transaction. The
securities will be issued through a special-purpose fund known
as ICO Mediacion II AyT F.T.A., according to the ratings
company’s statement.  
 Amid the financial crisis, Spanish banks have put together
asset-backed bond issues that they don’t sell, instead using
them as collateral for European Central Bank loans. The nation’s
banks borrowed a record 126.3 billion euros from the ECB in
June, according to data compiled by the Bank of Spain.  
 Spain’s financial companies are in the spotlight after five
of the nation’s savings banks were among just seven lenders to
fail the European Union’s stress tests, which were designed to
gauge banks’ financial health. The sovereign deficit crisis that
started in Greece in April and roiled markets throughout the
region sparked concern that Spain’s banks faced losses on their
government debt holdings, on top of the $565 billion European
lenders have already lost or written down since 2007.  
 Extra Yield  
 The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
government bonds instead of benchmark German bunds widened from
59 basis points on Dec. 31 to as much as 221 basis points on
June 16, and was at 148 basis points at 5 p.m. in London today.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The cost of insuring against losses on Spanish government
debt using credit-default swaps fell 9 basis points to 193.5
today, the lowest level since May 19, according to data provider
CMA. The contracts are down from a record 275 basis points May
6.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.
