             Barton Biggs , the hedge fund manager
who became more optimistic about stocks this month, said that  BP
Plc  is still “too speculative” to buy.  
 After losing about 40 percent of its share price since the
start of the worst oil spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of
Mexico, BP has  rebounded 37 percent  since the end of June. BP
put a cap over the leaking well to stop the flow of oil and is
on track to kill it completely in the next few weeks.  
 “It’s too speculative for me,” Biggs said in an interview
with Bloomberg Radio today. “Are these people down in the Gulf
who aren’t going to be able to fish and their business was
fishing, are they going to be able to sue BP for payments for
the next 20 years? I don’t know, it’s too hard to call.”  
 The comments show that Biggs, who said he is now 75 percent
net long on stocks after selling half his equity holdings at the
start of July, disagrees with the  30 analysts  in a Bloomberg
Story who have a “buy” rating on BP stock. Just two analysts
recommend selling it.  
 Biggs, whose Traxis Partners LLC gained 38 percent in 2009
when he bought equities as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell
to a 12-year low, said on July 2 that concern governments around
the world curtail stimulus measures too soon led him to sell
about half of his stock investments.  
 The S&P 500 has risen 7.8 percent since that day on
optimism about corporate profits. Biggs has owned BP in the
past.  
 New CEO  
 The company will announce that Robert Dudley will replace
 Tony Hayward  as chief executive officer soon, people familiar
with the matter said yesterday. The company is due to report
second-quarter results tomorrow and may give a prediction of the
company’s total bill from the spill.  
 BP’s market value  has dropped by about 50 billion pounds
($77 billion) as it battled to stop the spill. The well has now
been sealed, and BP plans to permanently plug it with cement
next month.  
 The median of 11 analyst estimates of the total costs is
$33 billion, a Bloomberg News survey of 11 shows, with
predictions ranging from $17 billion to $60 billion. Louisiana
Treasurer  John Kennedy  has said the total cost of the spill may
reach $100 billion.  
 Fadel Gheit , the analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York
who gave the highest cost estimate in the survey of $60 billion,
said BP was still worth buying.  
 “The upside potential is significantly greater than the
downside risk,” Gheit said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“The number one priority is to cap this well once and for all.
Everything else that comes after that will be manageable.”
