             Czech business and  consumer
confidence  rose to the highest level in 22 months in July as
rising demand for the country’s exports drove a recovery from
the recession.  
 The composite indicator of business and consumer confidence
increased to 7.8, the strongest reading since September 2008,
from 5.4 in June, the Prague-based statistics office  said  in a
statement on its website today. The business-confidence
indicator rose to 11.6 from 8.6, while the gauge for consumers
improved to minus 7.3 from minus 7.5.  
 The export-driven Czech economy is emerging from the worst
recession since the end of communism two decades ago after
demand for its goods collapsed in key western European markets.
Gross domestic product rose 1.1 percent annually in the first
quarter of the year, after a 3.2 percent contraction in the
final three months of last year.  
 The confidence indicators may range from minus 100, if all
respondents are pessimistic, to 100, if all are optimistic.
