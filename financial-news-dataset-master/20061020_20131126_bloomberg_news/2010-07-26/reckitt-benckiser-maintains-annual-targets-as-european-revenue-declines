             Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc , which
last week agreed to buy the maker of  Durex condoms , maintained
its target for annual profit after reporting a decline in sales
in Europe, its largest market.  
 Revenue in Europe, which accounts for 43 percent of sales,
fell 1 percent in the first half, Slough, England-based Reckitt
said today. The maker of Nurofen painkillers expects sales
growth of 5 percent this year and a 10 percent rise in operating
profit, excluding its pharmaceutical unit.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Bart Becht , who has earned a
reputation for increasing  earnings  guidance, said the slowdown
in Europe was driven by a combination of “disappearing market
growth” and increased promotions on products such as Vanish
stain remover as the company looks to stem competition from
 Procter & Gamble & Co.  Reckitt lost market share in fabric care,
he said.  
 “The reporting confirms our thesis that it will be very
difficult for Reckitt to significantly beat its full-year 2010
targets, never mind increase them,” said  Andrew Wood , an
analyst at Sanford Bernstein. He called the decline in Europe
“the most significant and worrisome aspect of the results.”  
 Reckitt fell  as much as 1.5 percent in London trading, and
was down 43 pence, or 1.3 percent, to 3,293 pence at 8:54 a.m.
The stock has fallen 1.9 percent this year, compared to Procter
& Gamble’s Co.’s 2.1 percent increase.  
 SSL Purchase  
 The maker of Strepsil throat lozenges last week announced a
plan to buy SSL International Plc for $3.9 billion, adding Durex
condoms and Scholl footcare to its brands. Finance Director
 Colin Day  declined to comment further on the acquisition today,
citing takeover rules.  
 “We continue to be interested in any project that fits our
strategic objective so that’s not the end of M&A,” Day said.
Reckitt has the capability to raise another 5 billion pounds
($7.7 billion) or 6 billion pounds, he said, “so we have the
appropriate funds if we saw a suitable project.”  
 Operating profit climbed 21 percent, ahead of analyst
estimates, to 503 million pounds. Sales rose 10 percent to 2.06
billion pounds and the interim dividend was raised to 50 pence.
