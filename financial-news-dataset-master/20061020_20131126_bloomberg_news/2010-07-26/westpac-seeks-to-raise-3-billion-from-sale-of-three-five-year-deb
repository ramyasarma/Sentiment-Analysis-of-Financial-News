             Westpac Banking Corp ., Australia’s
second-biggest lender, plans to sell $3 billion of dollar-
denominated debt in two parts as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  
 The bank plans to sell $1 billion of three-year notes that
may yield 117 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, and $2 billion of five-year notes that may pay a 137
basis-point spread, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 The debt from the Sydney-based bank may be rated Aa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service and AA by Standard & Poor’s, the
person said. The offering represents Westpac’s biggest issue in
the U.S. corporate bond market since Dec. 7, when it sold $3
billion of bonds in two parts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the nation’s biggest
lender.
