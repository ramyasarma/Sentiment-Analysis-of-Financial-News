             BP Plc , the U.K.-based oil company
that’s struggling to raise cash to pay for the Gulf of Mexico
oil disaster, may sell all or part of its 50 percent share of
TNK-BP Holding, a joint venture that operates in Russia and
Ukraine, the London-based Times reported.  
 If the company decides to go ahead with a sale, the
likeliest buyers are Russia’s OAO Gazprom and Rosneft Oil Co.,
the newspaper said.  
 TNK-BP has been highly profitable for BP since its creation
seven years ago, though the British company’s relationship with
the group of oligarchs who own the other 50 percent have been
troubled, the Times said.
