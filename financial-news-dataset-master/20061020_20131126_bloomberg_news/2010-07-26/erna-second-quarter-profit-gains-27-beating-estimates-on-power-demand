             Terna Rete Elettrica Nazionale SpA ,
the operator of Italy’s power grid, said first-half profit rose
27 percent after power demand picked up.  
 Net income rose to 233.5 million euros ($301.4 million)
from 184 million euros, excluding assets sold in Brazil,
according to a statement distributed through the Italian
exchange. Including profit from discontinued operations, net
income rose 13 percent to 233.6 million euros. That beat the  204
million-euro  mean estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  
 “We estimate that 2010 will exceed expectations,” Chief
Executive Officer  Flavio Cattaneo  said in the statement. Terna
forecasts that the recovery in energy demand will continue in
the second half.  
 Terna in April 2009 sold a controlling stake in Terna
Partecipacoes SA to Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, Brazil’s
biggest combined power generator and distributor.
