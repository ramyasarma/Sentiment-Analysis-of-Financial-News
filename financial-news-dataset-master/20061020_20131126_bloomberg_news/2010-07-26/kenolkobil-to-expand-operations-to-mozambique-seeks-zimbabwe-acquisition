             KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in seven African countries, said it
plans to expand into Mozambique and Zimbabwe in an effort to
boost sales.  
 Expanding into Mozambique would give the retailer access to
most nations with a port along Africa’s east coast, the Nairobi-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. KenolKobil
wants to boost fuel sales in countries including Zambia, Malawi
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, it said.  
 In Zimbabwe, the company is seeking an acquisition, having
gained experience from an earlier failed attempt, it said,
without commenting further.  
 “We learnt lessons on how to invest in Zimbabwe, and now
fully understand the requirement of the indigenization law,”
KenolKobil said. “We shall therefore continue to explore all
opportunities available to invest in Zimbabwe.”  
 Zimbabwe’s Indigenization and Empowerment Act, announced
earlier this year, compels all foreign and white-owned companies
to sell 51 percent of their shareholdings to black Zimbabweans
within five years.
