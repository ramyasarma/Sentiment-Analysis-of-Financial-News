             (Corrects offer price in third paragraph.)  
 Inpex Corp. , Japan’s largest energy
explorer, advanced in Tokyo after Deutsche Securities Inc.
reaffirmed its “buy” rating on the stock, saying a $6 billion
equity-financing plan is a long-term positive.  
 The shares rose 4.9 percent to close at 430,000 yen, the
 best performer  on the 44-member MSCI AC ASIA Pacific Energy
Index. It was the biggest gain since July 12.  
 Inpex dropped to an all-time low last week after announcing
plans to raise as much as 587.2 billion yen ($6.7 billion) to
fund new developments, chiefly the Ichthys natural-gas project
in Australia. The explorer has set the price for new shares at
417,100 yen each and aims to raise as much as 520 billion yen,
it said in a filing to Japan’s finance ministry after trading
closed today.  
 “We see major upside potential for the shares, based on
three new major oil and gas fields of Ichthys, Abadi and
Kashagan,” Deutsche analyst  Tomohiro Jikihara  wrote in a report
dated yesterday. “The use of equity financing indicates a
strong level of commitment to the Ichthys Project, and is a long
term positive.”  
 Jikihara revised his 12-month share-price estimate to
667,000 yen from 1,191,000 yen. The recent share price
correction already reflects the dilution that equity financing
will cause, he wrote.
