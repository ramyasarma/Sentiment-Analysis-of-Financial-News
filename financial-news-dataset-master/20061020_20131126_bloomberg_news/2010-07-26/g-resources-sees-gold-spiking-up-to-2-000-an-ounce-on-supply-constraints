             G-Resources Group Ltd.,  whose
development of a gold mine in Indonesia has been delayed by six
months, said prices may reach $2,000 an ounce because of supply
constraints and investment demand.  
 “We’ve got no doubts you’ll see spikes up to $1,500 and
probably $2,000 over the next few years,” G-Resources Vice
Chairman  Owen Hegarty  said in an interview. “Demand is strong
and is only going to get stronger. Constraints on supply have
seen production fall in past decade, and the discovery and
development of new mines just hasn’t caught up.”  
 Gold reached a record $1,265.30 on June 21 as investors
sought to protect their wealth against financial turmoil and
declining currencies. Hong Kong-based G-Resources said yesterday
that floods had increased the costs of its  Martabe  project by
$80 million to $440 million.  
 “We still have enough money in the bank to pay those extra
capital costs,” Hegarty said in an interview on July 23. The
company is targeting full-year output of 250,000 ounces.  
 G-Resources rose 1.4 percent to 36 cents at 9:50 a.m. in
Hong Kong. They’ve dropped 27 percent this year. The Martabe
start-up was delayed to the fourth quarter next year, the
company said July 11. Its earlier target was the first-quarter.  
 “It’s cost us six months in time,” Hegarty said.  
 Hiring Leighton  
 Leighton Holdings Ltd.  was awarded a $150 million contract
for an initial 65 months to operate mining services at  Martabe ,
G-Resources said today in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange.  
 G-Resources sold $587 million in shares last year to fund
the acquisition and development of the Indonesian mine. The
company is considering more acquisitions in Asia, Hegarty said.  
 “Indonesia in particular looks great, but we’re also
looking in Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and China,” he
said. “We’re looking at projects that already have a resource,
or perhaps in projects being built by companies that need some
help. We’d prefer an operation.”  
 Newcrest Mining Ltd.,  Australia’s largest gold mining
company, has agreed to buy Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea-based
Lihir Gold Ltd., the No. 2 producer traded on the Australian
stock exchange, to create the world’s fifth-biggest gold company.  
 “It’s happening at the big end of town,” Hegarty said.
“Newcrest has to be acquisitive because in needs to continue to
add gold to its portfolio. The smaller companies will be looking
toward consolidation to grow their resource base.”  
 UBS AG raised its 2010 price forecast for bullion to $1,205
an ounce on July 23. Bullion for immediate delivery fell 20
cents to $1,189 an ounce at 6:06 a.m. Perth time today.
