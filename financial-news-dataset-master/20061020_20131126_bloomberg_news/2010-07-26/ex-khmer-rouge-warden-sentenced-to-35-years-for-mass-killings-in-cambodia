             A United Nations-backed tribunal
found the top Khmer Rouge prison warden guilty of mass killings
in Cambodia, the first conviction after a 13-year effort to
holder leaders of the failed regime to account.  
 Kang Kek Ieu, also known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years
in prison, a live broadcast of the trial verdict showed. The
regime has been blamed for the deaths of at least 1.7 million
people from 1975 and 1979. Prosecutors had been seeking a 40-
year jail sentence for Duch, who is 67.
