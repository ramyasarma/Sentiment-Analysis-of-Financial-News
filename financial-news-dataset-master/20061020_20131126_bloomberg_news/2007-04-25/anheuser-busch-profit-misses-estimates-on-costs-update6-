             Anheuser-Busch Cos. (BUD)  said first-
quarter profit rose 3.7 percent, less than analysts estimated, on
increased advertising for Bud Light and imported beers.  
 Shares fell 2.8 percent, the biggest drop since July 2005.  
 Marketing and administration costs rose 8.1 percent as the
brewer spent more to keep drinkers from switching to Miller Lite.
Anheuser-Busch also advertised InBev NV's European brands Bass
and Beck's after it took over U.S. distribution in February.  
 ``There are some big costs for getting these InBev brands on
board before the key holiday selling season,'' said Mariann Montagne, an analyst with Minneapolis-based Thrivent Asset
Management. U.S. Memorial Day on May 28 marks the start of the
season, she said.  
 Net income increased to $517.5 million, or 67 cents a share,
from $499.2 million, or 64 cents, a year earlier, the world's
second-largest brewer said today in a release. Profit trailed
analysts'  estimates  by 2 cents.  
 Shares of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch fell $1.45 to
$50.90 at 4:02 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange  composite trading ,
the biggest drop since July 27, 2005. They've gained 19 percent
in the past year, compared with a 41 percent gain for InBev NV,
the world's biggest brewer by sales.  
 Missed Analysts' Estimates  
 Sales increased 2.7 percent to $3.86 billion for the
quarter, from $3.76 billion a year earlier. Revenue missed the
average estimate of $3.93 billion estimated by 8 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Marketing and administrative costs exceeded the $615.7
million anticipated by Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello.
These costs totaled $665.7 million, according to the brewer.  
 Anheuser-Busch's domestic beer volume rose less than 1
percent after some wholesalers cut inventory levels to lower
their costs, which caused U.S. profit before income taxes to fall
1.6 percent to $762.1 million.  
 Shipments to retailers have dropped 3 percent so far in
April, Chief Financial Officer Randy Baker said today on a
conference call with investors.  
 ``Beer is weak in the U.S. right now, and they're struggling
with that,'' said Montagne, whose company has $70 billion in
assets including Anheuser-Busch stock.  
 Revenue per barrel rose 2.3 percent, missing the 3 percent
estimated by Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst  Judy Hong .  
 Losing Market Share  
 Excluding acquisitions of  brands  such as Rolling Rock,
domestic beer shipments to retailers dropped 1.6 percent,
Pecoriello said today in a research note. Beer volume ``remains a
concern,'' he wrote.  
 Market share in the U.S. slipped to 50.2 percent from 50.9 a
year earlier, said the 147-year-old company whose origins trace
back to a Bavarian  brewery .  
 ``The biggest problem facing these guys is they control the
lion's share of a very competitive market that's not growing
much,'' said Jack White, director of research at Todd Investment
Advisors in Louisville,  Kentucky . The firm has $3.5 billion in
assets including Anheuser-Busch shares.  
 Anheuser-Busch boosted spending on marketing to win back
drinkers, including one spot in which two men play a rock-paper-
scissors hand game to determine who gets the last Bud Light. One
man makes a signal, while the other man throws an actual rock to
knock out his opponent and win the beer.  
 Rival SABMiller Plc has run ads saying its Miller Lite
tastes better than Bud Light, and the London-based brewer plans
additional commercials later this year.  
 International Sales  
 Outside the U.S. , Anheuser-Busch said volume rose 8.7
percent on gains in  China  and  Canada .  
 Equity income from Anheuser's stake in  Grupo Modelo SA (GMODELOC)  and
China's Tsingtao Brewery Co. rose 30 percent to $159.4 million.  
 Anheuser's wholesalers have taken over about 60 percent of
InBev's European volume for beers including Beck's and Stella,
Baker said during the call. There have been ``some disruptions''
such as brands being out-of-stock at stores and insufficient
reordering when inventories are low, he said.  
 Anheuser-Busch's long-term target is to boost  earnings  per
share by 7 percent to 10 percent a year. The company doesn't give
quarterly forecasts.  
 The company repurchased more than 9 million shares during
the first quarter, the company said today.  
 Of the 17 analysts who follow the brewer of Michelob and
O'Doul's, seven  rate  it a ``buy,'' eight say ``hold'' and two
recommend selling.
