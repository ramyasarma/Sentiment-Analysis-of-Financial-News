The discount of Asia gasoil prices
to European levels narrowed from the widest in more than 18
months as traders grew concerned that supplies in Europe will
rise after arbitrage cargoes are shipped across.  The  East-West  gasoil spread for October narrowed for the
first time in more than a week to $19.75 a barrel at 10:32 a.m.
Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates. The
spread yesterday was $20.75, the widest since March 3, 2009.
Cargoes of diesel with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur are making
the voyage from Northeast Asia to Europe, traders said.  Gasoil futures for October traded on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange are at a $1.50 a metric ton premium to the November
contract, a market situation known as backwardation and one that
indicates prompt demand is high.  Gasoil processing profits  for Asia dropped to $12.32 a
barrel from $12.34 a barrel yesterday, data from PVM showed.
 Gasoil  swaps fell 60 cents to $87.80 a barrel after crude oil
fell in New York, signaling that the demand recovery in the U.S.
may falter.  Swaps for fuel oil  fell $2.50 to $450 a ton, data from PVM
showed.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed to $6.25 a
barrel from $6.44 a barrel yesterday as stockpiles fell in
Singapore.  Prices of  naphtha  for delivery between mid-November and
mid-December were at $687.25 a ton yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
