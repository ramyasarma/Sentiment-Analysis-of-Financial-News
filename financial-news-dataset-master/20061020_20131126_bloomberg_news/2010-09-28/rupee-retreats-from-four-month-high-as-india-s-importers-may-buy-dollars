India’s rupee weakened the most in
three weeks, retreating from near the strongest level since May,
on speculation local importers will boost dollar purchases to
settle month-end bills.  The currency is still up 4.2 percent for this month, a
performance second only to South Korea’s won among Asia’s 10
most-used currencies, and there is speculation the  Reserve Bank
of India  may combat gains to help protect exporters’ earnings.
The central bank may say this week that the nation’s quarterly
 current-account  deficit held near a record as imports picked up,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Dollar demand from importers is expected to increase as
we approach the end of the month and that will cap rupee gains
for now,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager at Federal Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The RBI may intervene to protect exporters
since the rupee has already rallied quite a bit.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 45.155 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 44.995 yesterday, its strongest
level since May 13. It may trade between 45.00 and 45.30 this
week, Paul predicted.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.76 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.68
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  Annual  growth  in India’s overseas sales slowed to 13.2
percent in July from 30.4 percent the previous month, government
data show. Import growth accelerated to 34.3 percent from 23
percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
