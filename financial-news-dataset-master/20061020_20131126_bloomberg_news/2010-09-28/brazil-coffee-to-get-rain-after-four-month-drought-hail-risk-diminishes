Coffee crops in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower, will receive adequate rain to flower properly in
coming days, alleviating concern that hailstorms could harm
trees after four months of drought, a forecaster said.  A cold front reached the southeastern states of Sao Paulo
and Minas Gerais on Sept. 26 and arrives in Espirito Santo state
tomorrow, said  Expedito Rebello , head of research at the
government’s Meteorology Institute, known as Inmet. The
likelihood that it will cause hailstorms fell to 10 percent from
a 60 percent probability estimated a week ago, he said.  “The rains will help the coffee harvest after all these
months of drought,” said Rebello in a telephone interview from
Brasilia today. “The weather will be very good for the
flowering of coffee trees from now on.”  Coffee trees in Brazil’s Southeast, which grows about 85
percent of the country’s output, need showers this time of the
year to flower properly before developing beans for the next
harvest. The region went through a 120-day drought, compared
with an annual average of 50 to 80 days in the past five
decades, Rebello said.  The area’s crops will receive about 50 millimeters (1.9
inches) of rain in coming days, Rebello said.  The state of Mato Grosso, which produces about 30 percent
of the country’s soybeans, will also get rains tomorrow, Rebello
said. Soybean growers have delayed planting to wait for rains,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
