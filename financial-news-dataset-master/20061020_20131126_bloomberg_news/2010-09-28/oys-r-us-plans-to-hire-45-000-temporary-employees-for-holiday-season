Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. , the world’s
biggest toy retailer, plans to hire about 45,000 employees to
cope with demand during the holiday season.  The move is “essentially doubling” the domestic workforce,
Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys ‘R’ Us said today in a statement.
About 10,000 of the positions will be available at the company’s
600 or so Toys ‘R’ Us Express temporary stores.  Chief Executive Officer  Gerald Storch  said this month that
he’s building more inventories than last year for the holidays,
typically the biggest shopping season for retailers. Consumers
have reduced spending as the U.S. economic recovery slows,
increasing competition among retailers.  Parents probably will seek lower-priced electronic toys for
the holidays as they strive to save money, according to Toy
Insider, the consumer-shopping guide released yesterday.
Toymakers are putting out fewer $200 to $300 toys, with most
costing one-fourth of that or less, according to Jonathan Samet,
the Toy Insider’s publisher.  U.S. toy sales amounted to $7.8 billion in the first half,
little changed from a year earlier, according to Port
Washington, New York-based researcher NPD Group Inc. In 2009,
toy sales fell by less than 1 percent to $21.5 billion, NPD
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
