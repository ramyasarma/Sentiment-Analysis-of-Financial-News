Corpbanca , Chile’s fifth largest
lender by assets, surged the most in almost two years on
speculation that  Banco do Brasil SA  may buy a non-controlling
stake through a capital increase.  Corpbanca rose 4.5 percent to 7.68 pesos at 12:02 p.m.,
after gaining 8.9 percent earlier, the largest increase since
Oct. 13, 2008. The  IPSA index  advanced 0.3 percent to 4,790.12.  Banco do Brasil, Latin America’s largest bank by assets,
has held informal talks to form a potential partnership with
Corpbanca,  Diario Financiero  reported. The Saieh family, which
owns Corpbanca, doesn’t plan to lose control of the bank in a
transaction, the Santiago-based financial newspaper reported,
citing unnamed sources at the Chilean bank.  “A partnership with Banco do Brasil would certainly be
positive for Corpbanca,”  Juan Pablo Correa , an analyst at IM
Trust SA Corredora de Bolsa, said today in a telephone interview
from Santiago. “A capital increase would give Corpbanca a much
stronger financial position and would provide a cheaper source
of funding.”  Daniel Gomez, an external public relations adviser for
Corpbanca at firm Imaginaccion Consultores, wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
