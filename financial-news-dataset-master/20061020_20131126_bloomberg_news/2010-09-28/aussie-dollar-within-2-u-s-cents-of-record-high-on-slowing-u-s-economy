The Australian dollar traded within
2 U.S. cents of a record high before a report forecast to show
U.S. business activity slowed, adding to evidence the Federal
Reserve may expand stimulus measures.  The Aussie is set for its biggest monthly gain since May
2009 as traders bet the Reserve Bank of Australia will increase
benchmark interest rates when it meets next week. New Zealand’s
dollar maintained three days of gains as Fed Bank of Atlanta
President Dennis Lockhart said yesterday the debate over whether
a new round of asset purchases should be undertaken will
“intensify” soon, and officials have the “will to act.”  “The U.S. dollar is going to stay weak with the rhetoric
coming out of the Fed,” said  Jim Vrondas , a manager at the
online foreign-exchange dealer OzForex Ltd. in Sydney. With
“the RBA resuming another round of tightening this year and
into next year, the Aussie dollar will have a pretty good go at
that parity level.”  Australia’s currency reached 97.06 U.S. cents, the most
since July 2008, and traded at 97.05 cents as of 4:52 p.m. in
Sydney from 96.76 cents in New York yesterday. It has gained 8.9
percent this month and 15 percent since June 30. The currency
traded at 81.03 yen from 81.15.  New Zealand’s dollar bought 73.93 U.S. cents from 73.94
cents yesterday, set for an 8 percent advance in the third
quarter and a 2.3 percent gain since the start of the year. It
fell 0.5 percent to 61.75 yen.  The Australian dollar reached 98.50 cents on July 15, 2008,
the most since it started trading freely in 1983.  Interest Rates  Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3
percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan  and
as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the South
Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades
is that currency market moves will erase profits.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will raise borrowing costs to
4.75 percent on Oct. 5, according to the median  estimate  of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. will say
tomorrow its business barometer fell to 55.7 this month, the
lowest since November, from 56.7 in August, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Figures
greater than 50 signal expansion.  N.Z. Gains Capped  Gains in the New Zealand dollar were capped after the
nation’s trade  deficit  widened in August as exports fell to a
nine-month low, led by milk, butter and meat shipments and lower
prices. The shortfall was NZ$437 million ($323 million) from a
revised NZ$183 million in July, Statistics New Zealand said
today. Exports fell 12 percent from July to NZ$3.15 billion.  “This release adds to the body of evidence that will keep
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on hold for some time,”  Roland Randall , an analyst at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Singapore, wrote
in a research note.  Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard will
increase the key rate by 50 basis points over the next year,
according to a Credit Suisse AG  index  based on swaps trading.
That’s down from 65 basis points on Sept. 20.  Australian bond futures rose, with the 10-year contract for
December delivery at 94.925 on the Sydney Futures Exchange from
94.91 yesterday. The implied yield stood at 5.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
