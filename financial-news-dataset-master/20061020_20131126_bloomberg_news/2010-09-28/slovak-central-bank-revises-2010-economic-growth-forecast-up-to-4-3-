The Slovak economy will probably
grow 4.3 percent this year, the central bank said, revising up
its previous forecast for expansion of 3.7 percent as foreign
demand has accelerated.  Spending cuts planned for next year will probably cause
 growth  to slow to 3 percent in 2011, compared with a rate of
4.3 percent predicted three months ago, the Bratislava,
Slovakia-based central bank said today. The expansion will then
accelerate to 4.1 percent in 2012 as domestic demand is set to
revive, the bank said, revising the forecast of 4.4 percent made
in June.  The recovery in Western Europe that fuels demand for
exports including cars assembled in Slovakia by Volkswagen AG is
helping the country grow faster than previously thought this
year. Still, the expansion in the east European euro-area member
is set to slow next year because of austerity measures aimed at
cutting the budget deficit from to 4.9 percent of gross domestic
product from an expected rate of 7.8 percent this year.  The government’s austerity plans represent the main risk to
the growth forecast, Governor  Jozef Makuch , who is also a member
of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, told
journalists today.  The central bank estimates an average  inflation  rate of 0.9
percent this year, compared with a June projection of 0.8
percent.  In 2011 and 2012, average inflation is set to increase
to 3.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively, compared with
earlier forecasts of 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent for the two
years.  Inflation will pick up in 2011 because of higher value-
added and excise taxes as well as commodities, the central bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
