Sawai Pharmaceutical Co. may extend
the response period for its proposed takeover of Kyorin Holdings
Inc. beyond Sept. 30, Nikkei English News reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.  Sawai is continuing negotiations with Kyorin, aiming for a
friendly takeover bid, Nikkei reported. Kyorin’s founding
family, which owns more than 40 percent of the stock, may not
want to sell, Nikkei reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
