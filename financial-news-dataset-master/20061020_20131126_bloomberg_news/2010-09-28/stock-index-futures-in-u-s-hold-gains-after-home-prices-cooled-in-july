U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after a gauge of home prices increased from last year at a
slower pace in July.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
to 1,141.5 at 9:04 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures climbed 0.3 percent to 10,783.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased 3.2
percent from July 2009, the smallest year-over-year gain since
March, the group said today in New York. The gauge is a three-
month average, which means the July data are still being
influenced by transactions in May and June that may have
benefitted from the government homebuyer incentive.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
