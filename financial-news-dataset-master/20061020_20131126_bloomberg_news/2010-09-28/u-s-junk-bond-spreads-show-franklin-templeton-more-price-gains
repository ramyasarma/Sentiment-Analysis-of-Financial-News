U.S. junk bonds’ relative yields
may tighten by as much as 100 basis points as corporate default
rates decline, pushing up prices for the debt, according to
Franklin Templeton Investments.  “Default rates have come down dramatically yet spreads
relative to government bonds are around 650 to 700 basis points
higher,”  Eric Takaha , a director of corporate and high-yield
for Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group, which manages $234
billion in assets, said in a phone interview from San Mateo,
California. Spreads averaged 600 basis points over the past 25
years, showing “some price appreciation” is likely, he said.  Average prices on high-yield debt rose above 100 cents on
the dollar on Sept. 16 for the first time since June 2007 after
falling as low as 55 cents in December 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Junk debt sales climbed to $191
billion this year versus $163 billion in all of 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of U.S. companies at greatest risk of default
dropped to the lowest in two years as Federal Reserve stimulus
efforts bolstered the economy, Moody’s Investors Service said in
a Sept. 22 report. Both high-yield and high-grade companies will
be able to refinance debt maturing through 2012 as long as the
economic recovery continues, even if it is sluggish, Moody’s
analysts led by  Kevin Cassidy  said in a separate study.  Price Appreciation  Junk, speculative-grade or high-yield debt is rated Ba1 and
below by Moody’s or BB+ and lower by Standard & Poor’s. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  While junk bonds prices won’t rise at the same pace as over
the past 18 months, “if you can clip an 8 percent coupon plus
get a little bit of price appreciation that’s not a bad return
versus most other asset classes,” Takaha said.  Attractive bonds include those of  Chesapeake Energy Corp .,
the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, and hospital
operator  HCA Inc ., he said. HCA, which was bought four years ago
in a $33 billion leveraged buyout led by KKR & Co. and Bain
Capital LLC, in May filed to sell shares worth as much as $4.6
billion through an initial public offering.  HCA, based in Nashville, Tennessee, has $1 billion of 6.5
percent notes due in 2016, Bloomberg data show. The bonds last
traded at 99.48 cents on the dollar, rising from 91.88 cents on
June 16, according to Interactive Brokers Group Inc. prices.  Energy Mergers  Chesapeake, based in Oklahoma City and rated BB by S&P,
sold $600 million of 6.875 percent bonds due 2018 at par last
month, the data show. While the company’s shares declined 16
percent this year, the notes rose to 104.44 cents on the dollar
today to yield 6.153 percent, according to Interactive Brokers.  “The idea with energy is that even though from an equity
standpoint you’ve seen some weakness, from a credit standpoint
merger and acquisition activity will benefit a lot of the high-
yield issuers,” Takaha said. “Over all our corporate
portfolios energy would be the largest weighting.”  Franklin Resources Inc . manages the Franklin and Templeton
mutual funds. In July it said fiscal third-quarter earnings rose
21 percent as deposits in its global bond fund ranked second
behind  Bill Gross’s  Pimco Total Return Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
