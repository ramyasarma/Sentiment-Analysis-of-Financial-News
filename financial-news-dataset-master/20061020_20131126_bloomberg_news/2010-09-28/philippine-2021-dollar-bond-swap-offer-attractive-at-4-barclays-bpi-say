The Philippines will probably set a
yield higher than 4 percent on its new January 2021 dollar
bonds, attractive enough for investors to consider an exchange,
according to Barclays Capital and BPI Asset Management.  The rate may be as much as 4.125 percent, said  Yvette Marquez , who helps manage the equivalent of $11 billion at BPI
Asset in Manila. The government is offering a twin exchange
program under which select bonds maturing between 2011 and 2017
can be swapped for debt maturing either in 2021 or 2034. Bonds
falling due between 2019 and 2031 can be swapped for securities
that mature in 2034.  The government offered to pay an indicative spread of at
least 155 basis points, or 1.55 percentage points, more than the
equivalent interest-rate swaps on the new 10-year securities. It
indicated a difference of at least 160 basis points over the
4.375 percent U.S. government debt due May 2040 for investors
who opt for the notes due October 2034, according to a statement
today. The spreads are indicative because they may change when
the bonds are sold tomorrow, the government said.  “Pricing on both legs of the exchange is favorable,”
 Krishna Hegde , a Singapore-based Asia credit strategist at
Barclays Capital, said by phone today, confirming a note by the
bank. “We find the pricing on the 2021s to be more
attractive.”  The existing 24-year dollar bond may be offered at 5.25
percent to 5.375 percent, BPI Asset’s Marquez said.  ‘$3 Billion Exchange’  There is “very good” demand for the ongoing dollar bond
exchange, Treasurer Roberto Tan said today. President  Benigno Aquino , who took office on June 30, is seeking to fix the
nation’s finances in part by tapping new sources of funds and
stretching the average maturity of its debt. The  budget  has been
in deficit for 21 of the last 25 years and the shortfall is
projected to widen to 325 billion pesos ($7.4 billion) in 2010
from 298.5 billion pesos last year.  “The size of the exchange can hit $3 billion or near
that,” Marquez said. “If that happens and they raise
sufficient fresh funds, they can afford to delay their overseas
fund-raising for 2011 a bit instead of doing the usual start-of-
the-year dollar offering.”  The government has $22.47 billion of dollar debt maturing
between 2011 and 2034, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
About $2.5 billion falls due in 2019, the most in any single
year. Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and UBS AG are joint
managers for the exchange that will end at 5 p.m. on Sept. 28,
New York time. About $17.7 billion of bonds qualify for the
exchange, the government said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
