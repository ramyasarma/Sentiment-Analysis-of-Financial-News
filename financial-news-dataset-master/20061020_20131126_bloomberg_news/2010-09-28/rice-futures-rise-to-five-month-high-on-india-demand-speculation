Rice climbed to the highest price
in almost five months on speculation that demand will increase
in India, the second-biggest consumer.  The country will extend a policy that allows tax-free
imports of the grain until Jan. 31, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar 
said today. The government will also continue a ban on exports
of non-basmati rice, Trade Minister  Anand Sharma  told reporters.
The commodity is up 11 percent this month.  “The news that India is going to allow duty-free imports,
that produced some buying this morning,” said  Jack Scoville , a
vice president at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.  Rice futures for November delivery were little changed,
closing down 0.5 cent to $12.56 per hundred pounds at 1:15 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Earlier, the price touched $12.64, the highest level for a
most-active contract since May 3. The grain has gained 30
percent since the end of June, partly because floods in Pakistan
curbed production.  China is the largest rice consumer and producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
