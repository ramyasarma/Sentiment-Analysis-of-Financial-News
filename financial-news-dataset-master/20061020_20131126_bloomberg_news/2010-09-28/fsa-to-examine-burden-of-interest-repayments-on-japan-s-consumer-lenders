Japan’s Financial Services Agency
will examine the burden on consumer lenders stemming from their
repayment of overcharged interest, the head of the regulator
said after reports Takefuji Corp. will go bankrupt.  “Consumer lenders’ business environment is in general very
severe, and at the same time they play a vital role with about
15 million healthy borrowers,” Financial Services Minister
 Shozaburo Jimi  said at a news conference today in Tokyo.  Takefuji, Japan’s third-biggest consumer lender, will file
for bankruptcy today after being forced to refund borrowers for
overcharged interest following a government clampdown, said a
person with direct knowledge of the matter. The industry has
faced 4.4 trillion yen ($52 billion) in costs following a 2006
Supreme Court ruling that lenders charged excessive interest
rates and a subsequent law change restricting credit costs.  “The industry has a future,” Jimi said. “Our follow-up
team will move ahead with discussions,” he added, without
elaborating. Jimi declined to comment on Takefuji’s proposed
bankruptcy filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
