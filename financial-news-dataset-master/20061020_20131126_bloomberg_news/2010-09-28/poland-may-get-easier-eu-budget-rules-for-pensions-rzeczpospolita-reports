The European Union’s new budget
rules will include a partial exemption for countries like Poland
that have revamped their pension systems, Rzeczpospolita
reported on its rp.pl website, citing an unnamed official at the
European Commission.  While contributions to privately managed pension funds will
be included in debt and budget deficit totals for EU members,
they will be partially deducted when the European Commission
considers whether to apply sanctions to countries whose deficits
exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product, the newspaper cited
the official as saying.  Poland pays from 1.5 percent to 2 percent of GDP annually
into the privately managed pension system, Rzeczpospolita said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
