Wheat stockpiles in bulk storage in
Australia, the fourth-largest exporter, dropped 15 percent last
month as demand rose after drought halted shipments from Russia.  Volumes in storage fell to 6.7 million metric tons at the
end of August, from 7.9 million tons in July, according to data
on the Australian Bureau of Statistics website today. The level
in August last year was 4.5 million tons, the bureau said.  The Australian government’s commodity forecaster this month
raised its wheat export estimate by about 3 percent for the year
ending Sept. 30 and predicted shipments could rise 21 percent to
the second-highest on record next marketing year. Exports may
continue at high levels after jumping in July as drought reduced
supply from Black Sea region countries, CBH Group, Western
Australia’s largest grain handler, said Sept. 7.  “Stocks of wheat stored by bulk-grain handlers decreased
in all states in August,” the Australian Bureau of Statistics
said today. Milling wheat comprised 89 percent of the stockpiles
and the remainder was feed grade, it said.  Wheat for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.05 a
bushel on Chicago Board of Trade at 2:17 p.m. Melbourne time,
trimming this year’s advance to 30 percent.  Russia in early August said it was banning grain exports as
the country’s worst drought in half a century destroyed crops,
boosting demand for supplies from alternative sources.  Australian wheat shipments for the year to Sept. 30 may
reach 15.2 million tons, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural &
Resource Economics-Bureau of Rural Sciences said in a report
Sept. 14. That was up from its June estimate of 14.8 million
tons. Shipments may reach 18.4 million tons next year, it said.  The country’s wheat stockpiles may be 4.59 million tons at
the end of the 2009-2010 marketing year, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecast Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
