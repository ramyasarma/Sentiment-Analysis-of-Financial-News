The Spanish government’s two-month
amnesty for solar power plants which claimed the highest rate of
subsidy illegally has seen few developers admit to wrongdoing,
Expansion reported, citing people in the industry without
identifying them.   Solar operators who are found to have cheated after the
Oct. 6 deadline may face criminal charges, the newspaper added.  The government is trying to reduce the subsidies paid to
renewable power producers. Officials are attempting to weed out
fraud before deciding whether to cut the fixed price that
photovoltaic plants earn.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
