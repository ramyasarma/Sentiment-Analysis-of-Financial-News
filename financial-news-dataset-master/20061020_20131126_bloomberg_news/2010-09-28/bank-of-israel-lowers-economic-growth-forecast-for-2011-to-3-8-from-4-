The Bank of Israel lowered its 2011
economic growth forecast to 3.8 percent from the 4 percent it
had predicted in April on slowing exports.  Export expansion is expected to ease as growth slows in the
U.S., one of Israel’s key markets, the bank said in a statement
released on its website today.  The central bank yesterday raised its  benchmark interest
rate  by a quarter-point to 2 percent and forecast inflation of
2.5 percent over the next 12 months. It also yesterday raised
its growth forecast for 2010 to 4 percent from 3.7 percent and
said economic indicators pointed to a “continued rapid
expansion” in the third quarter.  The bank today forecast an  unemployment rate  of 6.3 percent
in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011, which would bring joblessness
back to levels before the global financial crisis began two
years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
