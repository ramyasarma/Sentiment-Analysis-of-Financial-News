Peru’s central bank is the most
“aggressive” in the region in damping gains in the local
currency and along with Colombia the country has the highest
risk of imposing capital controls, according to Goldman Sachs.  Chile and Colombia are the most “friendly” towards
appreciation, Goldman said in a report. Brazil’s
“intervention” in the currency market “dwarfs” the rest of
the region, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
