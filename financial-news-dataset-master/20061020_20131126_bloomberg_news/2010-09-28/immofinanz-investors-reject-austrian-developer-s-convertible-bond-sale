     Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) --  Immofinanz AG  shareholders rejected
a plan to give Austria’s biggest property developer the option
of selling  bonds  convertible into as many as 229.5 million
shares, or 22 percent of the company’s outstanding stock.  The measure required 75 percent approval at today’s
shareholder meeting in Vienna to pass. It received 48 percent of
votes, Chairman  Herbert Kofler  said.  The resolution was voted down even after Immofinanz earlier
today reduced the number of shares involved to 229.5 million
from 310 million, or 30 percent of outstanding stock. Immofinanz
cut the number after management learned that some  institutional
investors  would vote against it on concerns that the company
would make use of it “to the extreme,” Chief Executive Officer
 Eduard Zehetner  said earlier today.  Immofinanz had been aiming to actually sell bonds
convertible into about 150 million to 200 million shares,
Zehetner said.  Zehetner said before the vote that if it were rejected, the
company may need to carry out a share sale to refinance 810
million euros ($1.1 billion) of convertible bonds due 2014 and
2017 that investors can redeem in 2012. Another option would be
the sale of some properties, he said.  Unlike a convertible bond, shares would be sold at market
value, leading to a “dramatic dilution,” Zehetner said.
Immofinanz is authorized to sell 229.5 million shares, according
to a 2009 shareholder resolution. Investors today also rejected
a resolution that would have allowed management to sell as many
as 300 million shares. The company earlier lowered the total
from 500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
