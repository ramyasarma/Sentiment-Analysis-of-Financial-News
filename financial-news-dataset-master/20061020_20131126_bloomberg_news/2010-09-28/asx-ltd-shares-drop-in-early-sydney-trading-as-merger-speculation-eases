ASX Ltd.  shares dropped in Sydney
trading as speculation eased that Australia’s main stock
exchange operator is close to a tie-up with local or foreign
counterparts.  ASX  shares  fell 0.8 percent to A$33.52 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trading on the Australian stock exchange in Sydney,
retreating from yesterday’s five-month-high close and ending
seven straight days of gains. It was the biggest decline since
Sept. 2 for ASX shares, which have lost 4.1 percent since the
start of the year.  ASX faces competition from companies such as Chi-X Global
Inc., an electronic-trading-platform that won preliminary
approval this year to become Australia’s first rival to the
dominant exchange operator.  ASX said in a statement today that talks with a small
number of exchange groups over possible tie-ups hadn’t resulted
in a disclosable transaction proposal.  “We haven’t heard anything concrete,” said  Angus Gluskie ,
who manages about $300 million at White Funds Management Pty in
Sydney. “It has the potential to be positive for ASX if a
joint-venture structure was developed as it reduces the
competitive threat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
