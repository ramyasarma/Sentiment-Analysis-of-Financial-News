Indian stocks fell for the first
time in three days, led by metal producers, as raw material
prices retreated amid concern the recent rally may be overdone.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer,
tracked metals prices lower as concern mounted that demand may
falter if European government finances worsen.  Housing
Development Finance Corp. , the largest mortgage lender, dropped
for the second day, paring its monthly gain to 14 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 78.98, or 0.4 percent, to 20,038.40 at 1:38 p.m. in Mumbai,
after swinging between gains and losses at least 14 times. The
measure has climbed 12 percent this month to its highest level
in 2 1/2 years and is the best performer among the world’s 10
largest benchmark stock indexes.  “Investors are becoming skeptical,” said  Arun Kejriwal ,
the Mumbai-based director of Kejriwal Research & Investment
Services Pvt. “Valuations are a concern. The weakness in
overseas markets is not helping, either.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.6 percent to 5,998.10. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.5
percent to 2,530.31.  Hindalco, Sterlite  Hindalco fell 2 percent to 193 rupees.  Sterlite Industries

1.1 percent to 175.9 rupees.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six industrial metals,
including aluminum and copper, lost 0.6 percent yesterday, its
first decline in four days. Revived concern that European
government debt will hurt global economic growth contributed to
a decline in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  of stocks today.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services provider, lost 0.8 percent to 3,010 rupees, while
larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. dropped 1 percent to
918 rupees. Wipro Ltd., the third biggest, decreased 0.9 percent
to 440.65 rupees. India’s software exporters get about a quarter
of their sales from Europe.  Housing Development lost 2.3 percent to 715 rupees. The
shares are trading at 31 times estimated earnings compared with
19 times for the Sensex.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 49
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  13.4 billion rupees  ($294
million) of Indian equities on Sept. 24, taking total
investments in the stocks this year to 821.6 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.

triggering a record annual decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
