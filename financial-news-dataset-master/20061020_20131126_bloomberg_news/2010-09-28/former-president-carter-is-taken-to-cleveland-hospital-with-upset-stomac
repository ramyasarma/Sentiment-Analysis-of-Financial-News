Former President  Jimmy Carter 
“sounded great” in a telephone call with President  Barack Obama  and is ready to resume his book tour tomorrow,  Bill Burton , a White House spokesman, said.  Obama called Carter, who was hospitalized in Cleveland,
from Air Force One after leaving an event in New Mexico.  Carter, 85, the 39th U.S. president, was taken to a
hospital in Cleveland today and treated for what his office said
was an upset stomach.  Carter’s spokeswoman, Deanna Congileo, said in a statement
that the former president will remain at Metro Health Hospital
in Cleveland overnight on his doctor’s recommendation.  Carter became ill while on a flight to Cleveland, where he
was scheduled to appear at a bookstore this afternoon to discuss
his book, “White House Diary.” He is set to resume the tour
tomorrow in Washington, according to Congileo’s statement.  Obama was informed of Carter’s hospitalization while at a
stop in New Mexico, where he was starting a four-state trip to
talk about the economy and the November elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
