(Corrects third paragraph to restate weather in the
Northeast.)  Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in three days on speculation that warmer weather will
boost demand for the power-plant fuel.  Above-normal temperatures are likely in the western half
of the U.S. and the Northeast through Oct. 2, according to MDA
Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.
The high in New York on Oct. 1 may be 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23
Celsius), four degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather.com  “We’re seeing some immediately warmer temperatures in the
West, cooler in the Northeast,” said  Matt Smith , an analyst
with Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky. “After today, we’ll
probably start at the $4 level again and kick around there as we
trend along to the end of the hurricane season.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 2.1 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.821 per million British thermal units at 9:20
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have fallen 31
percent this year.  The October contract expires today. November futures rose
3.6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.952.  About 23 percent of U.S. electricity is generated using
natural gas, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
