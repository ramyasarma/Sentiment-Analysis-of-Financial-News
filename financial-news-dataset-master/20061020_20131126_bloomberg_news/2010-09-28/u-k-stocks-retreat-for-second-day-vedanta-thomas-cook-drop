The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  was
little changed after a late  rally  in mining companies offset a
worse-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence report.  Xstrata Plc, the world’s fourth-largest copper producer,
Antofagasta Plc and Rio Tinto Plc all rebound with copper
prices. Sage Group Plc jumped 5.1 percent amid reports the
company may be a takeover target.  Man Group Plc  led declining
shares after the hedge fund manager forecast first-half profit
will drop by more than 55 percent.  The  FTSE 100  rose 5.02, or 0.1 percent, to 5,578.44 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also gained
0.1 percent. Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  fell 0.8 percent as the cost
of insuring against default on the country’s government debt
surged to a record.  “It’s been a  roller coaster  of a ride today with a bit of
volatility returning to the market,” said London-based  Angus Campbell , head of sales at Capital Spreads. “The attraction of
undervalued and high yielding equities is too much of a
temptation to sell out completely.”  The benchmark FTSE 100 fell as much as 1.2 percent earlier
today amid continued concern about the creditworthiness of
Europe’s most indebted nations and as U.S. consumer confidence
fell in September to the lowest level in seven months.  Xstrata, Rio Tinto  Xstrata rallied 2.3 percent to 1,249 pence after copper
prices rose for the fourth time in five sessions as inventories
fell and a weaker U.S. dollar boosted demand.  Antofagasta, owner of copper mines in Chile, gained 2.1
percent to 1,220 pence. Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest
mining company, increased 1.3 percent to 3,751 pence.
      Sage  rallied 5.1 percent to 280 pence after the Daily Mail
reported that Germany’s SAP AG or Microsoft Corp. may be mulling
a bid for the U.K. software company. Analysts at UBS AG said the
speculation was unlikely given SAP’s recent $5.8 billion
acquisition of Sybase Inc. in July and Microsoft’s strategic
emphasis on the search and mobile business.
      Man Group  dropped 2.4 percent to 214.1 pence after the
company said it expects first-half profit to drop as income from
management and performance fees declines.  Pretax profit will be about $135 million for the six months
to Sept. 30 compared with $302 million in the year-earlier
period. Investors also withdrew $600 million from the London-
based firm in the fiscal second quarter while performance fees
dropped 79 percent.  Bank of Ireland  Plc paced the retreat in Irish equities,
dropping 7.4 percent to 53.5 euro cents in Dublin trading.
 Allied Irish Banks Plc  lost 5.7 percent to 50 euro cents, while
Irish Life & Permanent Plc fell 2.9 percent to 1.36 euros.  Credit Default Swaps  The cost of insuring against default on the nation’s debt
surged to a record as Standard & Poor’s said the price of
bailing out nationalized lender  Anglo Irish Bank Corp . could
exceed $47 billion.  Credit-default swaps tied to Irish bonds jumped as much as
30.5 basis points to 521.5 after more than doubling in the past
two months, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Anglo
Irish rose 4 basis points from yesterday’s record high closing
price to 940, implying a 56 percent probability of default
within five years.  Elsewhere,  Thomas Cook Group Plc  lost 6.3 percent to 171.7
pence in London trading. Europe’s second-biggest tour operator
said higher costs in the U.K. will reduce operating profit by
about 10 million pounds ($15.8 million). The company, which
reiterated that trading in the U.K. business over the summer was
weaker than expected, said it is aiming for “substantial” cost
savings to help offset an “uncertain” economic backdrop.  Shares of larger rival TUI Travel Plc fell 1.3 percent to
218.5 pence.  JJB Sports Plc  slumped 15 percent to 9.4 pence, the lowest
level since March 2009, after the U.K. retailer said it had
increased promotions following “more volatile” sales since the
beginning of August.  The company’s operating loss in the six months to Aug. 1
narrowed to 24.6 million pounds from 41.9 million pounds a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
