Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s Fininvest SpA may settle a legal case with the De
Benedetti family’s Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA for between
300 million euros and 350 million euros, MF reported.  Fininvest was ordered by a Milan court in October to pay
CIR 750 million euros in damages for bribing a judge during a
takeover battle for publisher Arnoldo Mondadori SpA. CIR later
agreed to a suspension of the payment based on a bank guarantee
to be paid if Fininvest lost on appeal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
