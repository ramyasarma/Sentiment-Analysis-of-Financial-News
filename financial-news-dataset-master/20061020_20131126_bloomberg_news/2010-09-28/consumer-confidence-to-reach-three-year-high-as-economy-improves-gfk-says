German consumer confidence will
climb to a three-year high in October as the stronger economy
and falling unemployment boost income expectations, according to
GfK AG.  The Nuremberg-based market research company said today that
its  consumer sentiment index , based on a survey of about 2,000
people, will rise to 4.9 from a revised 4.3 in September. That
would be the highest since October 2007. Economists forecast a
gain to 4.2 from the initial September reading of 4.1, the
median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey  shows.  German  unemployment  declined for a 14th month in August
after surging exports and investment fueled record economic
expansion in the second quarter. Even as growth slows in the
second half of the year, the Federal Labor Agency’s IAB research
institute said this month it expects unemployment to drop below
3 million people in 2011 to a nine-year low.  “The economic upturn is driving consumer expectations of
an improvement in their financial situation,” GfK said in a
statement. “But the decisive factor for the strong sentiment
among consumers is the extremely positive development of the
employment market.”  The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent last month.  GfK’s measure of households’ economic expectations jumped
to 53.5 in September from 46.6 in August. A gauge of income
expectations increased to 45.2 from 36, while an index of
consumers’ willingness to spend rose to 30.7 from 27.9.  German retail sales will increase about 1.5 percent this
year, the HDE industry group said on Sept. 23, raising its
forecast from zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
