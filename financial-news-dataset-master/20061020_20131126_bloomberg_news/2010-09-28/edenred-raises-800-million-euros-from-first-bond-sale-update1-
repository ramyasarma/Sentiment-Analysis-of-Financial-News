Edenred , the producer of prepaid
service vouchers, raised 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) from
its first sale of bonds, according to a banker involved in the
transaction.  The seven-year notes were priced to yield 140 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, said the banker, who declined
to be identified before a public announcement. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The Paris-based company, which split from hotel group Accor
SA in July, is selling bonds because of favorable market
conditions, said an Edenred spokeswoman who declined to be
named. Relative yields on European investment-grade company debt
have shrunk to 134 basis points over swaps, down from this
year’s peak of 161 in June, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show.  Edenred’s notes offer “decent value,” said  Maureen Schuller , senior credit strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.  The bonds will be rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s, the
second-lowest investment-grade ranking, and one step below the
company’s rating. The proceeds from the sale may be used to
repay debt including a 600 million-euro syndicated loan, S&P
said in a statement.  Deutsche Bank AG, Natixis and Societe Generale SA are
managing the sale, the banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
