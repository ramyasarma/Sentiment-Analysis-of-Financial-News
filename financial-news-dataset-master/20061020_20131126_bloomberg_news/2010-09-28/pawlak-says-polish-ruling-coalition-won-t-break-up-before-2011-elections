The junior partner in Poland’s
ruling coalition has no intention of leaving the alliance before
parliamentary elections next year, said the head of the Polish
Peasants Party and Deputy Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak .  “I can’t see any reasons for pessimism over the ruling
coalition’s future,” Pawlak, who is also economy minister, said
in an interview in Warsaw yesterday. “Nothing is set in stone
in politics but for the time being the Polish Peasants Party
focuses on the positive effects of cooperation with the Civic
Platform as we believe it is worth continuing.”  Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform formed a
coalition with the Peasants party in October 2007. The two
parties clashed in June over the nomination of  Marek Belka  as
governor of the central bank. Pawlak opposed the appointment by
then Acting President  Bronislaw Komorowski , arguing the governor
should take his mandate from an elected president. Former head
of state Lech Kaczynski died in an April plane crash.  The conflict over Belka sparked speculation about a
possible collapse of the coalition. Tusk  said a week ago that
Civic Platform party may form a coalition with the opposition
Democratic Left Alliance after the parliamentary elections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
