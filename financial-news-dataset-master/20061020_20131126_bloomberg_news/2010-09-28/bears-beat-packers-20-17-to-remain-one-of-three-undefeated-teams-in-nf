The Chicago Bears defeated the
Green Bay Packers 20-17 in a matchup of unbeaten division rivals
as  Robbie Gould  kicked a 19-yard field goal with five seconds
remaining at Soldier Field.  The winning score came after  Brian Urlacher  forced a fumble
at the Packers’ 46-yard line with 2:18 left.  Green Bay finished with a 379-276 advantage in total
offensive yards in Chicago, yet had a field goal get blocked,
committed two turnovers and tied a 55-year-old franchise record
with 17 penalties for 152 yards.  The Bears join the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City
Chiefs as the National Football League’s only 3-0 teams. The
lone unbeaten team in the National Football Conference, Chicago
next visits the New York Giants on Oct. 3.  After the Packers took a 10-0 lead last night, Chicago’s
 Jay Cutler  threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to  Greg Olsen  26
seconds before halftime. The score remained 10-7 until  Devin Hester ’s 62-yard punt return put Chicago 14-10 ahead 21 seconds
into the fourth quarter.  Aaron Rodgers  scored on a three-yard run with 6:52 left to
give the Packers a 17-14 lead before Gould booted two field
goals in the final four minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
