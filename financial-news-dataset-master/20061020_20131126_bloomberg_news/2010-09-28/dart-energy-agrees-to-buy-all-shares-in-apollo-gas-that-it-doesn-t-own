Apollo Gas Ltd.  surged the most in
nine months after Dart Energy Ltd. agreed to acquire the 79
percent of the Australian coal-seam gas explorer it doesn’t
already own to take control of permits in New South Wales state.  Apollo  rose  30 percent to settle at 79 Australian cents at
4:10 p.m. in Sydney, the biggest gain since Dec. 15, valuing the
company at A$158 million ($152 million). Dart climbed 4.8
percent to A$1.10, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.1 percent.  Dart, which already owns 21 percent of the gas explorer,
offered 3 of its shares for every 4 Apollo shares, the Brisbane-
based company said in a statement today. The bid has been
recommended by Apollo’s independent directors, said Dart, which
holds assets in Australia, China, Indonesia, India and Vietnam.  “This begins our realization of the strategy in Australia
to grow big, and grow fast,” Dart Chief Executive Officer,
 Simon Potter , said on a conference call with investors. The deal
enhances the potential option to spin off the international
assets through an initial public offer, Potter said.  Dart was spun off from Arrow Energy Ltd., which agreed in
March to sell its Australian business to Royal Dutch Shell Plc
and PetroChina Co. for A$3.5 billion. Apollo’s New South Wale’s
permits may start producing gas for the domestic market by 2012,
Potter told reporters on a separate conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
