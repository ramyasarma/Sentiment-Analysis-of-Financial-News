(Corrects to say deal is sold in headline, first
paragraph.)  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . sold $14.5
million of so-called range accrual notes linked to interbank
lending rates and the yen, which reached a 15-year high versus
the dollar this month.  The sale includes a $9.5 million portion with a 15-year
maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the first
five years, the notes pay an annualized return of 8.5 percent
each day the  six-month London interbank offered rate  is below
6.5 percent and the dollar is worth more than 80 yen. After five
years, the Libor limit increases to 7 percent.  Goldman Sachs also sold $5 million of 12-year notes that
pay a coupon of 7.2 percent if three-month Libor stays below 6.5
percent and the dollar is above 78 yen.  Both notes don’t pay any interest if Libor or the dollar
moves outside the notes’ ranges. The securities were issued at
100 percent of face value.  The yen rose 0.25 percent to 84.08 per dollar at 12:26 p.m.
in London. The Japanese currency strengthened to 82.88 on Sept.
15, its highest level against the dollar since May 1995.  Six-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks and
used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.463 percent, the lowest
since April 19. The rate was last above 6.5 percent in December
2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
