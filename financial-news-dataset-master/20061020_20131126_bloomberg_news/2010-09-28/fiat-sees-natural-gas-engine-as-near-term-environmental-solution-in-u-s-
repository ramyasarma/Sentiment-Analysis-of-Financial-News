Fiat SpA sees natural gas
propulsion as a “near-term environmental solution” also for
the U.S. as it has “less expensive production, transportation
and distribution” than hybrid and electric engines, according
to the slide presentation of a speech by Fiat’s executive
Alfredo Altavilla at a conference in Paris today.  The Italian carmaker, which acquired a 20 percent stake in
Chrysler Group LLC last year, sees a widespread use of hybrid
propulsion only after 2020, according to the slides posted on
company’s website. Fiat also said it’s ready for
“hybridification and electrification when cost-attractive for
costumers.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
