Aafia Siddiqui, the Pakistani
scientist sentenced to 86 years in prison for trying to kill
U.S. soldiers and agents in Afghanistan in 2008, filed a notice
of appeal.  Siddiqui will ask a federal appeals court to review her
conviction and sentence, according to the one-page notice filed
today by Siddiqui’s lawyer, Dawn Cardi, in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan.  Siddiqui was accused of grabbing a U.S. soldier’s rifle and
firing on soldiers and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents
after being detained in Ghazni, Afghanistan. She was convicted
after a two-week trial.  At her Sept. 23 sentencing, Siddiqui rejected the
possibility of an appeal and said she didn’t want the continued
assistance of her lawyers.  Yusill Scribner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office
in Manhattan, didn’t immediately return an e-mail message
seeking comment. Cardi didn’t immediately return a phone
message.  The case is U.S. v. Siddiqui, 08-cr-00826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
