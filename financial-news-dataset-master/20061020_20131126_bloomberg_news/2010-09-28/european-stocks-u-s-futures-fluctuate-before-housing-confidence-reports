European stocks and U.S. index
futures fluctuated before reports that may show American home-
price gains slowed and consumer confidence cooled.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.2 percent to 262.52
at 11:20 a.m. in London, having earlier risen as much as 0.2
percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December advanced 0.1 percent to 1,139.2.  The S&P 500 has surged 8.9 percent in September, heading
for the biggest monthly gain since April 2009, as signs of
improving demand for capital goods, technology products and
consumer items eased concern the economic rebound is slowing.
September is historically the worst month for the gauge, with
losses averaging 1.2 percent since 1928.  Property values in 20 U.S. cities increased 3.1 percent in
July from the same month last year, less than the 4.2 percent
gain in the 12 months to June, according to the median forecast
of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Home price data
from S&P/Case-Shiller are scheduled to be released at 9 a.m.
Washington time.  The Conference Board in New York will issue its consumer
confidence figure for September at 10 a.m. Forecasts of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged from 48 to 55, with a
median of 52.1, after an August reading of 53.5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
