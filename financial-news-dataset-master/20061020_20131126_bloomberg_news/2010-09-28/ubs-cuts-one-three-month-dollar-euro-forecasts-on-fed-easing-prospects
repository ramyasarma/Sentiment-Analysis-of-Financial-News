UBS AG reduced its short-term

Reserve will expand Treasury purchases to spur growth.  The U.S. currency will trade at $1.35 per euro in one month
from a previous estimate of $1.28, UBS said in a research note
dated yesterday. The dollar will be at $1.25 against the euro in
three months, from an earlier target of $1.15.  UBS also revised its three-month forecast for the Swiss
franc, expecting the currency to trade at 1.28 per euro from
1.30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
