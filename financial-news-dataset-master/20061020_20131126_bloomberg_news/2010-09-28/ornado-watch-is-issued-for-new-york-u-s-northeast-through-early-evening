A tornado watch has been issued for
New York City and much of the U.S. Northeast until at least 6
p.m., according to the National Weather Service.  The watch, meaning a tornado may form, covers southern New
York and western Long Island, western Connecticut and parts of
New Jersey, according to the weather service. Earlier today it
also included eastern Pennsylvania and western Massachusetts.  “Conditions are conducive for the formation of a tornado,
any of these showers or storms could, and the key word is could,
produce a tornado,” said David Stark, a weather service
meteorologist in  Upton, New York . “It is unusual, but you can
get severe weather at any time.”  Two tornadoes touched down in New York, including
Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood, Sept. 16. The storms were
blamed for killing a woman when a tree fell on her car. They
also created widespread power outages and disrupted commuter
trains on the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s  Long Island Rail
Road .  A tornado also struck the Bronx in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
