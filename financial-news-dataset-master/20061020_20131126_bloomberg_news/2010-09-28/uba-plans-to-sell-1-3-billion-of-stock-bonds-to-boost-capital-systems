(Corrects value of bonds sale in second paragraph of story
originally published yesterday.)  United Bank for Africa Plc ,
Nigeria’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, will sell
shares and bonds worth 200 billion naira ($1.3 billion) to boost
its capital and fund an upgrade of its computer systems.  A bond sale worth 35 billion naira, the first of a 400
billion-naira program over the next five years, will close
tomorrow, Financial Controller Ugochukwu Nwagbodoh said in an
interview in Lagos today. The bank also plans to raise 100
billion naira through a share sale, he said, without providing
further details.  UBA has expanded into African countries, including
Tanzania, where regulators are demanding lenders boost their
capital. “Tanzania has asked the banks to raise their capital
over the next three years,” he said. “We are having such
requests frequently,” Nwagbodoh said.  UBA is also exploring opportunities to expand into China
and the United Arab Emirates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
