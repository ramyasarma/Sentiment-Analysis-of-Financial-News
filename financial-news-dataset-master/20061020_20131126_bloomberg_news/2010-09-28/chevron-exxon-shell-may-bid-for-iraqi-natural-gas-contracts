Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp. ,
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and  OAO Gazprom  are among 13 companies
interested in bidding next month to develop natural-gas fields
in Iraq, said a senior member of the country’s parliament.  Among the other companies registered to bid are  Eni Spa ,
 Mitsubishi Corp.  and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the parliament’s oil and gas
committee, said in an interview in Istanbul today. The bidding
round for gas rights is planned for Oct. 20 in Baghdad.  “There is strong interest from the big majors, and this is
excellent,” Hassani said. “We care more about the fact that
big majors are interested, rather than in the number of
bidders.”  Preparations for bidding are proceeding well and according
to schedule, he said on the sidelines of a conference about
Iraq’s energy industry.  Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign
investors in all parts of its economy after years of conflict
and sanctions. The country held two licensing rounds last year
for oil and gas investments.  The third round will focus specifically on the Akkas,
Mansouriya and Siba gas fields, which Iraq is eager to develop
for domestic power generation as well as export revenue. The
three undeveloped fields hold combined gas reserves of more than
11 trillion cubic feet.  Iraq has the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and wants
to more than double its current crude production of 2.4 million
barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
