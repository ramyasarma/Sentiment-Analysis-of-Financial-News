The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia wants to join a pipeline planned by OAO Gazprom and
 Eni SpA’s (ENI)  that will carry Russian natural gas across the Black
Sea through  Bulgaria  to western Europe.  Macedonia’s government will meet with Gazprom officials in
the capital Skopje on Oct. 1 to discuss extending a leg of the
link to the Balkan nation of 2 million people, the country’s
 Finance Ministry  said today on its website.  Macedonia, along with  Romania  is seeking to join countries
including Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia and
 Serbia  as a partner in the onshore section of South Stream that
is scheduled to deliver gas by the end of 2015.  One section of the pipeline would terminate at  OMV (OMV)  AG’s
Baumgarten hub, currently the destination for about a third of
Russia’s gas exports to western Europe.  South Stream competes with the OMV-led Nabucco pipeline,
which aims to bring gas from the Caspian Sea region and the
Middle East to  Austria  via  Turkey  to reduce Europe’s reliance on
Russian supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
