Michigan  and  Florida  led 34 U.S.
states whose median household income fell in 2009, up from eight
with declines the year before, as the worst recession since the
Great Depression sapped Americans’ earnings.  Nationally, median household income fell 3 percent in 2009
to $50,221, the second straight annual drop, the  Census Bureau 
said in its  2009 American Community Survey . Income in Michigan
fell 6.2 percent to $45,255, while Florida followed with a drop
of 5.7 percent, to $44,736, the bureau said in a report on its
website.  The recession ended in June 2009, the National Bureau of
Economic Research said last week, even as a slowdown in economic
growth raises the prospects of another slump. The nation’s
jobless rate was 9.6 percent last month, more than double the
level of three years earlier.  The national recession “hammered the economy and engulfed
every state,” said  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s
Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “We’re light
years away from gaining jobs.”  North Dakota was the only state whose income rose in 2009.
The state’s median climbed 5.1 percent to $47,827, for the
eighth straight annual gain. Fifteen states and the District of
Columbia showed changes that were statistically insignificant,
the bureau said.  Recession and Deficits  The national recession choked tax collections and drove
deficits in 46 states to a total of $121 billion, or about a
fifth of their fiscal 2011 budgets, the Washington, D.C.-based
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a July report.  Guy LeBas , chief fixed-income strategist with Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, a financial-advisory firm,
said the decline in income is due to high unemployment and fewer
hours worked by people who have jobs.  “We expect this to continue for a number of years,” LeBas
said in an interview. “The only thing that’s going to generate
significant spending growth is significant income growth.”  Employers in Michigan cut 50,300 jobs last month, the
biggest drop since January 2009, figures from the Labor
Department showed. The state’s  unemployment rate  was 13.1
percent in August, the country’s second-highest after Nevada.
Florida’s  unemployment rate  was 11.7 percent last month.  Maryland  had the highest income for a fourth consecutive
year, at $69,272, even as its median dropped from $70,545 in
2008, the bureau said. The bureau noted that Maryland’s total
wasn’t statistically different from that of New Jersey and
Alaska.  Mississippi  had the lowest for at least the fifth
straight year, at $36,646. The bureau said Mississippi’s median
was statistically the same as West Virginia’s.  The American Community Survey data are used to help
determine the annual distribution of more than $400 billion in
federal and state funds, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
