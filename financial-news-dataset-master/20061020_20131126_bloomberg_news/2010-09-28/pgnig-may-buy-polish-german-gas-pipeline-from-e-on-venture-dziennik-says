(Corrects spelling of Bartimpex in first paragraph.)  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA, Poland’s dominant gas company known as PGNiG, is
interested in taking over a project to build a gas pipeline
linking Poland and Germany from a joint venture of E.ON Ruhrgas
AG and Bartimpex of Poland, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported,
citing Jan Antosik, a member of Bartimpex’s management board.  After the transaction, PGNiG would merge its own planned
pipeline to Germany with the acquired project, the Warsaw-based
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.
Both parties plan to meet within the next two weeks to agree on
the details of the deal, Dziennik reported.  Representatives of PGNiG declined to comment on the issue,
Dziennik said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
