Gasoline advanced as the dollar
weakened to a five-month low, increasing the investment lure of
dollar-denominated commodities, and after a report that U.S.
home prices rose in July.  Futures rose as the U.S. currency sank to the lowest
intraday level since April 16 after a report that U.S. consumer
confidence reached a seven-month low. The S&P/Case-Shiller index
of property values gained 3.2 percent from July 2009, the
smallest year-over-year gain since March.  “The contraction in the housing market seems to be
tapering off, which could act as a semi-support for the oil
market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The market is also
“following the ups and downs in equities and the dollar.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 2.29 cents, or 1.2

median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for
a decline to 52.1.  Manufacturing Slows  Manufacturing in the central Atlantic region pulled back in
September after expanding during the previous seven months,
according to the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.  “The fundamentals don’t matter,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas. “All the wealth of economic data was bad, but
more bad news is interpreted as good news for the market because
of the likely response of the Federal Reserve, to institute
another round of quantitative easing.”  Gasoline stockpiles probably rose 350,000 barrels last
