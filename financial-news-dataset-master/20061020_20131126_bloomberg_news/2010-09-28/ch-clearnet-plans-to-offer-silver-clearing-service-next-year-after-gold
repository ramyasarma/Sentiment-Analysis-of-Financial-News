LCH.Clearnet Ltd. said it plans to
offer a clearing service for trading silver over-the-counter
next year and should start clearing gold toward the end of
November.  The clearing house plans to offer the silver service some
time next year and then a platinum and palladium clearing
service after, David Farrar, a director and head of commodities
and metals commercial services at LCH.Clearnet, said yesterday
in an interview at a London Bullion Market Association
conference in Berlin. LCH.Clearnet and the London Metal Exchange
will offer clearing for gold contracts from spot up to 10 years
forward, he said.  “People want to continue trading in the OTC market and
we’re offering that while removing the counterparty risk,”
Farrar said. “We’ll have the infrastructure in place to do
gold, and silver can easily be added to this.”  Farrar was unable to say when the platinum and palladium
service may start.  To contact the reporter on this story:
