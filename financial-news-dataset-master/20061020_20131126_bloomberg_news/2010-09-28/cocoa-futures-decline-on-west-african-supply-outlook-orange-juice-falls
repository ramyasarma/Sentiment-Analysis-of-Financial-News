Cocoa futures fell for the first
time in four sessions amid signs of increased supplies from West
Africa, the world’s biggest producing region. Orange-juice also
dropped.  From Oct. 1 to Sept. 19, deliveries to ports in Ivory
Coast, the top grower, rose 2 percent from a year earlier,
according to the state-run Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao. Ghana,
the second-largest producer, plans to increase output. Prices
have dropped 14 percent this year.  “That crop looks pretty good” in Ivory Coast, said  Phil Streible , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago. “We’re going to start to roll back” because of the
outlook for higher supplies, and prices may fall to $2,600 a
metric ton in a couple of weeks, Streible said.  Cocoa for December delivery dropped $22, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $2,817 a ton at 11:58 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest decline since Sept. 20. The commodity gained
2.8 percent in the previous three sessions.  Output may exceed demand by 50,000 tons to 100,000 tons in
the season that starts next month, the  International Cocoa
Organization  has forecast. Ivory Coast deliveries this season
rose to 1.184 million tons from 1.161 million a year earlier,
the Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao said.  Ghana, Uganda  Ghana wants to increase production to 1 million tons by the
season starting in 2013, Agriculture Minister Kwesi Ahwoi said
today.  Uganda’s production may rise as much as 13 percent next
season as new trees start bearing fruit, the state-run Cocoa
Development Project said yesterday.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery fell 7
pounds, or 0.4 percent, to settle at 1,893 pounds ($2,991) a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 2.7 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to settle at $1.5585 a pound in New York. The
price has gained 21 percent this year.  Tropical-storm warnings were issued for parts of  Florida ,
the world’s second-biggest orange grower, after a tropical
depression formed out of a collection of thunderstorms in the
western Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center.  Little impact was expected on citrus areas on Florida, said
 Chris Hyde , a meteorologist at MDA EarthSat Weather Inc. in
Rockville, Maryland.  “The system doesn’t look to be as intense as what the
models were predicting last week,” Hyde said.  Florida begins its harvest next month. Brazil is the top
grower.  Storm warnings also were issued for Cuba and the Bahamas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
