(Corrects month in headline, first paragraph.)  The  International Monetary Fund ’s
representative in  Madagascar  will leave at the end of October
and won’t be replaced until a political crisis on the Indian
Ocean island nation is resolved,  l’Express  reported.  The fund is still deciding what to do with its office in
the country, the Antananarivo-based newspaper said, citing
Pierre van den Boogaerde, the country representative.  The IMF’s departure is unlikely to have an immediate impact
on the country as it ceased direct funding of development
programs following an unconstitutional change of government in
2009, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
