Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
said he regretted Colombia’s decision to ban Sen. Piedad Cordoba
from public service for 18 years.       Cordoba, an ally of Chavez, helped broker the release of
more than a dozen hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Colombia’s Inspector General today
dismissed her from the Senate for allegedly promoting and
collaborating with the Marxist rebel army.  Chavez said he was respectful of Colombian government’s
sovereign decision even while disagreeing with its findings.   “I am absolutely sure that Piedad Cordoba is absolutely
innocent,” Chavez told foreign correspondents at the
presidential palace today. “This is an outrage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
