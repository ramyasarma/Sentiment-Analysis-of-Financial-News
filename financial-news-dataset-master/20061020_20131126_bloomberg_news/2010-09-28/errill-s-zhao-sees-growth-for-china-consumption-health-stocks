Andy Zhao, vice president of Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s China research team, said he sees
growth potential in China’s consumption and healthcare stocks.  The nation’s stocks aren’t expensive, Zhao said today at a
briefing in Beijing. There are limited growth opportunites in
large capitalization stocks and risks remain for China’s largest
banks as the government may tighten regulation while also
allowing more foreign companies into the industry and moving
toward more market oriented interest rates, Zhao said.  Merrill expects high net worth individuals in Asia to
increase their allocation of funds to equities and fixed income
products next year, according to a report distributed at the
briefing. Their relative holdings of cash and real estate are
expect to decline, with property continuing to be a key asset
class, Merrill said in its report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
