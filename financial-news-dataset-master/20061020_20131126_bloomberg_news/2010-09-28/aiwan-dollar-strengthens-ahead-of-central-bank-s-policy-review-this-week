Taiwan’s dollar rose for a second
day as economists forecast the central bank will raise borrowing
costs at a policy review this week in response to an improving
economy.  The currency traded near a four-month high after overseas
investors yesterday bought $148 million more Taiwanese shares
than they sold, boosting net purchases for 2010 to $2.9 billion,
according to exchange data. The Central Bank of the Republic of
China (Taiwan) will increase the  discount rate on 10-day loans 
by 12.5 basis points to 1.50 percent on Sept. 30, according to
11 of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Foreign investors are betting the central bank will raise
the benchmark rate as Taiwan’s economic growth is quite
strong,” said  Tarsicio Tong , a currency trader at Union Bank of
Taiwan in Taipei. “The central bank will probably continue to
slow the currency’s rise.”  The Taiwan dollar rose 0.2 percent to NT$31.41 as of 9:22
a.m. local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It yesterday
reached NT$31.37, the strongest level since May 3. The currency
has climbed 2.8 percent this quarter.  The monetary authority intervened in the last minute of
trading yesterday to check currency appreciation, according to
two traders familiar with the matter who declined to be
identified. Taiwan’s dollar, which was 0.7 percent stronger one
minute before trading ended, closed with a gain of 0.5 percent.  The island’s gross domestic product rose 12.5 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, after advancing a record
13.7 percent in the previous three months.  Government bonds rose, snapping a two-day drop. The yield
on the 1.125 percent note maturing in September 2020 slipped one
basis point to 1.2 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, Taiwan’s biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
