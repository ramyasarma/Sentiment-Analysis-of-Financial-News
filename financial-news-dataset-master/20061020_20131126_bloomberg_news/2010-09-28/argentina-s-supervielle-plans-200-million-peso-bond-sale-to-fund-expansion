Grupo Supervielle SA, which owns
Argentina’s  Banco Supervielle SA  and Banco Regional de Cuyo SA,
is preparing the sale of 200 million pesos ($50 million) in
local bonds, said the banks’ President  Juan Carlos Nougues .  The group is awaiting regulatory approval for the sale,
which would be the first by the closely held company, Nougues
said in an interview at his office in Buenos Aires.  “The funds will be used for possible acquisitions or
expansion,” Nougues, 55, said. “It’s a group that is brimming
with plans for the future and at present is in full expansion.”  The planned bond sale comes as Argentine companies and
provinces return to credit markets in the wake of President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s restructuring of $12.9 billion
in defaulted debt in June. South America’s second-biggest
economy hasn’t sold bonds since a record 2001 default on $95
billion.  The provinces of Buenos Aires and Cordoba have taken
advantage of falling borrowing costs to sell bonds abroad.
Buenos Aires this week sold $550 million of five-year notes at a
price to yield 12 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Cordoba sold $400 million of seven-year dollar bonds
last month to yield 12.375 percent.  Banco Supervielle also plans to sell shares in an
international initial public offering, probably in New York
during the second half of next year, Nougues said.  “Banks have high growth potential,” Nougues said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
