China’s government may allocate 30
percent of its alternative-energy spending in the next decade to
wind power, 21st Century Business Herald  reported , citing an
official at the National Energy Administration.  Spending on wind power may reach 1.5 trillion yuan ($224
billion) and solar as much as 300 billion yuan, the newspaper
said, citing  Liang Zhipeng , head of the administration’s new
energy department.  China may spend about 5 trillion yuan through 2020 to
develop cleaner sources of energy to reduce carbon emissions,
Jiang Bing, head of the NEA’s planning and development
department, said in July. The spending plan has been submitted
to the State Council, or Cabinet, and may be introduced at the
year-end, 21st Century Business Herald said.  Of the total expenditure, as much as 3 trillion yuan will
be earmarked for renewable-energy development including wind and
solar, while the rest will be allocated to nuclear and
hydropower, the newspaper said.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
