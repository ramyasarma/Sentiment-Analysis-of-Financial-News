Akzo Nobel NV , the world’s largest
paint maker, pledged to increase this year’s dividend to a level
below analysts’ estimates, sending the Dutch paint maker’s
shares as much as 4 percent lower.  Shareholder  payouts should advance by 5 euro cents to 1.4
euros, according to a strategy update unveiled by Chief
Executive Officer  Hans Wijers  in London today. The pledge falls
short of the average 1.6 euros in a Bloomberg survey of 27
analysts.  Akzo Nobel said consumer caution and the state of the
construction and housing markets continue to weigh on its
outlook. The company aims to raise annual revenue by more than
50 percent to 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in the coming five
years by tapping demand in faster-growing markets such as India
and China and seeking further takeovers.  “The change in dividend policy implies a floor to the
dividend, but the rate of increase in 2010 is disappointing,”
said  Martin Dunwoodie , an analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note.  The Dutch paint-maker plunged 3.8 percent to 45.04 euros as
of 9:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, the biggest drop in more than a
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
