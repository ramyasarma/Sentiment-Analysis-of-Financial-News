Sky Deutschland AG  sold fewer than
two-thirds of the shares it offered as part of a capital
increase that raised the stake of  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. in
the German pay-television operator to 49.9 percent.  The company, based in Unterfoehring near Munich, sold about
169 million shares of the 270 million on offer at 1.05 euros
apiece, it said yesterday in a statement published on DGAP. The
sale raised 177.4 million euros ($241 million), the “first
part” of measures that aim to generate at least 340 million
euros.  News Corp. unit News Adelaide Holdings BV, which bought 64
percent of the shares in the sale, will “backstop” the
remaining financing, which will be secured through a convertible
bond issue or a shareholder loan from News Adelaide, Sky said.
The extra funds will be raised by Jan. 31, 2011.  Sky Deutschland Chief Executive Officer  Brian Sullivan  has
said he plans to use the cash to expand into high-definition
television and invest in innovations and product extensions.  The company’s shares were little changed at 1.05 euros in
Frankfurt, bringing the decline this year to 54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
