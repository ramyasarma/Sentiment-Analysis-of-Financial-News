The U.S. dollar is “one step
nearer” to a crisis as debt levels in the world’s largest
economy increase, said  Yu Yongding , a former adviser to China’s
central bank.  Any appreciation of the dollar is “really temporary” and
a devaluation of the currency is inevitable as U.S. debt rises,
Yu said in a speech in Singapore yesterday.  “Such a huge amount of debt is terrible,” Yu said. “The
situation will be worsening day by day. I think we are one step
nearer to a U.S.-dollar crisis.”  Huang Loses Gome Vote  Jailed billionaire  Huang Guangyu , fighting for control of
the electronics retailer he founded, failed to win investor
support for his proposals to oust its chairman and install his
sister and lawyer as directors.  While Huang, once China’s richest man, is the largest
investor in  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. , 52 percent
of the votes at a special general meeting yesterday were in
favor of keeping  Chen Xiao  as chairman. Still, Huang’s proposal
to cancel a mandate to sell new shares was approved.  Country-Style Surge  Country Style Cooking Restaurant Chain Co. surged 47

expand cooperation on exploration and production in Central Asia
and may swap assets in Russia and China as they each seek to
expand internationally.  The two companies will also discuss fuel supplies to China,
under a partnership accord signed during Russian President
 Dmitry Medvedev ’s visit to Beijing, Lukoil said in a statement.

Citi to more efficiently serve Chinese companies as they expand
overseas,” the bank said in an e-mailed press release.  SITC IPO Pricing  SITC International Holdings Co. , which offers shipping and
logistics services, raised HK$3.1 billion ($400 million) selling
shares in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, according to
two people with knowledge of the transaction.  The Shanghai-based company sold 650 million shares at
HK$4.78 each, the low end of its offer range, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the information was
private. SITC initially offered its shares at HK$4.78 to HK$6.28
each, according to the company’s IPO prospectus.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks advanced, erasing most of the previous day’s
