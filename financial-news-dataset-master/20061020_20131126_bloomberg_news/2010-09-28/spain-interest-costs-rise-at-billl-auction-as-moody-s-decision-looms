Spain sold 3 billion euros ($4
billion) of Treasury bills at an auction, as its borrowing costs
rose two days before a deadline for Moody’s Investors Service to
announce whether it will lower the country’s credit rating.  Spain sold 1.17 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 0.685 percent, compared with 0.624 percent at
the last auction on Aug. 24. It sold 1.81 billion euros of six-
month bills at a yield of 1.18 percent, compared with 1.037
percent in August, the Bank of Spain said. It had set a maximum
target for the auction of 3.5 billion euros.  Moody’s said on June 30 it may cut Spain’s Aaa rating when
it completes a review within three months. Spain is also due to
announce its borrowing plan for 2011 on Sept. 30 as it presents
to parliament the most austere budget in three decades, which
aims to cut the  deficit  in half in two years.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Portuguese and
Irish debt over German equivalents surged to euro-era records
today, increasing pressure on Spain. The  spread  on Spanish 10-
year debt over German bunds rose to 191 basis points at 10:51
a.m. in Madrid, the highest since Aug. 31 and up from 187 basis
points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
