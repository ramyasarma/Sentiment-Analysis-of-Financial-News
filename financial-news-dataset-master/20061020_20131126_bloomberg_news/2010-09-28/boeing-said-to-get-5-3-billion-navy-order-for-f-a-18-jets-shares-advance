Boeing Co.  is set to receive a U.S.
Navy contract today for 124 additional F/A-18 fighter jets
valued at $5.3 billion, two people familiar with the order said.  The contract will be for a mix of the F/A-18 variant called
the Super Hornet and an electronic jamming aircraft called the
Growler, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the Navy hasn’t announced the contract yet.  The Super Hornet entered Navy service in  November 1999 ,
according to the Chicago-based company’s website. Suppliers
include  Northrop Grumman Corp. , which makes the aft and center
fuselage; General Electric Co., which makes the engines; and
Raytheon Co., which makes the radar.  Boeing rose 48 cents to $65 at 4:47 p.m. after the close of
the New York Stock Exchange. The shares climbed 63 cents to
$64.52 in regular trading, extending their gain this year to 19
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
