U.S. stocks extended losses after a
gauge of consumer confidence decreased more than forecast,
spurring concern the economic rebound will stall.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent to
1,132.74 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average retreated 78.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,733.60.  The Conference Board’s confidence index declined to 48.5,
lower than forecast, from 53.2 the prior month, figures from the
New York-based private research group showed today. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
decline to 52.1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
