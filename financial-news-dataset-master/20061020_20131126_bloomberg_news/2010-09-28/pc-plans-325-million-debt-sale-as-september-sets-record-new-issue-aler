 Timothy Cox , an executive director of debt capital markets at

investors can put their money to work.”  Yields on investment-grade debt fell to 3.69 percent
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.

billion issue the same day, Bloomberg data show.  Overall sales of $12.6 billion yesterday propelled issuance
ahead of the previous September record of $124.5 billion set in
2009, the data show. Investment-grade issuance was $11.45
billion, and high-yield, high-risk bond sales were $1.15
billion.  TPC Group LLC plans to use proceeds from its debt offering

for dividends or stock repurchases, according to the statement.  Spreads on high-yield corporate debt widened 4 basis points
to 636 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. Absolute yields fell 2
basis points to 8.12 percent, the lowest since 8.10 percent on
