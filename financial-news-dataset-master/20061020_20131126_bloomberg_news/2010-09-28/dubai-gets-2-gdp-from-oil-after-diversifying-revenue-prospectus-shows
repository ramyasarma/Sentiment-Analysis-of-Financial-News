Dubai’s oil  output made up 2.1
percent of the Persian Gulf emirate’s economy in 2008, slipping
from about half its income in the 1970s, as the sheikhdom
diversified revenue, a government  bond prospectus  showed.  The emirate’s gross domestic product, a measure of the size
of an economy, rose 14 percent in 2008 to 302 billion dirhams
($82.2 billion), according to the bond prospectus posted on the
London Stock Exchange website yesterday. Dubai, the second-
largest sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates behind capital Abu
Dhabi, earned 6.37 billion dirhams from oil and natural gas
production in 2008, a decline from 7.57 billion dirhams in 2005.  Dubai’s GDP accounted for about a third of the UAE’s total
in 2008, according to the prospectus, which didn’t give
estimates for 2009 income. Wholesale and retail trade and repair
and maintenance were Dubai’s largest industries, accounting for
39 percent of nominal GDP. Dubai is seeking to expand in travel
and tourism, financial services, transport and trade after the
global financial crisis hobbled its real estate industry.  The Persian Gulf’s financial hub in October set up a $2.5
billion Islamic medium-term note program and a $4 billion plan
to sell regular bonds. The emirate yesterday released the
prospectus as a supplement to the original data sheets on the $4
billion medium-term note program published last year.  Dubai’s income from oil and gas, which is net of production
expenses, slipped in 2009 due to lower international crude
prices, according to the prospectus. Oil and gas earnings will
decline further in 2010 due to higher capital expenditure, the
prospectus said without providing a figure for 2009 earnings.  Oil Price Slips  Oil in New York slipped to an average price of $62.02 a
barrel in 2009, from an average of $99.74 in 2008, Bloomberg
data show. Dubai’s oil production made up 5 percent of its
income in 2005. Oil output may be between 50,000 and 80,000
barrels a day and the government doesn’t reveal its capacity.  Dubai increased oil development expenditure after a
concession to operate its offshore deposits expired in 2006 and
the government took over production. Capital spending rose in
the last year with the discovery of and work on the offshore Al
Jalila field. There is no estimate available for potential
production capacity at Al Jalila, according to the prospectus.  Emirates National Oil Co., the state’s wholly owned refiner
and fuel retailer, has a market value of 8.65 billion dirhams,
according to the prospectus. Dubai Aluminium Co., the wholly
owned metals producer, was valued at 16 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
