Boeing Co.  received a contract
today for 124 F/A-18 fighter jets valued at $5.3 billion, the
Pentagon said on its website.  The  contract  is for 66 planes of the F/A-18 variant called
the Super Hornet and 58 electronic jamming aircraft called the
Growler, Boeing said today in a separate statement. The Chicago-
based company already is delivering 210 F-18 aircraft under a
five-year, $8.5 billion contract awarded in December 2003.  “Procurement of these 124 aircraft through a multi-year
contract takes advantage of the full efficiencies of Boeing’s
production and supplier operations, which will generate more
than $600 million in cost savings for U.S. taxpayers,” Kory
Mathews, Boeing’s vice president for the program, said in the
statement.  Boeing’s contract is a fixed-price, incentive-fee type that
allows the planemaker to gain more profit if it cuts aircraft
costs. The company will share any overruns with the government.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates favors such contracts because
they encourage defense companies to improve performance on
weapons programs.  “Fast action by the Navy today has saved taxpayers over
half a billion dollars,” Representative  Todd Akin , a Missouri
Republican, said in a statement. The planes will be assembled in
St. Louis, part of Akin’s district.  The Super Hornet entered Navy service in  November 1999 ,
according to the Boeing’s website. Suppliers include  Northrop
Grumman Corp. , which makes the aft and center fuselage; General
Electric Co., which makes the engines; and Raytheon Co., which
makes the radar.  Boeing climbed 63 cents to $64.52 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading before the announcement, extending
its gain this year to 19 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
