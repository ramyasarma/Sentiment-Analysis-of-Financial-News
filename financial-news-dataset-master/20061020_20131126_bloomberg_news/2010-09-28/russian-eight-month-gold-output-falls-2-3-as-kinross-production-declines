Russia’s gold production in the
first eight months slid 2.3 percent from the same period last
year to 123.5 metric tons, led by a drop in output at mines
belonging to Kinross Gold Corp. and Petropavlovsk Plc.  August production increased by 1.5 tons from the same month
a year earlier, the Russian Gold Producers’ Union said in a
statement today, without being more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
