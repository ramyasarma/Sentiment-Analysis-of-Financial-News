The Pimco Strategic Global
Government  Fund  may fall almost 10 percent after completing a
double-top trading pattern, according to  Recognia Inc. , an
investment research company specializing in technical analysis.  The fund’s price may decline to a range of 9.6 to 9.8,
Recognia said, from 10.62 yesterday. The pattern was formed over
46 days, which is roughly the time it will take to reach the new
target, it said. Recognia, based in Ottawa, Canada, issued its
report on Sept. 24.  A graph of the fund price starting in July consists of two
peaks with a trough in the middle. The double top-pattern,
sometimes called an “M” formation, suggests the price will
extend recent declines, according to Recognia.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Strategic Global Fund
returned almost 10 percent this year, versus 14 percent on
average for its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Strategic Global is a closed-end  fund  whose shares trade on the
New York Stock Exchange. Pimco, based in Newport Beach,
California, also manages the Total Return Fund, the world’s
biggest mutual fund.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
