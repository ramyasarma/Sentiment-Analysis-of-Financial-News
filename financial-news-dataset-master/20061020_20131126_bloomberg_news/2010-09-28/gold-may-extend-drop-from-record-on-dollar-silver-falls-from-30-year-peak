Gold fell for a second day in
London as the euro’s decline curbed demand for precious metals
as an alternative to currencies. Silver retreated 1.6 percent.  The euro dropped as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar
amid speculation European government debts will derail growth.
Gold was unable to extend gains from a record $1,300.15 an ounce
yesterday, contributing to selling, said  Afshin Nabavi , a senior
vice president at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva.  “The euro is under pressure,” Nabavi said. Gold may drop
to the “low $1,280s” as early as today, he said.  Gold for immediate delivery fell $6.03, or 0.5 percent, to
$1,288.32 an ounce at 8:55 a.m. local time. Gold futures for
December delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $1,288 an ounce on the
Comex in New York.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,300.52 metric
tons as of yesterday, according to figures on the company’s
website. Major holders include billionaire  John Paulson ’s New
York-based Paulson & Co.  Gold is “a great asset for people who are rich and who
want to stay rich,” said  Graham Birch , a former manager of
BlackRock Inc.’s BGF World Gold Fund, at the London Bullion
Market Association conference in Berlin yesterday.  Gold prices gained this year even as U.S. inflation slowed.
Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising
consumer prices.  Silver dropped as much as 1.6 percent and was last down 1.3
percent at $21.1388 an ounce. Platinum declined 1.3 percent to
$1,611 an ounce and palladium lost 1.4 percent to $544.50 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
