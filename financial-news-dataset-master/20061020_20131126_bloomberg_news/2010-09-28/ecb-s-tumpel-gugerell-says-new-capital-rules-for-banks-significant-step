European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell  said global regulators’
decision to toughen capital requirements for banks is a
“significant step” toward a more resilient system.  “The reform strikes the right balance between the overall
objective of strengthening the resilience of the financial
sector and thus creating a sounder banking and financial system
on the one hand and avoiding unduly severe implications on
national banking systems and the real economy,” Tumpel-Gugerell
said at a conference in Brussels today. The “phasing-in and
transition arrangements” over eight years are “realistic.”  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  said on Sept. 12
that lenders will be required to have common equity equal to at
least 4.5 percent of assets, weighted according to their risk,
as well as a capital buffer of 2.5 percent to withstand future
stress. Under the so-called Basel III rules, banks that fail to
meet that second buffer would be stopped from paying dividends.  The Group of 20 nations will take the final decision on
reforms when leaders meet in November in Seoul.  To contact the reporters on this story:
