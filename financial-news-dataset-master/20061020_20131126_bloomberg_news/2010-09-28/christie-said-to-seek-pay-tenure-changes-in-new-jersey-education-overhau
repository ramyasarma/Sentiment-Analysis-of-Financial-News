New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
said he wants to lower the state’s top income-tax rate to 6
percent from 9 percent to boost economic growth.  The Republican governor, who took office in January, said
he hopes to make the tax cut before the end of his four-year
term. Christie said the state economy benefited in the 1980s and
1990s, when the top rate was 6 percent.  “That’s what my goal is, and I hope to get there over my
first term,” Christie said today in a keynote address at a UBS
conference on public finance in New York. “Six percent allowed
for some tremendous economic growth then, and it can again.”  Christie said the state’s taxpayers are struggling after
his predecessors raised taxes and fees 115 times in the eight
years before he took office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
