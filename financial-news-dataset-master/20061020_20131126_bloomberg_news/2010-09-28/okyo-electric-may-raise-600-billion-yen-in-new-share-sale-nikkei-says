Tokyo Electric Power Co. may raise
as much as 600 billion yen ($7.15 billion) in a sale of new
shares, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  The Japanese energy company will spend the funds to build
nuclear power plants and expand overseas, the Nikkei said.   Masayuki Kishino, a Tepco spokesman, said the company
wasn’t the source of the report and it had nothing to disclose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
