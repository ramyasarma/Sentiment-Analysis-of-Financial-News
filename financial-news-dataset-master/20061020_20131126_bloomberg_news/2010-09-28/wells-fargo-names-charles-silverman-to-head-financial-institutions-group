Wells Fargo & Co ., the fourth-
largest U.S. bank, named  Charles Silverman  head of the global
financial institutions group, which offers international banking
services through more than 30 offices around the world.  Silverman succeeds  Michael Heavener , who retired Sept. 1
after 42 years at the San Francisco-based company, Wells Fargo
said in a statement today. Silverman, an executive vice
president for global financial institutions product distribution
and network services, joined a predecessor company in 1988. His
previous jobs have included area head of South Asia and
Southeast Asia.  Wells Fargo’s international group has more than 2,500
employees in 24 nations, according to a company  report  in March.
The bank ranks first in correspondent banking market share in
Asia and Latin America and second in Western Europe, according
to Fimetrix, a research company based in Pennington, New Jersey.  Correspondent banking enables a bank’s business customers
to process payments through another lender when they don’t have
a physical presence in a market. Wachovia Corp, acquired by
Wells Fargo & Co. in 2009, expanded in Asia through the 2005
purchase of the international banking business of Union Bank of
California. The purchase covered about 600 correspondent banks
and as much as $2 billion of loans, Wachovia said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
