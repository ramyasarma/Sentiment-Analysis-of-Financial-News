Gold may advance 12 percent to a
record $1,450 an ounce in a year, according to the average
response in a survey of attendees at the London Bullion Market
Association’s annual conference.  The estimate is above yesterday’s prediction for a price of
$1,406 an ounce by the time of the LBMA’s next gathering in
September 2011. Immediate-delivery bullion reached an all-time
high of $1,300.15 in London yesterday. Silver, platinum and
palladium will also increase, today’s survey showed.  “We see weakness in the dollar in the next 12 months,”
 Frederic Panizzutti , a senior vice president of Geneva-based
bullion refiner MKS Finance SA, said today in an interview at
the conference. “This is positive for gold. There’s a total
lack of safe alternatives.”  Bullion has outperformed global equities and most
industrial metals this year. It’s on course for a 10th
consecutive annual advance, the longest winning streak since at
least 1920, as investors seek a shield from weaker currencies
and the possibility that economies may return to recession.  “Investors are now more long term and not buying gold to
make an immediate profit,” Panizzutti said. “They’re buying to
protect assets.”  Record ETP Assets  Gold held through 10 providers of exchange-traded products
reached a record 2,089.74 metric tons on Sept. 22, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s almost as much as the
combined official reserves of China and Switzerland, based on
data compiled by the London-based World Gold Council.  A survey of about 140 attendees at last year’s conference
in November forecast gold would climb to $1,181 by this month.
The current gathering in Berlin has more attendees, LBMA Chief
Executive Officer  Stewart Murray  said yesterday. The group plans
to hold its next conference in Montreal.  The dollar will be weaker in 12 months’ time, 64 percent of
respondents said in today’s survey. U.S. inflation will climb,
according to 63 percent, though no “double-dip” recession will
occur, the same portion said.  Gold has gained this year even as U.S. inflation slowed.
Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising
consumer prices. The metal traded at $1,289.28 an ounce at 12:45
p.m. in London today.  Silver will climb 13 percent to $24 an ounce in about 12
months, today’s survey showed. Platinum will rise 15 percent to
$1,857 an ounce and palladium will gain 28 percent to $702 an
ounce, it showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
