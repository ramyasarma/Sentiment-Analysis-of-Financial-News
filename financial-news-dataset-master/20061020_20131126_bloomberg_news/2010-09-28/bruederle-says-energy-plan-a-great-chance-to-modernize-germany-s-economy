German Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle said that the government’s energy plans, approved by
Cabinet in Berlin today, offer a “great chance” to modernize
the economy.  Nuclear reactors will be licensed to operate for an average
of 12 years longer, he said. Building a new electricity
transmission network is the “backbone” of the energy plan,
Bruederle told reporters in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
