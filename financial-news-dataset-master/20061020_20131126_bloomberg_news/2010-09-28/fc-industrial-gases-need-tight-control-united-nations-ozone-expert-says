Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons
need to be curbed and regulators must tighten controls over the
“unwanted” HFC-23 greenhouse gas, said Rajendra Shende, head
of ozone branch at the United Nations Environment Program.  Governments worldwide are considering phasing out the
production of hydrofluorocarbon-23 under the ozone-protection
rules of the Montreal Protocol. Regulators of the UN carbon
market are under scrutiny over allegations that some investors
are profiting unduly from emission offset credits related to the
gas. The warming potential per molecule is 11,700 times more
powerful than carbon dioxide.  The European Union is working on a proposal to restrict
some offsets linked to industrial gases that can be used for
compliance in its own emissions trading system.  “Efforts to regulate HFCs have already been announced by
the EU, there are also proposals under the Montreal Protocol and
the regulations need to be tightened,” Shende said in an
interview in Brussels during the Atmosphere 2010 workshop.
“Time is the essence. Things may change fast as there’s growing
realization that we need to act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
