Reliance Power Ltd. , owned by
billionaire  Anil Ambani , plans to increase electricity
generation capacity eightfold to 5,000 megawatts in two years.  The utility will further raise generation capacity to
25,000 megawatts by 2015, Chairman Ambani told shareholders in
Mumbai today. Reliance Power currently produces 600 megawatts,
he said in a televised speech.  The company, which received a record $2.5 billion in a
January 2008 initial public offer, plans to raise more funds
through the sale of shares to institutions and overseas
securities as it tries to meet capacity addition targets. Half
the IPO funds have been spent, according to a filing with
 National Stock Exchange  on Aug. 12.  Reliance Power  shares  climbed 1.2 percent to 162.75 rupees
at 12:06 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has gained 5 percent
this year compared with a 15 percent increase in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index .  Reliance Power, based in Mumbai, plans to build 35,000
megawatts of capacity, according to the Aug. 12 filing. Since
the IPO, the company has started one project, the 1,200-megawatt
Rosa plant, which is half complete, according to a statement to
the Bombay Stock Exchange on June 17.  The utility plans to add 3,000 megawatts of hydro power
capacity by 2016 and 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity
over five years, Ambani said.  Reliance Power has 2 billion metric tons of coal reserves
in India that can be used to generate 20,000 megawatts, Ambani
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
