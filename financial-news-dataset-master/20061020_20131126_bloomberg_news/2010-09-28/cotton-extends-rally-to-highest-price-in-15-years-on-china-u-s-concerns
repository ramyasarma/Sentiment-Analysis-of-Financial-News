Cotton futures extended a rally to
a 15-year high on escalating concern that global supplies will
trail demand.  China, the world’s biggest grower and consumer, plans to
auction an additional 400,000 metic tons from reserves to meet
demand from the textile industry. The nation’s output may fall
“slightly” this year, the National Development and Reform
Commission said yesterday. Inventories monitored by ICE Futures
U.S. are close to the lowest level since at least 2002.  “For months, we’ve been talking about tight stocks,” said
 Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in
Moultrie, Georgia. “The market has an upside destiny, and it’s
just going to go there.”  Cotton for December delivery rose 1.31 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.0524 a pound at 2:49 p.m. on ICE in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1.064, the highest level for a
most-active contract since June 1995. The fiber has jumped 67
percent in the past 12 months.  The China Cotton Association said yesterday that domestic
use exceeded output by 3.6 million tons in the year ended Aug.
31, wider than the year-earlier deficit of 2.6 million,  “Cotton prices have been driven higher by rising Chinese
imports,” Deutsche Bank said today in a report. The U.S. is the
biggest exporter.  India, the second-biggest grower, will allow exports
starting Nov. 1, Rita Menon, the secretary in the ministry of
textiles, said today. Suppliers can register shipments starting
Oct. 1 Menon said, reiterating earlier government decisions.  Crop conditions in the U.S. deteriorated in the week ended
Sept. 26 with 55 percent of cotton rated in good or excellent
condition, down from 58 percent a week earlier, the government
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
