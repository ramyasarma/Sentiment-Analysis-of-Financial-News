The Philadelphia Phillies clinched
their fourth straight National League Eastern Division title as
 Roy Halladay  pitched a two-hitter in an 8-0 victory over the
Washington Nationals.  The Phillies improved to 20-5 this month and 94-63 overall,
moving past the Tampa Bay Rays for the best record in Major
League Baseball.  The Rays and New York Yankees both missed chances to secure
playoff berths with losses yesterday.  Tampa Bay lost 4-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, yet maintained
a half-game lead atop the American League East when the Yankees
lost to the Toronto Blue Jays 7-5. Tampa Bay has 93-63 record
while the Yankees are 93-64.  Halladay, who never reached the postseason in his first 12
seasons in Toronto, opened the first bottle of champagne during
the Phillies’ postgame celebration last night. The 2003 Cy Young
Award winner, Halladay allowed two singles in becoming the first
major-league pitcher with 21 wins this season.  “We’re just starting,” Halladay, who signed a three-year,
$60 million contract extension after joining the Phillies, said
according to MLB.com. “I’m looking forward to moving forward.
It should be a lot of fun.”  Jayson Werth  hit a home run and drove in four runs for
Philadelphia, which is the third NL team to make at least four
straight postseason appearances. The Atlanta Braves made 14 in a
row from 1991 to 2005, while the New York Giants went to the
playoffs four consecutive times from 1921-24.  Wild Card Race  Although Atlanta’s chance of winning the NL East ended with
the Phillies’ win, the Braves moved a half-game ahead of the San
Diego Padres in the race for the NL wild card.  The wild card berth goes to the division runner-up with the
best record.  The Braves (88-69) beat the Florida Marlins 2-1 in 11
innings and the Padres (87-69) lost to the Chicago Cubs 1-0.  The Rays were denied a chance to celebrate at home as  Brian Matusz  pitched seven scoreless innings to help the Orioles halt
a four-game losing streak.  The Yankees weren’t able to recover in Toronto after  A.J. Burnett  gave up seven runs in 2 1/3 innings.  The Boston Red Sox kept their slim playoff chances alive
with a 6-1 win over the Chicago White Sox.  The Red Sox (87-69) trail the Yankees by 5 1/2 games in the
race for the AL wild card playoff spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
