Q-Cells SE was cut to “sell” from
“hold” at Steubing AG, which cited the solar company’s efforts
to raise capital and said “the cash situation after all the
measures will remain far from relaxed.”  Q-Cells said it will start a rights offering, issue a
convertible bond and offered to repurchase a 2007/2012
convertible bond to help secure its medium-term financing.  The shares lost 2.1 percent to 4.73 euros as of 9:45 a.m.
in Frankfurt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
