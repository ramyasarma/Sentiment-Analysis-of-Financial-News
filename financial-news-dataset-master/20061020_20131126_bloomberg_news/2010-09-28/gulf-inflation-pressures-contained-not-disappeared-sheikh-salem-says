Inflationary pressures in Gulf
Cooperation Council countries are “contained” though they
haven’t disappeared completely, Kuwaiti Central Bank Governor
Sheikh Salem Abdul Aziz Al-Sabah said.  “The global increase in food prices needs attention,”
Sheikh Salem said in Kuwait City today, according to the text of
a speech delivered at a meeting of central bankers from the GCC
countries. “Inflation in the GCC has been noticeably contained,
but that does not mean that these pressures have disappeared
completely.”  Inflation in Saudi Arabia, the largest economy among the
six GCC members, climbed for a seventh month to 6.1 percent in
August on higher global food prices, Saudi central bank Governor
 Muhammad al-Jasser  said on Sept. 26. While the increase is
“worrying,” it’s premature to make conclusions on consumer
prices this year, al-Jasser said.  Saudi inflation  may slow to 5.5 percent by the end of the
year, according to a Sept. 25 report by  Al-Rajhi Capital . GCC
members Kuwait and Bahrain have also reported a pickup in
inflation in recent months. The rate in Kuwait may rise as high
as 4.5 percent by the end of the year, from 4 percent in July,
Sheikh Salem said.  The other members of the group are Oman, the United Arab
Emirates and Qatar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
