The leader of South Africa’s
biggest labor grouping, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, said the country’s ruling alliance risks imploding by
2012 unless the African National Congress stamps out corruption.  While the ANC’s five-day National General Council policy
meeting last week was a “complete success,” the party must now
deliver on commitments to prevent members using their position
to access public funds, Cosatu General Secretary  Zwelinzima Vavi 
told health and education workers in Johannesburg today.  “If there was a criticism of the ANC NGC it would be its
failure to articulate a clear and systematic program to lead
society in a battle against corruption,” Vavi said. A lack of
progress in tackling graft will raise the “risk of implosion.”  The two-million-member Cosatu has threatened to abandon its
alliance with the ANC, which also includes the South African
Communist Party and dates back to before the end of white
minority rule in 1994. Apart from promises to root out corrupt
members, Cosatu leaders welcomed a commitment to increase state
control in mining, energy and banking.  Teachers and nurses and other state employees have until
Oct. 4 to decide on a government offer to raise wages by 7.5
percent, after suspending a 20-day strike which disrupted
hospitals and closed schools in Africa’s largest economy. Labor
unions have said that corruption in government made workers less
likely to accept a wage offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
