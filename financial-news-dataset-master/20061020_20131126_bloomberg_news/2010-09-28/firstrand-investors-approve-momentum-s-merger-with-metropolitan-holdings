Investors in  FirstRand Ltd ., South
Africa’s second-biggest financial services company, approved its
insurance unit’s merger with  Metropolitan Holdings Ltd.   More than 99 percent of Johannesburg-based FirstRand’s
shareholders approved the transaction at a meeting in the city
today, according to votes tallied by Computershare Ltd.  FirstRand, which owns South Africa’s largest provider of
auto-loans and third-largest retail bank, is spinning off
Momentum at a time when similar companies are splitting banking
and insurance to reduce complexity.  Old Mutual Plc , the biggest
insurer in Africa, is in talks to sell its banking unit,  Nedbank
Group Ltd. , to  HSBC Holdings Plc .  When the transaction is completed in December, Momentum and
Cape Town-based Metropolitan’s merged entity, to be called MMI
Holdings Ltd., will be the third-largest listed insurer in South
Africa, with an embedded value of about 30 billion rand ($4.28
billion).  FirstRand’s stock has  advanced  13 percent this year,
valuing the company at 117 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
