The dollar traded at almost a five-
month low against the euro after U.S. home prices rose at a
slower pace in July, fueling speculation the Federal Reserve
will ease monetary policy.  The greenback was mixed against 16 most-traded counterparts
as U.S. economic reports were expected to increase the
likelihood the central bank will restart the purchase of
government debt. The yen strengthened against the dollar to the
strongest level since Japan intervened in the market Sept. 15 to
weaken the currency.  “The market is looking for the high-frequency growth data
to help predict the path that lies ahead for the Fed,” said
 Camilla Sutton , a Bank of Nova Scotia currency strategist in
Toronto. “Consumer confidence by any measure is still
historically very low.”  The dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.3489 per euro at 9:11
a.m. in New York, compared with $1.3455 yesterday, when it slid
to $1.3507, the weakest level since April 20. The euro bought
113.44 yen, compared with 113.41 yen, after touching 112.67 yen.  The yen strengthened 0.2 percent to 84.09 yen per dollar,
from 84.29, the highest level since Sept. 15, when it also
touched a 15-year low of 82.88.  Japan sold its currency in an attempt to sustain an export-
led recovery. Demand for the yen has been tempered by
speculation Japan will sell its currency again.  Housing Prices  Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose at a slower pace in July
from a year earlier, reflecting a drop in sales following the
end of a government tax credit.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased 3.2
percent from July 2009, the smallest year-over-year gain since
March, the group said today in New York.  The Conference Board’s U.S. consumer confidence index
decreased to 52.1 this month from 53.5 in August, according to
another survey. The report from the New York-based research
group is scheduled for release at 10 a.m. in New York.  The dollar has depreciated 9.1 percent versus the euro
this quarter in the worst performance among the European
currency’s 16 major counterparts. The greenback has pared this
year’s advance to 6.3 percent.  The euro erased its loss against the franc as European
stocks reversed their losses. Investors traditionally buy the
franc during times of economic turmoil because of the perceived
stability of the Swiss economy and current account surplus, and
offload the currency when they want to take on more risk.  The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 1.3286 per euro from
1.3258 yesterday.  “The concern in the euro zone in terms of the debt issues
there, they’re a bit more simmering rather than blazing, where
they were in the spring,”  Robert Sinche , global head of foreign
exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities unit in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a radio
interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .
“It’s a reminder that the issues there, although not front page
every day, still haven’t gone away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
