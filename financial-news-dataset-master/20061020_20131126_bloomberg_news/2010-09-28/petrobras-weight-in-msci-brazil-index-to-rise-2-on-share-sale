Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, will see its weight in the MSCI
Brazil Index increase by about two percentage points because of
its $70 billion share sale, MSCI said.  Effective Sept. 30, the company’s preferred shares will add
2.2 percentage points to 11.1 percent of the measure while its
common shares will rise 1.8 points to 9.1 percent, Raman Aylur
Subramanian, MSCI’s vice president of index research, said in a
phone interview from New York.  Petrobras last week sold 1.87 billion preferred shares and
2.4 billion common shares. While the company’s total number of
shares climbed, an increase in government participation kept
Petrobras’s weight from gaining more, Subramanian said.
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Sept. 24 that
Brazil is boosting its stake in Petrobras to 48 percent from 40
percent.  Subramanian declined to say how much Petrobras’s weight
will rise in other MSCI indexes. The final increase may be
revised depending on stock price moves, he said.  Petrobras advanced 0.8 percent to 26.70 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
