The German government plans to cut
carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 and set
out a path to reach that target under an energy plan unveiled in
Berlin today.  Reductions of the greenhouse gas will reach 55 percent by
2030 from 1990 levels and 70 percent by 2040, the environment
ministry said on its website. In 10 years time, Germany plans to
lower gas discharges by 40 percent, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
