President  Barack Obama  said it is
“inexcusable” for Democrats or progressives not to vote in the
midterm elections.  “We have to get folks off the sidelines,” Obama said in an
interview with Rolling Stone magazine, on newsstands Oct. 1.
“People need to shake off this lethargy, people need to buck
up.”  The president today opens a two-day, get-out-the vote
campaign in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa and Virginia, five weeks
before the Nov. 2 elections.  Obama and other administration officials are pressing
progressives to vote in November. With Republicans poised to
make gains and possibly retake control of the House, the
president is highlighting the consequences if Democrats sustain
serious losses, an administration official said.  Vice President  Joe Biden  said yesterday at a New Hampshire
fundraiser that Democrats must “remind our base constituency to
stop whining.”  The non-partisan Cook Political Report in Washington
forecasts Republicans will gain at least 40 seats in November’s
election, one more than needed to win control of the 435-member
U.S. House.  In the Senate, where Republicans hold 41 of 100 seats, the
Cook report says they are poised to pick up from seven to nine
seats.  “The idea that we’ve got a lack of enthusiasm in the
Democratic base, that people are sitting on their hands
complaining, is just irresponsible,” Obama said in the Rolling
Stone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
