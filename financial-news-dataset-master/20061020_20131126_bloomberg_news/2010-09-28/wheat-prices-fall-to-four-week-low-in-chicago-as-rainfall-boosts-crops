Wheat fell to the lowest price this
month as planting in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter,
progresses with ample rainfall in key areas.  About 21 percent of the fields were seeded in Kansas, the
biggest winter-wheat producer, as of Sept. 26, up from 11
percent a week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture  said 
yesterday. The U.S. crop was 33 percent planted, up from 20
percent. While the figures are behind the average pace of the
previous five years, there’s no need for concern, said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas.  “We’re not going to be delayed because the wheat is in
different stages right now,” Glenn said. “Some guys are
stopping the harvest to let the corn dry down, and then wheat
planting is starting. For the most part, the state of Kansas is
going to be in decent shape for moisture.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 21.75 cents, or
3.1 percent, to close at $6.8475 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the commodity touched $6.845,
the lowest level since Aug. 31.  The price is up 43 percent since the end of June as wet
weather curbed production in Canada and the worst drought in 50
years hurt Russian crops.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
