Corn fell for a second day in
Chicago as the harvest in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter
of the grain, progressed more quickly than average.  December-delivery corn dropped 0.8 percent to $5.0875 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time.
The most-active contract yesterday touched $5.2875, the highest
price since September 2008.  About 27 percent of the U.S. corn crop was harvested as of
Sept. 26, compared with 6 percent a year earlier and a five-year
average of 15 percent, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported yesterday.  “The harvest is in full swing, with 27 percent of the crop
already under cover,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said in his
daily newsletter. “All things considered, we are still going to
grow a huge crop of corn here in the U.S.”  The USDA is scheduled to release its estimate of the
nation’s quarterly stockpiles of soybeans, corn, wheat, and
other grains on Sept. 30.  “Investors are expecting corn and soybean stocks to be
lower,”  Chung Yang Ker , an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said
by phone from Singapore. “They might need further confirmation
before they re-enter the market.”  Soybeans for November delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$11.2175 a bushel after climbing for four sessions through
yesterday.  About 17 percent of the U.S. soybean crop was harvested, up
from 5 percent a year ago, and compared with the 13 percent
average in the past five years, the USDA said yesterday.  Wheat for December delivery fell 1.5 percent to $6.9625 a
bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris slid 1.7 percent to 216.75 euros ($291.87) a metric
ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
