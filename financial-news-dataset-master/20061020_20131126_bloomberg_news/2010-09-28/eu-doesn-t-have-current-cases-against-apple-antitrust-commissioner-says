Joaquin Almunia , the European
Union’s antitrust commissioner, said the European Commission
doesn’t have any current cases against  Apple Inc .  “We have no cases now going on,” he said on the sidelines
of a competition conference in Brussels today. He said that
didn’t mean the commission wouldn’t consider any further
 complaints  against the company.  On Sept. 25, the commission  said  it had closed
investigations into Apple’s practices after it relaxed
restrictions on the development tools for iPhone applications
and introduced cross-border iPhone warranty repair services
within the EU region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
