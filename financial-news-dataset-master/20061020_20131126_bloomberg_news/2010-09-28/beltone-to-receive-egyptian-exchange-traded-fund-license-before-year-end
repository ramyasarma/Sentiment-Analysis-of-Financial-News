Beltone Financial , an Egyptian
investment bank, may receive an exchange-traded fund license
before the end of the year,  Khaled Seyam , chairman of the
Egyptian Exchange, said.  “We are at the final stage, the stage of signing
contracts,” he told reporters at an investment conference today
in Cairo. “Beltone is the only applicant but other firms have
started talking about getting in.”  Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30  index has gained 7.7 percent this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The exchange-
traded funds, known as ETFs, trade like stocks and allow
investors to track indexes and make bets on whether they will
rise or fall. The bourse will begin listing funds based on the
benchmark index, Seyam said.  Two Egyptian companies have contacted the bourse to sell
their shares to the public on the exchange this year, Seyam
said. He declined to identify the companies.  “If the conditions and road shows of those two companies
are going well then I guess we will have a minimum of one or
two” initial public offerings.  Juhayna Food Industries , Egypt’s biggest seller of packaged
milk, was the last company to sell its shares on the exchange in
June, raising 1 billion Egyptian pounds ($175 million).  -Editors: Inal Ersan, Claudia Maedler  To contact the reporter on this story:
