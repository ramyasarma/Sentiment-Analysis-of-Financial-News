AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. , the world’s
third-largest gold producer, said Australia’s government should
give tax incentives for lower energy consumption rather than
place a levy on carbon emissions.  “The real issue for us is how do we reduce our consumption,
either by consuming less or by consuming stuff that’s been
produced in a more efficient way,” Chief Executive Officer  Mark Cutifani  said during a conference call with reporters. “That’s
where the point of taxation should occur.”  Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , who pledged to
tackle climate change after replacing  Kevin Rudd  in June, is
seeking to build a consensus on measures to cut emissions. BHP
Billiton Ltd. Chief Executive Officer  Marius Kloppers  on Sept.
15 called for the government to implement a carbon tax rather
than start an emissions-trading program.  “Revenue from a consumption tax in my view should then be
directed to energy-effective solutions to help us actually
reduce our carbon footprint,” Cutifani said. “We have to find
smarter ways to produce outcomes.”  Johannesburg-based AngloGold, Africa’s largest gold
producer, operates the Sunrise Dam mine and is developing the
A$600 million ($576 million) Tropicana project in Western
Australia.  AngloGold has identified options to cut 20 percent of the
Tropicana mine’s planned energy consumption by making changes to
the operation process and using solar panels, Cutifani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
