European central banks bought Irish
government  debt  after yields on the nation’s two-year notes
surged to the most since at least 2003, according to three
people with knowledge of the transactions.  The purchases focused on securities with maturities of as
long as five years, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the deals are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
