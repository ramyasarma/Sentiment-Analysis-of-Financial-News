Galvin La Chapelle was last night
named AA London Restaurant of the Year while  Gordon Ramsay  lost
his fifth rosette.  Brothers Chris and Jeff Galvin’s Spitalfields venue, which
opened last November, topped the awards ceremony attended by 700
guests. Simon Rogan at L’Enclume in Cartmel won a fifth rosette,
taking him to the top tier of the AA’s culinary elite. Ramsay’s
flagship restaurant on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea was
awarded four rosettes.  The Harrow at Little Bedwyn, Marlborough, won English
Restaurant of the Year. Peat Inn, Fife, and the Hardwick,
Abergavenny, took the Scottish and Welsh awards. Martin Wishart
of Edinburgh won Chefs’ Chef of the Year.  George Goring  of the
Goring Hotel received the gong for lifetime achievement.  Brothers Chris and Jeff have won several accolades since
opening Galvin La Chapelle in a converted 19th century hall last
November. They were restaurateurs of the year in the Cateys
industry awards and La Chapelle was Zagat’s best newcomer
earlier this month.  Last night’s AA Hospitality Awards were announced at a
dinner prepared by chef  Marcus Wareing  at the London Hilton.  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
