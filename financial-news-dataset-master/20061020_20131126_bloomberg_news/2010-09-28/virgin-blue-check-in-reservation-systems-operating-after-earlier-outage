Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. ,
Australia’s second-biggest airline, said its reservation and
check-in systems were “up and running” this morning after a
second computer glitch disrupted passengers’ travel plans.  The airline’s computer system failed at about 5:00 a.m.
local time causing flight delays around the country and
passengers to be manually checked in, the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website.  “Our systems are operational,” Virgin Blue said on its
website. “All forms of check-in are currently available for
use.” Two domestic flights were cancelled this morning, the
airline said. The company declined to say how many passengers
were affected when contacted by Bloomberg News.  A computer glitch on Sept. 26 affecting Virgin Blue check-
in counters left thousands of passengers in the country
stranded, the Australian newspaper reported on its website at
the time, citing company spokesman  Colin Lippiatt . Some Virgin
Pacific international flights were also affected, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
