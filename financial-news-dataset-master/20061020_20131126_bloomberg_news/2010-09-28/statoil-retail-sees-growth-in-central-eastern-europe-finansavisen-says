Statoil ASA’s head of Fuel &
Retail, Jacob Schram, sees most growth for the unit in central
and eastern Europe, Finansavisen reported, citing Schram.  Schram said Poland was expected to be the growth engine for
Statoil’s retail business, the Oslo-based newspaper reported.   Statoil is planning an initial public offering of its fuel
and retail unit in October. The company would consider entering
into larger deals with other actors in the industry, Schram
said, without specifying further, according to Finansavisen.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
