Toronto-Dominion Bank , Canada’s
second-largest lender by assets, said  Brian Levitt  will become
chairman on Jan. 1, replacing  John Thompson .  Levitt, a lawyer with Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP, has been
on the board since December 2008, the Toronto-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. He also serves on the boards of
BCE Inc., Bell Canada and Domtar Corp., according to a
regulatory filing in February.  Thompson made a “personal decision” to step down after
seven years in the role, and will remain on the board, the bank
said.  “I’m not approaching this with a particular agenda,”
Levitt, 63, said today in a telephone interview. “I think we
just have to keep the machine humming.”  Toronto-Dominion said Sept. 2 that profit rose for the
third straight quarter, led by record consumer-banking earnings
in Canada and the U.S.  The board has been focusing on strategic issues, as well as
the “rapidly and fundamentally changing regulatory
environment,” Levitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
