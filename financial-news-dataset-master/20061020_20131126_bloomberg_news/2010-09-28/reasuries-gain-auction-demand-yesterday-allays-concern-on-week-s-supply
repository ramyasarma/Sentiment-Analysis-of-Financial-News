Treasuries  gained as the
government’s $35 billion sale of five-year notes drew the lowest
yield since the government began quarterly offerings of the
securities in 1976.  The yield on the current five-year debt fell to the  lowest
level  in almost two years as a drop in consumer confidence
spurred speculation that the Fed will increase purchases of
Treasuries to support the economy. The securities were auctioned
today at a yield of 1.260 percent, compared with the 1.276
percent average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 8 of the
18 primary dealers obligated to participate in U.S. debt sales.  “You have new pieces of uncertainty, with the Fed and
quantitative easing 2 priced in,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees
$8 billion at SEI Investments Co. in Oaks, Pennsylvania. “With
the volatility in the marketplace, you’re going to see the
Treasury market well-bid.”  The current five-year note yield dropped 6 basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.23 percent at 4:18 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 1.25 percent
security maturing in August 2015 gained 9/32, or $2.81 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 3/32.  The  yield  touched 1.22 percent, the lowest level since Dec.
17, 2008, the day after the Fed cut its target lending rate to
zero to 0.25 percent. Yields on two-year notes dropped 2 basis
points to 0.43 percent, compared with the record low of 0.41
percent reached on Sept. 22. Benchmark 10-year note yields slid
6 basis points to 2.47 percent.  Flatter Yield Curve  The  extra yield  investors pay to hold 10-year notes over 2-
year debt dropped to 2.04 percentage points, the narrowest
spread since Aug. 31, reflecting concern the U.S. economic
recovery is stalling.  “What’s going on further out the curve is a function of
the idea that the Fed’s going to be out there buying,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
Stamford, Connecticut. The Fed’s “going to continue to be a
constant buyer in the Treasury market and presumably keep rates
contained through that process,” he said.  At today’s auction, indirect bidders, an investor class
that includes foreign central banks, purchased 50.1 percent of
the notes, compared with 50.8 percent at the last auction on
Aug. 25 and an average of 46 percent in the past 10 sales.
Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their
bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.7 percent, matching
the share in August.  Auction Demand  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.96,
compared with an average of 2.74 at the past 10 auctions.  Yesterday’s $36 billion auction drew a record-low yield of
0.441 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.78, the highest
since August 2007. The government will auction $29 billion of
seven-year debt tomorrow.  Treasuries rose earlier as the Conference Board’s
confidence index declined in September to 48.5, the lowest level
since February. The median forecast of 75 economists in a
 Bloomberg News survey  was for a drop to 52.1.  The Fed announced following its Sept. 21 meeting that it’s
prepared to do more to help the economy, spurring speculation
policy makers will add securities to the central bank’s holdings
by increasing their Treasury purchases under a policy known as
quantitative easing.  The central bank retained last week its stance from its
Aug. 10 meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at
about $2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the
financial system. The Fed bought $550 million of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities today, increasing the total
amount of U.S. debt purchased since Aug. 17 to $34.612 billion.  Bank of England  The Bank of England should restart its asset-purchase
program to prevent persistent slow economic growth, said  Adam Posen , a policy maker, in a speech today in Hull, England.  U.S. debt securities were supported as investors speculated
that the ballooning cost of rescuing Dublin-based Anglo Irish
Bank Corp. will force Ireland’s government to choose between
fully repaying senior bondholders and tackling the region’s
biggest budget deficit.  Credit-default swaps tied to Irish bonds jumped as much as
30.5 basis points to 521.5 after more than doubling in the past
two months, and were at 496 basis points as of 1:40 p.m. in
London, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Anglo Irish
rose 1.5 basis points to 937.5, implying a 56 percent
probability of default within five years, after earlier climbing
to an all-time high of 960.5.  Ten-year Treasuries have returned 14.3 percent this year
and 4.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The S&P 500 Index has increased
11 percent since the end of June.  “The market’s not trading on relative value,” said  John Fath , a principal at BTG Pactual in New York. “When you’re
buying five-year notes at 1.25, you’re thinking the Fed’s on
hold for three or four years.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
