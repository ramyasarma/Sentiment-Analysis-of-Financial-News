South Africa’s planned 5,000
megawatt solar energy park, which will be the world’s largest if
built, could create as many as 12,300 jobs, Minister of Energy
 Dipuo Peters  said.  The project, which may be built at Upington in the nation’s
Northern Cape province, is ideal for the establishment of a
solar park because of intense solar radiation for much of the
year, she told reporters in Johannesburg today.  A pre-feasibility study has been completed and South Africa
could start talks with investors as soon as early 2011, Ompi
Aphane, deputy Director General at the Department of Energy,
said at the same briefing.  South Africa is battling a power shortage after the
government halted expansion plans by state-owned electricity
producer Eskom Holdings Ltd. for four years until 2004 while it
tried and failed to convince companies to build power plants.  Initial estimates indicate that the planned solar plant
could cost about 150 billion rand ($21.1 billion), government
spokesman  Themba Maseko  said in Cape Town on Sept. 16.  Eskom is planning a 100 megawatt solar thermal energy
project, also in Upington. The plant, which received funding
from the World Bank, is expected to be completed by 2014.  The largest solar power plant currently in operation is a 64
megawatt solar thermal energy project at Nevada in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
