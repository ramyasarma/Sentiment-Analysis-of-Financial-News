Croatian Finance Minister  Ivan Suker  may be fired as part of Prime Minister  Jadranka Kosor ’s
drive to prepare the country for European Union entry,  Jutarnji
List  reported, without citing anyone.  Kosor’s plan to shuffle her cabinet, announced yesterday in
New York, is part of a drive to reduce corruption and improve
efficiency to help Croatia become the next EU member in 2012,
said  Branko Bacic , the chief secretary of the ruling  Croatian
Democratic Union , according to the Zagreb newspaper.  Suker has been criticized for failing to read a contract
between the government and  Mol Nyrt ., the Hungarian refiner in
control of Croatian oil company  INA Industrija nafte d.d .,
before voting in favor of it, according to Jutarnji.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
