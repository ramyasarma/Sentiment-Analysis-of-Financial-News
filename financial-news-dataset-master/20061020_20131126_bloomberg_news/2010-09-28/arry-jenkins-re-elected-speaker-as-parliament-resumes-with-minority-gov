Harry Jenkins has been re-elected
as the speaker for Australia’s House of Representatives.  Prime Minister Julia Gillard congratulated Jenkins on his
re-election immediately following the motion.  Jenkins’ election comes on the first day of parliament
following the Aug. 21 election when none of the two major
parties achieved enough votes to form a majority government.
Gillard is governing with the support of several independent
lawmakers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
