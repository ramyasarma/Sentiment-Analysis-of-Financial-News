Blackpool manager Ian Holloway was
charged with improper conduct by England’s Football Association
after his outburst at officials following a 2-1 loss against
Blackburn last weekend.  The charge comes from his language and behavior toward
referees after the Sept. 25 home match, the F.A. said today on
its website. Holloway, who has until Oct. 1 to respond, was
given a two-match ban last season because of improper conduct
against officials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
