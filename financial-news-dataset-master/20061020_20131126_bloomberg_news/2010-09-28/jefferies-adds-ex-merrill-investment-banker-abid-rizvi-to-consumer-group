Jefferies Group Inc. , the
securities firm that increased staff 30 percent in 20 months,
hired Abid Rizvi, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in
consumer products, to be a managing director in the global
mergers and acquisitions group.  Rizvi has 15 years of investment-banking experience and was
most recently a managing director at Sagent Advisors, according
to a statement today from New York-based Jefferies. He was at
Merrill Lynch for nine years.  Rizvi’s “relationships with a broad range of consumer-
product companies and his deep knowledge of the consumer market
will significantly expand our M&A presence in this sector,”
 John Huwiler , head of mergers and acquisitions, said in the
statement.  Jefferies has increased staff to pick up capacity from
failed investment banks and profit from a recovery in the
financial-services industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
