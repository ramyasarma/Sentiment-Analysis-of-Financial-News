Toyota Motor Corp.  will introduce
new models in China to boost sales in the world’s largest
automarket, according to researcher J.D. Power & Associates.  Toyota plans to make its Verso and Wish compact minivans
in China with local partners in 2011, and will also import the
luxury Alphard, a larger minivan,  Marvin Zhu , a senior analyst
at J.D. Power, said in a report this month. The Verso will be
produced with  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co . in Guangdong
province, while the Wish will be manufactured with China FAW
Group Corp, Shanghai-based Zhu said.  While  Niu Yu , a Beijing-based spokesman for Toyota, said he
couldn’t comment on 2011 vehicle releases, he confirmed the
Alphard will be imported from Japan later this year.  Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, and rivals including
 General Motors Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co.  are adding models in
China as economic growth boosts car-buying. Passenger-car
deliveries accelerated in August, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said Sept. 9, and sales in the nation
are on course to outstrip the U.S. for a second year.  Toyota sold 510,952 vehicles in China between January and
August, an increase of 34 percent compared with a year earlier,
the J.D. Power said.  Shares of the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker fell 0.7
percent to 3,075 yen in Tokyo.  -- Liza Lin . Editors:  Ian Rowley ,  Kae Inoue   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
