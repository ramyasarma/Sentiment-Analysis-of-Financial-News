First Bank of Nigeria Plc can’t
meet its target of 10 percent growth in loans this year,
investor relations head Yemisi Lanre-Phillips said.  “It’s been a challenge growing the loan book this year,”
she said in a speech in Lagos today. The bank plans to achieve 5
percent year-on-year growth and has reached 2 percent, she said.  First Bank expects its loan book to increase by 20 percent
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
