Consol Glass (Pty) Ltd., a South
African glass maker, entered into a 750 million-rand, three-year
working-capital facility with Nedbank Ltd.  The manufacturer of the material also extended its hedging
arrangement on its 7.625 percent senior secured notes due April
2014, the Germiston-based company said in an e-mailed statement
dated yesterday. The hedge will run until April 2014, when the
notes mature, compared with April 2011. The agreement includes a
coupon payment on the notes and the 372.5 million euros
principal due.  Consol will pay 47 million rand of the mark-to-market value
of 1.43 billion rand as at Sept. 22 from cash resources, with
the rest deferred to April 2014.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
