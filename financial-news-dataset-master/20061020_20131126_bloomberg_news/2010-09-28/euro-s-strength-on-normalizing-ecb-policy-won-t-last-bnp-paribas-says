Gains by the euro probably won’t
last as investors bet that a general improvement in money and
credit data masks differences within the region, according to
BNP Paribas SA.  “There are still huge regional divergences in the data,
with the vast majority of the liquidity still being pumped into
the periphery of Europe,” analysts led by  Hans-Guenter Redeker ,
London-based global head of foreign-exchange strategy at BNP,
wrote in a note today. “Any euro strength on the back of the
prospect of European Central Bank policy normalization is
likely to be short lived.”  The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3470 as of 2 p.m. in
London, leaving it 1.5 percent stronger over the past week.  Europe’s common currency rose after ECB Executive Board
Member Juergen Stark told reporters in Istanbul that the ECB is
progressing with its exit from non-standard policy measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
