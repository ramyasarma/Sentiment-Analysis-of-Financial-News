India, the world’s second-biggest
cooking oil consumer, may extend duty-free imports of crude palm
and soybean oils by a further 12 months as it seeks to control
domestic prices, two government officials said.  A group of ministers may consider the proposal from the
food ministry as early as today, said the officials, who
declined to be identified as the information isn’t public.  India abolished the import duty on crude palm oil in April
2008, and in March 2009 scrapped a 20 percent levy on purchases
of crude soybean oil. Both measures are due for review Sept. 30.  The country buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and
soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
