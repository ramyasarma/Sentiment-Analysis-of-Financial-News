Spain auctioned 3 billion euros ($4
billion) of Treasury bills at rising borrowing costs as a
decision by Moody’s Investors Service on lowering the country’s
credit rating looms.  Spain sold 1.17 billion euros of three-month bills at an
average yield of 0.685 percent, compared with 0.624 percent at
the last auction on Aug. 24. It sold 1.81 billion euros of six-
month bills at a yield of 1.18 percent, compared with 1.037
percent in August, the Bank of Spain said. It had set a maximum
target for the auction of 3.5 billion euros.  Moody’s said on June 30 it may cut Spain’s Aaa rating when
it completes a review within three months. The government is
also due to announce its borrowing plan for 2011 on Sept. 30 as
it presents to parliament the most austere budget in three
decades, which aims to cut the  deficit  in half in two years.  “There is a risk of a two-notch move, or one-notch with
some warnings that they could go lower is feasible,” said
 Harvinder Sian , a senior bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in London. “A two-notch probably isn’t priced
in.”  The  spread  on Spanish 10-year debt rose to 191 basis points
at 11:14 a.m. in Madrid, compared with 187 basis points
yesterday. The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Portuguese
and Irish debt surged to euro-era records today, increasing
pressure on Spain.  Fitch Ratings cut Spain to AA+ on May 28, citing concerns
over economic growth. Standard & Poor’s ranks the nation AA
after stripping Spain of the top rating in January 2009.  Moody’s Downgrades  Moody’s downgraded Greece on June 14 by four steps to non-
investment grade, citing “substantial” risks to economic
growth from austerity measures tied to a 110 billion-euro
European Union-led aid package. The company cut Portugal’s
rating on July 13 by two notches to A1. S&P cut Ireland to AA on
Aug. 24, its third cut in two years, citing the possible costs
of supporting the nation’s financial sector.  Spain’s cabinet approved on Sept. 24 the 2011 budget, which
aims to reduce spending 3 percent compared with this year and
includes an increase in income tax on workers earning more than
120,000 euros a year. The plan goes to parliament on Sept. 30
where Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero needs to win
votes from smaller parties to pass the plan. The country’s two
largest unions are planning a general strike on Sept. 29, to
protest the austerity measures and changes to labor law.  The Socialist government aims to cut the  budget shortfall 
to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 11.1 percent
last year, bringing it within the European Union’s 3 percent
limit in 2013. To achieve the reduction, the government is
cutting public wages 5 percent this year, raising taxes,
reducing spending on infrastructure and freezing pensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
