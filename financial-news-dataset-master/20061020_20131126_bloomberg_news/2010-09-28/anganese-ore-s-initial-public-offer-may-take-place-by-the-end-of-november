Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. , the
nation’s largest producer, expects to sell shares by the end of
November, Finance Director M.A.V. Goutham said today.  The company  filed a prospectus with the market regulator
for the sale of 33.6 million shares through a so-called book
building process yesterday, Goutham said in a phone interview.
He declined to say how much the company expects to raise from
the sale.  “The process of approvals and other formalities may take
about a month or two and the share sale can be expected in the
last week of November,” Goutham said.  India’s cabinet approved the company’s initial public offer
on Sept. 9 as part of a plan to sell state assets. The federal
government will sell a 10 percent stake, while the state
governments of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will sell 5
percent each in the company. Manganese Ore’s IPO may coincide
with a share sale from state-owned miner  Hindustan Copper Ltd. ,
which also filed its prospectus yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Edelweiss Capital Ltd. and IDBI
Capital Market Services Ltd. will manage Manganese Ore’s public
offer, Goutham said on Aug. 18. The sale may raise about 15
billion rupees, two people with direct knowledge of the matter
said July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
