Chile’s peso rose to a 27-month
high after a report showed the country’s  industrial growth 
accelerated to the fastest since 2006.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 485.23 per U.S. dollar
at 11:43 a.m. New York time, from 486.17 yesterday. The currency
touched 483.61, the strongest since June 11, 2008. The peso has
risen 13 percent during the quarter and 3.6 percent this month.  Chile’s economy is accelerating after the fifth-largest
earthquake in a century struck in February, delaying its
recovery from a 2009 recession.  “Retail sales grew and industrial production was better
than expected,” said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at Barclays
Capital in New York.  Retail sales expanded 13 percent in August from a year
earlier, and industrial output grew 6.9 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said in Santiago. That’s the most since
January 2006. Industrial production shrank 17 percent after the
8.8-magnitude Feb. 27 earthquake and its accompanying tsunami,
which caused damage worth more than a sixth of Chile’s gross
domestic product.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
