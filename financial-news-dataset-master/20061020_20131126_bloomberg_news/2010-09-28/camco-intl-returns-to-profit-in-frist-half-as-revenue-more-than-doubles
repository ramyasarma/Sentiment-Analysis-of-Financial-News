Camco International Ltd. , the U.K.
manager of carbon-reduction projects whose biggest shareholder
is a fund linked to  Al Gore , swung to a profit in the first half
as revenue more than doubled.  Net income was 133,000 euros ($178,000) in the six months
through June, compared with a net loss of 18.3 million euros in
the year-earlier period, the St. Helier, Jersey-based company
said today in a statement.  It received United Nations credits for 4.3 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide, compared with 1 million tons a year
earlier. Revenue jumped to 11 million euros from 5 million
euros.  Camco yesterday rose 24 percent in London trading, the most
since May 2009, after announcing a venture with the investment
holding arm of the Malaysian government to expand its carbon-
trading and renewable energy operations in Asia. It is down 40
percent from a year ago as the recession sapped demand for
emission credits and UN regulators clamped down on supply of new
credits that the company relies on for revenue.  Camco  was unchanged today at 18 pence, valuing the company
at 31.7 million pounds ($50.06 million).  Generation IM Climate Solution Fund LP owns about 18.3
percent of Camco’s  shares  and is its biggest holder, Bloomberg
data show. The fund is managed by Generation Investment
Management LLP, which is chaired by Gore, the climate campaigner
and former U.S. vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
