Yuan forwards dropped the most in
two months, snapping an eight-day run of gains, on speculation
the government will temper appreciation to protect exports.  China’s central bank set the reference rate at 6.7051 per
dollar, from 6.7098 yesterday. That’s the second day in a row
that the monetary authority fixed the rate weaker than 6.7,
after allowing it to rise above that level on Sept. 21 for the
first time since a dollar peg was scrapped in July 2005.  “The fixings show the fast appreciation which we’ve seen
in the last three weeks has come to an end,” said  Liu Dongliang ,
a Shenzhen-based analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
country’s sixth-largest lender by market value. “If the yuan
climbs too fast, Chinese exporters won’t be able to cope with
it.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.28 percent to
6.5788 per dollar as of 5:38 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets
the currency will strengthen 1.8 percent in a year’s time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yuan’s spot rate
was little changed at 6.6906, from 6.6923 yesterday.  The yuan has gained 1.5 percent in the past 11 trading days
before the U.S. House of Representatives considers legislation
this week that would let companies petition for higher duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effects of a weak
Chinese currency.  China may retaliate against U.S. businesses operating in
the country if Congress passes legislation intended to force a
revaluation of the yuan,  Robert Roche , the chairman of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said at a briefing in
Washington yesterday.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
