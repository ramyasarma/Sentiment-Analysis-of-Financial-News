OAO Lukoil  and  China National
Petroleum Corp . plan to expand cooperation on exploration and
production in Central Asia and may swap assets in Russia and
China as they each seek to expand internationally.  The two companies will also discuss fuel supplies to China,
under a partnership accord signed yesterday during Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to Beijing, Lukoil said in a
statement. The accord covers Lukoil and CNPC’s Kumkol and
Severnye Buzachi developments in Kazakhstan and the Aral gas
project Uzbekistan, and expands on a 2007 agreement.  China has turned to Central Asia for gas supplies as talks
on deliveries from Russia, which has the world’s largest
reserves, remain deadlocked over prices. China has begun to
import fuel from Turkmenistan, holder of the world’s fourth
largest reserves, via a pipeline through Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan that was completed late last year.  Lukoil and CNPC said the Aral venture, which includes
Uzbekneftegaz as a partner, found natural gas in June. Lukoil
has additional projects in Uzbekistan from which it expects to
produce up to 15 billion cubic meters a year of gas.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
