India’s 10-year  bonds  rose, pushing
their yield to the lowest level in six weeks, on speculation the
 central bank  will temper the pace of interest-rate increases
after boosting borrowing costs five times this year.  The securities climbed for a seventh day, the longest
winning streak for a benchmark note since November, after the
finance ministry on Sept. 23 cut debt sales for the fiscal year
ending March by 2 percent to 4.47 trillion rupees ($99 billion)
and relaxed limits on foreign holdings of India’s bonds. The
central bank increased the  repurchase auction rate , at which it
lends to banks, by 25 basis points to 6 percent from Sept. 17.  “The Reserve Bank may go slow on the interest rate
front,” said  Mukesh Kumar , a fixed-income trader at State Bank
of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “The reduction in the borrowing
program is also positive for bonds as it reflects improved
government finances.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 fell one
basis point to 7.85 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price rose
0.03, or 3 paise, per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.63.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, fell two basis points to 6.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
