Citigroup Inc. has set up new China
desks in its offices in Europe, Africa and the Americas to
better serve the bank’s Chinese corporate clients.  The move is “in response to the continuing shift in trade
and investment flows into and out of China” and will “allow
Citi to more efficiently serve Chinese companies as they expand
overseas,” the bank said in an e-mailed press release today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
