Treasuries  remained higher as the
government’s $35 billion sale of five-year notes drew the lowest
yield since the government began quarterly sales of the
securities in 1976.  The auction drew a yield of 1.260 percent, compared with
the 1.276 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
8 of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers. Treasuries rose
earlier after a drop in U.S. consumer confidence spurred
speculation that the Fed will increase purchases of U.S. debt to
boost the economy.  “It’s a fairly receptive environment for Treasury
securities,”  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.6 billion as
chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union
in New York, said before the auction. “We have intimations that
the Federal Reserve will reinstate quantitative easing. We’ll
have a very slow, moderate, below-trend expansion for a fair
amount of time.”  Current five-year note  yields  slid 6 basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.23 percent at 1:07 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 10-year  note yield 
dropped 7 basis points to 2.46 percent.  The sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.96, compared with an average of 2.74 at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 50.1 percent of the notes, compared
with 50.8 percent at the last auction on Aug. 25 and an average
of 46 percent at the past 10 sales. Five-year notes drew a then
record-low yield of 1.374 percent at last month’s auction.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.7 percent,
matching the share in August.  The size of the five-year offering today was the smallest
since May 2009. The Treasury will auction $29 billion in seven-
year debt tomorrow, after selling $36 billion in two-year
securities yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
