Leaders of Group of 20 nations must
build a “more harmonized” global currency system to prevent
the risk of competitive devaluations, said  Jacques de Larosiere ,
author of a European report into the roots of the financial
crisis.  “We have an international monetary system that doesn’t
function well,” de Larosiere, the former head of the
International Monetary Fund and the Bank of France, said today
in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Brussels. “It’s a
real concern.”  Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday that
a “currency war” has begun, with nations seeking to lower the
value of their currencies to bolster exports. Japan this month
broke a six-month policy by selling yen, joining countries
across Asia and Latin America that have tempered gains in their
currencies against the dollar in a move that drew criticism from
the U.S. and euro area.  Today’s international monetary system “is a regime where
people intervene on the markets to peg their currencies more or
less to some others,” de Larosiere said. Monetary policies
leading to a “beggar-thy-neighbor attitude” are “very
dangerous,” de Larosiere said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
