Argentina may sell bonds paying 8
percent interest to finance infrastructure projects, President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  told businessmen in New York,
according to  Ambito Financiero .  Argentina may issue the bonds after reaching an agreement
with the Paris Club group of creditor nations, the Buenos Aires-
based financial newspaper reported, without saying how it
obtained the information. The debt would be used for projects
included in the 2011 budget, the paper said.  The government sent the budget to Congress this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
