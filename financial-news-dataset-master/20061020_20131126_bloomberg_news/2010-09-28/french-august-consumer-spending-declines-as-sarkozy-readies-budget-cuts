French consumer spending fell in
August as President  Nicolas Sarkozy  readied budget cuts and an
overhaul of the retirement system, prompting households to cut
back on purchases.  Spending dropped 1.6 percent in the month, after a 2.7
percent increase in July, national statistics office Insee said
today in a statement from Paris. Economists expected a drop of
0.2 percent, according to the median of 11 forecasts gathered by
Bloomberg News.  Sarkozy, whose government is raising the retirement age,
will this week present a budget that will slash the deficit by
the most since at least 1991 by closing tax loopholes and
limiting expenditure. The effort comes as jobless claims hold at
2.69 million, near the five-year high of 2.7 million reached in
May, following France’s worst recession since World War II.  “The pension reform is looming and the budget tightening
is under way and consumers are unlikely to escape that,” said
 Joost Beaumont , an economist at ABN Amro Bank NV in Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
