The  U.S. Supreme Court  agreed to
hear an appeal by drugmakers seeking to block thousands of
public hospitals and community health clinics from suing for
violations of a federal program that lets them buy medicines at
a discount.  The justices today granted review to an appeal by companies
including units of  Pfizer Inc. ,  Merck & Co.  and  Sanofi-Aventis
SA . The companies are challenging a lower court ruling
permitting a suit against the drugmakers filed by the California
county of Santa Clara.  Chief Justice  John Roberts , who previously had disqualified
himself from cases involving Pfizer because he owned stock in
the company, took part in today’s order. Roberts sold his Pfizer
shares last month, Supreme Court spokeswoman  Kathy Arberg  said.  The dispute centers on the rights of 14,500 health
providers that collectively spend about $4 billion a year on
outpatient drugs. A 2006 government report found that those
providers overpaid by $3.9 million during one month.  A San Francisco-based federal appeals court said the
providers can sue to enforce a contract between the drugmakers
and the federal government. The companies said the federal law
governing the discount program doesn’t authorize private suits.  The legal issues are similar to those that have led to
suits -- and hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements --
over the way drugmakers price their products for Medicaid, the
government health care program for the poor.  The case is Astra USA v. County of Santa Clara, 09-1273.  To contact the reporter on this story:
