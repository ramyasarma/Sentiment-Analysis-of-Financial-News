Gold holdings in exchange-traded
products may climb between 10 percent and 20 percent for each of
the next two years, said  Gerry Schubert , head of precious metals
at ABN Amro Markets (U.K.) Ltd.  Bullion held via 10  ETP  providers reached a record 2,089.74
metric tons on Sept. 22, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. That
almost equaled the combined official reserves of China and
Switzerland, based on figures from the World Gold Council. Gold,
which rose to a record yesterday, may advance as high as $2,000
an ounce within the next 12 months, Schubert said.  ETPs “are a great vehicle to invest in gold without
putting the burden on you to hold it physically,” Schubert said
yesterday in an interview at the London Bullion Market
Association’s Precious Metals Conference 2010 in Berlin. “The
banking crisis is not over. We still have sovereign-risk
issues.”  Gold is headed for a 10th straight annual gain, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920. Bullion has outperformed
global equities, Treasuries and most industrial metals,
prompting record investments in gold-backed ETPs. The metal
rallied as central banks and governments kept borrowing costs
low and spent trillions of dollars to stimulate their economies.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,292.35 an ounce at
6:19 a.m. in London and is up 18 percent this year. Prices
reached a record $1,300.15 yesterday.  While gold is bought to protect wealth, an economic
recovery is unlikely to spur sales of ETP assets, Schubert said,
adding that funds are starting to boost investment in such
products. Gold may rise to between $1,700 and $2,000 an ounce by
the time the LBMA holds its next annual conference in September
2011, he said.  “We need several points to come together for investors to
consider liquidating part of their positions,” Schubert said.
Bullion “should form part of your insurance,” and only very-
short-term-oriented hedge funds may sell ETP holdings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
