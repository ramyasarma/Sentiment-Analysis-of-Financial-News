Energy traders expect increased
enforcement actions and audits from regulators, according to a
study released today.  Almost 80 percent believe that agencies like the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission will step up enforcement activity, according to a
 survey  of 140 energy trading representatives commissioned by
 NICE Systems Ltd. ’s Actimize unit and Fulbright & Jaworski LLP.  The  Dodd-Frank Act , signed into law in July, expands
oversight to the over-the-counter market and requires regulators
to impose position limits on commodities including oil, natural
gas and gasoline. Many of the rules will go into effect within
the next year.  “We are at an inflection point in the energy trading
industry,” said  Erik J.A. Swenson , a partner at Fulbright &
Jaworski, in a statement. “The regulatory requirements and
oversight expectations have increased, but the industry is
challenged with how to respond to the evolving expectations.”  The survey found that nearly 40 percent of respondents
found the industry’s readiness to comply with new regulations
acceptable or better, while nearly 42 percent rated it
“somewhat acceptable.”  Ra’Anana, Israel-based Nice sells compliance programs to
the financial industry designed to detect risk, financial crime
and compliance. Fulbright & Jaworski is an oil and gas law firm
in Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
