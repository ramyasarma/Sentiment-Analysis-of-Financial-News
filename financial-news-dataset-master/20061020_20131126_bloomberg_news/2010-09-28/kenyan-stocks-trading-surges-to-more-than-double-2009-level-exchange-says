The value of stock traded in  Kenya ,
Africa’s second best-performing market, is more than double that
for 2009, the Nairobi Stock Exchange said.  With three months to go to the end of the year, the
exchange has traded equities worth 77.16 billion shillings
($952.48 million) compared with 38.16 billion shillings for the
whole of last year, Donald Ouma, the head of product and market
development at the bourse, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  “We have surpassed our 2010 targets,” Ouma said, without
providing further details.  The 55-member Nairobi All-Share Index, which has risen 43
percent this year, is the second-best performing measure in
Africa after  Uganda’s index , which has surged 50 percent.  The value of bonds traded in East Africa’s biggest economy
is 361.19 billion shillings since the start of the year,
compared with 110.65 billion shillings for 2009, he said.  The Kenyan  All-Share Index  snapped three days of losses,
rising 0.2 percent to 82.93 by 2:56 p.m. in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
