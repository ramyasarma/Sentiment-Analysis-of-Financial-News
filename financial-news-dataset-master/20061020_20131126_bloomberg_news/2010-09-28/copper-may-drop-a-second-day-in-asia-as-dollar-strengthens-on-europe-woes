Copper, little changed, may decline
for a second day as the dollar strengthened against the euro on
mounting concern that Europe’s debt crisis is escalating. Zinc
and aluminum declined.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $7,872 a metric ton
before trading at $7,900 at 10:30 a.m. Singapore time. January-
delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost as much as
0.9 percent to 60,120 yuan ($8,983) a ton before trading little
changed at 60,540 yuan.  “In the near term, as worries about Europe resurface, the
dollar will likely strengthen against the euro and weigh on
metals prices,”  Zhang Fang , an analyst at China Securities Co.,
said from Beijing.  The dollar  gained against the euro before reports today
that economists forecast will show German consumer prices
declined and French household spending dropped. The euro, which
weakened to $1.3445 from a five-month high yesterday, also
retreated as Ireland will disclose this week the final costs of
bailing out Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  Aluminum in London dropped 0.3 percent to $2,287 a ton,
zinc declined 0.6 percent to $2,195 a ton and lead fell 0.2
percent to $2,265 a ton. Nickel lost 0.3 percent to $23,015 a
ton, while tin hadn’t traded by 10:31 a.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
