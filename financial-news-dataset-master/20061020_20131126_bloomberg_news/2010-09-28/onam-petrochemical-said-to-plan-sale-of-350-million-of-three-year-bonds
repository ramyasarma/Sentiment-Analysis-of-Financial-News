Honam Petrochemical Corp. , South
Korea’s second-largest ethylene maker, plans to raise $350
million from a sale of floating-rate notes, according to three
people familiar with the matter.  The U.S.-dollar denominated bonds will have a maturity of
three years, said two of the people who asked not to be named
before a public announcement.  Seoul-based Honam also priced 300 billion won ($261
million) of five-year local currency bonds to yield 49 basis
points more than similar-maturity government debt, said two of
the people.  The ethylene producer plans to buy Malaysia’s  Titan
Chemicals Corp.  in an all-cash deal valued at $1.25 billion,
both companies said in July. While Honam has enough cash
reserves to finance the Titan acquisition, it may raise some
funds in the market, Roger Lee, a company spokesman, said by
telephone at the time, without specifying whether it would be
through debt or equity.  Officials at the company’s finance team were out of the
office when Bloomberg News called for comment today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
