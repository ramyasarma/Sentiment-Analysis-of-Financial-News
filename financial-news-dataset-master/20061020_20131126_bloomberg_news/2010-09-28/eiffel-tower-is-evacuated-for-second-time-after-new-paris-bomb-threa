Paris police today evacuated the
city’s landmark Eiffel Tower for the second time in a month,
following a bomb threat.  A telephone call to the tower’s operator, later traced to a
telephone booth near the monument, warned that a bomb had been
placed on the premises, a Paris police spokeswoman said in a
telephone interview.  Television channel TF1 said at 8:10 p.m. in Paris that the
alert was over without incident, citing unidentified City Hall
officials.  The Eiffel Tower was evacuated on Sept. 14 after a similar
warning. A police search found no evidence of a bomb.   To contact the reporter on this story:
