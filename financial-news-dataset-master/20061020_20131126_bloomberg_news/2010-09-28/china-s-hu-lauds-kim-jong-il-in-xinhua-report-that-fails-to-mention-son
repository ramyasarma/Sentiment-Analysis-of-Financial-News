China’s President Hu Jintao
congratulated Kim Jong Il on his re-election as North Korea’s
leader in a Xinhua report that made no mention of the naming of
Kim’s youngest son to key military and party posts.  Hu extended his “warm congratulations” on the holding of
the Workers’ Party of Korea meeting, Xinhua said, the biggest
such gathering in 30 years. China will continue to strengthen
ties with North Korea “to a higher level,” Hu said.  Kim Jong Un, Kim’s youngest son, was appointed to the
ruling party’s second-highest military post at the meeting, the
official Korean Central News Agency said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
