Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
favors Chinese steel companies to non-ferrous metal producers,
given the outlook for product prices amid production cuts
spurred by the nation’s efforts to reduce energy consumption.  The brokerage raised its rating for Maanshan Iron and Steel
Co. to “buy” from “neutral” and for Shanxi Taigang Stainless
Steel Co. to “buy” from “sell,” according to a report by Jim
Hung and Rowena Chang. They also raised Jiangxi Copper Co.’s
recommendation to “neutral” from “sell.” The analysts
lowered Angang Steel Co., China Molybdenum Co. and Jinduicheng
Molybdenum Co. to “neutral” from “buy” and cut Jilin Ji En
Nickel Industry Co. to “sell” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
