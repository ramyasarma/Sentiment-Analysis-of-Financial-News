Mild-tasting coffee used by
Starbucks Corp. and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. is
poised to cheapen versus its bitter-tasting competitor as
production of so-called arabica beans increases to a record.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the premium of arabica over
robusta widened 61 percent in the past year to $2,282.61 a
metric ton as investors raised bets on concern rains in Colombia,
the biggest grower of the variety after Brazil, would damage the
crop. That’s almost double the average $1,286.13 a ton since
January 2008, when a new contract started trading in London.  “The speculative premium on arabica should decline in the
fourth quarter, as the upcoming harvests in Colombia and Central
America should reduce current supply bottlenecks in high-quality
arabica beans,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG
in Frankfurt, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  The arabica coffee harvest will surge 14 percent to 85.95
million bags in 2010-2011, from a year ago, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. That would be more than double the
6.4 percent expansion for robusta beans, according to the USDA.
Stockpiles in warehouses  monitored  by ICE Futures U.S. fell 41
percent in the past year to 1.97 million bags, the lowest level
in more than a decade.  Colombia’s main harvest begins in October, according to the
USDA, which  forecast  the nation will represent 10 percent of the
world’s global arabica output in 2010-2011. Total coffee
production will exceed demand by 8.2 million bags in 2010-2011,
compared with a deficit of 3 million bags in the prior season,
according to USDA data. Each bag weighs 60 kilograms.  “The extreme nature of the cost increases has made it
untenable for us to continue” to absorb them, Starbucks said
Sept. 22, when it announced an increase in some prices.
Additional commodity costs, primarily from coffee, will be about
4 cents a share in the year ending in September 2011, the
Seattle-based company said in August while affirming its July 21
forecast for the period of $1.36 to $1.41 a share.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
