U.S. stocks advanced, erasing most
of yesterday’s drop, as  Walgreen Co.  led a rally in consumer-
staples and health companies and investors speculated the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to safeguard the economy.  Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, jumped 11
percent as earnings topped estimates. Pfizer Inc. and  Johnson &
Johnson  paced gains in health-care shares as the Supreme Court
agreed to hear an appeal by pharmaceutical companies seeking to
block thousands of public hospitals from suing over a federal
discount-drug program. Monsanto Co. slid 8.1 percent on concern
its SmartStax corn seeds aren’t performing as well as predicted.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.5 percent to
1,147.70 at 4 p.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 0.9
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 46.10 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 10,858.14.  “Investors are getting more comfortable with taking some
risk as it sounds like the Fed’s goal is to increase
inflation,” said  Eric Green , director of research at Penn
Capital Management in Philadelphia, which oversees $5 billion.
“If the economy doesn’t get better, there seems to be a belief
the Fed is going to stimulate through purchases. If it does get
better, that’s good for stocks also.”  The  S&P 500  has rallied about 9 percent since the end of
August, poised for its best month since April 2009 and its
biggest September rally since 1939, as concern eased that
Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. unemployment will derail the
economic rebound. Stocks and Treasuries also have gained on
speculation the Fed will buy more U.S. government debt to keep
interest rates low in a practice known as quantitative easing.  Fed Hints  The Fed announced after its Sept. 21 meeting that it’s
prepared to do more to help the economy, spurring speculation
policy makers will add Treasury securities to the central bank’s
holdings. The central bank today purchased $550 million of
Treasury Inflation Protected securities as part of a program to
reinvest principal payments on its mortgage holdings into long-
term government debt.  A bigger-than-estimated decrease in consumer confidence
helped fuel speculation of another round of quantitative easing.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index declined to
48.5, lower than forecast, from 53.2 the prior month. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
decline to 52.1.  Walgreen surged 11 percent to $33.81. The company’s fourth-
quarter earnings were 53 cents a share excluding items such as
costs related to the Duane Reade  acquisition , beating the 44-
cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Rival CVS
Caremark Corp. climbed 2.7 percent to $31.45.  Health-Care Gains  Pfizer  advanced 1.5 percent to $17.43. Johnson & Johnson
rose 0.6 percent to $62.43. All but 5 of the 51 health-care
stocks in the S&P 500 advanced, sending the group to the biggest
advance among 10 industries.  The high court agreed to hear an appeal by drugmakers
seeking to block hospitals and clinics from suing for violations
of a federal program that lets them buy medicines at a discount.
The court granted review to an appeal by companies including
units of Pfizer,  Merck & Co.  and Sanofi-Aventis SA. The
drugmakers are challenging a lower court ruling permitting a
suit filed by the California county of Santa Clara.  Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. rallied 8.1 percent to
$33.10 after rising to $34.26 earlier, the highest intraday
price since August 2007. The drugmaker agreed to buy Qualitest
Pharmaceuticals, a closely held U.S. generic-drug maker, for
about $1.2 billion in cash from private-equity firm Apax
Partners LLP.  Broadwind Surges  Broadwind Energy Inc. surged 27 percent to $1.87 on
speculation General Electric Co. will acquire the maker of wind
towers, according to Raymond James & Associates equity analyst
 Pavel Molchanov . General Electric, the world’s second-biggest
maker of wind turbines, said yesterday it formed a joint venture
with China’s Harbin Power Equipment Co. to make and supply
equipment in the world’s biggest market.  Amedisys Inc. dropped 16 percent to $24.02 for the  biggest 
retreat in the Russell 2000 Index. The largest U.S. home-nursing
provider was asked by federal prosecutors for information
related to Medicare reimbursements and billing claims by its 31
Alabama home-health operations.  Monsanto  fell 8.1 percent to $48.75, bringing its two-day
drop to 12 percent, the most since 2008. Initial field data on
Monsanto’s SmartStax genetically modified corn showed weaker-
than-expected performance, Jefferies Group Inc. said in a note.
Separately, Australia’s Nufarm Ltd. reported 2010 North American
sales of glyphosate, a herbicide also sold by Monsanto, fell 44
percent year over year.  ‘Panic’ Levels  Investors’ sentiment on U.S. stocks has fallen to “panic”
levels, an indication that the equity market will rise over the
next 6 to 12 months, according to  Tobias Levkovich  at Citigroup
Inc. Citigroup’s Panic/Euphoria Model declined to as low as
minus 0.49 this month. In March 2009, the gauge had dropped to
minus 0.46, when the S&P 500 started a rally of as much as 80
percent on governmental efforts to stimulate the economy.  The measure had fallen to minus 0.36 on October 2002, when
the S&P 500 entered a five-year rally to its record high of
1,565.15 in October 2007.  “If you break below the panic line, there’s a 90 percent
probability that stocks will be up in six months,” Levkovich,
Citigroup’s New York-based chief U.S. equity strategist, said in
a telephone interview. “There’s about a 97 percent probability
that stocks will be up 12 months later.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
