Pershing Square Capital Management
LP and Winthrop Realty Trust lost their bid to halt an upcoming
foreclosure sale of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village
apartment complex in Manhattan, according to a New York state
appeals court clerk.  A New York appeals court declined a request by Pershing and
Winthrop for a stay of the Oct. 4 foreclosure planned by senior
debt holders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
