Reliance Industries Ltd. , owner of
the world’s largest oil refining complex, is operating both its
oil refineries “normally” at its Jamnagar facility in India.  “Jamnagar is operating normally,”  Manoj Warrier , a
company spokesman, said by phone from Mumbai. Both refineries in
the complex are producing at full capacity, he said.  Reuters reported today that half of a 660,000 barrel-a-day
refinery was shut for about a month citing traders it didn’t
identify.  Reliance’s Jamnagar facility located in India’s western
state of Gujarat is centered on two refineries, a 580,000
barrel-a-day plant that was completed in December 2008 and the
older unit, part of which was said to have shut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
