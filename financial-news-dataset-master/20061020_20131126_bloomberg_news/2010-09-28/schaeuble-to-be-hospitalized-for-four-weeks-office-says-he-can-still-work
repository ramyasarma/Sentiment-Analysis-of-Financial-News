German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble will return to the hospital for about four weeks
because of pressure sores related to his confinement to a
wheelchair, the Finance Ministry said.  Schaeuble, who spent several weeks in the hospital earlier
this year, is suffering from inflamations that require
treatment, ministry spokesman Michael Offer said today in a
statement.  “The experiences of the spring showed that he can also
carry out his duties from the hospital,” Offer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
