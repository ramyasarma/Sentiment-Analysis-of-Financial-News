The Polish zloty slid for a second
day on concern European governments will struggle to reduce
deficits after Irish and Portuguese bonds plunged.  The zloty declined 0.5 percent to 3.9731 per euro as of
5:36 p.m. in Warsaw. It slid the most among nine currencies in
Eastern Europe and Africa tracked by Bloomberg.  Irish and Portuguese bonds fell, sending the yield premium
investors demand to hold the securities over benchmark German
bunds to records. The cost of insuring against default on
Ireland’s government debt surged to a record as Standard &
Poor’s said the price of bailing out nationalized lender Anglo
Irish Bank Corp. could exceed $47 billion.  “We have the same old story of European debt concern now
with Ireland coming to the fore,” said  Gaelle Blanchard , an
emerging-market strategist at Societe Generale SA in London.
“This is looking like a recurring theme.”  Poland’s  general government deficit  this year may widen to
about 8 percent of gross domestic product before narrowing to
about 6 percent next year, PAP newswire reported yesterday,
citing an unnamed person at the Prime Minister’s Office. The
deficit reached 7.1 percent in 2009.  The deficit “confirms that the government is treading a
fine line and will have to increase efforts to persuade markets
of sustainability of public finances,” BNP Paribas SA emerging-
market strategists wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
