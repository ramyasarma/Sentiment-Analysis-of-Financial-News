Michigan State University  football
coach  Mark Dantonio  said he’ll watch this week’s game against
the University of Wisconsin from the press box, two weeks after
suffering a heart attack.  “I’m going to ease back into this much like anybody would
after any injury,” Dantonio, 54, said today at a  news
conference.   Dantonio was admitted to a hospital in Lansing, Michigan,
in the early morning of Sept. 19 -- hours after the Spartans
beat Notre Dame 34-31 in overtime -- and had a stent inserted to
open a blocked blood vessel leading to his heart.  The fourth-year coach said walking on the sideline for
three hours may be too tiring, so he’ll instead watch from the
press box as Michigan State welcomes Wisconsin, which is ranked
ninth in the national coaches’ poll. Both teams are 4-0.  “We don’t discuss injuries, so why discuss mine? Really
it’s a personnel issue as far as when I come back and when I’m
full go,” Dantonio said. “I’m going to listen to our doctors,
but I am going to ease back into this and do something daily
with our football team. We’ll start at X amount and build back
to where it was before.”  Offensive coordinator  Don Treadwell  filled in as coach last
week, when the Spartans beat Northern Colorado  45-7  and Dantonio
watched the game from home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
