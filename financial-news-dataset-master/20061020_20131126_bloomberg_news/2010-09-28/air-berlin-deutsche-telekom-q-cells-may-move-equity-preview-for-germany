German stocks closed little
changed, as concern that the sovereign-debt crisis is worsening
and a drop in U.S. consumer confidence outweighed gains in Metro
AG and Fresenius Medical Care AG.  Volkswagen AG declined 0.9 percent as IHS Automotive cut
its forecast for car and truck sales in the U.S. during the rest
of this year.  Q-Cells SE  jumped 2.2 percent, snapping the
shares’ longest losing streak in almost three months, while
Metro AG added 1.1 percent.  The benchmark  DAX Index  was little changed, losing less
than 0.1 percent to 6,276.09 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Frankfurt. The measure has rallied 5.9 percent this month,
bringing its quarterly gain to 5.2 percent, as investors
speculated that the economy will continue to grow even as
European nations slash spending to control their budget deficits
and China takes steps to cool its growth. The broader  HDAX Index 
was also little changed.  “The economic recovery is moderate and it’s hanging on the
market,” said  Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein , an equity strategist at
Deutsche Postbank AG in Bonn. “We won’t have a strong year-end
rally. The DAX might rise to 6,400, but 7,000 is too
optimistic.”  German stocks dropped earlier after Standard & Poor’s said
the price of bailing out nationalized lender Anglo Irish Bank
Corp. could exceed $47 billion, causing the cost of insuring
Ireland’s debt to surge to a record.  Credit-default swaps tied to Irish bonds jumped as much as
30.5 basis points to 521.5 after more than doubling in the past
two months. The swaps reached 496 basis points as of 1:40 p.m.
in London, according to data provider CMA.  U.S. Consumer Confidence  Separately, the U.S. Conference Board reported that
confidence among U.S. consumers fell in September to the lowest
level in seven months as Americans became more pessimistic about
the labor market.  The board’s confidence index declined to 48.5 from 53.2 in
August, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed today. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a reading of 52.1.  Volkswagen AG  dropped 0.9 percent to 90.29 euros. European
carmakers fell 1.3 percent, the biggest retreat among 19
industry groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  IHS Automotive reduced its forecast for U.S. car and truck
sales this year to 11.3 million from 11.5 million. Vehicle
deliveries in the U.S. will rise to 12.8 million next year as
jobs and consumer confidence return, said  Nigel Griffiths , chief
automotive economist with the Lexington, Massachusetts-based
firm.  Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank  Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest bank, retreated 2.2
percent to 40.25 euros, while Commerzbank AG, the second-largest
lender, slid 1.7 percent to 6.09 euros.  Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s biggest provider of
kidney dialysis, jumped 2.1 percent to 45.47 euros. ThyssenKrupp
AG, the country’s largest steelmaker, climbed 1.3 percent to
23.89 euros, while Metro, the nation’s biggest retailer, added
1.1 percent to 47.50 euros.  Stada Arzneimittel AG, Germany’s largest publicly traded
maker of generic drugs, tumbled 7.7 percent to 21.99 euros, the
shares’ biggest loss since March last year. The company said it
will book a 29.5 million-euro ($40.1 million) pretax charge in
the third quarter because some of its Serbian wholesaler
customers are unable to pay their bills.  Q-Cells  jumped 2.2 percent to 4.94 euros after the German
solar-panel maker said it will start a rights offering, issue a
convertible bond and offered to repurchase a 2007/2012
convertible bond to help secure its medium-term financing.  The shares were raised to “neutral” from “sell” at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said the company’s
“comprehensive balance sheet restructuring package” has
removed a “key risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
