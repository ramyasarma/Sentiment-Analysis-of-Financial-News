Xstrata Plc , the world’s biggest
thermal coal  exporter , said the majority of the workforce at its
Tahmoor coking coal mine in Australia accepted a new wage deal
and the mine is set to resume full production.  “The majority of our workforce have accepted the new wage
agreement,”  James Rickards , an Xstrata Coal spokesman, said by
phone. “The mine has seen continuous industrial action for the
past nine months and there has been very little production
during that time.”  Tahmoor, located in New South Wales, produced 1.5 million
metric tons of coking coal in 2008 before the industrial action
started.  “The strike action has cost Xstrata millions of dollars,”
said Rickards, declining to give an exact figure. Tahmoor has a
workforce of 220 people, with about 50 workers turning down the
four-year wage deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
