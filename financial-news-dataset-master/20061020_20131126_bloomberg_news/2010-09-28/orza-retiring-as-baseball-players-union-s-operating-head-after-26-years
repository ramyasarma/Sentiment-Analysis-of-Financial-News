Gene Orza , the chief operating
officer for the  Major League Baseball Players Association , will
retire after 26 years with the union.  Orza, 64, will officially step down on March 31, 2011, the
association said in a news release.  Orza joined the union in 1984 as associate general counsel
and helped negotiate agreements between the players and Major
League Baseball since 1985. Eight years ago, he was involved in
a drug-testing compromise that ended an almost 20-year impasse
on the random testing of players.  Orza’s retirement comes 15 months after  Donald Fehr  stepped
down as head of the union.  Michael Weiner  replaced Fehr as the
association’s executive director.  “Each day since Don Fehr’s resignation has only served to
reaffirm just how fortunate the players are to have a person
like Michael to succeed him,” Orza said in a statement.
“Seeing the enormously talented people he’s been able to bring
on board -- well, it’s simply time for the old to make way for
the new.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
