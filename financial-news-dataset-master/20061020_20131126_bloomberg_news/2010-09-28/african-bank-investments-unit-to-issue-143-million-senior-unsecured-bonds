African Bank Ltd., a unit of
 African Bank Investments Ltd. , said it will issue two four-year
bonds, worth 1 billion rand ($143 million), made up of senior
unsecured debt.  The debt, which will be listed tomorrow, represents the
19th and 20th issuance of bonds under African Bank’s 15 billion-
rand domestic medium-term note program, the Midrand, South
Africa-based lender said in a statement today. For listing there
is a 525 million rand, 9.5 percent fixed-rate senior unsecured
bond with a redemption date in 2014 and a 475 million rand
floating-rate senior unsecured bond also due in 2014.  South African companies are boosting bond issues and
repaying existing debt with sales of new securities to take
advantage of record-low borrowing costs. Abil, as it’s known,
which provides small loans and finances furniture sales, said
tomorrow’s debt issue is 63 percent oversubscribed.  Government bonds have been strengthening this year, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 having
risen 2.6 percent to 125.96 rand. The yield on the bond was
unchanged at 7.18 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
