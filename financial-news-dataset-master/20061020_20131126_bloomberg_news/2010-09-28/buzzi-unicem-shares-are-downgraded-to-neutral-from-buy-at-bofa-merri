Buzzi Unicem SpA , Italy’s second-
biggest cement maker, was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy”
at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, which trimmed its price
estimate to 8 euros from 14 euros.  The brokerage said in a note today that “the second
quarter saw a material recovery in volumes across all regions.
However, it was not sufficient to counter the negative trend in
pricing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
