The  New Jersey Turnpike Authority 
said it hopes to begin alerting motorists to traffic jams -- 10
minutes before they occur.  The agency, which manages the two main toll roads in the
most densely populated U.S. state, approved the awarding of a
$652,000 contract to  En Pointe Technologies Inc.   The El Segundo, California-based company has a computer
system that is designed to give drivers an early heads-up on
developing traffic jams, to allow them more time to detour away
from congestion, Brian Gorman, director of technology, told
members of the authority’s board at their regular meeting today.  The system was tested on the 148-mile (238-kilometer)  New
Jersey Turnpike  and the 173-mile  Garden State Parkway , which
stretches from Cape May to the New York state line. It predicted
traffic with at least 90 percent accuracy, Gorman said.
Motorists will be alerted to potential problems through
electronic signage on the highways.  “We do have the ability to prevent congestion
disruption,” Gorman said.  The traffic-prediction tool, which uses software from
 International Business Machines  Corp. of Armonk, New York, is
already in use on highways in Singapore and Stockholm, Gorman
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
