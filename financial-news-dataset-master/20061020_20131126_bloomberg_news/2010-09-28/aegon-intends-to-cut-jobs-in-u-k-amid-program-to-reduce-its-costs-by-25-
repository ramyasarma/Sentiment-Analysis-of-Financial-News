Aegon NV , the Dutch insurer that
acquired Scottish Equitable, will cut jobs in the U.K. as part
of a program to reduce costs by 25 percent.  The company will shut a division that administers company
pension plans and an employee benefits software unit, Aegon said
in a statement today. It will also eliminate jobs at its
remaining asset management and life insurance operations.
Spokeswoman  Lesley McPherson  declined to say how many posts will
go before the firm starts formal consultations with labor unions
in coming weeks.  Aegon’s U.K. unit employs about 4,000 people, more than
half of them in Edinburgh. The division accounted for about 30
percent of the insurer’s  revenue . The Hague-based company said
in June it plans to reduce costs at its U.K. life and pension
operations to boost their return on capital to as much as 10
percent by 2014 from 2.7 percent in 2009.  “The ambitious scale of the proposed cost savings will
cause uncertainty across the business,” said  Rob MacGregor , a
spokesman for the  Unite trade union . “It will be a mistake for
Aegon to make any attempt to try to achieve these huge cost
savings at the expense of their workforce.”  The third-party pension administration and employee
benefits software units employ 89 people, Aegon said. The
insurer has already withdrawn from the bulk annuities market in
the U.K. and this month said it would cut 106 sales jobs in the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
