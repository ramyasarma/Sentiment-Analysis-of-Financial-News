The euro may rise to $1.38 if it
stays above key support levels,  ING Groep NV  said, citing
technical indicators.  The 16-nation currency faces support at $1.3415 and
$1.3380, according to  Roelof-Jan Van den Akker , an Amsterdam-
based senior technical analyst at ING.  “Prices are testing the short-term support area in the
hourly chart between the horizontal support level at $1.3415 and
the underlying trend line at $1.3380,” Van den Akker wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “A break above the $1.3500 level
likely suggests a test of the $1.3750 to $1.3800 resistance
area.”  The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3466 as of 1:36 p.m. in
London, and has climbed 6 percent this year.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a chart
where analysts anticipate orders to sell a security and a
support level is an area there they anticipate buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
