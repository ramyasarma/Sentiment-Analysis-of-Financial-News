Uganda’s state pension fund
reported a return of 7 percent on members’ contributions for the
year through June, Chairman Vincent Ssekkono said.  The “National Social Security Fund has increased the
interest rate paid to members from 3 percent to 7 percent in
fiscal 2010,” he said in a  statement  published on the Kampala-
based fund’s website today. The fund “will pay a higher rate in
future as the fund’s financial performance continues to
improve.”  The fund reported pretax profit of 160 billion Ugandan
shillings ($71 million) for the year as fixed-income deposits
grew 24 percent to 135 billion shillings. Members’ funds
increased 12 percent to 1.6 trillion shillings from a year
earlier, while workers contributing to the pension rose to
450,000 from 350,000.  The East African nation’s annual inflation rate climbed to
4.4 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
