Everything Everywhere, a joint
venture between France Telecom SA and  Deutsche Telekom AG , said
it’s targeting sustained profit gains, wringing growth out of
one of Europe’s most competitive mobile-phone markets.  The 50-50 venture “will continuously grow” its level of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to achieve a 25 percent EBITDA margin by 2014, the unit said in
an e-mailed statement. Everything Everywhere said it’s seeking
“double-digit” growth in its cash flow in the period.  France Telecom  and Deutsche Telekom are betting that their
venture, the U.K.’s largest wireless operator, will keep growing
as the country’s mobile-phone market matures. The combination
cut the number of mobile operators in the U.K. to four from
five, bringing it in line with Italy, Spain, and Germany.  The unit saw stable revenue in the second quarter, not
including the impact of new U.K. rules on mobile termination
rates, which shaved 101 million pounds ($159 million) from the
1.56 billion-pound total, according to today’s statement.
Second-quarter profit was 309 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
