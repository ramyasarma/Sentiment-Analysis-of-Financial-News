Corporate borrowers in the U.S. are
squeezing investors as record-low interest rates and a lack of
high-yielding alternatives force bondholders to accept the
smallest premiums on new debt sales since March.  Yields on new bonds fell to within 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, of existing securities on average last month,
according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest
underwriter of the debt. The new-issue premium is approaching
the lowest level since the credit crisis began in mid-2007.  Microsoft Corp.,  DuPont Co.  and Anglo American Plc, taking
advantage of record-low borrowing costs, have led $332 billion
of U.S. debt sales in the busiest third-quarter on record.
Investors searching for yield have poured more than $100 billion
into bond funds this year as the Federal Reserve keeps its
target interest-rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  “We’re all unhappy,” said  Didi Weinblatt , vice president
of mutual fund portfolios at USAA Investment Management in San
Antonio, where she helps oversee about $45 billion. “But from
the underwriter’s point of view, they don’t have to give
concessions if the deal’s oversubscribed.”  Even with the declining concessions, new issues in August
and most of September are beating the broader bond market,
according to JPMorgan. Relative yields on notes decreased a
weighted average 7 basis points on the first trading day and a
further 13 basis points to Sept. 17, the New York-based bank
wrote in a report released that day.  Spreads, Returns  The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. investment-
grade corporate debt narrowed 5 basis points from the end of
July to 184 basis points on Sept. 17, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. The index was at the same level
yesterday, yielding 3.645 percent, the lowest in data going back
to October 1986.  Elsewhere in credit markets, spreads on company debt
worldwide were unchanged at 173 basis points, down from this
year’s high of 201 basis points on June 11, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.
Yields averaged 3.425 percent, the lowest since June 2003.  A benchmark indicator of corporate credit risk in the U.S.
fell for a second day. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, declined 1 basis point to a mid-price of 107.8
basis points as of 11:35 a.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd.  That’s the lowest level since a new series of the index
with new maturities started trading Sept. 20. The measure
typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates.  BP Bonds Rise  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  BP Plc’s $3.5 billion of bonds, its first debt sale since a
rig explosion caused the largest offshore U.S. spill in history,
rose on their first day of trading, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  The energy company’s $2 billion of five-year, 3.125 percent
notes rose 0.88 cent to 100.59 cents on the dollar, yielding 175
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, as of 11:42
a.m. in New York, Trace data show.  BP’s $1.5 billion of 10-year, 4.5 percent bonds increased
2.3 cents to 101.74 cents on the dollar, a spread of 181.8 basis
points.  ‘Lot of Money’  The London-based energy company sold the debt yesterday
through its BP Capital Markets Plc unit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Corporate bond sales total $788.7 billion worldwide this
quarter, up from $596.4 billion last quarter and below the
$940.1 billion issued in the first three months, Bloomberg data
show.  U.S. sales this month of $142.8 billion are the highest for
any September and the most since March 2009, when $143.9 billion
of notes were sold, Bloomberg data show.  “Investors have a lot of money to invest, but there’s also
a lot of supply,” Ford Treasurer  Neil Schloss  said yesterday in
an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “And so
they’re picking and choosing and they’re making sure the bonds
are appropriately priced.”  Premium Narrows  Company debt has returned 4.02 percent this quarter,
including reinvested interest, topping the 2.27 percent gain on
government bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Year-to-date returns total 9.21 percent, compared with
14.8 percent at this point in 2009.  The average new-issue premium in the U.S. has narrowed
since reaching a 2010 high of 40 basis points in June, according
to JPMorgan data, when concern European nations would struggle
to fund spiraling budget deficits made investors wary of
corporate and government borrowers.  Anglo American , the owner of stakes in the world’s largest
diamond and platinum producers, sold $1.25 billion of 3- and 10-
year bonds on Sept. 20. The 2.15 percent, 3-year notes paid a
spread of 145 basis points, 41 basis points less than its
existing debt, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  London-based Anglo American’s yield spread narrowed 10
basis points to 135 basis points a day after the offering and
now trades at 122, according to generic Bloomberg prices.  DuPont, Microsoft  DuPont , the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker based in
Wilmington, Delaware, sold $2 billion of notes on Sept. 20,
including 30-year debt that paid a spread 4 basis points less
than its existing securities.  Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker based in
Redmond, Washington, sold $4.75 billion of bonds on Sept. 22,
including $1 billion of 4.5 percent debentures due in 2040. The
debt rose 0.274 cent to 99.185 cents on the dollar in its first
day of trading, according to Trace.  The Fed has stoked demand by keeping its main target rate
at an all-time low since December 2008 to fuel the economic
recovery. The central bank will likely keep the target unchanged
through the second quarter of 2011, according to the median
estimate of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Investors are really looking for any kind of yield,”
said  Tim Brunne , a credit strategist in Munich at UniCredit SpA.
“It’s very difficult for investors that can’t simply wait for
big new issue premiums. They have to buy what’s offered.”  Investors plowed $107.4 billion into investment-grade
mutual funds this year through Sept. 22, and $8.3 billion into
high-yield mutual funds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts
wrote in a Sept. 23 report citing Lipper FMI data.  “As long as people throw money into bond funds, people
will buy” the new securities, USAA’s Weinblatt said. “I just
have this gnawing feeling that people are going to be sorry.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
