A former TFS Derivatives Ltd.
broker was banned from working in the U.K. finance industry for
paying kickbacks to a former trader at hedge fund AKO Capital
LLP who pleaded guilty in June to insider-trading charges.  In addition to the ban,  Fabio Massimo De Biase , the broker,
was also fined 252,239 pounds ($400,750) by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority for paying 131,000 pounds to  Anjam Ahmad  at
AKO in exchange for brokerage business between January 2008 and
September 2009, the regulator said today in a  statement . The men
overcharged the hedge fund by $739,000 on commissions to
increase the amount of money they split, the FSA said.  “De Biase exploited the trust of his employer and his
client,” FSA head of enforcement  Margaret Cole  said. “This
substantial fine and the ban from working in the financial
services industry are significant penalties and should serve as
a reminder that such behavior is woefully short of that expected
of approved persons and will not be tolerated.”  The FSA’s enforcement unit has increased prosecutions in
the past two years and adopted a policy of “credible
deterrence” to prevent market abuse. It has more than doubled
the amount of fines levied this year versus last year. Ahmad
became the first person to plead guilty to insider-trading
charges in the U.K. when he cooperated with the regulator.  Mark Duffell, a spokesman for De Biase’s lawyers at  Irwin
Mitchell , wasn’t immediately available to comment. De Biase
received a reduction to his fine for agreeing to settle the
case.  Ahmad’s Admission  Ahmad was fined 287,000 pounds in June, 131,000 pounds of
which was for pushing trades to De Biase. In the insider dealing
case, Ahmad admitted to passing information on AKO’s block
trades to a co-conspirator who placed spread bets before the
hedge fund’s trades. AKO Capital, where Ahmad worked until
September 2009, hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing.  Ahmad had said he committed insider trading relating to as
many as 22 different companies in 2009. For his cooperation, he
received a suspended sentence so he will serve no jail time, and
must complete 300 hours of community service.  De Biase, 39, who lives in the Fulham neighborhood of
London, was ordered to pay back 198,000 pounds he profited from
the scheme, and a 54,239-pound fine, reduced from 500,000 pounds
because of “serious financial hardship” and cooperation,
according to the regulator.  To contact the reporter for this story:
