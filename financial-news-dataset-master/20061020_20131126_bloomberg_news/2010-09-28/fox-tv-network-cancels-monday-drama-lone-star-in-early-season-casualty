Fox television’s Monday night drama
“Lone Star” is the first casualty of the new TV season as low
ratings led the network to cancel the show after two episodes.  The third season of “Lie to Me” will replace “Lone
Star” Mondays at 9 p.m., Fox, a unit of New York-based  News
Corp. , said today in an e-mailed statement.  Last night’s “Lone Star” drew 23 percent fewer viewers in
the 18-to-49-year-old target audience than a week ago, Fox said,
citing data from Nielsen Co. “Dancing with the Stars” on  Walt
Disney Co. ’s ABC drew the most viewers in the time period.  “Lone Star,” produced by Twentieth Century Fox
Television, was about a oil-industry con man who leads two lives
in Texas and wants to break away from his father, who taught him
his deceptive trade.  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , gained 2 cents to $13.61 in Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading . The Class A shares are little changed this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
