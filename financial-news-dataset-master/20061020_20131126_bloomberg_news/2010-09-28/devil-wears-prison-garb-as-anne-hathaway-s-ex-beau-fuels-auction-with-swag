Raffaello Follieri  claimed he had
ties to the Vatican. He dated the star of “The Devil Wears
Prada.” Now the baubles he accumulated as a servant of Mammon
have been sold at auction.  The sale raised $95,047 for the victims of the Italian
conman’s crimes. Prosecutors said Follieri stole $4 million from
investors, including  Ron Burkle ’s private-equity firm Yucaipa
Cos.  Rolex watches and diamond-and-sapphire earrings were among
20 lots with opening bids ranging from $30 to $6,375, many below
market prices. The auction was organized by the U.S. Marshals
Service, and bids were placed on the website of  Gaston & Sheehan
Auctioneers Inc.  until 10:15 a.m. today.  Follieri,  Anne Hathaway ’s ex-boyfriend, was convicted of
wire and real-estate fraud and money laundering, and sentenced
in 2008 to 4 1/2 years in prison. He spent his money on a
$37,000-a-month apartment overlooking Manhattan’s Central Park,
private jets and personal vacations with Hathaway.  He told investors he had special connections to the Vatican
and could obtain church properties in the U.S. at a significant
discount.  Despite the celebrity pedigree, the auction bidding wasn’t
spectacular. All opening bids amounted to less than $30,000. By
yesterday afternoon New York time, they had increased to
$49,223.  In online auctions, “the bids go up toward the end of the
auction,” said  Roland Ubaldo , spokesman for the U.S. Marshals
Service.  The top lot, an 18-karat yellow-gold Daytona Cosmograph by
Rolex reached $14,826 yesterday, compared with a retail price of
$29,500. A 1995 Rolex Submariner that cost $6,000 until it was
discontinued in 2009 went for $5,000. An Audemars Piguet Royal
Oak watch that retails for $17,900 sold for $7,201.  Four Years Dating  Hathaway and Follieri broke up before his arrest in June
2008, after dating for four years, People.com reported at the
time.  The conman’s ex-girlfriend turned over the trinkets he had
given her to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to
special agent  James M. Margolin  of FBI New York. These pieces
were part of the online auction, Margolin said.  Hathaway’s cascading blue sapphire-and-diamond earrings
opened at $1,370 and sold for $10,525. A multi-tier diamond
bracelet fetched $10,775. A set of two rings, including a blue-
green flash-fire opal, reached $3,055.  Follieri is serving his sentence in a low-security prison
for male inmates in Loretto, Pennsylvania, according to the
website of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  To contact the reporter of this story:
