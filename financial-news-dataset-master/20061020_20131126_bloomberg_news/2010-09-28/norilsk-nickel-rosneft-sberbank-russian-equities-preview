month high in New York as traders judged prices were too high
given lackluster economic growth after reports last week

unemployment may continue to stifle recovery. Norilsk, Russia’s
biggest miner, fell 0.4 percent to 5,031.24 rubles.  OAO Rosneft  (ROSN RX): Crude oil futures fell from the
highest level in almost two weeks, dropping 1.1 percent to
$75.63 a barrel in New York, as U.S. stocks declined and the
dollar gained on the euro, reducing the appeal of commodities as
an alternative investment. Shares of Russia’s biggest oil
producer fell 0.6 percent to 200.73 rubles.  OAO Sberbank  (SBER03 RX): The Russian central bank will
leave its benchmark refinancing rate unchanged at a record low
