U.S. stocks erased losses as an
advance in consumer and health-care companies helped the market
recover from an early drop triggered by a bigger-than-forecast
slump in consumer confidence.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,142.37 at 11:25 a.m. in New York after slumping as much as
0.9 percent in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 16.35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,828.39.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
