Game Group Plc , Europe’s biggest
electronics game retailer, said it posted a first-half loss as
Nintendo Wii sales declined.  Net loss was 15.4 million pounds ($24.3 million), or 4.44
pence per share in the six months ended July 31, compared with a
profit of 7.7 million pounds, or 2.23 pence per share in the
same period a year earlier, the Basingstoke, England-based
company said in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News
Service. Sales fell 9.6 percent to 624.6 million pounds.  Game hired  Ian Shepherd , former Vodafone Group Plc U.K.
consumer director, as chief executive officer in June to turn
around falling sales. Nintendo Wii revenue in the U.K. dropped
40 percent during the period after “explosive growth” in 2008
and 2009, the company said.  “We have returned to our traditional seasonal trading
profile with losses reported in the first half and all profits
being made in the second half,” Chairman  Peter Lewis  said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
