Romania will probably sell 15
percent of  Transelectrica SA , the state-controlled power grid
manager, by May 2011, to help cover a budget deficit and finance
investment, Chief Executive Officer  Adrian Baicusi  said today.  The government, which owns 73.7 percent of the utility,
plans a secondary offering on the Bucharest exchange to increase
Transelectrica’s traded equity to 27.8 percent, Baicusi told
Bloomberg News in an interview.  “We’re expecting the sale via the secondary offering to
happen by May if the process stays on track,” Baicusi said.  Romania plans to sell minority slices of its utilities and
of  OMV Petrom SA , the country’s biggest oil company, to meet
international bailout conditions and to finance infrastructure
investment. The country is relying on a 20 billion-euro ($27
billion) bailout led by the International Monetary Fund after
recession and austerity measures reduced budget revenue.  Transelectrica’s shares were unchanged at 18.8 lei as of
2:07 p.m. local time in Bucharest, valuing the company at 1.38
billion lei ($435 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
