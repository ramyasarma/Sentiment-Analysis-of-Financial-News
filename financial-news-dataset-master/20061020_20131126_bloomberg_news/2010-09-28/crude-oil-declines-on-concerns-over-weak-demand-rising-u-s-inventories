Crude oil futures fell as
MasterCard Inc. said U.S. gasoline demand declined for the fifth
time in six weeks and on speculation that gasoline inventories
rose from a six-month high.  Oil dropped after MasterCard, the second-biggest payments
network company, reported that demand slipped 0.2 percent to
8.98 million barrels of fuel a day in the week ended Sept. 24.
An Energy Department report tomorrow may show  gasoline
stockpiles  climbed 350,000 barrels last week, according to the
median of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “People are looking ahead to the stats tomorrow, and we
should expect another build in gasoline,” said  Carl Larry ,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “There is
a lot of oil in inventory right now and prices are going to have
a hard time to stay up.”  Crude for November delivery declined 34 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $76.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price was $76.78 at 2 p.m., when the MasterCard
report was released.  Gasoline demand was down year-over-year for the third
consecutive week, dropping 2.1 percent, according to MasterCard.
Averaged over four weeks, demand was down 0.7 percent from a
year earlier, the first decline in that average in 11 weeks.  “The market is waiting for concrete evidence of demand
coming back,” said  Chris Barber , a senior analyst at Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.  Brent crude oil for November delivery advanced 14 cents, or
0.2 percent, to settle at $78.71 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Gasoline Inventories  Gasoline inventories rose to 226.1 million barrels in the
week ended Sept. 17, the highest level since March 12, the
Energy Department reported last week. Supplies were 15 percent
above the five-year average for the period.  Gasoline output  has outpaced  demand  during the past three
weeks, according to the Energy Department. Refineries produced
9.02 million barrels a day last week, exceeding demand of 8.85
million.  “Demand is relatively weak and we have more than
sufficient supply,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an analysis and research firm for energy companies
based in London, Arkansas. “Inventories are in good shape, so
there is no fundamental reason for oil prices to keep rising.”  Total petroleum supplies, including crude oil and fuel,
climbed to 1.14 billion barrels in the same week, the highest
since at least 1990, according to the department. Total
consumption of petroleum products fell 1.8 percent that week.  Crude Stockpiles  Crude stockpiles  probably declined  700,000 barrels last
week from the previous week’s 358.3 million, and inventories of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, may rise 325,000 barrels, the Bloomberg survey showed.  Refineries probably operated at 87.2 percent of capacity,
down 0.6 percentage point from the previous week, according to
the survey.  Crude oil inventories declined 2.42 million barrels to
361.7 million last week, the American Petroleum Institute said
today. Gasoline supplies gained 3.02 million barrels to 230.8
million, the report showed. API collects stockpile information
on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk
terminals and pipelines.  Crude advanced 0.8 percent in earlier trading as U.S.
stocks rose and a weaker dollar boosted oil’s appeal as an
alternative investment.  Dollar Decline  The dollar fell against the euro to the lowest level in
five months after the Conference Board, a private research group
in New York, said its confidence index fell to 48.5 in September
from 53.2 the prior month. Analysts expected a drop to 52.1.  The dollar declined 0.9 percent to $1.3579 per euro. It
touched $1.3595, the weakest level since April 15.  The dollar
index , a gauge of the currency versus six major trading
partners, fell 0.6 percent to 78.995.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.4 percent to
1,147.70 at 4:22 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained
0.4 percent to 10,858.14.  “Investors are using the stock market as a proxy of future
economic performance,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 591,300 contracts as of 3:42
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 577,362
contracts yesterday, 10 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.33 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
