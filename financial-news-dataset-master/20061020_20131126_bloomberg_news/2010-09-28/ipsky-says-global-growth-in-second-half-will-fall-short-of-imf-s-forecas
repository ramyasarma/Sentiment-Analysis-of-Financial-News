John Lipsky, the No. 2 official at
the International Monetary Fund, said global economic growth in
the second half of this year will fall short of the fund’s
forecast.  “Growth has slowed in this year’s second half,”  he said
in the text of a speech posted on the IMF’s website today, and
added that “this sluggishness will persist into early 2011.”
The Washington-based fund had forecast growth at a 3.75 percent
annual rate for the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
