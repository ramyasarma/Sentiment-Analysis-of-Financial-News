A proposed four-team swap that
would have brought  Carmelo Anthony  to New Jersey was called off
after the Nets said trade rumors had become too much of a
distraction to their players, the  New York Daily News said.   The Nets nixed the trade hours after issuing a one-day
deadline to the Denver Nuggets, Anthony’s current team, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified Nets official.  Nets rookie forward Derrick Favors and point guard  Devin Harris  have had to answer repeated questions about their future
since the trade rumors started last week, the Daily News said.
The deal, which also involved the Utah Jazz and Charlotte
Bobcats, may have also been derailed by the Nuggets’ insistence
that the Nets take oft-injured  Kenyon Martin  and give up  Troy Murphy , the Daily News said on its website.  Anthony has averaged 24.7 points and 6.2 rebounds per game
over his seven seasons in the National Basketball Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
