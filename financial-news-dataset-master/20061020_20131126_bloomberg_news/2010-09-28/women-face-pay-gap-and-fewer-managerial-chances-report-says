Women continued to face lower wages
and fewer managerial opportunities than men during the past
decade, a government study found.  Women managers earned 81 cents for every $1 earned by male
managers in 2007, up 2 cents from 79 cents in 2000, according to
the Government Accountability Office report released today.  “Women are more productive and better educated than
they’ve ever been, but their pay hasn’t caught up,” said
Representative  Carolyn Maloney , a New York Democrat, at a
hearing today of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee.  The GAO study also found that women in 2007 made up 40
percent of managers and 49 percent of non-managers in 13
industry sectors that account for most of the U.S. workforce. In
2000, the breakdown for women was 39 percent managers and 49
percent non-managers.  In all but three of the 13 industries, “women were less
than proportionately represented in management positions than
non-management positions in 2007,” the study said.  The report focused on the period prior to the worst U.S.
recession since the Great Depression. The GAO wanted “avoid
concerns about the role of the recession that began” in
December 2007, the report said.  A bill addressing the discrepancy in gender pay is stalled
in the Senate. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which would lift the
cap on damages in pay-discrimination suits and restrict how
employers can fight such complaints, was passed in the House in
July 2008 and again in January 2009.  The bill is S.3772.  To contact the reporter on this story:
