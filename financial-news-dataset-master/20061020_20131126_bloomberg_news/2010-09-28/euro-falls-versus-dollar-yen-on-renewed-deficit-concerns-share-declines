The euro weakened against the
dollar and the yen for a second-straight day as stocks dropped
and concern mounted that governments in the region will struggle
to reduce their budget deficits.  The 16-nation currency retreated from near a five-month
high against the dollar. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.9
percent. Sovereign-rating downgrades are likely to persist
because of deficits and demographic pressure on public finances,
Standard & Poor’s said yesterday. The Swiss franc appreciated
against the euro after a  consumer gauge  climbed to the highest
level in more than two years in August.  “The peripheral story is gaining momentum and is likely to
take center stage again,” said  Lee Hardman , a strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “There’s very
limited upside for the euro from here.”  The euro weakened to $1.3408 as of 9:10 a.m. in London,
from $1.3455 in New York yesterday, when it traded at $1.3507,
the highest level since April 20. The euro bought 112.92 yen,
from 113.41 yen. The U.S. currency was at 84.22 yen, from 84.29
yen. The dollar has depreciated 8.6 percent versus the euro this
quarter, the worst performance among 16 major counterparts and
paring this year’s advance to 7.1 percent.  The franc strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.3210 against the
European common currency.  UBS AG ’s  index of Swiss consumption , which aims to predict
developments about three months ahead, climbed to 1.95 from a
revised 1.88 in July, the Zurich-based bank said today in an e-
mailed statement. That’s the highest since June 2008.  The cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank Corp. may exceed S&P’s
previous 35 billion-euro ($47 billion) estimate,  Trevor Cullinan , a credit analyst at the ratings company, said in an
interview broadcast by Dublin’s RTE Radio today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
