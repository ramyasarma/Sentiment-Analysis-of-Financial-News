France’s  CAC 40 Index  was little
changed, rising 0.33 point to 3,766.49 at 1:33 p.m. in Paris.
 The SBF 120 Index  gained 1.33 points to 2,799.84.  The following shares rose or fell in the French capital.
Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Alcatel-Lucent SA  (ALU FP), France’s largest
telecommunications equipment maker, climbed 3.7 percent to 2.58
euros, the highest level in five months. The shares are
benefiting as short sellers close their trades along with
positive cashflow prospects and yesterday’s comments from Chief
Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen on a possible dividend in 2012,
said  Thomas Laschetti , a trader at Tullett Prebon Ltd. in
London.  Le Belier SA  (BELI FP) surged the most in two months,
rising 9.2 percent to 6.90 euros after the maker of aluminum
aerospace and automotive parts said it sees “sustained” sales
growth this year. The company posted first-half net income of
5.1 million euros ($6.9 million), compared with a 2 million-euro
loss a year earlier.  Michelin & Cie.  (ML FP) dropped 10 percent to 58.70 euros,
the biggest loss since March 2009, after the world’s second-
largest tiremaker announced plans to raise 1.2 billion euro by
selling new shares to fund its expansion in emerging markets.
Investors may buy 2 new shares at 45 euros each for every 11
held, Michelin said.  PSA Peugeot Citroen  (UG FP) slid 2.6 percent to 24.96
euros, while  Renault SA  (RNO FP) dropped 0.6 percent to 37.28
euros as automobile shares were the worst performers in Europe
after Michelin’s announcement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
