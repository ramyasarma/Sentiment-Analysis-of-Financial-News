Newmont Mining Corp. , the largest
U.S. gold producer, has expressed interest in developing mines
in Afghanistan, the country’s minister of mines said.  Newmont attended a conference held in London in June to
promote the development of the country’s mineral resources and
has been in contact with the Afghan government since then,
Minister of Mines  Wahidullah Shahrani  said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York today.  Afghanistan expects to receive as much as $1.2 billion
annually in revenue in five to seven years from iron ore,
copper, gold, oil and gas deposits, rising to $3 billion to $3.5
billion after 10 to 15 years, Shahrani said. The government has
talked to  ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest steelmaker, and
plans to hold discussions with London-based mining company  Rio
Tinto Group , he said in June.  Newmont, which is based in Greenwood Village, Colorado,
operates mines in North and South America, Africa and Australia.  “They also expressed their interest in coming and
investing in the gold mines of Afghanistan,” Shahrani said.
“Since then, there has been some communication on getting some
information from the government of Afghanistan.”  Omar Jabara , a spokesman for Newmont, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  Afghanistan has put up an iron-ore deposit for tender
and the deadline for submission of expressions of interest is
Jan. 13, he said. Companies will submit final bids in June,
Shahrani said. Afghanistan also expects to hold a tender for an
oil deposit in March and a copper deposit next summer, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
