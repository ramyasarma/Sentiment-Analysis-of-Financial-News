(Corrects share of investment forecast in last paragraph.)  European Union targets for clean-
energy generation will drive investments in wind turbines over
the next decade, boosting profit for Iberdrola Renovables SA and
EDP Renovaveis SA, Berenberg Bank said.  Renewable energy developers are better placed than power
companies to profit from an expected 324 billion euros ($434
billion) of investments in wind generation through 2020, analyst
Benita Barretto said. She initiated coverage of Iberdrola
Renovables and EDP Renovaveis with “buy” ratings on each and
target prices of 3 euros and 5.50 euros, respectively.  The EU aims to produce 20 percent of its energy from
renewable sources by 2020 as part of a plan to reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions and create new jobs in the clean-power
industry. That target will see the continent’s wind-generating
capacity reach 206 gigawatts from 68 gigawatts last year,
Barretto forecast in a research report.  Wind power specialists Renovables and Renovaveis, along
with Acciona SA, EDF Energies Nouvelles SA and Enel Green Power
SpA, will develop about 21 percent of that capacity, Barretto
forecast. Other power companies will provide 9 percent and small
developers will make up the rest of the investment, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
