Industrial Securities Co. raised
2.63 billion yuan ($393 million) in a Shanghai initial public
offering, the maximum amount sought.  The Fujian-based brokerage sold 263 million shares at 10
yuan apiece, the top end of its price range of 9 yuan to 10 yuan,
according to its  filing  to Shanghai Stock Exchange today.  Industrial will use the proceeds to add brokerage business
outlets and develop new business including margin trading and
securities lending, it said in a prospectus published on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange on Sep 14. UBS Securities Co. is
arranging the sales.  “The total amount Industrial planned to raise was
relatively small. And it was well marketed to attract enough
institutional interest,” said  Hong Jinping , an analyst at China
Merchants Securities Co.  Earnings at Chinese securities companies have been hurt by
a 20 percent decline in the Shanghai Composite Stock Index this
year. Listed securities companies dropped over 30 percent on
average during the same period.  Industrial also plans to use proceeds to boost underwriting
capacity and direct investment, it said.  -- Eva Woo . With assistance from  Winnie Zhu  in Shanghai Editors:
