Inflation in Belgium accelerated to
the fastest in almost two years in September, led by higher
costs for natural gas.  The inflation rate in Belgium, the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.3 percent in August,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Brussels said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s the highest rate since November 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
