Kenya has raised 45 percent of the
105 billion shillings targeted in Treasury bills and bonds in
the year through June 2011, the director of the Finance
Ministry’s debt management department said.  The East African nation is “on track” to raise the full
amount targeted in its budget plan, John Murugu said in an
interview today in the capital, Nairobi.  Low cut-off rates for Treasury bills are “good for the
government” because it can access affordable borrowing, he
said. “There’s a lot of liquidity in the market,” Murugu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
