The Tampa Bay Rays will give away
20,000 tickets to tomorrow night’s game against the Baltimore
Orioles after poor attendance last night drew criticism from the
team’s players, according to the St. Petersburg Times.  The tickets will be available tomorrow at Tropicana Field
beginning at 4:45 p.m. local time, the  newspaper said  on its
website. An e-mail seeking comment from Chris Costello, a
spokesman for the Rays, wasn’t immediately returned.  The Rays last night drew 12,446 fans to their game against
the Orioles while needing only a win to clinch a playoff berth.
Tropicana Field holds 36,973 for baseball during the regular
season.  After the game, Rays third baseman  Evan Longoria  told
reporters the poor attendance was “disheartening.” Pitcher
 David Price  posted a message on his Twitter account that said:
“Had a chance to clinch a postseason spot tonight with about
10,000 fans in the stands .... embarrassing.”  Tampa Bay, which went to the World Series in 2008, is 93-63
entering tonight’s game against Baltimore, a half-game ahead of
the New York Yankees (93-64) in the American League East.  The Rays have averaged 22,913 fans in 79 home games this
season. They rank 22nd of the 30 Major League Baseball teams in
attendance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
