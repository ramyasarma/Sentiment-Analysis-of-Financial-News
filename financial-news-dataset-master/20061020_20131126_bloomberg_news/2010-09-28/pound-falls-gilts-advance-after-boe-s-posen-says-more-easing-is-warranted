The pound weakened after Bank of
England policy maker Adam Posen said the central bank should
resume its asset-purchase program to boost the economy.  Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5799 as of 2:04 p.m. in
London, and depreciated 0.4 percent to 85.36 pence per euro.  “There remains a significant gap between what the economy
could be producing at full employment and it currently
produces,” Posen said in a speech today in Hull, England.
“Monetary policy should continue to be aggressive about
promoting recovery, and, subject to further debate, I think
further easing should be undertaken.”  Gilts rose, sending the yield on the 10-year bond down 2
basis points to 2.95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
