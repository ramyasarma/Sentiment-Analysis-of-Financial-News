PetroEcuador, the state-owned oil
company, will complete repairs at its  Esmeraldas refinery  by
Oct. 8, about a week longer than previously forecast, a refinery
official said.  Repairs to the refinery’s catalytic cracker unit, which
produces about 10,000 barrels of high-octane gasoline per day,
were previously scheduled to be finished by Sept. 30, the
official who declined to be identified because of company policy
said today in a telephone interview. The repairs are taking
longer than expected because damage in the unit was worse than
originally thought, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
