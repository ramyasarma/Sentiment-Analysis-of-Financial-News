Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s Mini
Cooper cars are under investigation by the U.S. auto-safety
regulator for possible defects that can cause the power steering
to fail, raising the risk of a crash.  Mini Coopers from model years 2004 and 2005 have been the
subject of 54 complaints about unexpected power-steering loss,
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today on
its website. An estimated 80,000 vehicles are subject to the
U.S. investigation.  The company will provide information sought by the agency,
said  Tom Kowaleski , a U.S.-based spokesman for BMW of Munich.  NHTSA in July opened an investigation into the BMW Z4’s
power steering following 107 complaints and one crash involving
vehicles from the 2003 to 2005 model years.  Mini Cooper drivers in their complaints to the regulator
reported intermittent power-steering failure that technicians
were unable to replicate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
