The  U.S. Supreme Court  agreed to
hear an appeal from  Anna Nicole Smith ’s estate of a ruling that
gave the former Playboy model nothing from the fortune left by
her billionaire late husband, J.  Howard Marshall II .  More than four years after they ruled in Smith’s favor in a
legal fight with her stepson, E.  Pierce Marshall , the justices
today agreed to intervene in the case a second time.  Smith’s estate is seeking to revive claims stemming from a
half-billion-dollar trust her husband, a Texas oil tycoon, set
up for her before his 1995 death. She accused Pierce Marshall,
who died in 2006, of illegally interfering with the trust.  Smith at one point won an $89 million award on that claim,
which she filed with the court handling her bankruptcy case. A
federal appeals court ruled in March that Smith’s estate
couldn’t recover that money because a Texas court handling
Howard Marshall’s will had already ruled that he didn’t intend
to leave any of his $1.6 billion to her.  The issue for the Supreme Court is whether the appeals
court improperly limited the power of federal bankruptcy judges.  Smith was 26 when she married the 89-year-old Howard
Marshall in 1994. She died in 2007 at age 39 of an accidental
overdose of prescription drugs, leaving behind a daughter who is
now 4 years old. Smith’s onetime lawyer and boyfriend,  Howard K. Stern , is serving as executor of her estate.  The case is Stern v. Marshall, 10-179.  To contact the reporter on this story:
