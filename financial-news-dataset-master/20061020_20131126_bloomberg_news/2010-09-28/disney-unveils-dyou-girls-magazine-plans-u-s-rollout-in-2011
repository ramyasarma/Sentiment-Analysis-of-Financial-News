Walt Disney Co.,  the world’s
largest media company, introduced a new publication,  DYOU , as it
taps the magazine market for pre-teen girls worldwide.  The monthly is scheduled to go on sale in Italy tomorrow at
1.90 euros ($2.58) and to roll out in 30 countries including the
U.S. in 2011, Carlotta Saltini, chief marketing officer of Walt
Disney Co. Italia, said at a presentation in Milan today. DYOU,
whose D stands for Disney, features pop singer  Avril Lavigne  on
its first cover, as it expands beyond Disney’s stable of
celebrities such as Miley Cyrus.  “DYOU will have an international reach, but it comes from
Disney’s creative forge in Italy,” Saltini said. “It’s our
first international magazine aimed at girls aged 10 to 13. It’s
an ambitious project.”  Disney Publishing Worldwide is the largest  publisher  of
children’s books and magazines globally, reaching more than 100
million readers a month in 75 countries, according to the
company’s website. “Hannah Montana” and “High School
Musical” are among its magazines for teens.  DYOU was created in Milan, one of the company’s centers for
magazine development, Jeanne M. Mosure, Disney Publishing senior
vice president, said in an interview after the presentation.  “Italy is an important market for us and was key to the
initial launch of DYOU,” Mosure said. “Internationally, we
look forward strategically to our 30-country rollout --
including the U.S. -- in 2011.”  Disney, based in Burbank, California, slipped 10 cents to
$33.19 at 11:41 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The  shares  advanced 3.2 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
