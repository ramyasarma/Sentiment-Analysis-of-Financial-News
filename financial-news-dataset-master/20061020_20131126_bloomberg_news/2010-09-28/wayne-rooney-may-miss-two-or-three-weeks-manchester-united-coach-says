Manchester United forward Wayne
Rooney may miss two or three weeks with an ankle injury, manager
Alex Ferguson said today.  Rooney picked up an “ankle knock” during a match at
Bolton last weekend, according to a statement on United’s
website. Midfielder Paul Scholes will miss 10 days with a calf
injury.  Rio Ferdinand may play against Valencia in the Champions
League tomorrow, Ferguson said. The defender has only played
twice this season, and United have struggled defensively, giving
up 10 goals in seven games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
