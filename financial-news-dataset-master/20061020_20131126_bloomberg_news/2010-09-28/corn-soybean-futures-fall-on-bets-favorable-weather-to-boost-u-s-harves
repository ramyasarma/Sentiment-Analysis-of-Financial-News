Corn prices fell for the second
straight day and soybeans dropped on bets that favorable weather
will speed up the harvests in the U.S., the world’s biggest
producer and exporter of the crops.  Dry weather in the next 15 days will firm muddy soils for
heavy farm machinery after rains slowed fieldwork, said  Don Keeney , a senior agricultural meteorologist at MDA Information
Systems Inc. About 27 percent of the corn crop and 17 percent of
soybeans were harvested of Sept. 26, government data showed.  “Weather is bearish for the market today,” said  Chad Henderson , an analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin. “I’m still hearing very good soybean
yields from farmers, and corn yields are showing some
improvement.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 5 cents, or 1
percent, to $5.0775 a bushel at 10:36 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price fell 1.7 percent, the biggest
decline this month, after reaching $5.2875, the highest level
for a most-active contract since September 2008.  Before today, corn rose 37 percent since the end of June on
speculation that hot, dry weather in August damaged crops.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $11.26 a bushel, halting a four-session rally.
Yesterday, the price reached $11.44, the highest level since
June 5, 2009.  Corn rose to a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008, and
soybeans reached an all-time high of $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Agricultural-commodity prices will extend a rally next year
as corn supplies shrink and adverse weather threatens soybeans
in Latin America, Deutsche Bank AG said today in a report.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
