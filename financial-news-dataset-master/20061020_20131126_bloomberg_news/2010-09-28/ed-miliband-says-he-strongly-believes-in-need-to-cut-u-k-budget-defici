The leader of the U.K.’s opposition
Labour Party Ed Miliband said, “I believe
strongly we need to reduce the deficit.”  “There will be cuts and there would have been if we had
been in government,” Miliband told his party’s annual
conference in Manchester, northwest England today. “Some of
them will be painful and would have been if we were in
government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
