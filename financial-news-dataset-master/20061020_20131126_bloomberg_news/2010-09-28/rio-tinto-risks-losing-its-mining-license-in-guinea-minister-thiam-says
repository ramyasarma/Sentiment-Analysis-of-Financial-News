Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-
largest mining company, may lose its Guinean mining license
should it fail to hand over documentation for its Simandou iron
ore project, Mines and Geology Minister  Mahmoud Thiam  said.  The West African country sent a letter to London-based Rio
asking for documentation on Sept. 9 and the company hasn’t
responded, Thiam said in an e-mailed statement.  “The company must respect Guinea’s mining code and supply
these documents quarterly and annually but unfortunately, in 13
years, Rio never settled this obligation,” he said.  Rio Tinto has received the letter and continues “to engage
with the Guinean government on a range of matters and have
provided them with extensive documentation relating to the
project,” Rio said in an e-mailed response to questions. “We
are in the process of replying to their latest request.”  Rio, which sold a $1.35 billion stake in the project to
 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  in July, said Aug. 2 that it plans
to speed up development of Simandou after approving an extra
$170 million spending for infrastructure.  The company has previously described Simandou as the
world’s top undeveloped iron ore deposit. Guinea, the world’s
biggest bauxite producer, has been involved in a dispute with
Rio over the rights to Simandou since 2008, when the government
began reviewing mining contracts. The project may be worth $9.5
billion, UBS AG estimated in July.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
