Heavy rains in the eastern German
state of Saxony prompted officials to warn of potential floods
along rivers including the Elbe and the Spree, which flows
through Berlin.  Eight locations in Saxony, which borders the Czech Republic
and Poland, registered the highest level of alarm for flooding,
according to the state’s  environment ministry  website. Waters
continue to rise in cities and towns including Dresden and
Goerlitz.  Three people drowned in a basement in the town of
Neukirchen less than two months ago following heavy flooding in
Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland. As much as 90 liters (24
gallons) of rain per square meter (10.7 square feet) is expected
to fall in some areas over the next 48 hours, the German weather
service said on its website.  “Central Europe is currently under the influence of an
extensive low-pressure system,” said Thomas Ruppert, a
meteorologist at the  German weather service . “Cold air is
drawing up warm air that is cooling and condensing and leading
to prolific precipitation.”  Sandbags are being used to shore up dikes and in some
regions travel is being restricted, Der Spiegel reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
