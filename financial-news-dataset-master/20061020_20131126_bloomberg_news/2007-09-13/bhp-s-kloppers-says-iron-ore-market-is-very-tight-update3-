             BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world's
biggest mining company, said there's strong demand for iron ore
as mining companies and steelmakers prepare for annual price
negotiations later this year.  
 ``The market is very tight,''  Marius Kloppers , who will
become chief executive officer of Melbourne-based BHP on Oct. 1,
said in an interview in Santiago. It's ``very buoyant at the
moment,'' he said.  
 Benchmark prices may rise 30 percent next year because of a
shortage of supply, Merrill Lynch & Co. said last week. Cia.
Vale do Rio Doce, Rio Tinto Group and BHP, the three largest
exporters, can't expand production fast enough to meet demand
from steelmakers in  China , the biggest user of the alloy.  
 ``There's not a lot of spare ore out there,'' said Peter Arden, a commodity analyst at Ord Minnett Ltd. in  Melbourne .
``It's going to be a case of paying up for the steelmakers.''  
 BHP rose 15 cents, or 0.4 percent, to A$38.65 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney. It has gained 53 percent this year,
compared with a 9.9 percent advance in the Australian benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  
 Mining companies and steelmakers including ArcelorMittal
and Baosteel Group Corp. usually begin talks on annual contract
prices from October. Baosteel, China's largest steelmaker,
settled prices first in the last round of talks, agreeing to a
9.5 percent increase for 2007. It was the fifth straight
increase.  
 Chinese Demand  
 The Chinese ``will be very active,'' in talks this year,
and there's good demand from China and ``maybe  India ,'' Kloppers
said.  
 China, which makes a third of the world's steel, may boost
output by 15 percent to 490 million tons this year, the National
Development and Reform Commission, the country's top planning
agency, said this month. China overtook  Japan  as the largest
buyer of  iron ore  in 2003 as it increased production of cars,
buildings and appliances.  
 Kloppers also reiterated that BHP would only be interested
in investing in aluminum plants should there be sufficient power
available nearby. He declined to specify sites under examination,
except to say they may be in ``challenging locations.''  
 ``The aluminum industry is a business we are interested
in,'' he said. He declined to answer a question on whether BHP
would be interested in bidding for aluminum producer  Alcoa Inc. (AA)   
 BHP is seeing ``very favorable conditions for all our
products,'' Kloppers said. BHP is the world's largest exporter
of coal used in steel, and also sells copper, nickel, oil, gas,
sliver, lead and aluminum.
