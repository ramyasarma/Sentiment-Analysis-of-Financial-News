             Russian shares advanced, led by OAO
Gazprom and OAO Lukoil, as crude traded near a record high. OAO
Severstal, Russia's biggest steel company, jumped 4.3 percent
after a broker upgraded the shares.  
 The ruble-denominated  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 1.9 percent to
1,666.49, its biggest gain since Aug. 31. The dollar-denominated
 RTS Index (RTSI$)  increased 1.7 percent to 1,932.68.  
 Crude hovered close to $80 a barrel in New York after U.S.
stockpiles dropped more than forecast yesterday. Energy
companies make up the biggest part of Russian equity indexes.  
 ``We've got a very high oil price, and the market is
definitely buoyed by that,'' said Tom Mundy, a strategist at
 Renaissance Capital  in Moscow.  
 Lukoil climbed 1.6 percent to 1,930.48 rubles on the Micex
Stock Exchange. Russia's second-biggest oil producer has
earmarked $9 billion to buy refineries and retail operations in
Europe, the Financial Times reported. Lukoil will earn an extra
$1 billion a year from refining oil there rather than selling
crude, the newspaper wrote, citing Chief Executive Officer
 Leonid Fedun .  
 Gazprom, the world's biggest natural-gas producer, rose 2.5
percent to 269.01 rubles, its biggest advance in more than a
month. OAO Gazprom Neft, its oil unit, won tenders for two
oilfields in eastern Siberia that may be used to fill a future
crude pipeline to Asia.  
 Non-energy stocks recovered some of yesterday's losses
triggered by President  Vladimir Putin 's decision to nominate
 Viktor Zubkov , head of the country's money-laundering watchdog,
as the next prime minister.

 The nomination ``shows that Russia is prioritizing the
economy and the financial system,'' said Daniel Broby, chief
investment officer at Renaissance Investment Management in
 London .  
 OAO Unified Energy System, the stock with the biggest
trading volume on the Micex, climbed 1.1 percent to 30.062
rubles after tumbling 2.6 percent yesterday. OAO Sberbank,
Russia's biggest bank, added 2.4 percent to 96.28 rubles.  
 Severstal jumped 4.3 percent to 457.33 rubles. UBS AG
raised its price estimate for the stock 7.7 percent to $21 (532
rubles), citing the steelmaker's ``cheap'' valuation compared
with global peers.
