             Iron-ore  prices charged to
steelmakers will have to rise in response to surging demand in
the spot market,  Cia. Vale do Rio Doce 's Chief Executive Officer
 Roger Agnelli  said.  
 ``There are a lot of distortions in the market,'' Agnelli
told investors and analysts today in a Webcast from the  New York 
Stock Exchange. ``The only way to resolve this is a rise in
price.''  
 Vale,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group, the three
biggest iron-ore suppliers, expect to begin talks with Chinese
steelmakers next month to set world contract prices for 2008.
China's spot-market prices are more than double Vale's contract
price of about $45 a metric ton, said Jose Carlos Martins,
Vale's iron-ore chief.  
 Chinese steelmakers and Vale are ``far apart'' on how much
contract prices will have to rise, Martins said. China pays spot
prices on imports of about 300 million tons a year, an
``unsustainable'' amount, he said. Agnelli said Vale may sell
more iron ore in the  spot market  if it doesn't get a big enough
price increase.  
 ``We don't want to increase our spot market sales,''
Agnelli said. ``It's in everyone's interest to set a benchmark
contract price.''  
 Vale plans to spend $11 billion expanding output of iron-
ore, copper, nickel and other minerals next year, part of a
$56 billion, five-year expansion.
