             Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , the bond
insurer that posted losses of $5.2 billion related to mortgage-
linked securities last quarter, said its chief risk officer
resigned.  
 William McKinnon left on Feb. 8, the New York-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. McKinnon had been with Ambac,
the world's second-largest bond insurer, since at least 1989,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 McKinnon was in charge of risk while Ambac expanded beyond
insuring municipal debt to guaranteeing collateralized debt
obligations and subprime mortgage-related securities. Ambac had
its first-ever and biggest  losses  in the third and fourth
quarters as the value of those securities tumbled.  
 McKinnon was one of four executive officers to be awarded a
bonus for 2007, according to a company regulatory filing last
week. McKinnon received an $800,000 bonus, $425,000 in restricted
stock and options to buy 32,500 additional shares at $11.13 each.  
 Ambac  shares  plunged 71 percent last year. The stock rose
47 cents to $9.37 today in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading.
