             H&R Block Inc. , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell as the company
lost market share and U.S. unemployment remained near 10
percent.  
 Net income  for the three months ended April 30 was $690.8
million, or $2.10 a share, compared with $706.9 million, or
$2.08, in the same period last year, the Kansas City, Missouri-
based company said today in a statement. Profit from continuing
operations was $2.11 a share, compared with the $2.04 average
 estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Russ Smyth  closed 400 under-
performing tax offices and cut 400 jobs after the company said
it wouldn’t reach its fiscal 2010 earnings forecast. TurboTax
maker  Intuit Inc. , which has taken market share, said unit sales
of its Web-based software increased 18 percent for 2010 as of
May 20.  
 “Our business results reflect the challenging economic
conditions of this tax season, caused by record levels of
sustained unemployment that led to fewer returns being filed by
our core retail tax client base,” Symth said in a statement.  
 The company expects the job cuts and office closings to
decrease annual operating expenses by $140 million to $150
million by the end of fiscal 2012.  
 H&R Block fell 41 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $14.96 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 34 percent this year through today’s close.  
 H&R Block declined 12 percent, its steepest plunge in 22
years, after announcing Feb. 24 that the company wouldn’t meet
its previous 2010 earnings forecast of $1.60 to $1.80 a share.  
 Total tax returns prepared from March 1 through April 15
rose 0.3 percent compared to the same period last year, and
digital tax returns advanced 5.9 percent, the company said on
April 21.
