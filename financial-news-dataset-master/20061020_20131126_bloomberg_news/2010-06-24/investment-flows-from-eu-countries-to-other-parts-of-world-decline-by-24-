             Investment by the 27 European Union
countries in the rest of the world declined by almost one-
quarter last year as governments struggled to emerge from the
worst recession since World War II.  
 Foreign direct investment from the EU nations to other
areas totaled 263 billion euros ($323 billion) in 2009, down 24
percent from 348 billion euros in the prior year, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Investment
inflows into the EU increased 12 percent to 222 billion euros,
it said.  
 The main destination for EU funds remained the U.S.,
although investment flows fell 43 percent to 69 billion euros
from 121 billion euros in 2008, according to today’s report. EU
investment flows also declined to Russia, Canada, Hong Kong and
Japan.  
 The U.S. also was the primary source of investment flows
into the EU, rising to 97 billion euros last year from 50
billion euros in 2008. Investments into the EU also increased
from Switzerland, while they declined from Canada, Brazil and
Japan, the report showed.
