             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a  yield  of 1.5704 percent in  open market
operations , unchanged for the first time since May 20, according
to traders at China CITIC Bank and China Development Bank.  
 The central bank has allowed the rate to rise in the last
four auctions to attract bids from finance companies. The
monetary authority  offered  5 billion yuan ($734 million) of the
securities at the sale today, the smallest issue of three-month
bills this year.
