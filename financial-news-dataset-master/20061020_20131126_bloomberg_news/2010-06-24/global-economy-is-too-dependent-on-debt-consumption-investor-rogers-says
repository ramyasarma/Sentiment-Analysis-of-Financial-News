             The world will have “more economic
problems” because it depends on “too much debt and too much
consumption,” investor Jim Rogers said.  
 “I’m short stocks and long commodities,” Rogers said by
phone from Hong Kong today. “America of all things they think
the solution to too much debt and too much consumption is more
debt and more consumption. Which means they are going to print
even more money.”
