             Chile’s government will sell as much
as $3 billion in bonds locally in the second half of the year as
it seeks funds to rebuild infrastructure damaged by the biggest
earthquake in half a century.  
 Authorities will disclose terms of the sale tomorrow,
Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said today from the central
Chilean town of Melipilla. Plans include a new seven-year issue
of 24 million unidades de fomento, Chile’s inflation-adjusted
accounting unit, or $946 million, he said.  
 President  Sebastian Pinera ’s government is raising funds to
finance $8.4 billion in reconstruction work after the 8.8-
magnitude quake and ensuing tsunami smashed ports, roads and
factories. The financing package aims to protect exchange rate
stability, Larrain said today.  
 “If we increase our debt domestically we’ll bring in less
funds from abroad and as a result generate better conditions for
our exchange rate,” he said.  
 Larrain said April 23 in New York that Chile plans to sell
$1.5 billion worth of 10-year dollar and peso bonds abroad this
year. The South American country may sell as much as $3 billion
of bonds and warrants, according to a June 15 filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Chile’s peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 537.25 per U.S.
dollar, reducing a decline this year to 5.6 percent.
