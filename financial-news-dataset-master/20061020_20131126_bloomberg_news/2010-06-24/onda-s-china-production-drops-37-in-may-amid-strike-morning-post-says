             Honda Motor, Japan’s No. 2 carmaker,
said its China production fell 37 percent last month from April
after the first in a series of labor strikes, Hong Kong’s South
China Morning Post said today. The company’s China sales dropped
10 percent from a year earlier in May, the English-language
paper said, quoting figures from consultancy JP Power and
Associates.
