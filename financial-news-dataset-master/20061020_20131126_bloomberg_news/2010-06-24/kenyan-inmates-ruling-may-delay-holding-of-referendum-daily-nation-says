             A Kenyan court ruling that prisoners
can vote in an Aug. 4 referendum on a new constitution may delay
the poll as registration has closed, the  Daily Nation  reported,
citing senior members of the Interim Independent Electoral
Commission.  
 The ruling by a dispute resolution court yesterday followed
a complaint by human rights group, Kituo Cha Sheria, that
excluding inmates from the vote would violate their rights under
the current constitution, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported.  
 The decision opens up voting to about 53,000 inmates in 90
prisons across the East African nation, the Daily Nation said.
The time it will take to verify the identity of that many people
may go beyond the Aug. 4 vote, the newspaper reported, citing
Kimani Muhoro, a lawyer with the IIEC.
