             Almost three quarters of financial
industry workers in a German survey said the worst of the euro
crisis hasn’t been overcome.  
 Sixty-eight percent said they still see the euro in danger,
according to a survey of 384 financial industry professionals by
the  eFinancialCareers.de  Web site. Half of the participants said
they work in senior management or are management board members,
it said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Seventy-eight percent said they expect G20 nations won’t be
able to agree on an overhaul of bankers’ compensation in the
next 12 months. Forty-four percent of those polled said they are
in favor of introducing a bank levy in Germany to create a fund
for future bank bailouts, while 19 percent said no new taxes
should be introduced, according to the survey.
