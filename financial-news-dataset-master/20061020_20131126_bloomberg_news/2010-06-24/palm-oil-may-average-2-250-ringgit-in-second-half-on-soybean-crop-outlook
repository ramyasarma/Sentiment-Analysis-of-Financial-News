             Palm oil prices will drop in the
second half as a record soybean crop makes the outlook for the
tropical commodity “mildly bearish,” Maybank Investment Bank
Bhd. said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Palm oil may average 2,250 ringgit ($699) a metric ton in
the second half, from 2,548 ringgit so far this year, on the
Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, plantation analyst Tan Chi Wei
said in the report.  
 Palm oil for September delivery, the most-active contract,
gained 0.2 percent to 2,389 ringgit a ton at 11:56 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Palm oil is the world’s cheapest edible oil and soybean
oil is a direct substitute for use in food and biofuels.  
 “Our mildly bearish view on prices centers on expectations
of a record soybean crop in 2010,” said Tan. “We expect
vegetable oil prices to trend down in the second half.”  
 The U.S., Brazil and Argentina are the largest producers of
soybeans, and a record harvest is forecast this year after
drought ravaged the South American crop last year.  
 OilWorld, an industry publication, raised its forecast for
global output of 10 oilseeds for 2010-2011 to a record 438.8
million tons. Its South American crop forecast is 136 million
tons, from 97 million tons last year, it said on June 11.  
 “The current parity of palm and soya oil prices” should
“return to trend,” leaving palm oil at a discount, Tan said.  
 Malaysia palm olein  traded at $803.50 a ton on June 22,
while  degummed Argentina soybean oil  was at $791.23 a ton
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “Palm olein is not only not at a discount, but at a
premium lately,” said  Ben Santoso , a plantation analyst at DBS
Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte. “The pressure is on crude
palm oil to fall.”  
 Soybean oil for December delivery in Chicago gained 0.5
percent to 38.73 cents a pound, trimming this year’s losses to 5
percent. Palm oil has dropped 10 percent.  
 “Supplies of soybeans have become ample,” and stockpiles
will be “substantial” until August, which will have a bearish
impact on edible oils prices, OilWorld said in a weekly report
on June 11.
