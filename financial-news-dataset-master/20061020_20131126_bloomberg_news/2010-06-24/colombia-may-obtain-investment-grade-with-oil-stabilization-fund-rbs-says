             Colombia may obtain an investment-
grade rating should it follow through with plans to create an
oil stabilization fund for “counter-cyclical” savings and to
pay down debt, RBS Securities Inc. said.  
 “Follow-through action on an oil stabilization fund and
fiscal responsibility law should provide the necessary catalyst
for the investment-grade ratings from Moody’s and Fitch and
reaffirm our convergence trade on external credit spreads to the
high-grade pack over the next 3-6 months,”  Siobhan Morden , head
of Latin America strategy at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, wrote
in a report today.  
 Colombia’s bonds are rated Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service
and BB+ by Fitch Ratings, which are both one level below
investment grade. Standard & Poor’s rates the bonds at BBB-, the
lowest level of investment grade, and the government at BB+, one
notch below.
