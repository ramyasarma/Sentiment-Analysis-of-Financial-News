             U.S.  mortgage rates  fell to a record
low, reducing borrowing costs for homebuyers as sales slump
after the expiration of a government tax credit.  
 Rates for 30-year fixed loans declined to 4.69 percent in
the week ended today from 4.75 percent, mortgage-finance company
Freddie Mac said in a statement today. The previous record was
4.71 percent, set in the week ended Dec. 3. The average 15-year
 rate  was 4.13 percent, McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac said.  
 “The overall level of real estate activity is low, but low
mortgage rates will help in generating some growth,”  George Mokrzan , senior economist at Huntington National Bank in
Columbus, Ohio, said in a telephone interview. “It’s going to
be off very low levels.”  
 Borrowing costs have tumbled in the past two months as
concern that a debt crisis in Europe may spread boosted demand
for the safety of bonds including mortgage-backed securities.
The lower rates have failed to lift housing demand, which has
tumbled since a tax credit for first-time and certain other
buyers expired at the end of April.  
 The average price of $5.2 trillion of bonds guaranteed by
government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or federal
agency Ginnie Mae climbed to 106.3 cents on the dollar
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Mortgage
Master Index. That’s up from 104.2 cents on March 31, when the
Federal Reserve ended its program purchasing $1.25 trillion of
the debt.  
 Recovery Stalls  
 High  unemployment  and the supply of foreclosed homes for
sale are slowing the housing recovery.  Foreclosures  may reach
1.9 million this year after a record 2 million in 2009,
according to  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s Analytics
Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  
 Economic growth may be sluggish if housing demand continues
to fall. The U.S. economy will expand 3 percent from July
through September, down from 3.3 percent this quarter and 5.6
percent in the final three months of 2009, according to the
median forecast of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 U.S.  new home sales  sank 33 percent to an annual pace of
300,000, the lowest level on record, in May, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. Existing-home sales  decreased  2.2
percent from April to a 5.66 million annual rate, National
Association of Realtors data showed June 22.  
 The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of  mortgage 
applications fell 5.9 percent in the week ended June 18. The
portion of  refinancings  slumped 7.3 percent. Applications to
 purchase  a home declined 1.2 percent.
