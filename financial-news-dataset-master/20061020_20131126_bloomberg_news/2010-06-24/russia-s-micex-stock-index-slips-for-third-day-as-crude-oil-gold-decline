             Russian  stocks fell , headed for the
lowest level in a week, as oil retreated and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. downgraded Russian gold producers.  
 OAO Polymetal  and  OAO Polyus Gold  slid 2.9 percent and 2
percent respectively.  OAO Rosneft , the country’s biggest oil
company, fell 1.9 percent. The Micex dropped 1.2 percent to
1,360.05 as of 3:47 p.m. in Moscow, poised for its lowest close
since June 17.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, retreated as much
as 1.1 percent to $75.55 a barrel, and gold for immediate
delivery slumped 0.4 percent to $1,232.23 an ounce. Gold has
“reduced upside potential” as investors seek riskier assets
such as steel, Goldman analyst  Vasily Nikolaev  wrote in a report
dated today.  
 The Micex tracked declines in European stocks, as concern
increased that the region’s debt crisis may derail the economic
recovery. U.S. stocks fell yesterday as the Federal Reserve
signaled that European indebtedness may harm American growth.  
 “Russia is closely following oil price and European debt
concerns,”  Tom Mundy , strategist at Renaissance Capital, said
by phone today.  
 Russian stocks, the world’s best performers last year as an
economic recovery boosted the earnings outlook of oil and metals
producers, have retreated 11 percent from their April 15 peak on
concern economic growth may slow.
