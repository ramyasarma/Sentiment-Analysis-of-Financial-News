             The Nigerian  Senate  unanimously
approved the appointment of Attahiru Jega as chairman of the
 Independent National Electoral Commission , which runs elections
in Africa’s most populous country.  
 Jega was confirmed as head of the electoral agency, Senate
President David Mark said after a vote today in Abuja, the
capital. The senate also approved six nominees as electoral
commissioners to assist Jega in conducting future polls in the
West African country.  
 “They need to be transparent” in the conduct of next
year’s general elections, Mark said.  
 President  Goodluck Jonathan  on June 8 nominated Jega, the
vice chancellor of Bayero University in the northern city of
Kano, to replace  Maurice Iwu . He will oversee general elections
due to be held by April in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil
producer. The last vote, held in 2007, was marred by widespread
irregularities such as violence and ballot-stuffing, according
to local and foreign observers.  
 Jonathan, who succeeded  Umaru Yar’Adua , who died on May 5,
has vowed to make next year’s vote credible. He said on June 21
that it was too soon to announce whether he would be a candidate
because it would damage his government’s effectiveness.  
 Nigeria, with more than 140 million people, has suffered
periodic outbursts of religious and communal violence that have
claimed more than 13,000 lives since 1999, according to
Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  
 Army officers have seized power six times since Nigeria’s
independence from the U.K. in 1960, once sparking a civil war
from 1967 to 1970.
