             Gaz-System SA, Poland’s state-owned 
gas pipeline operator, and Lithuania’s gas supplier Lietuvos 
Dujos AB agreed to build a link between the two countries and 
may sign a letter of intent as early as next month, Rp.pl said,
citing Gaz-System’s Chief Executive Officer Jan Chadam.  
 The 360-kilometer (224-mile) Polish part of the pipeline 
could cost as much as 1.1 billion zloty ($334 million), Chadam 
told the website of the Rzeczpospolita newspaper.  
 Lithuania could initially import about 2 billion cubic 
meters of the fuel a year using the pipeline’s connection to 
Poland’s planned liquefied natural gas terminal, Rp.pl said, 
without citing anyone.
