             Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. , the
independent studio battling a takeover bid by  Carl Icahn , has
held merger talks with  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. , a person with
the knowledge of the situation said.  
 No offer has been made, and Vancouver-based Lions Gate
won’t be able to move ahead without backing from Icahn, the
largest investor with a 32 percent stake, said the person, who
requested anonymity because the discussions aren’t public.  
 Icahn, 74, has been battling for control of Lions Gate,
distributor of the “Saw” horror films, since February. The
billionaire investor has criticized the company for spending too
much and announced on June 11 that he plans a proxy fight for
board seats. Lions Gate has said his $7-a-share offer is too
low. Investors have until June 30 to tender shares.  
 Susie Arons , a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based MGM,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone call seeking
comment after normal business hours. The closely held studio put
itself up for sale last year after falling behind on interest
payments on $3.7 billion of debt. The Los Angeles Times reported
Lions Gate’s renewed interest in MGM yesterday.  
 Lions Gate told Icahn last year of its interest in MGM,
which co-owns film rights to the James Bond movies and the
J.R.R. Tolkien novel “The Hobbit,” according to a March 24
statement from the studio.  
 Icahn didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  
 Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, rose 6 cents
to $7.06 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange  trading . The
shares have gained 22 percent this year.
