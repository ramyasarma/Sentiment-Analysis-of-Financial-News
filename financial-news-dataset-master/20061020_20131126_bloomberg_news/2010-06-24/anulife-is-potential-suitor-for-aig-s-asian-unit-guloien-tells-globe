             Manulife Financial Corp.  may be a
“potential suitor,” for American International Group Inc.’s
main Asian unit, Chief Executive Officer  Donald Guloien  told the
Globe and Mail newspaper.  
 Guloien said there is a “huge amount” of interest from
investors in seeing Toronto-based Manulife “pursue a deal like
that,” for AIA Group Ltd., the paper said, citing an interview
with the chief executive.  
 Prudential Plc terminated a $35.5 billion agreement to buy
AIA Group after Prudential shareholders balked at the cost and
New York-based AIG refused to cut the price. Guloien said
Manulife wouldn’t consider a purchase “approaching” that
price.
