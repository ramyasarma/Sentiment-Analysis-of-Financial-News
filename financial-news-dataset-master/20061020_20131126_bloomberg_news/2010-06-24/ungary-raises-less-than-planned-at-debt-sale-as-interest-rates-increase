             Hungary raised less than its target
in a second straight auction of 12-month Treasury bills and the
nation’s cost of borrowing increased as concern mounted that
Europe’s debt crisis may escalate.  
 The state debt management agency sold 40 billion forint
($174 million) of bills, 10 billion forint less than planned, at
a yield of 5.41 percent compared with 5.35 percent on June 10,
according to the agency’s Bloomberg page. Investors bid for 57.5
billion forint of bonds, compared with 57.3 billion on June 10,
when the agency sold 35 billion forint of bonds, less than an
initial objective of 50 billion forint.  
 “Sentiment is bad at the moment,” said  Egon Hajdu ,
director at CIB Alapkezelo, the fund management arm of Intesa
Sanpaolo Spa’s local unit. “We’re living through sad days as
investors shy away from risk on a global level. This is not a
Hungary-specific issue.”  
 Hungary, which had to resort to an International Monetary
Fund-led bailout to avoid default in 2008, rattled international
markets after officials from the ruling Fidesz party on June 3
and 4 compared the country’s finances to those of Greece. Stocks
fell worldwide today and the cost to protect against a Greek
default rose to a record.  
 The cost of insuring Hungarian debt against default climbed
for a third day, with credit default swaps gaining to 320.4
basis points from 314 basis points at yesterday’s close,
according to CMA DataVision prices. The contracts, which rise in
value as risk perception increases, advanced to as high as
410.24 basis points on June 4.  
 The forint weakened 1.2 percent to 283.86 per euro as of
6:22 p.m. in Budapest, the lowest intraday level since June 9.  
 Hungary’s government on June 7 pledged to meet its deficit
target after unveiling austerity measures including wage cuts in
the public sector and a new tax on banks.
