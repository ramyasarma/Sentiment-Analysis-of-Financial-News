             European Central Bank President  Jean- Claude Trichet  said the credibility of austerity measures taken
by governments needs to be kept constantly under control, la
Repubblica reported, citing an interview with him.  
 Measures taken by Italy are going in the “right
direction,” Trichet said, according to la Repubblica. It’s
wrong to think that austerity measures taken
by governments such as Germany strangle a recovery, the
newspaper reported.
