             Demand for Nigeria’s three- and 20-
year bonds climbed to the highest level in three months at a
government sale yesterday in which 80 billion naira ($529
million) of debt was sold, the Debt Management Office said.  
 Orders for 30 billion naira of bonds due February 2013
exceeded the amount offered more than threefold, compared with a
4.2 percent oversubscription in May and 22 percent in April,
according to details published on the  website  of the Abuja-based
debt office.  
 Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, plans to sell 867.5
billion naira of bonds this year to fund a budget deficit due to
a drop in oil revenue,  Abraham Nwankwo , director-general of the
Debt Management Office, said on Feb. 12.  
 Investors wanted more than three times the 20 billion naira
on offer of bonds that mature in November 2029. This compares
with oversubscriptions of 45 percent in May and 71 percent in
April.  
 The yield on the three-year bonds declined to 6.24 percent
compared with 8.25 percent at the May sale. The five-year
securities will pay 7.6 percent, down from 9 percent last month.
The interest on the 20-year debt retreated to 8.69 percent from
10 percent at the previous auction.
