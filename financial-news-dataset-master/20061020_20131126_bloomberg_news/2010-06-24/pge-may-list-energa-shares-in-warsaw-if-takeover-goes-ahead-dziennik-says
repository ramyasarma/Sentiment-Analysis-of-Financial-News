             PGE SA, the Polish state-controlled 
utility that’s one of the five companies bidding to buy a 
majority stake in power group Energa SA from the country’s 
government, may sell part of the target’s shares on the Warsaw 
stock exchange if it’s picked to purchase the rival, Dziennik 
Gazeta Prawna reported, citing PGE’s Chief Executive Officer 
Tomasz Zadroga.  
 The possible initial public offering of Energa, Poland’s 
fourth-largest power group, could happen at the end of 2011 and
PGE, the country’s biggest utility, would like to retain a 
controlling stake after the deal, Zadroga told the newspaper.
