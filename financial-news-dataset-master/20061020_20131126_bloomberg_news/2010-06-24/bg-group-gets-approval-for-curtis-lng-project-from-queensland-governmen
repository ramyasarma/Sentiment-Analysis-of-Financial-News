             BG Group Plc  said it won approval
for an Australian liquefied natural gas project that may cost
A$15 billion ($13 billion) after the Queensland government
completed a review of the environmental impact statement.  
 Australian federal government environmental approval is
expected by about mid-year, QGC Pty Ltd., the Australian unit of
BG Group, said in an e-mailed statement today. Production
licenses, safety approvals and other environmental permits are
required before construction can start, Brisbane-based QGC said.  
 BG,  Santos Ltd.  and Origin Energy Ltd. are among companies
proposing to develop liquefied gas projects in Queensland
converting coal-seam gas into the fuel for export to Asia. BG’s
Queensland Curtis LNG venture will initially produce about 8.5
million metric tons of LNG a year and is expected to generate
more than 5,000 jobs during construction.  
 A development decision will be considered “later this year
subject to acceptable fiscal terms and environmental
approvals,”  Catherine Tanna , managing director or QGC, said in
the statement. First exports are targeted for 2014, QGC said.
