             Sugar prices rose in New York for
the first time in three days on speculation that a drop in
seasonal rain in India, the world’s largest consumer of the
sweetener, may lead to a smaller harvest.  
 India’s monsoon, the main source of irrigation for the
nation’s 235 million farmers, was 21 percent below average in
the week ended June 23, the India Meteorological Department said
today on its website. Sugar prices have jumped 14 percent this
month as demand increased from importing countries.  
 “The short-term fundamentals are strong,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida.
“Also, there is some concern about India’s rainfall.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery advanced 0.38 cent, or 2.4
percent, to 16.19 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Last year, prices more than doubled after excess rains in Brazil
and a weak monsoon in India crimped output.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, white-sugar futures for October
delivery rose $3.20, or 0.7 percent, to $468.10 a metric ton,
the first increase in three sessions.  
 Thailand, the largest sugar exporter after Brazil, will
retain 4.5 percent more of its production for domestic
consumption to ease tightening supplies, the Office of the Cane
and Sugar Board said today. Exports may fall 2.2 percent, to 4.6
million tons, said  Prasert Tapaneeyangkul , the agency’s
secretary general.
