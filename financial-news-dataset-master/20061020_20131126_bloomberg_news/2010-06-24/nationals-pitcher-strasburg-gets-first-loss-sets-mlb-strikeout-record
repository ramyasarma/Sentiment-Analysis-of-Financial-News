             Stephen Strasburg  set another Major
League Baseball pitching record while suffering his first loss
last night when the Kansas City Royals beat the Washington
Nationals 1-0.  
 Strasburg (2-1) got his 41st strikeout in his fourth major
league start to break the record held by  Herb Score , who struck
out 40 by the same stage of his career for Cleveland in 1955.  
 The 21-year-old Strasburg allowed nine hits, one run and no
walks while striking out nine batters in six innings at
Nationals Park in Washington. Of his 95 pitches, 75 were
strikes. The right-hander also got his first major league hit --
a ground-ball single in the third inning.  
 “They didn’t really hit the ball hard, except for a
couple times,” Strasburg said. “They just found holes and
that’s baseball.”  
 Jose Guillen  singled off Strasburg in the second inning to
extend his hitting streak to 18 games while driving in Kansas
City’s only run.  
 “The number of runs that cross the plate is the biggest
issue and they only got one across there, so I thought he did
another great job,” Nationals Manager  Jim Riggleman  said after
the game.  
 Brian Bannister  (7-5) allowed five hits and walked two in
six innings.  Joakim Soria  got his 17th save to improve the
Royals’ record to 30-43.
