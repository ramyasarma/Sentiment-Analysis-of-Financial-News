             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell this week against the yen on concern a slowing
global recovery will sap demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 “Risk sentiment is weakening as a number of economic data
points are now showing the global recovery slowing,” said
 Hiroshi Yanagisawa , a Tokyo-based dealer at FX Prime Corp., a
foreign-exchange unit of the Japanese trading house Itochu Corp.
“Growth-related currencies such as the Aussie are hostage to
selling pressure.”  
 The Aussie depreciated 0.2 percent to 77.50 yen at 11:38
a.m. in New York, from 77.66 yesterday, extending its weekly
decline to 2 percent. New Zealand’s dollar decreased 0.2 percent
to 63.36 yen, from 63.49, and fell 1.2 percent for the week.  
 U.S. reports this week showed purchases of new homes fell
in May to the lowest level on record, and sales of previously
owned homes also declined. The Fed reiterated after its June 22-
23 policy meeting that it intends to keep interest rates
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.”
