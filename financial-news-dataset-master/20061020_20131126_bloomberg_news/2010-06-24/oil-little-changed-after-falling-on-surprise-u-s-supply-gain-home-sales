             Crude oil fell to near its lowest
price in a week as growing U.S. inventories reinforced doubts
about the economic recovery, while equities fell and a stronger
dollar against the euro reduced oil’s investment appeal.  
 The U.S. Energy Department reported yesterday crude
 stockpiles  rose more than analysts expected. The International
Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-consuming nations, said that
growth in world oil demand will slow in the next five years as
the pace of Chinese consumption moderates.  
 “The supply situation in the oil market remains very
relaxed as crude inventories are increasing in defiance of their
normal seasonal pattern,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of
commodity research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  
 Crude for August delivery traded at $75.78 a barrel, down
57 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 12:54 p.m. London time. It earlier fell as much as
80 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $75.55 a barrel. Brent crude oil
for August delivery was down 46 cents at $75.81 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  
 Yesterday crude dropped to $75.17, its lowest since June
15, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.02 million barrels to
365.1 million in the week ended June 18. Supplies were forecast
to drop 800,000 barrels, according to analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Imports  of crude climbed 4.3 percent to 10.1 million
barrels a day, the highest level since the week ended Jan. 2,
2009, the Energy Department report showed. Fuel imports surged
10 percent to 2.32 million barrels a day.  
 Gasoline Stockpiles Fall  
 Gasoline  supplies  fell 762,000 barrels to 217.6 million
last week. An 180,000-barrel drop was forecast, according to the
median of 15 responses in the survey.  
 Refineries operated at 89.4 percent of capacity, up 1.5
percentage points from the prior week and the highest level
since April, the report showed.  
 The dollar advanced to as much as $1.2262 against the euro
from $1.2311 yesterday, and traded at $1.2280 at 12:54 a.m.
London time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell as much as 1.1
percent.  
 The IEA estimates that the rate of annual demand growth
will shrink each year until 2015. Consumption will climb 1
percent to 91.93 million barrels a day in 2015, down from 1.5
percent growth in 2010, according to the Paris-based agency’s
Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2010 report.  
 “Sentiment is still pretty weak,” said  Ben Westmore , a
minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
Melbourne. “On the demand front, it’s still negative and still
very uncertain.”  
 China Demand Outlook  
 Chinese oil demand is expected to reach 11.63 million
barrels a day by 2015, up from 9.16 million this year, according
to the IEA data. The pace is slowing, with consumption rising
4.1 percent in 2015, compared with 7.6 percent this year,
according to the report.  
 The rate of consumption decline in developed economies is
accelerating. Total demand from the 30 industrialized countries
that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development will drop 0.9 percent in 2015 compared with a 0.1
percent fall in 2010, the agency estimates.
