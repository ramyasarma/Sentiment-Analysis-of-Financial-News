             The Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, an international watchdog, may relax proposed bank
core capital rules, Nikkei English News reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 European countries had wanted the new requirements to help
prevent another financial crisis and a preliminary review based
on the new rules found European banks’ core capital would
decline, Nikkei said.
