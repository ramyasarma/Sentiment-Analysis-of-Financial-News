             Telkom Kenya, a unit of  France
Telecom SA , said it plans to set up a third-generation network
in the east African nation by the end of the year, after the
industry regulator lowered the cost of 3G operator licenses.  
 The  Communications Commission of Kenya  announced this month
it had cut the price of a 3G permit by 60 percent to $10 million
to boost competition.  
 “We wanted the fee to go down to $3 million and on the
higher side $10 million,” Angela Mumo, the company’s head of
corporate communications, said by phone from the capital Nairobi
today. “Now we can confirm we are taking out a 3G license. We
will roll out 3G in quarter four.”  
 Telkom Kenya is running a 3G pilot program it began in
December in about 10 locations for corporate customers, Mumo
said, adding that the new network will enable subscribers to get
quicker wireless Internet, voice and data services.  
 Safaricom Ltd.  holds the only 3G permit in Kenya and the
company plans to seek a partial refund for the $25 million it
spent in 2007 to acquire it, the Business Daily reported on June
11, citing Chief Executive Officer Michael Joseph.  
 Safaricom, East Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator,
and Telkom Kenya compete with  Zain Kenya Ltd. , a unit of Bharti
Airtel of India, and Essar Telecom Kenya Ltd., a unit of India’s
Essar Group.  
 Zain is at a “very advanced stage” of deploying a 3G
network and welcomes the licensing fee cut, Managing Director
Rene Meza said on June 18.
