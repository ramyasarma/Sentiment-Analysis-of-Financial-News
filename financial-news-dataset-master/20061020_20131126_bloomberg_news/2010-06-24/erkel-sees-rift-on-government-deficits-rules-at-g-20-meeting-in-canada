             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
she expects conflict at the Group of 20 summit in Canada this
week on issues ranging from economic policy to financial
regulation.  
 Europeans and especially “Germans are of the opinion that
the reduction of deficits is absolutely necessary to create
sustainable economic growth,” Merkel told reporters at the
Chancellery in Berlin today before leaving for Canada. “There
are others who don’t see the exit strategy as we see it; I think
there will be very fruitful but also controversial debates on
these themes.”  
 Merkel’s comments underscore a divergence with President
 Barack Obama , who in a letter to his G-20 counterparts dated
June 16 urged a focus on economic growth, saying order to public
finances should be restored in the “medium term.”  
 Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper , in his own letter
to G-20 leaders, said June 18 that he wanted agreement on a
target of reducing deficits by half by 2013, and to stabilize or
begin reducing their ratios of debt-to-output by 2016.  
 The European Union is wary of such targets because Europe’s
goals are more ambitious, according to a senior EU finance
official, who said the proposals by Canada should be the
minimum.  
 Merkel said June 11 that she expects to have a “hard
time” at the summit, with pressure from fellow leaders to boost
growth while she sees “no alternative” to budget cuts.  
 “One area that will be discussed is how to make the
financial sector contribute to the costs of the crisis,” Merkel
also said today. “I don’t expect agreement across the board
here, but I’m happy that we found a common position in Europe as
regards a banking fee as well as a global financial-market
transaction tax.”
