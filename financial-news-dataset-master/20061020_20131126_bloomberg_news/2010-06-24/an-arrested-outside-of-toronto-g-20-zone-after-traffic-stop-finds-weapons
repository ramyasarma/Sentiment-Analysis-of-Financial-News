             A man was arrested and taken into
custody outside of the Group of 20 security zone after  Toronto 
police found weapons and hazardous materials inside his vehicle,
Constable Tony Vella said.  
 “At 1:04 p.m., officers conducted a traffic stop on a
vehicle at 45 The Esplanade,” Vella said. “An array of weapons
and hazardous materials were seized,” he said. The items
included a chain saw, axe handle, sticks and fuel containers,
said Nena Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Integrated Security Unit
for the G-20 summit.  
 “There’s no indication that it’s G-20 related,” Snyder
said. The investigation continues and the man has not been
charged at this time, she added.  
 CP24 Television  reported a 53-year-old white man was
arrested after his silver Hyundai with an Ontario license plate
and topped with a large box was stopped, citing police.  
 Earlier today, Toronto police arrested and charged a woman
on weapons possession in an earlier probe linked to the G-20
summit.  Kristen Peterson , 37, was charged with possession of an
explosive device and possession of a weapon for a dangerous
purpose.  
 Snyder couldn’t immediately determine the number of people
arrested or charged in connection with the G-20 summit in
Toronto this weekend.  
 The city’s financial district is surrounded by metal fences
and concrete barriers as part of the largest security operation
ever in the country.
