             Japan’s output of copper and copper-
alloy fabricated products, including sheets and tubes, rose 29
percent in June, increasing for the eighth straight month as the
country’s export-led economy expanded, an industry group said.  
 Production was 76,410 metric tons last month, the highest
level since Nov. 2008, from 59,188 tons a year ago, the Japan
Copper and Brass  Association  said today, citing preliminary data.
Output totaled 72,605 tons in May.  
 Copper, used in pipes and wires, has risen 27 percent in
the past year as the global economy recovers from recession and
increase demand. Japan’s exports rose faster than economists
estimated last month, sustaining the country’s recovery.  
 “Output rose above 76,000 tons for the first time since
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,” Keizo Tani, the
association’s research section manager, told reporters today in
Tokyo. “With brisk demand from the semiconductor sector, the
current pace of demand recovery this year is slightly higher
than we had expected in March.”  
 The industry group forecast in March that output may rise
15 percent to 855,000 tons for the year started April 1. The
production plunged to 754,014 tons in the year ended March 31,
the lowest level since the year ended March 31, 1978.  
 Japan’s total  exports  rose 27.7 percent in June from a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said July 26. The median estimate
of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 23.5 percent.
From a month earlier, exports fell 1.8 percent.  
 The country’s copper wire and cable shipments climbed 5
percent to 56,100 tons in June from a year earlier, gaining for
the sixth month, the  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’
Association  said July 23. Shipments totaled 49,708 tons in May.  
 Shipments rose to 330,977 tons in the January to June
period after declining to 305,818 tons in the same period a year
earlier, the lowest level since the six-month period in 1975,
the industry group said.
