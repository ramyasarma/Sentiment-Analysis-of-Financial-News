             China Construction Bank Corp. , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, won shareholder
approval for a plan to raise as much as 75 billion yuan ($11
billion) in a rights offer.  
 Investors approved the  plan  at a shareholder meeting in
Hong Kong today, Chairman  Guo Shuqing  said in the city today.
Under the plan, first announced in April, the lender will offer
as many as 0.7 shares for every 10 held, or as many as 630
million shares in Shanghai and about 15.7 billion in Hong Kong,  
 The sale will bring to about $25 billion the amount of
money being raised by China’s  four biggest publicly traded banks 
after they extended record  loans  last year to support a
government-led stimulus. China’s banks stayed profitable during
the financial crisis, enabling them to increase lending even as
U.S. and European banks restrained credit.  
 Shares  of Beijing-based Construction Bank gained 0.2
percent in Hong Kong today as of 3:45 p.m. local time. The stock
was suspended from trading in Shanghai today because of the
shareholder meeting.
