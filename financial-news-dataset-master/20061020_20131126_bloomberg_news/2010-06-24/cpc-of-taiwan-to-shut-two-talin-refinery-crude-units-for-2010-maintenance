             --  CPC Corp. , Taiwan’s state-owned
oil company, plans to shut two crude processing units at its
Talin refinery this year for maintenance.  
 The No. 10 crude distillation unit will be halted for five
weeks starting late September and the No. 11 plant will be
closed for five to six weeks starting late November, Vice-
President  Lin Maw-wen  said in a telephone interview in Taipei
yesterday. CPC will also shut a fuel-oil unit, known as a
residue desulfurizer, at its Taoyuan refinery in August for
regular repairs, he said.  
 CPC ’s three refineries -- Kaohsiung and Talin, also spelt
as Dalin, in Kaohsiung City and Taoyuan -- have a combined
processing capacity of 720,000 barrels of crude a day. The crude
distillation units separate the fuel into oil products and form
the main part of a refinery.  
 The crude units in Talin each can process 100,000 barrels a
day, according to data previously provided by the company.
