             There is a “remote risk” Germany
will abandon the euro and return to the deutschemark, Brian
Coulton, head of global economics for Fitch Ratings Ltd., said
at a conference in Singapore today.  
 The cost to the eurozone’s weaker economies of leaving the
bloc would be very high and so secession is unlikely to occur,
Coulton said.
