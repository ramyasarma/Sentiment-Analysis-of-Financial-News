             The number of  jobseekers  in France
climbed in May as manufacturers trimmed payrolls in the wake of
the country’s worst recession in more than half a century.  
 The  number of unemployed  actively looking for work rose by
22,600 last month, an increase of 0.8 percent, the Labor and
Finance Ministries said in a statement today. The total number
of jobseekers was 2.7 million, the highest since May 2005.  
 Manufacturers such as Sodimatex, a maker of car parts,  PSA
Peugeot Citroen  and Eurocopter are seeking to reduce costs and
jobs in France while President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government is
avoiding replacing retiring civil servants. While claims have
risen every month this year except in March, national statistics
office Insee predicts the economy is about to begin creating
jobs again for the first time in two years.  
 “Total employment fell heavily in 2009, dragged down by
the drop in activity,” Insee said late yesterday. “It should
progress slightly over 2010 as a whole.”  
 Peugeot Citroen said April 13 that it plans to close its
Moissy Cramayel unit that employs 398 workers as part of a
reorganization of its spare parts division.  
 Eurocopter, the helicopter unit of  European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co. , said on April 27 that it plans to cut 400
jobs in France and Germany in a bid to reduce annual costs by
200 million euros ($246 million), part of measures in “answer
to the economical crisis and the evolution of the helicopter
market.”
