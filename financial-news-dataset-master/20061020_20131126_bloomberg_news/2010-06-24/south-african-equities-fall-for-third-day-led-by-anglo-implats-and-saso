             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  dropped for a third day, sliding 204.26, or 0.7
percent, to 27,413.65 in Johannesburg.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  
 Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd.  (AIP SJ) climbed for the first
time in four days, gaining 54 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 57.85
rand. Merck & Co. said it will work with Adcock Ingram to market
and distribute medicines in South Africa as the U.S. drugmaker
seeks to increase sales in emerging markets.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest gold
producer, rose 3.94 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 335.94 rand. Gold
futures rose, rebounding from the lowest price in a week on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will keep borrowing costs
low for an extended period, weakening the dollar and boosting
the appeal of the metal.  
 Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  (IMP SJ), the world’s second-
largest platinum producer, fell 4.40 rand, or 2.3 percent, to
187.30 rand. Larger rival  Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ) retreated
for a third day, losing 16.99 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 773 rand.
The metal used in clean-emissions technology by carmakers
declined as much as 2 percent $1,538.75 an ounce.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, lost 4.99 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 282.50 rand,
bringing its drop in the last three days to 4.6 percent. Crude
oil fell for a third day, following equities, as the rising cost
to protect Greece from default spurred concern the European debt
crisis is worsening.
