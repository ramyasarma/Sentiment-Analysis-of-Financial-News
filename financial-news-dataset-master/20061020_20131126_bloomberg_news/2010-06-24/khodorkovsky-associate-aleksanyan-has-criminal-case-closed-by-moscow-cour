             A Moscow court closed a criminal
case against  Vasily Aleksanyan , a former vice-president at OAO
Yukos Oil Co., as the limitation period expired, according to
the website of Yukos’s one-time owner  Mikhail Khodorkovsky .  
 Aleksanyan, who has AIDS and cancer, was imprisoned in
April 2006 and released on bail on medical grounds in 2008.
Khodorkovsky and his former business partner  Platon Lebedev  were
jailed for tax evasion and fraud and are now on trial in Moscow
for stealing 350 million tons of oil from Yukos.  
 While doctors banned Aleksanyan from attending public
places as it would endanger his health, he was ordered to attend
the court to accept the ruling, according to his lawyer, Gevorg
Dangyan.  
 “Because of his health, he couldn’t take part in the trial
so he had to accept the court decision,” Dangyan said by phone.
“Now he can go abroad and get proper treatment.”  
 Vadim Kluvgant, a lawyer for Khodorkovsky, said it’s
impossible to predict how the latest development may affect
Khodorkovsky’s case.  
 “If anything was done in this case according to the law,
all the cases would have been resolved a long time ago,”
Kluvgant said by telephone. “Personally I am happy for
Aleksanyan, glad he got freed from this tortured yoke.”
