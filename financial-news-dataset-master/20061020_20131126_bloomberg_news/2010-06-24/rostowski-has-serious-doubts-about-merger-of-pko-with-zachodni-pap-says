             Polish Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski said he has “serious doubts” about the wisdom of
state-controlled PKO Bank Polski SA’s merging with Bank Zachodni
WBK SA, which is owned by Allied Irish Banks Plc., the PAP
newswire reported today.  
 In an interview, Rostowski told PAP that PKO’s financial
strength is “crucial” to the stability of the country’s
banking system and lending in the economy, meaning that the
government must “analyze precisely” the impact of PKO
potentially making a successful bid to acquire Zachodni.
