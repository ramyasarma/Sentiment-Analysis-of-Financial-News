             Royal Dutch Shell Plc  shut its 24-
inch  Bengal pipeline  that links three Louisiana refineries with
a combined capacity of more than 850,000 barrels a day to U.S.
South and East Coast markets.  
 “There was a small leak on the pipeline on the order of
five to 10 gallons that caused the shut-in of the pipeline”
late yesterday,  Bill Tanner , a company spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. “It’s being fixed and the line will resume
to normal operations in the near future.”  
 The Bengal pipeline, a joint venture of Shell and Colonial
Pipeline Co., connects the Louisiana refineries to Colonial’s
main pipeline system, which transports distillates and gasoline
from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast markets.  
 The  pipeline  links a 236,400-barrel-a-day refinery operated
by Motiva Enterprises LLC, a 185,000-barrel-a-day plant owned by
Valero Energy Corp., both in Norco, Louisiana, and Marathon Oil
Corp.’s 436,000-barrel-a-day Garyville refinery, to storage in
Baton Rouge. The pipeline has a capacity of 250,000 barrels a
day, according to a Colonial  filing .  
 The shutdown’s impact on Colonial’s main lines is
“negligible at this point,” Steve Baker, a spokesman for
Colonial, said in an e-mail today. Lines 1 and 2 are operating
at “healthy rates,” he said.  
 Bill Day , a spokesman for Valero, said the pipeline
shutdown has not affected the plant’s operations. Shane Pochard,
a spokesman for Marathon, declined to comment on the Garyville
refinery’s operations in an e-mail.  
 The Gulf Coast is home to more than 40 percent of U.S.
refining capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Colonial delivers on average more than 2 million barrels a day
of gasoline, home heating oil, aviation fuel and other refined
products through 5,519 miles of pipeline to 267 marketing
terminals across the U.S. South and East.
