             (Corrects sixth paragraph to show orange-juice futures fell
to the lowest price since June 10.)  
 Cotton prices rose for the third
session this week on signs of increased demand from consuming
nations including China. Orange-juice futures fell to a two-week
low.  
 Exports of upland cotton in the week ended June 17 totaled
311,253 running bales, up 20 percent from the previous week, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said today. Shipments were
“excellent,”  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in
Mandeville, Louisiana, said in an e-mail today. A running bale
weighs 500 pounds or 227 kilograms.  
 Cotton is rising “on good sales continually,” said  Rogers Varner , the president of brokerage Varner Bros. in Cleveland,
Mississippi. “The shipments were about what is necessary to
meet the target. Demand’s been good for months.”  
 Cotton for December delivery increased 0.09 cent, or 0.1
percent, to 78.25 cents a pound at 10:56 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Through yesterday, the fiber gained 3.4
percent this year.  
 Exports from the U.S., the world’s largest shipper, will
rise 10 percent from this year to 13.5 million bales in the year
that begins Aug. 1, the USDA has forecast. A bale weighs 480
pounds or 218 kilograms.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 1.8 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $1.4055 a pound in New York, after slipping
to $1.3975, the lowest price since June 10. Before today, the
commodity climbed 10 percent this year.
