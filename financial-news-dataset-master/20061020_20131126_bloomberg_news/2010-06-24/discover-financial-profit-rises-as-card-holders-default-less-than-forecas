             Discover Financial Services , the
last of the top six U.S. credit-card issuers to repay the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, posted second-quarter profit of
$258 million as write-offs declined more than forecast.  
 Net income for the three months ended May 31 was 33 cents a
share, compared with $226 million in the same period a year
earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based lender said today in a
statement. The average  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 11 cents.  
 Card issuers’ efforts to capitalize on a consumer shift
from cash and checks to plastic may be hampered by a U.S. Senate
proposal that includes limits on fees merchants pay to accept
debit cards. The legislation, part of the financial overhaul
bill pending in Congress, also would give retailers the freedom
to refuse credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts based on the form of payment.
