             AGL Energy Ltd ., Australia’s largest
electricity retailer, plans to “fast track” the A$800 million
($700 million) Macarthur wind farm after the Senate approved
revisions to laws aimed at spurring renewable energy investment.  
 The changes give the industry the certainty it needs to
spend on clean-energy projects and allow AGL Energy and its
partner, New Zealand’s Meridian Energy Ltd., to accelerate plans
for the wind farm in the state of Victoria, Sydney-based AGL
said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange today.  
 “AGL now plans to fast track the final approvals for the
development of the Macarthur wind farm, which when completed
will be one of the largest wind farms in the southern
hemisphere,” Managing Director  Michael Fraser  said.  
 The amended government plan calls for large projects such
as wind farms to deliver most of the target of generating 20
percent of the nation’s energy from renewable sources by 2020.
Smaller technologies will be treated differently.  
 AGL  was unchanged at A$14.71 in Sydney trading, while the
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  dropped 0.1 percent.  
 AGL previously said it had put more than A$1 billion of
planned wind-power investments on hold because of uncertainty
surrounding renewable energy certificates, or RECs. The value of
the certificates dropped after the government started issuing
them to consumers who install solar hot water systems.
