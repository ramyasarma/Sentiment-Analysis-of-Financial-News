             Investors should buy the Swedish
krona against the dollar and target an appreciation of about 2
percent to 7.6140 versus the U.S. currency, according to
Standard Bank Plc.  
 The bank also advised investors to buy the Swedish currency
versus the 16-nation euro, targeting an advance as strong as
9.3450,  Steve Barrow , head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange
research in London, wrote in a report today. Investors should
exit the trades should the krona weaken to 7.9320 per dollar
or 9.7380 against Europe’s common currency.  
 “Our indicators on the Swedish krona have turned more
positive recently across a whole range of currencies,” Barrow
wrote. “In order to get a general exposure to the krona, we
recommend a short position in dollar-krona and euro-krona, so
that our krona long is not affected materially by how euro-
dollar trades.”  
 The Swedish currency lost 0.2 percent to 7.7819 per dollar
as of 11:58 a.m. in London and was little changed at 9.5704
against the euro.
