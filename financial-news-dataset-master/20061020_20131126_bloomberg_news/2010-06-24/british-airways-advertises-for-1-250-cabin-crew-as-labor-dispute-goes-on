             British Airways Plc began an
advertising campaign to recruit 1,250 new cabin crew in the next
year as a 16-month dispute with its 12,000 existing flight
attendants shows no sign of nearing a resolution.  
 Europe’s third-largest airline placed a full-page ad for
cabin crew and onboard customer services managers in today’s
edition of the Daily Mail newspaper, saying it is seeking to
build a “new cabin crew team” at its London Heathrow base.  
 “We have suffered back-to-back record financial losses and
need to continue making permanent changes to our cost base to
ensure our long-term survival,” British Airways said in a
statement. “Heathrow cabin-crew costs are way out of line with
our competitors. We can no longer afford this difference.”  
 The airline said the Unite union, which represents its
flight attendants, is fully aware of the hiring plans and that
the changes won’t affect contract terms for existing staff.
