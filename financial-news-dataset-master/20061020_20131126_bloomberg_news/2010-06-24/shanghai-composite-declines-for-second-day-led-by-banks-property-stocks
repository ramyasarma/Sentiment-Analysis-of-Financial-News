             China’s stocks fell for a second
day, led by banks and developers, after the China Securities
Journal reported the country’s revenue may be insufficient to
pay the debt owned by local governments.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to
2,557.25 at 10:09 a.m. local time.
