             The dollar declined for a second day
versus the euro as traders increased bets the Federal Reserve
will keep interest rates near zero for longer in order to
support a recovery in the world’s largest economy. The dollar
fell to $1.2346 per euro as of 12:30 p.m. in Tokyo, from
$1.2311 in New York yesterday.
