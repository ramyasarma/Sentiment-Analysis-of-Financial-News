             Kenneth R. Feinberg , administrator
of the claims fund for victims of BP Plc’s oil spill, said he
also will manage a separate $100 million account to replace lost
wages for rig workers idled by the offshore drilling moratorium.  
 “They will be eligible to come to me and apply for the
$100 million,” Feinberg said today in an interview. “I’ll
evaluate those claims as well.”  
 Feinberg, former U.S. paymaster for companies that received
federal aid, was tapped last week to run the $20 billion escrow
account BP established under pressure from President Barack
Obama to cover claims from the Gulf spill. Rig workers who lost
jobs after Obama imposed a six-month moratorium on drilling
won’t be eligible to file claims against the claims fund,
Feinberg said.  
 Compensation for rig workers laid off as a result of the
moratorium that shut down drilling rigs emerged as a point of
contention before the June 16 White House meeting with Obama, BP
Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  and Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward . The worker fund is separate from the $20 billion to
cover economic damage claims from individuals and businesses on
the Gulf Coast affected by the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 Feinberg said he hoped to have the independent facility
that will evaluate claims of economic damages within the next
month.  
 “There should come a time, within the next 30 days, that
I’ve set up a permanent Gulf Coast facility ready to receive
claims for a total payment, not an emergency payment, but a
total payment in full satisfaction of your claim,” Feinberg
said.
