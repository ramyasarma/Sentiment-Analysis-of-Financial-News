             Tokyo Electric Power Co. , Asia’s
biggest utility, used fewer United Nations emissions credits
after producing 11 percent less carbon dioxide in fiscal 2009
because of increased nuclear generation and lower overall output.  
 The company redeemed 16.8 million metric tons of credits in
the year ended March 31 compared with 24.9 million tons a year
earlier, Masateru Araki, a spokesman, said by phone from Tokyo.
The utility emitted 107.5 million tons of carbon dioxide in the
same period.  
 Tokyo Electric burned less fossil fuel as the economic
slowdown sapped  sales  and as it restarted reactors, which don’t
emit carbon pollution. Japan’s power producers aim to use
credits to reduce overall greenhouse gases by 250 million tons
in the five years through 2012,  Shosuke Mori , former chairman of
the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, said last
year.  
 Tokyo Electric restarted two 1,356-megawatt reactors at the
Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant in the year ended March 31. All
seven units at the atomic station, the world’s biggest, were
shut in July 2007 because of a powerful earthquake.
