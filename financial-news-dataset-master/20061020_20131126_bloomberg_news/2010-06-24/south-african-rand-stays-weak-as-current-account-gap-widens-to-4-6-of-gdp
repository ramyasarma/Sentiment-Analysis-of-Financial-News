             South Africa’s rand maintained
losses against the dollar after a government report showed the
nation’s current account deficit widened more than analysts
expected in the first quarter.  
 The currency declined 0.4 percent to 7.5772 per dollar as
of 11:04 a.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5509.  
 The shortfall on the current account, the broadest measure
of trade in goods and services, increased to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product from revised 2.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, the Reserve Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin
released today in Pretoria. The median forecast of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP.
