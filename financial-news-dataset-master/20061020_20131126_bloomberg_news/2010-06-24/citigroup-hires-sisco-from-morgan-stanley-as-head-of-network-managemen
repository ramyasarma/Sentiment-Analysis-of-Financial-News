management for Morgan Stanley and the firm’s market-information
website, according to the statement.  
 “Gregg’s extensive professional experience and his
industry-wide reputation for delivering top-quality market
information services greatly strengthen our network information
capabilities,”  Lee Waite , global business head for Citigroup’s
direct custody and clearing, said in the statement.  
 Citigroup’s transaction services manages cash for
corporations and serves as custodian for money managers. It held

billion common shares of Citigroup to finish recovery of $45
billion in government aid the bank received in 2008.
