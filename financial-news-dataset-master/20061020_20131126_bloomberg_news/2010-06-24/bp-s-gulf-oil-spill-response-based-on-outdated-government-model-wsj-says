             BP Plc and other oil companies were 
required to base their approach to a potential spill in the 
Gulf of Mexico on U.S. government guidelines that were last 
updated in 2004, the Wall Street Journal reported.  
 The faulty government models expected oil to evaporate 
quickly or get broken up by waves or weather, the newspaper 
said. They also didn’t expect oil to reach the shoreline even 
in after much bigger spill than the current one, the Journal 
said.  
 Oil has hit 171 miles of coastline in the Gulf since the 
Deepwater Horizon accident on April 20, the Journal said.
