             Hitachi Ltd. President Hiroaki
Nakanishi said his company is in talks about changing the
ownership structure of its nuclear-power alliance with General
Electric Co., the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
interview.  
 Hitachi, which has a 40 percent stake in the venture, wants
to secure more orders outside of the U.S. and Japan, the report
said.
