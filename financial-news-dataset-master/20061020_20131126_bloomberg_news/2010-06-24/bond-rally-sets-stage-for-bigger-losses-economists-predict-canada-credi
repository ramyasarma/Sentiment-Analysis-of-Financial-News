             The rally in Canada’s 10-year
benchmark bond since the beginning of May hasn’t convinced
economists to alter their forecast that its yield will rise to 4
percent by the end of the first quarter of 2011, implying
greater losses than previously forecast.  
 The  bond’s yield , which fell to 3.234 percent yesterday --
the lowest since Nov. 30 -- will keep rising to 4.1 percent in
the second quarter of next year, according to the median of
seven estimates garnered in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. A 4
percent yield on March 31, 2011, implies a 6 percent drop in
price for a bondholder, according to a Bloomberg calculation.  
 “We’ve reduced the outlook for bond yields through most of
2010, but we think it’s basically just delaying the
inevitable,” said  Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO
Capital Markets in Toronto. “The underlying trend in rates in
2011 will be higher.”  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney , who  raised  his policy
interest rate on June 1 to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25
percent, said on June 16 future moves to increase interest rates
aren’t “preordained” because of an uneven global recovery.
 Canada’s 10-year note  yield has fallen by 19 basis points since
June 15 and 42 basis points since April 30. The 3.5 percent
security due June 2020 rose 26 cents yesterday to C$102.26.  
 ‘Flight to Safety’  
 “Clearly, 10-year yields have been dragged down in part by
the sharp drop in U.S. 10-years on a flight-to-safety bid from
equities,” said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at CIBC World
Markets in Toronto. “If equity markets can find their footing
and start creeping higher again, we expect 10-year yields to
start to move higher.”  
 Shenfeld cut his forecast for the yield in the third
quarter to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent last month, while
leaving unchanged his prediction of a 4 percent yield in the
first quarter of 2011. Shenfeld said that while he hasn’t
changed his views on how the economy will evolve, “in the near
term, our previous target looked a bit high.”  
 Elsewhere in credit markets, Ontario increased the amount
of its 3 percent bond maturing May 2013 in Norwegian currency by
250 million kroner ($38.6 million). Four provinces sold
treasuries due in September: Newfoundland and Labrador sold C$38
million ($36.6 million), Manitoba sold C$100 million, Quebec
sold C$175 million and Ontario sold C$700 million.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own the debt of
Canadian corporate rather than federal government debt held
steady yesterday at 150 basis points, or 1.50 percentage points,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield
was as narrow as 114 basis points on March 19.  
 Canada Benefits  
 “It’s really just a risk-averse move to take money out of
equity markets, but particularly to take it out of Europe and
put in the U.S.,” said  Robert Carnell , chief international
economist at ING Financial Markets in London. “Canada just
benefits from the U.S. move.”  
 ING cut its forecast for the 10-year yield to 4 percent at
the start of 2011, from the 4.4 percent it predicted last month.
Carnell said the European fiscal situation will drive yields
next year, rather than domestic factors.  
 BMO’s Porter shaved his yield forecast by 30 basis points
for the third quarter to 3.38 percent, citing lower global
growth and commodity prices, a slower pace of tightening in
monetary policy and heightened market uncertainty. He boosted
his expectations for the first three quarters of 2011 by 5
points, and said the recent drop in yields is “clearly” a
result of a flight to safety.  
 “The 10-year yield is a mix of a lot of different things:
it’s partly driven by the long-term view on  growth  and
 inflation ,” Porter said. “But it of course also reflects
current market dynamics -- it can be affected quite abruptly by
investor sentiment in the here and now, and I think that’s what
we’ve seen in recent months.”
