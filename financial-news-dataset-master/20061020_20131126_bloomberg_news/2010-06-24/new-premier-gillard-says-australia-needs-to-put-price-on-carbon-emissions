             Julia Gillard , who ousted  Kevin Rudd 
as Australian prime minister today, said she’ll restart efforts
to put a price on carbon emissions if successful in the election
she plans to call in the “coming months.”  
 “I will re-prosecute the case for a carbon price at home
and abroad,” Gillard said in Canberra today before being sworn
in. “I will do that as global economic conditions improve and
as our economy continues to strengthen.”  
 Gillard, Australia’s first female prime minister, said she
believes humans contribute to climate change and will seek a
consensus before taking action. Rudd, who stepped down as Labor
Party leader after a Gillard challenge, started losing support
in April after he shelved his emissions trading plan.  
 “It is as disappointing to me as it is to millions of
Australians that we do not have a price on carbon,” she said.
“In the future, we will need one.”  
 Gillard, 48, said she intends to lead a government
that “does more” to develop wind and solar power.  
 Rudd, who had called climate change the greatest “moral
challenge” of our time, delayed the carbon trading plan amid
opposition from lawmakers. The shelving of the carbon pollution
reduction scheme, intended to cut emissions by at least 5
percent, came almost four months after some 190 nations failed
to agree on a binding greenhouse gas treaty at talks in
Copenhagen.  
 While Gillard credited Rudd and Climate Change Minister
 Penny Wong  for their efforts to combat climate change, she said
the country continues “to face a situation where there is not
that community consensus about a carbon price.”  
 Rudd and Wong worked hard to get a “balance” on the
proposed emissions trading scheme, she said.  
 A carbon trading system is the “most effective and least
expensive way of acting on climate change, Rudd said in April.
His legislation was blocked in the Senate by the Greens party
and the Liberal-National coalition last year.

                          June 24 (Bloomberg) -- Peter Rudd, director of mining and resources at Balnave Capital, talks with Bloomberg's Judith Bogner about Julia Gillard's appointment today as Australian prime minister and its potential implications for the government's proposed tax on mining profits.
     Gillard, who was sworn in as leader after ousting Kevin Rudd, said she is willing to negotiate on the proposed tax with mining companies. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group led gains in Australian miners after Gillard made the comments. (Source: Bloomberg)
