             Trading of bearish options on U.S.
banks and brokers jumped to 2.4 times the four-week average as
U.S. lawmakers negotiated the final terms of the financial
industry regulatory overhaul.  
 Almost 440,000 puts to sell the  Financial Select Sector
SPDR  exchange-traded  fund  changed hands as of 11 a.m. in New
York, 22 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members  retreated .   
 The  most-active contracts  were August $13 puts, which rose
41 percent to 38 cents and accounted for about a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn’t closed below $13  since July .   
 Some analysts have expressed concern that changes to the
bill, including a prohibition on banks trading derivatives, have
become too onerous in recent weeks.  
 “It goes too far,”  Brian Gardner , a former congressional
staffer who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television. “It’s starting to really cross over, quite clearly,
not into the area of financial regulatory reform but into
punishment of Wall Street.”
