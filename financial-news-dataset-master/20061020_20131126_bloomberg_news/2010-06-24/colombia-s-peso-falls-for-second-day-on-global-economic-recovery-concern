             Colombia’s bonds gained, pushing
yields to their lowest level this year, after the economy grew
faster in the first quarter than analysts expected.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.89
percent at 2:37 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the lowest level since Dec. 2, 2009. The
bond’s price rose 0.422 centavo to 121.093 centavos per peso.  
 Colombia’s economy expanded 4.4 percent in the first
quarter from the year-earlier period led by growth in
construction and mining, the national statistics agency  said  in
Bogota today. That’s above the 3.6 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 24 economists.  
 “That was the push bonds needed to regain their trend”
for lower yields, said Carlos Ramos, an analyst at Interbolsa
SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage. He forecasts the yield will
fall to 7.8 percent by next week.  
 Yields on the 2020 bond have dropped 1.27 percentage points
in the last four months after annual inflation slowed in March
to 1.84 percent, its lowest level since 1955, and the central
bank unexpectedly cut  interest rates  in April to 3 percent.
Annual inflation was 2.07 percent last month.  
 The peso closed little changed at 1,896.30 from 1,895.68
yesterday.
