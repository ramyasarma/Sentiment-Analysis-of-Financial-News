             India’s benchmark stock index fell,
erasing earlier gains, as investors withdrew funds from riskier
assets amid renewed concerns about the strength of global
economic growth.  
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. , a software-services
provider that gets about a fifth of its sales in Europe, lost
the most in two weeks. Reports on U.S. housing and European
manufacturing fanned speculation economies may expand at a
slower pace. ICICI Bank Ltd., India’s second-largest bank,
dropped 1.6 percent.  
 “There are worries about the global economy and global
markets,” said  Vaibhav Sanghavi , who manages funds for wealthy
individuals as director at Ambit Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. “At
the same time, India is doing very well, so one has to have a
balanced view between here and the rest of the world.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
declined 25.70, or 0.1 percent, to 17,730.24. The gauge earlier
gained as much as 0.5 percent. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange fell 0.05 percent to 5,320.60. The  BSE
200 Index  dropped 0.1 percent to 2,243.60. The expiry of index
futures today may have made the gauges more volatile, Sanghavi
said.  
 Tata Consultancy lost 1.6 percent to 773.45 rupees. DLF
Ltd., India’s biggest real estate developer, retreated 0.9
percent to 289.2 rupees. ICICI Bank slid 1.6 percent to 885.7
rupees.  
 Growth Risks  
 The Federal Reserve yesterday said that “financial
conditions have become less supportive of growth.” Sales of new
homes in the U.S. declined in May to a record low as a tax
credit expired and the Fed signaled Europe’s debt may harm
American growth.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  10.4 billion rupees  ($225.3
million) of Indian equities June 22, taking their total
purchases of the stocks this year to 290.5 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 HCL Technologies Ltd.  (HCLT IN), a software services
company, dropped 2.3 percent to 364.15 rupees. About 2.4 percent
of its equity changed hands in a single block deal on the Bombay
Stock Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buyers
and sellers weren’t immediately known.  
 Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.  (KMB IN) fell 3.6 percent to 756.1
rupees. ING Groep NV sold its entire holding of 10.7 million
shares in the lender for 8.03 billion rupees, or 750 rupees
apiece, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Shriram EPC Ltd.  (SEPC IN) gained 1.2 percent to 266.05
rupees after the engineering company said it won contracts
valued at 830 million rupees.
