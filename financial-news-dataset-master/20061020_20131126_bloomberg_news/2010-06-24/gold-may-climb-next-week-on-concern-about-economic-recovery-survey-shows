             Gold may gain as investors buy the
metal to protect their wealth on concern the global economic
recovery will falter, a survey found.  
 Ten of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said bullion would rise next week.
Four forecast lower prices and five were neutral. Gold for
delivery in August was down 1.1 percent for this week at $1,244
an ounce at 10:45 a.m. in New York yesterday. It reached a
record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 Gold is up 13 percent this year as investors seek to
protect their wealth against the crisis in Greece and other
European nations struggling to repay debt. Credit-default swaps
on Greece rose to an all-time high of 970 basis points
yesterday, according to CMA DataVision, increasing the cost of
protection against default. Purchases of U.S. new homes fell in
May to the lowest level on record, a June 23 report showed.  
 “Investment demand has not shown any signs of easing,
driven by anxiety over troubles in the euro zone and
persistently weak macro data,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London.  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling that most respondents expect a
decline. The green line shows the gold price. The data shown are
as of June 18.  
 The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 182 of 316 weeks, or 58 percent of
the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 10  Bearish : 4  Neutral : 5
