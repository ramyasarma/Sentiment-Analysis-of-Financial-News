             Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he “hopes” to see agreements on fiscal targets
at a Group of 20 meeting this weekend in Toronto, saying the
U.K. budget may provide guidance.  
 “Yes, there are some more discussions about what the
precise targets would be and that’s not a settled matter,”
Flaherty told reporters today in Toronto. “There are the
targets that were set out in the new budget of the U.K.”  
 U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  this week
introduced a budget with fiscal tightening measures amounting to
about 40 billion pounds ($59.9 billion) a year, which by 2015
would nearly erase a deficit that reached 11 percent of gross
domestic product in the last fiscal year.  
 The “key” to this weekend’s G-20 discussions will be to
balance fiscal consolidation and the need to sustain growth,
Flaherty also said. Germany and the U.S. have been at odds on
whether to prioritize debt reduction or growth stimulus, with
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  this week saying Europe’s debt levels
have to be reduced because they are one of the main causes of
the crisis.  
 Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper , in a letter to his
G-20 counterparts, said he wants leaders to agree to a target of
reducing deficits by half by 2013, and to stabilize or begin
reducing their ratios of debt-to-output by 2016.  
 He also said most G-20 countries oppose the idea of a tax
on banks and that China is moving to boost domestic demand.
