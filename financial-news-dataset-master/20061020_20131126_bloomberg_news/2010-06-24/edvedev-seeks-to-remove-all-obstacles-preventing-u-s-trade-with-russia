             Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
said he is encouraged by interest from U.S. companies to invest
in Russian enterprises and hopes they will “actively partake”
in an effort to establish a high-tech center outside Moscow.  
 “We’re interested in removing all the obstacles” blocking
trade with Russia, Medvedev said through a translator at a joint
press conference with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White
House.  
 Before arriving in Washington, Medvedev toured Silicon
Valley companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. in San Jose,
California, and Apple Inc. in Cupertino, as part of his efforts
to create a technology hub.  
 Obama and Medvedev will meet with other leaders of Group of
20 nations at a summit in Canada this weekend. The leaders of
the world’s largest economies will focus on balancing the need
for government spending to encourage growth against growing
budget deficits.
