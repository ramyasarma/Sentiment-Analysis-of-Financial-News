             Russia’s  central bank  may keep rates
unchanged this week after inflation stabilized, while bank
lending and the economy continued to recover,  VTB Capital  said.  
 Bank Rossii, which has signaled it may hold a rate meeting
tomorrow, has cut the  refinancing rate  14 times since April 2009
to a record low of 7.75 percent. The bank will probably maintain
the rate at that level through the end of the year,  Aleksandra Evtifyeva  and  Dmitri Fedotkin , Moscow-based economists at VTB
Capital, said by e-mail today.  
 Consumer-price growth  in June may slow to 5.8 percent,
compared with 6 percent a month earlier, according to VTB
Capital. Annual inflation may ease to as low as 5 percent in the
summer before accelerating in the fall to as much as 6.5 percent,
Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said on June 19.
