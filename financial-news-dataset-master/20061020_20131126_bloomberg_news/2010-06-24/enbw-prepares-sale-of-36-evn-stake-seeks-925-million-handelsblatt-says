             EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG
is preparing the sale of its 36 percent stake in EVN AG of
Austria and eight banks are competing for the mandate,
Handelsblatt said, citing unidentified bankers.  
 The German energy company aims to generate 750 million
euros ($925 million) by selling the shares to institutional
investors on the stock market, the newspaper said. The placement
is planned for some time after the summer break, according to
Handelsblatt.
