             German Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle said recent “positive” economic data suggest that
now is the right time to let the government’s economic stimulus
measures expire as planned.  
 Ending stimulus measures helps achieve needed budget
consolidation, Bruederle said in the editorial of the ministry’s
monthly report, the Economy Ministry said in a faxed statement.
