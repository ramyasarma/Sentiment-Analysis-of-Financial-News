             Jefferies Group Inc. , a New York-
based securities firm that specializes in mid-size companies,
hired  Roland Sand  of  Credit Suisse Group AG  as the head of its
German investment bank.  
 Sand, who will be based in London and Frankfurt, will join
Jefferies on Oct. 1, spokesmen at the two companies said today.
Sand was Credit Suisse’s co-head of coverage in Germany and a
managing director specializing in technology and media companies
such as Infineon Technologies AG and Unitymedia GmbH.  
 Jefferies, which reported record  investment-banking  revenue
this week, has increased its headcount by more than 25 percent
since 2008, taking advantage of the collapse of larger
investment banks.  
 Sand joined Credit Suisse in 2005 from JPMorgan Chase &
Co., where he advised clients such as Deutsche Telekom AG and
ProSiebenSat1 Media AG. Before JPMorgan, he was Deutsche Bank
AG’s media and telecommunications banker in Asia.
