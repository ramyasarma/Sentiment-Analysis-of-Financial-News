             Brazil’s Finance Ministry may offer
tax cuts for energy efficient refrigerators and washing machines
to compensate for a drop in sales in May, o  Estado de Sao Paulo 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  
 The government is studying ways to reclassify appliances
for energy efficiency and may cut the tax on industrialized
goods by half for the most environment-friendly refrigerators,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported today.  
 Patricia Mesquita , a spokeswoman at the finance ministry,
declined to comment.
