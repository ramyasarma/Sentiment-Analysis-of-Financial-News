             Italy’s  jobless rate  rose in the
first three months to the highest since the third quarter of
2003 as the recovery in Europe’s fourth-biggest  economy  failed
to create jobs.  
 The unemployment rate climbed to a seasonally adjusted 8.4
percent from a revised 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter, Rome-
based statistics institute  Istat  said today. Economists had
predicted a rate of 8.6 percent, according to the median of 11
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Istat had originally
reported an 8.2 percent rate for the last three months of 2009.  
 Italy’s economy expanded 0.4 percent in the first quarter
as the falling euro boosted  exports , while domestic demand
remained weak.  Consumer confidence  fell in June to the lowest in
16 months as households grew pessimistic about the jobs outlook,
the Rome-based research center  Isae  said yesterday.  
 Joblessness may climb further as the recovery prompts
unemployed workers who had given up looking for work to seek
jobs, Labor Minister  Maurizio Sacconi  said. “This would mean
that the rate of ‘inactivity’ will decline,” he said yesterday.  
 The unemployment rate rose to a revised 8.7 percent in
April, Istat said today. The institute on June 1 had initially
projected a rate of 8.9 percent.
