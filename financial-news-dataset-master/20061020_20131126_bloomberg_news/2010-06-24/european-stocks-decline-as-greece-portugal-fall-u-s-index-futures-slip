             European stocks declined, led by
shares in Greece, Spain and Portugal, as concern increased that
the region’s debt crisis may derail the economic recovery.  
 The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slid 0.7 percent to
252.71 at 9:03 a.m. in London. The gauge has fallen 7.1 percent
from this year’s high on April 15. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
was little changed and futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped 0.5 percent.  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday as the Federal Reserve signaled
that European indebtedness may harm American growth. In a
statement hours after a government report showed new-home sales
in May plunged 33 percent, the Fed said “underlying inflation
has trended lower” and repeated a pledge to keep the benchmark
interest rate near zero for “for an extended period.”  
 Greece’s ASE Index led declines among 18 European benchmark
indexes, sliding 1.3 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 fell 1.1 percent
and Portugal’s PSI-20 dropped 0.9 percent.
