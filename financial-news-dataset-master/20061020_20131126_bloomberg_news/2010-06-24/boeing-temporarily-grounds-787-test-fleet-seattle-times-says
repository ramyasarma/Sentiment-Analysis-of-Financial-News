             Boeing Co. temporarily grounded its 
Dreamliner 787 test fleet because of a problem in the 
horizontal tails that are built by Alenia, the Seattle Times 
reported, citing Boeing.  
 Engineers are checking all 23 jets already built, the 
Times said. A fix to the problem may take as long as eight 
days, it said.
