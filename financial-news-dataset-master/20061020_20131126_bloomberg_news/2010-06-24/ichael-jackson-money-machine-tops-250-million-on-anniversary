             The wall-to-wall TV coverage today
will show candlelight vigils and weeping admirers. Meanwhile,
off stage, some really happy folks are counting the winnings.  
 The King of Pop, we’ve just learned, is worth more dead
than alive, with his estate earning more than $250 million over
the year.  Billboard  totes up $1 billion in revenue.  
 While the theme is  Michael Jackson’s  prodigious posthumous
earning power, on the anniversary of his death everyone wants to
know: Who gets the money? The kids? The creditors? Bubbles?  
 Jackson’s children -- Prince, Paris and the unfortunately
nicknamed Blanket -- live with their grandmother Katherine
Jackson at the family’s residence in California. She has
described the trio as “normal -- or as normal as can be under
pretty extraordinary circumstances.”  
 The creditors are sitting prettier. Just about a year ago
Jackson was set to embark on concerts to stave them off.  
 Now the income may clear some debts and sort out the
Byzantine imbroglio over Jackson’s former home Neverland. Some
may shudder at the thought of the 2,600-acre Santa Barbara ranch
becoming a creepy theme park with kiddie rides or a Graceland-
style memorial.  Elvis Presley  fans may be aghast at the prospect
of the true monarch being mentioned in the same sentence as
Jackson.  
 In the  Forbes  October 2009 list of Dead Celebrities,
designer  Yves Saint Laurent  was top with $350 million, followed
by composers Rodgers & Hammerstein ($235 million), Jackson ($90
million) and Presley on $55 million. Elvis has been boosted by
the Elvis 75 events, though Jackson looks set to be catapulted
up to his saddest No. 1 record.  
 Chimp Reunion  
 As for Michael’s pet,  Bubbles , he’s in a Florida sanctuary.
He recently was visited by Michael’s sister La Toya for what was
billed as “an emotional reunion after 20 years.” A smiling La
Toya said the chimp looked much the same, though with a few gray
hairs. Bubbles showed no sign of emotion as he stared into the
TV camera like a pro.  
 The machine continues to whir. So far, we have had a
concert film, “This Is It,” and we can expect everything
Jackson has done to be reissued in deluxe editions. There are
hundreds of unreleased tracks in the Sony Corp. vaults.  
 Those wanting to discover the real Jackson should play
“Thriller.” For those with more money than sense, look for
tacky souvenirs such as gold-plated Jacko shades. For those
seeking 15 minutes of fame or wanting to pay their last
respects, the place to go is  Forest Lawn Cemetery  in Glendale,
California. Be advised that you can leave flowers though you
won’t be allowed too close to Jackson’s tomb and must behave
respectfully. It’s as if he’s still alive, really.  
 Murder Claim  
 No, I’m not going down the road of blogger speculation,
crazy Twitters and conspiracy theories. If you believe them,
he’s living in Dubai, Dundee or Delhi. Right on cue, La Toya, in
an interview with GMTV, claimed that her brother Michael was
murdered because he was “worth so much more dead than alive.”  
 In the wacko world without Jacko, it seems we can believe
anything about him as long as it’s incredible.
