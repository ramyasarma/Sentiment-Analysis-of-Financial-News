             Russian stocks slid to their lowest
level in a week as oil retreated and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
downgraded gold producers. The ruble weakened for a third day.  
 OAO Rosneft , the country’s biggest oil company, and OAO
Gazprom, its natural gas export monopoly, fell more than 1.5
percent.  OAO Polymetal  tumbled 3.9 after Goldman recommended
selling the shares. The 30-stock Micex Index dropped 1.1 percent
to 1,363.15 at the close in Moscow, its lowest level since June
17.  
 The gauge tracked declines in European stocks, as concern
increased that the region’s debt crisis may slow the economic
recovery. U.S. stocks fell yesterday as the Federal Reserve
signaled that European indebtedness may harm American growth.
Gold has “reduced upside potential,” Goldman analyst  Vasily Nikolaev  wrote in a report dated today.  
 “Russia is closely following the oil price and European
debt concerns,”  Tom Mundy , strategist at Renaissance Capital,
said by phone today.  
 The ruble weakened for a third day against the dollar,
declining 0.2 percent to 31.0975 at the close, its lowest level
in more than a week. Russia’s currency slipped 0.3 percent to
38.2300 versus the euro. The government’s benchmark sovereign
dollar bonds due April 2020 were little changed, with the yield
falling 1 basis point to 5.44 percent.  
 Crude oil, the country’s chief export earner, retreated as
much as 1.1 percent to $75.55 a barrel. Russian stocks, the
world’s best performers last year as an economic recovery
boosted the earnings outlook of oil and metals producers, have
retreated 11 percent from their April 15 peak on concern
economic growth may slow.
