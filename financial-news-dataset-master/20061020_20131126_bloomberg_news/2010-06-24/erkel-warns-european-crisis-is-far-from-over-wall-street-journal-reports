             German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
Europe’s financial crisis was far from over and rejected U.S. 
calls for her country to focus on domestic spending, the Wall 
Street Journal reported, citing an interview.  
 Merkel said eurozone nations had merely bought some time 
in their efforts to fix problems in the common currency, adding
that the rescue fund agreed in the wake of the Greek financial 
crisis had calmed the situation; she rejected suggestions that 
Germany had caused problems by delayed the Greek rescue, saying
it was important that clear conditions be imposed, the 
newspaper said.  
 The German leader rejected calls made by President Barack 
Obama in a letter to G20 leaders urging exporting countries 
such as China, Japan and Germany to focus more on domestic 
markets, saying Germany’s export success reflected the strength
of its manufacturers, the Journal reported.
