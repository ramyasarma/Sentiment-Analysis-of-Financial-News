             The U.K.’s coalition government
asked  Richard Hooper , a former communications regulator, to
review his 2008 report that recommended selling a stake in Royal
Mail Group Plc to fund modernization of the postal operator.  
 The U.K.’s 360-year-old service is struggling to compete
with TNT NV of the Netherlands, Deutsche Post AG’s DHL Worldwide
Express unit and  Business Post Group Plc  as European Union rules
phase in competition for deliveries between 2011 and 2013.  
 Hooper’s report recommended the government take
responsibility for Royal Mail’s pension deficit, then 7 billion
pounds ($10.5 billion), and sell a stake. TNT was mentioned as a
possible bidder at the time.  
 “We believe that Richard Hooper’s recommendations and
analysis are still broadly valid today, but as our policy
develops we want to be able to test it against current market
conditions,” Business Secretary  Vince Cable  said in an e-mailed
statement today. “Richard’s in-depth knowledge and experience
will enable us to take account of recent developments in the
postal market.”
