             There is no “serious risk” of a
country exiting the single European currency because leaving
would cause more pain than staying, said  Moritz Kraemer , head of
sovereign ratings for Europe at Standard & Poor’s.  
 There would also be “contagion effects” for neighboring
European countries, Kraemer said at “The Sovereign Debt
Briefing” in London hosted by Bloomberg Link.  
 The euro has tumbled about 19 percent against the dollar
since Nov. 25, 2009 as investor concern that countries including
Greece may default spurred speculation the 16-nation currency
union may break up. The European Union crafted a 750 billion
euro ($908 billion) rescue package in May in a bid to stem the
crisis.  
 Greece’s economy will contract 3.9 percent this year after
shrinking 2 percent in 2009, according to the median of eight
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The euro-region will
expand by 1.1 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2011, after
falling 4.1 percent last year, median forecasts show.  
 Hans-Werner Sinn , president of Germany’s Ifo economic
institute, said on June 3 that it would be best for Greece to
leave the euro instead of implementing an austerity program to
reduce its deficit. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
pledged budget cuts worth almost 14 percent of gross domestic
product to bring the deficit within the EU limit of 3 percent by
the end of 2014.  
 “The real solution for Greece would be to leave the euro
followed by a depreciation” of the new currency, Sinn said in
an interview at a conference in Interlaken, Switzerland.  
 European Central Bank Executive Board member  Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  said on May 28 that there are “no alternatives” for
Greece beyond following the austerity program.  
 Greek 10-year government bonds yielded 782 basis points
more than benchmark German bunds at 9:49 a.m. in London, the
most since May 7, before the rescue package was announced.
