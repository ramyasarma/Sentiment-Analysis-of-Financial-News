             Isramco Negev 2 LP  and  Delek Energy
Systems Ltd. , two Israeli oil and gas explorers, were initiated
at  Deutsche Bank AG  with a “buy” recommendation as the bank said
the country may be able to export fuel to Europe.  
 Houston-based  Noble Energy Inc.  and local partners in the
Leviathan prospect on June 3 said the area may hold 16 trillion
cubic feet of gas and has a 50 percent chance of “geologic
success.” The Tamar field, which is expected to start producing
the fuel by the end of 2012, may hold 8.4 trillion cubic feet.  
 “With the discovery of Tamar and with gas imported under
contract from Egypt, Israel should have enough natural gas to
meet domestic demand for circa 35 years,” Tel Aviv-based
analysts  Richard Gussow  and  Dan Harverd  wrote in a note today.
“Export potential exists in the Leviathan prospect, while
additional potential remains in other parts of the basin.”  
 Deutsche Bank rated  Avner Oil Exploration LP  and  Delek
Drilling LP. , both Noble partners, “hold” in new coverage and
raised  Delek Group Ltd.  to “buy” from “hold.”  
 Delek Drilling and Avner are controlled by Delek Energy,
which is held by billionaire  Isaac Tshuva ’s Delek Group.  
 Delek Group, which has surged 76 percent over the past 12
months, dropped 0.6 percent to 860 shekels at the close in Tel
Aviv. Isramco rose 1.5 percent, Delek Energy increased 2
percent, Avner fell 1.4 percent and Delek Drilling slipped 2.8
percent today.
