             Copper climbed in London, leading
gains in base metals, as the dollar fell on speculation the
Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero for longer
in order to support a recovery in the world’s largest economy.  
 Three-month delivery copper rose as much as 2.6 percent to
$6,684 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at
$6,645 at 2:56 p.m. in Shanghai. Zinc increased as much as 1.7
percent to $1,860 a ton and tin advanced as much as 1.8 percent
to $18,150 a ton.  
 The U.S. currency weakened versus 11 of its 16 most-active
counterparts after Fed officials said in their statement that
falling prices for energy and other commodities were
undercutting inflation. Metals, priced in the dollar, usually
move counter to the currency.  
 “The dollar seems to be holding its losses, which is
bullish for metal prices in the short term,” Zhang Sida, an
analyst at Dalu Futures Co. said from Shanghai today. “In the
medium term, we don’t see any solid signs of demand
improvement.”  
 Copper, used in wires and pipes, is still almost 20
percent off an April peak on concerns that the global economic
recovery may slow, hurting demand.  
 Purchases of U.S.  new homes  fell in May to the lowest
level on record after a tax credit expired, figures from the
Commerce Department showed yesterday in Washington. Sales of
existing houses, which make up about 90 percent of the U.S.
market, slid in the same month while economists had predicted a
gain. The U.S. is the world’s second largest copper consumer
and construction accounts for a quarter of demand.  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai added as much as
1.5 percent to 53,900 yuan ($7,911) a ton and closed at 53,520
yuan. Shanghai zinc jumped as much as 2.7 percent to 15,460
yuan and aluminum rose as much as 1.1 percent to 14,975 yuan.  
 “Strong buying on the Shanghai Futures Exchange by small
investors” lifted zinc prices, analysts led by  Mark Pervan  at
ANZ Banking Group Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.
“Apparently the per-ton price is less than a third of copper,
making the barriers to entry lower.”  
 Aluminum added 0.4 percent to $1,948 a ton in London, lead
was 0.5 percent higher at $1,823 a ton and nickel increased 0.9
percent to $19,450 a ton.
