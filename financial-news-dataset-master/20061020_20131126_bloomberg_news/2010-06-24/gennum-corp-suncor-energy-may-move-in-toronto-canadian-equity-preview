             Canadian stocks  fell, led by
financial shares, as the cost to insure Greek government bonds
against default rose to a record, indicating investors believe a
default on sovereign debt is more likely.  
 Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-largest bank, dropped 2.3
percent. Suncor Energy Inc., the country’s biggest oil and gas
company, lost 2.2 percent as oil futures retreated for a third
day. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
increased 0.2 percent on an upgrade from Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 137.32
points, or 1.2 percent, to 11,670.18.  
 “The market seems to be concerned that contagion from
European issues will be longer than expected,” said  Barry Schwartz , who helps manage C$340 million ($326 million) as a
money manager at Baskin Financial Services Inc. in Toronto.
“It’s a jittery market, and investors are still traumatized
from 2008” when the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market
triggered a 49 percent plunge in the S&P/TSX in about five
months.  
 The S&P/TSX has fallen 0.6 percent this year, after surging
31 percent last year, as concern over the European debt crisis
has weighed on commodity prices. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Commodity Price Index has slumped 7.7 percent this year.  
 Credit-default swaps on Greece rose 38 basis points to a
record 970 basis points today, according to CMA DataVision.
Insurance against defaults on Portuguese and Spanish sovereign
debt also became more costly.  
 Slump  
 Industrial orders  in countries that use the euro currency
increased 0.9 percent in April, the European Union’s statistics
agency said today. Economists had forecast an advance of 1.6
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The  S&P/TSX Banks Index  dropped for a third day. Bank of
Montreal declined 2.3 percent to C$60.32. Royal Bank of Canada,
the country’s largest bank, lost 1.2 percent to C$53.10.
Toronto-Dominion-Bank, Canada’s No. 2 bank by assets, slipped
1.5 percent to C$71.58.  
 Oil futures gained 18 cents to $76.53 at the close of U.S.
floor trading in New York after the U.S. Energy Department
reported yesterday that stockpiles were greater than most
analysts forecast and the International Energy Agency said world
oil demand will slow in the next five years. Natural gas futures
fell to a two-week low as forecasts showed cooler weather in the
U.S. next week, reducing demand for gas-powered electricity for
air conditioning.  
 Energy Producers  
 Suncor  decreased 2.2 percent to C$33.30. Imperial Oil Ltd.,
Canada’s second-largest energy company, dropped 1.7 percent to
C$40.43. Cenovus Energy Inc., the oil company spun off from
EnCana Corp. in December, fell 2.8 percent to C$28.34.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer, declined 2.5 percent to C$99.19. Cuts in
farm subsidies are likely as the U.S. seeks to trim its budget
deficit,  Collin Peterson , chairman of the Agriculture Committee
in the U.S. House of Representatives, said at a hearing today.  
 Gold producer Barrick climbed after Credit Suisse  Anita Soni  raised its ratings to “outperform” from “neutral.”
Barrick should benefit from a rising gold price in the second
half of the year, Soni said in a note to clients. Barrick rose
0.2 percent to C$46.55.  
 Colossus Minerals Inc., which is developing a gold and
platinum-group project in Brazil, soared 9.5 percent to C$7.96
after announcing a new discovery.
