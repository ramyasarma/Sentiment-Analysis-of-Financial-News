             Senate negotiators working on the
financial-regulatory bill today rejected a proposal from House
Republicans that would make big banks liable for the costs of
winding down  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .  
 The proposal would have made the government-controlled home
loan companies, which own or guarantee more than half of the $11
trillion U.S. mortgage market, part of a Wall Street-financed
“rainy day” fund that would be used to pay for the liquidation
of large failed companies.  
 Senate Banking Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd , a
Connecticut Democrat who has led the Senate side of final
negotiations on the bill, called the Fannie-Freddie proposal a
“stall tactic.”  
 In a letter to lawmakers today, American Bankers
Association Chief Executive Officer  Edward Yingling  said
the provision “could impose a tremendous additional liability
on the banking industry of hundreds of billions of dollars.”  
 House and Senate lawmakers are in the last stages of talks
on the shape of the bill that would overhaul Wall Street rules.
Under the legislation, if the assets of a failing financial
company weren’t enough to finance its liquidation, other large
firms would be tapped to cover costs. House Republicans wanted
to define Fannie and Freddie as “financial companies” under
the proposal.  
 Until being seized by the government in September 2008,
Washington-based  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  of McLean, Virginia,
operated as private companies investing in the mortgage market
with an implicit government guarantee against default.  
 The government-sponsored enterprises were taken over by the
U.S. Treasury Department when they were overwhelmed by losses
linked to risky mortgages. Since then, they have been surviving
on a promise of unlimited government aid, drawing $145 billion
so far.
