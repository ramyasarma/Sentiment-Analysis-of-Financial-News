Jean-Claude Trichet said governments need to implement
“credible measures” to consolidate their finances.  
 “The delicacy of the current situation requires credible
measures, this is very important. It is necessary in order to
correct divergent paths,” Trichet said in an interview with
Italy’s La Repubblica which was posted on the bank’s website.
“Sustainable fiscal policies will help to consolidate the
recovery,” Trichet added.  
 Current austerity measures won’t trigger economic
stagnation and inflation expectations are “remarkably well
anchored,” Trichet said. Asked whether the euro is at risk,
Trichet said it is “a very credible currency.”
