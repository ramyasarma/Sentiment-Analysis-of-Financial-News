             The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds rose, reversing an earlier decline,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 8.5
basis points to 556, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at
9:30 a.m. in London. The debt insurance contracts had declined
to 542 in earlier trading.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 2 basis points to 128,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also rose, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index tied
to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers up 2.5 at 166.5 and
the subordinated index 3 higher at 252.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality
