             Weinstein Co., the film studio run
by brothers  Bob  and  Harvey Weinstein , reached an agreement with
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to eliminate its $450 million in debt,
a person with knowledge of the terms said.  
 Goldman was paid $115 million and took ownership of 250
films with $225 million in receivables and future cash flow that
should retire Weinstein’s debt, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the accord isn’t public.  Weinstein  will
be paid to manage the movies and can buy them back before 2016.  
 The agreement frees New York-based Weinstein of $30 million
a year in interest payments, the person said. The closely held
studio retains 150 titles including “The Reader” and
“Inglourious Basterds.” Goldman and partner Assured Guaranty
Ltd. got titles including “Halloween II” and “The Road,” The
Wall Street Journal reported earlier today.  
 “Obviously this is an exciting time for the company,”
Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. “It’s always nice when a
deal can be a win-win for all partners involved.”  
 Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm in U.S.
history, fell 9 cents to $134.98 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have declined 20 percent
this year.  
 “We believe that the restructuring will allow the
Weinstein Company to continue to produce new films, and to
create value for all of its stakeholders,” Goldman said in an
e-mailed statement. “All of the parties to the transaction have
worked to arrive at this resolution.”
