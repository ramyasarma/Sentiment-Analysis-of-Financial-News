             The Philippine peso may weaken 3.1
percent against the yen over the next 10 days or so after the
Southeast Asian nation’s currency yesterday dropped through its
200-day moving average, according to Okasan Securities Co.  
 The breach was a bearish signal and the peso may fall to
1.892 yen based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers, said
 Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan in Tokyo. It
was 0.4 percent lower at 1.952 as of 12:38 p.m. in Manila, after
losing 2.3 percent in the last two days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 200-day moving average was 1.971.  
 “The peso broke through an important technical point,”
Tokyo-based Soma said. “It seems to be on a declining trend
from here.”  
 The Philippine currency reached 2.137 yen on April 26, the
strongest level since October 2008, before sliding to this
year’s low of 1.892 a month later. The peso’s gain stalled three
times near a 50 percent reversal of that decline at 2.015 this
month, suggesting the peso will fall back to this year’s low,
Soma said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other significant levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 50
percent, 61.8 percent and 76.4 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
