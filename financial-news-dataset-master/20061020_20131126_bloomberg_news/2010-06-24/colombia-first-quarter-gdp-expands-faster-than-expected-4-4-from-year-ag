             Colombia’s economy grew 4.4 percent
in the first quarter of the year as the global credit crunch
eased and local demand picked up.  
 Economists expected a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase,
according to the median of 22 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The agency has adjusted its data using the base year of
2005, instead of a base year of 2000.
