             Ghana’s  Statistical Service  said it
will announce its revised economic growth figures for 2006 to
2009 in July, four months later than originally planned.  
 The new gross domestic product numbers will include the
first  quarterly  growth rate to be reported by the statistics
agency, for the first three months of 2010, Ebo Duncan, head of
economic statistics at the service, said yesterday.  
 “The type and scale of economic activity has changed over
the years and obsolete things must be removed and new things
added,” Duncan said in an interview in the capital, Accra.  
 Standard Bank said in a report on Jan. 28 that the
statistics agency may have underestimated economic growth for
years. The revision would give a greater weighting to more
dynamic sectors of the economy, said  Stephen Bailey-Smith , an
analyst at Standard Bank. Duncan confirmed that Ghana’s GDP
would be revised up, though he declined to say how much.  
 While reducing the relative size of the budget deficit,
increased GDP would also cut the impact of oil production, which
will begin later this year and was expected to push economic
growth to 22 percent in 2011, Bailey-Smith said in January.  
 Annual GDP was provisionally estimated at $21 billion last
year by the statistics agency, while the International Monetary
Fund has estimated it at $35 billion. The economy expanded 4.7
percent last year, 7.3 percent in 2008, 6.3 percent in 2007 and
5.9 percent in 2006, according to the statistics agency’s
previous estimates.
