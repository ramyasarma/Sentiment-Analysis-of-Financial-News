             Rubber climbed for a second day to
one-week high on optimism that Japan and China will soon build
up stockpiles amid concerns that rainfall in southern Thailand
will further cut scarce supplies from the largest exporter.  
 Futures in Tokyo advanced as much as 3 percent to 286.2 yen
per kilogram ($3,185 a metric ton), the highest level since June
16, headed for a second weekly gain on optimism that the
European debt crisis may not substantially weaken demand for the
commodity used to make tires and gloves.  
 “Tokyo doesn’t have many stocks in the warehouse, neither
does Shanghai,” said Kazunori Kokubo, a manager at Yutaka Shoji
Ltd. Speculation that the two countries will soon accumulate
rubber is helping to drive gains, he said.  
 Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell
12.1 percent to 3,563 metric tons on June 10, according to data
released today from the Rubber Trade Association of Japan.  
 China’s natural rubber  inventories  fell 1,440 tons to
16,441 tons, based on a survey of 10 warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures
Exchange said June 18. It’s the lowest level since 2003,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Rubber for November-delivery gained 1.1 percent to settle
at 280.9 yen per kilogram on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The
November-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose
1.3 percent to settle at 21,820 yuan ($3,202) a ton.  
 China, the world’s largest auto market, is the biggest user
of natural rubber. The nation may increase gross imports of the
raw material to 1.68 million tons this year, from 1.59 million
in 2009, according to a May report from the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries.  
 Thai Supplies  
 The monsoon covering the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of
Thailand is causing heavy rains in many parts of the country,
including southern provinces, the  Meteorological Department  said
on its website today. Thailand’s southern provinces account for
68 percent of the nation’s total rubber plantation area.  
 “Heavy rains sparked worries that the currently low level
of supplies will subside further,” Varut Rungkhum, analyst at
commodity broker Agro Wealth Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok.  
 “The nearby contract rally reflected a tight supply in the
physical market. Its gains spilled over to other contracts,”
Varut said.  
 The contract for June delivery, which expired today, gained
as much as 2.5 percent to 372.90 yen per kilogram before
settling at 372 yen.  
 The benchmark price in Thailand advanced 0.9 percent to
117.35 baht ($3.62) a kilo as demand remains strong and rainfall
limits tapping, reducing latex production, the  Rubber Institute
of Thailand  said on its website today.  
 Global rubber output may total 9.7 million to 10.2 million
tons this year as drought and heavy rainfall in key producing
countries including Thailand and Indonesia damage supply,
Stephen Evans, the secretary-general of the International Rubber
Study Group, said in an interview last week. That compares with
the group’s forecast range of 10.1 million to 10.6 million tons
on March 17.  
 Demand will probably increase by 4.4 percent this year to
9.8 million tons, based on the assumption that the economic
recovery will slow, Evans said. The group forecast in March that
demand would be 10.2 million tons.
