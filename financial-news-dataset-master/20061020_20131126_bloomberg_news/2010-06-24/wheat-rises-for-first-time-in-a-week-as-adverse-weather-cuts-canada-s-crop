             Wheat futures rose for the first
time in a week on speculation that adverse weather will curb
production in Canada, the world’s second-biggest exporter.  
 Rain prevented as much as 12.5 million acres of grain from
being planted in Canada. The harvest of U.S. winter wheat was
slowed by precipitation, and drought in Russia may curb output.
Wheat has increased 4.3 percent this month.  
 “The whole Canadian weather situation has propped up wheat
a little,” said  Jon Marcus , the president of Lakefront Futures
and Options LLC in Chicago. “The market had come down quite a
bit, and that was a small spark of bullish news. I don’t think
the Canadian situation was the end of the world, but it was
enough to boost prices after the market sold off.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 1.75 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $4.775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price has dropped 12 percent this year amid increasing
global inventories. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter,
and Russia is third.  
 Crops in Saskatchewan, the biggest Canadian producer of
grain, were 76 percent seeded as of June 21, up from 73 percent
a week earlier, the provincial Ministry of Agriculture said in a
report today.  
 “Crops are showing signs of stress from excess moisture,”
the ministry said. “Crop damage is attributed mostly to
flooding and hail. Cutworm, wireworm and gopher damage has been
reported, along with leaf diseases and root rots.”  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
