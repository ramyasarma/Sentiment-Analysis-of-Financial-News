             French consumer spending rose in May
as signs that the job market is stabilizing boost household
confidence.  
 Spending on manufactured goods rose 0.7 percent from April
when it fell a revised 1.3 percent, national statistics office
Insee said today. Economists expected a gain of 0.4 percent, the
median of 16 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg showed. Spending
climbed 1.9 percent from a year earlier.  
 France’s unemployment rate stopped rising in the first
quarter as the nation’s recovery from a recession took hold.
Improving job prospects are key to reviving consumer confidence
and spending.  
 “The job losses are slowing and that is contributing to
confidence,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas
in Paris. “It may be a while before we see significant hiring,
though signs of a turning point do help.”  
 The jobless rate was unchanged in the three months through
March from a revised 9.9 percent in the fourth quarter, Insee
said on June 3. While jobless claims were at a four-year high of
2.68 million in April, claims have dropped in two of the past
five monthly reports. The government reports jobless statistics
for May later today.
