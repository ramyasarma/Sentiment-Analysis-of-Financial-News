             DSG International Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest consumer-electronics retailer, plans to restore the
Dixons name, which it dropped in 2005 after 68 years.  
 From September, DSG will be known as Dixons Retail Plc, the
Hemel Hempstead, England-based company said today. The change
will “harness the powers of the Dixons brand that resonates
strongly with stakeholders, particularly suppliers,” Chief
Executive Officer  John Browett  said on a conference call.  
 DSG began as a Dixons photography studio in Southend,
England in 1937 and built up a chain of 320 electronics stores,
which it scaled back in 2004 and renamed Currys.digital in 2006.
Since then, the Dixons name has been used for online retailing
and nothing will change for customers, Browett said.  
 “The reality is the stakeholders all refer to us as
Dixons, so to make it a bit easier and simpler, we’ve gone back
to that name,” he said. “It’s a corporate simplification.”  
 DSG today reported its first  annual profit  in three years
after upgrading more than 200 stores across the group since
2008. About two-thirds of the retailer’s U.K. stores will have
been transformed by October, and profitability at remodeled
outlets in the U.K. is up about 20 percent, DSG said today.  
 The company plans to reduce its number of stores in the
U.K. to about 500 from 654 “over time” as it combines more
Currys and PC World outlets under a single roof. The so-called
megastores are proving popular with customers and delivering
profit increases of about 50 percent, DSG said.  
 ‘Challenging Conditions’  
 DSG fell 0.36 penny, or 1.3 percent, to 27.14 pence at 11
a.m. in London trading. The  stock  has dropped 25 percent this
year, after almost tripling in 2009.  
 The retailer, which has  businesses  in Italy, Greece, Spain,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey and Scandinavia, said it
expects “challenging” conditions to continue in many of its
markets, where consumer spending “is likely to come under
pressure from fiscal tightening.”  
 Earnings from the U.K. and Ireland, the source of almost
half DSG’s revenue, rose to 71.1 million pounds ($106.6 million)
in the year ended May 1 from 58.7 million pounds a year earlier.
Profit in the Nordic countries, where DSG owns the Elkjop chain,
climbed to 97.4 million pounds from 76.1 million pounds.  
 Net income was 59.8 million pounds compared with a loss of
219.4 million pounds in the previous year.
