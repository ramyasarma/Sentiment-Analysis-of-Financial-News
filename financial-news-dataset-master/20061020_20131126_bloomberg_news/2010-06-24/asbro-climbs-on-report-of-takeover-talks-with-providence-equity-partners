             Hasbro Inc.  climbed as much as 12
percent in early trading after the Wall Street Journal reported
that the toymaker is in discussions with Providence Equity
Partners Inc. about a possible takeover.  
 Talks held over the past few weeks are in early stages and
may not lead to a  purchase , the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the matter. Hasbro, owner of the Nerf toy brand,
has a market value of about $6 billion, which would make it the
largest leveraged buyout of the year, the Journal said.  
 Before today, Hasbro’s shares had climbed 28 percent this
year, more than twice the pace of larger rival  Mattel Inc. 
Hasbro, which also owns the Monopoly brand, posted an almost
threefold increase in net income last quarter after selling more
games and puzzles.  
 If the talks were to succeed, Hasbro would join other U.S.
toymakers in seeking additional investment.  Toys “R” Us Inc. 
said last month that it plans to raise as much as $800 million
in an initial public offering after KKR & Co., Bain Capital
Partners LLC and Vornado Realty Trust took the company private
in 2005 for $7.5 billion.  
 Hasbro climbed as high as $46 in early trading after
closing at $41.12 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 Providence, which recently sold Bresnan Communications Co.
to  Cablevision Systems Corp.  for $1.37 billion, may need at
least 40 percent equity contribution to buy a company the size
of Hasbro, the Journal, said compared with recent contributions
of about 30 percent. Talks are proceeding slowly due to
uncertainty about current markets, the newspaper reported.  
 Wayne Charness , a spokesman for Pawtucket, Rhode Island-
based Hasbro, wasn’t immediately available to comment.
