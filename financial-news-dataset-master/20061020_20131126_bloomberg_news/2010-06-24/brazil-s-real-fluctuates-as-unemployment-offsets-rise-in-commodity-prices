             Brazil’s real fluctuated between
gains and losses as a report showing unemployment unexpectedly
rose in May offset a rise in global commodity prices.  
 The real climbed 0.4 percent to 1.7803 per dollar at 2:09
p.m. New York time, from 1.7873 yesterday. The rise extended the
currency’s advance in June to 2.3 percent.  
 Unemployment rose to 7.5 percent in May, the national
statistics office said today in Rio de Janeiro. The figure was
higher than the median estimate of 7.1 percent in a survey of 31
economists by Bloomberg. Unemployment was 7.3 percent in April.
The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index of 26 raw
materials climbed as much as 0.7 percent.  
 “There’s been consistently stronger data until now, but
unemployment surprised on the downside and that might be keeping
investors cautious,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a currency
strategist with RBS Securities Inc. In Stamford, Connecticut.
“But, in general, this is still a pretty low unemployment rate
for Brazil.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.29 percent.
