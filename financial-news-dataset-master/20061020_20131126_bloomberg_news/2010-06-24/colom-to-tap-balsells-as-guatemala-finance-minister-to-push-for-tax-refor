             Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom
will name Edgar Balsells as finance minister after  Alberto Fuentes  resigned from the post upon failing to gain support for
new tax rules, said Fernando Barillas, a Colom adviser.  
 Balsells is the country’s representative at the  Central
American Bank of Economic Integration . Fuentes quit yesterday
after he couldn’t generate backing among business leaders and
lawmakers for fiscal changes sought by Colom, Barillas said.  
 “Whether Balsells will be able to push through new reforms
largely depends on the political will of congress,” Barillas, a
special adviser to the president, said in a telephone interview.  
 Colom is seeking to reduce tax evasion and other changes to
fiscal policy to control a budget deficit that may grow on
damages from last month’s Tropical Storm Agatha, according to a
 statement  yesterday on the presidential website. Agatha may have
caused as much as $1 billion in damages, Colom told reporters
June 14.  
 Fuentes said in a  statement  yesterday that he hopes his
successor will have “more success” than he in getting tax
reforms through congress.  
 Colom named Erick Coyoy, the former deputy finance
minister, as economy minister, the statement said. Fuentes will
go to Mexico to work as a technical adviser for the  Economic
Commission for Latin America , according to the statement.
