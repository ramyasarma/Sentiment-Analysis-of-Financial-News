             U.K. banks remain “vulnerable” to
further writedowns on their assets because of a potential
decline in investor appetite for risk, the  Bank of England  said.  
 Derivatives and other financial instruments accounted for
40 percent of U.K. banks’ total assets at the end of 2009, the
central bank said in its semiannual financial stability report
published in London today. Globally, mark-to-market losses on
assets rose to $7.8 trillion in June from $4.5 trillion in
March, it said.  
 “If sovereign risk concerns rise or risk appetite
continues to diminish, asset prices could fall further,” the
BOE said. “This would have a significant impact on the solvency
positions of holders of these assets, including both U.K. and
global banks.”  
 Policy makers are seeking to strengthen their banking
systems after lenders globally posted $1.78 trillion of
writedowns since the start of the financial crisis. Banks may
need to raise as much as $375 billion to increase capital and
liquidity under Basel III rules, which may be introduced by the
end of 2012, according to an estimate by  UBS AG  analysts.  
 While  U.K. banks  are still vulnerable to a drop in asset
prices, they have mitigated that risk by reducing their holdings
of credit market instruments by 21 percent to 207 billion pounds
($310 billion) last year, the BOE said. Writedowns on such
instruments at the four biggest U.K. banks fell to 9 billion
pounds in 2009, compared with losses of 20 billion pounds in the
previous year.  
 New Capital Needed  
 The Bank of England said the sovereign debt crisis in
Europe had increased the risk of instability in the U.K.
financial system, and banks need to raise more capital to guard
against shocks.  
 “The speed with which Greece’s problems were transmitted to
other countries and markets highlighted persistent fault lines
in the global financial system,” the bank said in the report.
“U.K. banks face a number of challenges and need to maintain
resilience in a difficult environment.”  
 British banks’ direct holdings in Greece and other
peripheral European economies that are facing funding pressures
are modest relative to their counterparts in the rest of the
region, the BOE said.  
 U.K.  banks  are “particularly exposed” to the French and
German banking systems, which account for about a quarter of
their claims on banks globally, the central bank said.  
 EU Meeting  
 “U.K. banks face increased counterparty credit risk on
exposures to other European banks,” the report said.  
 European Union officials are meeting in Brussels today to
discuss whether Spanish savings banks and Germany’s regional
state-owned Landesbanken should be included in the current round
of stress tests, according to two people with knowledge of the
situation. The Spanish government is already stress-testing 45
savings banks, known as cajas.  
 In the U.S., congressional lawmakers approved a ban on
proprietary trading by banks and new oversight of the
derivatives market in an overhaul of financial regulation. The
bill is designed to protect consumers, reduce risks, increase
surveillance and give regulators emergency powers following the
biggest financial crisis since the 1930s.
