             Chinese police broke up a “terror”
group of more than 10 people that included at least two men from
the westernmost province of Xinjiang, the Ministry of Public
Security said at a briefing in Beijing today.  
 The group carried out “many” terrorist attacks starting
in 2008, including one incident in the western Xinjiang city of
Kashgar at the start of that year’s Olympic Games, Ministry of
Public Security Spokesman Wu Heping told reporters in Beijing.
On Aug. 4, 2008, 16 border patrol policemen were killed when two
men drove a truck into them, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported at the time.  
 Wu said the group was associated with and received
financial assistance from the East Turkistan Islamic Movement,
which is pushing for the independence of Xinjiang. The report
comes before the one-year anniversary of the July 5 riots in
Urumqi. Almost 200 people died last year and more than 1,000
were injured when clashes broke out between Uighurs and the
majority Han ethnic group.  
 Years of central government policies encouraging migration
of Han Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China’s
population, to areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang have stoked
ethnic tensions. Last October, a leading al-Qaeda theologian
called for a holy war against China.  
 “China will lawfully strongly attack each terrorist
activity and safeguard social stability,” Wu said.
