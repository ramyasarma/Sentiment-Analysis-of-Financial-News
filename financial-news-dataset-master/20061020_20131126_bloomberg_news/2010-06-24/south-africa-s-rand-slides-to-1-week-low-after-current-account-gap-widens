             The rand slid to the weakest level
in more than a week versus the dollar after South Africa’s
current-account deficit rose more than expected in the first
quarter, raising the need for foreign capital to fund the gap.  
 The currency declined for a third day, losing as much as
1.7 percent to 7.6752 per dollar, the weakest intraday level
since June 15, before trading 1 percent down at 7.6295 by 4:52
p.m. in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.5509 yesterday. The rand
also had its biggest slide in more than a month against the
euro, depreciating as much as 1.9 percent to 9.4303.  
 The shortfall on the  current account , the broadest measure
of trade in goods and services, widened to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product from a revised 2.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, the Reserve Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin
released today in Pretoria. The  median forecast  of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP.  
 “The deficit was bigger than expected and it’s going to
continue to widen because our import intensity has increased due
to the economic recovery,” said  Carmen Nel , an economist at
Rand Merchant Bank in Cape Town. “That could potentially be a
risk to the currency in the medium to long term, even though
risk appetite remains a dominant factor in the short term.”  
 South Africa’s current-account gap expanded from the lowest
since at least 2004, reached in the final quarter of last year,
as an economic expansion of 4.6 percent in the first three
months of 2010 spurred demand for imports. Imports also
increased as the rand gained 1.6 percent against the dollar in
the first quarter, adding to the currency’s 28 percent rally
last year.  
 Bonds  
 Government in April last year described the deficit as the
“Achilles heel” of South Africa’s economy because it leaves
the country reliant on foreign purchases of stocks and bonds to
fund the shortfall. Foreign investors have purchased a net 58.4
billion rand ($7.7 billion) of South African assets this year,
according to the  JSE Ltd. , which runs the country’s exchanges.  
 Government bonds in South Africa fell the most in almost
three weeks after a report showed the cost of goods leaving
South African factories and mines rose at a faster pace in May
than the previous month. The benchmark 13.5 percent security
dropped 28 cents to 123.05 rand, increasing the yield by 6 basis
points to 7.99 percent.  
 Producer-price inflation  accelerated to an annual 6.8
percent from 5.5 percent in April, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The median estimate of
20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.2 percent.
