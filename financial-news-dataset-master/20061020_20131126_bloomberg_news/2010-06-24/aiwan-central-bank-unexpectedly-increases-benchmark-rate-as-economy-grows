             Taiwan’s central bank unexpectedly
raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008
after the economy expanded by the most in more than 30 years.  
 Governor Perng Fai-nan and his board increased the discount
rate on 10-day loans to banks to 1.375 percent from a record-low
1.25 percent, confounding the forecasts of all 13 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, who expected no change. Gross
domestic product rose 13.3 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since 1978.
