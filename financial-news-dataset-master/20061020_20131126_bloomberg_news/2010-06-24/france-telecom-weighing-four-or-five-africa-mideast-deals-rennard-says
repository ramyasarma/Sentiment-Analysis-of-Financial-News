             France Telecom SA  is studying four
or five acquisitions in Africa and the Middle East, and may
complete some deals this summer.  
 The company is identifying targets close to its existing
assets,  Marc Rennard , executive director for Africa, the Middle
East, and Asia, said in an interview in Paris. The company isn’t
averse to initially buying minority stakes, he said.  
 “Perhaps we will sign in the summer, perhaps it will take
six months,” Rennard said. “We do not want to deteriorate our
Ebitda ratio, but we need growth,” he added, referring to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  
 France Telecom Chief Executive Officer  Stephane Richard 
said in April that the company may spend as much as 7 billion
euros ($8.6 billion) on African and Middle East deals over the
next five years, as part of a strategy to double revenue from
emerging markets. The plan comes as revenue growth slows in its
core European markets.  
 France Telecom last month began operations in Tunisia with
a 49 percent stake in its local unit. It pledged  to invest about
500 million euros  in operations and a third-generation wireless
network. The company “will probably get the opportunity to
increase our participation in a couple of years” in the unit,
Rennard said.  
 The French company is not alone in looking to Africa to
boost revenue. This month,  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  completed its $9
billion purchase of African assets of Kuwait’s Zain, giving the
Indian company operations in 18 countries on the continent.  
 Vivendi SA , whose SFR unit is the second-largest French
mobile operator, has pushed its telecommunications business
southward from Morocco with acquisitions in Mali, Mauritania,
Burkina Faso, and Gabon.  
 New Revenue  
 Emerging markets last year accounted for about 3.3 billion
euros of sales at France Telecom, or about 7 percent of total
revenue of 46 billion euros. The company currently has African
operations in countries including Senegal, Cameroon, and Niger.  
 While France Telecom considers acquisition targets,
“organic growth remains at the heart” of its plans to expand
its African business, Rennard said.  
 In  April Richard  said that about a billion euros in new
sales would come from existing operations over the next five
years.
