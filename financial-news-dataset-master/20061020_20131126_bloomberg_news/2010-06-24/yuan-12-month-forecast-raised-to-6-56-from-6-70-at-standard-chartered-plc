             Standard Chartered Plc raised its
one-year forecast for the yuan to 6.56 per dollar from
6.70, citing an earlier-than-expected decision by China’s
central bank to allow its currency to trade more freely.  
 Appreciation will accelerate in the fourth quarter as
the People’s Bank of China seeks to demonstrate more
flexibility, according to a research note published today. The
yuan will also be supported by a rise in the trade surplus in
the second half of the year as a recovery in exports gains
momentum, it added.  
 The U.K. lender also raised its end-September forecast for
Malaysia’s ringgit to 3.26 per dollar, from 3.30. End-September
estimates for the Philippine peso and Thai baht were cut to
46.50 and 32.50, respectively, from 45.50 and 32.00.
