             Lawmakers resolved a sticking point
in financial-regulation talks by giving the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission power to make stock brokers more accountable
to investors only after the agency studies the issue.  
 A House-Senate panel working to merge two versions of the
rules overhaul into a single bill agreed to let the SEC impose a
fiduciary duty on brokers once the regulator completes a six-
month review. House lawmakers had earlier proposed implementing
stiffer rules without a study period, prompting opposition from
senators led by  Tim Johnson , a South Dakota Democrat.  
 Consumer advocates have said the fiduciary obligation is
needed because investors can be misled into buying products they
don’t understand and are often confused by the titles used by
financial advisers. Wall Street banks and insurance companies
have lobbied against the change, saying individuals selling
securities shouldn’t be regulated the same way as professionals
who invest money for clients.  
 A fiduciary duty would require brokers who offer clients
investment advice to disclose all conflicts of interest and sell
stocks and bonds that are in customers’ best interests. Brokers
now only have to ensure a product is suitable before marketing
it to a customer.  
 House lawmakers also approved an amendment offered by
Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, to bar the SEC from
regulating equity-indexed annuities. The decision means state
insurance regulators will continue overseeing the products,
typically sold to retirees, that link returns to equity markets.  
 Companies selling the annuities say they are more like
insurance than securities because investors get a minimum
guaranteed return. The SEC tried to regulate them in 2008,
saying its oversight would help ensure that firms disclose to
investors all fees and penalties for canceling contracts early.
