             Argentina won’t resolve about $6.7
billion outstanding debt with the Paris Club group of creditor
nations if it is required to have an oversight program with the
International Monetary Fund, Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said.  
 “Argentina doesn’t have any debt with the IMF and will not
have any program with the IMF,” Boudou said in a  video
interview posted  on the website of newspaper Ambito Financiero.
“If this is an obstacle, we won’t be able to resolve the Paris
Club problem.”  
 Ambito posted the video a day after Boudou announced the
results of Argentina’s offer to restructure debt it defaulted on
in 2001 and which wasn’t tendered in a 2005 swap.  
 Creditors holding about $12.1 billion, or 66 percent, of the
country’s $18.3 billion of eligible defaulted debt tendered
their securities in the restructuring, which ended June 22,
Boudou said yesterday.  
 Argentine borrowing costs will remain high after the debt
swap, in part due to the unresolved Paris Club loans, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. economist  Alberto Ramos  wrote in a report from
New York yesterday. The Paris Club debt is owed to governments
and is separate from the debt covered by the restructuring.  
 The yield on Argentina’s benchmark dollar bonds due in 2015
climbed 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 13 percent
at 4:19 p.m. New York time.
