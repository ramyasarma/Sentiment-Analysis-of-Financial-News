             Mexican President  Felipe Calderon 
announced measures to stimulate purchases of new cars after
vehicle  production  and  sales  fell during last year’s recession.  
 The federal government will begin paying a state tax on car
ownership, normally paid by automobile owners, for new vehicles
costing as much as 250,000 pesos ($19,700), Calderon told
reporters. The government will also gradually eliminate the tax,
known as a “ tenencia ,” by the end of 2011, Calderon said.  
 Mexican development bank Nacional Financiera SNC will also
auction guarantees by year-end for about 2.5 billion pesos in
loans that commercial banks will give for auto purchases,
Calderon said. The guarantees aim to boost the number of car
loans given out by 12 percent in the second half of the year
from the same period in 2009, he said.  
 “This measure aims to ensure the recovery of new-auto
sales in the country,” Calderon said today in Mexico City.
“It’s been one of the sectors most affected by the global
economic crisis last year.”  
 Mexican production of cars and light trucks fell 51 percent
in January 2009 from a year earlier as demand for exports
plummeted amid the global financial crisis. Output has recovered
this year, increasing 65 percent to 178,738 units in May from
the same month a year earlier, the nation’s Automobile Industry
Association said June 14.  
 Ignacio Deschamps , head of Mexico’s Banking Association,
said yesterday that Mexico’s credit markets are recovering and
loans will reach double-digit growth by the end of 2010.  
 The peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.6809 per dollar at 1:33
p.m. New York time from 12.6451 yesterday.
