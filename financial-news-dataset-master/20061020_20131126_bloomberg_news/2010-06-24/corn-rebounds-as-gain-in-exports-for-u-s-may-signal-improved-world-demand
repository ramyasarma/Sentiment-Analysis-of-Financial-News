             Corn rose for the first time this
week on speculation that a third straight week of increased
exports from the U.S., the world’s largest shipper, may signal
improved demand for the grain.  
 Net sales jumped to 1.46 million metric tons in the week
ended June 17, up 19 percent from a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a  report . The total
included 1.12 million tons for delivery in the year that ends
Aug. 31. Before today, corn prices plunged 12 percent this year.  
 “If prices come down, which they have, you see some
demand,” said  Jon Marcus , the president of Lakefront Futures
and Options LLC in Chicago. “Corn is still attractive
underneath those old highs, so we have some countries scrambling
to get in while prices are decent, and that props up export
demand.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.6675 a bushel at 11:50 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price slipped as much as 1.1 percent.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
