             Hong Kong stocks  fell, dragging down
the Hang Seng Index the most in more than two weeks, as a slump
in U.S. home sales to a record low fueled concern the country’s
economic recovery may falter.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc , a bank that got 20 percent of revenue
from North America last year, slid 1.5 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. ,
China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, fell 1.9 percent as crude
oil declined. Bank of Communications Co. lost 1.9 percent after
Fitch Ratings Ltd. warned of asset-quality deterioration.  
 “There are still difficulties,” said  Tim Leung , who helps
manage about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“There’s not a lot of strong data that supports a continuous
strong momentum in economic growth in the U.S.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.6 percent to 20,733.49 at the
close after climbing as much as 0.2 percent, with three stocks
declining for every two that advanced. The decline was its
biggest since June 7. The gauge has fallen 5.2 percent this year
as worries about budget deficits in Europe and credit tightening
by China dented confidence in the strength of the global economy.  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of the so-called H-
shares of Chinese companies slipped 0.7 percent to 11,935.95.  
 The declines cut the price of stocks in the Hang Seng Index
to  13.7 times  estimated earnings on average, down from 18 times
on Nov. 16, the highest level in 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  
 HSBC Holdings dropped 1.5 percent to HK$75.25, the biggest
drag on the gauge, followed by Cnooc.  
 Oil Shares Fall  
 The U.S. Commerce Department yesterday said purchases of
new homes plunged 33 percent to an annual pace of 300,000 in May
from April, less than the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data going back to 1963.  
 Cnooc  fell 1.9 percent to HK$13.52.  PetroChina Co. , the
country’s largest oil producer, retreated 1.1 percent to HK$9.  
 Crude oil futures slid 1.9 percent to $76.35 yesterday,
extending their drop in the last two days to 2.9 percent. The
contract dropped 0.4 percent in after-hours electronic trading
in New York today.  
 Bank of Communications declined 1.9 percent to HK$8.58.
China Citic Bank Corp., a unit of the nation’s largest
investment company, fell 1 percent to HK$5.21. Bank of China
Ltd., the nation’s third-biggest lender, lost 0.5 percent to
HK$4.08.  
 Accelerating loan growth in China has “considerably raised
credit risk exposure” at the nation’s banks, according to Fitch.
The pace of new lending means future asset quality deterioration
is a “near-term certainty,” said  Charlene Chu , Fitch’s senior
director of financial institutions for China.  
 Property Shares  
 Property developers rose on speculation low borrowing costs
will fuel demand for real estate. U.S. Federal Reserve officials
yesterday retained a pledge to keep the benchmark interest rate
at a record low for an “extended period.”  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s fifth-biggest
developer by market value, climbed 0.8 percent to HK$30.90. Sino
Land Co., also a developer, gained 0.7 percent to HK$14.40.  
 Hong Kong typically tracks interest-rate movements in the
U.S. because the city’s currency is pegged to the dollar. Lower
borrowing costs help sustain demand for property, according to
Danny Yan, a portfolio manager at Taifook Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees $400 million.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 1 percent.
