                  June 24 (Bloomberg) -- Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , which paid
$3 billion for Australia’s Felix Resources Ltd. last year,
jumped in Hong Kong trading as the new Australian prime minister
said she will negotiate over a tax on resources profits.  
 Yanzhou, China’s fourth-biggest coal producer, climbed 2.3
percent to HK$17.58 as of the 12:30 p.m. local trading break.
 Julia Gillard  made the comments after ousting former leader
 Kevin Rudd , whose proposed 40 percent tax had sparked a public
clash with mining groups.  
 “A deal is probably now more likely, which would result in
a less onerous tax regime on the mining sector than the one
originally proposed,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head
of investment-markets research at Colonial First State Global
Asset Management, which manages about $135 billion.  
 Citic Pacific Ltd., a Chinese steelmaker that owns an iron
ore project in Australia, advanced 2.8 percent to HK$15.60 after
Gillard said she was opening the door to talks with miners and
pledged to end a government ad campaign in support of the tax.
