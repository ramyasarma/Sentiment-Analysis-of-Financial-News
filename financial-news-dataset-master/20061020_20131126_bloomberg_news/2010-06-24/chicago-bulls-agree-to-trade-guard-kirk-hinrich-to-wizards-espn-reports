             The Chicago Bulls agreed to trade
guard  Kirk Hinrich  to the Washington Wizards, a move that would
open up room under the National Basketball Association’s salary
cap that the team could use to sign free agents,  ESPN reported ,
citing people it didn’t name.  
 The move will removed Hinrich’s $9 million-a-year  contract
from Chicago’s books, putting the Bulls under the cap by more
than $30 million and allowing them to add two maximum-contract
players. The top free agents probably will include
 LeBron James ,  Dwyane Wade , and  Chris Bosh .  
 The trade cannot become completed until July 8. ESPN
reported that the Sacramento Kings also might be willing to
trade for Hinrich, who is averaging 13.4 points and 5.8 assists
during his six-season career,
