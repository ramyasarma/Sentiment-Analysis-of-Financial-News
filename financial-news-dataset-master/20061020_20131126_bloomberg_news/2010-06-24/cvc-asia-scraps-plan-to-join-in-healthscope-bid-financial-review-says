             CVC Asia Pacific scrapped plans to
team with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a takeover offer for
Healthscope Ltd., the Australian Financial Review reported in
its Street Talk column, without saying where it got the
information. KKR is still doing due diligence for its bid which
may compete with a rival group including Blackstone Group LP,
TPG Capital and Carlyle Group, the newspaper said.
