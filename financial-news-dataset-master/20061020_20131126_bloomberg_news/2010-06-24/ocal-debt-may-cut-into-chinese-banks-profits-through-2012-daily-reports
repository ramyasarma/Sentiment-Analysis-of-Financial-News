             Chinese local government debt may
depress banking industry profitability by 7.9 percent between
this year and 2012, the China Daily reported, citing a report
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  
 Banks may have to set aside 283.1 billion yuan ($42
billion) in provisions for bad loans over the next two years as
the ratio of doubtful debt to local financing arms rises to 3.36
percent and watchlist loans reach 13.46 percent, according to
CASS’s 2010 Blue Book for China Finance.
