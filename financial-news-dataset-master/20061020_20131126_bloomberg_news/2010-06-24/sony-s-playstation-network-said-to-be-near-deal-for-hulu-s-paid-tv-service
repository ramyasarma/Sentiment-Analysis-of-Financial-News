             Sony Corp.  is close to an agreement
to carry a paid TV service from  Hulu LLC , operator of the
second-largest video website, on its PlayStation 3 game console,
two people with knowledge of the talks said.  
 The partnership could be announced as soon as next week,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified because
the arrangement hasn’t been made public.  
 Access to video-game consoles would give Hulu’s planned pay
service a bigger audience and more revenue by making its
Internet programming more widely available on television sets.
Hulu also is in talks with  CBS Corp. ,  Viacom Inc.  and  Time
Warner Inc.  to add their TV shows to the website’s subscription
service, people with direct knowledge of the discussions said.  
 PlayStation 3 owners registered for the console’s free Web
service, the  PlayStation Network , would be able to subscribe to
a Hulu service that provides on-demand access to current and
past seasons of prime-time TV shows from NBC, Fox and ABC, the
people said. Hulu also is in talks to put its $9.95 a month
service on  Microsoft Corp. ’s Xbox, Reuters reported previously.  
 Patrick Seybold , a spokesman for Sony’s PlayStation Network
in Foster City, California, declined to comment on a possible
agreement, as did  Christina Lee , a spokeswoman for closely held
Hulu. Worldwide, the PlayStation Network has 50 million
registered users, Seybold said in an e-mail.  
 Sony fell 1.2 percent to 2,462 yen as of 10:52 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  shares  of the world’s third-largest TV
maker have declined 7.8 percent this year.  
 Founders, Investors  
 Hulu, based in Los Angeles, was founded by  General Electric
Co. ’s NBC Universal and  News Corp. ’s  Fox. Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC
and private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners Inc. are also
investors in the website.  
 The site, which now lets computer users watch shows for
free and gets its revenue from advertising, is seeking to expand
the ways users can view programming, as well as add new shows to
attract paying subscribers. The company will need to renew
program rights from owners including NBC at the end of 2011,
according to  Laura Martin , a Needham & Co. analyst. The network
investors also offer shows on their own websites.  
 A subscription would put Hulu in more direct competition
with  Netflix Inc. , which supplies online and mail-order access
to movies and past-season TV shows starting at $8.99 a month.
Netflix already provides its online movie service on consoles
from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co., as well as through Blu-
Ray players and Roku Inc. devices that connect TVs to the Web.  
 Hulu Chief Executive Officer  Jason Kilar  has said his
site’s ad-supported model is profitable on a cash-flow basis.  
 The website garnered $52.4 million in sales in February,
with 72 percent going to the content owners, according to
estimates from research firm SNL Kagan. That left Hulu with
$14.7 million in revenue, $12.6 million in costs and a $2.04
million profit, SNL Kagan calculates.
