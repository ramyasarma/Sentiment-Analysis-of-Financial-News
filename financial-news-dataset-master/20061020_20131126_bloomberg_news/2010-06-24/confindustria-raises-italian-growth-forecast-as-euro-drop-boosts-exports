             Italy’s biggest employers’ body,
Confindustria, raised the country’s economic growth forecast for
this year and next as the weaker euro boosts exports.  
 Italian gross domestic product will expand 1.2 percent this
year and 1.6 percent in 2010, up from previous forecasts of 1.1
percent and 1.3 percent respectively, Confindustria said today
in an e-mailed report.  
 The single currency’s 14 percent slide against the dollar
this year will “more than offset” the impact of budget cuts
worth 24.9 billion euros ($30.6 billion), which will shave 0.4
percentage points of GDP in 2011 and 2012, Confindustria said.  
 Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won praise last month from
executives for plans to cut ministry budgets and handouts to
regional governments, and freeze wages for state employees. He
told Confindustria at its annual assembly in May that the
deficit-curbing measures were necessary to “defend the euro.”  
 His package aims to reduce the budget deficit by an
additional 1.6 percent of GDP, bringing the shortfall within the
EU limit of 3 percent of GDP in 2012 from 5.3 percent last year.  
 Italians will still struggle to find work after Europe’s
fourth-biggest economy emerged from recession last year.  
 Confindustria today estimated that 528,000 jobs were lost
in 2008 and 2009. Italy’s unemployment rate rose in the first
three months to a seasonally adjusted 8.4 percent, the highest
since the third quarter of 2003, national statistics institute
Istat said today.
