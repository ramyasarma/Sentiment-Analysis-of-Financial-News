             Macquarie Group Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest investment bank, fell the most in more than four months
in Sydney trading after saying increasingly uncertain markets
are weighing on some parts of its business.  
 The stock dropped 4.7 percent to A$40.65 at the local
close, the biggest decline  since  Feb. 9. The benchmark  S&P/ASX
200 index  fell 0.1 percent.  
 It’s “too early to evaluate implications” for earnings in
the year ending March 2011, the bank said in a presentation to
be given today by Chief Financial Officer  Greg Ward , which was
filed to the stock exchange. Macquarie said market conditions
make short-term forecasting “difficult.”  
 The update compares with an outlook Macquarie provided on
April 30, when it forecast better performances from all its
businesses this financial year. Since then, Europe’s debt crisis
has spawned a $1 trillion bailout package, while in U.S. Federal
Reserve officials said yesterday financial conditions have
become less supportive of economic growth.
