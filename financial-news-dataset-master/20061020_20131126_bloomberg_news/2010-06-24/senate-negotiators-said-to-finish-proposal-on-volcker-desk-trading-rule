             Senate negotiators have completed
work on proposed Volcker rule language to restrict proprietary
trading by U.S. banks, according to a person with knowledge of
the talks.  
 The Senate proposal hasn’t been released, according to the
person, who declined to be identified because the plan isn’t
public.
