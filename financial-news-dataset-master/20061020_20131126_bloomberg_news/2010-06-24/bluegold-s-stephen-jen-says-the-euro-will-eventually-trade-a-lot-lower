             The euro will eventually trade a lot
lower against the dollar as the differences between the region’s
economies puts the project under pressure, said Stephen Jen,
managing director of macroeconomics and currencies at BlueGold
Capital Management LLP.  
 The dollar zone, including Asian countries such as China,
that peg their currencies to the dollar, is breaking up because
of different speeds of economic growth, Jen said at “The
Sovereign Debt Briefing” in London hosted by Bloomberg Link.
