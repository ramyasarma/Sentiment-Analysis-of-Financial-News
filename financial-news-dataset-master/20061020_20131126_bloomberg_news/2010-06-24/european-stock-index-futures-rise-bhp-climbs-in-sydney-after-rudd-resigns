             European stocks  retreated for a
third day, led by declines in Greece, Spain and Portugal, amid
renewed concern that the sovereign-debt crisis may derail the
economic recovery.  
 EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA  led a 3.7 percent drop in Greece’s
benchmark ASE Index as credit-default swaps on Greek debt rose
to a record. Rio Tinto Group paced a decline in basic-resources
shares as optimism faded that major changes may be made to
Australia’s proposed mining tax. Adidas AG fell 4 percent after
rival Nike Inc. reported sales that trailed analysts’ forecasts.  
 The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slid 1.8 percent to
249.78 as gauges in Greece, Spain and Portugal fell at least 2.3
percent. The Stoxx 600 has declined 8.2 percent from this year’s
high on April 15 even after the European Union last month
unveiled a 750 billion-euro ($921 billion) loan package aimed at
stopping the euro region’s weakest members from defaulting.  
 “We are concerned about Europe,” said  Jane Coffey , who
helps manage $51 billion at Royal London Asset Management.
“They have addressed the problems but the key is in the
execution. Markets are still hostage to various sentiment swings
concerning macro data.”  
 The Federal Reserve yesterday left the interbank lending
rate target unchanged in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where
it’s been since December 2008, after signaling that European
indebtedness may harm U.S. growth.  
 Greece, Spain  
 National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets. Greece’s ASE tumbled 3.7 percent, Spain’s  IBEX
35  slid 3 percent and Portugal’s PSI-20 lost 2.3 percent.  
 Eurobank, Greece’s second-largest bank, dropped 5.2 percent
to 3.82 euros as credit-default swaps on Greek government debt
rose 145 basis points to a record 1,077 according to CMA
DataVision.  Banco Santander SA , Spain’s biggest lender,
retreated 3.8 percent to 8.83 euros. Banco Comercial Portugues
SA slid 2.8 percent to 63.5 euro cents.  
 Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company, lost
3.2 percent to 3,282 pence. BHP Billiton Ltd., the biggest
mining company, slipped 1.6 percent to 1,920 pence. Xstrata Plc
fell 3.2 percent to 985.3 pence.  
 The stocks initially rallied after Australia’s  Kevin Rudd 
was ousted by  Julia Gillard  as Prime Minister, raising
speculation the government may amend a proposed mining tax.  
 Mining Tax  
 Australian treasurer  Wayne Swan  was appointed as deputy
prime minister, signaling the country’s new administration will
avoid any immediate shift in fiscal policy.  
 “The election of Mr Swan is a key signal that the tax will
remain in the policy platform for the election,” said  Tim Toohey , Sydney-based chief economist at Goldman Sachs JBWere,
wrote in a report to clients today. The tax “will be greatly
watered down rather than abandoned.”  
 Adidas declined 4 percent to 40.99 euros as Kepler Capital
Markets lowered its recommendation for the shares to  “reduce” 
from “hold.” Rival Nike, the world’s largest maker of athletic
shoes, dropped 3.8 percent to $69.80 at 12:20 p.m. in New York
trading after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late yesterday.  
 Hennes & Mauritz AB  fell 3 percent to 220.4 kronor after
Europe’s second-largest clothing retailer report sales in the
three months through May that missed analyst estimates.  
 Revenue increased 2 percent from a year earlier to 27
billion kronor (3.5 billion). That compares to the 27.7 billion
kronor median  estimate  of 22 analysts. Sales growth lagged
behind the 14 percent gain in first-quarter revenue reported by
Spanish competitor Inditex SA.  
 Micro Focus Slides  
 Micro Focus International Plc tumbled 13 percent to 460
pence, the biggest decline in the Stoxx 600. The U.K. business
software maker said Chief Financial Officer  Nick Bray  had left
the company and is in talks with a “strategic competitor”
about accepting a position.  
 Dana Petroleum Plc plunged 7.8 percent to 1,166 pence, the
biggest drop since November 2008, after the U.K. oil and gas
explorer said two wells won’t produce hydrocarbons.  
 Logitech International SA sank 5.9 percent to 15.84 Swiss
francs as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research cut its
recommendation on the world’s biggest maker of computer mice to
 “underperform”  from “buy.”
