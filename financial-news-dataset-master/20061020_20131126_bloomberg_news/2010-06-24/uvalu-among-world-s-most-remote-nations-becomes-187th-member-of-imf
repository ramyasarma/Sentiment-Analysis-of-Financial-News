             Tuvalu, an island nation in the
South Pacific that’s threatened by rising sea levels, officially
became the 187th member of the International Monetary Fund.  
 The agreement was signed today in Washington by Lotoala
Metia, the country’s finance and economic planning minister, the
IMF said in an e-mailed statement. The Washington-based fund has
rescued countries from Angola to Greece over the past two years.  
 “With its size and remoteness, Tuvalu faces a unique set
of economic challenges,” IMF Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said in the statement. “I am confident that fund
membership will help Tuvalu strengthen its economic footing.”  
 According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s World
Factbook, the former British colony has a population of about
10,500 and consists of nine coral atolls about halfway between
Hawaii and Australia.  
 Tuvalu, with a land mass of 16 square miles (26 square
kilometers), derives royalties from leasing its rights to
“.tv” as part of Internet domain names, according to the U.S.
The country’s residents are concerned that global warming will
raise sea levels and force them to evacuate, according to the
U.S.  
 The CIA calls Tuvalu “one of the smallest and most remote
countries on Earth.”
