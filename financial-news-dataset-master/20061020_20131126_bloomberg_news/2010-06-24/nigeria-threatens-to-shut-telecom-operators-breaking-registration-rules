             Nigeria will shut down any telecom
operator flaunting a government directive for all subscribers of
mobile phones to be registered, Minister of Communication and
Information Dora Akunyili said on the state-owned Nigerian
Television Authority late yesterday.  
 “If you don’t want to register SIM cards, please shut down
before we shut you down,” Akunyili said at a meeting with
representatives of the telecom operators, NTA reported.  
 Nigeria, which has the fastest growing telecom industry in
Africa, began the registration of new subscribers in May. The
exercise is aimed at curbing the use of mobile phones in crimes
including armed robbery and kidnapping in Africa’s most populous
nation.  
 The registration involves operators obtaining information
of new subscribers such as fingerprints and digital passport
photos. Before now, mobile-phone subscribers simply walked into
shops and bought ready-to-use SIM cards, without being asked for
any form of identification.  
 Registration of existing subscribers will begin at a later
date, the Nigerian Communications Commission, which regulates
the industry, said this month.
