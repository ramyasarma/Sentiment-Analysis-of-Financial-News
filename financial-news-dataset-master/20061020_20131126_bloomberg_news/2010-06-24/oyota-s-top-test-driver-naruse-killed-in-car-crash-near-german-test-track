             Toyota Motor Corp. ’s chief test
driver, Hiromu Naruse, was killed in a car accident yesterday in
Germany, the world’s largest automaker said.  
 Naruse, 67, died following the accident near a test track,
the New York Times reported yesterday, citing the German
newspaper Rhein-Zeitung. A  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  vehicle
driven by another test driver was involved in the accident, the
cause of which is still unclear, according to the report.  
 “We are surprised by the sudden sad news,”  Mieko Iwasaki ,
a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Toyota, said by phone today. “We
express our heartfelt sympathy to people who were in the
accident.” Iwasaki declined to comment on the details of the
accident pending an investigation.  
 Naruse joined the Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker in 1963
and was involved in developing sports cars including the 2000GT
and Lexus LFA, according to the Times report.
