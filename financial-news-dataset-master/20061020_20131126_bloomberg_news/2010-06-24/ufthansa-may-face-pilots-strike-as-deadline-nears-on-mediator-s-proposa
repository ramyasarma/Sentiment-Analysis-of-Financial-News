             Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-largest airline, may face a new round of pilot walkouts
if both sides refuse to accept a mediation proposal made
yesterday amid a dispute over pay and working conditions.  
 Pilots could move “very quickly to conflict action” if
the mediation fails,  Joerg Handwerg , a spokesman for the
Vereinigung Cockpit union, said today in a telephone interview.
The union may announce its decision as early as noon in
Frankfurt, he added.  
 Lufthansa and the union have until 7 p.m. to consider a
proposal by mediator Klaus von Dohnanyi, the former mayor of
Hamburg.  Claudia Lange , a spokeswoman for Lufthansa, confirmed
the mediation proposal and declined to provide further details
ahead of today’s deadline.  
 The Cologne, Germany-based carrier’s pilots walked off the
job on Feb. 22, wiping out hundreds of flights and  costing 
Lufthansa about 50 million euros ($62 million), in a dispute
over wages and working conditions. Further strike action was
halted by a court ruling and avoided after the two sides agreed
in April to mediate the dispute.  
 Pilots have been seeking a pledge that lower-paid crews
from newly-acquired carriers won’t be used at the main German
units. Lufthansa aims to cut 1 billion euros from expenses
through 2011 and is seeking 10 percent in cost-savings from
cabin crews and pilots.  
 Lufthansa  fell  12.5 cents, or 1 percent, to 11.91 euros at
10:40 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 38 percent in the
past 12 months, valuing the carrier at 5.5 billion euros. Air
France-KLM Group is Europe’s largest carrier.
