             ING Groep NV sold its stake in
India’s  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.  for 8.03 billion rupees ($174
million), according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  
 ING, the largest Dutch financial-services company, sold
about 10.7 million shares at 750 rupees apiece, the people said,
declining to be identified as they aren’t authorized to discuss
the deal publicly. Citigroup Inc. is managing the sale. The
people didn’t say who bought the shares.  
 ING spokesman  Raymond Vermeulen  wasn’t immediately
available for comment outside normal working hours in Amsterdam.
Arun Raste, a spokesman for Kotak Mahindra in Mumbai, couldn’t
be reached on his mobile phone.  Debasis Ghosh , a Mumbai-based
spokesman at Citigroup, declined to comment.  
 The Dutch company was seeking to sell the shares for 730
rupees to 750 rupees each, Reuters reported earlier today.
