             Cattle futures rose for the first
time in three days on signs that beef demand is increasing as
importers boost purchases and U.S. grocers stock up for summer
grilling. Hogs dropped.  
 U.S. exporters sold 14,710 metric tons of beef the week
ended June 17, up 42 percent from a week earlier, the Department
of Agriculture said today. U.S. demand may rise for the
Independence Day holiday on July 4, when many consumers grill
outdoors. Inventories at the end of May were 13 percent smaller
than a year earlier, the USDA said on June 22.  
 “We had good export sales on cattle, well above a year
ago,” said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “And people may buy a
lot of product for the Fourth of July. We’ll see a lot of sales
in stores.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.65 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 89.15 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price dropped 0.9 percent in the previous two
days. The commodity has climbed 8.1 percent in the past 12
months.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained 0.775
cent, or 0.7 percent, to $1.12675 a pound.  
 Cattle futures earlier dropped as much as 0.3 percent as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell for the fourth straight day
on Greek-debt concerns.  
 Cattle are “still shook up about the stock market,” said
 Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in Oklahoma
City. “The stock market has been a big driver lately, and there
is still a lot of uncertainty.”  
 Hog Market  
 Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.975 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 83.25 cents a pound. Earlier, the price rose as much
as 0.5 percent. The most-active contract has gained 42 percent
in the past year as U.S. producers cut herds.  
 Wholesale pork  prices dropped 0.6 percent yesterday to 83.8
cents a pound, according to the USDA.  
 Futures may rebound because the USDA is expected to report
tomorrow that the U.S. hog herd is shrinking, Northstar’s Mayer
said. The  breeding herd  may have been 3.5 percent smaller on
June 1 than a year earlier, according to the average estimate of
11 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “We’ve got the hog and pig report on Friday afternoon, and
people are jockeying to figure out what position to take,”
Mayer said.  
 Farmers slashed herds after losing $6 billion from late
2007 to early 2010 as the recession and swine-flu concerns
eroded pork demand, according to University of Missouri
estimates.
