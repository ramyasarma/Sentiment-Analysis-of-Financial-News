             Dubai  oil, a Persian Gulf benchmark
for Asia, will sell at a narrower discount to Oman crude futures
in September than for August as the emirate increased its
formula for the fourth time this year.  
 The official selling price for Dubai crude loading in
September will be set at a discount of 20 cents to the Oman
futures contract for that month, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Department of Petroleum Affairs. The
discount narrowed from 25 cents for August. The July spread was
at 15 cents.  
 The Oman futures contract is the only product traded on the
 Dubai Mercantile Exchange , which released the price differential
provided by the Department.  
 The final September price will be calculated on the last
day of trading for that month’s contract on the DME, when the
Oman level is set. Oman crude for August delivery fell $1.72 a
barrel to $73.96, according to today’s settlement price from the
 DME . The September contract dropped 62 cents to $74.92.  
 Crude oil for August delivery declined 65 cents in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $75.70
a barrel at 12:50 p.m. in Dubai.  
 Dubai’s Department of Petroleum Affairs usually issues the
price formula for its crude on the last Thursday of every month
to apply to the closing three months ahead. The DME’s futures
contract also sets the price for Oman’s more than 800,000
barrels a day of production.
