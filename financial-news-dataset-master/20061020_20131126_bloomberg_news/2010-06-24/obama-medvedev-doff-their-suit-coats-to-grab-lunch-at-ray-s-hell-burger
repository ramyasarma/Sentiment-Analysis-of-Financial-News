             There was no confining President
 Barack Obama  and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  to a formal
White House luncheon. After their meeting today, the two world
leaders decided it was time for a hamburger.  
 Obama and Medvedev, accompanied by their attendant
entourages, loaded up in a motorcade and took a six-minute ride
to the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia, home to Ray’s
Hell Burger, before their joint news conference this afternoon.  
 Having doffed their suit-coats, Obama and Medvedev, joined
by two translators, ate their hamburgers at a table in the
restaurant surrounded by the regular lunch crowd.  
 Obama had a cheddar cheese burger with onions, lettuce,
tomato and pickles, washed down with an iced tea. Medvedev
selected a cheddar cheese burger with onions, jalapeno peppers
and mushrooms. He ordered a Coca-Cola.  
 Medvedev arrived in Washington earlier today for talks with
Obama before the Group of 20 summit in Canada this weekend.  
 The two leaders and members of their staffs spent about two
hours meeting at the White House earlier today. After lunch they
were scheduled to hold a White House news conference before
Medvedev gives a speech at the U.S.-Russia Business summit.  
 This is Obama’s second trip to Ray’s, which is rated by
Washingtonian Magazine as one of Washington’s “very best” and
boasts 10-ounce burgers customers can top with seared foie gras,
guacamole or roasted bone marrow. Obama and Vice President  Joe Biden  visited the restaurant in May 2009.
