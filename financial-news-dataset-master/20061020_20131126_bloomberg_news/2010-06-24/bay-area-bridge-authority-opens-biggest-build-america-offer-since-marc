             The  Bay Area Toll Authority , which
is  financing  the new  San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge , sold $1.5
billion of Build America Bonds in the largest issue since the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia sold $2.2 billion in
March to pay for nuclear plants.  
 The offering, rated fifth-highest by Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard & Poor’s at A1 and A+, respectively, was
scaled back from the scheduled $1.75 billion after a callable
option -- giving the issuer the right to redeem before the due
date -- was dropped, said  Brian Mayhew , the chief financial
officer of the authority. Yields were raised to appease concern
about outstanding debt, according to an investor.  
 “The authority has a lot of bonds outstanding already,”
said  Bud Byrnes , chief executive officer of Encino, California-
based RH Investment Corp., which specializes in the state’s
debt. “The underwriter made a good-faith attempt to bring it at
lower levels and the market wanted more,” he said, referring to
the final yield offered. “Investors got a good price but the
authority also did well.”  
 The $250 million of securities maturing in 2030 priced to
yield 6.79 percent, 275 basis points above the 30-year Treasury
used as the deal’s benchmark. The $400 million portion due in
2040 was 287.5 basis points more than the benchmark, and the
$850 million maturing in 2050 yielded 7.04 percent, 300 basis
points above. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch managed the group handling the sale.  
 The $250 million portion was forecast to price 250 basis
points above the benchmark, according to Informa Global Markets,
a London-based financial analysis company. The 2040 tranche was
initially set at $500 million and expected to price 275 basis
points above while the 2050 maturity originally stood at $1
billion with a predicted 287.5 basis-point premium.  
 Toll Increase  
 The authority, an Oakland-based agency that finances bridge
construction using tolls from seven such state-owned structures
around San Francisco, is borrowing against levies to finance the
$6.3 billion project. The bridge was damaged by an earthquake in
1989. Traffic on Bay Area bridges is forecast to shrink 1
percent this fiscal year and remain the same until fiscal 2012
when a half percent rise is expected, according to the offering
documents. Most of the tolls are  set to jump  to $5 from $4 in
July, to help cover the increased borrowing.  
 “We priced them as tightly as we thought we could and to
get the value of what the bonds are worth,” said Mayhew.
“There was a callable option that we decided we didn’t need and
that was the reduction.”  
 Previous Issue  
 The biggest sale of Build America Bonds this year was by
Georgia’s municipal electricity authority, which issued the debt
to help fund the building of two nuclear reactors. The agency
was established in 1975 by the state assembly to end local
municipalities’ dependency on private power companies, according
to the MEAG  website .  
 BATA last sold Build Americas in October, issuing $1.3
billion maturing in 2049 priced to yield 6.26 percent, or 200
basis points above  30-year Treasuries . The securities traded
June 22 at an average yield of 5.97 percent, or 187 basis points
above the Treasury. The debt has averaged an 84 basis point
spread above the Wells Fargo Build America Bond index since the
sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Payments on today’s Build Americas will be subordinate to
BATA’s $5.6 billion in outstanding debt, and $2.3 billion in
interest-rate swaps, preliminary offering documents show. The
authority has authorized the issuance of as much as $4 billion
in debt before Dec. 31, and may authorize further borrowing
after that, the documents show.  
 The reliance on fixed-rate debt to finance its projects
marks a shift for the toll authority, which in 2006 and 2007
sold $2 billion of floating-rate bonds coupled with interest-
rate swaps intended to guard against a rise in borrowing costs.  
 Strategy Backfired  
 That strategy backfired amid the credit crisis. In July,
the toll authority paid $105 million to back out of $1.07
billion of swaps with New York-based  Ambac Financial Group Inc .  
 Build America Bonds, created last year as part of the
economic stimulus program, are the fastest-growing part of the
$2.8 trillion municipal market. Issuers are eligible for a 35
percent subsidy on interest rate costs from the U.S. Treasury.
About $116 billion of the securities have been sold, Bloomberg
data show.  
 The authority’s offering comes as the future of the
program, which is set to expire in December, is still
undetermined. A two-year extension is included in a Senate bill
awaiting action. Passed by the House of Representatives May 28,
the provision would cut federal subsidies to borrowers to 32
percent in 2011 and 30 percent in 2012.
