             Royal Dutch Shell Plc faces further
delays on approval for its Prelude floating liquefied gas
project in the Browse Basin after Environment Minister Peter
Garrett deferred a decision until July 30, the Australian
Financial Review reported. The delay comes as Shell refuses to
commit to specific measures to minimize greenhouse gas emissions
on the A$5.7 billion project, the newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.
