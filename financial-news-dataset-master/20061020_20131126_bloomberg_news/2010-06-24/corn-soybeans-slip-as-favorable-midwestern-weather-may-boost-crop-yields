             Soybeans declined for a third
straight day and corn fell for a fourth on speculation that
favorable weather in the U.S. in the next week will boost
prospects for recently planted crops.  
 Dry, cool weather moving into Iowa and Illinois, the
biggest growers of corn and soybeans, may increase crop yields,
MF Global said in a report yesterday. As much as six times the
normal amount of rain fell in the region over the past two
weeks, National Weather Service data show.  
 “We have a really nice corn crop out there,” said  Jon Marcus , the president of Lakefront Futures and Options LLC in
Chicago. “There are some wet areas that may need to be
replanted. The weather is going to put pressure on prices. We’re
in a typical growing season right now.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 11.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $9.12 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have declined 2 percent this week.  
 Soybean prices will decline to $9 a bushel in September and
$8.75 next March as production increases in South America,
Rabobank said today.  
 Corn futures for December delivery slipped 1 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.645 a bushel. The price has declined 12 percent
this year.  
 Corn rose earlier after a U.S. Department of Agriculture
report showed exporters sold 1.46 million metric tons of corn in
the week that ended on June 17, up 19 percent from a week
earlier.
