             South Korea, Asia’s second-biggest
grain importer, said its planted area for wheat more than
doubled this year, exceeding a government forecast.  
 The government has encouraged domestic production to secure
supplies after grain prices soared to records in 2008.  
 Planted area for the grain, used to make bread and noodles,
rose to 12,548 hectares (31,007 acres) in the crop year that
ended this month, from 5,067 hectares in 2009, the statistics
office said in an e-mailed statement today. That is larger than
the government’s projection of 8,600 hectares, it said.  
 The Asian nation imports 99.8 percent of its wheat, mostly
from the U.S., and aims to meet 10 percent of its needs, or
200,000 metric tons a year, from domestic output by 2017, the
statement said.  
 Wheat futures in Chicago reached an all-time high of
$13.495 a bushel on Feb. 27, 2008. The September-delivery
contract traded at $4.77 a bushel at 10:58 a.m. in Seoul.
