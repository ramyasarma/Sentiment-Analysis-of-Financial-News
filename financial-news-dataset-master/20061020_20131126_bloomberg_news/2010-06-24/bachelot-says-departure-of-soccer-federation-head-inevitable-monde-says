             French health and sports minister
Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin said that the departure of the head of
the country’s soccer federation, Jean-Pierre Escalettes, is
“inevitable,” Le Monde reported.  
 Bachelot-Narquin said that while the government has no
power to require Escalettes to resign, it’s now time for him to
retire, according to Le Monde, which cited comments from
Bachelot-Narquin made on the RTL radio station.  
 France’s participation in the World Cup was marred by the
refusal of the team to train after striker Nicolas Anelka was
sent home for insulting coach Raymond Domenech. France was
eliminated without winning a match.
