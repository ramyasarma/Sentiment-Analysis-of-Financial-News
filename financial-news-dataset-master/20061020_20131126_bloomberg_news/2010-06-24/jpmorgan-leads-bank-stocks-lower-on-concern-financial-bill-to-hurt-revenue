             JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Morgan
Stanley led bank stocks lower, and bearish option trades jumped,
on concern that financial-reform legislation due to be completed
as soon as today may reduce Wall Street revenue.  
 The  S&P 500 Financials Index , which includes 79 financial
firms, dropped as much as 2.2 percent as JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo & Co. fell as much as 3.8 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped
as low as $24.22, its lowest intraday level since May 2009.
Trading of puts to sell the  Financial Select Sector SPDR 
exchange-traded  fund  was 2.6 times the four-week average.  
 Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are
negotiating the final language of legislation that may limit
banks’ trading in over-the-counter derivatives as well as how
they invest their own capital. Some analysts say the proposed
laws have become tougher in recent weeks.  
 “It’s starting to really cross over, quite clearly, not
into the area of financial regulatory reform but into punishment
of Wall Street,”  Brian Gardner , a former congressional staffer
who is now a Washington analyst for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Inc., said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television.
“It’s become a net negative.”  
 The House and Senate conferees are debating a ban on
proprietary trading, nicknamed the Volcker rule after former
Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , as well as a provision
championed by Arkansas Senator  Blanche Lincoln  that would
require commercial banks to push out their swaps-trading
operations.  
 Analysts Cut Estimates  
 The legislation comes as analysts reduce their forecasts
for bank and securities firm earnings in the second quarter
because of a reduction in investment banking and deterioration
in markets in May and June. Barclays Capital analysts slashed
their estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s second-quarter
earnings per share 63 percent yesterday to $1.95 from an earlier
forecast of $5.35.  
 “There’s so much uncertainty around it and that’s why
people are scared,” said  Kevin Nichols , vice president for ETF
strategy at Newedge Group in New York. “It also has to do with
regulators coming in to an industry that’s facing a lot of other
headwinds like slower investment banking business, analysts
cutting projections and lower volumes in equities.”  
 The S&P 500 Financials Index was down 1.95 percent as of
11:42 a.m. and JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
dropped $1.16, or 2.98 percent, to $37.73.  
 Almost 485,000 puts to sell the financial ETF changed
hands, 18 times the number of calls giving the right to buy. The
ETF tracking 79 companies fell 1.7 percent to $14.27 as all but
two members  retreated .  
 The  most active contracts  were August $13 puts, which rose
37 percent to 37 cents and accounted for almost a third of all
options trading. The ETF hasn’t closed below $13  since July .
