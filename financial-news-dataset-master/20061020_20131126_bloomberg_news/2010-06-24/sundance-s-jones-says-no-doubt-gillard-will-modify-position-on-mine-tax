             (Corrects title for George Jones in second paragraph.)  
 There’s “no doubt” that  Julia Gillard , who ousted  Kevin Rudd  as Australian prime minister
today, will change the government’s proposed 40 percent tax on
mining projects,  Sundance Resources Ltd . said.  
 “I wouldn’t be surprised by the end of the day if she
announces the current proposal is being withdrawn,” former
Chairman and Strategic Adviser  George Jones  told Bloomberg
Television. “There’s an acceptance within the mining industry
that a renegotiation of these taxes is going to happen.”  
 Rudd, who served the shortest term as leader since 1971,
stood down after Gillard challenged his leadership in Canberra
today. Gillard took the leadership and needs to be sworn in by
Governor-General  Quentin Bryce  as the country’s first female
prime minister.  
 The Rudd government in May announced a proposal to levy a
40 percent tax on the profits of mining companies, drawing
criticism from the resources sector with Xstrata Plc and
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. putting expansions worth $21
billion on hold.  
 “Julia is going to instill a process more akin to the
proper democratic way of doing it and perhaps take time as she
should for this very significant issue,” said Jones. He was
speaking by phone from West Africa where he is oveseeing the
recovery effort following a plane crash over the weekend that
killed all of the board of Sundance Resources, an iron ore
developer.
