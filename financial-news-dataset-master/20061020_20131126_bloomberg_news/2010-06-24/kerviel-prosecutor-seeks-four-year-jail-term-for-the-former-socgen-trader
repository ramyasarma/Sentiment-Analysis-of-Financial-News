             Jerome Kerviel  should serve four
years in prison for his role in  Societe Generale SA ’s 4.9
billion-euro ($6 billion) loss, French prosecutor  Jean-Michel Aldebert  said in his closing arguments to judges in Paris.  
 Kerviel, 33, is accused of abuse of trust, faking documents
and hacking the bank’s computers. The trading loss occurred as
the bank unwound 50 billion euros in positions he’d built up by
January 2008, far beyond his trading limits, and concealed with
faked hedges and forged orders.  
 “Jerome Kerviel is a liar, a trickster, and a fraudster,”
Aldebert said. “I ask you to declare him guilty of the
charges.”  
 Kerviel has insisted that his actions were “professional
errors” rather than crimes. He told the court earlier in the
trial that the faked documents were so simple anyone would have
known they were forgeries, his excuses were so far-fetched they
shouldn’t have been believed, and that the money he was using
was always visible to the bank.  
 The recommended sentence is “very, very heavy,” Kerviel
lawyer  Olivier Metzner  said outside the courtroom. Kerviel’s
goal “was to make money for the bank.”  
 Metzner will deliver closing arguments tomorrow, on the
trial’s final day. Societe Generale yesterday asked to be
awarded the 4.9 billion it lost in damages.  
 ‘Destructive Genius’  
 Aldebert said Kerviel should receive a five-year sentence,
with one year suspended, calling him “a destructive genius.”
He could have sought a 375,000-euro fine in addition to the
prison term.  
 Kerviel “cynically exploited holes in the control
process,” Aldebert said. He “has tried to sow confusion during
the hearing, to make the bank his accomplice.”  
 Kerviel “is an actor. He is someone who hides and lies,”
Philippe Bourion, another prosecutor, told the court. “That is
not the behavior of someone who is acting with the support of
his superiors, whose boss is saying ‘Go, go go!’”  
 The three-week long trial has featured more than 30
witnesses, including Kerviel’s bosses, colleagues and bank
controllers.  Daniel Bouton , Societe Generale’s chief executive
officer at the time of the loss, called the former trader’s
conduct a “catastrophe” for the bank.
