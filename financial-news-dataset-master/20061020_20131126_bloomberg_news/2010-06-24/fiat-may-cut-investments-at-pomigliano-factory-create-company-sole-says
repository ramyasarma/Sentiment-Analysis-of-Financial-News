             Fiat SpA  may cut investments or
create a new company to manage its Pomigliano car factory, Il
Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 Fiat may either reduce its investment and production
targets at the site or set up a new company to rehire employees
who support the Italian carmaker’s proposals, the newspaper
said.
