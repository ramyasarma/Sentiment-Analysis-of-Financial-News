             Gold, little changed in New York
trading, may decline for a second day as some investors sell the
metal to lock in gains from this week’s rally to a record.  
 Bullion futures reached an all-time high of $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21, while holdings in exchange-traded funds backed
by gold are at records. The Federal Reserve yesterday retained a
pledge to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low for
an “extended period” and signaled that European indebtedness
may harm American growth. European equities fell.  
 “There could be a bit of profit-taking,” said  Afshin Nabavi , a senior vice president at bullion refiner MKS Finance
SA in Geneva. “After making new highs early this week, it’s
probable we could see a correction down to about the $1,220-
$1,225 area. But with all the mess going on in the economy, one
has to buy on dips.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August lost $3.40, or 0.3
percent, to $1,231.40 an ounce at 8:04 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.5 percent
lower at $1,230.82.  
 Bullion rose to $1,233.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,226.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Gold is heading for a weekly loss after advancing for four
straight weeks as investors sought to protect their wealth amid
the European sovereign-debt crisis. The metal is up 12 percent
this year and is headed for a 10th consecutive annual gain, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920.  
 The Fed said that falling prices for energy and other
commodities were undercutting inflation.  
 Weakness May ‘Bleed’  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  of equities declined for a third
day, falling as much as 1.1 percent. The index has declined 7.5
percent from this year’s high on April 15 even after the
European Union last month unveiled a 750 billion-euro ($921
billion) loan package aimed at stopping the euro region’s
weakest members from defaulting.  
 “We fear that weakness in the equity markets shall bleed
over into the gold market, as margin clerks again begin to look
for places where liquidity can be found,” said  Dennis Gartman ,
an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based
Gartman Letter.  
 Assets held by Canada’s Central GoldTrust exchange-traded
fund jumped 207,842 ounces to 610,832 ounces yesterday, its
website showed. The fund said it  sold  5.73 million units to a
group of underwriters led by CIBC World Markets, raising $280.2
million. The units were primarily sold to investors in the U.S.
and Canada, the fund said in a statement on its website.  
 ‘Reduced Upside Potential’  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest ETF backed by
bullion, were unchanged at a record 1,313.13 metric tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs rose 1.4 tons to 2,051.9 tons yesterday,
according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 Gold has “reduced upside potential” as investors seek
riskier assets such as steel, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst
 Vasily Nikolaev  wrote in a report dated today. China’s steps to
possibly loosen the yuan’s peg to the dollar “could see
investors adopt a higher risk appetite, thus putting pressure on
defensive gold equities. We see a significantly improved risk-
reward in steel after the selloff.”  
 Silver for September delivery in New York fell 0.8 percent
to $18.35 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery declined 1.6
percent to $1,550 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
lost 1.4 percent to $467.95 an ounce.
