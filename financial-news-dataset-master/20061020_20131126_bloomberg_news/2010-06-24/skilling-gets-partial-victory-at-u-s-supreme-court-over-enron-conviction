             The U.S. Supreme Court gave  Jeffrey Skilling  a partial victory on his conviction for leading the
 Enron Corp.  accounting fraud, ruling that he can’t be convicted
of so-called honest services fraud. The court refused to order a
new trial.  
 In a related ruling, the court set aside the corporate
fraud conviction of former Hollinger International Inc. Chairman
 Conrad Black . The justices told a lower to reconsider the case.  
 The justices said the law, which covers fraud schemes to
“deprive another of the intangible right to honest services,”
could be constitutionally applied only to cases involving
bribery or kickbacks.  
 The ruling raises questions about potentially hundreds of
other convictions and pending prosecutions.  
 The effect on Skilling’s 24-year sentence remains to be
seen. His lawyers said before the ruling that a victory on the
honest-services question would give them grounds to seek
reversal of the rest of the conviction, while the government has
said even his conspiracy verdict might not have to be
overturned.  
 Skilling, Enron’s former chief executive officer, was
convicted on 19 counts, and the honest-services ruling directly
concerns only one of those, for conspiracy to commit fraud.  
 He was convicted in May 2006 alongside  Kenneth Lay , the
former Enron chairman who died less than two months later. A
federal appeals court upheld the conviction. Skilling is serving
his sentence in a federal prison in Colorado.  
 Favorite Tool  
 The honest-services statute is a favorite tool of
prosecutors in corruption cases. It is being used against former
Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich , now in trial on an indictment
that includes allegations that he tried to trade the U.S. Senate
seat vacated by President  Barack Obama  for campaign cash or
personal favors.  
 The court rejected Skilling’s contentions that he couldn’t
get a fair trial in Houston and that the trial judge who oversaw
the case didn’t adequately explore indications that some jurors
were biased against him.  
 The case is Skilling v. United States, 08-1394.
