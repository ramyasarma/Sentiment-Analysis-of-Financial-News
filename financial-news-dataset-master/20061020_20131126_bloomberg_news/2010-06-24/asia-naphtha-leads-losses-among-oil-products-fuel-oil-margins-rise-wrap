             Naphtha swaps led losses among oil
products on signs of weaker demand in China for chemicals used
to make plastics and automobile parts.  
 Naphtha  swaps for the month of July lost $1.87 to $71.11 a
barrel at 10:18 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
broker PVM Oil Associates.  Gasoil  dropped $1.70 to $87.60 a
barrel and  fuel oil  fell $8 to $447.25 a metric ton.  
 Front-month naphtha swaps traded at par to August values,
PVM data showed. Yesterday, July swaps traded at a discount to
the later contract, the first time this year that the market has
gone into contango, as Chinese buyers reduced purchases.  
 The International Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-
consuming nations, said in a report yesterday that growth in
world fuel demand will decline over the next five years as the
pace of Chinese consumption slows.  
 The IEA estimates that annual global demand growth will
shrink every year to average 1 percent in 2015, or 940,000
barrels a day, from 1.9 percent, or 1.62 million barrels a day,
in 2010.  
 Naphtha  refining margins in Asia fell 36 cents to a
discount of $3.40 a barrel against Dubai crude, PVM data showed.
 Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai narrowed to $5.70 a barrel from
$5.98 a barrel, while gasoil processing profits declined 19
cents to $13.09 a barrel.  
 Open-specification  naphtha  cargoes delivered in the first
half of August were bid at $654.50 a ton against offers at
$657.50 at 8:38 a.m., data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte
showed.  
 Naphtha  for delivery in the second half of August and the
first half of September closed at $670.63 a ton yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
