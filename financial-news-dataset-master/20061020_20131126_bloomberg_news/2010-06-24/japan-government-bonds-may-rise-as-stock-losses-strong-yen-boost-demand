             Japan’s bonds may rise for a fourth
day as the yen’s gain to a five-week high against the dollar
damps the earnings outlook for exporters, increasing demand for
safer assets.  
 Ten-year  yields , which fell to a seven-year low yesterday,
may extend a loss after global stocks slid. Bonds may also
advance as a report is forecast to show Japan’s consumer prices
dropped in May, adding to signs deflation is lingering.  
 “Japan’s bonds continue to react only to positive
factors,” said  Akihiko Inoue , chief market analyst in Tokyo at
Mizuho Investors Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-
largest bank. “Stock losses may bring down yields.”  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery traded at
141.21 in London from 141.06 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange yesterday. The contract will open for trading at
9 a.m. Tokyo time.  
 The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 fell four
basis points to 1.125 percent yesterday. That was the lowest
level since Aug. 18, 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 The yen touched 89.23 per dollar yesterday, the strongest
since May 21.  The MSCI World Index  fell 1.2 percent. Nikkei 225
Stock Average futures declined, trading at 9,795 in Chicago from
9,910 in Osaka yesterday.  
 Lingering Deflation  
 Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh food slid 1.3
percent from a year earlier in May, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the
statistics bureau reports the data at 8:30 a.m. today in Tokyo.
That will be a 15th-consecutive drop. Deflation enhances the
value of the fixed payments on debt.  
 The 1.3 percent bond due in June 2020 closed at 101.43 to
yield 1.14 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
in Tokyo by Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc., Mizuho Securities Co. and Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.
