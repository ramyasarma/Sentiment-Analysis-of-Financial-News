             South African inflation will
probably slow further in the third quarter as price pressures
“remain relatively benign,” the Reserve Bank’s Chief Economist
 Monde Mnyande  said.  
 “Food price inflation is expected to remain subdued and
the decline of petrol prices during June and possibly July will
further help alleviate inflationary pressures,” Mnyande told
central bank officials and reporters in Pretoria today.  
 Inflation  eased to 4.6 percent in May from 4.8 percent the
month before, moving close to the midpoint of the bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent target range, the statistics office said
yesterday. The Reserve Bank has cut its benchmark interest  rate 
seven times to 6.5 percent since December 2008, and will make
its next interest rate decision on July 22.  
 “CPI inflation is still expected to reach a low point in
the third quarter of 2010,” Mnyande said. “The improved
outlook for inflation is supported by the moderation in
inflation expectations.”  
 The biggest risks to inflation come from “administrative
costs,” Mnyande said. Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-owned
power utility, will raise electricity tariffs an average 25
percent this year and 26 percent next year.
