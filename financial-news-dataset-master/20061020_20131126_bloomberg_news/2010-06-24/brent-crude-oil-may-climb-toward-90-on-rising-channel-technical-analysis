             Brent crude oil may climb toward $90
a barrel after it re-entered a rising “channel” that will draw
prices higher, according to a technical analysis by  Standard
Chartered Plc .  
 Between early May and the middle of this month the contract
has fallen four times below the lower threshold of a channel
that had supported prices for the past year. The commodity has
since risen back into the channel, suggesting a recovery is in
progress, Standard Chartered said.  
 “The push back into the channel is very bullish, as
technically the market had every chance to reverse the bull
trend and put a bear trend in place, but failed to do so,”
London-based analyst  Dan Smith  said in a report yesterday.
“Bullish sentiment should return to the contract toward the top
of the channel, which is currently at $90.”  
 If Brent recovers to $90, further momentum could draw
prices up to a Fibonacci retracement level at $104.98 a barrel
in the longer-term, according to the bank. This corresponds to a
61.8 percent recovery from $147.50 in July 2008 to a four-year
low of $36.20 in December that year. The contract climbed 37
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $76.84 a barrel on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange as of 4:06 p.m. local time. It settled
0.3 percent higher at $76.47 yesterday.  
 The Fibonacci sequence of ratios is used by traders to
predict points of resistance and support as a market retraces
earlier movements.  
 Before advancing to $90, prices will first encounter
resistance when they re-test this year’s peak of $89.58 a
barrel, reached on May 3, Standard Chartered said.
