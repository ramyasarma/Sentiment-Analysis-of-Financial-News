             Connector 2000 Association Inc., set
up by the South Carolina Department of Transportation to run a
toll highway, filed for bankruptcy protection after projected
revenue fell short.  
 The Piedmont, South Carolina-based  association  listed as
much as $500 million in both debt and assets in Chapter 9
documents filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Spartanburg, South Carolina. Chapter 9 is the section of the
bankruptcy code used by government entities seeking to
restructure their debt.  
 The nonprofit association was created to finance, construct
and operate the  16-mile toll road  known as the “Southern
Connector” in Greenville County, and to build the South
Carolina Highway 153 Extension, according to court documents.  
 “The actual traffic on the highway and toll revenues”
from the Connector “have been substantially less than
projected,” officials said in court papers. The association
“is not receiving sufficient toll revenues to pay debt service
on the senior bonds or the subordinate bonds.”  
 The organization’s move to seek court protection comes as
public officials from Detroit to Birmingham, Alabama, are
publicly raising the prospect of bankruptcy during the longest
U.S. recession since the Depression of the 1930s.  
 Near Insolvent  
 Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham and is the
state’s most populous county, has been driven to near insolvency
after a complex $3 billion refinancing of its sewer system
collapsed during the credit crisis. Detroit, the epicenter of
the auto-industry bust, warned of bankruptcy when it borrowed in
March to cover part of a $280 million deficit.  
 Some municipal officials in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the
state capital, are recommending bankruptcy because it can’t meet
$68 million in payments due this year on an incinerator project.
Since 2008, 368 municipal issuers have defaulted on $15.5
billion of municipal debt, according to the Distressed Debt
Securities Newsletter, which tracks bond defaults.  
 While officials at the South Carolina association expected
21,000 vehicles a day, fewer than 7,500 drivers a day used the
highway after it opened, according to court papers.  
 The association has no source of money for repairs and
resurfacing, which may be needed within seven years, at a cost
that “will exceed $15 million,” according to court papers.  
 Bond Prices  
 A Connector 2000 bond maturing in 2023 traded on June 18 at
27 cents on the dollar, to yield 23.6 percent. Zero-coupon bonds
issued to build the road traded on June 21 at about 7 cents on
the dollar to yield 17.8 percent.  
 As of April 30, OppenheimerFunds Inc. held $18.4 million of
Connector 2000 bonds in its  AMT-Free Municipals  fund. Pioneer
Investment Management held $1.5 million in its  Municipal High
Income Advantage Trust  at that time. Oppenheimer was valuing the
bonds at about 11 cents on the dollar.  
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which held $15 million of
Connector 2000 zero-coupon bonds in its municipal fixed-income
funds as of March 31, is valuing them at 3 cents on the dollar.  
 The case is In re Connector 2000 Association Inc, 10-04467,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of South Carolina (Spartanburg).
