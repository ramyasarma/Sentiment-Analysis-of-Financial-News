             China’s stocks  dropped for a second
day as commodity producers fell on concern global economic
growth will falter, overshadowing gains by broadcast companies
on the prospect of industry consolidation.  
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  and Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co. dropped at least 0.5 percent after sales of new homes in the
U.S. sank in May.  Shaanxi Broadcast & TV Network Intermediary Co. 
jumped 5.1 percent after Shanghai Securities News said the
government will announce details of a plan to integrate networks.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  fell 3.13, or 0.1 percent, to
close at 2,566.75, after changing direction at least 10 times.
The gauge has lost 22 percent this year, the world’s fourth-
worst performer, as policy makers limited lending to curb
property speculation and Europe’s debt crisis threatened trade
prospects. Europe is China’s biggest export destination.  
 “The health of the European and U.S. economies remains a
question mark and that’s affecting the growth outlook for
China,” said  Wang Weijun , a Shanghai-based strategist at
Zheshang Securities Co.  
 A report by the U.S. Commerce Department showed new-home
sales tumbled 33 percent last month to a record low annual pace.
Federal Reserve officials retained a pledge to keep the
benchmark interest rate at a record low for an “extended
period” and signaled that Europe’s debt crisis may harm
American growth.  
 Indexes tracking energy and raw material producers were
among the three biggest decliners on the CSI 300 Index, which
was little changed at 2,757.5.  
 Commodity Producers  
 China Petroleum, Asia’s biggest oil refiner, also known as
Sinopec, dropped 0.6 percent to 8.37 yuan. Baoshan Steel, the
listed unit of China’s second-biggest steelmaker, slid 0.5
percent to 6.05 yuan.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the biggest
maker of the lightweight metal and also called Chalco, retreated
0.6 percent to 10.01 yuan.  
 Shaanxi Broadcast gained 5.1 percent to 10.09 yuan.
 Shanghai Broadband Technology Co.  rallied 5.1 percent to 5.78
yuan. China Television Media Ltd. added 3.4 percent to 23.39
yuan while Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group, operator of the
tallest television tower, gained 2.2 percent to 9.33 yuan.  
 China may announce tomorrow the location for trials of
networks that integrate television, telephone and internet
services, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing Wang
Xiaojie, head of the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television’s technology department.  
 Gains Predicted  
 The Shanghai index may climb to the 3,000 level in the
second half as urbanization and the government’s push to move
manufacturing industries into poorer regions increase investment,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., voted China’s most
influential research unit by New Fortune magazine last year.  
 Shenyin & Wanguo joins BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and AMP
Capital Investors Ltd. in boosting their outlook for the
nation’s stocks after the central bank signaled last weekend
that it will loosen the yuan’s peg to the dollar.  
 The yuan may appreciate 3 percent in 2010, while gross
domestic product grows at 10.2 percent this year,  Li Huiyong ,
the Chinese brokerage’s economist, said at a conference today.  
 Insurance stocks gained after industry premiums increased.
China Life Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest insurer, rose 1.1
percent to 24.86 yuan.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. , the No. 2
insurer, added 0.9 percent to 47.19 yuan.  
 Insurance premiums rose 36 percent in the first five months
to 673.7 billion yuan ($98.9 billion), Shi Hong, deputy director
of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission’s general office,
said at a briefing in Shanghai yesterday.  
 Shijiazhuang Baoshi Electronic Glass Co.  a maker of glass
and bulbs for cathode-ray television tubes, jumped the 10
percent daily limit to 9.55 yuan after saying its parent
received more capital from its shareholders.  
 Planned Listing  
 Separately,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  the country’s
largest lender by customers, plans to raise as much as HK$88.4
billion ($11.4 billion) in the Hong Kong portion of its initial
public offering.  
 Agricultural Bank  will offer 25.4 billion shares in Hong
Kong at HK$2.88 to HK$3.48 apiece, the Beijing-based company
said today in a  filing  to Japan’s Ministry of Finance. The
lender will also sell 22.2 billion shares in Shanghai at a price
that hasn’t been disclosed.
