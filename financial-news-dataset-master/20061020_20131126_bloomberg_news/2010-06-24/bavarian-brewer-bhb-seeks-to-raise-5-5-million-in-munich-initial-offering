             BHB Brauholding Bayern-Mitte AG , a
German beer and beverage company, seeks to raise about 4.48
million euros ($5.5 million) in an initial public offering in
Munich next month.  
 BHB will use the proceeds to accelerate its regional
expansion “as a further consolidation among Bavaria’s 674
breweries is to be expected,” management board member Gerhard
Bonschab said at a press conference in Munich today. The company
will also use the funds to repay debt, he said.  
 The brewer, which is based in the southern German town of
Ingolstadt and has 77 employees, owns brands such as  Herrnbraeu ,
a maker of wheat beer that traces its roots back to 1882.  
 BHB is scheduled to start trading on the small-company
segment of the Munich stock exchange on July 8, according to a
statement today.  Baader Bank AG  is managing the sale of 1.6
million shares at 2.80 euros apiece, and about 52 percent of the
company will be freely tradable.
