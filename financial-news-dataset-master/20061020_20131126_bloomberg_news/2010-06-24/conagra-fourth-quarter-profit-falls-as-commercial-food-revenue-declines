             General Mills Inc. , the maker of
Lucky Charms cereal and Progresso soup, said sales will rise to
$18 billion by 2015, driven by international expansion.  
 Adjusted earnings per share will be $3.38 in 2015, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a presentation to
investors and analysts. Net sales were $14.8 billion for the
year ended in May and earnings were $2.30 a share, excluding
items.  
 General Mills projects the  international unit , its fastest
growing division over the last five years, will generate more
than $3.7 billion in sales in 2015, up from $2.7 billion in
2010. The company is also “actively working” to find deals to
expand overseas, particularly in emerging markets such as
Brazil, Russia, India and China.  
 “We think we can further our scale and our category
positions in the categories we are trying to compete in by a
local acquisition or two,” said  Chris O’Leary , chief operating
officer of General Mills’ international division.  
 The company said it has set aside $10 million in fiscal
2011 for increasing its foothold in international markets. China
is projected to contribute $900 million in sales in 2015, up
from the $350 million in 2010.  
 “Most of our emerging market focus to date has been
greater China, but India, Brazil and Russia represent exciting
opportunities as well,” O’Leary said.  
 As the company expects lingering unemployment and the
recession to be a drag on consumer spending in Western Europe,
media promotions such as the sponsorship of the Wimbledon tennis
championship will help increase awareness and household
penetration of its products, the company said.  
 General Mills fell 7 cents to $35.45 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have risen
less than 1 percent this year.  
 Fourth-quarter  profit  fell 41 percent, hurt by divested
products, increased promotions and costs, the company said June
29. This week, General Mills said it’s boosting its quarterly
dividend to 28 cents from 24.5 cents and announced a repurchase
of as many as 100 million common shares.
