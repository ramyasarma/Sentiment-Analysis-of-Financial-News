             Vietnamese  inflation  slowed for a
third month in June as food prices eased, giving the government
room to keep prodding banks to reduce borrowing costs.  
 Consumer prices rose 8.69 percent from a year earlier,
after inflation exceeded 9 percent in each of the previous three
months, according to figures from the General Statistics Office
in Hanoi today. Prices rose 0.22 percent in June from May.  
 State Bank of Vietnam Deputy Governor  Nguyen Van Binh  said
this month that the central bank would try to cut borrowing
costs at the government’s request as interest rates are still
“high” and cutting into corporate profits. The government is
targeting 6.5 percent  economic growth  this year, up from 5.3
percent in 2009.  
 “The government must be relieved that inflation seems to
be coming under control,” said  Ayumi Konishi , the Hanoi-based
Vietnam country director for the Asian Development Bank. “Food
prices have been coming down and the relatively stable foreign-
exchange environment must also be contributing to this.”  
 Prices in the category including rice dropped 0.83 percent
from a month earlier, according to the figures.
