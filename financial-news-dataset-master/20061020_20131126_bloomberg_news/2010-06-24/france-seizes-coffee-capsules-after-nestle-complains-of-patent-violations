             Ethical Coffee Co. said French
authorities seized 50 coffee capsules at two factories after a
complaint by  Nestle SA , which is battling to defend its
Nespresso coffee unit from increased competition.  
 Bailiffs visited plants operated by subcontractors based
in the French towns of Chambery and Tarbes, Ethical Coffee
Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Paul Gaillard  said by phone.  
 “I’m surprised by Nestle’s angle of attack,” Gaillard
said. “They’re basing it on two patents that don’t have
anything to do with our capsules. Nestle told the judge that
we’re infringing the patents on their machines, but we don’t
make machines.”  
 Nespresso faces a challenge in its main market, France,
where Ethical Coffee and Sara Lee Corp. began selling
compatible capsules this year. The brand provided about a fifth
of Nestle’s sales growth last year, excluding acquisitions and
currency swings,  David Hayes , an analyst at Nomura, has
estimated.  
 Sara Lee started selling L’OR Espresso capsules that are
compatible with Nespresso single-serving coffee machines in
French stores in April. Ethical Coffee followed in May with
capsules it says are biodegradable. Consumers who bought a
Nespresso machine previously were committed to using Nestle’s
16 “Grand Cru” and limited-edition varieties, sold only in
boutiques and online.  
 Nestle is revamping Nespresso products ahead of patent
expirations in 2012,  Richard Withagen , an analyst at SNS
Securities, wrote in a note to investors yesterday. Nestle will
face more competition in that year, according to Hayes.  
 Patent Infringement  
 The Swiss company has started collecting evidence related
to patent infringement of the Nespresso system, Ferhat
Soygenis, a spokesman for the Vevey, Switzerland-based company
said in an e-mail. He said it’s “premature” to name the
parties involved and declined to comment further.  
 Ethical Coffee’s capsules are sold by  Casino Guichard-
Perrachon SA , which runs Casino and Monoprix supermarkets.  
 Nestle said June 15 it sued Sara Lee in France for alleged
patent violations.
