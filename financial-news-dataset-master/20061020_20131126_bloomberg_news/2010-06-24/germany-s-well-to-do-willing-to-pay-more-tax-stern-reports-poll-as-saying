             Almost half of German citizens with
monthly net incomes of 4,000 euros ($4,937) or more would be
willing to pay higher taxes,  Stern magazine  said, citing a poll.  
 About 40 percent of the people polled judge the income
situation in Germany as unfair, the magazine said. Fifty-two
percent of German top managers would prefer to focus on wealthy
people if the government decides to increase taxes,  Manager
Magazin  said, citing another poll.
