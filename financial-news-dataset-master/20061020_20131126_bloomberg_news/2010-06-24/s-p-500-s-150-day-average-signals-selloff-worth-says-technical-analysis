             Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ’s 150-
day moving average stopped rising in the middle of last month,
suggesting the benchmark will decline further, said  Carter Worth , chief market technician at Oppenheimer & Co.  
 While the more widely followed 200-day moving average of
the benchmark for U.S. equities has risen every day since
August, the 150-day gauge, which Worth says has more predictive
value, plateaued in mid-May during the 14 percent drop in the
index from April 23 through June 7.  
 Market declines that are sufficiently large to stop an
advance in the 150-day moving average will spur investors who
bought shares prior to the drop to sell them after any bounce
that restores some of their value, Worth said in an interview
this week.  
 “It’s one thing to lose money over time,” he said. “It’s
another thing to be presented with losses right away.” The
market’s recovery from the lows of late May and early June
“doesn’t improve the patterns, it simply leaves a lot of stocks
right at the kill zone. Our thesis is it’s just a recovery in an
otherwise damaged market.”  
 After falling to an eight-month low on June 7, the S&P 500
rebounded as much as 6.4 percent to 1,117.51 on Jun 18. The
index fell for a fourth day today, dropping 1.5 percent 1,076.07
at 11:09 a.m. in New York.  
 The market’s 150-day moving average may provide stronger
clues than the 200-day because it corresponds more closely to
the quarterly cycle on which companies report financial results,
said Worth, who ranked third in last year’s ranking of technical
analysts by Institutional Investor magazine. Technical analysts
base predictions on price and volume chart patterns.
