             A tropical wave over the western
Caribbean Sea has the potential to develop into a tropical
cyclone within days, the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said.  
 The weather system is producing showers and thunderstorms
over parts of Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman Islands
as it moves westward or west-northwestward at 10 miles per hour.  
 “There is a medium chance -- 40 percent -- of this system
becoming a tropical cyclone during the next 48 hours,” the
center said in an outlook  statement  on its website at 2 a.m. New
York time today.  
 An Air Force reconnaissance plane is scheduled to
investigate the system this afternoon, if necessary, the center
said. Tropical waves sometimes develop into depressions and then
storms and are closely monitored by energy and commodity traders
for potential supply disruptions.
