             China’s inbound shipments of
soybeans may fall to 3.5 million to 4 million metric tons in
August from about 5 million tons in previous months after some
crushers canceled import plans on surging arrivals, researcher
grain.gov.cn said in an e-mailed report today. The country’s
soybean meal demand may rise in second half because hog demand
is expected to recover, lifting prices of the animal feed, said
the researcher, which is owned by China National Grain & Oils
Information Center.
