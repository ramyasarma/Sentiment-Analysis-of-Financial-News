             Japan is extending its list of
partners in an agreement to simplify customs procedures at each
other’s checkpoints, Nikkei English News reported, without
saying how it got the information.  
 Japan added the European Union yesterday and may bring on
Canada by the end of the month, Nikkei said. Shipments to and
from the EU and Canada may be fast-tracked starting later this
year, Nikkei said.
