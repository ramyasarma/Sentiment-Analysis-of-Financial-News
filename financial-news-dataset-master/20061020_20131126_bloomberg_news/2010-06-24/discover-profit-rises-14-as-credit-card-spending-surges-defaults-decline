             Discover Financial Services , the
fourth-biggest U.S. payments network, said second-quarter profit
climbed 14 percent as credit-card spending rose to a record and
more customers paid their bills on time.  
 Net income  for the three months ended May 31 was $258.1
million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $225.8 million in
the same period a year earlier, which included a $295 million
gain from a legal settlement, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based
lender said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of 19
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 11 cents.  
 Discover Card sales volume increased 6 percent to a record
$22.9 billion as loans at least 30 days overdue dropped to 4.52
percent, compared with 5.08 percent in the same period last
year. Industrywide, U.S. late payments dropped to 5.26 percent
in May, the lowest since November 2008, Moody’s Investors
Service said in a report yesterday.  
 “We anticipate that sustained improvements in credit
performance will continue to contribute meaningfully to
earnings,” Chief Executive Officer  David Nelms  said in the
statement.  
 Write-offs for loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging
indicator, fell to 7.97 percent in the quarter, better than
Discover’s previous forecast of 8 percent to 8.5 percent, the
company said.  
 Share Performance  
 Discover  gained 7 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $14.08 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
declined 4.8 percent this year through yesterday.  
 Profit in the quarter also was helped by the release of
$277 million from an account to cover future loan losses,
compared with a $299 million addition to the reserve in the same
period a year earlier. Total provisions for anticipated loan
losses declined 44 percent to $724 million.  
 Discover returned $1.22 billion to the U.S. Treasury
Department and paid $11.2 million in accrued dividends under the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, reducing second-quarter earnings
by 13 cents a share.  
 Card issuers’ efforts to capitalize on a consumer shift
from cash and checks to plastic may be hampered by a U.S. Senate
proposal that includes limits on fees merchants pay to accept
debit cards. The legislation, part of the financial-overhaul
bill pending in Congress, also would give retailers the freedom
to refuse credit cards for purchases under $10 and offer
discounts based on the form of payment.
