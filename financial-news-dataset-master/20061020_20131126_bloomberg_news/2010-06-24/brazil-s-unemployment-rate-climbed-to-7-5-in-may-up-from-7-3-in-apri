             Brazil’s  unemployment  rate was
higher than economists expected in May even as officials said
Latin America’s biggest economy is showing signs of labor
shortages in some industries.  
 Unemployment rose to 7.5 percent in May, the national
statistics office said today in Rio de Janeiro. The figure was
higher than the median estimate of 7.1 percent in a  survey  of 31
economists by Bloomberg. Unemployment was 7.3 percent in April.  
 “It’s a sound correction of the labor market, because over
the past months unemployment surprised on the downside several
times,” said  Diego Donadio , an economist with BNP Paribas in
Sao Paulo, in a phone interview.  
 Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said June 17 that the country
is seeing a tighter labor market in certain industries after the
economy expanded at its fastest annual rate since 1995 in the
first quarter, driven by double-digit increases in retail sales.
Gross domestic product rose 9 percent from a year earlier,
faster than any other Latin American economy.  
 The labor market remains tight overall, and the central
bank is unlikely to slow its cycle of rate increases, Donadio
said.  
 The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing
January 2012, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F
exchange, fell 1 basis point to 12.12 percent at 9:37 a.m. New
York time. The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.7902 per dollar.  
 Raising the Selic  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark interest rate to
12 percent from 10.25 percent by year-end as growth expectations
increase, a central bank  survey  of about 100 economists
published June 21 showed. Analysts in the June 11 survey had
forecast a year-end rate of 11.75 percent.  
 Policy makers will raise the benchmark rate, or Selic, by
0.75 percentage point for a third consecutive time at their July
20-21 meeting, according to a weekly central bank survey of
economists taken June 18.  
 “The central bank won’t consider this a change in the
trend of the labor market,” said Jose Francisco de Lima
Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator SA in Sao Paulo, in a
phone interview.  
 Inflation has remained above the government’s  target  of
4.5 percent in every month of 2010, cementing expectations that
the central bank will keep increasing rates. Policy makers began
raising borrowing costs in April after holding the Selic at a
record low 8.75 percent for 9 months.  
 The outlook for 2010 inflation is “markedly” above the
target, the central bank said in the  minutes  of its June 8-9
meeting, at which it raised the benchmark rate to 10.25 percent.  
 Brazil’s economy will grow about 1 percent in the second
quarter from the first quarter, Finance Minister Guido Mantega
said June 22.
