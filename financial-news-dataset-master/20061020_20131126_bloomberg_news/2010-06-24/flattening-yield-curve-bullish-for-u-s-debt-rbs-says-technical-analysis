             The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year Treasury notes over 2-year securities has fallen to
a level signaling further strength in the market for government
debt, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 A close below 2.435 percentage points, “where the primary
steepening trendline comes in,” will indicate a further drop in
yields, wrote  William O’Donnell , managing director in Stamford,
Connecticut, at RBS Securities Inc., in a research note today.
The firm is one of 18 primary dealers that trade directly with
the Federal Reserve.  
 “We’ll need to close below this line to signal a new
flattening trend -- and to open the door to lower long-term
Treasury rates,” O’Donnell wrote. “Until we close through this
line, I think being flat is the right way to go while hoping for
a corrective bounce off of resistance.”  
 The  difference  between 10- and 2-year note yields, charted
on the yield curve, dropped for a third straight day, decreasing
to 2.43 percentage points at 11:23 a.m. in New York. It was the
narrowest on a closing basis since May 26, when the spread fell
to 2.37 percentage points.  
 The 2-year note’s  yield  dropped as much as four basis
points to 0.6329 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 27. It
reached the record low of 0.6044 percent on Dec. 17, 2008. The
10-year note’s yield fell as much as six basis points to 3.0610
percent, the lowest since May 25.  
 Treasuries have returned 5.1 percent this year, with 10-
year notes rising 7.8 percent, outperforming the 1.7 percent
gain in two-year notes, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is a level where orders
to sell may be clustered.
