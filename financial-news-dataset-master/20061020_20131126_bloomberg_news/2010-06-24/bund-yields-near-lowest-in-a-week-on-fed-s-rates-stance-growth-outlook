             The extra  yield  investors demand to
hold Greek government debt instead of German bonds increased to
a seven-week high as growing concern that the economic recovery
may be slowing drove investors to the safest assets.  
 German bunds rose, pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest
in more than a week, as stocks slumped and the Federal Reserve’s
comments yesterday stirred speculation that U.S. interest rates
will stay near zero through next year. The Greek-German spread
is at its widest since May 7, before the European Central Bank
began buying securities to support indebted nations. Greek debt
will leave indexes managed by Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc at
the end of June after the nation’s sovereign credit rating was
downgraded to junk by Moody’s Investors Service last week.  
 “Greek bonds have come under pressure from forced
selling” and support from the ECB “is not convincing,” said
 Peter Chatwell , an interest-rate strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Because Greek debt is
now junk-rated, there are certain indexes which no longer
include Greek bonds.”  
 The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s  benchmark 
government security, fell four basis points to 2.61 percent as
of 4:28 p.m. in London. It reached 2.59 percent earlier, the
lowest since June 15. The 3 percent security maturing July 2020
gained 0.33, or 3.3 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,231) face amount to
103.39, a third straight gain. The two-year note yield also
dropped five basis points, to 0.54 percent.  
 The spread investors demand to hold Greek 10-year bonds
instead of bunds widened to 782 basis points from 772 basis
points yesterday, according to Bloomberg generic data.  
 Bunds, Fed  
 Greek stocks paced an equity decline across Europe today,
as falling bank shares pushed the nation’s  benchmark  down 3.7
percent, the biggest drop since June 7. Credit-default swaps for
Greece rose 38 basis points to a record 970 basis points,
according to CMA DataVision.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros of debt from default for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Bunds are extending gains made yesterday, when a report
showed growth in Europe’s services and manufacturing industries
slowed in June and U.S. data showed purchases of new homes
slipped to a record low. The Fed yesterday kept the target rate
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, and said that “financial
conditions have become less supportive of growth.”  
 The Fed’s move “was widely expected and lends support for
good-quality government bonds, such as bunds and Treasuries,”
said  Andrew Roberts , head of European rates strategy at Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc in London.  
 The 10-year bund yield fell as low as 2.50 percent this
month, the lowest since Bloomberg started collecting the data in
1989, amid concern Europe’s debt crisis may deepen.  
 Italy Auction  
 Bunds were also lifted after a report showed European
industrial orders increased less than expected in April.  Orders 
in the euro area rose 0.9 percent from March, when they jumped
5.1 percent, EU statistics showed today. The median  economists 
estimate forecast orders to increase 1.6 percent.  
 Italy sold 1.5 billion euros of inflation-protected debt
due 2021 at an average yield of 2.72 percent. The nation also
sold 5 billion euros of securities via banks, with that debt
indexed to six-month  Euribor  and maturing in Dec. 2015. The
notes will yield 82 basis points more than Euribor, according to
a banker involved in the so-called syndicated transaction.  
 Italy plans to sell up to 3.5 billion euros of a 2 percent
note due 2013 and up to 3.5 billion euros of a 4 percent bond
maturing 2020 on June 28. The yield  spread  between Italian 10-
year bonds and German bunds widened by four basis points today
to 144 basis points, the most since June 14.  
 Germany will sell 77 billion euros of bonds in the third
quarter of this year, the Federal Finance Agency said today. The
agency originally planned to sell 79 billion euros.  
 Bunds have returned 6.5 percent this year, compared with a
5.1 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Italian securities advanced 1.1 percent,
while Greek debt declined 19 percent, the indexes showed.
