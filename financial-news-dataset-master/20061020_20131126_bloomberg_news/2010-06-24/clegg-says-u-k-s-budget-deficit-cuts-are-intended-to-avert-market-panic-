             Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
said the U.K. could have been the next victim of a “market
panic” sweeping Europe if the government had not raised valued-
added tax.  
 Defending Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s June
22 decision to raise the tax to 20 percent from 17.5 percent,
which Clegg’s Liberal Democrats had campaigned against during
for last month’s election, the deputy prime minister said the
government faces a “black hole” in the public finances that is
“even bigger than we thought.”  
 “The truth is that the world had changed very dramatically
in recent weeks,” Clegg told BBC News today. “We’ve got this
sort of economic firestorm on our doorstep in Europe, where the
markets are putting huge pressure on one country after the next,
knocking on the door in Greece, in Spain, in Portgual, and so
on.”  
 “There’s a real worry that if we don’t take action now,
that we will be the next victim, if you like, of that kind of
market panic,” he said.
