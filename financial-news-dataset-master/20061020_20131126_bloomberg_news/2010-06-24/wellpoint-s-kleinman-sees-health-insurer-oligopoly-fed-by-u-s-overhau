             U.S.  health insurers  are “moving
towards an oligopoly,” a process that this year’s health-care
overhaul will accelerate, the investor-relations chief at
 WellPoint Inc.  said today.  
 New regulations on administrative spending and premium
increases will push some independent insurers out of business or
into deals with bigger rivals, said  Michael Kleinman , vice
president for investor relations, at a Wells Fargo & Co.
conference in Boston. Indianapolis-based WellPoint, the
country’s biggest health plan with  33.8 million  members, has the
scale to prosper from the overhaul, which is expected to add
another 34 million to the ranks of the insured, he said.  
 The insurance market is becoming an oligopoly, a market
where supply and pricing are dominated by a few companies, “and
health-care reform is going to move us in that direction more
quickly,” Kleinman said. “There are going to be smaller
insurers that are not going to be able to survive in this
marketplace.”  
 Led by  WellPoint , 12 health plans cover two-thirds of the
enrollment in the U.S. commercial-insurance market, said  Ana Gupte , a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst in New York, in a
June 11 note to clients.  
 The health-care overhaul is likely to push at least 100
insurers with 200,000 members or less out of the business “as
the plans are increasingly unable to invest in the
infrastructure and technology to effectively manage care,”
Gupte wrote.  
 Consumer Protections  
 Asked to comment today, Nicholas Papas, a spokesman for
President Barack Obama, referred in an e-mail to the president’s
remarks on June 22 touting the health-care overhaul.  
 The law “will put an end to some of the worst practices
in the insurance industry,” such as canceling policies when
patients get sick or imposing lifetime limits on coverage,
Obama, a Democrat, said at a White House ceremony.  
 The changes “will make America’s health-care system more
consumer-driven and more cost-effective and give Americans the
peace of mind that their insurance will be there when they need
it,” Obama said. “Insurance companies should see this reform
as an opportunity to improve care and increase competition.”  
 Angela Braly , WellPoint’s chairman and chief executive
officer, was among a group of insurance chiefs who met Obama
June 22. While Democrats have attacked the company for its
premium increases, the relationship is improving, Kleinman said.  
 “The Obama administration understands that we need to work
in partnership, that in order to make health-care reform work,
the carriers need to be able to charge appropriate rates and
make an appropriate margin,” he said. “Hopefully, a lot of
that bad rhetoric is behind us.”
