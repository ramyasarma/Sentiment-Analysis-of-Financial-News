             India’s natural gas demand may rise
to 120 billion cubic meters a year by 2015 from 62 billion at
present, said B.C. Tripathi, Chairman of Gail (India) Ltd.  
 Domestic supply will total about 84 billion cubic meters by
2015, and there is potential for 18 million tons a year of
additional LNG, Tripathi said at a conference in London today.  
 The country plans to invest $50 billion in developing gas
pipelines, Tripathi said.
