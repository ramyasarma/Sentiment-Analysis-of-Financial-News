             Investor demand for Islamic bond
offerings in the Gulf is strengthening following last month’s
proposed restructuring of Dubai World’s $23.5 billion of debt,
Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. said.  
 The Dubai Department of Finance’s 6.396 percent sukuk
maturing in November 2014 has dropped 271 basis points, or 2.71
percentage point, to 7.58 percent since reaching this year’s
high of 10.29 percent on Feb. 15, according to Bloomberg bond
trader composite prices. The securities’ spread over similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries narrowed 220 to 591 in the same period.  
 Dubai World, one of the United Arab Emirates’ three biggest
state-owned business groups, said on May 20 it reached an
agreement with its main creditor group to restructure its
liabilities, ending a debt crisis that roiled global markets at
the end of last year. Qatar Islamic Bank and Qatari Diar Real
Estate Investment Co. are planning to sell about $2.25 billion
of bonds in coming months.  
 “There is quite a bit of pent-up demand for decent quality
sukuk issuance,” said  Abdul Kadir Hussain , chief executive
officer at Mashreq Capital, which manages $2 billion of mainly
Gulf assets. “People were waiting to see how the restructuring
of Dubai World was going to pan out.”  
 Shariah-compliant bonds have weathered the European debt
crisis better than notes in emerging markets, the U.S. and
Europe. Islamic bonds returned 9.5 percent so far this year,
according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai Listed US Dollar Sukuk Index ,
while regular debt in developing markets gained 5.6 percent,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  EMBI Global Diversified Index  shows.  
 Gulf Sales Slump  
 Global sales of Islamic bonds have fallen 24 percent to
$6.5 billion so far in 2010 from the same period last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sukuk issuances rose to
$20.2 billion in 2009 from $14.1 billion in 2008, the data show.  
 Gulf issuers raised $2.47 billion from sukuk sales since
the end of 2009, about 13 percent less than during the same
period of last year, Bloomberg data show.  
 “The recent lull in issuance is because of the overall
Gulf Arab situation, particularly surrounding Dubai,” said
Hussain. “We’re just starting to come out of that time,
starting to see that there’s an appetite for the region.”  
 Qatar Islamic Bank , the Gulf state’s biggest Shariah-
compliant lender, plans to sell as much as $750 million of bonds
in its first Islamic debt offering, Chief Executive Officer
 Salah Mohammed Jaidah  said on May 19. Qatari Diar may raise
about $1.5 billion by selling global bonds backed by Qatar, the
world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, a person
familiar with the sale plan said on May 12.  
 Jordan, Malaysia  
 Islamic finance transactions are based on the exchange of
assets rather than interest to comply with Shariah principles.
Created in the 1970s, the Islamic finance industry’s assets may
quadruple to $2.8 trillion by 2015 from about $700 billion in
2005, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based Islamic Financial
Services Board.  
 Countries including Jordan and Indonesia are planning sales
this year. Jordan’s Finance Minister  Mohammad Abu Hammour  said
June 23 the government is in discussions with a number of banks
to help sell about $500 million of bonds internationally.  
 Indonesia plans to sell as much as $650 million of Islamic
bonds in October, after scaling back and delaying an original
proposal to raise $750 million in July,  Dahlan Siamat , the
ministry’s director of Islamic financing, said on June 15.  
 Malaysia, the world’s largest sukuk market, raised $1.25
billion selling five-year Ijarah sukuk last month after drawing
bids for more than five times the $1 billion originally offered.  
 The yield on the 3.928 percent Islamic notes due June 2015
was 3.57 percent today, 36 basis points less than when they were
sold on May 27, according to prices from Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. The difference over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries
has narrowed 5 basis points to 175.
