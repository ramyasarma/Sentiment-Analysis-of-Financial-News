             China’s stocks fluctuated. Consumer
companies advanced while shipping lines declined.  
 Dongfeng Automobile Co. added 0.4 percent.  China Cosco
Holdings Co.  lost 0.3 percent after commodity shipping costs
extended their longest losing streak in 14 months.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 6.84, or 0.3 percent, to
2,562.29 as of 9:47 a.m., after gaining less than 0.1 percent.
The gauge has lost 22 percent this year, the world’s fourth-
worst performer, as policymakers limited lending to curb
property speculation and Europe’s debt crisis threatened trade
prospects. Europe is China’s biggest export destination.  
 “The health of the European and U.S. economies remain a
question mark and that’s affecting the growth outlook for
China,” said  Wang Weijun , a Shanghai-based strategist at
Zheshang Securities Co.  
 A report by the U.S. Commerce Department showed new-home
sales tumbled 33 percent last month to a record low annual pace.
Federal Reserve officials retained a pledge to keep the
benchmark interest rate at a record low for an “extended
period” and signaled that Europe’s debt crisis may harm
American growth.  
 Dongfeng rose 0.4 percent to 4.98 yuan.  
 The benchmark index may rebound to 3,000 in the second half
of the year as urbanization and the government’s push to move
manufacturing industries into poorer regions boost investment,
Shenyin & Wanguo said in a press release before the start of an
investment conference in Shanghai.  
 China Cosco slipped 0.3 percent to 9.52 yuan. The  Baltic
Dry Index  fell 1.3 percent to 2,515 points, a 19th consecutive
drop and the longest losing streak since April 2009.  
 China’s raw-materials producers are likely to gain in the
near term as the country eases its monetary policy and the yuan
appreciates, according to BNP Paribas analysts  Ryan Tsai  and
 Clive McDonnell .  
 The brokerage’s top recommendations are Maanshan Iron &
Steel Co., Angang Steel Co. and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.
