             Mexico will produce more sugar than
expected in the current crop, making imports of the sweetener
unnecessary, Agriculture Minister Francisco Mayorga said.  
 The country will produce at least 4.8 million metric tons
of sugar from the harvest that ends this month, Mayorga said in
Mexico City today. That compares with a Feb. 18 forecast of 4.5
million tons.
