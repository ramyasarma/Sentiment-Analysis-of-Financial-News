             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index fell,
retreating from a six-week high, after a report showed domestic
unemployment unexpectedly rose in May and amid renewed concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  
 Rossi Residencial SA  led homebuilder declines, spurring the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index’s first drop in four days.
Retailers Lojas Americanas SA and  Cia. Brasileira de
Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar  fell. State oil company
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA  tumbled for a sixth day, its longest
streak in seven weeks, as crude slid in New York.  
 The Bovespa stock index fell 1.4 percent to 64,242.19 at
10:40 a.m. New York time. Sixty stocks declined on the index
while four gained. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index dropped for
the first time in four days, losing 1.3 percent to 1,154.96. The
real weakened 0.3 percent to 1.7930 per dollar.  
 “You had a nice little run; the market is now
correcting,” said  Eric Conrads , a hedge fund manager at Mexico
City-based Armada Capital SA. “People are in wait-and-see mode
until we get to the second-quarter earnings season, to see if
you really need to worry about euro contagion, slowing in
China.”  
 Credit-default swaps on Greek bonds rose to a record today,
reviving concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis may derail
the global economic recovery.  
 Unemployment Rises  
 Brazil’s unemployment rate rose to 7.5 percent last month
from 7.3 percent in April, the national statistics agency said
today in Rio de Janeiro. Economists had forecast the rate would
drop to 7.1 percent, according to the median of 31 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Rossi  fell 2.6 percent to 13.67 reais as the  BM&FBovespa
Real Estate Index  lost 2 percent, the most in three weeks. Lojas
Americanas tumbled 2.8 percent to 13.53 reais and Pao de Acucar
slid 1.1 percent to 62.07 reais. Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-
controlled oil producer is known, decreased 2.1 percent to 27.91
reais, the lowest price since May.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.3 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.7 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.7
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.8 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
