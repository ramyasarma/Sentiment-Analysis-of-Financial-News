             Honda Motor Co.  is boosting the fuel
economy of its top-selling Accord models as Japan’s second-
largest automaker faces tougher competition from Hyundai Motor
Co. and new U.S. mileage requirements.  
 The 2011 Accord sedan and coupe with 4-cylinder engines
that go on sale in August will get an estimated 23 miles (37
kilometers) per gallon of gasoline in city driving and 34 miles
per gallon in highway driving, up from 21 and 31, respectively,
Honda  said  on its website today. The car gets a combined 27 mpg,
said  Chris Martin , a company spokesman.  
 That tops the 26 mpg of Hyundai’s rival 2011 Sonata sedan
and Toyota’s 2011 Camry, according to the U.S. Energy
Department’s  fueleconomy.gov site . Accord sales this year
through May grew 15 percent in the U.S. to 122,588.  
 Honda is based in Tokyo, with U.S. operations headquartered
in Torrance, California.
