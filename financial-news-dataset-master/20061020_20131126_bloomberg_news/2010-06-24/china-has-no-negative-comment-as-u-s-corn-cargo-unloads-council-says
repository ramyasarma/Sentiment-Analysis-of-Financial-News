             China, the second-largest corn consumer,
is unloading its first cargo of the U.S. grain in almost 15 years
and has made no “negative” observations about the shipment,
according to the U.S. Grains Council.  
 “Samples were being drawn on a regular basis,” the council’s
marketing specialist Dan Keefe said on its  website . “There were no
negative comments or observations. The quality was consistent with
a No.2 U.S. FGIS grade and the corn was in good condition,” said Keefe.  
 The shipment of 55,000 metric tons of No. 2 yellow corn arrived
in Longkou port in Shandong province on June 21, cleared customs and
berthed for discharge the following day, said the council. The group
was “on-site” for the arrival, it said.  
 The port operates five cranes discharging at the rate of about
700 tons per hour with very little port congestion, the council said.
The discharging operation is expected to be completed in four days,
weather permitting, and another vessel of U.S. corn is scheduled to
unload in July, it said.
