             Telecom Italia SpA , Italy’s biggest
phone company, is being probed by Italian antitrust regulators
for possible abuse of its dominant position.  
 Telecom Italia allegedly carried out actions aimed at
obstructing competitors, the watchdog said in a  statement on its
website  today. Company offices were searched by the finance
police in the probe, which follows complaints by rivals FastWeb
SpA and Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA, the regulator said.  
 Telecom Italia allegedly operated “technical boycotts” by
refusing or delaying the activation of a “high number” of
phone lines for rivals’ customers, the authority said. The
company is also being investigated for reportedly offering
“significant discounts” to clients in regions where
competition is strongest.  
 Telecom Italia “acted in full compliance with the rules,
on the basis of correct competition behaviors,” it said in a
stock-exchange statement. The company is cooperating with
authorities to “demonstrate that the complaints against
allegedly illegitimate behaviors made by alternative operators
are groundless.”
