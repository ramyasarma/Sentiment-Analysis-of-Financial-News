             French money manager Oddo & Cie lost
a bid to force UBS AG’s Luxembourg unit to return 30 million
euros ($37 million) from a fund that had invested with Bernard
Madoff.  
 Luxembourg’s Cour de Cassation today dismissed Oddo’s
appeal in the case at a hearing today. UBS no longer had the
money after turning it over to the liquidators for a defunct
Luxembourg fund tied to Madoff pursuant to a previous court
ruling.
