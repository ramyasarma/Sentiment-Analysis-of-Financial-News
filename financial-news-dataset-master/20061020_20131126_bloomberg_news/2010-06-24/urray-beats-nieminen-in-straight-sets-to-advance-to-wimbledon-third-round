             Andy Murray, a semifinalist last
year, beat Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen in straight sets on Centre
Court at Wimbledon today.  
 The 23-year-old, who is without a title in 2010, won 6-3,
6-4, 6-2. Murray is aiming to become the first Briton to win the
men’s title at the only grass court Grand Slam since Fred Perry
in 1936.
