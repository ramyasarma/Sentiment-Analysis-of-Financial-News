             Crude oil’s 100-day moving average
above $78 a barrel, currently the first line of resistance on
technical charts, may send “false signals” about the market’s
ability to rally, according to  Societe Generale SA .  
 Oil in New York breached the 200-day moving average on June
15, prompting expectations prices would sustain an advance.
While a test of the 100-day mean is possible in coming days,
this indicator has failed buyers previously, said  Stephanie Aymes , a cross-commodity technical analyst at France’s second-
largest bank by market value.  
 “You can see that the 100-day gave false signals last
February and December,” London-based Aymes said in e-mailed
comments. “It could be sideways or down but I am not bullish,
that’s for sure.”  
 Oil reached a six-week high of $78.92 a barrel on June 21
amid speculation fuel demand in China, the world’s second-
largest energy consumer, will increase. The contract for August
delivery was at $76.28 in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, down 7 cents, at 10:17 a.m. Singapore time.
Futures have lost 4 percent in 2010.  
 Crude on June 21 traded briefly above the 100-day moving
average, at $78.56 a barrel today, without breaching it at the
day’s settlement. Similar moves in early February and mid-
December started rallies that didn’t last.  
 Prices also face resistance at the bottom of an upward-
trending channel that goes back to May 2009, according to Aymes.
Oil dropped out of that channel last month, tumbling to as low
as $64.24 a barrel. Further, the 14-day Relative Strength Index
is near 70, indicating oil has probably risen too quickly.  
 Crude “is approaching the channel around $80.10 and the
daily RSI is close to resistance,” she said.  
 On the downside, “consolidation” can be expected around
$75.40 to $75.60 a barrel, then $74.30 to $74.70, before $73 to
$73.70, Aymes wrote yesterday in a separate note to clients.
