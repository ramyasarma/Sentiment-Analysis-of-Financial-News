             Rubber prices may climb 26 percent next
year as supplies lag behind demand, Royal Bank of Scotland Asia
Securities (Singapore) Pte. said in an e-mailed report.  
 Natural rubber may average $4,500 a metric ton next year, up from
$3,580 a ton year-to-date, as “heavy rainfall in southern Thailand
has disrupted supply” and “inventory levels in China are worse than
we expected,” said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a commodities analyst.  
 Rubber futures advanced 1.5 percent this year to 280.2 yen a
kilogram in Tokyo, or $3,139 a metric ton. The most active contract
climbed 3.6 percent last week on concern rain was affecting Thai crops.  
 Thailand is the world’s largest producer, and China the biggest
consumer. About 70 percent of rubber, tapped as sap from trees, is
used in the auto industry for tires.  
 “This disruption to supply is serious because Thailand accounts
for 31 percent” of world production, Tiruchelvam said.  
 He reiterated his recommendation that investors buy  GMG Global
Ltd. , a producer listed in Singapore, with a 12-month target of 27
Singapore cents. The shares have doubled to 22 cents this year.
