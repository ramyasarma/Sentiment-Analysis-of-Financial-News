             South Korea’s consumer confidence
rose in June for a second month as the nation’s economy
strengthened and the jobs market improved.  
 The  sentiment index  advanced to 112 from 111 in May, the
Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement in Seoul today. The
reading hit a seven-year high of 117 in October. A number
exceeding 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  
 “The European debt woes and geopolitical tension with
North Korea seemed to have little impact on consumer
sentiment,” said Jang Wan Sub, a senior economist at the Bank
of Korea. “They’re pretty optimistic as the economy grows fast
and companies begin to hire more workers.”  
 The country’s economic revival and accelerating inflation
are putting pressure on the Bank of Korea to join  Malaysia  and
India in boosting borrowing costs and raise its benchmark
interest rate from a record-low 2 percent. Government officials
have signaled a shift in their stance in recent days after being
outspoken this year in stating it was too early to raise rates.  
 Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 2.1 percent in the
first quarter on stronger exports and domestic spending and the
Finance Ministry now projects 5.8 percent growth for this year,
revising it up from the 5 percent forecast made in December.  
 The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,123 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between June 14 and June 21.
