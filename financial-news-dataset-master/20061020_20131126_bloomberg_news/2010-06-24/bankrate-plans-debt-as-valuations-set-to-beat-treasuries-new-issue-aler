             Bankrate Inc. , the online personal-
finance network, is marketing debt as corporate bonds may offer
more attractive valuations than Treasuries.  
 Bankrate, which provides interest  information  on products
from credit cards to mortgages, may sell $280 million of five-
year notes to help pay for the acquisition of NetQuote Inc. and
CreditCards.com Inc., according to a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  
 Relative yields on high-risk, high-yield corporate debt are
trading to account for a default rate higher than what “market
watchers” expect in the coming 12 months, Morgan Stanley said
in a June 21 research note. Spreads on junk bonds imply a
default rate of about 7 percent, more than the 4 percent or 5
percent that is expected, the note said.  
 “With valuations that are significantly more attractive in
high yield and slightly more attractive in high grade, as well
as a general lack of yield in other fixed income assets, we
believe investors will be inclined to edge back into both high
yield and investment-grade credits,” the New York-based
securities firm said in the note from analysts led by chief
investment officer  Jeff Applegate  and chief investment
strategist  David M. Darst .  
 The yield on the 10-year U.S.  Treasury bond , the market
bellwether, fell to 3.12 percent yesterday, the lowest since May
2009, from 3.17 percent on June 22.  
 Default Outlook  
 The default rate for U.S. speculative-grade issuers, rated
below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard &
Poor’s, may fall to 2.7 percent by December, Moody’s said
yesterday in an e-mailed report. Fitch Ratings said the pace of
defaults by high-yield issuers has slowed to a full-year rate of
about 1 percent, according to a June 21 report. That compares to
a 13.7 percent rate in 2009 after 151 defaults, Fitch said.  
 “As long as we don’t double-dip, I think high-yield is
going to do fine,” said  Matt Freund , a money manager at USAA
Investment Management Co., who helps oversee $44 billion in
assets in San Antonio, Texas. “The high yield side seems it may
be in a sweet spot here.”  
 Jeffries Group Inc., a New York-based brokerage, sold $400
million of notes due in 2021 and Mexican bakery Grupo Bimbo SAB
issued $800 million of 10-year dollar bonds in yesterday’s
largest corporate debt sales, Bloomberg data show. Sales have
risen 57 percent this week to $14.6 billion through yesterday,
compared with $9.3 billion over the similar period a week
earlier, the data show.  
 Bankrate Acquisitions  
 Bankrate, acquired by Apax Partners LLP in September, is
buying NetQuote and CreditCards.com for a combined cost of about
$350 million, Moody’s and S&P said in separate reports. Moody’s
rated the proposed offering B2, and S&P assigned a B ranking.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own speculative-grade
company debt rose 7 basis points to 682 basis points yesterday.
Junk bond spreads declined to a one-month low of 668 basis
points on June 21, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Spreads on investment-grade corporate debt rose 1 basis
point, to 206 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index.

 DOHA BANK QSC, Qatar’s third-largest bank, may raise as
