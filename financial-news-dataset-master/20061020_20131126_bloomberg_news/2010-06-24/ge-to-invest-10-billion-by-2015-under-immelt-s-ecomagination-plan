             General Electric Co.  will invest $10
billion in environmentally friendly products by 2015, double the
amount it spent in the past five years, under Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey Immelt ’s “ecomagination” program.  
 The 2010 target of investing $1.5 billion a year in new
products tied to the initiative was reached a year early, GE,
the world’s biggest maker of jet engines, power-generation
equipment and locomotives, said in a statement today.  
 Immelt set benchmarks for increasing GE products’ energy
efficiency while reducing their water use and emission of
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and ozone. The revenue
goal was $20 billion a year by 2010. The more than 90 products
linked to the effort generated $18 billion in sales last year,
according to Immelt’s annual  report .  
 “We did a lot of work evaluating the types of innovations
we’re talking about: $10 billion is a big number, but one we
think we’re capable of,”  Steve Fludder , a GE vice president and
program leader, said in a telephone interview. He added that the
goal will be to increase revenue at twice the rate of GE’s total
gain. “We did all the due diligence to verify that these are
commitments we can deliver on,” he said.  
 Greenhouse gas intensity, which GE defines as the ratio of
such emissions to revenue, was cut by 39 percent in 2009,
topping the goal of a 30 percent reduction. The company said
“absolute greenhouse gas emissions” from GE operations were
reduced by 22 percent compared with 2004, the last full year
before the ecomagination initiative.  
 GE, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, fell 40 cents to
$15.39 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
The shares had climbed 1.7 percent this year before today.
