             Germany’s austerity measures are
“moderate in scale” and will “foster growth in the long
term,” the country’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble writes
in the Financial Times.  
 Schaeuble is surprised that one of the “most passionately
debated economic issues of the day” is whether Germany is
acting prematurely in reining in its deficit, he writes.    
 While U.S. policymakers “like to focus on short-term
corrective measures, we take the longer view and are, therefore,
more preoccupied with the implications of excessive deficits and
the dangers of high inflation,” he writes.  
 The country will use a “debt brake,” a “sophisticated
set of fiscal rules” embedded in its constitution to act as a
framework for its exit from emergency fiscal measures, Schaeuble
writes.   
 Germany’s exit from its expansionary policies, to be
implemented next year, is “controlled and measured,” rather
than “slamming on the brakes” and could be described as
“expansionary fiscal consolidation,” he writes.  
 While Germany knows it has a responsibility to promote
growth in Europe, it also has a role as an “anchor of
stability.”
