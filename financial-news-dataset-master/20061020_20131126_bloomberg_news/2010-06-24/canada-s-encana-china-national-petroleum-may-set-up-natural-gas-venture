             Encana Corp. , Canada’s largest
natural-gas producer, may form a venture with  China National
Petroleum Corp.  to produce the fuel from shale formations in
northeastern British Columbia.  
 The companies signed a memorandum of understanding to
negotiate an agreement to develop gas properties in the Horn
River, Greater Sierra and Cutbank Ridge fields, EnCana said in a
statement today. The companies didn’t disclose financial or
other details of the planned partnership.  
 EnCana is looking for venture partners to help reduce the
cost of developing its large tracts of land in gas-producing
regions. Chief Executive Officer  Randy Eresman  said two weeks
ago the company had sold stakes in gas fields worth about $900
million so far this year and could double that amount if the
company finds the right opportunities.  
 The venture with state-owned, Beijing-based CNPC could
“tap natural-gas opportunities that would otherwise remain
dormant for some time,” Eresman said in the statement.  
 The Chinese company, parent of Hong Kong-listed PetroChina
Co., is considering Canadian projects to boost oil and gas
reserves. Last month the company made an agreement with the
government of  Saskatchewan  to assess investments in heavy oil,
natural gas and carbon-capture projects.  
 Calgary-based Encana fell 76 cents to C$33.25 in Toronto.
The companies made the announcement after North American markets
closed.
