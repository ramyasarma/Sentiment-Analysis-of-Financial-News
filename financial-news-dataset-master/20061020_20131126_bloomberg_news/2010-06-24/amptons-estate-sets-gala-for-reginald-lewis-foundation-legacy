             As the Hamptons gala season gets
going on Long Island, one of the early affairs involves a
foundation and a wife’s effort to ensure the legacy of a husband
she regards as “the Jackie Robinson of finance.”  
 Seeking to raise about $350,000 for the Lewis Museum in
Baltimore,  Loida Nicolas Lewis  also wants to raise the profile
of her late husband,  Reginald F. Lewis , former chairman of  TLC
Beatrice International Holdings Inc.   
 Since his death from brain cancer in 1993, Nicolas Lewis
has launched the Lewis College in the Philippines, where she was
born, and made a $5 million gift through his foundation to the
 Maryland Museum of African American History and Culture , which
now bears the financier’s name.  
 “Unfortunately, Reginald has been forgotten,” Nicolas
Lewis, a lawyer, said in a phone interview. “The young people
under 35 don’t know him. For me, he was the  Jackie Robinson  of
finance, for no person of color had done a leveraged buyout as
large as he had done.”  
 In 1987, Lewis’s TLC Group acquired Beatrice International
Foods from Beatrice Cos. for $985 million, at the time the
largest leveraged buyout of an international company.  
 To raise money for the Lewis Museum, she will hold the
 Reginald F. Lewis Foundation ’s third annual summer gala
Saturday. The event, first held in Lewis’s hometown of
Baltimore, was moved to his East Hampton, New York, estate to
attract patrons in finance, entertainment and real estate who
populate the area’s summer fundraising circuit.  
 “Very few of my friends would come to Baltimore, so we’ve
decided that East Hampton will be the place for future galas,”
she said.  
 Broiled Lobster  
 Guests will be served broiled lobster, barbecued ribs and
Long Island corn, and the  Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater 
will perform. Entertainment lawyer L. Londell McMillan, a
partner at  Dewey & LeBoeuf  who has represented  Michael Jackson 
and Prince, will be honored. The gala’s sponsors include
 American Express Co . and GenNx360 Capital Partners Co., a
private-equity firm.  
 The son of working-class parents, Lewis entered  Virginia
State University  on a football scholarship in 1961. After
graduating from Harvard Law School in 1968, he practiced
corporate law in New York.  
 In 1983, he formed TLC Group LP to focus on deal-making and
leveraged buyouts. After TLC acquired Beatrice International,
Lewis started his foundation in 1987 and donated $3 million to
Harvard Law School in 1992.  
 The foundation has made grants to arts and education
organizations such as Alvin Ailey, the  Baltimore School for the
Arts  and Dance Theatre of Harlem. As the foundation expands its
base of patrons, its goal is to give away about $1 million a
year, Nicolas Lewis said.  
 The Reginald F. Lewis Foundation benefit luncheon is
Saturday in East Hampton, New York, at 12:30 p.m., with tickets
$550. Its “Beach Glamour” party for young patrons is from 5
p.m. to 10 p.m., with tickets $250. A ticket for both costs
$700. Information:  http://reginaldflewis.com .
