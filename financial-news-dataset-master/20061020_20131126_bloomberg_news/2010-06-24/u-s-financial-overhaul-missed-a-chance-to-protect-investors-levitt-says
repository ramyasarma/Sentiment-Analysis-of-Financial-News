             Financial-overhaul legislation being
debated by the U.S. Congress doesn’t adequately protect
investors, according to  Arthur Levitt , former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 “The bill, already weakened by deal-making as it emerged
from the Senate, has been bled dry of nearly every meaningful
protection of investors,”  Levitt wrote  in a column posted
yesterday on the Wall Street Journal’s website. Lawmakers in
Washington are working to resolve differences between the bill
the House approved in December and a version the Senate passed
last month.  
 Congress missed an opportunity to address the role that
government-sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac played in causing the financial crisis and should have
limited their activities, Levitt wrote. Lawmakers fell short by
failing to pass a rule that would have required investment
advisers to serve clients’ best interests, he said.  
 Levitt criticized a provision that allows more companies to
avoid audit rules, weakening what he called the “most-important
investor reform of the last decade.” The proposed legislation
keeps in place rules that permit municipal-bond issuers to face
lighter scrutiny than those selling corporate debt, and may
contribute to a crisis for state and local governments, he said.  
 “If the municipal-bond market melts down in the next few
years, we’ll know who to blame,” Levitt wrote.  
 Levitt, chairman of the SEC from 1993 to 2001, is an
adviser to the Carlyle Group and a board member of Bloomberg LP,
the parent of Bloomberg News.
