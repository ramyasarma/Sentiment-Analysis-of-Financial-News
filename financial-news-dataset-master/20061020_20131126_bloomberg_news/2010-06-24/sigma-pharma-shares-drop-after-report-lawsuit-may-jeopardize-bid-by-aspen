             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  fell the
most in six weeks in Sydney trading after the Australian
Financial Review said a possible lawsuit may hurt a A$707
million ($619 million) takeover offer from Aspen Pharmacare
Holdings Ltd.  
 Sigma  declined  5.4 percent to close at 44 Australian cents,
the most since May 12.  
 Aspen said May 21 it will pay 60 Australian cents for each
outstanding share of Melbourne-based Sigma and assume net debt
of A$785 million. Durban, South Africa-based Aspen may alter or
scrap its bid amid a potential class-action suit by shareholders,
the Review reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The African drug company, which is conducting due diligence,
is uneasy about bearing the risk of the lawsuit, the Review said.
 Slater & Gordon Ltd.  plans to approach Sigma next month with the
aim of settling out of court after signing up shareholders, said
the newspaper, citing the Melbourne-based law firm.  
 “There has been no correspondence,” Ian Smith, a
spokesman for Sigma, said in a telephone interview today. “To
comment on something that we read in the newspaper and have no
knowledge of is obviously difficult.”  
 Slater & Gordon officials with knowledge of the matter
weren’t immediately available for comment.
