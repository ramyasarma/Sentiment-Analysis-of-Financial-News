             Orders for durable goods  excluding
transportation  equipment rose in May for the third time in four
months, a sign manufacturing remains a bright spot in the U.S.
economy, economists said before a report today.  
 Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years,
minus autos and aircraft, increased 1 percent last month after a
1.1 percent drop in April, according to the median of 45
projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Total  orders  may fall
1.4 percent, depressed by a plunge in volatile demand for
commercial aircraft, economists said.  
 A pickup in business spending on new equipment in the U.S.
and abroad has benefited companies like Caterpillar Inc. as
orders rise and factories spearhead the recovery. A report on
jobless claims today may underscore the Federal Reserve’s view
that the expansion is being restrained as joblessness limits
consumer purchases.  
 “Manufacturing is helping keep the economy moving in the
right direction,” said  Ryan Sweet , a senior economist at
Moody’s Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “Even though
manufacturers will continue to add to payrolls, the labor market
will soften this summer.”  
 The Commerce Department’s durable goods report is due at
8:30 a.m. in Washington. Survey estimates ranged from a drop of
4.5 percent to an increase of 1.2 percent. Projections for
bookings excluding transportation ranged from a decline of 1
percent to a 2 percent gain.  
 Claims Elevated  
 A report from the Labor Department, also due at 8:30 a.m.,
will show that the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits
last week retreated from a one-month high, according to the
survey median. Initial jobless claims fell to 463,000 during the
week, from 472,000, economists said.  
 The Fed yesterday restated a pledge to keep its key
interest rate close to zero, where it’s been since December
2008, to maintain the recovery. In their statement accompanying
the decision, central bankers said the “economic recovery is
proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually.”
Household spending is “constrained by high unemployment.”  
 Some companies are forecasting increased sales as the
global economy recovers.  Caterpillar , the world’s largest maker
of construction equipment, will see revenue rise 25 percent this
year on surging demand for equipment from the mining and energy
industries in developing nations, Chief Executive Officer  James Owens  said this week.  
 “We’re coming back very strongly after the recession,”
Owens told reporters after a conference in Lima. “We’ll see
growth in oil, gas and coal because we need energy for these
rapid-growth emerging countries that are driving the need for
commodities.”  
 Manufacturing Shares  
 Manufacturing shares are outperforming the broader market.
The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Machinery  Index , which
includes Deere & Co. and Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, is
up 8 percent so far this year. The broader S&P 500  Index  is down
2.1 percent on concern the European debt crisis will temper
global growth.  
 U.S. factories face the risk that Europe’s debt crisis will
slow  export  growth at the same time a stronger dollar makes
American goods less competitive. U.S.  exports  fell 0.7 percent
in April after jumping 3.8 percent the previous month, the
Commerce Department reported June 10.  
 A drop in aircraft orders may have dragged down the overall
bookings for durable goods in May for the first time in six
months.  Boeing Co. , the world’s second-biggest commercial-plane
maker, said this month it received 5 aircraft orders in May,
compared with 34 in April and 43 in March. Industry data may not
correlate for the government statistics on a month-to-month
basis.
