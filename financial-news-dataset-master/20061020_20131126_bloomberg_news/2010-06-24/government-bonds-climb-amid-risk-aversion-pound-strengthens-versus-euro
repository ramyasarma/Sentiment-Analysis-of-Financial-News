             U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
the 10-year yield to the lowest level since October, as a drop
in stocks boosted demand for perceived safety and budget cuts
sustained optimism that Britain will keep its top credit rating.  
  Gilts  gained for a fourth straight day in the longest
stretch of advances since May 25. The pound rallied to the
highest level against the euro since November 2008 as Bank of
England minutes showed yesterday that  Andrew Sentance , a policy
maker, wanted an interest-rate increase.  
 “Government bonds are doing well because of general risk
aversion, and gilts are riding on that,” said  Nick Stamenkovic ,
a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Gilts are also supported by improved funding
outlook after spending cuts.”  
 The 10-year gilt  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.4 percent at 2:30 p.m. in London, after
touching 3.38 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 13. 4.75
percent security maturing in March 2020 rose 0.32, or 3.2 pounds
per 1,000-pound ($1,499) face amount, to 111.1. The two-year
yield dropped three basis points to 0.74 percent.  
 Sterling advanced 0.2 percent to 81.12 pence per euro, from
82.30 pence yesterday. It climbed earlier to 81.81 pence, the
first time it traded stronger than 82 pence since Nov. 12, 2008.
The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.4995, from $1.4957.  
 Drop in Equities  
 Stocks  tumbled across Europe today, paced by raw-material
companies, on concern the resignation of Australian Prime
Minister  Kevin Rudd  in favor of  Julia Gillard  may delay a tax
agreement for mining companies. Spanish, Portuguese and Greek
equities slid on lingering concern Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will stall economic recovery.  
 Britain’s stock benchmark, the FTSE 100 Index, slumped 0.6
percent after earlier losing 1.3 percent.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  imposed this
week a bank levy and raised the sales tax while reducing
spending, aiming to keep the debt crisis from spreading to the
U.K. while maintaining the nation’s top credit rating.  
 The pound has gained 3.8 percent against the euro and 1.1
percent against the dollar since the May 6 general election that
ousted the Labour Party. Gilts have outperformed their European
and U.S. counterparts during the same period, giving investors a
2.4 percent return, compared with 1 percent from German bonds
and 1.4 percent for America’s debt.  
 S&P on Rating  
 It’s too early to assess the impact of Britain’s budget on
the nation’s AAA credit rating, said  Moritz Kraemer , head of
sovereign ratings for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Standard
& Poor’s. The company put the U.K.’s rating on negative outlook
in May 2009.  
 “We’ve only seen the budget coming out,” Kraemer said in
an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown.”
“This budget is clearly a very austere budget. At the end of
the day, it’s a question of political will. It’s a question to
what extent the government will be willing to push these things
through.”  
 The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-1 to keep the target
interest rate at 0.5 percent, according to minutes of the June
10 decision released in London today. Sentance made the first
push for an interest-rate increase by a Bank of England policy
maker in almost two years.
