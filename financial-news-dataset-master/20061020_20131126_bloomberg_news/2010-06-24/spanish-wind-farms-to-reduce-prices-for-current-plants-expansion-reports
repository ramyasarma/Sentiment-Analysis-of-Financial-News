             Spanish wind farm operators proposed
price cuts for power generated from their existing generators in
negotiations with the country’s Industry Ministry, Expansion
reported.  
 The wind generators’ lobby group also proposed setting a
limit of 2,300 hour each year for plants to earn the subsidized
prices, the newspaper said, citing a written proposal the group
filed with the government.  
 The newspaper didn’t say by how much the industry planned
to lower its prices.
