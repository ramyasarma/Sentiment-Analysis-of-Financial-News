             China’s stocks fluctuated. Shaanxi
Broadcast & TV Network Intermediary Co. paced gains by media
companies on the prospect of industry consolidation. Commodity
producers fell after U.S. new-home sales sank to a record low.
The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1 percent to 2,567.77 at
1:45 p.m., after changing direction at least six times. About
five stocks fell for every three that rose on the gauge.
