             The number of Americans applying for
 jobless benefits  declined last week from a two-month high,
pointing to an improvement in the labor market that is taking
time to develop.  
 Initial jobless claims decreased by 19,000 to 457,000 in
the week ended June 19, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The number of people  receiving  unemployment
insurance fell, while those getting extended benefits rose.  
 Payrolls have risen every month this year, yet the pace of
private hiring hasn’t been strong enough to spur self-sustaining
gains in consumer spending. The government next week may report
the U.S. lost jobs in June for the first month this year after
the government dismissed temporary census workers, according to
economists’ estimates.  
 “The trend certainly has been towards improvement in the
labor market,” said Jim O’Sullivan, global chief economist at
MF Global Ltd. in New York. “The question is to what extent the
improving momentum has been disrupted by the turmoil in the
markets. It’s possible the labor market has lost a little
momentum.”  
 Companies are showing little concern about boosting
investment in new equipment, figures from the Commerce
Department also showed today. Orders for durable goods  excluding
transportation  rose 0.9 percent in May, the third gain in the
past four months, indicating manufacturing will help maintain
the economic recovery.  
 Stocks Down  
 Stock-index futures trimmed earlier losses after the
reports. The  contract  on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
0.4 percent to 1,083 at 8:53 a.m. in New York, indicating shares
may slip for a fourth day, on concern the European debt crisis
will slow global growth. Treasury securities rose, pushing the
yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 3.09 percent from
3.12 percent late yesterday.  
 Economists forecast jobless applications would fall to
463,000 from an initially reported 472,000 for the prior week,
according to the  median  of 42 projections in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 445,000 to 485,000.  
 Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  
 Average Claims  
 The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, dropped to 462,750 last week from 464,250
the prior week, today’s report showed. That puts it at about the
463,000 claims a week averaged so far this year, indicating
firings have leveled off rather than slowed in 2010.  
 The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
decreased by 45,000 in the week ended June 12 to 4.55 million.  
 The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended or emergency benefits under federal
programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and
are now collecting emergency and extended payments increased by
about 45,000 to 5.3 million in the week ended June 5.  
 The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.5 percent in
the week ended June 12 from 3.6 percent the prior week.  
 Twelve states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 41 reported an increase. These data are also
reported with a one-week lag.  
 Fed Policy  
 Federal Reserve policy makers yesterday reiterated a pledge
to keep the benchmark interest at a record low for an “extended
period” and signaled the fallout from the European debt crisis
poised a risk for economic growth. They acknowledged the labor
market was “improving gradually,” even as employers are
reluctant to boost hiring.  
 The economy lost 8.4 million jobs during the recession that
began in December 2007, the biggest employment slump in the
post-World War II era. From January through May, company
payrolls grew by 495,000 workers. A Labor Department report July
2 may show total payrolls fell in June as census neared
completion, allowing the federal government to cut temporary
jobs associated with the decennial population count.  
 Claims around 450,000 are consistent with private companies
adding about 100,000 jobs a month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief
economist  Bruce Kasman  said in a note to clients before the June
17 report. That is fewer than the 116,000 a month average growth
in the five years to December 2007, when the recession began.  
 Claims and Payrolls  
 Initial claims would have to average 425,000 to 430,000 for
private payrolls to rise by the 175,000 a month that JPMorgan
economists are forecasting for the second half of the year,
Kasman said.  
 Local governments are among employers cutting staff to trim
budget deficits.  
 Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, plans to fire hundreds
of workers and seek concessions from unionized employees to help
close a $180 million budget deficit, Mayor Cory Booker said.  
 “The cost of holding onto the employees we have right now
is growing at a rate that we cannot keep up,” Booker said last
week during his monthly call-in show on a local radio station
WBGO. “There will be hundreds of layoffs and this is something
that is going to be incredibly difficult. This is not the
economy you want to be laid off in.”  
 Manufacturers are leading private hiring. Toyota Motor
Corp. is planning to complete a plant in Blue Springs,
Mississippi, and hire 2,000 workers to begin production of
Corollas by the end of next year, the world’s largest automaker
announced on June 17. The company had mothballed the project 18
months ago as U.S. sales collapsed.  
 At least 2,000 additional jobs with suppliers are likely to
result from the plant project as well, said Mississippi Governor
 Haley Barbour .
