             Former U.K. finance minister
 Alistair Darling  said that if the government showed its spending
plans to the European Commission before presenting them to
Parliament, the details would be revealed early.  
 “It will get leaked,” Darling said at “The Sovereign
Debt Briefing” in London hosted by Bloomberg Link today. “They
wouldn’t sit on a national budget without it coming out. You
wouldn’t have to be hard working,” Darling said to the
journalists in the audience. “You’d just hang around a wine bar
and you’d have it.”  
 To coordinate budgets and avoid a repeat of the Greek debt
crisis, European Union officials have suggested requiring
governments to submit spending plans before allowing parliaments
to vote on them. EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  yesterday  denied 
there had been a proposal that finance ministers submit their
budgets to the Commission “for approval” first.  
 “It is a fundamental part of our constitution that
ministers are responsible to the House of Commons in relation to
finance matters and that’s where the budget will be presented
first of all,” Darling said. “Are you honestly saying the
European Commission will be a better judge than the U.K. finance
minister? I just think the whole thing is misguided.”
