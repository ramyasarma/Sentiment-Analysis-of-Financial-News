             Hasbro Inc. , the world’s second-
biggest toymaker, denied that it’s in discussions regarding a
possible takeover, saying the board spurned an approach from a
private-equity firm.  
 There are currently no talks about the sale of the company,
Hasbro said today in a statement, without identifying the buyout
firm. Providence Equity Partners Inc. was in discussions with
Hasbro as recently as last week before they ended, according to
a person familiar with the matter.  
 Hasbro, the maker of Nerf toys and Monopoly, was  valued  at
about $6 billion as of yesterday, which would have made a deal
the largest leveraged buyout this year. Even the possibility of
a buyout signals that toy companies are trading for less than
they’re worth, said  Chris White , an analyst with Wedbush
Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.  
 “These alleged discussions surrounding Hasbro may be the
catalysts to richer industry valuations,” White said today in a
report.  
 The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Hasbro was in
talks with Providence.  Wayne Charness , a spokesman for
Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro, declined to comment beyond
the statement, while Providence spokeswoman Julie Fisher didn’t
return a phone call seeking comment.  
 Hasbro, which closed at $41.12 yesterday, climbed as high
as $46.60 this morning before early trading was stopped prior to
the announcement. After trading resumed, the  shares  advanced
$1.74, or 4.2 percent, to $42.86 at 4:02 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.  
 Stock Performance  
 Before today, Hasbro’s  shares  had climbed 28 percent this
year, more than twice the pace of larger rival  Mattel Inc. 
Hasbro, which also owns the Transformers and Scrabble brands,
posted an almost threefold increase in net income last quarter
after selling more games and puzzles.  
 “We expect investor attention to quickly turn to Hasbro’s
only large competitor,  Mattel , as a potential takeover
candidate, although we believe Mattel’s size makes a deal less
likely,” said White.  
 Credit-default swaps on Hasbro surged 93 basis points to
230 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. Swaps tied to
Mattel climbed 38 basis points to 175 basis points, according to
CMA, the credit information provider, which said closes at those
levels would be record highs.  
 Credit swaps are a measure of the cost to protect against
losses on company bonds. The swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  
 Other U.S. toy companies are seeking additional investment.
 Toys “R” Us Inc.  said last month that it plans to raise as
much as $800 million in an initial public offering after KKR &
Co., Bain Capital Partners LLC and Vornado Realty Trust took the
company private in 2005 for $7.5 billion.  
 Hasbro has a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 and trades at
7 times its enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Wedbush’s White said, using his
2011 earnings estimates.  
 “It’s an industry that historically has generated very
good free cash flow and it has low capital intensity,” said
Hayley Wolff, an analyst with Rochdale Securities LLC in New
York. “Hasbro has a tremendous arsenal of brands. It’s stuff we
all grew up on and our kids grow up on.”
