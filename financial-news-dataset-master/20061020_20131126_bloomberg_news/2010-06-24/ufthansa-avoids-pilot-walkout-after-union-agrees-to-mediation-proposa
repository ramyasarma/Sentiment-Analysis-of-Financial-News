             Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-largest airline, will avoid a new round of pilot walkouts
after the Vereinigung Cockpit union accepted a mediation
proposal.  
 The German union said the proposal by mediator Klaus von
Dohnanyi accommodates both the desire of the pilots to keep jobs
from being moved abroad as well employee contributions to the
company’s economic future.  Andreas Bartels , a Lufthansa
spokesman, said today by phone that the airline has also agreed
to the proposal, which will ensure strikes won’t be held.  
 The Cologne, Germany-based carrier’s pilots walked off the
job on Feb. 22, wiping out hundreds of flights and costing
Lufthansa about 50 million euros ($62 million), in a dispute
over wages and working conditions. Further strike action was
halted by a court ruling and avoided after the two sides agreed
in April to mediate the dispute.  
 The proposal foresees a freeze on pay increases through
March of next year and all of the pilots’ contributions are
linked to guarantees on existing jobs and growth, the union said
today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Pilots have been seeking a promise that lower-paid crews
from newly acquired carriers won’t be used at the main German
units. Lufthansa aims to cut 1 billion euros from expenses
through 2011 and is seeking 10 percent in cost savings from
cabin crews and pilots.
