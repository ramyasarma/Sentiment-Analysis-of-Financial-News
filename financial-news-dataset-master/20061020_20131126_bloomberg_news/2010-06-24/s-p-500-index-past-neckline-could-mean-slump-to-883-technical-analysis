             The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index is
near a level that, if broken, could lead the U.S. equity
benchmark to a 14-month low, according to BTIG LLC.  
 Should the  S&P 500  fall 3.8 percent from yesterday’s close,
it would complete what analysts who study charts to make
forecasts define as a “head-and-shoulders” pattern. That
occurs after three successive rallies that an index can’t
sustain. The middle peak -- the head -- marks the highest point.
A drop below the “neckline” of 1,050, which passes through the
lowest point of the pattern, could take the benchmark to 883,
according to  Michael O’Rourke , chief market strategist at BTIG.  
 His forecast is derived by subtracting the distance between
the “neckline” and the “head” of 1,219.8, reached intraday
on April 26, from the neckline itself. The “left shoulder”
occurred when the  S&P 500  rose to 1,150.45 on Jan. 19 before
falling to 1,044.50 on Feb. 5. The “potential” right shoulder
is being formed after the S&P 500 fell 3.5 percent from its June
21 intraday peak of 1,131.23 through yesterday, O’Rourke said.  
 “The pattern being formed is far from textbook,” said
Yardley, Pennsylvania-based O’Rourke, whose firm serves
institutional investors. “It lacks symmetry. For an ideal
symmetry, the right shoulder should occur in late July, early
August. This is not my base case, but instead investors should
be on alert in case the pattern completes.”  
 The  S&P 500  dropped for a third day yesterday after the
Federal Reserve signaled that European indebtedness may harm
American growth and new-home sales sank to a record low. The
benchmark has gained 4 percent since June 7 and completed its
biggest two-week rally since November on June 18 as concern
about Europe’s debt crisis eased.  
 Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. The
trading patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
