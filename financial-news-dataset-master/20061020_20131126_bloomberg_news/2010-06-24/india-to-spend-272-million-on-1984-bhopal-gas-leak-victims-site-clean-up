             India will spend more than 12.65
billion rupees ($272 million) to increase compensation for the
victims of a 1984 toxic gas leak at a Union Carbide Corp. plant
in Bhopal, clean up the site and improve medical facilities.  
 The measures will be implemented in a “time bound
manner,”
Information and Broadcasting Minister  Ambika Soni  said after a
cabinet meeting approved the proposal.  
 The Indian government will also seek the extradition of
 Warren Anderson , the former chairman of Union Carbide, from the
U.S., Soni said.  
 An Indian court on June 7 sentenced seven former senior
employees of  Union Carbide ’s local unit to two years each in
jail, more than 25 years after the leak. The quantum of sentence
caused widespread public anger. The opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party has criticized the federal Congress-party led government
for allowing Anderson to leave India.  
 An accident at the Union Carbide pesticide plant on Dec. 3,
1984, released methyl isocyanate gas into the streets of Bhopal,
the capital of Madhya Pradesh state in central India. Union
Carbide estimated that 3,800 people were killed by the leak.
 Amnesty International , a human rights group, commissioned a
study that showed 7,000 perished within days and another 15,000
died later from exposure to the gas.  
 Midland, Michigan-based  Dow Chemical Co. , the world’s
second-largest chemical maker, acquired Union Carbide in 1999.
Dow says all liabilities were settled in a $470 million out-of-
court settlement Union Carbide agreed with the Indian government
in 1989.  
 The Indian government will pursue a “liability case”
against Dow Chemical as part of a new push to give justice to
victims, Soni said.  
 Tomm F. Sprick, a spokesman for Union Carbide, said this
month that the company and its officials are not subject to
jurisdiction of Indian courts since they did not have any
involvement in the operation of the Bhopal plant, which was
owned and operated by Union Carbide India Ltd.
