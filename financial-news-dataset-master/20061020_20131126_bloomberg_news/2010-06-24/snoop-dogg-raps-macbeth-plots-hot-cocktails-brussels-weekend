             A refreshing aperitif and a bit of
dancing are a pleasant way to de-stress in now steamy Brussels.  
 “Les Aperos Urbains”  holds outdoor cocktail parties in a
park or square across the city every Friday evening during the
summer, with music spun by an array of DJs.  
 This week, they’re teaming up with  Bal Moderne , which
holds events where dancers -- often from Anne Teresa De
Keersmaeker’s troupe Rosas -- teach three choreographies to
whoever shows up. The budding Baryshnikovs then join in
performing the works -- tutus or tights are not obligatory.
It’s all free and open to everyone at the Parc du
Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark near the European Commission.  
 (Note in your agenda that the July 4 Apero will be held at
local landmark the Atomium to welcome the Tour de France as it
whizzes into Brussels.) Information:

 After all that exertion, you’ll merit a feast of, say,
grilled squid and lamb in lemon sauce on the sidewalk terrace
at l’Atlantide, a nearby Greek taverna (73, Rue Franklin, tel.
+32-2-736-2002).  
 Saturday  
 The  Wiels  arts center has just opened an exhibition of
works (through Sept. 12) by Wangechi Mutu. The Kenya-born
artist, who lives in New York, is Deutsche Bank AG’s Artist of
the Year for 2010 and the German bank is sponsoring this show.
The core is Mutu’s large installation “My Dirty Little
Heaven,” a mix of cocoon and shanty that aims to reflect the
blurred notion of cultural identity. The show also features her
collages and paintings. Information:  http://www.wiels.org/ .  
 Photojournalist Cedric Gerbehaye is showing a superb
series of pictures from his trips to central Africa in “Congo
in Limbo” at  Le Botanique . The photos, all black and white,
are a stark reflection of a society that’s both violent and
proudly seductive. Information:  http://www.botanique.be/ .  
 Saturday Night  
 Snoop Dogg  may have been banned in the Netherlands but the
U.S. rapper is welcome across the border and will be topping
the bill at  Couleur Cafe , a weekend festival of World Music.
Nigeria’s  Femi Kuti  and Staff Benda Billi, a startling
Congolese rumba band made up of disabled musicians, are also
performing Saturday evening, with a fireworks display around
midnight. The sprawling Tour & Taxis site, a 19th-century
former postal center, will host an array of acts on several
stages, a dance club, an artisan market and a street devoted to
exotic culinary specialties. Information:

 Sunday  
 You’ll have to search for the witches in Krzysztof
Warlikowski’s matinee production of Verdi’s “Macbeth” -- look
up. The Polish director deconstructs Shakespeare’s tale of
power and guilt with ample use of video at  La Monnaie/De Munt .
He’s well served by a cast that includes Scott Hendricks in the
title role and Iano Tamar and Lisa Houben alternating as his
viperous lady.  Paul Daniel  conducts. Information:

 Sunday Night  
 You can mull the consequences of entanglements with highly
ambitious partners over a sumptuous platter of mezze at Kif Kif
(1, Square de Biarritz, tel. +32-2-644-1810), a stylish
mideastern restaurant with a terrace that overlooks a small
lake in the uptown Ixelles district.  
 The triumphantly Art Deco Flagey cultural center across
the lake is hosting the  Brussels European Film Festival  through
June 30. The focus is on young directors, with a selection of
movies from the Sundance Festival in the U.S. too.  
 At 9 p.m., you can catch “I Am Not Your Friend,” a look
at crisscrossed relationships by Hungarian director Gyorgy
Palfi. The free open-air screening (10:30 p.m.) on Sunday is
“Panique au Village,” a zany Belgian road movie by Stephane
Aubier and Vincent Patar. Information:  http://www.fffb.be .
