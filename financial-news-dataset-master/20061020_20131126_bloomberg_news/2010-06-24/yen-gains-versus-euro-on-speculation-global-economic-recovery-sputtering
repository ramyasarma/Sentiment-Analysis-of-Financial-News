             The yen rose toward a two-week high
against the euro on speculation Group of 20 leaders meeting this
weekend will fail to agree on ways to tackle Europe’s debt
crisis, boosting demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 The euro headed for a weekly loss against the dollar as
European countries such as Germany are initiating austerity
plans while the U.S. is calling for a focus on growth.
Australia’s dollar fell for a second day against the greenback
as concern the global recovery is slowing reduced demand for
higher-yielding assets. South Korea’s won weakened for a fourth
day as Asian shares declined.  
 “The G-20 summit may not reach any kind of agreement,”
said  Yuji Saito , director of the foreign-exchange department in
Tokyo at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, a unit
of France’s largest bank by branches. “The apparent conflict
between the U.S. and Europe is not good for the markets. The
bias is for the yen to be bought.”  
 The yen advanced to 110.33 per euro as of 6:48 a.m. in
London from 110.52 in New York yesterday, when it rose to 109.54,
the strongest since June 10. Japan’s currency was at 89.53 per
dollar from 89.61 yesterday, when it climbed to 89.23, the
highest since May 21. It has risen 1.3 percent this week.  
 The euro was at $1.2316 from $1.2333, set for a 0.6 percent
decline this week. Australia’s dollar fell 0.5 percent to 86.23
U.S. cents, extending this week’s decline to 1.1 percent.  
 Stock Losses  
 Japan’s currency strengthened against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts as the  MSCI Asia Pacific  Index of  shares  declined
1.6 percent.  
 G-20 leaders will meet in Toronto on June 26-27 to discuss
policies aimed at addressing Europe’s crisis, spurring global
growth and overhauling financial regulation. Germany and the U.S.
have been at odds on whether to prioritize debt reduction or
stimulus, with Chancellor  Angela Merkel  this week saying
Europe’s debt levels have to be reduced because they are one of
the main causes of the crisis.  
 The G-20 meeting is also expected to discuss proposals for
a global bank levy and a tax on securities transactions to clamp
down on financial speculation.  
 “There’ll probably be some sort of agreement on the bank
tax,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. “That could be poor
for equity markets, so that would be good for safe-haven
currencies like the dollar and the yen.”  
 Australian Dollar  
 Australia’s dollar headed for weekly loss before reports
next week forecast to show economic and consumer confidence in
the U.S. and Europe is waning.  
 An  index  of executive and consumer  sentiment  in the 16 euro
nations slipped to 98.3 this month from 98.4 in May, according
to a Bloomberg survey. Over the same period, the U.S. Conference
Board’s consumer  confidence  index declined to 62.5 from 63.3, a
separate survey showed. Both reports are due June 29.  
 “Risk sentiment is weakening as a number of economic data
points are now showing the global recovery slowing,” said
 Hiroshi Yanagisawa , a Tokyo-based dealer at FX Prime Corp., a
foreign-exchange unit of Japanese trading house Itochu Corp.
“Growth-related currencies such as the Aussie are hostage to
selling pressure.”  
 Won Declines  
 The won extended its losing streak to the most in three
months as overseas investors  reduced  their holdings of the
nation’s stocks.  
 Korea’s currency slid 2.3 percent to 1,217.10 per dollar.
The last time it fell for four days was the period ended March
25. The Kospi index of shares declined 0.7 percent.  
 “The won is reacting to the risk aversion we saw
overnight,” said  Moh Siong Sim , a Singapore-based foreign-
exchange strategist for Bank of Singapore Ltd.  
 Morgan Stanley raised its 2010 and 2011 forecasts for the
pound against the dollar and the euro, citing this week’s U.K.
budget and the likelihood U.K. inflation will quicken.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  unveiled an
emergency budget June 22 that included a levy on banks, a higher
sales tax and spending cuts. The plan, together with measures
proposed by the previous government, will generate 113 billion
pounds ($169 billion) of deficit cuts, 15 percent of the 737
billion-pound budget foreseen for 2015, the Treasury said.  
 “In light of the proactive budget and the higher inflation
profile, we are adjusting our pound forecasts to show a more
neutral outlook,”  Emma Lawson , a London-based currency
strategist at the U.S. bank, wrote in a note yesterday.  
 Morgan Stanley said the pound may trade at $1.43 by the end
of 2010 and $1.52 by the end of 2011, compared with previous
projections of $1.29 and $1.41. The currency may rise to 81
pence per euro by year-end and 77 pence by end 2011, from
earlier estimates of 90 and 83, according to the note.
