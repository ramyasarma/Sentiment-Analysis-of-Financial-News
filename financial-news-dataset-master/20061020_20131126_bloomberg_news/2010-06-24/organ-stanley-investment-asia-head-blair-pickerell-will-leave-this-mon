             Blair Pickerell , Morgan Stanley
Investment Management’s Asia head, will  leave  the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets at the end of this month to pursue other
opportunities, said a company spokesman.  
 The resignation of Hong Kong-based Pickerell, who joined in
June 2007, was announced internally earlier this month, said
 Nick Footitt , a Morgan Stanley spokesman in the city.  
 Pickerell, a fund industry veteran in Hong Kong who headed
the regional investment management arm of  HSBC Holdings Plc 
before his Morgan Stanley stint, couldn’t immediately be reached
for comment. He had also been chairman of JF Funds, a unit of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Pickerell’s pending departure was reported by Hong Kong-
based trade publication Asian Investor earlier today.
