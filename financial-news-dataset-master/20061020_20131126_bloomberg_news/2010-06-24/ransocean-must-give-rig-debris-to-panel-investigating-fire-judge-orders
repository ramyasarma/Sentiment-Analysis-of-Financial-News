             Transocean Ltd.  must comply with a
subpoena from a joint panel of the U.S. Coast Guard and Minerals
Management Service that is investigating the explosion that sank
the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Louisiana coast,
killing 11 and causing the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 U.S. District Judge  Keith Ellison  in Houston today rejected
the request by Transocean, the rig’s owner, to block the panel’s
subpoena, which was approved by a different federal judge in New
Orleans. Ellison is overseeing Transocean’s attempt to limit its
liability related to the sunken rig.  
 Transocean’s lawyers said they feared turning over the
rig’s work logs, records and physical debris would put it in
violation of other court orders and a request by the U.S.
 Justice Department  to preserve and maintain all evidence related
to the disaster.  
 “The court has no intention of standing in the way of a
government investigation,’’ Ellison said in the ruling.  
 The debris, which the company has been accumulating at a
warehouse in coastal Louisiana, includes a 50-foot section of
the marine riser pipe that was cut from the top of the damaged
blowout preventer on the well.  
 Ellison said he wants all physical evidence preserved
intact, as the Deepwater Horizon’s remnants are the asset whose
value may set the upper limit of Transocean’s liability for
claims over damages from the explosion and spill.  
 The  company  asked Ellison to use a 159-year-old maritime
statute to cap its liability at $27 million, the value of the
rig’s unpaid drilling rental fees at the time it exploded and
sank in April.  
 The case is In Re. The Complaint and Petition of Triton
Asset Leasing GmbH, 4:10-cv-01721, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Texas (Houston).
