             Belvedere SA  shares held by Chief
Executive Officer  Jacques Rouvroy  and his deputy  Christophe Trylinski  were seized yesterday by bailiffs in France as part of
a dispute with London investment funds.  
 Shares representing about 15.5 percent of the share capital
of the vodka maker were seized by Maple Leaf Macro Volatility
Master Fund and Astin Capital Management Ltd., Fabrice
Marchisio, a lawyer for the funds, said in a statement. A U.K.
court in 2009 ordered the company to pay at least 7.5 million
euros ($9.24 million) to Maple Leaf for its role in financing
the executives’ efforts to regain control of Belvedere.  
 The executives yesterday applied to a court in Dijon for a
cancellation of the seizure,  Alain Ribeyre,  a lawyer for Rouvroy
and Trylinski, said by phone. Ribeyre said he was confident of
success in halting the action.  
 The seizures included about 7.5 percent of the direct share
capital of Belvedere, as well as two-thirds of the shares in
holding company Financiere du Vignoble, which holds eight
percent of Belvedere, Marchisio said.  
 American actor  Bruce Willis  was granted a 3.3 percent stake
in Belvedere last December as part of an accord for marketing
the Sobieski vodka brand. The company was granted protection
from creditors in July 2008 after violating the terms of its
notes by repurchasing more of its stock than allowed.
