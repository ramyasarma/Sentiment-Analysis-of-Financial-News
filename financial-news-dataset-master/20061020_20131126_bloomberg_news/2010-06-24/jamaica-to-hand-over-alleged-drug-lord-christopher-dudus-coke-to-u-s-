             Jamaica said it will hand over
alleged drug lord Christopher “Dudus” Coke to the U.S., where
he faces narcotics trafficking and weapons charges.  
 Coke “waived his right for an extradition trial in Jamaica
and could be extradited to the United States as early as this
afternoon,” the Jamaican government said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Coke was arrested at a roadside checkpoint yesterday after
a month-long manhunt. At least 74 people, mostly civilians, died
from confrontations between police and Coke supporters during
street clashes in Kingston, the capital.  
 Coke is accused by the U.S. of leading an international
criminal group known as the “Shower Posse,” with members in
Jamaica and the U.S. He is charged with conspiracy to distribute
marijuana and cocaine and conspiracy to illegally traffic in
firearms, according to the office of the  New York Attorney
General .
