             Most Japanese  stocks  dropped as
companies that rely on overseas sales declined after the yen
appreciated and on concern U.S. growth will slow. Real estate
companies rose as bond yields fell, signaling lower loan rates.  
 Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest carmaker that gets
70 percent of its revenue outside Japan, lost 0.8 percent. Sony
Corp., which makes the PlayStation 3 game console and gets 70
percent of its revenue overseas, sank 1.1 percent after U.S.
housing sales slumped more than expected and the Federal Open
Market Committee said the debt crisis in Europe may hurt
economic growth. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co., Japan’s
third-biggest developer by market value, gained 2.9 percent.  
 “Judging from the U.S. housing-sales figures, it’s hard to
expect the economy will continue to recover strongly,” said
 Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $94 billion.  
 The  Topix  index lost 0.1 percent to 879.77 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo, falling for three consecutive days. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.1 percent to 9,928.34. About
eight stocks declined for every seven that rose.  
 The Topix has lost 3.1 percent this year, compared with a
drop of 2.1 percent by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and a
gain of 0.2 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 17 times estimated  earnings ,
compared with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.8 times for the
Stoxx.  
 U.S. Housing Sales  
 Toyota sank 0.8 percent to 3,195 yen and was the second-
biggest contributor to the Topix’s decline. Sony lost 1.1
percent to 2,493 yen, the lowest since Dec. 10. Nissan Motor Co.,
a carmaker that counts North America as its biggest market,
retreated 1.2 percent to 658 yen.  
 In New York yesterday, the S&P index declined 0.3 percent
after a U.S. Commerce Department report showed purchases of new
homes fell in May to a record low as a tax credit expired. Sales
collapsed 33 percent to an annual pace of 300,000 last month
from April, less than the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News and the fewest in data going back to 1963.  
 “The drop in new home sales in the U.S. showed the
economic recovery is not yet self-sustaining,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Sentiment may worsen further.”  
 Dollar Weakens  
 The yen strengthened to as high as 89.79 against the dollar,
compared with 90.42 at yesterday’s market close. The stronger
yen reduces income when overseas revenue is converted into local
currency.  
 “Financial conditions have become less supportive of
economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments
abroad,” the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said in a
statement yesterday in Washington.  
 Nissha Printing Co. retreated 3.2 percent to 2,484 yen. The
maker of film for screens used in mobile phones had its stock
price estimate reduced to 2,200 yen from 3,300 yen by  Yoshihito Hasegawa , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co., who maintained an “underperform” rating.  
 A gauge of real estate companies had the biggest gain among
the 33 industry groups on the Topix. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co., Japan’s third biggest developer by market value,
jumped 2.9 percent to 1,672, the most in the Nikkei. Mitsubishi
Estate Co., Japan’s biggest developer by market value, increased
0.8 percent to 1,348 yen while Mitsui Fudosan Co., the second-
biggest, climbed 1.6 percent to 1,371 yen.  
 Bond Yields Fall  
 “Real-estate companies, whose profits are sensitive to
changes in interest rates, are the targets of bargain hunting,
on expectations capital procurement costs and the burden of debt
repayments will decrease,” said  Yumi Nishimura , an equity-
market analyst at Daiwa Securities SMBC Co.  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 fell to
1.14 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 18, 2003.  
 Suncity Co. surged for a second day, rising 20 percent to
4,145 yen, the highest close since September 2008. The
condominium developer said it expects to book about a 1.8
billion yen gain after a creditor agreed to forgive part of its
debts.  
 Softbank Corp., Japan’s exclusive supplier of Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, jumped 2.8 percent to 2,503 yen, the highest since
December 2007, as the device’s latest model went on sale today.
