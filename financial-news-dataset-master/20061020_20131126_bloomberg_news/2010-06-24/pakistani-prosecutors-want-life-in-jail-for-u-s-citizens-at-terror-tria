             Pakistani prosecutors will push for
five Americans charged with terrorism offenses to be sent to
jail for life if they are found guilty today.  
 “We hope the sentence is the maximum, which is life
imprisonment,” Nadeem Akram Cheema, prosecuting for the
Pakistani government at the court in eastern Punjab province,
said in a telephone interview today. “There is no death
sentence in such cases.”  
 The U.S. citizens, aged 19 to 25 at the time of their
arrest, have been on trial since being detained in December on
charges they sought terrorist training from Taliban guerrillas
in militant strongholds near the border with Afghanistan.  
 The five men deny they were in Pakistan to meet militants
and said they had travelled to attend a wedding. Two are of
Pakistani descent, two of Ethiopian origin and one of Egyptian
background. All are friends from the northern Virginia suburbs
of Washington D.C.
