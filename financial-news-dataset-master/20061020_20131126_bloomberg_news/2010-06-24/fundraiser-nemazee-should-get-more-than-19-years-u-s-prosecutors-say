             Hassan Nemazee, a top political
fundraiser for U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton, should get more than 19 years in prison
for his conviction on bank fraud charges, U.S. prosecutors said.  
 Nemazee pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan in
March to defrauding Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank
of America Corp. out of millions of dollars in March. After he
was arrested in August, prosecutors said he cheated the banks
out of $292 million. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 30.
