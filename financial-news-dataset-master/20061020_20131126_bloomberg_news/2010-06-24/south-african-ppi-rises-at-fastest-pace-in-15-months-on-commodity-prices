             The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at the fastest pace in 15
months in May, following a pick-up in fuel and food prices.  
 Producer-price  inflation accelerated to an annual 6.8
percent from 5.5 percent in April, Pretoria-based  Statistics
South Africa  said on its website today. The  median estimate  of
20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.2 percent. Prices rose
0.2 percent in the month.  
 “Higher commodity prices, which contribute roughly 20
percent to the PPI basket, are the main driver of producer
inflation,”  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Johannesburg-
based Nedbank Ltd, South Africa’s third-largest bank, said in e-
mailed comments. “Slower global growth and weaker demand from
China should contain commodity price gains during the remainder
of the year.”  
 South Africa’s producer-price inflation has accelerated
every month since December as commodity prices rallied and the
economy returned to growth following the first recession in 17
years. Oil rose to a 19-month high of $87.15 a barrel on May 3.  
 The price of imported goods rose 6.5 percent in May from a
year ago, while the price of exported goods increased 4.8
percent, the statistics office said.  
 Market Reaction  
 The rand traded at 7.6161 per dollar as of 11:47 a.m. in
Johannesburg, down from 7.5739 before the release of the data
and 7.5509 late yesterday. Government bonds maintained losses,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
dropping 10 cents to 123.22 rand, for a third straight day of
declines. The yield increased 2 basis points to 7.96 percent.  
 The consumer-price  inflation  rate slowed for a fifth
consecutive month in May, reaching 4.6 percent, the statistics
office reported yesterday. Consumer inflation has remained
within the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target band for
the past four months.  
 The central bank has cut its benchmark rate seven times
since December 2008, lowering it to 6.5 percent. The bank’s
monetary policy committee will make its next interest rate
decision on July 22.  
 “Today’s PPI figure does not alter our view that rates
will remain unchanged until the third quarter of 2011,”
Altenkirch said. “However, a negative growth surprise combined
with the current favorable inflation outlook could still prompt
the Reserve Bank to loosen monetary policy further.”
