             Joseph Nacchio , the former chief of
 Qwest Communications International Inc.  convicted of insider
trading, appealed the 70-month prison sentence that reduced his
original term by two months.  
 U.S. District Judge  Marcia Krieger  in Denver issued the
ruling last month after a federal appeals court ordered that
Nacchio be resentenced because a trial judge incorrectly
calculated his gains from stock sales. He has served almost 15
months in prison.  
 Nacchio, 61, of Rumson, New Jersey, was convicted in 2007
for illegally selling $52 million of stock in Denver-based Qwest
in 2001 based on inside information. In her resentencing ruling,
Krieger upheld a $19 million fine -- the maximum Nacchio faced
-- and approved forfeiture of $44.6 million, a figure that
Nacchio and the government had agreed on.  
 In hearings last month, Nacchio’s lawyer,  Sean Berkowitz ,
suggested that a sentence of 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 years would be
adequate. He objected to the $19 million fine, saying
“something in the several million dollar category” would be
enough. Berkowitz declined to comment today on Nacchio’s appeal.  
 The U.S. argued Nacchio’s illegal gains came to more than
$32 million, warranting the $19 million fine and a prison
sentence ranging from five years and three months to 6 1/2
years.  
 Krieger, who didn’t preside over the original trial, heard
from experts for the government and Nacchio who performed
“event studies” intended to determine the amount Nacchio made
from inside information by measuring how investors reacted to
certain disclosures on particular days.  
 Jeffrey Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s
office in Denver, declined to comment.  
 The case is U.S. v. Nacchio, 1:05-cr-00545, U.S. District
Court, District of Colorado (Denver).
