             Photon Group Ltd. plans to raise as
much as A$200 million through a rights issue as it prepares to
take write-downs on its online business, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column. The capital
raising will be managed by UBS AG and Macquarie Group Ltd. with
the proceeds to be used to cut debt, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.
