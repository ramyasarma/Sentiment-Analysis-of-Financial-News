             Bharti Airtel Ltd., the Indian
mobile-phone company that earlier this month completed a $9
billion acquisition of Zain’s African assets, said it plans to
invest $150 million in Zambia over the next three years.  
 Bharti, which bought 80 percent of Zain Zambia, will invest
the money in expanding the company’s network in the country,
Manoj Kohli, the chief executive officer of Bharti’s African
unit, told reporters in Lusaka today. The company anticipates an
increase in Zain Zambia’s 3 million customers, he said.
