             UralSib Financial Corp. more than
halved its forecast for Russian initial public offerings this
year to $10 billion, citing “tough” market conditions.  
 “New equity issuance has been at a much lower level than
expected,” Chris Weafer, UralSib’s chief strategist, said in a
phone interview yesterday. “Most companies will wait for better
market valuations next year.” Weafer earlier estimated
companies would sell $20 billion to $25 billion of shares in
2010.  
 At least 20 companies around the world postponed or
withdrew IPOs in May as concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
spread spooked investors. Three Russian sales were cancelled:
Deripaska’s Strikeforce Mining & Resources Plc had sought a
listing in Hong Kong, sugar producer OAO Rusagro planned a sale
in Moscow and fertilizer maker OAO UralChem had targeted London.  
 OAO Siberian Coal Energy Co., Russia’s largest producer of
coal for power stations, last week postponed its IPO at least
until the fall as markets slumped. Four Russian IPOs have taken
place so far this year, raising a total of $2.85 billion,
UralSib said in a report today.
