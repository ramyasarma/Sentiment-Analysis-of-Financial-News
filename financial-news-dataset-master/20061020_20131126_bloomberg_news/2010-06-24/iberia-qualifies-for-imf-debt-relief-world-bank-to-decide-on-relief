             Liberia has reached the point where
it qualifies for debt relief from the International Monetary
Fund and a decision on whether to implement that relief is
contingent on the World Bank reaching a “similar decision” at
a meeting on June 29, the IMF said in a statement on its website
yesterday.  
 Liberia also qualified for a $6.55 million disbursement
from the IMF.
