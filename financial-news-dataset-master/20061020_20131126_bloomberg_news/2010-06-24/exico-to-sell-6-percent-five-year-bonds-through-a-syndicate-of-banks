             Mexico’s government plans to sell 20
billion pesos ($1.6 billion) of bonds due in 2015 through a
syndicate of banks during the third quarter, the third such
auction this year, as it seeks to lure investment from abroad.  
 The government will offer at least 15 billion pesos of
debt,  Gerardo Rodriguez , head of the finance ministry’s public
debt unit, said in a conference call today. Mexico will increase
the amount of 10-year, 20-year and 30-year bonds it auctions in
the third quarter, the finance ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 The government will reduce sales of Cetes and five-year
Bondes D, the statement said. Petroleos Mexicanos may sell as
much as 15 billion pesos ($1.18 billion) of bonds in the third
quarter, the ministry said. The government expects to sell at
least 15 billion pesos of the five-year bonds, Rodriguez said.  
 Selling bonds through a syndicate “has proved to be quite
successful,”  Gabriel Casillas , chief Mexico economist for JP
Morgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients before the finance
ministry’s announcement.  
 Mexico’s benchmark peso bond has rallied this year as
inflation has slowed to within the central bank’s target range
and Citigroup Inc. said it would include Mexican peso bonds in
its World Government Bond Index in October.  
 Annual inflation slowed to 3.72 percent in the first half
of June, the lowest level since December and within the bank’s
target rate of 2 percent to 4 percent.  
 Mexico sold 10-year and 30-year bonds through a syndicate
of banks in the first quarter, the first syndicated sale ever by
the government.  
 The yields on the benchmark 10 percent bonds due in 2024
have fallen more than 100 basis points this year to 7.23
percent.  
 Mexico plans to swap bonds on July 21 and Sept. 29,
Rodriguez said. The bonds that will be exchanged will be
announced two days before the swaps, he said.
