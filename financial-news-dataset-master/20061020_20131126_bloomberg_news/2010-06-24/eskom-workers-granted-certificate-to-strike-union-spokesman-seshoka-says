             Workers at Eskom Holdings Ltd.,
South Africa’s state-owned power utility, have been granted a
certificate to strike, National Union of Mineworkers spokesman
Lesiba Seshoka said.  
 The Johannesburg-based electricity company hasn’t increased
its wage offer to workers, Seshoka said by phone today, without
saying when the strike will start.
