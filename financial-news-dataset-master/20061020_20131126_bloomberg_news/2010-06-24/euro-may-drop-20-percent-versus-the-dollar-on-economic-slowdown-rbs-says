             The euro may weaken 20 percent
against the dollar as the region’s efforts to reduce debt erode
economic  growth  and fuel deflationary pressure, according to
RBS Securities Japan Ltd.  
 Europe’s measures to restore fiscal health may “curb
growth in gross domestic product and bring deflation debates to
light,”  Junko Nishioka , chief economist at RBS in Tokyo, said
in a forum yesterday. The euro is still expensive against the
dollar judging by the difference in interest rates and
inflation, and “we can’t say the euro is cheap even if it
falls another 20 percent,” she said.  
 The euro has dropped 14 percent this year, the worst
performance of the 16 major currencies versus the dollar, on
concern the fiscal crisis that originated in Greece will spread
to other debt-laden nations in the region. The euro fell to
$1.1877 on June 7, the weakest since March 2006. It traded at
$1.2338 at 1:27 p.m. in Tokyo, from $1.2311 yesterday.  
 A weaker euro may eventually help revive the region’s
growth, Nishioka said. A 10 percent decline in the currency
will boost economic growth by 1.7 percentage point and push up 
inflation by 1 percentage point over three years, she said. 
Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro-area economy, 
will eventually lead the region out of its crisis, she said.  
 The euro-region economy will expand 1.2 percent this year
and 1.3 percent in 2011, compared with 3.4 percent and 4.3
percent for the U.S. and 3.2 percent and 1.8 percent for Japan,
according to forecasts by RBS.
