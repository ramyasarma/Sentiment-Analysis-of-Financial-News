             Japanese and Australian  stock 
futures fell after U.S. companies forecast earnings that
disappointed some investors and the cost to protect from a Greek
default climbed to a record.  
 American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a camera maker
that gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, tumbled
2.8 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after Bed Bath
& Beyond Inc. missed earnings estimates. Those of Advantest
Corp., the world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, lost
2.6 percent after Dell Inc.’s profit forecast disappointed some
investors. ADRs of Alumina Ltd., an Australian producer of the
material used to make aluminum, sank 2.3 percent.  
 “The U.S. economy has begun to see signs of fragility at
the company level,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist in Tokyo at Tachibana Securities Co. “Companies that
rely on overseas sales will likely be the focus of selling.”  
 Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,755 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,920 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,760 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index lost 0.6 percent in Wellington.  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
dropped 1.7 percent, led by consumer shares and as banks dropped
on concern over financial regulation.  
 U.S. Senate negotiators offered changes to the regulatory-
overhaul bill that would strengthen language banning proprietary
trading at U.S. banks while giving them some leeway to invest in
hedge funds and private-equity funds.  
 Disappointing Profit Outlook  
 Dell, the world’s third-largest maker of personal computers,
fell the most in the S&P 500 as the company said this week it
expects fiscal 2011 revenue to increase to between $60.31
billion and $62.95 billion, compared with an estimate of $61.79
billion by analysts.  
 Bed Bath & Beyond, a retailer of home-furnishings,
retreated 5.6 percent yesterday after forecasting second-quarter
earnings of no more than 63 cents a share. Analysts estimated
earnings of 64 cents on average.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has declined 2.8 percent in
2010, compared with drops of 3.7 percent by the  S&P 500  and 1.6
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.6 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.2 times for the S&P 500 and 11.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 Credit-default swaps on Greece rose 38 basis points
yesterday to an all-time high of 970 basis points, according to
