             Former U.S. Treasury Secretary  Henry Paulson  surprised his British counterpart by the “unfortunate”
decision to let  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  collapse, former
U.K. finance minister  Alistair Darling  said.  
 “I was surprised when  Hank Paulson  told me they were going
to let it go,” Darling, who was chancellor of the exchequer
from June 2007 until May this year, said at “The Sovereign Debt
Briefing” in London hosted by Bloomberg Link today. “I just
didn’t think they would do it.”  
 Darling’s remarks provide a further insight into the lack
of communication between U.K. and U.S. officials who were
scrambling to prevent the investment-bank collapse that
exacerbated the financial crisis in September 2008. Paulson said
afterwards that “the British screwed us” when Darling blocked
the rescue he had engineered, of Barclays Plc buying Lehman.  
 “As is now known, I expressed reservations about a British
bank taking over Lehman because I thought the British taxpayers
might have something to say about underwriting an entire
American bank,” Darling said.  
 John Gieve , the Bank of England’s financial stability chief
at the time, said last year he was also left “alarmed and
surprised” at the denouement of Lehman because the rescue of
Bear Stearns Cos. had created a “strong presumption” that U.S.
officials would save investment banks. Gieve said that he
“didn’t get a lot of news” during the rescue talks.  
 ‘It Was Unfortunate’  
 Lehman announced on Sept. 15, 2008, it had filed for
bankruptcy after a weekend of negotiations at the New York
Federal Reserve with Paulson and the heads of as many as 14
financial institutions.  
 Darling said today that he understood why Paulson didn’t
feel able to backstop Lehman and prevent its bankruptcy after
the Barclays deal fell through.  
 “The problem was that the then Republican administration
didn’t think it could deal with it,” Darling said. “When you
look at the trouble they had over TARP at the time, I can see
why they did it. I think it was unfortunate.”  
 Lehman was the culmination of a series of rescues that left
officials in President  George W. Bush ’s administration unable to
stomach further bailouts, Darling suggested.  
 “Remember it had to underwrite Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
you had Bear Stearns,” he said. “The then U.S. government had
used up all the political capital it thought it had.”
