             Dubai shares declined to the lowest
in a week on concern that the European debt crisis and a slump
in U.S. home sales will weigh on the global economic recovery.  
 Emaar Properties PJSC , builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, fell 2.1 percent and  Deyaar Development  slid for a
third day this week. In Abu Dhabi,  Aabar Investments PJSC  lost
the most in almost three weeks after it bought a stake in
Italy’s UniCredit SpA. The  DFM General Index  decreased 0.8
percent to 1,538.98, trimming its gain for the week to 2.6
percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  declined 0.2 percent.  
 “There’s more of a hangover” from global markets, said
 Akram Annous , deputy fund manager at Al Mal Capital PSC in
Dubai. “There is no real catalyst in the market.”  
 Emerging market stocks fell, with the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index  retreating 0.4 percent at 3:11 p.m. in Dubai. National
benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western European
markets, except Iceland. A U.S. Commerce Department report
yesterday showed purchases of new homes fell in May to a record
low as a tax credit expired.  
 Crude oil for August delivery slid as much as 1.1 percent
to $75.55 a barrel. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 Aabar’s Purchase  
 Emaar dropped to 3.26 dirhams, the lowest level in a week.
Deyaar development retreated 1.2 percent to 34.5 fils after
gaining 14 percent yesterday.  
 Aabar, the Abu Dhabi-based company that is the largest
shareholder in Daimler AG, decreased 3.4 percent to 1.7 dirhams.
The company bought a 4.99 percent stake in UniCredit valued at
about 1.84 billion euros ($2.3 billion), based on yesterday’s
closing price.  
 “The financial services sector is something we are
interested in,” Aabar’s Chief Executive Officer  Mohamed Badawy Al-Husseiny  said in a phone interview today from Abu Dhabi after
confirming the purchase of the stake in Italy’s biggest bank.  
 Bahrain’s  gauge  lost 0.2 percent and Kuwait’s benchmark
fell 0.4 percent, the most since June 14. Abu Dhabi’s  measure 
and Oman’s  MSM30 Index  gained 0.1 percent. Qatar’s benchmark
advanced 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed for the
weekend.
