             Uruguay’s central bank will probably
maintain its  overnight lending rate  at 6.25 percent today on
expectations that inflation will slow to within target and that
the government will continue seeking a weaker peso.  
 The bank’s three-member policy committee will decide for a
second time to hold the rate, which it cut from 8 percent in
December and maintained at its March meeting, according to the
median estimate of 20 economists surveyed by the political
weekly Busqueda. The board, led by bank President  Mario Bergara ,
is due to announce its decision after 4 p.m. New York time.  
 After its last meeting on March 26, the board said the
decision not to change the rate “shouldn’t minimize concerns
regarding  inflationary risks  caused by faster external inflation
and higher-than-forecast economic growth.” Deputy Economy
Minister Pedro Buonomo signaled June 11 that the government
wants the peso to weaken to “between 21 and 22” to the dollar.  
 “We will take all the necessary measures to have it at that
equilibrium point,” Buonomo said.  
 The Uruguayan peso has strengthened 13.9 percent over the
past year, the second-most among seven major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The peso fell 0.6 percent to
20.9725 at 7:50 a.m. New York time after peaking at 18.89 per
dollar on May 17.  
 Uruguay’s $34 billion economy grew 8.9 percent in the first
three months of this year from the same quarter of 2009, the
central bank reported on June 15. In the whole of 2009, the
economy expanded 2.9 percent, its seventh straight year of
growth, bank data show.  
 Above Target  
 Prices rose by 7.09 percent in May from a year earlier
compared with a 7.35 percent year-on-year increase in April,
according to the national statistics institute. The central bank
has an inflation target of 3 percent to 7 percent for 2010.  
 Prices will rise by 6.4 percent this year, according to the
median estimate of 27 analysts who took part in a central bank
survey published on June 14.  
 Bergara told reporters on June 16 that the economy wasn’t
overheating. If there were clear signs of that happening,
monetary and fiscal measures would be taken, he said.  
 The central bank should be more aggressive to slow price
increases, said Ramon Pampin, an economist at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Montevideo.  
 “The economy is heating up and the central bank must tend
to inflation,” Pampin said in a June 15 phone interview.
