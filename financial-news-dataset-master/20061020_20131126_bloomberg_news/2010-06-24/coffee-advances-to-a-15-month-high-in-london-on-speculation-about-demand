             Arabica-coffee prices soared to a
12-year high amid dwindling U.S. inventories and limited
premium-bean supplies. Robusta futures rose to a 15-month high.  
 Stockpiles  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have dropped 27
percent this year to the lowest level since September 2002. Two
consecutive poor harvests in Central America and Colombia and
rain damage last year in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer,
reduced export supplies of high-quality arabica,  Kona Haque , an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, said in a report.  
 “Because of this production shortfall, a lot of these
producers are just holding onto coffee,” said  Fain Shaffer , the
president of Infinitytrading.com, a broker in Medford, Oregon.
“Stocks in New York have been dwindling. It’s a quality
issue.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 8.25 cents, or
5.1 percent, to $1.6875 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $1.765, the highest level since
February 1998.  
 Total estimated volume today was 27,391 contracts. On June
11, ICE reported  record  volume of 110,952.  
 Robusta futures for September delivery climbed $69, or 4.4
percent, to $1,649 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in London.
Earlier, the price climbed to $1,694, the highest level since
March 2009.  
 Demand for both varieties “remains unwaveringly steady,
despite the economic downturn,” Haque of Macquarie said.  
 Arabica coffee is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee and espresso, are harvested mostly in
Asia and parts of Africa.  
 Arabica had the top gain today among 19 raw materials in
the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index. This year, the price has
climbed 24 percent, the second-biggest increase in index
components. Hogs have advanced 27 percent.  
 Robusta is up 27 percent this year. Vietnam is the biggest
producer of the grade.
