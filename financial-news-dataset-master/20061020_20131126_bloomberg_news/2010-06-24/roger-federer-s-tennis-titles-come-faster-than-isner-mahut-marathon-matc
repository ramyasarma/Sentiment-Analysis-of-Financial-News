             John Isner  and  Nicolas Mahut  grabbed
several places in the tennis record books with the longest match
in history, one that took more time than the last three
Wimbledon championships won by  Roger Federer  combined.  
 Isner, of the U.S., needed 11 hours, 5 minutes to beat
Mahut, of France, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 70-68 in a first-round
match at Wimbledon that stretched over three days. Isner, 25, is
19th in the ATP Tour’s  world rankings , while the 28-year-old
Mahut is ranked 148th.  
 The time of the fifth set alone was 8 hours, 11 minutes,
eclipsing the duration of tennis’s longest previous full match
by 1 hour, 38 minutes.  
 Federer was on court a combined six minutes less in winning
his last three Wimbledon titles in a time of 10:59, with two of
those championship matches going to five sets.  
 The 183 total games played by Isner and Mahut are 16 more
than the combined total in the previous three Wimbledon finals,
won by Federer in 2007 and 2009 and  Rafael Nadal  in 2008.
