             Tanzania’s economy will probably
expand 6.2 percent this year, from 5.5 percent in 2009, helped
by increased government spending to boost agricultural output
and build infrastructure, the International Monetary Fund said.  
 Economic growth in the East African nation may accelerate
to 6.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2012, the Washington-
based lender said in a  statement  on its website yesterday.  
 Inflation is projected to slow to 5 percent by the end of
June 2011 and remain stable thanks to lower food prices, the IMF
said. Tanzania’s food production exceeded demand this year, with
farmers harvesting 12.8 million metric tons of crops compared
with national consumption of 11.4 million tons, Stephen Wasira,
the agriculture minister, said on June 23.  
 The inflation rate in Tanzania fell to 7.9 percent in May
from 9.4 percent a month earlier, Finance Minister  Mustafa Mkulo 
said on June 10.
