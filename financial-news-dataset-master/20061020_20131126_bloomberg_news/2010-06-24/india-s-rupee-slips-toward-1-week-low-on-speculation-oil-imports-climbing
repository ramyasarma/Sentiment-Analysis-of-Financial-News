             India’s rupee dropped, nearing a
one-week low, on speculation higher crude oil prices are
boosting the nation’s import bill.  
 Local refiners may have stepped up purchases of the
greenback to pay for crude oil after the cost of the fuel rose
about 9 percent in the past month. India imports almost three-
quarters of the oil it uses and the cost of these  purchases 
reached a 19-month high of $8.08 billion in April, official
figures show.  
 “The rupee is showing a mild weakening bias today, mainly
due to increased dollar demand from oil companies before the end
of the month,” said  Jaiprakash Israni , a currency trader in
Mumbai at state-owned Andhra Bank.  
 The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 46.2725 per dollar as of
10:24 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It yesterday reached 46.36, the weakest level since June 17. The
currency has lost 2.8 percent this quarter, a loss second only
to South Korea’s won among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 46.75 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 46.68 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.
