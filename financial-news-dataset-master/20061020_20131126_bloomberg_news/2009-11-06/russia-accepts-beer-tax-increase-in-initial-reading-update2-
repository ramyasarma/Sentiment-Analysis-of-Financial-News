             Russian lawmakers accepted a bill
that may triple the excise tax on beer next year in the first of
three readings.  
 The  draft law  would raise the tax on beer with an alcohol
content of 0.5 percent to 9 percent over the next three years,
the lower house of  parliament  said in a statement on its Web
site today. The tax would increase next year to 9 rubles a liter
from 3 rubles, followed by an 11 percent increase in 2011 and a
20 percent increase in 2012, according to the draft.  
 The proposed tax increase “is bad news,”  Heineken NV (HEIA) 
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer told investors
at a meeting in Amsterdam today. “It’s a fierce increase at
once. Will it have an impact on consumption and volume? Yes.”  
 Heineken is Russia’s third-largest beer maker, after
 Anheuser-Busch Inbev NV (ABI)  and  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA) , which owns the
country’s largest brewer.  
 “Everybody is already thinking about what they can do,
including us,” van Boxmeer said.  
 The Russian government predicts that the tax increases
would average out to 50 percent over three years.
