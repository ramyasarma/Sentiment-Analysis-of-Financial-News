             Vector Hospitality Plc, a U.K. hotel
owner,  PIK Group (PIKK2) , a Russian apartment builder, and  Realia Business
SA (RLIA) , a Spanish developer, announced plans today to raise as much as
$8.8 billion in the three biggest initial public offerings by
European property companies.  
 Vector is seeking as much as 2.5 billion pounds ($4.94
billion) and will use the money to buy 71 hotels, it said in a
statement today. PIK wants to raise up to $2.2 billion to help
finance construction of apartments and offices with 10 million
square meters of space. Realia's owners are looking for as much as
1.28 billion euros ($1.73 billion) to fund acquisitions.  
 The sales announced today almost match the $9 billion raised
in all of 2006 by European property companies, Bloomberg data
shows. Real estate stocks in  Europe  have gained 27 percent in the
past year, based on the Bloomberg Europe Real Estate Index,
compared with the 24 percent gain by the Dow Jones Stoxx Index.  
 ``There is an appetite for new issuance at the moment,'' said
Ben Ritchie, who helps oversee more than $6 billion of stocks at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, including real estate equities.
``These IPOs will attract slightly different types of investors.''  
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany 's largest bank, is helping manage
the sales for both Vector and PIK. PIK also hired  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
and Nomura International, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  UBS
AG (UBSN)  are helping to manage Vector's IPO. Realia hired  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and Caja Madrid.  
 The largest European real estate IPO until this month was in
1999, when Canary Wharf Group Plc raised 551 million pounds.  
 Vector's Sale  
 AFI Development Plc (AFID) , a Russian property company controlled by
Israeli diamond billionaire  Lev Leviev , raised $1.4 billion in its
IPO on May 3.  
 There is $5 of cash chasing every $1 of real estate
investment, according to Tony Horrell, chief executive officer of
Jones Lang Lasalle Inc's international capital group.  
 Vector is buying the hotels, which are valued at 2.6 billion
pounds, from Royal Bank of  Scotland  Group Plc and two companies
run by Richard Balfour-Lynn, who led the buyout of De Vere Group
Plc last year. They are managed by Hilton Hotels Corp., Marriott
International Inc. and six other companies.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS Plc, a partner with Balfour-Lynn
in one of his companies, and management will invest 140 million
pounds in the IPO, the statement said.  
 Vector plans to take advantage of new U.K. rules and become a
real estate investment trust as soon as practicable after buying
the hotels. It will have to pay a one-time conversion charge of 52
million pounds in return for paying at least 90 percent of its
taxable income in dividends and being exempt from corporate and
capital taxes.  
 Hotel Rooms  
 It will own hotels with a total of 10,781 rooms that are run
by companies such as Thistle Hotels Ltd. and Rezidor Hotel Group
AB as well as Hilton and Marriott. The hotels will include four
that are in or close to  London : the Cumberland, the Park Inn
Heathrow, the Victoria and Albert and the Waldorf Hilton.  
 It also agreed to buy another seven hotels valued at 113
million pounds once they are completed.  
 The 200 million shares being sold at between 995 pence and
1,115 pence each are due to start trading on June 11 and the
offering may be increased by as much as 10 percent, Vector said.  
 Realia's owners, Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA,
 Spain 's third-biggest construction company, which owns 49 percent,
and Spanish savings bank Caja  Madrid , the other major shareholder,
are selling as much as 48 percent of the developer.  
 European Acquisitions  
 Realia, which has operations in Spain, France, Portugal and
 Poland , will look for acquisitions in Europe once the sale is
completed, Chairman Ignacio Bayon said in an interview.  
 PIK's stock offering, in a range of $25 to $31 a share, would
value the Moscow-based company at as much as $14.1 billion, making
it Russia's biggest property company by market value. The
developer will offer new and existing shares and list them in
Moscow and London.  
 Russian developers, excluding PIK, have raised about $4
billion via share sales in the last six months as a nine-year
economic boom drives demand for modern office space and housing.  
 ``Demand remains very strong for real estate and there is
still a scarcity of supply,'' said Kim Iskyan, an analyst at
UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow. ``Companies have a lot in the
pipeline and they need cash to realize them. This is just the
beginning.''
