             The following events and economic
reports may influence trading in Latin American local bonds and
currencies today. Bond yields and exchange rates are from the
previous day's session.  
 Mexico: Consumer confidence rose to 82 in March, from 80.6
a month earlier, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The national statistics agency
is slated to release its consumer sentiment index report at 10
a.m. New York time.  
 Mexican economists raised their 2010 growth forecasts for
the fourth straight month, as a rebound in exports and
accelerating domestic demand help Latin America's second-largest
economy recover from its worst slump since 1932. Gross domestic
product will expand 4.1 percent this year, according to the
median estimate in a central bank survey of 32 analysts
published yesterday. That's up from 3.9 percent estimated in a
survey published March 1, and 2.93 percent in November.  
 Inflation forecasts rose for the second straight month,
with analysts expecting consumer prices to rise 5.28 percent
this year compared to a previous 5.21 percent estimate.  
 The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to 12.2672 per dollar.  
 The yield on Mexico's 10 percent bond due December 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.91
percent, according to Banco Santander SA.  
 Chile: The Feb. 27 earthquake may have created a "blind
spot" that will make it more difficult for policy makers to
decide how to adjust interest rates this year, according to the
minutes published yesterday of the central bank's March monetary
policy meeting. The magnitude 8.8 quake already has hurt
economic growth. South America's fifth-biggest economy expanded
2.7 percent in February from a year earlier, the central bank
said yesterday in a separate report. Economists had expected a
4.5 percent expansion, according to the median of 16 forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The peso gained 0.5 percent to 519.08 per dollar.  
 The yield for a basket of Chile's 10-year peso bonds in
inflation-linked currency units, called unidades de fomento,
rose one basis point to 3.14 percent, according to Bloomberg
composite prices.  
 Other prices in Latin American markets:  
 Argentina: The peso was little changed at 3.8796 per
dollar.  
 The yield on the country's dollar bonds due in 2015 fell 28
basis points to 10.94 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Brazil: The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7631 per dollar.  
 The yield on the zero-coupon, real-denominated bond due in
January 2011 was little changed at 10.41 percent, according to
Bloomberg prices.  
 Colombia: The peso rose 0.4 percent to 1,910.20 per dollar.  
 The yield on Colombia's benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose one basis point to 8.79 percent, according to
Colombia's stock exchange.  
 Peru: The sol climbed 0.1 percent to 2.8385 per dollar.  
 The yield on Peru's 8.6 percent bond maturing August 2017
was little changed at 5.14 percent, according to Citigroup
Inc.'s unit in Lima.
