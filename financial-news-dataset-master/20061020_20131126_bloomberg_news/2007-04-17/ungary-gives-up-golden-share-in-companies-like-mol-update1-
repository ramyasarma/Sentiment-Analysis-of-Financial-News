             Hungarian lawmakers yesterday voted
to abolish `golden shares' that gave the government veto powers
for companies including refiner  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , spurring speculation
about takeovers.  
 Lawmakers late yesterday evening voted 202 to zero, with
119 abstentions, to approve a bill the government said was
required by the European Union. The act now awaits the signature
of the speaker, according to documents posted on the Hungarian
parliament's Web site.  
 Hungary in the 1990s sold most of its state assets and kept
special  voting rights  in companies it deemed strategic. The
`golden share' allowed the government to block corporate action
such as mergers and equity sales while giving it a seat on a
company's board. Losing the veto power makes the companies more
prone to takeover, investors said.  
 ``Abolishing golden shares makes companies like Mol more
vulnerable for takeovers,'' said Matthias Siller, who helps
oversee $3 billion at Baring Investors Service in  London .
``Speculators will not overlook this.''  
 The government said the act was needed to comply with
European Union requirements on the free movement of capital.  
 Other affected companies include OTP Bank Nyrt., the
country's largest lender, Magyar Telekom Nyrt., a unit of
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and the nation's electricity distributors,
now owned by Electricite de  France  and  Germany 's  RWE AG (RWE) , natural
gas distributors, held by  ENI SpA (ENI) , Gaz de France and  E.ON AG. (EOAN)
