             China 's reliance on oil imports may
increase by to 60 percent of demand by 2020, said a researcher
with the country's largest oil company.  
 Oil consumption may reach as much as 500 million tons (10
million barrels a day) by 2020, with domestic output at about 200
million tons, Hao Hongyi, head of strategy research at China
National Petroleum Corp., said at a conference in the northern
port city of Dalian today.  
 China's efforts to increase energy conservation won't curb a
growing need to buy oil from abroad, Hao said. China's oil
imports rose to 13.86 million tons in March, a record for any
month, according to the Customs General Administration of China.
The country imported 163 million tons of oil last year,
accounting for 47 percent of total consumption, Hao said.  
 ``Given the heavy reliance on oil imports, we must fully use
the energy resources in both domestic and foreign markets,'' Hao
said. China National Petroleum will continue its strategy of
accelerating overseas exploration this year, Hao said, without
elaborating.  
 Foreign countries' plans to expand their refineries and
exploration investment will help China to meet its domestic
demand, Hao said. Global oil output capacity will rise by 13.76
million barrels a day between 2006 and 2010, Hao said. Global
investment in oil and gas exploration is expected to rise to $280
billion this year from $226.2 billion in 2006, he said.  
 The country's annual oil output may increase to 193 million
tons by 2010, the National Development and Reform Commission said
April 10. China pumped 184 million tons more crude in 2006, the
China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association said Jan. 23.  
 Energy consumption will rise about 4 percent every year to
the equivalent of 2.7 billion tons of standard coal by 2010, the
commission said.
