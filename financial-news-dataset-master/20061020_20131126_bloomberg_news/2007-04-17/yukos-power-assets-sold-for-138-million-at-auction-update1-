             OAO Yukos Oil Co.'s power-
generating units were sold to OOO Monte-Valle for 3.56 billion
rubles ($138 million) at the third liquidation auction for
assets of what was once  Russia 's largest oil producer.  
 Today's auction bundled Yukos's power assets, including 3.2
percent of central Russian electricity generator TGK-4 and
minority stakes in Belgorodenergo and Tambovenergo. Monte-Valle
beat three other companies with a bid 34.8 percent higher than
the starting price of 2.64 billion rubles.  
 The sale was one of a series of auctions to liquidate
Yukos, which owes $27 billion to creditors, including the
Federal Tax Service and OAO Rosneft. Companies representing the
interests of OAO Gazprom and Rosneft, the state-run companies,
won the previous two auctions.  
 Rosneft unit OOO Neft-Aktiv participated in today's
auction. Gazprom and Rosneft spokesmen said that their companies
weren't behind Monte-Valle.
