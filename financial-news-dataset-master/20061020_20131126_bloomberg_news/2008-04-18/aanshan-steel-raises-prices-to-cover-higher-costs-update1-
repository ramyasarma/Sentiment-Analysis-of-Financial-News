             Maanshan Iron & Steel (600808)  Co.,  China 's
second-biggest Hong Kong-listed steelmaker, will raise May
prices for steel products by 2 percent to cover higher materials
costs.  
 The increase follows gains of as much as 25 percent in the
first quarter, general manager Su Jiangang told reporters today
in Hong Kong.  
 Maanshan Steel,  Angang Steel Co. (347)  and rivals are betting
rising Chinese demand from builders and carmakers will enable
them to keep increasing prices to cover higher costs. Prices of
iron ore and coking coal, used in steelmaking, soared to records
this year because of limited supplies.  
 ``We're not sure whether the price increase could fully
offset the rising costs because we're still unable to reach an
agreement on contracted  iron-ore  prices with Australian
suppliers,'' Su said.  
 Maanshan, based in Anhui province, rose 16 cents, or 4
percent, to HK$4.20 in Hong Kong today, beating the 0.3 percent
decline in the benchmark index.  
 Angang Steel, China's second-largest maker of the alloy  by
market value, said April 16 it plans to raise prices by more
than 10 percent in the second quarter to cover costs.  
 Want More  
 Maanshan imports about 80 percent of its iron ore, with
half of that coming from Australia, Su said. The remainder is
from  Brazil  and  India . Chinese steelmakers have agreed to pay
Brazil's Cia. Vale do Rio Doce as much as 71 percent more for
iron ore from April 1.  
 Australian suppliers BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group
are demanding more for their ore.  
 Maanshan Steel yesterday said 2007 profit gained 4.9
percent to 2.57 billion  yuan  ($368 million), beating analysts'
 expectations  for a decline because of lower taxes and a better
product mix.  
 The company plans to produce 16.9 million metric tons of
crude steel this year, up from 14.2 million tons in 2007, Su
said. Steel-product output may reach 15.8 million tons, up from
13.2 million tons.  
 The company plans to spend between 1 billion yuan and 8
billion yuan in capital expenditure this year, depending on the
approval of a project.  
 Exports of steel products may drop to 1 million tons this
year, from 1.2 million tons in 2007, as the government raised
taxes to curb shipments, Su said.
