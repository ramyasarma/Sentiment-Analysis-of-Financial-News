             ``88 Minutes,'' a thriller starring
 Al Pacino , won't open in theaters until today. That hasn't
stopped SurfTheChannel.com from playing it 51,000 times.  
 A new threat in Web piracy, SurfTheChannel links to 56.com,
Tudou.com and dozens of sites in China and other countries.
Streaming technology makes films and TV shows instantly available
on Web browsers, cloaks the viewer's identity and makes it almost
impossible for Hollywood to stop.  
 Sony Corp. (6758) 's ``88 Minutes,'' made for $30 million, is among
95,000 film and television titles at SurfTheChannel, where
visitors watching free videos have soared to 650,000 a month
since October. The Stockholm-based company offers films still in
theaters, such as  News Corp. (NWSA) 's ``Jumper,'' and movies not out yet,
including  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) 's ``Good Chemistry.''  
 ``For most of the last year, downloading was the dominant
form of movie piracy,'' said  David Davis , of Santa Monica,
California-based Arpeggio Partners, who began investigating
copyright infringement for  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  in 1999. ``Streaming
presents a much larger problem. It requires less technical skill
and, unlike downloads, it's available immediately.''  
 Online piracy cost the film industry $7.1 billion in 2005
and is the fastest-growing threat, according to the  Motion
Picture Association of America . The losses come as the industry
looks to the Web to replace shrinking DVD sales, which fell 2
percent to $23.7 billion in 2007, according to  Digital
Entertainment Group , a trade association. Sales of movie tickets,
averaging $6.88 in the U.S., rose less than 1 percent last year,
according to the MPAA.  
 Web Links  
 SurfTheChannel, which uses an  Internet service  to hide its
location, links to sites that make copyrighted material available,
spokesman Richard Foxton said in an e-mail. It's legal because
the content doesn't reside on SurfTheChannel's network, he wrote.  
 That may not protect the site's parent, SurfTheChannel Ltd.,
from litigation, said Rob Rader, an entertainment attorney at
Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp LLP in  Los Angeles .  
 Dozens of sites including QuickSilverScreen.com, Joox.net
and SideReel.com provide similar services. SurfTheChannel had a
page on MySpace.com, News Corp.'s social networking site. News
Corp.'s spokeswoman  Julie Henderson  said MySpace has ``zero
tolerance'' for piracy. SurfTheChannel's page was blocked after
the company learned of it.  
 ``Linking to content you know, or reasonably should have
known, is illegal is a lawsuit waiting to happen,'' Rader said in
an interview. ``For movies or TV shows that are currently in
release, this adds insult to actual economic injury.''  
 Quality Varies  
 About 40 percent of SurfTheChannel's visitors are from the
U.S., the most of any country, according to researcher Alexa.com.
U.S. visitors totaled 259,000 in March, Reston, Virginia-based
ComScore Inc. said, suggesting a worldwide audience of 650,000.
Foxton puts the total above 2 million.  
 The quality of films at SurfTheChannel varies. Some are
shaky copies recorded in theaters. Others are similar to DVDs or
broadcast TV. ``Evan Almighty'' had Chinese subtitles. Camcorders
in theaters account for the majority of movie piracy while theft
during film production also contributes, according to the  Motion
Picture Association .  
 Advertisers at SurfTheChannel include Qualcomm Inc.'s
MediaFLO, which promoted programming from NBC. Visitors are asked
to donate to Cancer Research UK.  
 ``STC's existence has never been for commercial gain,''
Foxton said. ``It's a good month if we manage to cover our
hosting costs, which has happened once so far.''  
 The studios are battling piracy as much through marketing as
the legal system.  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and Disney are putting episodes of
new and vintage TV shows and films online. Hulu.com, started
March 12 by  General Electric Co. (GE) 's NBC and News Corp.'s Fox,
offers TV programs and movies such as ``The Big Lebowski.''  
 Worldwide Releases  
 Sony's film unit, based in Culver City, California, releases
big-budget films such as ``Spider-Man 3'' on the same day
worldwide to reach more people and cut demand for pirated copies.  
 ``To fight piracy, the best way to do it is to be out there
readily available, well-timed, well-priced to market,''  Robert Iger , Disney's chief executive, said at a March 10 investor
conference. ``It doesn't mean you're still not going to get
pilfered. It happens all the time.''  
 Sony, based in Tokyo, doesn't expect U.S. ticket sales for
``88 Minutes'' to be noticeably lower because the film is online
free, spokesman  Jim Kennedy  said.  
 Sweden is starting to crack down. Last month, the government
began targeting file sharing after the  International Federation
of the Phonographic Industry  registered complaints against
PirateBay.com which, like SurfTheChannel, locates pirated
material. It may also require Internet providers to identify
people illegally sharing music and films.  
 Legal Remedies  
 Other legal remedies remain elusive. Sites that are shut
down often reappear under a new name, said John Malcolm, director
of anti-piracy operations for the MPAA.  
 SurfTheChannel was told by one network to remove shows or
face prison and a $1 million fine, the blog MakeUseOf.com
reported Feb. 3, citing Coco Lambucca, the director of operations.
None of the listings were removed, Foxton said.  
 The threat posed by streaming raises the possibility studios
may face the same fate as the  music industry , where sales are
shrinking and ``tens of billions'' of illegal files were swapped
in 2007, the phonographic association said.  
 ``This is exactly what every Hollywood studio should fear,''
 Rich Greenfield , an analyst at Pali Capital in New York, said in
an interview. ``SurfTheChannel is the beginning of what happened
to the music industry.''

The film, starring Al Pacino, won't be in theaters until April 18. That hasn't stopped SurfTheChannel.com from playing it 30,500 times.
