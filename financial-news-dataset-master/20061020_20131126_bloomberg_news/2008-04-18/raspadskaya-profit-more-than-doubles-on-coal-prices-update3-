             OAO Raspadskaya (RASP) ,  Russia 's second-
largest producer of coal used in steelmaking, said full-year
profit more than doubled as sales and prices increased.  
 Net income rose to $239 million, or 31 cents a share, from
$99.6 million, or 15 cents, in 2006, the Kemerovo region-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales climbed 67
percent to $784.1 million.  
 Prices for coking coal and iron ore have surged to records
this year because of supply constraints and rising steel demand.
Asian steelmakers agreed this month to pay BHP Billiton Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Corp. $300 a metric ton for coking coal, up from $98 a
year earlier.  
 Profit will rise this year as higher prices ``endure for the
foreseeable future,'' Chief Executive Officer Gennady Kozovoy
said in the statement.  
 Raspadskaya  increased  55 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $9.15 at
the close in Moscow, the highest since the shares were listed in
November 2006. The stock has gained 41 percent this year, and
today valued the company at $7.1 billion.  
 Output grew 28 percent to a record 13.6 million tons.
Production costs fell by about 4 percent to $11.50 a ton. Raw-
coal prices averaged 27 percent higher, the company said.  
 The margin on earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability, rose
to 63 percent, from 55 percent.  
 Raspadskaya proposed a full-year dividend of 5 rubles, 158
percent more than in 2006.  
 Russia's biggest coking coal producer is  OAO Mechel. (MTLR)
