             Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon’s
top Shiite Muslim cleric who was once regarded as the spiritual
leader of Hezbollah, died in Beirut after suffering “serious
internal bleeding,” the state-run National News Agency
reported.  
 Fadlallah, who was born in 1935, had advocated armed
resistance by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite party and militia,
to Israel’s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended
with an Israeli withdrawal in 2000. He supported the creation of
a Palestinian state in what is now Israel, the West Bank and
Gaza.  
 The cleric was a supporter of the 1979 Iranian revolution
that brought Shiite clerics to power, though he distanced
himself from Iranian claims to spiritual leadership of Shiites
worldwide. Hezbollah head  Hassan Nasrallah , who is backed
militarily and politically by Iran, follows the Iranian line.  
 Finding a replacement will be a test of Iran’s influence in
Lebanon, said  Oussama Safa , director of the  Lebanese Center for
Policy Studies  in Beirut. “The Iranians will want someone
closer to their thinking,” he said in a telephone interview.
“It’s unlikely that the Iranians can impose a successor, but
one will have to be at least suitable to them.”  
 Fadlallah issued a fatwa, or religious decree, in 2002
prohibiting Muslims from aiding a U.S. strike on Iraq, which is
home to two of the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims. “God
forbids helping the infidels against the Muslims, the oppressors
against the oppressed,” he said at the time in a faxed
statement.  
 ‘Colonization’  
 In his last sermon, issued July 1 on his website, Fadlallah
warned against what he called the Judaization of Jerusalem,
saying Israeli authorities would “by means of the biggest
colonization scheme” confiscate Palestinian property and drive
Arabs out of the city.  
 In an e-mailed statement, Hezbollah called for three days
of mourning. The cleric’s funeral will take place July 6,
according to the independent An Nahar newspaper.  
 Israel and Hezbollah fought a month long war in the summer
of 2006. Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist organization
by the U.S. and Israel, is part of a coalition government under
Prime Minister  Saad Hariri , who heads a pro-Western bloc.
