             Parliamentary leaders of Germany’s
government coalition agreed on extending the operating life of
the nation’s nuclear power plants by more than 10 years, Der
Spiegel  reported , without saying where it got the information.  
 Volker Kauder , leader of Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democratic bloc in the lower house, and  Birgit Homburger , his Free Democratic Party counterpart, agreed to
draft a bill “that leans on” Economy Minster  Rainer Bruederle ’s position, the magazine said on its  website .
Bruederle wants an extension of at least 15 years.  
 The plan contradicts  Norbert Roettgen , minister for the
environment, who wants to limit any operating extension to 10
years. Parliament will deliberate the bill in the last week of
September, according to Der Spiegel.  
 Under current German law, all nuclear power stations are
supposed to close by about 2021.
