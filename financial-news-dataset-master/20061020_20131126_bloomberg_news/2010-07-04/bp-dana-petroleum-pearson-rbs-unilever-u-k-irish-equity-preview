             U.K. stocks fell, following two
weeks of declines for the benchmark FTSE 100 Index, as concern
about the economic recovery overshadowed a rally in shares of
BP Plc.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. led declines by basic resources
companies, falling 2.2 percent. Marks & Spencer Group Plc and
Next Plc climbed more than 1 percent after Eurostat reported
that U.K. retail sales in May were up 2.3 percent on a year
earlier. BP Plc gained 3.5 percent after the Sunday Times
reported that the company is seeking a strategic investor.  
 The  FTSE 100  slipped 0.3 percent to 4,823.53. The gauge
has tumbled 17 percent from its high this year on April 15 as a
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and disappointing economic
reports in the U.S. and China fanned concern that the world may
tip back into recession. The  FTSE All-Share Index  fell 0.2
percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  lost 0.6 percent.  
 “The economic growth path will remain bumpy,” said
 Christoph Riniker , a strategist at Bank Julius Baer Group Ltd.
in Zurich, which manages about $226 billion. “Equity investors
have priced in a double dip with current valuations. So, the
overall environment looks a little shaky.”  
 Mining Stocks  
 BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, dropped
2.2 percent to 1,684.5 pence, while Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s third-largest, slipped 1.8 percent to 2,880.5 pence.
African Barrick Gold Ltd., which joined the FTSE 100 in June,
fell 2.3 percent to 600.5 pence.
      Marks & Spencer  and Next, the U.K.’s two largest publicly
traded clothing retailers, gained 2.6 percent to 341.9 pence
and 1.3 percent to 2,014 pence, respectively. Eurostat, the
European Union’s data-gathering agency, reported that U.K.
retail sales climbed 0.6 percent in May from the month before.
That compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the euro region.  
 The retail sales update lifted other parts of the
industry. Fashion retailer Burberry Plc added 0.7 percent to
745 pence. Kingfisher Plc, the home improvement chain that owns
B&Q in the U.K., climbed 1.2 percent to 210.3 pence. Tesco Plc
advanced 1.6 percent to 389.05 pence.  
 BP Climbs  
 BP , struggling to contain the worst oil spill in U.S.
history, is seeking a strategic investor who could help the
company thwart takeover bids, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information. The shares climbed
3.5 percent to 333.3 pence.  
 Berkeley Group Holdings Plc climbed 1.6 percent to 785.5
pence. The homebuilder was upgraded to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 Travis Perkins Plc, the owner of the Wickes home-
improvement chain, agreed to buy BSS Group Plc for 557.6
million pounds ($847 million) to create the U.K.’s largest
plumbing and heating chain. BSS shares gained 2.6 percent to
427 pence, while Travis Perkins shares slipped 0.2 percent to
753 pence.  
 Early trades in the shares of Eurasian Natural Resources
Plc were canceled by the London Stock Exchange at 10 a.m. in
London. The company’s shares rose as much as 30 percent before
erasing their gains, losing 2.8 percent to 818 pence.
