             Japanese and Australian  stock  futures
fell after employment in the U.S. slid and factory orders slid,
spurring concerns the global economic recovery will falter.  
 American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest automaker, closed 0.8 percent down from the
Tokyo close on July 2. Those of  Sharp Corp. , which receives more
than half of its sales overseas, fell 1.1 percent. Credit Suisse
Group AG rated the electronics maker “underperform” in new
coverage. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s second-
largest oil and gas producer, slid 0.2 percent from the closing
price in Sydney after crude oil prices declined.  
 “The U.S. economy is slowing down,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“The employment data was as bad as expected.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 9,170 in Chicago on July 2,
compared with 9,210 in Osaka. They were  bid  in the pre-market at
9,180 as of 8:05 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed at 9203.71,
on July 2.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  fell 0.7 percent.
New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained 0.2 percent today in
Wellington.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  dropped 3.4 percent last week,
as weaker manufacturing growth in the U.S., Europe and China
added to signs the global economic recovery is slowing.
Companies in the gauge trade at 13.6 times estimated earnings,
the lowest since December 2008.  
 U.S. Jobs Data  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined 0.7
percent. The gauge retreated 0.5 percent in New York on July 2,
after the U.S. Labor Department said payrolls decreased by
125,000 last month, the first drop this year, and after factory
orders declined more than forecast.  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 1.1 percent in New York
on July 2, the lowest settlement since June 8.  
 Fast Retailing Co.  may be active today after Nomura Holdings
Inc. cut the clothing retailer’s rating to “neutral” from
“buy.”  
 HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest bank, said it has
agreed to acquire The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s retail
and commercial banking businesses in India for as much as $95
million.
