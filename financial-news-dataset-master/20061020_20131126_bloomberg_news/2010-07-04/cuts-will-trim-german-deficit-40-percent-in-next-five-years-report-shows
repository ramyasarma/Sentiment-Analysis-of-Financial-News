             Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
proposed spending cuts that will reduce Germany’s federal budget
deficit by about 40 percent over the next five years.  
 The total deficit cuts from 2010 through 2014 are about 137
billion euros ($172 billion), with energy subsidies and the
armed forces facing some of the biggest spending reductions, the
ministry report released yesterday in Berlin said. The blueprint
assumes annual economic growth of between 1 percent and 1.5
percent.  
 The new plan projects a total federal budget deficit of
218.5 billion euros for the period 2010 through 2014. This
compares with a 355.4 billion euro deficit that had been
projected in a Finance Ministry report from July 2009.  
 While Germany’s economy, Europe’s largest, is showing signs
of recovery, some lawmakers are skeptical that Schaeuble will
realize all the savings. “It looks impressive on paper -- we’re
the new champions of austerity,” said opposition Greens budget
spokesman Alexander Bonde, in an interview yesterday. “But I
have serious doubts about the feasibility of some of the
savings.”  
 Chancellor  Angela Merkel  says she lacks alternatives to
cutting spending in the biggest member of the 16-state euro-
region after yields on bonds of some heavily indebted euro
members soared this year. She’s drawn criticism from some
members of the Group of 20 states, including the U.S., for
pushing austerity amid fragile global economic recovery.  
 ‘Debt Brake’  
 Germany’s push to cut spending is rooted in a
constitutional amendment of 2009 that preceded the euro crisis.
The legal move, dubbed a “debt brake,” compels Germany to push
down the public sector’s deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic
product by 2013 and its federal component to 0.35 percent of GDP
from 2016.  
 The cuts, aimed at slashing Germany’s record post-World War
II deficit, were agreed upon last month by Merkel’s government
and include 7.5 billion euros in annual reductions of mainly
energy subsidies and a 3 billion euro annual cut to the Defense
Ministry budget.  
 Merkel has European Union backing for her savings drive.
The EU may boost sanctions against euro-region states that break
fiscal rules. Punishments may include insolvency for chronic
debtor states or cutting farm subsidies, Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said last month.  
 The blueprint says that net new borrowing, used to plug the
deficit, will shrink this year to 65 billion euros from 80
billion euros projected by the Finance Ministry last July.  
 In 2011, net borrowing will drop to 57.5 billion euros in
the new plan, compared with 76.6 billion euros in the old
projection.  
 The new borrowing target will be set at 40 billion euros
compared with the previous target of 69 billion euros in 2012;
31.6 billion euros compared with 64.4 billion euros in 2013; and
24 billion euros compared with 64.4 billion euros in 2014.  
 Schaeuble will formally present his budget plans at a press
conference in Berlin on July 7.
