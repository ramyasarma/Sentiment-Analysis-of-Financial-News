             Ivan Rodriguez  hit a bases-loaded
single to cap a three-run ninth-inning rally by the Washington
Nationals, who defeated the New York Mets 6-5 in a Major League
Baseball game.  
 Adam Dunn  tied the game with one out in the ninth on a
bases-loaded two-run double. Play was interrupted for two
minutes as officials watched a replay before ruling the hit was
not a home run.  
 Mets closer  Francisco Rodriguez  (2-2) then intentionally
walked  Josh Willingham  to reload the bases before Nationals
catcher Rodriguez connected to send  Ryan Zimmerman  home with
the winning run at Nationals Park. Francisco Rodriguez
surrendered three hits, three runs and three walks in a third
of an inning to take the loss.  
 Nationals rookie pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  gave up the
first two runs of the game as Jason Bay scored  Alex Cora  on a
double in the first inning and  Josh Thole  drove in  David Wright 
in the third. He went five innings, giving up four hits, two
runs and three walks, while striking out five.  
 Willingham and Ivan Rodriguez each hit scoring singles in
the sixth inning for the Nationals to tie the game at 2-2
before the Mets (45-36) scored three in the eighth as Wright
singled in Cora, Thole doubled to score Wright, and  Ike Davis 
scored on  Ruben Tejada ’s sacrifice fly.  
 Adam Kennedy  singled home a run in the bottom of the
eighth to bring the Nationals within two.  
 Matt Capps  (2-3) pitched the ninth inning for the
Nationals (36-46) to get the win.
