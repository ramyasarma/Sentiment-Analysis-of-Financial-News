             Two Germans were kidnapped in
Nigeria, Germany’s Foreign Ministry said.  
 A crisis team has been set up to get them released, a
spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Berlin said today.
Agence France Press reported yesterday that seven Russians, two
Germans, one Lithuanian, a Latvian and two Ukrainians were
kidnapped after gunmen attacked a cargo ship in the waters off
the coast of Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta region.  
 Members on the MV BBC Palonia vessel in the Niger Delta
were taken hostage by gunmen on July 2, and their whereabouts
are not known, Timothy Antigha, an army colonel and spokesman,
said today. It wasn’t immediately clear if this is the same
vessel carrying the two Germans.  
 “Security agencies are working round the clock to recover
them,” Antigha said by phone from the southern Nigerian city of
Yenagoa. “We are trying to establish the nationalities of the
crew.”  
 The vessel in the Niger Delta was attacked on July 2,
Agence France Press said, citing Nigerian navy spokesman David
Nabaida. One of the crew members, a Ukrainian national, was
injured in the attack and was in stable condition at a hospital
in Bonny, it reported.  
 No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack,
according to AFP.
