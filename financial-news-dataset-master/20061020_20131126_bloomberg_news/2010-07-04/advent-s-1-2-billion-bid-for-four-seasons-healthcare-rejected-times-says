             Advent International Corp. made a bid
of 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion) for Four Seasons Healthcare
Ltd. that was turned down, the  Sunday Times said , without saying
where it got the information.  
 The board of Four Seasons rejected the approach because it
undervalued the business, the newspaper said. Four Seasons has
790 million pounds of debt due for repayment at the start of
September, and plans to extend the maturity of a 600 million
pound loan until at least 2013, the Times said.  
 Advisers to Four Seasons also believed that Advent would
have struggled to raise the bank debt required for its approach,
according to the newspaper.  
 Louisa Feltes, an external spokeswoman for Advent at
Financial Dynamics in London, declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg today.
