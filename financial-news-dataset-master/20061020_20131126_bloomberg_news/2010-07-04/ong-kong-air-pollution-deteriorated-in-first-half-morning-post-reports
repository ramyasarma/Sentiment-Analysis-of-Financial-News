             Hong Kong’s air quality continued to 
deteriorate in the first half of the year, with the city’s  
air pollution index recording 20 percent more days of “very 
high” readings at street level than a year earlier, the South 
China Morning Post reported, citing government data.  
 The readings were driven up by a sandstorm in China that 
blew pollutants into the city between March 21 and March 23, 
driving the index to its maximum level of 500 for 106 hours, 
the newspaper quoted the Environmental Protection Department as
saying.
