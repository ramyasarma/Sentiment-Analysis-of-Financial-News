             China asked the nation’s securities
companies to strengthen information management for better public
monitoring and to prevent conflicts of interest, according to a
 statement  posted yesterday on the government’s website.  
 Publicly traded brokerages should improve the registration
of information insiders, and confidentiality and firewall
systems to prevent “conflicts of interest and insider
trading,” according to the statement, citing the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, which made the additions to
its regulations published March 2009.  
 The securities firms should disclose major monthly
financial figures to the public at the same as it reports to the
regulator, according to the statement. The brokerages should
also publish regulatory decisions and evaluations concerning the
companies’ administration, the watchdog said.
