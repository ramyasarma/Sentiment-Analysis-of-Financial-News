             Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
urged Armenia and Azerbaijan to seek a durable peace as tensions
rise between the two former Soviet republics.  
 “Peace is possible and necessary,” Clinton told reporters
in the Azeri capital Baku today. “It is a prerequisite for
building a secure and prosperous future in both nations.”  
 Troops of the two nations have clashed at a ceasefire line
and Azerbaijan has held large-scale military exercises in the
last month. The two countries, squeezed between Russia and Iran,
both maintain friendly relations with the U.S.  
 Clinton met with Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev  for lunch in
Baku today before flying to the Armenian capital Yerevan for a
dinner meeting with Armenian President  Serzh Sargsyan . It was
the first visit to the two countries by a U.S. secretary of
state since 1992.  
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia
fought a war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a majority-
Armenian-populated region inside Azerbaijan. A 1994 cease-fire
left a fifth of Azerbaijan under Armenian control and more than
10 percent of its population displaced. The frozen conflict is
reminiscent of deadlocked separatist disputes in neighboring
Georgia that erupted into war with Russia two years ago.  
 The U.S. is also backing reconciliation between Armenia and
its neighbor Turkey, and Clinton praised Sargsyan for his
determination to normalize relations.  
 “We urge Turkey to take the steps it promised to take,”
she told reporters in Yerevan.  
 Clinton is on a four-day trip through five countries that
until two decades ago were either part of the Soviet Union or
under its influence. She started in Ukraine and Poland,
finishing her trip tomorrow in Georgia.
