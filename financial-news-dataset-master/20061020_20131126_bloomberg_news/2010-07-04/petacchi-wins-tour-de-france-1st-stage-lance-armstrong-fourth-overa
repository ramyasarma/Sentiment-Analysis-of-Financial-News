             Italy’s  Alessandro Petacchi  won
today’s opening stage of the Tour de France, seven years after
his last success at cycling’s most prestigious race.  
 The 36-year-old Lampre team rider, winner of four stages in
2003, came first on today’s 223.5-kilometer (139-mile) stage
from Rotterdam to Brussels after a series of crashes near the
end ruled several contenders out of the sprint finish.  
 Britain’s Mark Cavendish of the HTC-Columbia team was among
sprinters who finished down the field after being involved in
the pile-ups. Cavendish’s teammate Mark Renshaw of Australia was
second, with Norway’s  Thor Hushovd  of Cervelo in third. Team
RadioShack’s seven-time champion  Lance Armstrong  was 55th.  
 Switzerland’s  Fabian Cancellara  of Team Saxo Bank, winner
of yesterday’s prologue, retains the race leader’s yellow
jersey. He leads Tony Martin of HTC-Columbia by 10 seconds, with
David Millar of Garmin-Transitions 10 seconds further back.
Armstrong is fourth.  
 Defending champion Alberto Contador of Astana, a teammate
of Armstrong last year, is sixth overall.  
 Tomorrow’s second stage is a  201-kilometer ride  from
Brussels to Spa. The 3,642-kilometer race ends on the Champs-
Elysees in Paris on July 25.
