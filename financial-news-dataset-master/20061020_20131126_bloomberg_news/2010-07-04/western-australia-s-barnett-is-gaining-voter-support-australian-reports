             Western Australian leader Colin
Barnett is viewed as a better premier than his Labor opponent by
60 percent of voters, up from 58 percent in an earlier poll, the
Australian newspaper reported, citing a Newspoll survey
conducted between April and June. Labor leader Eric Ripper’s
support held steady at 19 percent, the newspaper said. The
state’s Liberal-National coalition was preferred by 44 percent
of respondents, while 32 percent preferred Labor, according to
the newspaper. Newspoll surveyed 856 people by telephone and the
poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
