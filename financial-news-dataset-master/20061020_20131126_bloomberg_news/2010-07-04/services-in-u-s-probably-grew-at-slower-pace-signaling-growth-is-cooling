             Service industries in the U.S.
expanded at a slower pace in June, indicating the economy
started to cool entering the second half, economists said before
reports this week.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of non-
manufacturing businesses, which make up about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 55 from 55.4 in May, according to the  median  of
59 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of the July 6
report. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  
 Companies such as  Bed Bath and Beyond Inc.  may find it
harder to boost sales without faster job growth as government
stimulus wanes. Private hiring last month rose less than
forecast and a report later this week is forecast to show
jobless claims are at a level that indicates firings are staying
elevated.  
 “The economy is showing some loss of momentum,” said  Jim O’Sullivan , chief economist at MF Global Ltd. in New York.
“It’s going to be three steps forward and one step back, and
right now we’re in the one-step-back phase. Ultimately we need
further acceleration in payrolls.”  
 The figures on services follow reports last week that
showed a slowdown in manufacturing and weakness in housing, at
the same time Europe grapples with a debt crisis and China tries
to slow its economy.  
 First-time  filings  for unemployment insurance fell to
460,000 last week from 472,000, according to the median estimate
in the Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department’s July 8
report. Claims around 450,000 are consistent with private
companies adding about 100,000 jobs a month, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief economist  Bruce Kasman .  
 Private Employment  
 Employment at companies rose 83,000 last month, less than
the 110,000 increase forecast by economists in a Bloomberg
survey, Labor Department figures showed on July 2. Including
government, payrolls fell for the first time this year because
of a drop in federal census workers. The  jobless rate  decreased
to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent as the labor force shrank.  
 The outlook for jobs is one reason consumer  confidence  sank
more than forecast in June, according to a Conference Board
report. It raises the risk household spending, which accounts
for about 70 percent of the economy, will falter.  
 Bed Bath & Beyond, a Union, New Jersey-based retailer, last
month forecast current-quarter and annual earnings that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  
 Facing Challenges  
 “It appears the consumer continues to face economic
challenges, and the pressures of the macroeconomic environment
still persist,”  Leonard Feinstein , the company’s co-chairman,
said on a conference call on June 23.  
 Concerns about unemployment and reluctance to make large
purchases were also reflected last week in lower-than-
anticipated auto sales in June for General Motors Co. and Ford
Motor Co., the two largest U.S. automakers.  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Retailing  Index  has
fallen 22 percent since a 19-month peak on April 26, compared
with a 16 percent decline in the broader S&P 500  gauge  from its
19-month peak on April 23.  
 The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s ISM services survey covers
industries that range from utilities and retailing to health
care, housing and finance.  
 Housing, which helped trigger the recession, is showing
signs of renewed weakness following the end of a government tax
credit of as much as $8,000 for buyers. The absence of faster
job growth and rising foreclosures are depressing property
prices.  
 Federal Reserve  
 Economic data in recent weeks and Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis underscore why Federal Reserve policy makers renewed a
pledge last month to keep interest rates near a record low.
Central bankers said the recovery is “likely to be moderate for
a time,” according to their statement. Consumer spending still
“remains constrained” by joblessness and “tight credit,”
they said.  
 Services have been lagging behind manufacturing, which led
the economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009. The ISM
reported on July 1 that  factories  expanded in June at the
slowest pace this year as orders and exports cooled, adding to
concern financial-market turmoil sparked by Europe’s debt
problems will hurt global growth.
