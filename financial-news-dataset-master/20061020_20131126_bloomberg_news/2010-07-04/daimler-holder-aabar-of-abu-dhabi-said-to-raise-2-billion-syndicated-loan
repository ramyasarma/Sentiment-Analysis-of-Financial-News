             Aabar Investments PJSC , the Abu Dhabi
company that is the biggest shareholder in carmaker Daimler AG,
is borrowing $2 billion to refinance debt and for acquisitions,
a banker familiar with the plan said.  
 The syndication that began on July 1 already raised $1.4
billion from six banks, including the four book runners  Deutsche
Bank AG ,  Morgan Stanley , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
 National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , said the banker, who declined
to be identified because the deal hasn’t been completed. Credit
Suisse Group AG and Union National Bank PJSC also contributed to
the syndication, the banker said.  
 Nobody was available to comment at state-controlled Aabar
when Bloomberg News called the company’s headquarters today.
Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley did not respond
to phone calls seeking comment. Spokesmen for Credit Suisse,
RBS, NBAD and Union National Bank declined to comment. Reuters
first reported the loan July 2.  
 The three-year facility includes a $1.4 billion term-loan
and a $600 million revolving credit facility, both of which pay
150 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, the
banker said. Banks have three weeks to respond to the loan.  
 Aabar last month bought a 4.99 percent stake in Italy’s
biggest bank UniCredit SpA valued at $2.2 billion. The company
has total long-term liabilities of 19.6 billion dirhams ($5.3
billion) at the end of March, according to Bloomberg data.
