             Bahraini Central Bank Governor
 Rasheed al-Maraj  said the four Persian Gulf states planning a
single currency are committed to their goal and are monitoring
developments in the euro region.  
 “We are learning from what is happening in Europe,” al-
Maraj said in an interview in Aix-en-Provence, France. “We keep
our commitment. I am sure the four countries have the same
views.”  
 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain took an initial
step toward a single currency on March 30 when their central
bank governors held the first meeting of the Monetary Council, a
precursor to a united central bank. Kuwait’s dinar is pegged to
a basket of currencies while the other three countries have a
dollar peg. The United Arab Emirates and Oman have pulled out of
the project.  
 Al-Maraj said the Gulf states are watching the euro zone’s
decisions on “public debt and the fiscal policies.”  
 Bahrain’s currency will remain pegged to the dollar, he
said.  
 “I think we are not going to change our foreign exchange
policy on this short term volatility,” he said. “Currency
markets always become very volatile from time to time.”
