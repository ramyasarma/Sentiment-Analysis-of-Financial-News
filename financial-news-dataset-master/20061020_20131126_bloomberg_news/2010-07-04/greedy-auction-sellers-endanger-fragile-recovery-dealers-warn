-- Greedy Auction Sellers Endanger Fragile Recovery, Dealers Warn

             The recovery in the global art market
slowed at the latest bellwether auctions of Impressionist and
contemporary works where overpriced lots struggled to attract
bidding, dealers said.  
 Expectations for two weeks of London sales had been raised
by recent auction records for works by Alberto  Giacometti , Pablo
 Picasso  and Amedeo  Modigliani  and reports of brisk business at
the Art Basel fair in Switzerland. Sellers pushed up estimates
at a time when choosy buyers are now only willing to pay the
largest sums for the best trophy works, dealers said.  
 “The auction houses had talked themselves into getting
higher and higher prices,”  Richard Nagy , a London-based dealer,
said in an interview. “They need to be less excitable about
their estimates.” Prior to the sales, surveys showed there was
no room for greed or over-optimism for less-than-perfect works,
with confidence still fragile. Respondents suggested that values
were likely to be little changed over the next six months.  
 The London auctions amounted to a 421.2 million-pound
($640.3 million) test of the market, according to Bloomberg
calculations. The sales began with an  Edouard Manet  self
portrait falling to a single bid of 22.4 million pounds; a ‘Blue
Period’ Picasso selling within estimate for 34.8 million pounds
and a  Claude Monet  lily painting, valued as much as 40 million
pounds, failing to sell. By the end, “buyer fatigue” set in as
nervous collectors watched stock prices.  
 “All those top pieces were sophisticated and needed
knowledge,” Nagy said of the big-ticket Impressionist works.
“If the Monet had been priced at 15 million pounds to 25
million pounds, it might have made 30 million.”  
 Sale Estimates  
 The June sales at  Sotheby’s ,  Christie’s International  and
Phillips de Pury & Co. had been estimated to fetch between 353.7
million pounds and 477.1 million pounds, based on hammer prices.
All realized prices include auction-house fees.  
 Sellers of museum-quality Impressionist works had hoped
bidding from Asia, Russia and the Middle East would help push
prices to record levels. On this occasion, there was less buying
from clients in the emerging economies, Sotheby’s and Christie’s
said.  
 “These people know how to look after their money,”  Alan Hobart , director of the London-based  Pyms Gallery , said. “If
they sense the market isn’t what they’ve been led to believe,
they’ll sit back and wait.”  
 Still, selling rates never fell below 69 percent at
Sotheby’s and Christie’s evening and day sales of Impressionist
art.  
 Inconsistent Buying  
 Buying was more inconsistent during the following week’s
contemporary art auctions.  
 All three of the most expensive works at Sotheby’s 41.1
million-pound evening sale on June 28 sold within estimate.
Phillips’s June 29 evening sale -- held on a day when the  FTSE
100 Index  dropped by 3.1 percent -- raised 4 million pounds
against a low estimate of 6 million pounds with 53 percent of
the lots successful. On July 1, Christie’s day sale of
contemporary works totaled a low-estimate 13.1 million pounds
with 65 percent of the 318 works sold.  
 Prices of some contemporary artists are recovering after
declining as much as 50 percent from their peak. The London
sales showed buyers hesitant if sellers were perceived too be
unrealistic. At Sotheby’s on June 28,  Peter Doig’s  1995 to 1996
mountain landscape “White Creep” was offered with a low
estimate of 1.4 million pounds, having been bought for that
price by the seller at Sotheby’s in February 2008. It failed to
attract a bid.  
 Unstable Markets  
 “The mood has changed,” Hobart said. “At the beginning
of May, people thought the banking crisis was behind us. Then
the sovereign-debt problems hit. That’s where the problem is.
The markets are very unstable at the moment.”  
 In May, average prices at Sotheby’s and Christie’s evening
sales of contemporary works in New York stood at 2.9 million
pounds, more than double the 1.4 million pounds achieved last
year, the London-based research company  ArtTactic  said. A month
later in London, prices at the two houses’ evening sales
averaged 903,125 pounds, a smaller increase on the 619,444
pounds set last June during the financial crisis.  
 In 2008, during the final phase of the contemporary-art
market boom, the average price stood at 1.5 million pounds,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 “In May there seemed to be strength of demand across all
artists and all quality categories,”  Francis Outred , Christie’s
European head of contemporary art, said in an interview. “The
estimates got ahead of themselves. The market is still moving in
the right direction. From now on we have to exercise
discretion.”  
 No Bacon  
 Christie’s  June 30 evening sale raised a within-estimate
45.6 million pounds, the highest total for the week, with a top
price of 6.8 million pounds paid for  Andy Warhol’s  1963 “Silver
Liz.” The London-based auction house’s equivalent auction in
2008 netted 86.2 million pounds, led by a triptych of  Francis Bacon  self portraits at 17.3 million pounds. No works by Bacon
were offered at London auctions in June 2010.  
 “A lot of people thought the market was back. It isn’t
yet,” said Anthony McNerney, managing director at the London-
based gallery,  Ben Brown Fine Arts , and a former contemporary-
art specialist at  Phillips de Pury.  “Buyers are very sensitive
to price. The auction houses need to be careful and keep their
sales tight.”
