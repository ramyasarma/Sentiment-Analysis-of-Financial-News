             Carlos Dunga  will be replaced as
coach of Brazil’s national soccer team after it was eliminated
from the World Cup by the Netherlands three days ago.  
 A successor will be named this month, Brazil’s soccer
federation said on its website. Dunga’s team began the World Cup
as the favorite to win a record-extending sixth title.  
 Dunga, who captained Brazil’s 1994 World Cup-winning team,
said his contract had come to an end with the 2-1 loss to the
Netherlands.  
 “I was contracted for four years and we knew this right
from the start,” the 46-year-old told reporters in South Africa
after the game.  
 Dunga, who played in three World Cups, was accused by local
journalists and commentators of betraying Brazil’s famed Joga
Bonito, or beautiful play, since he became coach. His team
played a more conservative style, with midfielders helping to
support the defenders. Dunga dismissed the criticism before the
start of the World Cup.  
 “Everybody has their own taste and preferences,” Dunga
said in a pre-match press conference at Ellis Park in
Johannesburg. “I really like winning, that’s all. It doesn’t
matter whether someone likes you or not. What counts is what
happens on the field.”  
 The team, known as the Selecao, was trying to become the
only squad to have won soccer’s biggest prize on every continent
it’s been played. Brazil instead exited at the quarterfinal
stage for the second tournament in a row.
