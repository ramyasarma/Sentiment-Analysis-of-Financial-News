              The proposed new Cabinet of Czech
Prime Minister Petr Necas has no immediate plans to sell state
assets as a way to boost revenue, said Miroslav Kalousek, the
candidate to become the Czech Republic’s next finance minister.  
 “We don’t have to hurry, we can wait,” said Kalousek in
an interview today on Czech Television. “For 2011, we don’t
have any plan.”  
 The three political parties in talks to form a new
government pledged to slash spending to cut the 2011 budget
deficit to about 135 billion koruna ($6.6 billion). Even with
the prospect of added revenue from asset sales, Kalousek said it
may be difficult to find investors with sufficient “investment
appetite” to buy assets including the Prague International
Airport during continued sluggish economic times.  
 In a separate interview with Pravo’s Sunday edition,
Kalousek said that the state’s energy companies, including CEZ
AS, the largest electricity producer, should stay in state
hands.  
 “In today’s world, they continue to have a strategic
meaning, from the point of view of national security and
sovereignty,” he said. “Everyone is agreed, there will not be
any privatization.”
