             Japan’s  sumo  association decided
today to expel wrestler Kotomitsuki and stablemaster Otake over
their involvement in baseball gambling, public broadcaster NHK
reported, citing sources with knowledge of the decision.  
 The decision came this afternoon at an emergency meeting of
the association, the broadcaster said. Kotomitsuki holds the
sport’s second-highest rank of ozeki, or champion, while Otake
is a former wrestler who took over as head of his stable after
retiring.  
 The centuries-old sport is seeking to protect its 8.5
billion yen ($97 million) in annual tournament revenue and
repair a reputation already tarnished in recent years by
allegations of assault, trainee abuse and drug use. Companies
including  Fuji Xerox Co.  and  Nagatanien Co.  pulled their
sponsorship of this month’s tournament after 65 members of the
sport admitted to illegal gambling on baseball, mahjong and card
games.  
 Tokyo-based  NHK , which has broadcast the six annual sumo
tournaments since 1953, has said it may cancel coverage of the
15-day competition to begin July 11 unless the association takes
“sufficient” measures to address the gambling scandal.  
 Wrestlers, who are known by a single name, are organized in
stables managed by former wrestlers.
