             Rafael Nadal won his second Wimbledon
title and his eighth Grand Slam championship, defeating Tomas
Berdych 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.  
 Nadal, 24, from Spain, also won the Wimbledon title in
2008. He was unable to defend his crown last year because of
sore knees. Berdych, a 24-year-old Czech, was playing in his
first Grand Slam final.
