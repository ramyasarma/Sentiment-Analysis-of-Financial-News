             German stocks  climbed for the first
time in four days after the benchmark DAX Index traded near its
lowest level relative to earnings since 2008.  
 Infineon Technologies AG  surged 5.1 percent as BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research lifted its recommendation on the stock.
 ThyssenKrupp AG  and  Salzgitter AG , the country’s largest
steelmakers, followed an advance in European basic-resource
shares as metal prices increased.  SMA Solar Technology AG  and Q-
Cells SE led German solar companies higher.  
 The  DAX  rose 2.2 percent to 5,940.98, the biggest gain
since May. The gauge is still down 6.2 percent from its April 26
high on concern that the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
slowing growth in China and the U.S. will hurt German companies.
The broader  HDAX Index  increased 2.3 percent today.  
 The decline from this year’s high left the DAX valued at
about 14.5 times its companies’ reported earnings as of July 2,
near the lowest level since December 2008, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Infineon  climbed 5.1 percent to 5 euros after BofA Merrill
Lynch upgraded Europe’s second-largest semiconductor maker to
“neutral” from “underperform.”  
 The Semiconductor Industry Association said global chip
sales rose 4.5 percent in May from the previous month, helped by
higher demand for chips used in computers and mobile phones.  
 ThyssenKrupp rallied 4.7 percent to 21.16 euros, while
Salzgitter advanced 4.7 percent to 48.71 euros. Basic-resource
shares were the best performers in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
rising 5.1 percent as a group, as copper, lead and nickel all
climbed on the London Metal Exchange.  
 Carmakers Rally  
 Daimler AG , the world’s second-biggest maker of luxury
cars, led the surge in automotive stocks, rising 3.2 percent to
41.21 euros. MAN SE, Europe’s third-largest truckmaker, advanced
3.6 percent to 69.89 euros.  
 Volkswagen AG  increased 2 percent to 71.38 euros, while
 Porsche SE  jumped 3.6 percent to 34.96 euros. Volkswagen
appointed  Matthias Mueller , its top car-model strategist, as
chief executive officer of Porsche’s carmaking operations to
revive the division’s lineup of luxury vehicles in an
integration with Europe’s largest automaker.  
 SMA Solar jumped 16 percent to 98 euros after the maker of
solar-power equipment increased its 2010 sales and profit-margin
forecasts and the German parliament proposed an easing of
reductions in subsidies. The stock was raised to “buy” from
“hold” at Berenberg Bank.  
 Q-Cells advanced 7.1 percent to 5.65 euros, and  Solarworld
AG  climbed 6.4 percent to 10.44 euros. German lawmakers late
yesterday proposed easing reductions in solar-power subsidies
for three months and cleared the way for parliament to vote on
the cuts by July 9.
