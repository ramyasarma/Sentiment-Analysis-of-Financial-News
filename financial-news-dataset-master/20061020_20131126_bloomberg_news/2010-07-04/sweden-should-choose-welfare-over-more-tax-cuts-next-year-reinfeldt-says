             Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  said that his Moderate Party doesn’t plan any
additional tax cuts next year in order to safeguard public
finances and that tax increases won’t be necessary.  
 “We won’t promise any more tax cuts for 2011,” Reinfeldt,
who leads the government’s largest party, said yesterday in a
speech in Visby on the Swedish island of  Gotland . “The room for
reform that exists should be used for spending on the core of
welfare, on education and health care.”  
 The government has said it will spend 1.2 percent of  GDP 
this year to stimulate the economy ahead of parliamentary
elections on Sept. 19. The measures include a fourth round of
income tax cuts since coming to power in 2006, infrastructure
spending, benefits to families with children, and job measures.  
 Reinfeldt’s  government  has cut income tax by about 70
billion kronor ($9.2 billion), or 2.3 percent of  gross domestic
product , in four steps since coming to power in 2006. It has
also reduced payroll and corporate taxes and abolished a tax for
wealthy individuals. Earlier this year, Reinfeldt said he would
lower taxes for pensioners next year.  
 The opposition has pledged to spend at least 12 billion
kronor more on welfare in 2011 and 2012 than the government,
regardless of what Reinfeldt’s center-right coalition promises.  
 Recent polls suggest the four-party government alliance may
gain a second term in office after it lagged behind the three-
party opposition bloc in most surveys until the end of April.  
 A survey by Sentio Research published on July 2 showed 46.9
percent support for the government, compared with 45.8 percent
for the opposition. The Moderate Party had the biggest backing
with 31.8 percent compared with 30.8 percent for the Social
Democrats, the largest opposition party.  
 Second-Highest Taxes  
 Reinfeldt said his party still wants to cut taxes, once
public finances allow.  
 Swedes pay the second-highest taxes among the member-
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Total tax revenue was estimated at 47.1 percent of
Sweden’s economic output in 2008, second to Denmark’s, at 48.3
percent, according to the OECD.  
 Sweden has the European Union’s smallest budget deficit to
gross domestic product ratio at 0.5 percent in 2009, the
European Commission said on May 5. The economy shrank 5.1
percent last year -- the most since World War II -- as exports,
which make up about half of output, tumbled.  
 Finance Minister  Anders Borg  will publish new economic
forecasts tomorrow.
