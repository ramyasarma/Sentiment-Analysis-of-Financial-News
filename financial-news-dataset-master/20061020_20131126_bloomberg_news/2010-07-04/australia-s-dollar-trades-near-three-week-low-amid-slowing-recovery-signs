             The Australian dollar fell toward a
three-week low as economists expect the central bank to hold
borrowing costs unchanged for a second month on signs the global
economic recovery is slowing.  
 The New Zealand dollar dropped for a second day after U.S.
stocks fell July 2 and a report showed the world’s largest
economy lost jobs last month. A report tomorrow is forecast to
show U.S. service industries expanded at a slower pace. The
Reserve Bank of Australia will keep the benchmark interest rate
at 4.5 percent tomorrow, according to all 22 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Markets have become more concerned about the global
outlook,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. “With that kind of background,
it’s hard to see the Aussie and kiwi rallying or recovering.”  
 The Australian dollar fell to 83.82 U.S. cents as of 9:27
a.m. in Sydney from 84.16 in New York on July 2. It touched
83.16 cents on July 1, the lowest since June 10. The Aussie
dropped to 73.50 yen from 73.85 yen. It reached 72.69 yen on
July 1, the weakest level since May 25.  
 The New Zealand dollar declined to 68.57 U.S. cents from
68.84. It fell to 60.13 yen from 60.51 yen.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.5 percent at the end
of last week, declining for a fifth straight day. U.S. nonfarm
payrolls dropped last month by 125,000 positions, Labor
Department figures showed on July 2 in Washington.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which make up about 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 55 in June from 55.4 in May, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey ahead
of tomorrow’s report.  
 “We are cautious on the near-term outlook for the
Australian dollar given that global risk appetite remains
weak,”  Gareth Berry , a currency strategist in Singapore at UBS
AG, the world’s second-largest foreign-exchange trader, wrote in
a note today. “Furthermore, appreciation pressure on the Aussie
due to expectations of further rate hikes has also now
subsided.”
