             Australian border officials
intercepted a vessel off the nation’s northwest coast overnight
on suspicion it was attempting an “irregular entry” into the
country, Minister for Home Affairs  Brendan O’Connor  said.  
 The boat was carrying 34 passengers and two crew, who will
be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and
health checks, O’Connor said in an e-mailed statement today.
