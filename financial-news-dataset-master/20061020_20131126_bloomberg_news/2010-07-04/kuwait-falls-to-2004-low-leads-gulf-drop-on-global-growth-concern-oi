             Middle East shares fell, with Egypt’s
gauge dropping to the lowest since November, on concern weak
manufacturing data from the U.S. to China will slow the global
recovery. Oil lost 8.5 percent last week, pushing Gulf stocks
lower.  
 Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index  lost for an eighth day, decreasing 2.3
percent to 5,895.55, helped by  Pioneers Holding  after the
brokerage and Beltone Financial abandoned a plan to combine. The
 Kuwait SE Price Index  slid 1.7 percent to 6,320.6, the lowest
since November 2004.  Agility  fell 5.2 percent on investor
concern over the impact of a U.S. criminal case against the
Middle East’s largest storage and logistics company.  
 “Investors are moving away from risk appetite in line with
what’s happening with global markets” and as oil declines, said
Haissam Arabi, chief executive officer of Gulfmena Alternative
Investments in Dubai. “We expect more downside pressure.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid to a September low on
July 2 as a gauge of last month’s consumer confidence slumped to
a lower level than all projections in a Bloomberg News survey
and manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in a year. China’s
manufacturing growth slowed more than economists forecast, and a
gauge of factory output in the 16-member euro region weakened
for a second month, two surveys showed last week.  
 Crude dropped every day last week, to $72.14 a barrel on
July 2, the lowest settlement since June 8. The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council supplies about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 Pioneers Slides  
 Pioneers,  Egypt’s second-largest publicly traded brokerage,
dropped 4.8 percent to 3.34 Egyptian pounds, the lowest level on
record. The company and Beltone abandoned a plan to combine and
form an investment bank managing about $5 billion.  
 Ezz Steel, Egypt’s largest steel manufacturer, lost 3.6
percent to 16.94 pounds, the lowest level since Dec. 21. Al
Masry Al Youm reported steel companies will maintain July prices
for long steel at 3,550 Egyptian pounds ($625) per ton.  
 Agility lost to 275 fils, the lowest since 2003. The
company was indicted in November on allegations it overcharged
the U.S. government on a multibillion-dollar contract to supply
food for troops in Kuwait and Iraq.  
 “We continue to remain cautious on the stock into the
results,” said  Scott Darling , a Dubai-based analyst at Nomura
International Plc, citing the impact of the U.S. fraud
allegations on the company.  
 Al-Qabas reported today that Agility may post a first-half
profit of about 29.2 million dinars ($101 million), citing
people familiar with the matter. The company reported a profit
of 75 million dinars in the first half of last year, according
to Bloomberg data.  
 Abu Dhabi Gains  
 Bahrain’s  gauge  slipped 1.4 percent to 1,361.19, the lowest
since at least July 2004, when Bloomberg started tracking the
index. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index fell 0.5 percent.
Dubai’s  DFM General Index  declined 0.1 percent and Qatar’s  QE
Index   benchmark  decreased 1.2 percent.  
 Oman’s benchmark stock  index  gained 0.1 percent, Abu
Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  advanced 0.2 percent and Israel’s  TA-
25 Index  rose 0.5 percent.  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020 fell
0.20 shekel to 105.60. The yield on the 5 percent notes climbed
three basis points to 4.54 percent, rising from the lowest level
since they were issued. The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to
3.8905 per dollar on July 2.
