             Valemus Ltd. shares may price at the
lower end of the A$2.20 to A$2.50 range on July 8, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information. The initial public offering may be priced
more cheaply or scrapped if equity markets fall further or
investors don’t support the float, according to the newspaper.
Valemus said the IPO was on track to price within the target
range and won’t be cancelled, the report said.
