             Premier League soccer champion
Chelsea is ready to spend 100 million pounds ($152 million) to
bring Real Madrid’s Kaka and Liverpool’s Fernando Torres to
Stamford Bridge, the People reported.  
 Madrid may be prepared to sell Kaka, who played for current
Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti at AC Milan before both left the
Italian team a year ago, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 Chelsea will also make a similar bid of about 50 million
pounds for Torres, who may be ready to leave if Reds’ owners Tom
Hicks and George Gillett fail to sell the club, the People said.
