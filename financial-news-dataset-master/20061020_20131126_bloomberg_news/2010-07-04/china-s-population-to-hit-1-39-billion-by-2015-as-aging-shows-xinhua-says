             China’s population, which stood at
1.32 billion by 2008, may reach 1.39 billion by the end of 2015,
with more than 200 million people aged 60 or over, the state-run
Xinhua news agency reported late yesterday.  
 The urban population may exceed 700 million over the next
five years and for the first time surpass those living in rural
regions, the agency said, citing Li Bin, director of the
National Population and Family Planning Commission.
