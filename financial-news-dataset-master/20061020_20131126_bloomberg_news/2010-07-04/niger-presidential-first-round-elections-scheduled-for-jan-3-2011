             Niger will hold the first round of
presidential elections on Jan. 3, after last year’s military
coup, the Independent National Electoral Commission said.  
 A second round may be held Jan. 14 while the results will
be announced March 4, and the new president installed March 11,
Abdourhamane Gousmane, the president of the commission, said in
a speech yesterday.  
 Former president  Mamadou Tandja , who had ruled for 10
years, was deposed in the Feb. 18, 2009, coup after he sought to
extend his term by changing the constitution.  
 Niger produced about 7 percent of the global uranium supply
in 2008 and its share will increase to about 10 percent by 2015,
according to Macquarie Bank Ltd.
