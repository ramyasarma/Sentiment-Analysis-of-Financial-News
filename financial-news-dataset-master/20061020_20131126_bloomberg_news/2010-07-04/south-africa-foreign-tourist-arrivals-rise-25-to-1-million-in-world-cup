             South Africa’s foreign tourist
numbers grew by about a quarter to more than 1 million during
the FIFA Soccer World Cup, the country’s home affairs department
said.  
 The country recorded 1.02 million foreign visitors during
June 1 to July 1, up from 819,495 a year earlier, the department
said. “This figure is expected to rise further as the FIFA
World Cup enters the semi-finals and the final phases of the
tournament,” it said.  
 South Africa expects spending by tourists to contribute to
economic expansion this year. The economy, the biggest in
Africa, grew an annualized 4.6 percent in the first quarter and
the government expects it to grow 2.3 percent this year.
