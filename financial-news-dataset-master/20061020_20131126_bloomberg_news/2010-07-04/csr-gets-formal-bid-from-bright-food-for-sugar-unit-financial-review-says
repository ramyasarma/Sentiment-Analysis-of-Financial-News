             Bright Food Group Co., the biggest
food company in Shanghai, trimmed its offer for  CSR Ltd. ’s sugar
unit to between A$1.65 billion ($1.39 billion) and A$1.7
billion, the Australian Financial Review reported.  
 The Chinese company cut the price from its April 1
indicative offer of A$1.75 billion after the price of sugar
declined, the newspaper cited unidentified people close to the
deal as saying.  
 CSR directors are considering the bid that was received
July 2 and will update the market today, according to the
Review. CSR spokesman  Martin Cole  didn’t immediately respond to
phone messages seeking comment.  
 Bright Food would gain mills that produce 45 percent of
Australia’s raw sugar and account for about 4 percent of
international trade by buying CSR’s Sucrogen unit. CSR is also
considering separating the sugar business from its building
material and aluminum operations.  
 CSR  rose  1.5 percent to A$1.695 when last traded on July 2.
The company’s sugar division may also be a target for companies
such as  Bunge Ltd.  and Cargill Inc., RBS Equities (Australia)
Ltd. said in a report in January.
