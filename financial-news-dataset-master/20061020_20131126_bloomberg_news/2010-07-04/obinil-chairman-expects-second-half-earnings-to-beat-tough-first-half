             The Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services
expects earnings in the second half of the year to be better
than the first, Chairman Alex Shalaby said in an interview
today. The first half was “tough” because of price cuts among
mobile operators, he said. The Egyptian Co. operates under the
brand Mobinil.
