             New York’s John F. Kennedy
International Airport’s terminal 1 received a bomb threat today
from an anonymous woman and began evacuating people around 5:40
p.m. local time, CNN reported, citing an unidentified Port
Authority spokesman.  
 Authorities noticed an unattended piece of luggage at the
terminal prior to receiving the threat, according to the report.
The bag was examined and was found to be safe, CNN reported,
saying that the event may be over within the next hour.  
 A message left by Bloomberg News with a Port Authority 
operator wasn’t immediately returned.
