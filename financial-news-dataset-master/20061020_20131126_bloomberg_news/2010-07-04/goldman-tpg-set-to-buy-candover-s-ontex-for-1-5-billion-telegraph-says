             The private equity wing of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Capital are to buy diaper maker Ontex
from Candover Investments Plc for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5
billion), the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 The deal, which faltered when Goldman’s initial private
equity partner withdrew, may be announced as early as this week,
according to the newspaper. Ontex has about 60 percent of the
European market for non-label diapers, the Telegraph said.  
 Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Fiona Laffan declined to comment
on the report.
