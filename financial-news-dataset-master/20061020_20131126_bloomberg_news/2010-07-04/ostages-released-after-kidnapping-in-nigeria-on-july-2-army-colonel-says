             Nigerian gunmen released all 12
sailors taken hostage on July 2 in the Niger Delta, according to
Timothy Antigha, an army colonel and spokesman.  
 There is no information on the group responsible, Antigha
said by phone from the southern Nigerian city of Yenagoa. One
sailor shot in the foot is being treated in a hospital, he said.  
 Two German citizens kidnapped in Nigeria on July 2 were
freed, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Berlin said
today. Both sailors are in the care of Nigerian authorities and
are well, she said.  
 Attacks, including kidnapping for ransom and vandalism of
oil and gas facilities, occur in the Niger Delta, home of
Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. The government set up a joint
task force to check security in the oil-producing region.
Antigha is spokesman for that task force.
