             European Union carbon permits may
climb to 16 euros ($20.15) a metric ton after the contract for
delivery in December generated a so-called harami pattern on a
candlestick chart at the end of last week.  
 The contract formed a bullish harami pattern on a
candlestick chart on July 1,  Brett Genus , a London-based broker
for Evolution Markets Inc., said July 2 by phone. A bullish
harami, where the body of the candlestick is located within the
range of the previous day’s trading, can indicate a reversal
during a downtrend.  
 “This can be bullish for the market,” he said. “At some
stage we’ll be back up to 16 euros.” EU permits for December
traded above this level last month at 16.12 euros on London’s
European Climate Exchange on June 15 and at 16.04 euros on June
21, before falling back to close lower. Technical traders may
see this as a key pricing level.  
 The last time there was a harami formation on candlestick
charts was June 23, Genus said. There was some limited price
increase after this, he said.  
 European Union permits for December closed 0.7 percent
higher at 15.36 euros a ton on July 2. The contract traded as
low as 15.07 euros a ton last week before rising. It has not
closed below 15 euros since May 21, according to Bloomberg data.
Technical traders may see this as a pricing level which offers
resistance.  
 In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns to predict changes in prices.
