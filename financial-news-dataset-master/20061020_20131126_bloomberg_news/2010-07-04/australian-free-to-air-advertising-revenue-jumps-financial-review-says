             Advertising revenue on Australia’s
free-to-air television channels in capital cities climbed an
estimated 15 percent in the first half of the year and will keep
increasing in the current quarter, the Australian Financial
Review reported, citing Nine Network director of sales and
marketing Peter Wiltshire. Wiltshire expects a full-year growth
rate of about 13 percent, the newspaper said.
