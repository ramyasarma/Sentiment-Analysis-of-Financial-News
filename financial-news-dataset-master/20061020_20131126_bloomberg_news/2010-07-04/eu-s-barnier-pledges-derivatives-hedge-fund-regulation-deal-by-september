             Michel Barnier , the European Union
Financial Services Commissioner, pledged to toughen regulation
on financial derivatives, including credit default swaps and
naked short-selling.  
 “I never mentioned a ban, even though it’s an option on
which we are working on,” Barnier said today in an interview in
Aix-en-Provence, France. “We will consult, especially on naked
short-selling. It’s an option that we are studying with
seriousness. I want transparency, control and standardization.”  
 Barnier said the EU is “in the final stretch” before
voting on rules to regulate managers of hedge funds and private
equity firms. The accord should be reached in September when the
bloc’s Parliament and national governments are due to reach an
agreement, he said.  
 Barnier said European governments are still debating rules
for non-European parties. ”We are close to an agreement,” he
said.
