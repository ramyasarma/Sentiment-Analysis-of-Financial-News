             Confidence among chief financial
officers at major U.K. companies fell for a second quarter to a
12-month low on concern the economy will return to recession
amid the government’s budget squeeze, a survey by Deloitte LLP
found.  
 The balance of CFOs reporting greater optimism dropped to
24 percent from 40 percent in the previous quarter, London-based
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu said in an e-mailed statement today.
Finance chiefs see a 38 percent chance of a double-dip
recession, up from 33 percent in the first three months of 2010.
Even so, sentiment about the availability of credit rose to its
highest since Deloitte began its survey in 2007.  
 “The latest CFO survey paints a picture of concern about
growth coupled with improvements in the corporate credit and
liquidity environment,” Deloitte Chief Economist  Ian Stewart 
said in the statement.  
 Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government trimmed its
economic growth forecast for 2010 to 1.2 percent in last month’s
budget as it proposed spending cuts and tax increases totaling
113 billion pounds ($172 billion) to slash a  record deficit . The
government is demanding that state-owned banks boost credit to
businesses.  
 Deloitte surveyed 125 CFOs, including 32 from companies in
the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index , between June 11 and June 25.
