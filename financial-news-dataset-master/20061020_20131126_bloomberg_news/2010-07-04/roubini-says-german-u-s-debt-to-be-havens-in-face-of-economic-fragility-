             Nouriel Roubini, the New York
University economist credited with predicting the financial
crisis, said that government bonds of countries such as Germany,
Canada and the U.S. will represent a haven from increasingly
volatile markets in coming months.  
 “It is going to be a period of economic and financial
fragility,” Roubini said in an interview in Aix en Provence,
France. “The short-term and long-term debt of countries not yet
subject to sovereign debt concern will be havens,” he said.  
 The global economy will slow in the second half as deficit-
reduction measures, notably in Europe, sap demand, Roubini said.
U.S. growth will ease to about 1.5 percent by the end of 2010,
about half its potential, while the euro area’s expansion may
stall, he said. As a whole, the world should avoid a double-dip
recession, he said.  
 “The next few weeks and months will be a time of
volatility as the market surprises on the downside,” he said.
“It’s a pretty ugly picture. The macro news from the U.S.,
Europe, Japan and even China is disappointing. Credit spreads
will widen.”  
 Roubini spoke at a meeting of France’s Circle of
Economists.
