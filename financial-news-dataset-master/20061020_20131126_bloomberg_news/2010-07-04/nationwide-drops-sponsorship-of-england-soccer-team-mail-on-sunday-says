             Nationwide Building Society withdrew
its 20 million-pound ($30.4 million) sponsorship of England’s
soccer team after the country’s defeat in the World Cup, the
 Mail on Sunday  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  
 Nationwide had offered to extend its 11-year sponsorship of
the team before the contest began for four years, according to
the newspaper. England’s Football Association had preferred to
consider other options rather than commit to a new contract, the
Mail said.  
 No-one at Nationwide’s headquarters responded to telephone
calls by Bloomberg News today.
