             Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said he’ll call a lower house election before doubling the
nation’s sales tax to 10 percent to bolster finances.  
 “I will give the Japanese people an opportunity to make a
judgment,” if ruling and opposition parties reach a consensus
on raising the tax, Kan said on a Fuji Television program today.
“I won’t consider raising the tax without first holding an
election” for control of the more powerful lower house.  
 Kan has said doubling the sales tax would help pay rising
welfare costs for an aging population. His Democratic Party of
Japan urges cross-party talks on boosting the 5 percent levy, in
its platform for an upper house election next week.  
 The DPJ is fielding 106 candidates for 121 seats in the
July 11 contest, seeking to maintain Kan’s coalition majority in
the Diet’s  upper house . The  People’s New Party , a DPJ ally,
opposes the proposed tax increase.  
 PNP leader  Shizuka Kamei  criticized Kan’s stance on the
same TV program today, saying the DPJ shares a common goal with
the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party  on raising the tax.  
 The LDP, which held power almost continually from 1955
until its defeat by the DPJ last August, is fielding 84
candidates for the upper house.
