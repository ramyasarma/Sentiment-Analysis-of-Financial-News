             London’s transport authority plans to
build a cable car system spanning the River Thames that may be
ready in time for the city’s Olympic Games in 2012.  
 The project’s cost is an estimated 25 million pounds
($38 million) and would be capable of carrying as many as 2,500
passengers between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks every
hour,  Transport for London  said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 “Passengers would be able to drink in the truly
spectacular views of the Olympic Park and iconic London
landmarks,”  Boris Johnson , the city’s mayor, said in the
statement. “It would also provide a much needed enhancement of
cross river options to the east of the city.”  
 Cars departing at 30-second intervals would take five
minutes to ferry passengers between the O2 and ExCeL Olympic
venues, and travel at a height of about 50 metres (164 feet).  
 The consultation process for the project, to be financed
by private investment, opens tomorrow and closes Aug. 2,
according to Transport for London.
