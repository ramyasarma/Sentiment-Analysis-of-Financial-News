             Pioneers Holding , Egypt’s second-
largest publicly traded brokerage, and Beltone Financial
abandoned a plan to combine and form an investment bank managing
about $5 billion. Pioneers’ shares fell to the lowest on record.  
 “We decided not to do it,”  Aladdin Saba , chief executive
officer of the Cairo-based investment bank Beltone, said in a
telephone interview today, without elaborating. Pioneers
announced the decision in a regulatory filing.  
 The negotiations fell through because of the “lack of
agreement on future strategy,” said Osama Rashad, head of
investors relations at Beltone.  
 The merger would have combined Beltone’s assets under
management with Pioneers’ network of equity investors. Beltone
had 23.2 billion Egyptian pounds ($4 billion) of assets under
management in April, according to an e-mail today. The combined
entity would have competed with  EGF-Hermes Holding SAE , the
biggest publicly traded investment bank in Egypt.  
 “There were a lot of differences in culture between the
two companies,” said Walaa Hazem, vice president for asset
management at Cairo-based investment bank HC Securities &
Investment Co.  
 “ Beltone  was a model built for high-net-worth individuals
and institutions, and Pioneers was built for retail. At the end
of the day they couldn’t create a culture to serve both
entities,” he said by telephone.  
 Merger Plans  
 Pioneers  fell as much as 8.3 percent to 3.22 Egyptian
pounds, the lowest since its listing in June 2008, before
trimming losses to close at 3.34 pounds in Cairo. The shares
have slumped 47.4 percent this year. Beltone is listed on the
Egyptian Exchange, though its shares aren’t traded.  
 EFG-Hermes rose as much as 1.6 percent to 29.66 pounds
before dropping to 29.2 pounds. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30  stock
index fell 2.3 percent, extending the loss for 2010 to 5
percent.  
 Pioneers has no immediate plans to pursue another merger,
board member  Khaled El Tayeb  said in a televised interview with
Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television.  
 Shareholders of Beltone and Pioneers had approved the
merger. The new entity would have had 37 branches, 1,500
employees and 29 billion Egyptian pounds under management, Saba
said on Nov. 10.
