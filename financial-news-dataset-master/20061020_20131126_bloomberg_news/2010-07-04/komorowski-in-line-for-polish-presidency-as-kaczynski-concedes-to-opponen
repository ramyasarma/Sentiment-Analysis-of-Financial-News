             Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of
Poland’s biggest opposition party Law & Justice, conceded
victory in today’s presidential election to Bronislaw Komorowski
of the ruling Civic Platform Party, congratulating him at a
rally in Warsaw.  
 Komorowski leads Kaczynski 53.1 percent to 46.9 percent in
an exit poll by researcher TNS OBOP for public television. Exit
polls for two other television stations, TVN and Polsat, both
show Komorowski winning by a narrower margin of 51 percent to 49
percent, with a margin of error of 1 percentage point.
