             European Central Bank President  Jean- Claude Trichet  pressed governments to trim their budget
deficits, saying such action would boost economic growth by
improving confidence of consumers and investors.  
 “We are in a period where we have to manage budgets very
tightly,” Trichet told journalists in Aix-en-Provence, France.
“I have no problem with austerity, rigor. I call this good
budgetary management.”  
 The comments reinforce plans set out by Group of 20 leaders
last month in Toronto, where the countries representing 85
percent of the world economy responded to plans by European
governments to tackle the region’s sovereign debt crisis by
slashing budget deficits.  
 Advanced G-20 economies pledged June 27 to halve deficits
by 2013 and start to stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by
2016. While President Barack Obama is pushing his counterparts
to focus on spurring growth, leaders in the U.K. Germany, Spain
and Italy are already tightening spending to bolster investor
confidence.  
 Economists at Goldman Sachs Inc. and BNP Paribas SA have
trimmed their growth forecasts, partly in response to the
spending cuts and tax increases already announced. Trichet said
today that deficit reduction won’t choke growth and a failure to
stem budget gaps would be equally risky for the recovery.  
 “Confidence is key for growth, and if you cannot have
confidence in the sustainability of the fiscal policies then you
have no growth because you have no confidence,” he said. “The
two things are complimentary.”  
 Trichet urged European governments to boost growth through
structural changes and to publish results of stress tests on
banks as part of their efforts to boost confidence in the
financial system.  
 “Industrialized countries as a whole, on both sides of the
Atlantic and Japan have to reinforce their capacity to adapt to
an environment which is changing rapidly -- to embark on
structural reforms,” he said.
