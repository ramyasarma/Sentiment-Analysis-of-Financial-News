             China will maintain policy continuity
and flexibility to ensure “steady and relatively fast” growth
and to balance growth, management of inflation expectations and
economic restructuring, Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday after
a visit to businesses in southern Hunan province.  
 Policy makers face increasing “dilemmas” as the effects
of the global financial crisis become more severe than expected
and worldwide recovery increasingly “zigzags,” Wen was quoted
as saying in a statement on the government’s website today.
