             The Swiss National Bank is “closely
monitoring” increased fluctuation in the Swiss franc in recent
weeks, Blick reported, citing central bank President  Philipp Hildebrand .  
 A spokesperson at the central bank wasn’t available for
comment. Hildebrand’s remarks follow a recent appreciation of
the franc after the SNB ended attempts to counter gains. The
country’s central bank may have to consider further moves to
prop up the euro, according to economists and investors.  
 Intervention in currency markets to protect Switzerland’s
export-led recovery would boost the SNB’s record currency
holdings, leaving it vulnerable to losses as the euro weakens.
The central bank may have to run that risk as the franc climbs
against the euro on investor concern that the euro-area debt
crisis will worsen.  
 The risk of inflation in Switzerland is “extremely low”
and abundant liquidity can be absorbed in time, Hildebrand also
said in the interview published on  Blick ’s website. The central
bank is concerned about a possible property market bubble,
though there’s “no reason for panic,” he said.
