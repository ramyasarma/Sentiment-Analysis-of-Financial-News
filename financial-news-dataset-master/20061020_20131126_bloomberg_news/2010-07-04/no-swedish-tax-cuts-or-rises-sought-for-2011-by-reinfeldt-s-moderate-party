             Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  said that his Moderate Party doesn’t plan any tax cuts
in 2011 in order to safeguard public finances and that tax
increases won’t be necessary.  
 “There won’t be any tax relief for 2011,” Reinfeldt, who
leads the government’s largest party, said in a speech today in
Visby on the Swedish island of  Gotland . “Room for reforms will
be much worse during 2011.”  
 Reinfeldt said that any new spending next year would be
aimed at bolstering the welfare system.  
 The government has said it will spend 1.2 percent of  GDP 
this year to stimulate the economy ahead of parliamentary
elections on Sept. 19. The measures include a fourth round of
income tax cuts since coming to power in 2006, infrastructure
spending, benefits to families with children, and job measures.  
 Recent polls suggest the four-party government alliance may
gain a second term in office after it lagged behind the three-
party opposition bloc in most surveys until the end of April.  
 Reinfeldt’s  government  has cut income tax by about 70
billion kronor ($9.2 billion), or 2.3 percent of  gross domestic
product , in four steps since coming to power in 2006. It has
also reduced payroll and corporate taxes and abolished the
wealth tax.  
 Sweden should prioritize welfare spending over more tax
cuts and any new stimulus will only be put in place if public
finances allow for it, Reinfeldt said in an April 18 interview.  
 Sweden has the European Union’s smallest budget deficit to
gross domestic product ratio at 0.5 percent in 2009, the
European Commission said on May 5. This was even though the
economy shrank 5.1 percent last year -- the most since World War
II -- as exports, which make up about half of output, tumbled.  
 The government will publish new economic forecasts
tomorrow.
