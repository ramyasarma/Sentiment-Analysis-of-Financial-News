             Santos Ltd. might consider selling
some of its offshore Western Australian assets for up to A$1
billion, the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street
Talk column, without saying where it got the information. It may
use the proceeds from any sales to help fund its Gladstone
project in Queensland state, the newspaper said.
