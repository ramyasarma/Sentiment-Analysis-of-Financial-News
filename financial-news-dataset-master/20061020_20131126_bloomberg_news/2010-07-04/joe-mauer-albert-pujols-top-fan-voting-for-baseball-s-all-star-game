             Joe Mauer  and  Albert Pujols  topped
fan voting for Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game while
rookie pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  of the Washington Nationals
was left off the National League roster.  
 Mauer, a catcher for the Minnesota Twins and the American
League’s reigning Most Valuable Player, will make his fourth
appearance in the midseason exhibition. Pujols, a first baseman
for the St. Louis Cardinals, will play for the ninth time.  
 Fans cast 21.2 million votes to decide the nine AL and
eight NL starters, while 220 million ballots were cast overall,
MLB said on its website yesterday. Strasburg wasn’t among the
13 NL pitchers, eight of whom were chosen by players and five
by the Philadelphia Phillies’  Charlie Manuel , who’s managing
the team for the second straight year.  
 “He got quite a bit of consideration,” Manuel said in a
televised interview with TBS. “He’s going to be an All-Star
for a long time. I just felt like there’s other guys who have
started anywhere from 18 to 20 games.”  
 Strasburg, whose fastball tops 100 miles (161 kilometers)
per hour, has made six starts since being called up from the
minor leagues and is 2-2 with a 2.45 earned run average. He
struck out a record 41 batters in his first four games and has
53 strikeouts overall and 10 walks in 36 2/3 innings.  
 The 81st All-Star Game will be held July 13 at Angel
Stadium in Anaheim, California.  
 At stake is home-field advantage in the World Series.  
 AL’s Streak  
 Since 2003, the team from the winning league gains the
right to host as many as four games in the best-of-seven
championship matchup. The AL last year extended its unbeaten
All-Star Game streak to 13 years with a 4-3 victory at Busch
Stadium in St. Louis.  
 Mauer got 5.37 million votes, the third-most ever after
the 6.08 million cast for  Ken Griffey Jr . in 1994 and the 5.4
million received by Pujols last year.  
 Mauer is the second Twins player after Hall of Famer Rod
Carew in 1975 to lead the voting, and the first catcher to top
the balloting since Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers 10
years ago. The 30-year-old Pujols got the most votes among NL
players for the fourth time, with a tally of 4.38 million.  
 Mauer is joined in the AL starting lineup by Twins first
baseman  Justin Morneau , while the NL starters also include
Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina.  
 All-Star Starters  
 The other AL starters as voted for by fans are: second
baseman  Robinson Cano  (Yankees); shortstop  Derek Jeter 
(Yankees); third baseman  Evan Longoria  (Tampa Bay Rays);
outfielders  Josh Hamilton  (Texas Rangers),  Ichiro Suzuki 
(Seattle Mariners) and Carl Crawford (Rays), and designated
hitter  Vladimir Guerrero  (Rangers).  
 The other NL starters are: second baseman  Chase Utley ,
(Philadelphia Phillies); shortstop  Hanley Ramirez  (Florida
Marlins); third baseman David Wright (New York Mets), and
outfielders  Ryan Braun  (Milwaukee Brewers),  Andre Ethier  (Los
Angeles Dodgers) and  Jason Heyward  (Atlanta Braves).  
 Utley won’t be able to make a fifth appearance in the All-
Star Game after undergoing thumb surgery July 1. He’ll be
replaced by  Martin Prado , second baseman for the Atlanta
Braves. Manuel will select the team’s designated hitter.  
 Final Roster Spot  
 The last player on each team will be determined via an
online vote by fans at MLB.com, with the winners revealed after
balloting ends on July 8.  
 Each league has five contenders for the remaining place on
their rosters. In the AL, fans can choose from  Paul Konerko 
(Chicago White Sox),  Nick Swisher  (Yankees),  Kevin Youkilis 
(Red Sox), Delmon Young (Twins) and  Michael Young  (Rangers).  
 Strasburg wasn’t among the five possible NL players
selected by Manuel for the voting. The NL finalists are  Heath Bell  (San Diego Padres), Carlos Gonzalez (Colorado Rockies),
 Joey Votto  (Cincinnati Reds),  Billy Wagner  (Braves) and  Ryan Zimmerman  (Nationals).
