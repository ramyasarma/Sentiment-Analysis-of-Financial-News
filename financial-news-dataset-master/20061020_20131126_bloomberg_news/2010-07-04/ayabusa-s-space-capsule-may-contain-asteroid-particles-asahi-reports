             A Japanese space capsule that
returned to earth last month may have succeeded in its mission
to collect a sample from an asteroid, the Asahi newspaper said.  
 The capsule, which was part of the Hayabusa mission, may
contain particles from the Itokawa asteroid, the report said,
citing unidentified people at the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency.
