             Apax Partners LP faces hundreds of
millions of pounds in losses as banks are likely to take over
its struggling Truvo European directory business and Panrico
bakery in Spain in coming weeks, the  Sunday Times  reported.  
 The appropriation will come after Truvo and Panrico failed
to repay debt and will wipe out about 250 million pounds ($380
million) from the private equity firm’s book, the Times
reported, without saying how it got the information.  
 Truvo is co-owned with Cinven Ltd., the paper said.
