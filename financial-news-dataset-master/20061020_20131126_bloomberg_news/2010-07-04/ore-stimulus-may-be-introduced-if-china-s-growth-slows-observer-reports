             The Chinese government may rashly
introduce more stimulus measures if second-quarter economic
indicators show a decline, Economic Observer cited Yin
Zhongqing, vice chairman of the National People’s Congress’s
finance committee, as saying.  
 Yin said he was worried about overstimulating the economy,
the Observer said.
