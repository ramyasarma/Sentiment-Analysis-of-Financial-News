             Miguel Angel Jimenez won a three-man
playoff to take golf’s French Open today. Francesco Molinari of
Italy was second and Jimenez’s Spanish compatriot Alejandro
Canizares third.  
 Jimenez, 46, won with a par-four at the first extra hole,
while Molinari got a bogey and Canizares took a seven after
twice hitting into a lake at Le Golf National near Paris. The
three had tied on 11 under par.  
 Jiminez had made a final-round 67, 4-under par, after
hitting into the lake on the final regulation hole for a double
bogey. He’d gone into that hole with a two-shot lead.  
 He picked up a check for 500,000 euros ($627,000), which
puts him fifth in the Ryder Cup standings.
