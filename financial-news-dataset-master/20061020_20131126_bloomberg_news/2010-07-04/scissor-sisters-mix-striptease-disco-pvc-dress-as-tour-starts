             The chief weapons of the Scissor
Sisters are sexy disco, X-rated outfits and twisted lyrics.  
 A new album, out last week, comes hot on the heels of the
first dates of a global tour bringing zany club culture to a
stage near you all too soon.  
 The band’s mission is to win over the world, with large
parts of Europe already under the spell of its good-time glamour
and only its U.S. homeland waiting to be conquered.  
 Judging by the opening shows, it’s not so certain the
Sisters will succeed in going mainstream. In the past, camp
outrage has been too much for some parts of America. Eyebrows
are raised over the lead singers: Ana Matronic’s erotic moves
and Jake Shears’s readiness to let his clothes fall off.  
 This time around, the Sisters are pretending to be a real
rock band. Trouble is, that by casting aside the usual party
paraphernalia, they are throwing away the “must see” status.  
 Previously the riotous music was matched by stage costumes
to make (sometime collaborator)  Elton John  seem like a wall
flower. For the London opening concert at the O2 Academy
Brixton, the band was dressed in serious black and Matronic’s
PVC dress was knee length.  
 Shears at least has spray-on jeans and outdoes “Bruno” in
the finale. His posterior-airing blue and orange outfit, a cross
between a mankini and lederhosen, would cause riots in some
states. (For his Glastonbury appearance, he was a little more
glamorous, wearing a snug outfit with strategic rips. The band 
was joined by  Kylie Minogue  for “Any Which Way.”)  
 The music matches the new image. Old favorites like
“Laura” acquire a new edge that is not entirely becoming.
Disco beats are weighed down with faux rock gravitas. The high
pitched vocals lack the helium high-jinks of their  Bee Gees 
inspiration.  
 Floyd Cover  
 Endure this, and you also find moments of excellence. The
screamingly disco cover of  Pink Floyd’s  “Comfortably Numb” is
still a work of wayward genius. “Take Your Mama Out” remains a
touchingly personal and gloriously inclusive gay pop anthem.  
 Then it’s back to a glut of unknown songs from the  new
album , all poorly played and with even worse guitar solos
(although they may improve with practice).  
 “Harder You Get”, devoid of the filth present on its
recorded version, becomes dangerously like Dire Straits
(although thankfully, unlike Shears,  Mark Knopfler  is not known
for taking his top off mid-song). When the middle-eight of
“Whole New Way” accidentally reveals its debt to  Michael Jackson’s  “Billie Jean,” the comparison is especially
unfortunate.  
 The Scissor Sisters foursome can be magnificent party
animals. As a rock band, theyre simply dull.  
 Rating: ** at best.  
 The Scissor Sisters tour includes festivals in Sweden,
Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan.  
 The album “Night Work” is out on Polydor/ Universal
priced from $10 or 8 pounds. Download fees vary across services.
