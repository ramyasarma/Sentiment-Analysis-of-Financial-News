             Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of generic drugs, won U.S. clearance to
sell the first lower-cost copy of  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) 's cancer drug
Camptosar.  
 The Food and Drug Administration gave final approval to
Watson's generic irinotecan hydrochloride after patents on the
brand-name drug expired, according to a  notice  posted today on
the agency's Web site. The Corona, California-based company said
yesterday that it is entitled to 180 days of market exclusivity
under U.S. law before the FDA can approve another generic.  
 Getting a generic on the market first is important because
prices generally fall as competition increases. Camptosar,
approved by the FDA in 1996, brought in $539 million in U.S.
sales for New York-based Pfizer last year. The product is an
 injectable medicine  used to treat colon or rectal cancer that has
spread to other parts of the body. Doctors often administer it
with other cancer treatments.  
 Watson ranks second among U.S. generic drugmakers by sales,
after  Mylan Inc. (MYL) , according to data compiled by research firm IMS
Health Inc.  
 Watson fell 95 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $27.26 at 4:05 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
