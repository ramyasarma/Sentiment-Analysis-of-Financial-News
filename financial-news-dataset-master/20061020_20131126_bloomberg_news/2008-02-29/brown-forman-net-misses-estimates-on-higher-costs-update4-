             Brown-Forman Corp. (BF/B) , the maker of Jack
Daniel's whiskey, said third-quarter  profit  rose less than
analysts projected as grain costs climbed and sales of Southern
Comfort liqueur slowed.  
 The stock fell the most in two weeks as the maker of spirits
and wine narrowed the range of its full-year earnings forecast.  
 Higher sales of Jack Daniel's bourbon and Finlandia vodka were
damped by declining purchases of Southern Comfort after the company
raised prices in a slowing economy. Brown-Forman's gross margin,
the share of sales after subtracting the cost of goods sold,
narrowed 2 percentage points, mostly on grain used for distilling.  
 ``The price of corn and wheat and other agricultural
commodities have really just been increasing at a substantially
higher rate than we had guessed,'' Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst
with UBS Securities LLC in  New York , said in a research note.
``It's going to be the thing to watch for the next year or so.''  
 The company's Class B  shares  fell $2.30, or 3.5 percent, to
$63.77 at 4:16 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading ,
the most since Feb. 13. They've dropped 14 percent this year.  
 Net income climbed 10 percent to $116 million, or 94 cents a
share, the Louisville, Kentucky-based company said today in a
statement. The average estimate of six  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg was for third-quarter earnings of 99 cents a share.  
 Sales increased 16 percent to $877.4 million including
excise taxes in the three months through January, missing the
$879.2 million average estimate of analysts.  
 Rising Grain Prices  
 Brown-Forman narrowed its full-year profit forecast to $3.42
to $3.50 a share, from $3.42 to $3.54.  
 Rising grain prices have cost Brown-Forman an additional $7
million since May and will total about $10 million for the
company by April, Chief Financial Officer Phoebe Wood said on a
conference call.  
 Southern Comfort wholesale shipments to retailers declined
by a ``low-single'' digit percentage globally, Wood said.  
 U.S. sales of Jack Daniel's on a volume basis, which
declined in the second quarter, rose by a ``low-single'' digit
percentage during the third quarter. International volume sales
of the bourbon, the company's biggest selling product, advanced
by a ``mid-single'' digit, Brown-Forman said.  
 ``Slower international trends are giving less offset to a
weakened U.S.,'' Andrew Sawyer, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &
Co. in New York, said in a research note. He recommended selling
the stock, citing ``weak fundamentals over the immediate term.''  
 Spirits accounted for 86 percent of the company's 2007
revenue.  
 Advertising Spending  
 Operating income in the quarter rose 8 percent. The company
boosted advertising spending 14 percent to $108 million.  
 ``They have been able to show decent growth in  North America 
with operating income while still investing in the business,''
 Thomas Russo , a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster,
 Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview.  
 Brown-Forman repurchased $122 million of its shares in the
quarter, nearly completing $200 million in buybacks authorized in
November, Wood said during the conference call.  
 Liquor sales in the U.S. climbed 5.6 percent to $18.2
billion last year, the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. said
last month. Sales growth may slow to 4.6 percent this year, which
would be the smallest gain since 2001, the group said.
