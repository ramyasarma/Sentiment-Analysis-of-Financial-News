             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , the world's
largest iron-ore producer, said fourth-quarter profit rose 64
percent on higher iron-ore prices and increased nickel output
after last year's acquisition of Inco Ltd.  
 Net income rose to $2.57 billion, or 52 cents a share, from
$1.57 billion a year earlier, Rio de Janeiro-based Vale said
today in a statement posted on the Brazilian securities
regulator's Web site. Vale didn't provide year-earlier per-share
figures. Sales rose 12 percent to $8.16 billion.  
 Vale completed its $16.7 billion acquisition of Inco in
January 2007, becoming the world's second-largest nickel
producer. The increased production offset a 6.6 percent average
nickel price drop during the quarter.  
 ``Strong growth in 2007, both organic and through
acquisitions, has combined with a generally favorable moment for
the prices of the commodities that it produces,'' Max Bueno, an
analyst at Spinelli SA in  Sao Paulo , said before the results were
released. ``Prices remain at historically high levels.''  
 The results are based on generally accepted U.S. accounting
principles.  
 Analyst Estimates  
 The results beat some analysts' estimates. Gary Lampard, an
analyst with Canaccord Adams, said yesterday he expected net
income to climb to $2.1 billion. Bernardo Lobao, a steel and
mining analyst with ARX Capital Management in Rio, estimated
profit of $2.45 billion.  
 In the fourth quarter of 2006, Vale had higher costs as part
of its acquisition of Inco, depressing profit, said Rodrigo Ferraz, an analyst with Banco Brascan SA in Rio de Janeiro.  
 ``That's why profit at that moment was low,'' he said.  
 Iron-ore production, which accounts for almost half of
Vale's revenue, grew 15 percent from a year earlier to 78.2
million metric tons, Vale said in a Feb. 15 report. Nickel output
grew 5.8 percent to 69,000 metric tons.  
 Based on Brazilian accounting standards, consolidated  net
income  rose 31 percent to 4.41 billion reais, or 91 centavos a
share, from 3.37 billion reais, or 70 centavos, a year earlier.
Net sales fell 7.6 percent to 15.1 billion reais, according to
Brazilian standards.  
 Ferraz had forecast profit to rise to 4.2 billion reais.  
 Vale preferred shares rose 1.15 reais, or 2.2 percent, to
52.50 reais in Sao Paulo trading, the highest close since
December 10. The stock has gained 3.5 percent this year, compared
with a 2.6 percent gain for the benchmark Bovespa index.
