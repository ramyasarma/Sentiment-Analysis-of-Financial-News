             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, negotiating
the world's biggest-ever mining takeover, said obstacles to a
deal remain and that the largest shareholder of target company
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  is now the ``key'' to negotiations.  
 While Xstrata would be a ``nice fit,'' there are limits to
what Rio de Janeiro-based Vale is able to pay, Chief Executive
Officer  Roger Agnelli  said today in a conference call. Zug,
Switzerland-based Xstrata was valued at 38.7 billion pounds ($77
billion), based on the company's current share price.  
 ``We have principles we will not abandon,'' Agnelli said.
``Vale doesn't need Xstrata to move ahead.''  
 Vale confirmed in January that it was in talks to buy
Xstrata as the Brazilian company seeks to challenge BHP Billiton
Ltd. as the world's biggest mining company. Talks ended this week
after Glencore International AG, which owns 34 percent of
Xstrata, demanded an extension of its agreement to sell
commodities that Xstrata produces such as coal and nickel, the
Financial Times reported.  
 Agnelli's comments indicate that Vale isn't willing to make
the acquisition at any cost, said Jorge Simino, head of Fundacao
Cesp, the pension fund of  Sao Paulo 's state-owned utility.  
 `Life or Death'  
 ``It's not a life or death situation to buy, buy, buy,''
said Simino, who oversees 14.4 billion reais ($8.51 billion) in
assets, including Vale shares. ``A lot of the share gains in the
past few years have had to do with organic growth and price
increases.''  
 Vale's preferred shares fell 2.06 reais, or 3.9 percent, to
50.44 reais at 5 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. A close at that price
would be the biggest one-day drop since Jan. 24. Vale's shares
have gained 61 percent in the past year.  
 Vale offered 45 U.K. pounds ($89.35) a share for Xstrata,
after starting talks last year, the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Agnelli said today that Vale isn't negotiating rights to
sell  iron ore .  
 ``We have limits,'' Agnelli said at a press conference in
 Rio de Janeiro . ``Fundamentally, they are prices, but there are
also business-strategy limits.''  
 Agnelli ``is sending a message to Glencore that Vale won't
give in to pressure,'' Eduardo Puzziello, an equity analyst at
Fator Corretora, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. He
rates Vale shares ``attractive.''  
 Glencore spokesman  Marc Ocskay  declined to comment when
contacted by phone today in Baar,  Switzerland . Xstrata
spokeswoman  Claire Divver  also declined to comment.
