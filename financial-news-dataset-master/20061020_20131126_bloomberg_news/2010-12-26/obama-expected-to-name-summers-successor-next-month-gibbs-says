A successor to  National Economic
Council  Director  Lawrence Summers  will probably be named next
month, White House press secretary  Robert Gibbs  said today.  Summers is keeping his position through the end of the
year, and President  Barack Obama  wanted to “take some time to
make a good decision,” Gibbs said on CNN’s “State of the
Union” program. “It’s an important part of our economic
team.”  Obama announced in September that Summers, 56, would return
to Harvard University, where he served as president from 2001 to
2006. He was Treasury secretary during President  Bill Clinton ’s
administration.  Possible candidates to succeed Summers include  Roger Altman , founder of Evercore Partners Inc.;  Gene Sperling , an
adviser to Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner ; and Yale
University President  Richard Levin .  Gibbs said he didn’t expect other major personnel changes.  “We’ve had a very capable and good cabinet that has helped
move the president’s agenda forward,” he told CNN. “We have a
very talented team.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
