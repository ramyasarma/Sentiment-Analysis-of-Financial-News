South Korea will cooperate with
Myanmar to develop mineral resources including rare-earth
minerals as it seeks to secure supplies amid rising raw material
prices.  The two countries agreed to conduct a geological study and
develop projects, South Korea’s  Ministry of Knowledge Economy 
said in a statement today.  South Korea, which imports almost all its energy and
minerals needs, is increasing spending on resources projects to
line up supplies.  Vice Minister Park Young June asked Myanmar, during his Dec.
23 visit, to let South Korean companies explore for oil and gas
onshore, which is currently prohibited to foreign companies, the
ministry said.  A group of companies led by South Korean trading house
 Daewoo International Corp. , is developing gas resources in
Myanmar’s A1 and A3 offshore blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
