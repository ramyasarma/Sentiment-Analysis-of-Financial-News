Moscow’s Domodedovo airport won’t
return to full operation until Monday morning even after some
departures and arrivals resumed following a power outage, state-
run Vesti-24 said, without citing anyone for the information.  Thirteen flights have left the airport today,  Alexander Neradko , the head of Russia’s transport agency said.  A handful of long-haul domestic flights landed and a few
flights were allowed to take-off for which passengers had
cleared boarding procedures earlier in the day, Elena Galanova a
spokeswoman for the airport said by telephone.  Domodedovo, operating on its own generators, remains
without external power after freezing rain caused a failure in
utilities that supply the airport, she said.  The inclement weather has caused delays to 150 flights,
Galanova said.  Incoming flights are being diverted to Moscow’s
Sheremetyevo airport causing some delays, Vesti-24 said.
Thousands of passengers have been stranded, Vesti-24 said,
without citing anyone.  The power outage has left about 300,000 people in the
Moscow region without electricity in near freezing temperatures,
according to the Russian Emergency Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
