Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, owner of
the Subaru auto brand, hasn’t halted sales or development of
electric vehicles, spokesman Fusao Watanabe said by phone from
Tokyo today.  The Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier that the automaker
will suspend sales of plug-in electric vehicles for as long as
five years because of a scarcity of charging facilities and the
price of lithium-ion batteries, citing the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
