IGate Corp. , backed by Apax Partners
LLP, may buy 60 percent of India’s  Patni Computer Systems Ltd. 
after the Mumbai-based company’s founders decided not to accept
a rival bid from Carlyle Group, the Economic Times reported,
without saying where it got the information from.  The deal may be valued at more than $1 billion, according
to the report.  Patni doesn’t comment on market speculation, the company
said in an e-mail sent by an external public relations agency.
 Dorothy Lee , a Hong Kong-based Carlyle spokeswoman, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. IGate Chief Executive
Officer  Phaneesh Murthy  also didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
