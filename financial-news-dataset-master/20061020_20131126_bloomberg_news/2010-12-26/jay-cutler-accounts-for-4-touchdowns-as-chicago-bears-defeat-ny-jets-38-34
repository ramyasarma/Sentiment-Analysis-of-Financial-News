Jay Cutler threw three scoring
passes and ran for another touchdown as the Chicago Bears
prevented the New York Jets from clinching a playoff spot,
defeating the Jets 38-34 today in Chicago.  The Bears (11-4), who already have clinched a playoff spot,
trailed 21-10 midway through the second quarter before Cutler
led a comeback that included two scoring passes to Johnny Knox.  Jets (10-5) quarterback Mark Sanchez, who was limited in
practice this week because of a shoulder injury, threw for 269
yards -- including a touchdown pass and a late interception.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
