Canada’s opposition leader told the
CTV television network that he’s prepared to vote out the ruling
Conservative government and force an election if he doesn’t like
the forthcoming budget.  “We’ve made it clear their corporate tax-cut agenda is not
ours,”  Michael Ignatieff , leader of the Liberal Party, told
CTV’s “Question Period” program. “We’ll have to make a
decision when I get to the budget.”  The Conservatives hold a minority of seats in the House of
Commons and could be forced into an election by a coordinated
effort of the three opposition parties; the Liberals, the Bloc
Quebecois and the New Democratic Party. Canada’s fiscal year
ends March 31.  John Baird , Conservative leader in the House of Commons,
said his government will neither force an election nor back away
from plans to shrink the country’s budget deficit.  “We won’t see the kind of money the Bloc and NDP and
Liberals want us to be spending,” he said in a separate
“Question Period” interview. “We’re prepared to get that
deficit down and are on track to get a balanced budget by 2015-
ish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
