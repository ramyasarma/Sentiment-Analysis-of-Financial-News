Jay Feely  kicked a 48-yard field
goal with five seconds remaining to help the Arizona Cardinals
beat the Dallas Cowboys 27-26 in their National Football League
game last night in Glendale, Arizona.  Rookie quarterback  John Skelton  completed throws of 26 and
19 yards on the way to the winning kick. Skelton connected on 11
of 25 passes for 183 yards and a touchdown in the game.  The Cardinals outlasted a Dallas rally that erased an 18-
point deficit. The Cowboys took a 26-24 lead after quarterback
 Stephen McGee  threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to  Miles Austin 
with 1:47 to play. Kicker  David Buehler  missed an extra point
attempt that would have given the Cowboys a three-point edge.  McGee played after John Kitna, who had two interceptions
returned for touchdowns in the first quarter, left the game
before halftime with a hip injury. McGee completed 11 of 17
passes for 111 yards and a touchdown in the loss.  Arizona improved to 5-10 with the win. The Cowboys fell to
5-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
