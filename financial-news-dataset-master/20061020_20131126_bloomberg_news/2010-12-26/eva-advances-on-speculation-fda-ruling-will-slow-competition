Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
climbed the most in more than two weeks on speculation failure
by the company to win U.S. approval for a new formulation of its
multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone means it will be more difficult
for competitors to enter the market.  The  shares  of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
increased 2.9 percent, the biggest gain since Dec. 9, to 187.70
shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The stock has lost
12 percent  this year .  Teva received a complete response letter from the Food and
Drug Administration saying the company’s application for the new
formulation of Copaxone with a higher concentration of medicine
can’t be approved as submitted and may require a new study to
prove it works, the company said Dec. 23.  “Given that the FDA is requiring clinical trial efficacy
data from the originator because of a concentration change, the
likelihood of the FDA requiring clinical trials for generics is
even higher,”  John Boris , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New
York, wrote in a Dec. 23 report.  About 19 percent of Teva’s sales come from Copaxone, an
inject-able drug that faces new competition after the FDA in
September approved the first pill for multiple sclerosis,
 Novartis AG ’s Gilenya. The FDA’s letter “supports Teva’s belief
that even slight changes to a glatiramoid like Copaxone can
significantly and unpredictably influence the efficacy, toxicity
and immunogenicity profile of the compound,” the Petah Tikva,
Israel-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
