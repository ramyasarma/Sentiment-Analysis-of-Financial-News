A series of earthquake aftershocks
rattled New Zealand’s second-largest city Christchurch this
morning, causing some damage to buildings, police said.  Most of the damage, which included falling masonry and
broken glass, was the result of a  4.9 magnitude  tremor recorded
at 10:30 a.m. local time, Stephen Hill, a spokesman for
Christchurch police, said in a phone interview today.  The Christchurch area has been dealing with aftershocks
since a 7.0 earthquake on Sept. 4 damaged more than 100,000
homes, broke water and sewage lines and caused about NZ$4
billion damage ($3 billion). It was the worst quake in New
Zealand in 80 years.  Today’s damage occurred in a small area of the central
business district, with commercial and retail buildings
affected, Hill said. Police cordoned off part of the business
district as a precaution. No injuries were reported, he said.  Three aftershocks, with magnitudes between 3.7 and 4.2 were
also recorded between 2:07 a.m. and 2:32 a.m. today, Hill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
