Indian investigators questioned
 Andimuthu Raja,  the former telecommunications minister, for a
second day as part of a probe into the allocation of mobile-
phone airwaves, Press Trust of India reported.  The Central Bureau of Investigation questioned Raja in New
Delhi and asked him about the allocation of spectrum and the
possible involvement of his relatives in some companies, PTI
reported yesterday, citing officials it didn’t identify.  On Dec. 8, the federal police searched the homes of Raja,
who is at the center of a probe into a multibillion-dollar
auction of mobile-phone licenses in 2008. Raja has denied any
wrongdoing.  No one was available to comment today outside regular
working hours when Bloomberg News contacted Raja’s New Delhi
residence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
