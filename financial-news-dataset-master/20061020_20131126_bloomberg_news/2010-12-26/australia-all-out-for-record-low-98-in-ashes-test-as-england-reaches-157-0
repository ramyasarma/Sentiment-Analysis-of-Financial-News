England dominated the first day of
the fourth Ashes cricket Test in Melbourne, bowling out
Australia for 98 then reaching 157 without loss in reply.  Alastair Cook  hit 80 and captain  Andrew Strauss  made 59 in
an unbeaten opening stand to back up the bowlers’ efforts in
dismissing Australia for its lowest first-innings total in elite
Tests at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  “It was an interesting day,” England fast bowler  James Anderson , who took four wickets, told the British Broadcasting
Corp. “It was the right decision to bowl first, obviously.”  England, which would retain the Ashes by winning at the
MCG, leads by 59 runs with all 10 first-innings wickets in hand
after Strauss won the toss and chose to bowl first. The best-of-
five contest is tied at 1-1 following Australia’s 267-run win in
Perth eight days ago.  The tourists recovered from dropping two catches in the
opening three overs to remove the Australians in 42.5 overs.
 Chris Tremlett  claimed 4-26 and Anderson took 4-44, while
wicketkeeper  Matt Prior  took a career-best six catches behind
the stumps.  Tim Bresnan , playing his first match of the series after
replacing Steven Finn, got the other two wickets, while spinner
 Graeme Swann  bowled only two overs.  Michael Clarke  top-scored for the home team with 20. It was
the second time this year Australia scored less than 100 in a
Test innings, following its 88 in July against Pakistan in
Leeds, England.  Michael Hussey , who had scored 517 runs in the first three
Tests, was dismissed yesterday for eight runs when he edged to
Prior off Anderson.  “When he has over 500 runs in three games it’s quite a big
wicket for the team,” Anderson said. “We were pretty delighted
with our bowling performance.”  As Ashes holder, England would keep the trophy by tying the
series. The English last successfully retained the Ashes in
1986-87, when  Mike Gatting ’s team secured a 2-1 win in
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
