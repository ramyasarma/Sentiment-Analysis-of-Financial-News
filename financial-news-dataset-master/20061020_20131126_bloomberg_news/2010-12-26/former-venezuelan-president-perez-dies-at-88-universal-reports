Former Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez died today of “respiratory arrest” in Miami,  El
Universal  reported, citing his daughter Maria Francia Perez. He
was 88.  Perez, as part of the Accion Democratica Party, served as
president of Venezuela in the 1970s during an oil boom and again
from 1989 until 1993. In his second term, Perez was beset by
corruption scandals, economic hardship that led to riots known
as the Caracazo and a coup attempt by now-President  Hugo Chavez ,
the Caracas-based daily El Universal said.  Venezuela’s highest court forced Perez to step down in
1993, one year before the end of his term, on charges of
corruption and illicit enrichment, El Universal reported.  Perez, born in the Andean state of Tachira, suffered a
cardiovascular attack in 2003 that paralyzed a hand, an arm and
his right side, El Universal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
