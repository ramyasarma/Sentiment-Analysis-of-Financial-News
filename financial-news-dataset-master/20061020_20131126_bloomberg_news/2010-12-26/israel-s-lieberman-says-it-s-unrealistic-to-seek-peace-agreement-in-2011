Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor
Lieberman said a peace agreement with the Palestinians under
current conditions is not possible and any attempts to reach a
deal in the coming year are “unrealistic.”  “Even if we offered the Palestinians Tel Aviv,” they
would find a way not to accept a peace deal with Israel,
Lieberman told an Israeli diplomatic gathering in remarks later
broadcast on Channel 2 television.  The foreign minister also said Israel would not apologize
to Turkey for its May 31 naval raid on a Gaza Strip-bound
flotilla during which nine of its citizens were killed, and
criticized what he called the “lies” of the Turkish
government.  The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later
released a statement saying Lieberman’s remarks represented his
personal views and not the policies of the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
