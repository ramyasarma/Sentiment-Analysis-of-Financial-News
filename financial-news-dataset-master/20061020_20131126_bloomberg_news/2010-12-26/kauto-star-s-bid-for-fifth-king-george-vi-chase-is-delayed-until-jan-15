Kauto Star ’s bid to record a fifth
straight victory in horse racing’s King George VI Chase will be
delayed until Jan. 15 after frost and snow forced Kempton Park
to cancel its Winter Festival.  The three-mile race, one of the biggest in the U.K. jumps
calendar, was scheduled to take place today at the course, which
is situated near London, as part of a two-day meeting.  “We are naturally bitterly disappointed to have lost the
William Hill Winter Festival to the severe winter weather,”
Kempton Park’s Managing Director Amy Starkey said in a  statement 
on the course’s website. “Everyone at the racecourse did all
that they could to get racing on, but the elements defeated
us.”  Kauto Star’s racing career may draw to a close at the end
of the season should the horse win the King George and the
Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, owner Clive Smith has said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
