Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson is set to be given 50 million pounds ($77.2 million) to
spend on transfers, with Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina among
his targets, the Mail on Sunday reported.  United is likely to offer 20 million pounds to its Premier
League soccer rival for the Spain goalkeeper, while the club is
also interested in Atletico Madrid’s David de Gea, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Ferguson is prepared to wait until the end of the season
for Reina as he searches for a replacement for 40-year-old Edwin
van der Sar, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
