Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. will
suspend sales of plug-in electric vehicles for as long as five
years because of a scarcity of charging facilities and the price
of lithium-ion batteries, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing
the company. Its plug-in Stella cars have been offered to
corporations and local governments. The automaker plans to re-
enter the market around 2016, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
