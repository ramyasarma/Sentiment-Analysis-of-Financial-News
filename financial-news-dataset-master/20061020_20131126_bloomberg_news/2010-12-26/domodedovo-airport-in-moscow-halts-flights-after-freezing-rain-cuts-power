Moscow’s Domodedovo airport halted
flights after the airport lost power, a spokeswoman said.  Freezing rain caused a failure in powerlines from two
stations that supply the airport and nearby towns, Elena
Galanova said by telephone from Moscow today.  Incoming flights are being diverted to Moscow’s
Sheremetyevo airport, state-run Vesti-24 television said.
Thousands of passengers have been stranded, the television said,
without citing anyone.  The power outage has left 200,000 people in the Moscow
region without electricity in near freezing temperatures, Vesti-
24 said.  OAO Mosenergo, the Moscow power utility, didn’t answer
calls on the progress of repairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
