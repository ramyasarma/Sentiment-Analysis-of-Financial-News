Researchers sequenced a genome of
cacao, which may help to breed stronger varieties of the crop
used to produce chocolate, according to a study in the journal
Nature Genetics.  About 30 percent of global cocoa production is lost to
disease and insects and the new information was sought to
“accelerate progress in cocoa breeding and the understanding of
its biochemistry,” Xavier Argout and colleagues reported in a
study published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
