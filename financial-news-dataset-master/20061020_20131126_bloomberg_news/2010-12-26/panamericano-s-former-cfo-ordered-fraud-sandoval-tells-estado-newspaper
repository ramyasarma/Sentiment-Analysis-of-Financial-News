Banco Panamericano SA ’s former
Chairman  Luiz Sebastiao Sandoval  said former Chief Financial
Officer  Wilson Roberto de Aro  and the bank’s former accountant,
Marco Pereira da Silva, were responsible for accounting
irregularities that led the bank to a 2.5 billion-real ($1.48
billion) bailout,  O Estado de Sao Paulo  newspaper reported.  Sandoval said Aro ordered Pereira da Silva to record as
assets loans the Sao Paulo-based bank had sold to other
institutions, according to Estado. Pereira da Silva said he
followed Aro’s order, during a meeting in mid-September,
according to Sandoval’s interview with Estado. Sandoval gave
testimony to the federal police on Dec. 23, the newspaper said.  Aro and Pereira da Silva said they started the accounting
changes during the 2008 financial crisis, Sandoval, the
executive who oversaw the Grupo  Silvio Santos  holdings for 40
years, told Estado. The board then found out the fraud started
in 2006, Sandoval said, according to Estado.  An official at Panamericano’s external press agency in Sao
Paulo said the bank wouldn’t comment on the interview and added
that he didn’t have a contact number to Pereira da Silva. Aro
won’t comment on the interview, according to Antonio Costa
Filho, a spokesman for the executive.  Aro’s spokesman also didn’t have a contact number for
Pereira da Silva. Attempts to locate Pereira da Silva’s phone
number through Internet and local directory services weren’t
successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
