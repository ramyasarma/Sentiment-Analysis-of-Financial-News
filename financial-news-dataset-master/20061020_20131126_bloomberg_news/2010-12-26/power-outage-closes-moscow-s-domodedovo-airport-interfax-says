Moscow’s Domodedovo airport halted
operations, neither receiving inbound flights nor allowing
takeoffs, after a power outage, Interfax said, citing an
unidentified airport official.  Freezing rain led to failures in the power lines connecting
local utilities to the airport, Interfax reported, without
saying when flights would resume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
