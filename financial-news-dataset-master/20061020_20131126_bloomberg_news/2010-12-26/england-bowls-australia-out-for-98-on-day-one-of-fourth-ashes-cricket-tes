England dominated the first day of
the fourth Ashes cricket Test in Melbourne by bowling out
Australia for a record-low 98 and reaching 157 without loss in
reply.  Alastair Cook  hit 80 and captain  Andrew Strauss  made 59 in
an unbeaten opening stand to back up the bowlers’ efforts in
dismissing Australia for its lowest first-innings total in elite
Tests at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  England, which would retain the Ashes by winning at the
MCG, leads by 59 runs with all 10 first-innings wickets in hand
after Strauss won the toss and chose to bowl first. The best-of-
five contest is tied at 1-1 following Australia’s 267-run win in
Perth seven days ago.  The tourists recovered from dropping two catches in the
opening three overs to remove the Australians in 42.5 overs.
 Chris Tremlett  claimed 4-26 and fellow fast bowler  James Anderson  took 4-44, while wicketkeeper  Matt Prior  took a career-
best six catches behind the stumps.  Michael Clarke  top scored for the home team with 20. It was
the second time this year Australia scored less than 100 in a
Test innings, following its 88 in July against Pakistan in
Leeds, England.  As Ashes holder, England would keep the trophy by tying the
series. The English last successfully retained the Ashes in
1986-87, when  Mike Gatting ’s team secured a 2-1 win in
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
