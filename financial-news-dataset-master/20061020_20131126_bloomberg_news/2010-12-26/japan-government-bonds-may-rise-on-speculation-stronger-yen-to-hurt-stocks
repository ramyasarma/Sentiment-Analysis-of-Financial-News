Japan’s 10-year  bond  yields were
near a four-week low before data tomorrow that may add to
evidence the nation is mired in deflation.  Ten-year bond futures rose after China increased interest
rates over the weekend to cool its economy, sparking concern
trade in the region will slow. Prime Minister Naoto Kan plans to
cap new bond sales at 44.3 trillion yen ($534 billion) in fiscal
2011 to finance a record budget for the year starting April 1,
according to a proposal approved by the Cabinet on Dec. 24.  “Money is prone to flow into the bond market as consumer
prices gradually erode,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in Tokyo
at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about $310
billion. “China’s monetary tightening may slow its economic
growth, reducing investor expectations for Japanese corporate
earnings.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond was unchanged at
1.15 percent at the 11:05 a.m. morning close in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The 1.2 percent security due December 2020 was 100.447 yen.  The yield fell to 1.125 percent on Dec. 22, the lowest
since Dec. 1. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery gained 0.16 to
139.89 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh food declined 0.6
percent in November from a year earlier, unchanged from the pace
in the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The government report is
due tomorrow.  Deflation, or a general drop in prices, enhances the value
of fixed payments from bonds.  Budget Poll  The People’s Bank of China increased key one-year lending
and deposit rates by 25 basis points on Christmas Day in its
second move since mid-October. The change took effect yesterday.  China was Japan’s biggest export market by the value of
products shipped during the six months to Sept. 30, according to
Japan’s Ministry of Finance.  Kyodo News said yesterday an opinion poll it carried out
showed Kan’s 2011 budget plan had a disapproval rating of 76
percent. The government expects new bond issuance to exceed tax
revenue for a second consecutive year.  “What’s most problematic is that there is almost no
visible clue to how Japan will consolidate its finances,” said
Sumitomo Trust’s Sera. “With Japan’s finances in this state,
10-year bond yields below 1 percent are not appealing even to
domestic investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
