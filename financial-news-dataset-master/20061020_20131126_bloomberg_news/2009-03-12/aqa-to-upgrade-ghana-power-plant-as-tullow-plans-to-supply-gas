             Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-controlled power and oil producer known as Taqa, plans to
upgrade a power plant in  Ghana  after  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  said it will
supply gas from the African nation’s offshore fields.  
 Taqa intends to increase capacity of its  Takoradi 2  power
plant, 220 kilometers (138 miles) west of the capital Accra, by
about 50 percent to 330 megawatts, Chief Executive Officer Peter Barker-Homek said in an interview today. The plant will also
switch to burning gas from diesel.  
 Tullow, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in  Africa ,
expects “over the next month or so” to agree with  Ghana
National Petroleum Corp.  on gas supplies from its Jubilee field
to the domestic market, Chief Operating Officer Paul McDade said
yesterday. Taqa plans to expand its projects in West Africa
beyond Ghana.  
 “Ghana is certainly interesting and we’re looking at the
 Ivory Coast ” and “I can see us expanding” in the region,
Barker-Homek said, commenting at the  Acquisition and Divestment
Summit  in  London . “Hopefully in the next 12 months we can
complete” the power plant upgrade, which can be supplied with
gas from Ghana and  Nigeria , he said.  
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and partners operate
the West African Gas pipeline, which is able to deliver 120
million cubic feet of gas a day to Ghana from Nigeria.
