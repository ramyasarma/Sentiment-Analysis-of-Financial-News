The extra yield Treasury investors
demand to hold 10-year notes over 2-year securities will keep
decreasing going into November’s Federal Reserve meeting,
according to CRT Capital Group, citing technical analysis.  “The unmistakable trend toward a flatter curve remains in
place,”  David Ader  and  Ian Lyngen , government bond strategists
at CRT Capital in Stamford, Connecticut, wrote in a note to
clients. “Momentum confirms the flattening trend.”  The difference between 2- and 10-year yields, the yield
curve, shrank 0.05 percentage point to 2.0489 percentage points
for the five days ended Oct. 8, its third straight weekly
decrease. It touched a record high of 2.94 percentage points on
Feb. 18. The U.S. Treasuries market was closed today for the
Columbus Day holiday.  The gap faces initial resistance at 2.09 percentage points,
followed by further resistance at 2.13 and 2.20 percentage
points, Ader and Lyngen wrote. Initial support is at 1.96
percentage points, they wrote. Resistance is a level on a chart
where sell orders may be clustered, and support is a level where
there may be buy orders.  Treasury notes posted a fourth straight weekly gain on Oct.
8 after data showing U.S. employers cut more jobs in September
than forecast increased speculation the central bank will start
a program of buying bonds to stimulate the economy. U.S.
payrolls shed 95,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department
said, compared with a decline of 5,000 forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. The Fed’s next policy meeting is Nov. 2-3.  The yield on the 10-year note dropped 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 2.39 percent last week, from 2.51
percent on Oct. 1. The 2-year yield fell 7 basis points to 0.34
percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
