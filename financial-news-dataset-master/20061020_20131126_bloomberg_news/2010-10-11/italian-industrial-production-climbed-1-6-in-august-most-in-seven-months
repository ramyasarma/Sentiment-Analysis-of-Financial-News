Italian industrial production rose
the most in seven months in August as gains in  exports  more than
offset weak  domestic demand .  Output  climbed 1.6 percent from July, when it increased a
revised 0.3 percent, Rome-based  statistics office Istat  said
today. Economists had forecast a 0.1 percent gain in August,
according to the median of 20 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .
Output jumped 9.5 percent from a year earlier.  Italy’s $2.3 trillion economy expanded 0.5 percent in the
three months through June as exports supported the recovery from
the worst recession in six decades.  Industrial orders  from
abroad rose in July while domestic orders fell. The Finance
Ministry  said  Sept. 29 that  gross domestic product  will expand
1.2 percent in 2010, up from 1 percent  predicted  on May 6.  The increase in Italian output was mirrored in Europe’s
largest economy. German  production  jumped 1.7 in August, the
country’s Economy Ministry said on Oct. 7. French output was
unchanged in August from July, when it rose 0.8 percent, Paris-
based statistics institute Insee said today.  Italian  business confidence  declined for the first time in
a year and a half last month amid concerns that the recovery may
lose momentum. With consumer spending weak, car registrations
fell 19 percent in September from a year earlier, as sales of
 Fiat SpA , Italy’s biggest manufacturer, dropped 26 percent from
the same month of last year.  Istat had initially reported a monthly increase in
industrial output of 0.1 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
