Gold fell in New York as the dollar
steadied, curbing demand for the precious metals as an
alternative investment. Silver gained for a second day.  The dollar was little changed against the euro, after
falling four consecutive weeks. Hedge funds and other large
speculators hold their most-bullish position in New York gold
futures in almost a year. Gold has climbed 23 percent this year
and silver is up 38 percent.  “The market has come a long way,” said  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London. “We have a bit of a
pause.”  Gold futures for December delivery declined $2.60, or 0.2
percent, to $1,342.70 an ounce at 8:49 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal dropped as much as 0.3 percent as the dollar
erased a decline against the euro. Silver for December delivery
was up 0.2 percent at $23.145 an ounce on the Comex, after
earlier rising to as high as $23.675, the most since September
1980.  Speculators were net-long, betting on higher New York gold
futures, by 259,620 contracts as of Oct. 5, the most since Nov.
24, according to a report by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission on Oct. 8.  Demand for gold as a haven from weakening currencies has
helped boost investment in exchange-traded products.  Global
holdings  gained about 1.1 metric tons to 2,084.76 tons on Oct.
8, according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers, after reaching
a record 2,097.01 tons on Sept. 30  Macquarie Bank Ltd. forecast that gold and silver will
trade 15 percent higher than previously expected next year.
Bullion will average $1,265 an ounce and silver $19.50 an ounce,
the bank said in a report e-mailed last week.  Platinum for January delivery fell $18.90, or 1.1 percent,
to $1,689.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange and
palladium for December delivery declined $1.05, or 0.2 percent,
to $586.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
