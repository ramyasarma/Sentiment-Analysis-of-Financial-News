GDF Suez SA , owner of Europe’s
biggest natural gas network, raised 2 billion euros ($2.8
billion) from its first sale of bonds in euros since January
2009.  The two-part issue includes 1 billion euros of seven-year
notes yielding 60 basis points more than the benchmark swap
rate, and 12-year bonds paying a spread of 80 basis points,
according to a banker involved in the transaction who declined
to be identified before a public statement. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  GDF’s yield premiums compare with 91 basis points on
average for European utility company debt due in five years,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The yield
gap has narrowed from this year’s peak of 101 basis points in
July, and 177 in January 2009 when GDF last sold euro-
denominated securities.  “GDF is taking the opportunity to extend the maturity of
its existing debt while lowering coupon payments, and still
offering investors some upside,” said  Anke Richter , a
strategist at London-based brokerage Conduit Capital Markets.
“As a cheaper means of financing, we’re likely to see a lot
more of these.”  GDF Suez is selling the debt as it seeks to buy back three
series of bonds, including its 4.375 percent bonds due in 2012,
its 4.75 percent securities maturing in 2013, and its 6.25
percent notes due in 2014, Bloomberg data show.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, BNP Paribas SA, Credit
Agricole CIB, Citigroup Inc., ING Groep NV, Natixis, Mitsubishi
UFJ and Societe Generale SA are managing GDF’s latest sale, said
the banker, who declined to be identified before terms are set.  Representatives for GDF weren’t immediately available to
comment.  Air Liquide SA , the world’s biggest producer of industrial
gases, raised 450 million euros from the sale of eight-year
bonds as part of a debt exchange and tender offer on Oct. 6. The
securities were priced to yield 55 basis points more than the
swap rate, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
