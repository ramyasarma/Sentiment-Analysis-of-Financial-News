Iberdrola SA , Spain’s largest
utility, said power production rose 2 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier as hydropower output increased while
generation at gas-fired plants declined.  Hydropower plants generated 64 percent more electricity in
the third quarter and output from coal-fired plants climbed 24
percent, the Bilbao, northern Spain-based company said today in
a regulatory filing. Output at gas-fired combined cycle plants
dropped 15 percent.  Iberdrola, the world’s largest owner of wind-energy parks,
generates more than half its power  outside Spain  after expanding
abroad to cut reliance on the Spanish market, where demand fell
last year. The company  bought  U.S. utility Energy East Corp. in
2008 and  Scottish Power Ltd.  in 2007.  The Spanish utility said Feb. 24 that gross investment from
2010 through 2012 may total 18 billion euros ($25 billion),
while asset sales may raise as much as 2.5 billion euros through
2012. Almost two-thirds of the planned gross investment was
earmarked for the U.S. and the U.K.  Iberdrola’s installed capacity totals 44,455 megawatts, of
which gas-fired plants account for 30 percent, renewable energy
27 percent, hydropower 22 percent, and nuclear plants 7.5
percent.  Iberdrola Renovables SA , the utility’s renewable-energy
unit, aims to increase its capacity to 12,500 megawatts by the
end of this year and to 16,000 megawatts by 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
