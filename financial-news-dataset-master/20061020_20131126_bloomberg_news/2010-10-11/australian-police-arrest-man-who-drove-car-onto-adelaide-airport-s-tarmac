A man scaled a fence at an airport
in the south Australian city of Adelaide then ran onto the
tarmac, a spokesman for the airport said.  “The man actually drove his vehicle into a glass partition
adjacent, but not part of, the main terminal,” Mark Williams, a
spokesman for Adelaide Airport Ltd., said by e-mail today. “He
then scaled a security fence and ran onto the tarmac.”  Sky News earlier reported that the man had driven his car
onto the airport tarmac and was now in the custody of the
Australian Federal Police. No explosives were found in his
vehicle, Sky reported.  Security  at Australia’s major airports is handled by the
federal police force as part of the nation’s counter-terrorism
measures. Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  was scheduled to be in
Brisbane in Queensland state at the time of the security breach
at Adelaide airport.  The government said in February it would boost spending by
A$200 million ($197 million) over four years to strengthen
Australian domestic and international aviation security.  The Australian Federal Police were not immediately
available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
