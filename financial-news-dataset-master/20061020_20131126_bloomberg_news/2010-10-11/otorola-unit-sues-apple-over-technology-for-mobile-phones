A  Motorola Inc.  unit sued computer
manufacturer  Apple Inc.  asking a court to rule it doesn’t
infringe 12 Apple patents for mobile telephone technology, and
that the patents aren’t valid.  Motorola Mobility Inc. contends in an Oct. 8 lawsuit that
Apple has “a history of asserting the patents-in-suit,” and
that it has “a reasonable apprehension” Apple will sue
Motorola over its phones with  Google Inc. ’s Android operating
system.  Motorola seeks a jury trial, non-infringement and patent-
invalidity rulings and an award of legal fees and costs from
Apple, according to papers filed in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  The patent action is the latest in a series of lawsuits
involving the two companies. The unit of Schaumburg, Illinois-
based Motorola Inc. filed three lawsuits and a trade complaint
against Cupertino, California-based Apple on Oct. 6 alleging
infringement of 18 patents.  Kristin Huguet , an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a voicemail message seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Motorola, with $22 billion in sales last year, rose 4 cents
to $8.34 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 2:27
p.m. Apple, with $42.9 billion in  fiscal 2009 sales , rose $2.58
to $296.65 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The new Delaware case is Motorola Mobility Inc. v. Apple
Inc., U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
