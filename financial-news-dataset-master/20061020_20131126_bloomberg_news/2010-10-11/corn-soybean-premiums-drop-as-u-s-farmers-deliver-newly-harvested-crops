Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month declined
relative to Chicago futures as warm dry weather accelerated
harvesting.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
October fell to 49 cents to 52 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 50 cents to 53 cents on Oct. 8, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. Soybean premiums fell to 51
cents to 60 cents above November futures from 54 cents to 64
cents.  “The cash market was again weaker today as buyers continue
to take large deliveries of newly harvested grain,” Kevin
Setzer, a commodity trading adviser and grain analyst at
MaxYield Cooperative in West Bend, Iowa, said in a report to
clients. “Demand remains strong for U.S. grain in the world
market.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 27.5 cents, or 5.2
percent, to close at $5.5575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Soybean futures for November delivery gained 17.5 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $11.525 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
