Fortescue Metals Group Ltd . is
considering borrowing as much as $6 billion to fund the
expansion of its Chichester and Solomon projects after securing
$2 billion in refinancing in recent days, the Australian
Financial Review said.  The figure, which Fitch Ratings says the company could
raise and maintain its BB+ corporate rating, is what Fortescue
would require if it decided to expand both projects
simultaneously, Chief Financial Officer  Stephen Pearce  told the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
