The dollar was near a 15-year low
against the yen on speculation the Federal Reserve will debase
the currency by signaling increased quantitative easing to
reduce unemployment.  The greenback rose against the euro before tomorrow’s
release of the Fed’s Sept. 21 policy meeting minutes as
technical indicators showed its drop last week to an eight-month
low may be hard to sustain. The pound fell to almost a five-
month low against the euro on speculation the Bank of England
will restart its debt-purchase program.  “The dollar is grossly oversold of late, and we are seeing
a bit of a relief rally on this quiet day,” said  Kathy Lien ,
director of currency research at the online currency trader GFT
Forex in New York. “The relief rally could turn into something
more substantial.”  The dollar was at 82.06 yen at 2:58 p.m. in New York,
compared with 81.93 yen on Oct. 8, after earlier today reaching
81.39 yen, the lowest level since April 1995. The U.S. currency
advanced 0.4 percent to $1.3890 per euro, from $1.3939, after
declining on Oct. 7 to $1.4029, the weakest level since Jan. 28.
The euro dropped 0.2 percent to 113.99 yen, from 114.19 yen.
Financial markets in Japan and bond markets in the U.S. were
closed for public holidays today.  The seven-day relative strength index of the euro versus
the dollar was at 72.218, remaining above 70 for a 16th
consecutive day in the longest stretch since March 2008.
Readings above that level indicate a currency may be poised for
a reversal of its gain.  IMF Meeting  Exchange rates dominated the International Monetary Fund’s
annual meeting as Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner ,
People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  and their
counterparts split over whose policies are the biggest threat to
the world economy on concern countries are relying on cheap
currencies to aid growth.  China was accused of undervaluing the yuan, while low U.S.
interest rates were blamed by emerging markets for flooding them
with capital. Brazil took aim at both the U.S. and China.  Finance ministers and central bankers pledged to improve
cooperation, yet did little to show how they would alter their
ways beyond agreeing to let the IMF study the matter. The focus
turns to Group of 20 talks in South Korea in coming weeks.  China’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest, may
have climbed in the third quarter by about $48 billion to a
record $2.5 trillion, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight economists. That would compare
with a $7 billion gain in the previous three months, the
smallest increase in 11 years. The central bank may release the
number this week.  Yen Versus Dollar  The yen remained stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged intervening in the
foreign-exchange market.  Japan’s Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said on Oct. 8 that
Group of Seven officials understood Japan’s position on the
yen’s gains and agreed that excessive foreign-exchange movements
are undesirable.  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
track the greenback against the currencies of six major trading
partners, gained 0.1 percent to 77.437 after dropping on Oct. 7
to 76.906, the lowest level since Jan. 15.  The gauge of the greenback has fallen 4 percent since Sept.
21, when the Fed said after its policy meeting that it’s willing
to ease monetary policy further to support the economy.  U.S. Job Market  U.S. employers cut payrolls by 95,000 workers in September
after a revised 57,000 decrease in August,  Labor Department 
figures in Washington showed Oct. 8. The median forecast of 87
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop.
The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Oct. 4 that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases aided
the economy and that further quantitative easing, or QE, is
likely to help more.  The Dollar Index’s 8.5 percent decrease in the third
quarter, its  biggest three-month drop  in eight years, may be
setting the stage for a rally.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show hedge funds
and other large speculators are more bearish on the dollar than
at any time in history, with bets on a  decline  exceeding those
on a rise by 341,683 contracts as of Oct. 5. The last two times
sentiment was close to this level, in early 2008 and late 2009,
the dollar rallied.  “Everybody sits in the same boat and is heavily negative
on the dollar,” said  Hans-Guenter Redeker , global head of
currency research in London at BNP Paribas. “When too many
people are sitting in a boat, it’s no longer safe.”  The pound declined 0.1 percent to 87.42 pence per euro
before a measure of U.K. inflation is released tomorrow.
Sterling touched 88.06 pence on Oct. 8, the weakest level since
May 7. The pounce dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5886.  To contact the reporters on this story:
