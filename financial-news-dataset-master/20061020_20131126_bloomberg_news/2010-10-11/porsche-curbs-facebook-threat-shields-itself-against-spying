Porsche AG  is blocking employees’
access to social-networking platforms such as Facebook Inc. and
 Xing  to shield the sports-car maker from industrial espionage.  Porsche, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is concerned that
foreign intelligence services may be spying on workers posting
“confidential” information on Facebook and other Web-based
services, exposing the carmaker to unwanted observation, Dirk
Erat, a Porsche spokesman, said today by phone.  “These services imply a certain threat potential,” Erat
said. Barring access at workstations to sites including  EBay
Inc.  reflects “principal company policy,” he said.  Facebook pledged in May to fine-tune privacy settings,
simplifying the way personal information is shared. The
company, which has more than 500 million members, had drawn
criticism from users and lawmakers, who complained that it
hadn’t gone far enough to keep private data under wraps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
