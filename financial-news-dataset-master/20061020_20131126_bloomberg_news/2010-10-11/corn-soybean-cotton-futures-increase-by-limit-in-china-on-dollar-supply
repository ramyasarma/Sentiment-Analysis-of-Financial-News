Corn, soybean and cotton futures in
China surged by exchange limits today, tracking gains in U.S.
markets, as a weaker dollar boosted their appeal as haven
assets and on concern that global demand will outstrip supply.  May-delivery corn on the Dalian Commodity Exchange gained
4 percent to 2,153 yuan ($323) a metric ton and closed at 2,149
yuan. Contracts in Chicago advanced to a two-year high after
the dollar fell toward an eight-month low against the euro on
speculation that Federal Reserve policy makers will signal this
week their willingness to buy more government debt to support
economic growth.  “Given the uncertain economic outlook in the U.S.,
there’s growing expectation that quantitative easing in the U.S.
is on the way, therefore worsening the outlook of the U.S.
dollar and boosting the appeal of commodities,” Yang Zhichang,
analyst at Yide Futures Co., said in a report today.  U.S. employers cut payrolls by 95,000 workers in September
after a revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department
figures in Washington showed on Oct. 8. The median forecast of
87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000
drop. The unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  Grains were also supported after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture on Oct. 8 cut its corn-crop estimate for the second
time in as many months, predicting a 3.4 percent decline from
last year after flooding in June and hot, dry weather in August
cut Midwest yields.  Corn gained as much as 8.5 percent to $5.7375 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade today, the highest level since
September 2008.  ‘Low Inventories’  Soybeans for May delivery surged by 4 percent to 4,276
yuan a ton and closed at 4,275 yuan. May-delivery rapeseed oil
and palm oil also jumped by the daily limit of 5 percent in
Dalian to 9,378 yuan a ton and 8,184 yuan, respectively.  “The latest U.S. Department of Agriculture report also
showed a surprisingly low soybean inventory estimate in the
U.S., leading to expectation that supply of the oilseed will
get tight,” Huatai Changcheng Futures Co. said in a report
today.  Gains in the agricultural commodities buoyed Chinese
equities. Seed makers  Gansu Dunhuang Seed Co.  jumped 10 percent,
the maximum allowed in one day, to 32.41 yuan a share in
Shanghai, and  Shandong Denghai Seeds Co . also advanced 10
percent to 76.89 yuan a share in Shenzhen.  Cotton Rally  Cotton for May delivery dvanced 9 percent to 25,390 yuan a
ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, the maximum allowed
today.  China, the world’s largest cotton buyer, had booked to buy
September booked to buy 595,000 tons of U.S. new-crop cotton,
by the end of September Wanda said. “The expectation is that
China will have to import a lot more” to bridge a domestic
supply shortfall, a factor that has supported cotton prices, it
added.  -- Feiwen Rong . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-Smith.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Feiwen Rong in
