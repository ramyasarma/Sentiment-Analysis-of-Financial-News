France may consider scrapping its
wealth tax together with a fiscal shield that limits the
proportion of a person’s income that can be paid in tax, La
Tribune reported, citing remarks by President  Nicolas Sarkozy .  Sarkozy said that differences in competiveness within the
European Union can be fixed through “convergence” and
“harmonization” of fiscal policy, the newspaper reported.  The repeal of both tax measures has been demanded by about
a hundred parliamentary members of the ruling UMP Party, La
Tribune said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
