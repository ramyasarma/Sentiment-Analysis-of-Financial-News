Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ’s U.K.
unit asked a London judge to determine the ownership of more
than $1 billion worth of securities left in the bank’s accounts
when it collapsed two years ago.  Lehman Brothers International Europe lawyer Iain Milligan
told Justice  Michael Briggs  that former Lehman units are
contesting the ownership of the securities that they had bought
and sold to each other in a series of internal transactions.  Lehman filed for the U.S.’s biggest bankruptcy in September
2008, disrupting financial markets and contributing to the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. The U.K. unit has
been involved in suits with the parent company in the U.S. and
affiliates throughout Europe over billions in accounts frozen
when the bank collapsed. Last week, it lost a German ruling over
$1.1 billion held by Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG.  “Ultimately you are being asked to make sense of what is
in some regards, a mess,” Milligan told the judge.  Milligan said that the case is complicated because the
bank’s internal transactions hadn’t been as well documented as
transactions with “the outside world.”  LBIE was buying and selling securities both on its own and
on behalf of other affiliates, Milligan said, leaving a
constantly changing balance in its accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
