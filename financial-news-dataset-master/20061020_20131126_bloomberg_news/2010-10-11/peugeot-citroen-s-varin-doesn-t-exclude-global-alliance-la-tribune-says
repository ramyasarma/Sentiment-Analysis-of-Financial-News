PSA Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive
Officer Philippe Varin is seeking to improve the company’s
financial ratios and increase its market value, and doesn’t
exclude the possibility of a global alliance once this has been
achieved, French daily La Tribune reported.  The newspaper didn’t directly cite Varin. The company
confirmed its target for full-year operating profit of 1.5
billion euros, La Tribune said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
