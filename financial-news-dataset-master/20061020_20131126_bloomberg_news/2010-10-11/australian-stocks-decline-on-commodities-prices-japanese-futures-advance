Australian  stocks  fell after
commodities prices declined, while Japanese stock futures rose
amid speculation the Federal Reserve will take measures to
stimulate the world’s largest economy.  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company,

depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker of
liquid-crystal displays, retreated 0.4 percent. Toyota Motor

Index  fell 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Strong U.S. earnings are expected because of the weak
dollar and that’s supporting stocks,” said  Kenichi Hirano ,
general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. “But
the trend of the currency remains unchanged, so that may drag
the Japanese stocks lower.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were unchanged.
