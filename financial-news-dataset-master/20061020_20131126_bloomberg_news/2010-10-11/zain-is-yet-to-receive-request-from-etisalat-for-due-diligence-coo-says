Mobile Telecommunications Co., the
Kuwaiti phone company known as Zain, hasn’t yet received any
request from Etisalat to carry out due diligence, Zain Chief
Operating Officer Barrak al-Sabeeh said today.  “We have not, as of 6.15 pm, received any single piece of
paper in that respect,” al-Sabeeh said during an Arab Media
Forum in Kuwait.  Etisalat, as Emirates Telecommunications Corp. is known,
offered 1.7 dinars a share for a 46 percent stake in Zain. The
sale is being led by the Kharafi Group, Zain’s second largest
shareholder.  The deal’s close date depends on receipt of a letter from
Etisalat, al-Sabeeh also said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
