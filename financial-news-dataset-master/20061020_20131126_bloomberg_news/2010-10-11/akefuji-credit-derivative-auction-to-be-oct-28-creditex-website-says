An auction to settle credit-default
swaps on  Takefuji Corp.  will be held Oct. 28 after the Japanese
consumer lender filed for bankruptcy, according to a  website  run
by bid administrators Markit Group Ltd. and Creditex Group Inc.  “It’s sooner than we initially thought,” said  Takayuki Atake , chief credit analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in
Tokyo. “We’ll need to do the auction with the recovery rate
estimate unclear because claims of overcharged interest from
customers are coming” and the company’s total liabilities are
uncertain until those claims are resolved, he said.  Takefuji, founded in 1966, became Japan’s biggest casualty
of a four-year crackdown on coercive lending to individuals when
it filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 28. It will follow  Aiful Corp. 
and Japan Airlines Corp. as the third company in Japan to have
credit-default swaps on its debt settled by auction.  Traders wrote a net $815.4 million of contracts in Takefuji
as of Oct. 1, according to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp.,
which runs a central repository for the credit-swaps market.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its debt obligations, less the value of the
defaulted bonds and loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
