ECM Real Estate Investments AG  fell
the most in a week on speculation the developer in central
Europe failed to reorganize its debt at a bondholder meeting
last week and may face bankruptcy.  ECM tumbled as much as 14 percent and traded down 5.9
percent at 127 koruna as of 11 a.m. in Prague, extending this
year’s loss to 59 percent. The trading volume was almost four
times the three-month average. ECM shares have slumped 17
percent so far this month.  The developer, whose bondholders were scheduled to meet on
Oct. 7 to vote on a proposed debt restructuring, has not issued
any statement on the outcome of the meeting. This indicates the
reorganization wasn’t approved and the company, which has total
debt of more than 7 billion koruna ($400 million), may face
bankruptcy, Lidove Noviny newspaper reported today.  “The risk of a debt-restructuring failure is increasing,”
 Radim Kramule , an analyst at the Prague-based unit of  Erste
Group Bank AG ,  Ceska Sporitelna AS , wrote in a report to clients
today. The Lidove Noviny report “is certainly not favorable.”  Milan Vodicka, an ECM spokesman, said he couldn’t comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News today. The company plans to
release an official statement, possibly after trading ends at 4
p.m. today in Prague, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
