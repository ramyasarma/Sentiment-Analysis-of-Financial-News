Quality HealthCare Asia Ltd. , which
agreed to sell its medical services unit to billionaire
Malvinder Singh’s Fortis Global Healthcare Holdings Pte., said
it can help the company start outpatient clinics in India.  “India at the moment is very hospital-centric, but it’s
just a question of time when patients and the community could
want community-outpatient services,” Lincoln Chee, Quality’s
chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview from Hong
Kong today. As the city’s largest operator of medical clinics,
there are “potentially a lot of areas” where Quality can share
its expertise, he said.  Quality shares headed for their highest closing level in
nine years after Fortis agreed to buy the division for HK$1.5
billion ($193 million). The purchase will give Fortis Global,
which controls  Fortis Healthcare Ltd. , India’s second-largest
hospital operator, a network of more than 60 medical centers, at
least 500 affiliated clinics and more than 40 dental and
physiotherapy centers.  Quality  jumped  13 percent to HK$5.75 as of the midday
trading break in Hong Kong, poised for its highest close since
July 4, 2001.  Fortis Healthcare  rose 1.3 percent to 173.5 rupees
as of 10:56 a.m. in Mumbai trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
