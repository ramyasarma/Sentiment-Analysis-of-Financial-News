Localiza Rent a Car SA , Latin
America’s biggest car-rental company, headed to a record close
in Sao Paulo trading after earnings beat forecasts.  Localiza gained 3.4 percent to 30.72 reais at 2:02 p.m. New
York time, the highest price on a closing basis since the
company’s May 2005 initial public offering.  The company said Oct. 8 after the market closed that it had
third-quarter net income of 74.9 million reais ($45 million),
higher than the median estimate of 62.1 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of three analysts.  “We are confident on the company’s growth prospects,”
 Renato Mimica  and  Sara Delfim , analysts at Bank of America
Corp., wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. Localiza
“should gain further momentum throughout the next two quarters,
delivering significant earnings expansion driven by higher
volumes, margin expansion and depressed depreciation expenses.”  Localiza is the second-best performer this year on the IBrX
index of Brazil’s 100 most-traded stocks. The company’s shares
have risen 59 percent this year as Latin America’s biggest
economy grows at the fastest pace in two decades, boosting
employment and consumer demand. The real is up 4.8 percent in
2010.  The “market might have partially priced the strong quarter
results,” the Bank of America analysts wrote. The stock, which
they rate “buy,” trades at 22.3 times next year’s estimated
earnings, compared to 10.4 times for the IBrX.  To contact the reporter on this story:
