Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
personally makes all major decisions about Russian economic
policy, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  The former president is “the most important factor in
the formation of the economic policy of our country,” Kudrin
said in an interview published in  Euromoney  magazine.  “He personally makes all key decisions, in line with his
understanding of economic policy,” Kudrin said. “Some
decisions are taken that I don’t agree with.” President  Dmitry Medvedev  also “plays an important role,” according to Kudrin.  Kudrin told reporters in Washington over the weekend that
he’ll wait until he writes his memoires to identify the Putin
policy decisions that he disagreed with.  To contact the reporter on this story:
