Mexico Tourism Minister  Gloria Guevara  said the country expects to have 22.6 million foreign
tourists this year, matching the industry’s 2008 numbers before
swine flu hurt activity last year.  The number of visitors grew 20 percent from January through
August from the same period a year earlier, the minister said
without specifying figures in an interview on Radio Formula.  From January to July, Mexico’s tourism industry received
$1.8 billion in investment, 28 percent more than in the same
period in 2009, Guevara said.  “This shows confidence in Mexico continues,” Guevara
said. “Investors are still betting on Mexico and betting on
tourism.”  Mexico’s travel industry has been hit by concerns about
violence associated with drug trafficking, an outbreak of H1N1
flu last year and the global economic slump. Tourism revenue
fell 15 percent to $11.3 billion in 2009 from $13.3 billion
2008, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
