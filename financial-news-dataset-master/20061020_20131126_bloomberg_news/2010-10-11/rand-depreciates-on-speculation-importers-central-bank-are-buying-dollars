South Africa’s rand weakened on
speculation importers and the central bank are boosting
purchases of dollars to take advantage of the currency’s rally
to an almost 33-month high.  The rand depreciated by as much as 0.8 percent to 6.8941
per dollar and traded at 6.8874 by 12:56 p.m. in Johannesburg,
from a previous close of 6.84. Earlier, the rand gained as much
as 0.2 percent to 6.8299, the strongest since January 2008.  The rand has rallied 37 percent versus the dollar since the
beginning of last year as interest rates near zero in developed
nations encourage investors to borrow cheaply there and invest
in markets offering higher returns. South Africa’s 6 percent
benchmark  interest rate  makes the rand a popular purchase in
this strategy, known by investors as the carry trade.  “We’re seeing constant importer buying of dollars --
importers would be stupid not to be buying with the rand at
these levels,” said  Ion de Vleeschauwer , chief dealer at
 Bidvest Bank  in Johannesburg, which runs South Africa’s largest
chain of moneychangers. “The central bank has also been
stepping up purchases. They don’t want to see the rand
strengthening forever.”  Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  warned last month
of a global “currency war” as developing nations grapple with
currency strength, which can curb exports as the global economic
recovery struggles to take hold. South African Finance Minister
 Pravin Gordhan  said the rand is “too strong” and that his
ministry is working with the central bank to curb currency
gains, Reuters reported last week.  Government bonds rose, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 adding 11 cents to 125.36 rand. The
yield on the bond decreased 3 basis points to 7.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
