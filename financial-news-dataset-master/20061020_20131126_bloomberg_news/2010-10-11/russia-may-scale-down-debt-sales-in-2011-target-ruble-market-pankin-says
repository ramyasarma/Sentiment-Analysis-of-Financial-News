Russia may scale down its plan for
record debt sales next year or choose to borrow more on the
domestic market, Deputy Finance Minister  Dmitry Pankin  said.  “It’s important for us to establish the maximum number and
then we can adjust it, reduce the amount or, say, borrow in
rubles instead of foreign currency,” Pankin told reporters
yesterday in Washington, where he took part in the International
Monetary Fund’s annual meeting.  The budget is expected to remain in deficit through 2014,
forcing the government to step up borrowing. The world’s biggest
energy supplier posted a deficit of 5.9 percent of gross
domestic product last year, its first since 1999, and estimates
this year’s gap will narrow to 5.3 percent.  The government in April sold its first foreign-currency
bond since defaulting on $40 billion of domestic debt in August
1998, with an offer of $5.5 billion of five-year and 10-year
dollar notes. Russia also plans its first overseas sale of ruble
debt this year and may sell as much as $3 billion of ruble bonds
with maturities of up to five years, Pankin said Sept. 8.  Russia originally planned to cover half of its borrowing
needs this year domestically and half abroad, before turning to
the local market for most of its financing needs.  Deficit  The Finance Ministry cut its planned domestic issuance this
year to 839 billion rubles ($28.1 billion) from 1.2 trillion
rubles. It plans to raise 1.3 trillion rubles next year, 1.5
trillion in 2012 and 1.49 trillion in 2013, according to a draft
2011-2013 budget published on the ministry’s  website . The
government may borrow as much as $7 billion annually in 2011 and
2012 on international markets.  “We make our forecast based on the budget deficit,”
Pankin said. “The main problem isn’t borrowing but capping
expenditures. We can’t always borrow to keep the budget in
balance.”  The government estimates the budget deficit at 3.6 percent
of GDP next year, 3.1 percent in 2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013.
Russia borrowed a record 293 billion rubles in the third quarter
and will seek to raise 300 billion rubles in the last three
months of this year.  Russia’s 2010 borrowing program was scaled down because the
government will guarantee less lending than anticipated, Pankin
said. “Borrowing needs will be slightly less because of that,
even with the same size of the budget deficit,” he said.
“That’s why the numbers were adjusted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
