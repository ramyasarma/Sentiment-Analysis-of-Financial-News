The cost of protecting bonds from
default fell in the Asia-Pacific region, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 3 basis points to 104 basis
points as of 8:33 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  The Markit iTraxx Australia fell 3 basis points to 106.5
basis points as of 8:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, Credit Agricole CIB
prices show. Japan is closed for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
