Deutsche Bank AG  sold $70 million of
one-year notes linked to Chinese government debt.  The notes pay a coupon of 125 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered  rate , or Libor, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities were issued at a
price of 100 percent of face value.  The securities reference China’s 2.48 percent yuan-
denominated bonds due October 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Investors face losing money on the securities if
China defaults.  Credit-linked notes are tied to the  creditworthiness  of a
country or company, paying interest based on the income from the
debt of the borrower they reference. They are usually sold to
investors who might have difficulty accessing the underlying
bonds for taxation or cost reasons.  China’s debt is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
fifth-highest investment grade, and an equivalent A+ by Standard
& Poor’s.  Three-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks
and used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.29 percent. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
