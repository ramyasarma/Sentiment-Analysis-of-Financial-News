Securities Group Co., a Kuwait-based
investment management firm, said it will not seek to block a bid
by Emirates Telecommunications Corp. to buy 46 percent of Mobile
Telecommunications Co., Chairman Ali al-Mousa said today to Al
Arabiya television.  Securities Group said investors holding 22 percent of
Mobile Telecommunications, known as Zain, were left out of the
planned deal.  Al-Mousa said Emirates Telecommunications, known as
Etisalat, should safeguard the interests of all Zain
shareholders, adding that Etisalat was not in talks with his
company. Al-Mousa said the offer by Etisalat is fair and
declined to identify the shareholders he represents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
