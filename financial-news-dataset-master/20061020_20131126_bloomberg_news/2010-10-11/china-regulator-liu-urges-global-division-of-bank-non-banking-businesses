China Banking Regulatory Commission
Chairman  Liu Mingkang  urged the use of firewalls to separate
banking and non-banking operations at global financial
institutions to avoid a systematic financial crisis.  Liu called for an international treaty to set up rules for
the bankruptcy of multinational financial institutions,
according to a  summary  of a speech posted to the regulator’s
website. He warned against a “significant” cross-border risk
in the global financial system.  Regulators should “grow teeth” and “refuse to easily
relax criteria” in implementing the new capital rules announced
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in September, Liu
said in the speech. China may require the nation’s biggest
lenders to boost their capital adequacy ratios to as high as 15
percent by the end of 2012, stricter than the international
standard, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.  Regulators’ interference with banks should be “timely, as
early as possible and frequent enough,” Liu said, according to
the summary citing his remarks during a meeting held on Sept. 22
and 23 in Singapore, which was posted to the website on Oct. 9.  The authorities should not allow the existence of banks
that are “too complicated to supervise,” and regulators need
to be able to interfere with lenders’ “highest decision-
making” process, Liu said, according to the statement.  -- Zhang Dingmin . Editors:  John Liu ,  Andreea Papuc   To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
