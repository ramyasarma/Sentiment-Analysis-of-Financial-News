Sesa Goa Ltd. , India’s largest iron
ore exporter, deferred its open offer for  Cairn India Ltd. 
shares that was due to start today, delaying parent Vedanta
Resources Plc’s plan to enter the oil exploration business.  The offer for a 20 percent stake in Cairn India is pending
the approval of the stock market regulator, Managing Director
 P.K. Mukherjee  said today by phone, without giving details. Sesa
Goa is making the open offer as part of Vedanta Resources’
acquisition of a portion of Cairn Energy Plc’s stake in its
Indian unit.  Vedanta Resources , the mining company controlled by
billionaire  Anil Agarwal , said on Aug. 16 it aims to buy as much
as 60 percent of Cairn India for $9.6 billion to gain access to
India’s biggest onshore oil field. Vedanta plans to raise as
much as $6.5 billion of bank debt for the acquisition.  Sesa Goa  rose as much as 3.3 percent to 361.60 rupees and
traded at 357.70 rupees as of 9:26 a.m. in Mumbai. The shares of
Cairn India rose as much as 5.7 percent to 355.90 rupees The
benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rose 0.6
percent.  While Vedanta Resources offered Cairn Energy 405 rupees a
share, including a non-compete fee of 50 rupees a share, Cairn
India’s minority shareholders are being offered a lower price.
 Sesa Goa  has offered 355 rupees a share, according to a
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Aug. 18.  Cairn Energy had a 62 percent stake in Cairn India, and
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s state oil company known as
Petronas, held 15 percent as of June 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sesa Goa plans to fund the purchase of Cairn India shares
with its own cash, Mukherjee said on Aug. 16. The company
estimates it will have a cash balance of 120 billion rupees
($2.7 billion) by the end of March next year that will help to
fund the purchase, he said. The company had cash surplus of
80.54 billion rupees as of June 30, according to its quarterly
results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
