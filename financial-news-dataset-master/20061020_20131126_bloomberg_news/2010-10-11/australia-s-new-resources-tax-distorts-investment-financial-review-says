Australian resource rent tax changes
made by Prime Minister Julia Gillard are too generous and will
distort investment in mining, the Australian Financial Review
said, citing an interview with Jack Minz, a Canadian oil an gas
company director. Minz, a member of the Canadian government’s
Economic Advisory Council and a tax specialist at the University
of Calgary, said the government’s system favors some types of
mining over others, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
