Turkish stocks rose to a record
high, the Turkish lira appreciated to its strongest in two years
and an index of bond yields headed for an all-time low after the
government said it will cut its deficit more than planned.  The main  ISE National 100  share index rallied 2.7 percent,
the biggest jump since Sept. 13, to close at 68,999.96 at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul, extending this year’s rally to 31 percent.
Yields on Turkey’s benchmark two-year bonds declined 12 basis
points to 7.72 percent, according to an ABN Amro Holding NV
 index , the lowest closing level since the index started in
October 2004. The lira advanced 0.3 percent to 1.4116 per
dollar.  The 2011-2013 economic program estimates a budget deficit in
2011 of 33.5 billion liras ($23.8 billion), or 2.8 percent of
economic output, according to details published yesterday in the
Official Gazette in Ankara. The version of the plan drawn up a
year earlier had predicted a gap of 45.1 billion liras in 2011,
or 4 percent of GDP.  “The economic program sounds pretty good and it’s
impacting markets,” said  Altug Dag , a trader at EFG Istanbul
Securities in Istanbul. “The markets would like to see how much
of the program will be implemented.”  The  economy  may expand 6.8 percent this year, almost double
the estimate of 3.5 percent set in 2009’s three-year plan, the
government said. Healthy household and bank balance sheets may
help the economy grow 7.8 percent this year, the International
Monetary Fund said on Oct. 6. The government’s growth forecast
for 2011 is 4.5 percent.  The deficit announcement is more “good news for Turkish
assets and will extend the period of the lira’s strength,”
strategists including  Elisabeth Gruie  at BNP Paribas SA in
London wrote in a research note today.  More Restrictive  The government has delayed introducing a “fiscal rule,”
which would require deficits to be limited to 1 percent of
economic output, until after a general election next year.  “This is actually more restrictive than the fiscal rule
would have determined, but it also assumes that the government
remains in power to push it through,”  Simon Quijano-Evans , head
of emerging-market strategy at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux in
Vienna, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Turkey’s debt stock as a proportion of output will also
fall faster, the new plan shows. Debt will decline to 42.3
percent of gross domestic product this year. The old plan saw
debt at 49 percent at the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
