Malaysia’s inflation is currently
not a risk, providing the central bank with “flexibility”
before deciding on further interest-rate moves, Governor  Zeti Akhtar Aziz  said.  The current level of borrowing costs is “the appropriate
rate” that’s “very supportive” of economic activity, Zeti, 63,
said in an interview in Washington yesterday. That’s in line
with the central bank’s view that it “needs to remain
accommodative” in its monetary policy stance, she said.  Malaysia started raising rates before any other Asian
central bank this year to reduce what officials say is a risk of
financial imbalances caused by keeping borrowing costs too low
for too long. Zeti and her fellow policy makers left its
 benchmark overnight policy rate  unchanged at 2.75 percent at
their September meeting after three consecutive increases,
choosing to support growth as the global recovery slows.  “We’re not going to run the economy into the ground just
to achieve price stability,” Zeti said. “Growth considerations
are also important. There’s going to be moderation in global
growth. We are not immune,” said the governor, in Washington
for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank’s annual
meetings.  Malaysia’s economy, the largest in Southeast Asia after
Indonesia and Thailand, grew near its fastest pace in a decade
in the second quarter, with  gross domestic product  climbing 8.9
percent from a year earlier. The nation may achieve growth of at
least 6 percent for this year even though there may be some
deceleration in the fourth quarter, International Trade &
Industry Minister  Mustapa Mohamed  said Oct. 7.  Subsidies Cut   Inflation climbed in August to the highest level in 15
months after the government cut state subsidies on sugar and
fuel. Exports rose at their slowest pace in nine months that
month.  “Right now, we don’t see a risk of inflation,” Zeti said.
As the central bank doesn’t adopt the approach of inflation-
targeting, “we have flexibility with our policy on this
count.”  Inflation  now is “slightly lower” than originally
projected, Zeti said, adding that interest rates are not the
only instrument available for central bankers to deal with price
pressures.  “We look at a more diversified tool kit to deal with these
problems should they arise,” she said. For example, the threat
of rising food prices “is not solved by interest rates,” said
Zeti. “It has to be other policies.”  Currency Gains  The ringgit is this year’s second-best performing currency
in Asia excluding Japan, gaining 10.5 percent this year on
improved capital inflows. It traded at 3.1030 per dollar as of
12:47 p.m. local time.  “We’ve been able to absorb” the gains in the currency
because of the economy’s flexibility, Zeti said. The bigger
concern is that “any adjustment remains orderly” and
“gradual,” she said.  Countries from Brazil to South Korea have taken steps to
cool currency appreciation amid rising capital inflows into
emerging and Asian economies. The recent moves to stem the gains
triggered concern among officials attending the IMF meetings
that protectionist retaliation would impede global growth.  Malaysian  exporters  are coping with the ringgit’s
appreciation, having seen it reach this level in the past, Zeti
said. Central bankers haven’t met with exporters recently about
the need for support measures to shield them from the rising
currency because “it is not an issue of concern” at this time,
she said.  The country is enjoying “strong” expansion and domestic
demand is “very sustainable”, Zeti said. External demand is
“less predictable” and growth may be slower next year.  Zeti’s comments on inflation and flexibility on rates
“confirms our view of no rate move this year,” said Dariusz
