Janet Yellen , in her first public
remarks as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman, said low
interest rates may give firms the incentive to engage in
excessive risk-taking.  “It is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy
could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive
risk-taking in the financial system,” the 64-year-old central
banker said in a speech today in Denver.  Yellen warned that Fed policies may in some cases be
encouraging firms to “reach for yield” and could present
officials “with difficult tradeoffs” if “emerging threats to
financial stability become evident.”  The Fed vice chairman spoke while central bank officials
debate whether to take further action to stimulate the economy,
and as the Fed board in Washington gears up to implement
directives under the Dodd-Frank law that overhauls U.S.
financial regulation. Her comments weren’t specifically focused
on the Fed’s current monetary policy.  “Our goal should be to deploy an enhanced arsenal of
regulatory tools to address systemic risk,” Yellen, the former
president of the San Francisco Fed, said in a luncheon address
to the National Association for Business Economics. “We need
macroprudential policy makers ready to take away the punch bowl
when the party is getting out of hand.”  ‘Risk-Taking Behavior’  “Monetary policy cannot be a primary instrument for
systemic risk management,” Yellen said in the text of her
speech. Still, “I cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility
that situations could emerge in which monetary policy should
play some role in reining in risk-taking behavior,” she said.  The Dodd-Frank legislation was enacted in July after a
bubble in U.S. housing prices burst, resulting in more than $1.8
trillion of global losses and writedowns and spurring Fed-backed
rescues of Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group
Inc.  Under the new law, the Fed will supervise all large,
systemically important financial institutions and work with
other regulators on a Financial Stability Oversight Council to
identify emerging risks.  Referring to the power of regulators to wind down failing
institutions, she said in response to an audience question, “it
will be complex to design a resolution regime, especially for
the largest and globally most complex institutions.”  “I’m very hopeful that a resolution regime is workable,”
she said.  Stocks erased earlier gains, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index declining less than 0.1 percent to 1,165.05 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York.  ‘Top Priority’  Yellen said “a top priority” of regulators assigned to
monitor systemic risks should be determining whether asset
prices are signaling the emergence of a bubble. She added that
surveillance of emerging risks is likely to focus in part on the
accumulation of credit and funding risk inside systemically
important firms, and counterparty risks.  “A first-order priority must be to engineer a stronger,
more robust system of financial regulation and supervision, one
capable of identifying and managing excesses before they lead to
crises,” Yellen said.  “We know that market participants won’t take kindly when
limits are set precisely in those markets that are most
exuberant, the ones in which they are making big money,” she
said. Even so, “discretionary interventions will inevitably
play a part in macropruential supervision.”  “We must find the right balance between overly strict
supervision and laissez faire,” she said.  Yellen won the support of the  U.S. Senate Banking Committee 
in July to become the Fed’s vice chairman. She was confirmed by
the Senate in September and sworn in on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
