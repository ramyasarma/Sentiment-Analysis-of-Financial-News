Grupo Televisa SA , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, sold 10 billion pesos
($805 million) today of fixed-rate bonds due in 2020 to fund
acquisitions.  The bonds’ yield is 7.38 percent, Televisa said in a
statement today to Mexico’s stock exchange. Banco Santander SA
and HSBC Holdings Plc managed the sale, Mexico City-based
Televisa said.  The sale is Televisa’s first of new long-term debt since a
$600 million issue of 30-year bonds almost a year ago, according
to Bloomberg  data .  The debt would help fund the company’s agreement this month
to spend $1.2 billion for a stake of as much as 35 percent in
U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc.
Televisa is also in talks with NII Holdings Inc. on the closing
conditions for a $1.44 billion investment in the mobile-phone
company’s Mexican unit.  Televisa rose 34 centavos, or 0.6 percent, to 53.95 pesos
in Mexico City  trading . The shares have dropped less than 1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
