Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
asked a London judge to reverse changes to Liverpool’s board
that could block the soccer club’s planned sale to New England
Sports Ventures LLC for 300 million pounds ($474 million).  Owners  Tom Hicks  and  George Gillett  have sought to halt the
sale of Britain’s most successful team, saying the price is too
low. Fans have protested their ownership and RBS says the
Americans breached their contract when they tried to replace
Chairman  Martin Broughton  and other independent board members
who approved the sale.  The case “concerns what is an admitted breach of contract
by Mr. Hicks and Mr. Gillett” done to “frustrate the sale
process,” RBS lawyer  Richard Snowden  said at the High Court in
London today.  The move showed “breathtaking arrogance,” he said.  RBS, which required Hicks and Gillett to add independent
board members when they last refinanced debt, is the applicant
in the suit. The men may lose about 140 million pounds if the
deal goes through, Broughton has said.  RBS, based in Edinburgh, wants the court to issue an
injunction forcing Hicks and Gillett to abide by the contract
and restore a “clearly functioning” board that can act in the
best interest of creditors, Snowden said.  NESV is controlled by Boston Red Sox owners  John W. Henry 
and  Tom Werner . Liverpool’s board, which has approved the sale,
is seeking court confirmation of the deal’s validity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
