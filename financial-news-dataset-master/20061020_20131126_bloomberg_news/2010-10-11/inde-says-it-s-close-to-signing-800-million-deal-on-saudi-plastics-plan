Linde AG , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, is close to securing an $800-million
contract to help build a plastics plant in Saudi Arabia, a
company executive said.  The company is within “a few weeks” of signing the deal
to help build the acrylic-acid project in Jubail, Matthias
Stein, the Munich-based company’s Middle East general manager
said yesterday in an interview during an oil and gas exhibition
in Khobar in the country’s east.  The plant is a $1.7-billion joint venture between National
Industrialization Co., the Saudi Arabian petrochemical maker
known as Tasnee, Sahara Petrochemical Co. and  Dow Chemical Co. 
The project is due to start full production in 2013 and some
sections will be running next year, Tasnee’s Chairman  Mubarak al-Khafrah  told Bloomberg in May.  The company and its advisers were “studying different
alternatives” to finance the venture, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
