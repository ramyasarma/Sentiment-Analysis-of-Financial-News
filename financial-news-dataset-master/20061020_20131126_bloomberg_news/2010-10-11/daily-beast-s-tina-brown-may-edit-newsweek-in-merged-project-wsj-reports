Newsweek may be edited by Daily
Beast news website co-founder Tina Brown if the two media 
entities merge operations, the Wall Street Journal reported, 
citing people familiar with the matter.  Newsweek was acquired from the Washington Post Co. by
entrepreneur Sydney Harman earlier this year, and the Daily
Beast is co-owned by Brown and IAC/InterActive Corp., which has
Barry Diller as chairman and chief executive officer.  Under a deal being discussed between the two sides, Brown
would assume the editorship of Newsweek and continue her role at
the Daily Beast; although hurdles remain, the chances of a deal
are getting stronger, the newspaper reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
