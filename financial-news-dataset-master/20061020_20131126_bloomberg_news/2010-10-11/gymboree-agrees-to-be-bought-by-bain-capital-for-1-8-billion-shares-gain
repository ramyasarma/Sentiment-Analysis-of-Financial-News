Gymboree Corp., the children’s
apparel retailer, has agreed to be acquired by Bain Capital
Partners LLC for $65.40 per share in cash, or $1.8 billion. The
shares rose to $69.18 after closing at $52.95 on Oct. 8.  The $65.40 offer is a 57.4 percent premium to the company’s
unaffected share price on Sept. 30, before recent market rumors
of a transaction, and a 23.5 percent premium to Gymboree’s
closing stock price on Oct. 8, the last full trading day before
today’s announcement, the company said in a statement.  Under the terms of the agreement, it is anticipated that
affiliates of Bain Capital will commence a tender offer for all
of the outstanding shares of Gymboree shortly following the
execution of the agreement. If the tender offer is successfully
completed, Gymboree expects the transaction to close by year
end.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
