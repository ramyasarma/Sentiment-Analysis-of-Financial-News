Copper in London and New York
climbed to 27-month highs on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will increase measures to stimulate the U.S. economy,
weakening the dollar and boosting demand for commodities as
alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to $8,350.50 a metric ton,
the highest level since July 2008, and traded at  $8,350 a ton
by 11:03 a.m. in Singapore.  Futures for December-delivery on the Comex in New York
gained as much as 0.9 percent to $3.8065 a pound, also the
highest since July 2008, before trading at $3.8040 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
