Electrolux AB, Europe’s largest
appliance maker, agreed to buy a 52 percent stake in Egyptian
wash-machine manufacturer Olympic Group Financial Investments in
a transaction valued at about $246 million.  The owner of the Frigidaire brand will pay Paradise Capital
45.3 Egyptian pounds a share for its controlling interest in
Olympic Group, the Swedish company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The Egyptian company last traded at 30.06 pounds.  With the transaction, Electrolux is cementing a 30-year
commercial partnership with the Egyptian manufacturer, tapping
demand in the fast-growing appliance markets of the Middle East
and North Africa. Olympic Group, which has a 30 percent share of
the Egyptian market, had sales of 2.1 billion pounds ($368
million) in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
