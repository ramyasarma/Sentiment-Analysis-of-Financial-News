Toshiba Corp.’s Westinghouse
Electric Co. said it’s “fully” interested in South Africa’s
plans to build six nuclear power plants by 2023 as the country
seeks to tackle an energy shortage.  Westinghouse would participate in a tender to supply atomic
plants to Africa’s biggest economy, Bultie Nel, managing
director of the company’s local unit, said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. Westinghouse “is constantly working on
how to provide this high-safety technology at a still better
competitive price,” Nel said.  South Africa is battling an electricity shortage after the
government suspended the expansion plans of state-owned utility
Eskom Holdings Ltd. while it tried and failed to convince
private companies to build power plants. That resulted in a
five-day shutdown of most mines in the country in early 2008.  In December of that year, South Africa halted plans to
build a second, 120 billion-rand ($17.5 billion) nuclear plant
as the global financial crisis tightened credit markets.
Westinghouse and  Areva SA , the world’s largest supplier of
reactors, had vied for the canceled order.  Eskom subsequently cut a five-year, 460 billion-rand
expansion program because of a lack of funding.  South Africa is the world’s biggest platinum producer and
third-largest miner of gold. Koeberg, the country’s only nuclear
plant, started operations in 1984 and is located about 30
kilometers (19 miles) north of Cape Town in Western Cape
province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
