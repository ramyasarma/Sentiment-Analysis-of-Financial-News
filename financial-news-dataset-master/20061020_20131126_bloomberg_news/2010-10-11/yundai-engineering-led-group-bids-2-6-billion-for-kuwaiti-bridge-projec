A group led by  Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co.  made the lowest bid to design, build, operate
and maintain a bridge in Kuwait, one of the country’s biggest
infrastructure projects, the Central Tenders Committee said.  The group offered to carry out the project to build the
Jaber Al-Ahmad bridge for 738.8 million dinars ($2.6 billion),
the committee announced on its  website  today.  Competing bidders for the project included Saudi Binladin
Group with 805 million dinars, and Australia’s Leighton Holdings
Ltd. with 807.3 million dinars, the state news agency  KUNA 
reported today. The government will study the offers and make
recommendations, according to KUNA.  The bridge will span 37 kilometers (23 miles), mostly
across water, and take five years to build, Hussein Mansour,
assistant undersecretary for road affairs at the Public Works
Ministry, told a conference today in Kuwait. The causeway will
link the mainland to Subbiya in the north, where a Silk City is
planned as part of a 30.8 billion-dinar development project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
