Iran said it arrested two foreign
nationals who entered the Persian Gulf country as tourists and
interviewed the son of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, an Iranian
woman sentenced to death by stoning.  The two German citizens are journalists and were arrested
in the northwestern city of Tabriz yesterday along with the son,
Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, and a lawyer, Houtan Kian, according to a
 statement  issued today by the International Committee Against
Stoning, a campaigning group.  “After investigation it was made clear that these two
individuals were not journalists and even if they were, they did
not have the relevant documents,” Prosecutor General  Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei  was quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.  Mohammadi-Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006. Her
death sentence has drawn international outrage. Iran has
condemned the media attention, saying the woman is also guilty
of taking part in the murder of her husband.  Iranian security forces entered Kian’s office while an
interview was taking place, according to ICAS. One of the
journalists was on the phone speaking with Mina Ahadi, the
group’s spokeswoman, and “had to abruptly end the call when the
security forces brutally pushed their way in,” ICAS said.  The location of the four is unknown and no information has
been received about them, the group said.  -- Editors:  Digby Lidstone , Eddie Buckle.   To contact the reporter on this story:
