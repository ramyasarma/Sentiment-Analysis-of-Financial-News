Brazil’s  consumer prices  will rise
this year and next more than analysts previously expected,
according to a central bank survey, adding to pressure for
policy makers to resume interest rate increases early next year.  Inflation will quicken to 4.98 percent in 2011, up from a
week-earlier forecast of 4.92 percent, according to the median
forecast in an Oct. 8 central bank  survey  of about 100
economists published today. For 2010, prices will rise 5.15
percent by year-end, compared with a week earlier forecast of
5.07 percent, the survey shows.  Analysts expect the central bank to resume  interest rate 
increases in April as domestic demand stokes inflation. Policy
makers held the benchmark rate unchanged at 10.75 percent at
their Aug. 31-Sept. 1 meeting, after raising it 200 basis points
this year from a record low 8.75 percent.  “The probability of rate increases next year is higher,”
 Zeina Latif , a senior economist for Latin America at RBS
Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo, said. “There is no outlook for
commodity prices to ease, and we are going through a complicated
seasonal period where domestic inflation quickens, especially
because of higher food prices.”  Yields on interest rate futures contracts maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage points, to 11.42 percent at 9:12 a.m.
New York time. The real gained 0.1 percent to 1.6644 per dollar
from 1.6661 on Oct. 8.  Fastest Pace  Inflation quickened to the fastest pace in five months in
September as food  prices  pushed the annual rate above the
government’s target.  Consumer prices  as measured by the benchmark IPCA index
rose 0.45 percent in September from August, the government’s
statistics agency said.  Prices  rose 4.70 percent from a year
earlier. The readings were in line with the median estimates of
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Policy makers forecast inflation will slow to 4.6 percent
next year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 10.75
percent, according to a Sept 30 report. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent.  “The Monetary Policy Committee believes that a convergence
of inflation toward the target’s mid-point is tending to
materialize,” the central bank said in their Sept. 30 inflation
report. Economic activity is expanding at a pace more
“consistent with long-term equilibrium.”  Latif expects policy makers to keep interest rates
unchanged next year and said a short-term spike in consumer
prices has been accounted for in the central bank’s forecast.  “Faster inflation can be transitional,” Latif said.  Economists kept their 12-month inflation forecast unchanged
at 5.16 percent, the central bank survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
