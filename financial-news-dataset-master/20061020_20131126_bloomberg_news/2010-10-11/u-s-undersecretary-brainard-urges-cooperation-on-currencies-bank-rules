Countries around the world need to
work more closely together on foreign exchange policies and
financial supervision, said  Lael Brainard , the U.S. Treasury’s
undersecretary for international affairs, speaking in Washington
today.  “When some countries engage in policies of competitive
non-appreciation that impede global adjustment, it exacerbates
adjustment challenges for other countries -- whether through
intensified capital inflows or diminished trade opportunities --
and lowers growth overall,” Brainard said in prepared remarks
for a speech to the Institute of International Bankers.  Brainard also reiterated the U.S. view that promoting
global growth should be the overarching goal for international
leaders, and she called for tougher and more coordinated
oversight of hedge funds and derivatives.  Her remarks come after a weekend of talks in Washington
that failed to resolve currency tensions. At meetings of the
Group of Seven nations and the International Monetary Fund, the
U.S. continued to press for China to let its currency rise,
while economic leaders agreed on little other than the need for
further IMF studies.  Brainard said officials at the meetings “emphasized the
critical responsibility of each major economy to support the
global adjustment process.” She also said the world needs to
come together to force banks to hold more capital, and she said
the U.S. is committed to implementing new rules from the Basel
Committee on Bank Supervision, also known as Basel III.  To contact the reporter on this story:
