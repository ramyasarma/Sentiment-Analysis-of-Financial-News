The Bank of Japan may report
downward revisions when it releases its outlook on the nation’s
economy and consumer prices on Oct. 28, Kyodo News reported
yesterday, citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t
identify.  The consumer price index excluding fresh food may fall or
stay unchanged in fiscal 2011 from a year earlier, compared with
a July estimate of an increase of 0.1 percent, Kyodo reported.  The outlook for gross domestic product for this fiscal year
may be cut to less than 2.5 percent from the earlier forecast of
2.6 percent, while the outlook for fiscal 2011 may be cut to a
range of about 1 percent to 1.5 percent, from 1.9 percent, Kyodo
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
