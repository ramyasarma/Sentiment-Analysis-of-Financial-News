Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. estimates
a pre-tax profit impact of A$15 million to A$20 million from an
initial assessment of the reservations and check-in system
outage. Virgin Blue said it will actively pursue all avenues to
recover this cost.  “Prior to the outage, the group had seen an improvement in
general trading conditions when compared to the corresponding
period last year,” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
