Stockland is in talks to sell its
half share in the A$450 million Waterfront Place tower in
Brisbane, adding it to the 50 percent stake already on offer
from its Direct Office Trust No. 1, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information.  The tower would need an overhaul that could cost as much as
A$70 million, the newspaper said. Jones Lang LaSalle, which was
marketing the Trust’s stake, is believed to be handling the sale
of the entire complex, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
