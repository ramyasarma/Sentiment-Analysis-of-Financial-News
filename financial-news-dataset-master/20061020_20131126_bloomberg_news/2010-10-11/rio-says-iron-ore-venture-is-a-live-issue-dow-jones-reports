Rio Tinto Group’s planned iron ore
joint venture with BHP Billiton Ltd., which is under scrutiny by
regulators, remains a “live issue,” Dow Jones Newswires
reported today, citing Rio’s Iron Ore Chief Executive  Sam Walsh .  The prospect of regulatory amendments didn’t mean the
venture was “impossible” and the value of the deal needed to
be studied against dislocation from any potential comments from
regulators, Dow Jones said, citing Walsh in an interview in
Brisbane. Rio said Oct. 6 that regulators had signaled they may
object to the venture, which aims to save the companies $10
billion in costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
