Paolo Monferino , chief executive
officer of  Fiat SpA ’s Iveco truck division, will leave the
carmaker to take a post with the regional government in
Piedmont, a regional official said by phone today.  Monferino has been appointed head of health services for
Piedmont, the region in which Turin-based Fiat is located, the
region said on its website today. Monferino will sign his new
contract on Oct. 18, said the official, who declined to be named
citing agency policy.  Monferino, who began his career with Fiat in 1973 as a
design engineer, became head of Iveco in February 2005. He had
previously served for five years as chief executive of Fiat’s
CNH Global NV tractor-making unit.  Fiat is spinning off industrial operations including Iveco
and CNH Global to focus on cars. The company plans to list Fiat
Industrial SpA shares on the Milan exchange on Jan. 3.  The news is “unlikely to be helpful just months away from
the spin-off of Fiat industrial,” Credit Suisse analyst David
Arnold wrote in a note to clients today.  Fiat CEO  Sergio Marchionne  said Sept. 16 that the Iveco and
CNH chiefs would jointly run Fiat Industrial.  Alfredo Altavilla  may be named CEO of Iveco, daily  La
Repubblica  reported Sep. 22. A Fiat spokesman declined to
comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
