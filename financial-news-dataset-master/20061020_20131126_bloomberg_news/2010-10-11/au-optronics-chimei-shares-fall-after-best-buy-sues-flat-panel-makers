AU Optronics Corp.  and  Chimei
Innolux Corp.  tumbled in Taipei trading after  Best Buy Co.  sued
flat-panel makers over antitrust claims.  AU Optronics , Taiwan’s second-largest flat-panel maker,
fell 1.3 percent to NT$30.30 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei,
the lowest since Sept. 9. Chimei Innolux, the island’s biggest,
dropped 2.4 percent to NT$40.05, the lowest since Sept. 24.  From 1996 to 2006, the makers of displays used in
computers, televisions and mobile phones agreed on prices and
production volumes, according to the complaint filed Oct. 8 in
federal court in San Francisco. Yawen Hsiao, a spokeswoman at
Hsinchu-based AU Optronics, and Eddie Chen, a spokesman for
Miaoli-based Chimei Innolux, declined today to comment.  Other manufacturers named in the suit include Nagano,
Japan-based Seiko Epson Corp., Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd., Seoul-
based LG Display Co. and Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp.  Chimei Innolux was formed when Chi Mei Optoelectronics,
Innolux Display Co. and TPO Displays Corp. combined in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
