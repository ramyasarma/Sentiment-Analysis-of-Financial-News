Czech central bank Governor  Miroslav Singer  said the koruna is now returning to a “long-term”
strengthening trend and there is no need to act against the
currency’s movements.  The koruna has gained 4.9 percent against the euro since
the end of June, making it the world’s best performing currency,
according to Bloomberg data. It was unchanged today at 24.488 to
the euro as of 10:05 a.m. in Prague.  “After fluctuations over the last two years, the exchange
rate is returning to its long-term nominal appreciation path,”
Singer said in a presentation posted on the central bank’s
website. “It represents no significant risk.”  The  Czech Republic , which doesn’t have a target date for
joining the euro area, is recovering from the worst recession
since the end of communism two decades ago caused by the drop in
demand for its exports, such as Skoda Auto AS cars.  Gross
domestic product  rose an annual 2.4 percent in the April-June
period, the fastest growth in two years.  The Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka, which targets
inflation as its policy goal, has “only occasionally” tried to
influence the koruna’s movements to reduce its volatility on the
foreign-exchange market and “has never tried to achieve” a
specific exchange-rate level, Singer said. “There is no reason
to intervene nowadays.”  The economy, in which exports account for about 70 percent
of GDP, benefitted from having its own currency during the
global economic crisis as it served as a buffer against shocks,
Singer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
