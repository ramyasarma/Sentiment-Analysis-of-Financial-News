The Federal Reserve will increase
its Treasury purchases at a policy meeting next month, helping
the U.S. avoid the “very bad” economic outcome of a renewed
recession, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  A loss of 95,000 jobs in September reported by the Labor
Department Oct. 8 will lead the Fed to act, New York-based  Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said in an e-
mailed note. Policy makers will announce roughly $500 billion of
Treasury purchases through about the middle of 2011 and indicate
they are ready to buy more, according to Goldman, one of the 18
primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed.  U.S. two-year yields extended declines to record lows today
as traders bet the Fed will buy more Treasuries as it tries to
keep borrowing costs down. The economy will expand less than
previously estimated, a survey showed, underscoring the need for
Fed action. It purchased $300 billion of Treasuries in 2009
under a policy known as quantitative easing, or QE. Traders
preparing for another round of buying have dubbed it QE2.  “QE2 and its impact on financial conditions is one key
reason why we expect the economy over the next six-nine months
to be only ‘fairly bad’ rather than ‘very bad,’” Hatzius wrote
in his note. “Friday’s jobs numbers put the seal on a
quantitative easing announcement at the Nov. 2-3 FOMC meeting.”  The Fed may need to hold interest  rates  at current levels
until 2015 or later, he wrote. Policy makers cut the target for
overnight lending between banks to a range of zero to 0.25
percent in December 2008.  ‘Bad’ Scenarios  A “fairly bad” economy will be defined by gross domestic
product growth of 1 percent to 2 percent, a gradual increase in
unemployment and disinflation, according to Hatzius. A “very
bad” outcome will be a renewed recession, he wrote.  The two-year note  yielded  0.34 percent as of 10:20 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The rate dropped to a
record low of 0.335 percent earlier today. The 0.375 percent
security due in September 2012 traded at a price of 100 2/32.  The central bank is scheduled today to release minutes of
its Sept. 21 meeting, when the Federal Open Market Committee
said it was willing to ease monetary policy further.  Gross domestic product will increase 2.6 percent this year
and next, according to the median of 46 economists surveyed by
the  National Association for Business Economics  from Sept. 2 to
Sept. 21. A May poll projected growth of 3.2 percent for both
years. Economists also cut estimates for  personal spending ,
employment and consumer prices.  “If we get through the next six-nine months, the growth
pace is likely to pick up in the remainder of 2011,” Hatzius
wrote. “The pattern should look more encouraging than in
2010.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
