KenolKobil Ltd. , the Kenyan fuel
marketer, said a dispute with Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd.
had been settled and both companies agreed to discontinue all
pending claims against each other.  “With the dispute behind us, both parties are fully
committed to working for the wellbeing of the oil industry in
Kenya and the region,” KenolKobil Chairman  Jacob Segman  said in
a statement to the Nairobi Stock Exchange today.  KenolKobil and KPRL had been in dispute over processing
fees for the past four years. KPRL said it was owed 600 million
shillings ($7.4 million) by KenolKobil, which in turn said it
was owed 5.3 billion shillings as a result of losses incurred
after KPRL withheld refined oil and prevented two ships from
delivering crude ordered by KenolKobil.  KenolKobil, which has a 25 percent market share in  Kenya ,
has operations in six other African countries, including
Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  The company’s  stock  rose 5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 9.95
shillings on the Nairobi Stock Exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
