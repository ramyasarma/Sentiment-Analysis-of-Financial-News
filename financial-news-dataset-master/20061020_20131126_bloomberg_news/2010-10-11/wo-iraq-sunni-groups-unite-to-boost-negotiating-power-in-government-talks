Two Iraqi Sunni Muslim political
groups have united in a bid to boost their negotiating power
during talks on forming a new government.  Sunni leaders announced the creation of the Iraqi Centrist
Alliance at a news conference in Baghdad yesterday, according to
a statement posted today on the websites of Sunni organizations
including the  Iraqi Islamic Party . The coalition includes the
Tawafuq Party and the United Iraq group and holds a combined
total of 10 seats in the 325-member assembly.  Tawafuq and United Iraq aren’t part of Iraqiyah, former
premier  Ayad Allawi ’s mostly Sunni-backed bloc, which took the
most seats in the March 7 parliamentary elections. Sunnis
dominated Saddam Hussein’s regime and since his ouster have been
on the margins of politics. Their participation in a new
government is seen by the U.S. as key to stability and unity.  Iraqiyah won 91 seats to the 89 garnered by Prime Minister
 Nuri al-Maliki ’s Shiite Muslim-led State of Law bloc, though
Allawi has so far been unable to secure more support than al-
Maliki in trying to form a governing coalition of at least 163
seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
