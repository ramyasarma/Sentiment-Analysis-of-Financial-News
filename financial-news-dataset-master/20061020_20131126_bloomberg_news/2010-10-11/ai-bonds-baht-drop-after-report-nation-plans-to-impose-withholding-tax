Thailand’s bonds dropped the most in
almost a year and the baht fell for a second day following a
report that global funds face a tax of 15 percent on interest
income from the nation’s debt.  The cabinet will discuss the measure tomorrow, aimed at
curbing the inflow of funds that pressure the baht to gain, the
Thai-language Post Today newspaper reported, citing Finance
Minister Korn Chatikavanij. The currency last week reached its
strongest level since 1997 as overseas investors pumped money
into stocks and bonds to benefit from the nation’s fastest
economic growth in 15 years.  “People will buy back the dollar if any measures to
control fund inflows are announced,” said  Kozo Hasegawa , a 
Bangkok-based foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “The baht may stay in a narrow range as people are 
probably taking a wait-and-see stance.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent bond maturing in May 2015
jumped 19 basis points, the  most  since November 2009, to 2.75
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Korn, who is
on a visit to the U.S., didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone
today.  Global funds invested a net $1.1 billion in the nation’s
bond market this month after pumping a net $4.9 billion in the
third quarter,  Thai Bond Market Association  data show.  The baht traded at 30.07 per dollar as of 8:36 a.m. in
Bangkok from 30.06 on Oct. 8, after earlier advancing as much as
0.6 percent. The currency may trade between 29.80 and 30.20 this
week, Hasegawa said.  The baht has appreciated nearly 11 percent this year
against the dollar, the best performance among major currencies
in Asia outside Japan, as overseas investors bought $1.6 billion
more Thai shares than they sold during the period. Southeast
Asia’s second-biggest economy had its best two consecutive
quarters of growth since 1995 in the first half.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, climbed to 1.55 percent
from 1.5 percent at the end of last week. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
