Rice futures may surge as much as 36
percent on concern that U.S. crop may be lower than earlier
forecast, Milo Hamilton, president of rice market advisory
service Firstgrain.com, said today.  The price of rough-rice futures may peak at $18 per 100
pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade, Hamilton said at a
conference in Singapore today. The most-active contract gained
1.6 percent to $13.465 per 100 pounds at 12:37 p.m. Singapore
time, extending a five-day winning streak to 10 percent.  “We’ve just begun to rally,” Hamilton said at a
conference in Singapore. “What you have out there is a crop
that’s in trouble,” he said, referring to the U.S. harvest.  Smaller output from the U.S. may limit supplies available
to importers after recent flooding slashed harvests in Pakistan,
the world’s third-largest shipper last year.  The Philippines, the world’s biggest importer, may buy
between 500,000 tons to 600,000 tons in mid-December, said Tom
Slayton, former publisher of Rice Trader, said in a video
address to the same conference today. Indonesia may buy 850,000
tons in the 2010-2011 marketing year, he said.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered on Oct. 8 its
estimate of the U.S. crop to 7.567 million metric tons, from
7.975 million tons a month earlier, on reduced yields. The
nation was forecast by the USDA to overtake Pakistan as the
world’s third-largest shipper this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
