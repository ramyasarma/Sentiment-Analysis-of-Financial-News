What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 40 cents to 45 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government said
U.S. production will be less than forecast a month ago, said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 40 cents to 50 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after the U.S. government reduced its crop forecast
and dry weather threatens yields in South America, Grow said.
Soybean-meal futures may open $15 to $17 higher per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up 0.75 cent to 0.85
cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as surging corn prices increase demand for wheat
in feed rations and dry weather may curtail acreage in the
southern Great Plains in the U.S., Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
