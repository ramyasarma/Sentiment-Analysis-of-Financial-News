Italy’s  FTSE MIB Index  may exit the
sideways trading range of the last month leveraging amid a
“mildly positive tone” stemming from the U.S., according to
Gruppo Banca Sella technical analysts.  The benchmark for Italian stocks has been moving toward the
high end of the 20,000-21,150 range over the last few trading
sessions, Maurizio Milano, chief technical analyst at Banca
Sella in Biella, said today in a telephone interview. If the
measure rises above 21,000-21,150 it may head toward the
critical resistance at 21,650-22,000, given by a so-called
“long black candle” that was formed on April 27.  Candlestick charts show information on opening and closing
prices and the trend within each trading period. If the closing
price is above the open, the candlestick is open, or white,
indicating a bullish trend, but if the close is below the open,
the candlestick is black, or bearish.  “A mildly positive tone in the U.S. is driving the
performance of European equity markets,” Milano said,
highlighting that “with the exception of the DAX Index,
European markets are still performing relatively worse than the
U.S.” In such a context, the FTSE MIB Index remains behind the
lines, challenged by its own composition as Milano expects both
the banking industry and insurers to keep underperforming.  The FTSE MIB Index rose 0.2 percent to 20,785.94 at 12:29
p.m. today in Milan. The gauge advanced 1.8 percent last week,
the biggest gain in more than a month.  A drop below the 20,000 threshold may take the index to
19,250 points and 18,800 afterward. “Below 18,800 the picture
would get very bearish,” Milano said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
