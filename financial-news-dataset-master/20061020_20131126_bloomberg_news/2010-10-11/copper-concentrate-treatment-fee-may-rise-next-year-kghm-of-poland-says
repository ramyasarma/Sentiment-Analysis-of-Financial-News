KGHM Polska Miedz SA , Poland’s only
copper producer, expects to charge more to process other
companies’ raw materials into copper next year because of
reduced smelter capacity.  The fee to smelt copper concentrate at KGHM’s plants in
Poland is expected to be above this year’s $48 a metric ton,
 Maciej Tybura , vice president of the company’s management board,
said in an interview in London on Oct. 9. The cost to refine
metal may also increase above this year’s 4.8 cents a pound,
Tybura said, declining to give specific forecasts. Smelters need
about $45 a ton to break even, he said.  The fees that smelters charge mining companies to process
ore into metal have weakened this year, falling in some cases to
zero, according to researcher CRU. The industry is running at
67 percent of capacity, the lowest level in at least 25 years,
CRU estimates.  Overcapacity and dwindling returns mean some smelters have
already shut. HudBay Minerals Inc. and Xstrata Plc both closed
operations in Canada since May. In India, Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd., the nation’s biggest copper producer, is being
allowed to operate its only smelter until Oct. 18 as the
country’s highest court seeks details on a lower court’s ruling
ordering the plant to close for breaching environment standards.  KGHM buys about 100,000 tons of copper concentrates
annually to produce 30,000 tons of refined metal, he said. Total
copper production is estimated to increase to about 540,000 tons
this year from 502,000 tons last year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
