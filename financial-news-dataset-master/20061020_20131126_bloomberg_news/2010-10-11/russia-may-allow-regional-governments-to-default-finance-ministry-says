Russia will decide on a “case-by-
case” basis whether to bail out regional governments to avoid
defaults, Deputy Finance Minister  Dmitry Pankin  said.  “The situation is serious in a number of regions, but not
everywhere,” Pankin told reporters over the weekend in
Washington, where he took part in the International Monetary
Fund’s annual meeting. “For now, I wouldn’t say that we are
expecting a default.”  Regional governments may default in the next two years as
federal authorities scale back emergency aid provided during the
crisis, Standard & Poor’s said in an Oct. 4 report.  Ruling out allowing a regional government to default would
be “unacceptable,” though the federal government reserves the
right to extend emergency aid, Pankin said. “Of course, we have
support levers, we can provide budget loans,” he said.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  on Aug. 20 said regional and
municipal governments wasted 415 billion rubles ($13.9 billion)
last year on “empty spending.”  Low-interest federal loans granted to finance regional
deficits will be reduced by 20 percent next year after a 15
percent cut in 2010, S&P estimates. Budget loans increased
“several-fold” in 2009 and accounted for almost one-third of
total regional borrowing that year, according to S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
