China’s selling a record amount of
Japanese debt in August is not a political move, the Shanghai
Securities News said today, citing an unidentified official from
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.  The administration is “continuously conducting operations
to dynamically adjust and improve the investment,” said the
newspaper quoting the official.  China cut Japanese debt holdings by a net 2.02 trillion yen
($24.5 billion), the biggest monthly sale in data going back to
2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
