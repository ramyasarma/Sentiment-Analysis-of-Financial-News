European Central Bank council member
Vitor Constancio said that the central bank may decide in the
first quarter of 2011 about whether to withdraw unconventional
tools, Market News International reported.  “We will see what the situation will justify,” Constancio
was cited by MNI as saying in an interview. “We do not pre-
commit. We will see in the first quarter.”  Asked whether the ECB would consider changing its
collateral rules for banks, he said “no, we don’t have anything
in mind right now.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
