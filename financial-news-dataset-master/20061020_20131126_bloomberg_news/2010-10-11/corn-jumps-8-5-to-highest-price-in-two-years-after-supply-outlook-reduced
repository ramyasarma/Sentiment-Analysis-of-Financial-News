Corn rose to a two-year high in
Chicago on signs of tighter supplies after the U.S. Department
of Agriculture forecast smaller crops. Soybeans and wheat also
gained.  Corn for December delivery climbed as much as the daily
limit of 45 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $5.7325 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level since September 2008.
The contract was at $5.72 at 12:04 p.m. Paris time.  The U.S.  corn harvest , the world’s biggest, will fall 3.4
percent from last year after flooding in June and dry weather in
August cut yields, the USDA said in an Oct. 8 report. The agency
cut its estimate for domestic corn stocks at the end of May to
the lowest level since 1997.  “Corn continues to draw strength from the bullish USDA
report,”  Luke Mathews , a Sydney-based commodities strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said by phone. The “USDA
expects U.S. corn supply in 2010-11 to contract to the tightest
level in 15 years.”  The USDA also cut its estimate for the U.S. soybean and
wheat harvests, as well as ending stocks for both crops.  The latest USDA release “has to be one of the more
astoundingly bullish crop reports we’ve seen in many, many
years,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said in his daily newsletter.  Soybeans, Wheat  Soybeans for November delivery rose 3.9 percent to $11.79 a
bushel after climbing as much as 4.4 percent to $11.8475, the
highest since June 5 last year. Wheat for December delivery
gained 1.2 percent to $7.2775 a bushel, paring an advance of as
much as 2.9 percent to $7.3975.  Corn has risen 15 percent in two sessions in Chicago,
soybeans have jumped 11 percent and wheat has added 10 percent.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 1.7 percent to 227.50 euros ($317.14) a metric ton.
Corn for delivery in the same month climbed 2.2 percent to
212.50 euros a ton.  U.S. corn output will be 12.664 billion bushels, down from
13.16 billion projected a month ago and less than last year’s
record 13.11 billion, the USDA said. The average estimate of 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 12.977 billion bushels.  The country’s soybean harvest may be 2.2 percent smaller
than the month-ago forecast after August rains failed to boost
yields. The USDA cut its yield forecast to 44.4 bushels an acre
from 44.7 bushels projected in September, and compared with
analysts’ estimate for a yield of 45 bushels.  “The reduction of acres and yield could signify the need
for higher South American acres and production as well as
intensify the fight for planting acres between corn and soybeans
in the winter and into the spring,” Phillip Futures Pte Ltd.
said in a note today.  Global wheat stockpiles will total 174.66 million tons on
May 31, down 1.8 percent from 177.79 million estimated last
month, the USDA said. The average estimate of 13 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 177.43 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
