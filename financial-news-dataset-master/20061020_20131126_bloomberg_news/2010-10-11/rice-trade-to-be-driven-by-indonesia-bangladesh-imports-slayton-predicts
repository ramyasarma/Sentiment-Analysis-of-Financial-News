Indonesia, the Philippines and
Bangladesh will dominate the rice import market in the fourth
quarter, Tom Slayton, former publisher of the Rice Trader, said
today.  “By my account, Bangladesh has already lined up over a
million tons already. We’re certainly going to see very heavy
shipments to Bangladesh in the current quarter,” Slayton said
in a video conference from the U.S.  Indonesia may buy 850,000 metric tons of rice in the
2010-2011 marketing year, Slayton said. The Philippines may
start public tenders to buy rice in November, and potentially
buy between 500,000 tons to 600,000 tons in mid-December, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
