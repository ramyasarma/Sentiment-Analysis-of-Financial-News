Cableuropa SAU , the operating unit
of Spanish cable television company Grupo Corportivo Ono SA,
plans to raise 500 million euros ($695 million) from the sale
eight-year high-yield bonds.  The bonds will be used to repay loans in the 3.3 billion-
euro senior debt facility that Madrid-based Ono used to finance
its acquisition of the fixed-line unit of Grupo Auna in 2005,
according to a company  statement . The senior secured notes are
callable after three years and will be sold through Nara Cable
Funding Ltd., a financing unit of Ono.  Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA,
Credit Agricole CIB, Banco Santander SA, Societe Generale SA are
global coordinators for the issue, according to three people
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Cableuropa’s proposed senior secured bonds will be rated
BB- by Fitch Ratings, three levels below investment grade
status.  Lenders to Ono agreed in April to amend terms of its loans,
including delaying loan repayments to 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
