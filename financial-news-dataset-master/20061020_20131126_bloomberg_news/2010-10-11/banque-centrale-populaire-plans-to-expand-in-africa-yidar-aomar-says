Banque Centrale Populaire , the third-
largest publicly traded bank in Morocco, is planning to expand
in French-speaking Africa, Deputy General Manager Yidar Aomar
said.  “We have several plans to expand in targeted places like
francophone countries,” Aomar said in an interview in
Casablanca on Oct. 8. “We already successfully managed for
three decades to answer specific needs for people in this
area.”  Banque Centrale Populaire operates Banque Populaire Maroco-
Centrafricaine in the Central African Republic and Banque
Populaire Maroco-Guineenne in Guinea. In Mauritania, a country
of 3 million people, Attijariwafa Bank, Morocco’s biggest
publicly traded bank, received regulatory approval in 2008 to
set up a commercial banking division in conjunction with Banque
Centrale.  Banque Centrale said in September its profit rose 11
percent in the first half of this year to 835 million Moroccan
dirhams ($105.2 million). Revenue increased 25 percent to 1.7
billion dirhams.  Shares  of Banque Centrale gained 0.2 percent to 370.75
dirhams at 11:07 a.m. in Casablanca, valuing the company at 24.5
billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
