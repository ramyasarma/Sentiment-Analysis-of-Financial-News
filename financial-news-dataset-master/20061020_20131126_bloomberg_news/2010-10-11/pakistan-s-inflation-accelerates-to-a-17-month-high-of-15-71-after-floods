Pakistan’s inflation accelerated to
a 17-month high after the nation’s deadliest floods damaged
crops and washed away roads and bridges, hurting supplies of
farm and manufactured goods.  Consumer  prices  rose 15.71 percent in September from a year
earlier after climbing 13.23 percent in August, the statistics
department said on its  website  today. The median of 16 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 15.1 percent gain.  “The impact of the floods on inflation is now on in full
swing,”  Suleman Akhtar , an economist at Foundation Securities
Ltd. in Karachi, said before the announcement. “If the
situation remains the same next month the central bank may
further tighten the monetary policy.”  Pakistan’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate
in September for the second time in two months to cool
inflation, which Governor  Shahid Kardar  said is his primary
task. Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani  estimates the
floods may stoke inflation to as high as 20 percent and curb
economic expansion to 2.5 percent in the year through June.  The State Bank of Pakistan’s key discount rate is 13.5
percent.  The floods, which struck on July 22, destroyed $3.3 billion
of crops, according to government estimates. Pakistan will
harvest 4.4 million metric tons of rice in the 12 months
starting Nov. 1, down 35 percent from the previous year,
according to a report by a unit of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  Gilani said Sept. 1 the natural disaster swept away 4,000
kilometers of roads and 1,000 bridges, pushing up the cost of
delivering goods and services. He estimated the inflation rate
to climb to between 15 percent and 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
