Saudi Arabia’s budget deficit may
narrow to about 0.5 percent of gross domestic product this year
as revenue rises, Banque Saudi Fransi said.  The gap will probably be 8.4 billion riyals ($2.2 billion),
 John Sfakianakis , the bank’s chief economist, wrote in an e-
mailed report yesterday. Last year’s deficit was 86.6 billion
riyals, or more than 10 percent of GDP, according to data from
the kingdom’s central bank. It was the first time Saudi Arabia,
the world’s biggest oil supplier, had posted a deficit since
2002, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Government revenue may increase 25 percent this year to
639.6 billion riyals, Sfakianakis said. Still, higher spending
will make it hard for the kingdom to return to budget surpluses
this year or next “unless there is a decent turnaround in
energy demand globally,” he said.  Saudi Arabia is spending revenue earned from crude exports
to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons and create jobs.
The kingdom in August approved a five-year, $385 billion
development plan, targeting average growth of 5.2 percent a year
through 2014.  The plan is based on private sector growth averaging an
annual 6.6 percent over the five year period, Sfakianakis wrote.
The private sector will “struggle” to exceed 5 percent growth
in the coming years without a “substantial upsurge in foreign
investment,” he said.  Banque Saudi revised its estimate for Saudi economic
expansion to 3.8 percent from 3.9 percent this year and
increased its forecast for growth in the private sector to 4
percent from 3.7 percent.  “One worrying trend for the Saudi economy is the
acceleration in inflation to above 6 percent in August -- the
highest rate in the Gulf,” Sfakianakis wrote. “Food price
inflation has been accelerating quickly this year.”  Banque Saudi Fransi forecasts an inflation rate of 5.3
percent this year, up from 5.1 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
