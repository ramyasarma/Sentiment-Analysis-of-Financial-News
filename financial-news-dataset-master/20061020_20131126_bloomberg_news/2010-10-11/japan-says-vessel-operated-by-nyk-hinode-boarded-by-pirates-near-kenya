A Panama-registered ship with 20
crew on board was hijacked by pirates yesterday near Kenya,
Japan’s transport ministry said, citing information received
from a vessel traveling nearby.  Communication had broken down with the Izumi, a multi-
purpose cargo ship operated by Nippon Yusen K.K unit NYK-Hinode
Line Ltd., as of 5 p.m. today, the ministry said in a faxed
statement. It is the 11th case of piracy against a Japanese ship
this year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
