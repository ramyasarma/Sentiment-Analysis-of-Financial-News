Deutsche Bank AG advised investors
to buy Italian and Spanish two-year notes versus so-called core
European government debt securities as concern fades that the
region’s sovereign debt crisis will infect the nations.  There is “far less concern about a systemic problem in
euro-area sovereigns today,”  Abhishek Singhania , a London-based
strategist, wrote in a report dated Oct. 8. “The larger
peripherals such as Italy and Spain still offer considerable
carry over funding costs.”  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Italian two-year
notes instead of similar-maturity German debt narrowed 8 basis
points to 86 basis points as of 10:52 a.m. in London. The
 difference in yield  between Spanish and German notes fell 5
basis points to 122 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
