Portuguese banks’ financing from the
European Central Bank fell 19 percent in September, the first
decline since January, the  Bank of Portugal  said today.  ECB financing for Portuguese banks dropped to 39.7 billion
euros ($55.3 billion) at the end of last month from 49.1 billion
euros in August, the Bank of Portugal said on its website. It
increased 0.6 percent in August.  European policy makers, including Portugal’s ECB Governing
council member  Carlos Costa , have expressed unease about some
banks’ reliance on central bank liquidity, which has already
forced the ECB to delay its exit from non-standard measures to
give banks time to patch up their balance sheets.  Portugal’s banks “need to have access to alternative
sources of financing to be able to reduce their dependence on
the Eurosystem liquidity operations,” Costa said on Oct. 4.
They are “captives of sovereign risk,” he said.  While the ECB has phased out its 12- and 6-month loans, it
still lends unlimited amounts in its weekly, monthly and three-
month tenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
