Olympic Group Financial Investments 
surged the most on record after  Electrolux AB , Europe’s largest
appliance maker, agreed to buy a 52 percent stake in the
Egyptian washing-machine manufacturer.  The shares of the Cairo-based company jumped 37 percent,
the biggest gain since at least October 1997 when Bloomberg
began tracking the shares, to 41.18 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30
p.m. close in Cairo. That valued the company at 2.47 billion
pounds ($434 million). Stockholm-based Electrolux, the owner of
the Frigidaire brand, will pay Olympic’s majority shareholder
Paradise Capital Holding 45.3 pounds a share.  “It’s a win-win situation for the investors considering
the premium Electrolux paid,” said  Hamed Hesham , equity analyst
at Cairo-based investment bank Beltone Financial. “Relative to
its peers, it is a bit expensive but Olympic deserves this given
they are operating in an underdeveloped market with large growth
potential.”  Paradise owns  52 percent  of Olympic as of Dec. 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
