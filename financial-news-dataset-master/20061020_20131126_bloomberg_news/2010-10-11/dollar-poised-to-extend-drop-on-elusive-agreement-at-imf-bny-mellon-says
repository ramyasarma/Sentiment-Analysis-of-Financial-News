The dollar may decline this week as
currency-market “pressures” intensify after leaders of the
world economy failed to narrow differences at an International
Monetary Fund meeting, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said.  “Heightened dollar weakness, increased capital flows into
emerging markets, increased intervention (possibly from Japan as
well) and diversification will be the order of the day,”  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist in London, said today in an
e-mailed note. “Battle lines” between the U.S. and China on
currency policy “are becoming ever more clearly defined,”
Derrick wrote, meaning “the likelihood of an agreement being
reached by early November seems very low.”  The dollar was little changed against the euro at $1.3946
as of 11:22 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
