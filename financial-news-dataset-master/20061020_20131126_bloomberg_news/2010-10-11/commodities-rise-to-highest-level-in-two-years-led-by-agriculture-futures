Commodities rose to the highest in
two years, led by agriculture futures, after a U.S. Department
of Agriculture report last week showed corn production in the
country would decline more than expected by analysts.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 1.3 percent to 571.4810, the highest level since Oct.
3, 2008. The  UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index 
climbed to 1,490.731, the highest since Aug. 27, 2008. Corn
futures gained as much as 8.5 percent and soybeans jumped to a
16-month high.  U.S. corn production will total 12.664 billion bushels, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said Oct. 8. That’s below the
average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News for
12.977 billion bushels. Yields will be 155.8 bushels an acre,
the USDA said, compared with analysts’ forecast of 160.2 bushels
an acre.  “Friday’s news has been exceptionally bullish for the
markets,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an agricultural
commodities analyst for Barclays Capital in London. “If one
looks at current prices, I don’t think we’re close to peaks.
There is still further upside from the current levels.”  Corn futures for December delivery surged 42.75 cents, or
8.1 percent, to $5.71 a bushel at 10:34 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has gained 23 percent since
Oct. 1.  Barclays forecast the grain’s fourth-quarter average price
at $5.24 a bushel before the report, Unnikrishnan said. The
first quarter average was expected to be about $5.40 a bushel.  ‘See a Scramble’  Soybeans for November delivery rose 43.5 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $11.785 a bushel in Chicago. The price has jumped 7
percent this month. Wheat futures for December delivery gained 8
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $7.2725 a bushel.  With corn prices rising, more growers will plant the grain
instead of soybeans and wheat, Unnikrishnan said.  “The fact that corn prices are looking more attractive, we
could see a scramble for acres tilting in favor of corn,”
Unnikrishnan said. “We see soybean prices needing to push up in
terms of planting. In feed substitution with wheat, prices need
to push up.”  Sugar for March delivery gained 0.88 cent, or 3.3 percent,
to 27.2 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
earlier touched 27.24 cents a pound, the highest in almost eight
months, on speculation that crops in Brazil, the world’s largest
supplier of the sweetener, will be harmed by drought that lasted
through mid-September.  Silver for immediate delivery jumped as much as 1.6 percent
to $23.6325 an ounce, the highest since March 13, 1980. Silver
for December delivery gained 0.8 percent, also extending a rally
to a 30-year high.  Gold for immediate delivery rose $1.86, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,348.60 an ounce. Futures for December delivery climbed $6.70,
or 0.5 percent, to $1,347 an ounce. The most-active contract has
gained 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
