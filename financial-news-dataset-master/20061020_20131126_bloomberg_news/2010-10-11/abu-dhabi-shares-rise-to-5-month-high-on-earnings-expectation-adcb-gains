Abu Dhabi  shares  advanced to the
highest in almost five months on speculation third-quarter
earnings in the United Arab Emirates will beat expectations and
after global markets and oil rallied. Qatar’s index rose.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC , the third-largest lender in
the U.A.E. by assets, and  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.,  the
state-run utility known as Taqa, soared to their highest levels
in a year. The  ADX General Index  increased 0.7 percent to
2,721.68, the highest since May 24, at the 2 p.m. close in Abu
Dhabi. Qatar’s  QE Index  climbed to the highest in two years,
rising 0.8 percent.  “The third-quarter earnings season has started reasonably
well in the region,” said  Paul Cooper , managing director at
Sarasin-Alpen & Partners Ltd. in Dubai, which oversees more than
$500 million in the Middle East. “The international backdrop is
positive.”  Saudi Hotels & Resort Areas Co.  rose as much as 2.2 percent
to 27.6 riyals, before closing at 27.1 riyals. The operator of
hotels and housing compounds in the kingdom yesterday said
third-quarter profit more than doubled to 32.6 million riyals
($8.7 million).  Advanced Petrochemicals Co. , gained 4.6 percent
to 23.75 riyals, the highest since May 5. The company said
yesterday third-quarter profit rose to 121.1 million riyals from
20.8 million riyals. That sent the shares 9.9 percent higher.  European and emerging-market equities along with U.S.
futures advanced after the Group of Seven industrialized nations
did nothing to damp optimism central banks will step in to
support economies.  Earnings Forecast  Crude for November delivery gained as much as 1 percent to
$83.50 a barrel in New York. Oil traded lower at $82.24 a barrel
at 4:51 p.m. in Dubai. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  ADCB jumped 4.2 percent to 2.49 dirhams, the highest since
October 2009. The bank’s third-quarter earnings may surge more
than ninefold to 329 million dirhams ($90 million), according to
the mean of three analyst estimates on Bloomberg.  Taqa increased for a fourth day, climbing 6.4 percent to
1.49 dirhams, also the highest since October last year.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  decreased 0.2 percent. Dubai’s
 DFM General Index  advanced 0.3 percent to the highest since
April 26. Kuwait’s  gauge  fell less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s
 MSM30 Index  retreated 0.2 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge  was little
changed while Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  declined
0.8 percent, the most since Aug. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
