Asian  stocks  rose, with material and
energy companies leading a regional gauge to a two-year high, on
speculation the U.S. will join Japan and Australia in acting to
shore up a fragile global economic recovery.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company,
gained 1.1 percent as oil and metal prices rallied. Korea Zinc
Co., which produces gold and silver, advanced 2.9 percent in
Seoul. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. jumped 10 percent in Shanghai.
Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. climbed 4.7 percent after signaling
higher profit.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. , Australia’s third-
largest iron-ore exporter, surged 7.8 percent in Sydney after
securing bank funding.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.5
percent to 460.98 at 6:22 p.m. in Hong Kong after a larger-than-
estimated cut in U.S. jobs stoked optimism the Fed will
intensify action to bolster the economy. The gauge, which is at
its highest level since June 2008, advanced 2 percent last week
after Japan’s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and
Australia unexpectedly kept its key rate unchanged.  “Further quantitative easing will hopefully stimulate
economic activity to where the recovery is self-sustaining,”
said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “That would bolster the
outlook for jobs creation, higher consumption and earnings
growth, and give a positive impetus to equity valuations.”  Material Stocks  Material, energy and consumer stocks had the biggest gains
among the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan
gauge. The index has rallied 30 percent from this year’s May 25
low amid signs a U.S. recovery is regaining momentum and that
China’s economic expansion will continue.  The S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent as a statistics
bureau report showed Australian home-loan approvals rose in
August from a month earlier.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  advanced 1.2 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.5 percent as China’s materials
producers surged. South Korea’s  Kospi  index slipped 0.4 percent
and Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped 0.8 percent. Japanese markets
are closed for a public holiday.  Futures on the U.S.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.2
percent today. The gauge climbed 0.6 percent to 1,165.15 in New
York on Oct. 8 as the jobs report fueled speculation the Fed
would do more to ensure a lasting recovery.  U.S. employers cut 95,000 jobs in September, Labor
Department figures showed. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 5,000 drop. The  dollar  fell
below 82 yen for the first time since 1995, while the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed to the
highest level in almost two years.  Oil, Copper  BHP Billiton , also Australia’s largest oil producer,
increased 1.1 percent to A$41.45 in Sydney.  Rio Tinto Group , the
world’s third-biggest mining company, rose 0.7 percent to
A$80.09.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s largest gold producer,
climbed 0.6 percent to A$42.16. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s
largest gold producer, surged 5.1 percent to HK$7.80.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 2.6 percent to a
27-month high on Oct. 8 in New York, while gold futures for
December delivery gained 0.8 percent to settle at $1,345.30.
Crude oil for November delivery advanced 1.2 percent to settle
at $82.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  “Further quantitative easing will boost short-term
liquidity, which should find its way into financial markets,”
said  Prasad Patkar , who helps manage about $1.8 billion at
Platypus Asset Management in Sydney. “It should also support
broader economic activity in the longer term. The rising supply
of dollars in the system will increase demand for hard assets
like commodities and precious metals as a store of value.”  U.S. Employment  Korea Zinc climbed 2.9 percent to 298,000 won in Seoul,
while  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s largest offshore oil producer,
advanced 4.5 percent to HK$16.80 in Hong Kong. In Shanghai,
Yanzhou Coal jumped 10 percent to 22.21 yuan and Jiangxi Copper
Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal, soared 10 percent to
37.64 yuan.  “The U.S. jobs data was basically a win-win for
equities,” said  Chris Weston , a Melbourne-based institutional
dealer at IG Markets. “If it was better, we’d have seen a rally
in risk, but as we saw a worse-than-expected number, it again
heightened the need for stimulus. Fed liquidity into markets
helps inflate asset prices, providing a solid platform for
equities to rally in the short term.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index  has risen 11 percent
this year on speculation growth in corporate profits will
weather Europe’s debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-
price inflation and concern about the pace of the U.S. economic
rebound. Stocks in the gauge trade at 13.9 times estimated
profit on average, equal with shares in the  S&P 500  and compared
with 12.1 times for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Fortescue Funding  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. climbed 4.7 percent to 7.11 yuan
after indicating higher profit. The Chinese steelmaker said net
income for the first nine months may have risen by between 170
percent and 190 percent from a year ago, more than earlier
forecast.  Fortescue Metals  surged 7.8 percent to A$6.25 in Sydney
after signing a more-than $2 billion loan agreement to expand
mining operations. The loan, agreed with JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, replaces project-based
notes and matures in 2015. The refinancing will let Fortescue
expand projects in Western Australia, Chief Executive Officer
 Andrew Forrest  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
