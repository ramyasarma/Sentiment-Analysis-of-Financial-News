The Romanian  inflation  rate in
September rose more than economists expected to the fastest pace
in more than two years as food and services prices increased
after the government raised the value-added tax .  The rate rose to 7.8 percent, the highest since August
2008, from 7.6 percent in August, the Bucharest-based  National
Statistics Institute  said in an e-mail today. The median
estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 7.6
percent rate. On the month, prices advanced 0.6 percent.  Romania, which turned to the International Monetary Fund
and the European Union for a 20 billion-euro ($28 billion)
bailout during the worst recession in 20 years, raised the VAT
by 5 points from July to 24 percent to meet an IMF-agreed budget
deficit target of 6.8 percent of gross domestic product this
year and 4.4 percent in 2011.  The central bank forecasts inflation will end the year at
7.8 percent, before slowing to 3.1 percent in 2011 as the one-
time impact of the VAT increase dissipates, Governor Mugur
Isarescu said on Aug. 6.  “We expect year-end inflation to be slightly below 8
percent on the grounds that the presence of the significant
economic slack should contain the possible second-round effects
of the VAT hike,” Citigroup Inc. economists  Ilker Domac  and
Gultekin Isiklar wrote in a note today before the inflation
report. “A weaker-than-expected leu would complicate inflation
dynamics, given the close link between inflation expectations
and the exchange rate” and ’’a reversal in food prices, which
have remained favourable so far, could make the central bank’s
job more difficult.’’  Food price inflation accelerated an annual 4.8 percent in
September compared with a gain of 3.8 percent in August, the
institute said. Prices for services rose an annual 6.4 percent
last month from 6.2 percent in August and non-food prices gained
10.7 percent from 11.25 percent the previous month, according to
the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
