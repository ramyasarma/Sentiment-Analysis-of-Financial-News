Lime Brokerage Holdings LLC, a New
York-based firm that gives high-frequency traders access to U.S.
markets, said  Jeffrey Wecker  resigned as chief executive officer
and president on Oct. 4.  The departure was confirmed by  John Jacobs , Lime’s chief
operations officer. Wecker left to pursue other interests and
was replaced by  Alistair Brown , the co-founder and chairman of
Lime, Jacobs said.  Lime’s platform allows professional traders whose
strategies depend on speed to receive quotation, trading data
and exchange access. Its customers account for 3 percent to 5
percent of U.S. equities trading, Wecker said in an interview in
September. The firm also provides algorithms, or trading
strategies that execute orders in pieces, to customers such as
mutual funds and hedge funds.  The company, founded in 2000 and owned by Lime Group,
introduced a platform for customers to trade U.S. options this
year. Lime began testing its options execution platform in the
last few months. It already had a system to give customers rapid
access to equity derivatives market data.  Wecker joined Lime Brokerage in 2008. He previously was
chief executive officer of Townsend Analytics Inc., a subsidiary
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. that provides mutual funds and
other customers with a trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
