The yields on Egypt’s three- and
six-month notes fell to the lowest levels since May 2008 at
yesterday’s auction as shrinking returns in developed economies
pushed investors to move funds to emerging markets.  The average yields on the country’s  three-month  and  six-
month  certificates dropped to 8.916 percent and 9.556 percent,
respectively, the central bank said on its website today.  “Low yields in developed countries are pushing investors
to look for opportunities elsewhere,”  Khalil El Bawab , head of
fixed income at Cairo-based EFG-Hermes Asset Management, said in
a telephone interview today. “Egypt’s stable economy is driving
the buying by foreigners who are also speculating the Egyptian
pound will appreciate against the dollar.”  The economy of the North African country expanded 5.3
percent in the fiscal year through June, compared with 4.7
percent in the previous 12 months. The central bank kept its
benchmark overnight deposit interest rate at a four-year low of
8.25 percent in September. Emerging-market bond funds took in
$39.5 billion this year, according to a report by Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global on Oct. 1.  U.S. Treasury five-year yields declined to a record 1.0686
percent on Oct. 8 as the employment figures fueled speculation
the Federal Reserve is about to increase its debt purchases, a
strategy know as quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
