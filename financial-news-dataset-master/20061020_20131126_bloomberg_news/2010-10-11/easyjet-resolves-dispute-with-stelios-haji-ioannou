EasyJet Plc  resolved a brand-license
dispute with founder  Stelios Haji-Ioannou , giving Europe’s
second-largest discount airline greater freedom to boost revenue
through marketing deals with other travel companies.  The airline will retain the right to the EasyJet name for
as long as 50 years, with a minimum commitment of 10 years, by
paying an annual royalty of 0.25 percent of total revenue, fixed
at 3.9 million pounds ($6.2 million) and 4.95 million pounds in
the first and second years, EasyJet said today in a statement.
The Luton, England-based company reported sales of 2.67 billion
pounds in the last fiscal year.  Stelios, who prefers to be known by his first name, alleged
that EasyJet had infringed on an agreement it signed with his
EasyGroup holding company in November 2000, shortly before the
 airline ’s initial offering of shares to investors. The dispute
centered on whether the carrier was violating terms of the
contract specifying that at least 75 percent of sales must come
from airline operations.  “We see this as a new chapter in working with EasyGroup
going forward,” EasyJet Chief Executive Officer  Carolyn McCall 
said today on a conference call with reporters. “It gives us
more freedom to use the brand.”  EasyJet’s other investors, who must approve the agreement,
are “very supportive,” McCall said. The executive, who became
CEO in July, said the dispute with Stelios, the carrier’s
biggest shareholder, had cost the company about 4 million pounds
in legal fees.  Strategy Review  EasyJet  rose  2.7 pence, or 0.6 percent, to 454.3 pence in
London trading today, boosting the company’s market value to
1.95 billion pounds.  The stock has  risen  29 percent this year, propelled by its
biggest gain in 20 months on Oct. 6, when the company said full-
year profit beat its forecasts. EasyJet will report earnings for
the year ended Sept. 30 on Nov. 16, when McCall will also
present a strategy review.  Today’s agreement gives EasyJet greater scope to market its
brand name and allows it to enter into new agreements with car-
rental companies, hotels and travel-insurance providers, as well
as conduct promotions with other companies.  “The way that low-cost airlines make money has changed
over the last 10 years since the original license was signed,”
Stelios said in the statement. “This amendment allows the
airline to now grow its business even further by removing some
of the restrictions imposed by the original agreement.”  Stelios, 43, also agreed to give up the right to appoint
himself chairman of EasyJet and to end EasyGroup’s
representation on the airline’s board, the company said. The
entrepreneur  owns  about 36 percent of EasyJet, according to
EasyGroup, including a portion through the holding company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
