Hong Kong  stocks  rose, pushing the
benchmark index to its highest close in more than two years, as
developers gained ahead of a land auction tomorrow. Oil and
commodity producers advanced along with crude and metal prices.  Sino Land Co., controlled by billionaire  Robert Ng , gained
1 percent. Cnooc Ltd. increased 4.5 percent after China’s No. 1
offshore oil producer agreed to pay $1.08 billion for a stake in
a gas project in Texas. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
nation’s largest producer of the metal, advanced 4.3 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 1.2 percent to 23,207.31, its
highest close since June 2008. The gauge’s 14-day  relative-
strength index  of price momentum was at 82, above the 70 level
considered by some traders as a sell signal. That’s the RSI’s
highest level since October 2007, when the Hang Seng Index
closed at a record 31,638.22.  “Developers are boosted by short-term news such as the
land auction,” said  Steven Leung , director of institutional
sales at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It’s generally agreed
that stock markets will do well in the fourth quarter, but
having said that, with the Hang Seng breaking through the 23,000
level, that seems a bit rushed.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies rose 1.5 percent to 12,951.90.  The Hang Seng Index has more than doubled from its October
2008 low, reached in the wake of the failures of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. Stocks in the measure trade
at an average 14.9 times  estimated earnings , the highest level
since January.  Home Sales  Sino Land gained 1 percent to HK$16.40. Henderson Land
Development Co., the developer controlled by billionaire  Lee Shau-kee , climbed 0.8 percent to HK$56.40.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the world’s biggest developer
by market value, rose 0.8 percent to HK$138.20. The developer
sold about 250 homes at a project in Sheung Shui district in 10
days, generating more than HK$8 billion ($1 billion) of sales.  Hong Kong’s auction of a residential site in the city’s
Kowloon Tong district may fetch as much as HK$1.5 billion, said
Centaline Property Agency Ltd., the city’s largest closely held
real-estate broker.  Hong Kong’s government has in the past year announced a
series of measures to rein in home prices that have surged amid
record-low mortgage rates and an influx of mainland Chinese
buyers. Chief Executive  Donald Tsang  may announce new subsidies
for homebuyers in his Oct. 13 policy address to quell concerns
that housing is becoming unaffordable, said Wong Leung-sing, a
research director at Centaline.  Gas Purchase  “The general consensus is that there will not be big
policy change for the property market,” UOB-Kay Hian’s Leung
said. “That would be good for developers because policies are
nothing to worry about.”  Cnooc  increased 4.5 percent to HK$16.80. The company agreed
to pay $1.08 billion in cash for a one-third stake in Chesapeake
Energy Corp.’s Eagle Ford shale gas project in Texas. Cnooc
International Ltd., a unit of Cnooc, plans to purchase a third
of Chesapeake’s 600,000 oil and natural gas leasehold acres in
the project, the two companies said.  Chalco, as Aluminum Corp. is known, advanced 4.3 percent to
HK$7.84.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s biggest producer of the
metal, jumped 4.4 percent to HK$21.35.  Oil, Metals Advance  The  London Metal Exchange Index  of prices for six metals
including copper and aluminum climbed 2.8 percent on Oct. 8.  Crude oil futures for November delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$82.66 a barrel on Oct. 8, and gained as much as 1 percent in
after-hours trading in New York today.  Zijin Mining Group Co. , China’s largest gold producer, rose
5.1 percent to HK$7.80, adding to a 12 percent rally on Oct. 8.
Zhaojin Mining Industry Co., the No. 2 producer, increased 3
percent to HK$26.  Immediate-delivery bullion climbed as much as 0.7 percent
to $1,355.65 an ounce, approaching an Oct. 7 record of $1,364.77.  Great Harvest Maeta Group Holdings Ltd., which provides
marine transportation services, gained 3.5 percent to HK$1.17 on
its first day of trading.  Winsway Coking Coal Holdings Ltd., which processes and
transports steelmaking material from Mongolia into China, fell
8.7 percent to HK$3.38 on its debut.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 1.7 percent to 23,280.
All but seven of the measure’s 45 constituents gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
