China’s consumer discretionary
stocks are attractive as incomes rise and the economy relies

Management Company LLC.  Higher Chinese interest rates won’t be a deterrent because
consumption growth is based more on higher incomes than on
credit, he said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
