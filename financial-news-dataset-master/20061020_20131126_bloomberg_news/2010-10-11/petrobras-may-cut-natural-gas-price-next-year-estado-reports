Petroleo Brasileiro SA  is studying
cutting the price it charges distributors for natural gas next
year, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, without saying where it got
the information.  A price cut would reduce the difference between national
rates and Bolivian imports, the newspaper said. Petrobras, as
the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known, sells natural gas at
an average of $8.73 per million British thermal units, Estado
said. Gas produced in Brazil costs about $10.50 per million Btu,
while the Bolivian imports cost $7.50, Estado said.   Petrobras will renegociate its contracts in the event of
excess supply, Estado said, citing a note from the company. The
interlinking of gas pipelines in Brazil will also put an end to
price differences, Petrobras said, according to Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
