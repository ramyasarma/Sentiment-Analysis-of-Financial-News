European Central Bank governing
council member  Yves Mersch  said euro region data for the third
quarter point to a “positive surprise” of economic growth of
0.4 percent to 0.6 percent, Financial Times Deutschland said.  The euro region’s effective exchange rate wasn’t higher in
the third quarter than in the three months ended June, Mersch
told the newspaper in an interview, adding the focus shouldn’t
be on bilateral exchange rates alone. The region’s economy is
still supported by a “very accommodating” monetary policy,
Mersch said.  Credit lending has more or less “reached a turning
point,” Mersch said. The ECB will conduct its monetary policy
independently of policy decisions in other countries, he said.
Governments must increase their efforts to save troubled banks
in their jurisdictions as it’s not the ECB’s job to support
“individual banks” or “individual countries,” he said.  European governments should consider allowing the  European
Financial Stability Facility  to buy government bonds in the
future, Mersch said. The EFSF should be extended beyond 2013 and
assume a similar role for the euro region as the International
Monetary Fund does globally, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
