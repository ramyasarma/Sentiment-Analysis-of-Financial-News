Sachin Tendulkar  hit his record-
extending 49th Test century to take India to within 43 runs of
Australia’s first-innings 478 in the second cricket Test.  Tendulkar was 191 not out as the home team reached 435-5 at
stumps on the third day at Bangalore. It’s the 37-year-old
right-hander’s sixth hundred in 2010.  Tendulkar struck 22 boundaries in his unbeaten 319-ball
innings and brought up his century with a second six off spin
bowler  Nathan Hauritz . It moved him 10 clear of Australia
captain  Ricky Ponting  atop the list of century-makers in Tests.  Murali Vijay  made his first Test century, totaling 139
before he was caught behind off  Mitchell Johnson . He and
Tendulkar put on 308 for the third wicket.  Mahendra Singh Dhoni 
is 11 not out.  India is seeking to wrap up the two-Test series after
winning the first match by one wicket.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
