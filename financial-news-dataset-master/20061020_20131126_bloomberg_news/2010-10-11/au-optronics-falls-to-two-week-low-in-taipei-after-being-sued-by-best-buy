AU Optronics Corp., Taiwan’s second-
largest flat-panel maker, fell to the lowest in two weeks in
Taipei trading after Best Buy Co. sued the company and at least
nine other liquid crystal display makers over antitrust claims,
according to the complaint filed in federal court in San
Francisco on Oct. 8.     The stock declined 1 percent to NT$30.40 as of 9.09 a.m.,
set for the lowest since Sept. 24. Yawen Hsiao, an AU Optronics
spokeswoman, couldn’t be reached immediately for comment.   To contact the reporter on this story:
