Greek bonds rose after International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said the
lending institution is ready to give the nation more time to
repay loans should European countries do so first.  The extra premium, or spread, investors demand to hold
Greek 10-year bonds over benchmark German bunds shrank below 700
basis points for the first time since June 22. Greek officials
are doing “exactly what they need to do” to rein in spending
and meet benchmarks set out as a condition of aid, Strauss-Kahn
said in a television interview with Bloomberg HT yesterday.  “We are continuing to hear good news from the likes of
Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece in terms of budgetary
transparency, and that’s driving spreads tighter,” said  Orlando Green , assistant director of capital-markets strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The more time
Greece has to repay its IMF loans, the better.”  Greek 10-year bond yields fell 49 basis points to 9.28
percent as of 5:31 p.m. in London. The 6.25 percent security due
June 2020 gained 2.62, or 20.62 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,394)
face amount, to 81.03. The yield spread over bunds narrowed 51
basis points to 701 basis points, Bloomberg generic data shows.  German 10-year bund yields were 1 basis point higher at
2.27 percent. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.79
percent. The Spanish-German yield spread narrowed 3 basis points
to 171 basis points. The Portuguese-German spread fell 11 points
to 387 points and the Irish spread dropped 5 points to 417.  German Opposition  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government opposes any move to
grant Greece more time for repayment, the German Finance
Ministry said.  Any such move would be “premature” given that Greece
needs to show it can implement its deficit-reduction program
over time and ensure there is “no doubt” about the quality of
its statistics,  Bertrand Benoit , a spokesman for the ministry,
said by phone today.  Portuguese banks’ financing from the European Central Bank
declined 19 percent to 39.7 billion euros in September from
August, the Bank of Portugal said today. Borrowing by Irish-
based credit institutions, including international and domestic
companies, increased to 119.1 billion euros as of Sept. 24 from
95.1 billion euros at the end of July, the central bank said at
the end of last week.  ‘Buy Peripheral Bonds’  Deutsche Bank AG advised investors to buy Italian and
Spanish two-year notes versus so-called core European government
debt securities as concern fades that the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis will spread to the two Mediterranean nations.  There is “far less concern about a systemic problem in
euro-area sovereigns today,”  Abhishek Singhania , a London-based
strategist, wrote in a report dated Oct. 8. “The larger
peripherals such as Italy and Spain still offer considerable
carry over funding costs.”  Morgan Stanley last week recommended buying Spanish,
Italian and French government bonds, while staying short, or
betting on a decline, in Irish and Portuguese debt.  “Two-way risk has returned to peripherals spreads, in our
view, prompting us to recommend a tactical reduction in
underweights,”  Laurence Mutkin , a managing director at Morgan
Stanley & Co. International in London, wrote in the note
published Oct. 8. “There are now significant risks to being
underweight Spain, Italy and France, because of their yields,
volatilities and weights in the index.”  German Bill Sale  German borrowing costs rose at a sale of 4.5 billion euros
of 6-month Treasury bills today after money-market rates
increased following weaker demand at a European Central Bank
tender last month. Germany’s federal government sold the bills
at an average yield of 0.614 percent, compared with 0.4148
percent at the last sale on Sept. 13.  Euribor and  eonia  rates, which measure how much lenders
charge each other for loans, jumped after banks demanded 104
billion euros of 3-month loans from the ECB on Sept. 29 and 225
billion euros of longer-term loans matured. Three-month  Euribor 
climbed to 0.977 percent today, according to the European
Banking Federation, the most since July 15, 2009.  Slovakia sold 149.3 million euros of floating-rate bonds
due Oct. 2013 today for an average price of 98.259. The sale
attracted bids worth 4.02 times the securities offered, the Debt
and Liquidity Management Agency said.  German bonds have returned 2.2 percent since June 30,
compared with 3.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 4 percent for
U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
