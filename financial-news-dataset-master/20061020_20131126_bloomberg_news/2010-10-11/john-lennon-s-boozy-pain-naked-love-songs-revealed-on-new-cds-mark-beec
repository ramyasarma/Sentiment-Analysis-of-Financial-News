John Lennon  thrives, at least when
it comes to the industry surrounding him.  The former Beatle was shot dead in 1980, aged 40. He would
have celebrated his 70th birthday on Oct. 9 this year. Apart
from the television specials, books, new monuments and “Nowhere
Boy” movie, there’s a huge amount of music on offer --
remastered CDs and newly released songs.  “Power to the People: the Hits” comes as a single-disc
introduction or a deluxe edition with a DVD of all its songs.
The compilation is similar to “Lennon Legend” from 1997, with
five fewer tracks. Just about all Lennon collections have “Give
Peace a Chance,” “Instant Karma!” and (if you must) “Happy
Xmas (War is Over).” Rating: ***.  Those wanting more can opt for “Gimme Some Truth,” a new
box with four themed CDs: Working Class Hero (politics), Woman
(love songs), Roots (rock ‘n’ roll) and Borrowed Time (personal
tracks). Rating: **. Still, the 1991 four-CD set “Lennon” did
it better with its simple chronological approach. Rating: ****.  Lennon’s best work was with the Beatles, and the band’s
albums were reissued in an improved form last year. Fans already
will have marked Oct. 19 for the re-release of the two
compilations “1962-1966” and “1967-1970.” Rating: ****.  His solo discs are available separately or as part of a
“Signature” 11-CD box set. Wisely, the reissues don’t include
the experimental “Unfinished Music” LPs, “The Wedding Album”
or the raw “Live Peace in Toronto” with  Yoko Ono  in 1968-69.  Tender Ballads  Instead, we start with “John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band.”
The 1970 release is known for its expletive-laden lyrics and
declaration “the dream is over.” The true gems are tender
ballads such as “Love” and “Look at Me.” Rating: ****.  If the joys of the song “Imagine” have soured through
repetition, the rest of the 1971 record of the same name shows
Lennon emerging from his personal hell, mocking  Paul McCartney 
(“How Do You Sleep”), loving his wife (“Oh Yoko!”) and
maturing in reflective numbers such as “Jealous Guy.” Rating:
****.  The double LP “Some Time in New York City” from 1972
remains a sloppy ragbag of frazzled jams and slogans from every
trendy left-wing bandwagon that Lennon jumped on. Only “Woman
Is the Nigger of the World” endures. Rating: *.  After this abrasive effort, “Mind Games” was unashamedly
commercial. It was recorded in 1973 at the start of Lennon’s
split from Ono, yet betrays little of this turmoil on numbers
such as “Out the Blue.” Rating: ***.  Lost Weekend  “Walls and Bridges,” from 1974, is a fine effort given
that it was done during Lennon’s 18-month boozy “lost
weekend.” There’s the  Elton John  duet “Whatever Gets You Thru
the Night,” “#9 Dream” and the heartfelt “Nobody Loves You
(When You’re Down and Out).” Rating: ***½.  “Rock ‘n’ Roll” from 1975 was a patchy return to Lennon’s
first love, rock, and contains his excellent cover of Ben E.
King’s “Stand by Me.” Rating: **½.  After a reconciliation with Ono, the birth of their son
Sean and five years as a house-husband, the comeback “Double
Fantasy” from 1980 alternates between Lennon and Ono
compositions. The best, “(Just Like) Starting Over” and
“Watching the Wheels,” outweigh sugary pap such as “Beautiful
Boy (Darling Boy).” There’s now a “Stripped Down” version of
the LP, shorn of many sound effects and with an affecting
simplicity. Rating: ***.  Lennon wrote “Grow Old With Me,” inspired by  Robert Browning , for Ono. He aimed it as a standard for weddings. It
gained significance with his murder and can be found on the
posthumous “Milk and Honey,” finished by Ono in 1984. Rating:
**.  Home Recordings  The “Signature” box adds two CDs of singles, home
recordings and studio outtakes such as a coruscating version of
“God.” Still, there are tracks missing: Lennon devotees still
will need “Live in New York City,” the 1988 four-CD set
“Anthology,” other reissues with bonus tracks and “Menlove
Ave.” from 1986. It’s a shame that these rarities aren’t
included as extras on the respective records.  For all this, the box is beautifully presented, with essays
by Ono, Sean and  Julian Lennon . The discs were last remastered
about six years ago, and both are a vast improvement on the flat
sound of the first rushed CD versions. The Janovian primal
screams on “Mother” are crystal clear and all the scarier for
that. Rating: ***½.  “Power to the People: the Hits” is $9.99 or $20.99 for
the deluxe version. The individual remastered albums are $11.99,
“Gimme Some Truth” is $30.99 and the “John Lennon Signature
Box’ is $151.99. All are on EMI Records. Download prices vary
across services.  ( Mark Beech  writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
