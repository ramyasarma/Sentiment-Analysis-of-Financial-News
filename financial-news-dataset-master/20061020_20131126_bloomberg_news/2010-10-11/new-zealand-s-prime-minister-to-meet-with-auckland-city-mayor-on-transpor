New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key 
will meet with Auckland’s new mayor to discuss the government’s
funding of roads and rail in the nation’s largest city following
the weekend’s election result.  Mayor Len Brown pledged during his campaign that transport
was the number one priority for the city, arguing for an inner-
city rail loop and a rail connection to the airport. The
government has already put as much as NZ$1.5 billion ($1.1
billion) into electrification, buying new rolling stock and
double tracking lines in Auckland, Key said today.  “Part of this conversation will be how much will the
ratepayers of Auckland be willing to pay because not all of the
responsibility can fall back on central government,” Key told
 Television New Zealand .  The election was one of the final steps in the merger of
eight separate city and district councils into the largest city
in New Zealand and Australia under the control of a single
council, with a population of 1.4 million.  Key’s government is betting the single city will reduce
costs for businesses, improve how roads and facilities function
and foster economic growth. Ports of Auckland Ltd. is the
nation’s biggest port;  Auckland International Airport Ltd. 
handles 70 percent of the nation’s visitor arrivals.  Brown, who was mayor of Manukau City in south Auckland, was
declared the winner of the mayoral vote soon after voting in the
postal poll closed on Oct. 9. His 221,300 votes beat Auckland
City Mayor  John Banks  by more than 60,000.  To contact the reporter for this story:
