Gold futures rose to a record
closing price on bets that the dollar will resume a slump,
boosting demand for precious metals as an alternative
investment. Silver extended a rally to the highest level since
1980.  The  greenback  traded close to a a 15-year low against the
yen on speculation that the Federal Reserve will expand a
stimulus program to bolster the economy. The dollar rebounded
against the euro. Hedge funds and other large speculators hold
the most-bullish position in gold futures in almost a year. The
metal has climbed 24 percent this year.  “The bullish case for gold is still intact, and people
will come in and buy on the dips,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “You’ve got the specter of
more Fed easing and economic uncertainty to support the gold
market.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $9.10, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,354.40 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the

percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and bought
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to revive the economy.
Policy makers next meet on Nov. 3 to decide on another round of
quantitative easing.  Macquarie Bank Ltd. forecast that gold and silver next year
will trade 15 percent higher than forecast. Gold will average
$1,265, and silver will climb to $19.50 an ounce, the bank said
in a report.  Exchange-Traded Products  Demand for gold as a haven from slumping currencies boosted
investment in exchange-traded products backed by the metal.
 Global holdings  gained about 1.1 metric tons to 2,084.76 tons on
Oct. 8, according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers after
reaching a record 2,097.01 tons on Sept. 30.  The 14-day relative-strength index for gold futures has
been above 70 since Sept. 22, a signal to some traders that
prices are poised to fall.  “Gold is overbought and needs a correction before it can go
higher,” Lesh of FuturePath said.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 24.4 cents,
