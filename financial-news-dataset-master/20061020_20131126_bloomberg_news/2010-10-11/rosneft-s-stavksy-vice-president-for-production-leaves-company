OAO Rosneft , Russia’s biggest oil
producer, said  Mikhail Stavsky , vice president in charge of oil
and gas production, left the company as of today after his
contract ended and he took a new job.  Stavsky had worked at the company for almost five years,
Moscow-based Rosneft said on its website, without saying who
will replace him.  Rosneft’s board appointed  Eduard Khudainatov  as chief
executive officer on Sept. 6, ending Sergei Bogdanchikov’s
almost 12-year run as head of the company.  Rosneft spokesman Nikolai Manvelov said today by e-mail
that he was also leaving the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
