South Korea’s won climbed to a five-
month high as a worsening U.S. labor market spurred speculation
the Federal Reserve will step up asset purchases, accelerating
the flow of funds into higher-yielding assets.  The Kospi share index rose to its highest level since 2007
as foreigners bought $13.2 billion more shares than they sold so
far this year. Americans lost more jobs than forecast in
September, with payrolls falling by 95,000 workers from a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed last week.  “The theme of the market is stronger Asian currencies as
we see abundant liquidity and a weaker dollar because of
quantitative easing,” said  Yun Se Min , a Seoul-based trader at
Busan Bank. “If we don’t see intervention from the authorities,
we can reach 1,000 per dollar this week.”  The won rose 0.7 percent to 1,112.80 per dollar as of 9:37
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
reached 1,110.75, the strongest level since May 3. The currency
climbed 4.6 percent in the past month, Asia’s best performance.  South Korea’s producer prices rose at the fastest pace in
three months in September, up 4 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a gain of 3.1 percent in August, the central bank
said last week. “Traders are betting on a rate hike and that’s
also helping demand for the currency,” Yun said.  The central bank will raise the seven-day repurchase rate
to 2.5 percent this week, according to four out of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest expect it to be
unchanged at 2.25 percent.  South Korean government bonds were little changed. The
yield on the 3.75 percent debt due June 2013 was 3.26 percent,
the lowest level since the notes were issued in June, according
to Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
