Soybeans, used for animal feed and
cooking oil, rose to a 16-month high on signs that supplies will
fall in the U.S. and Brazil, the world’s largest producers.  The U.S. crop will be 2.2 percent smaller than forecast in
September, the Department of Agriculture said on Oct. 8. Dry
weather in central Brazil during the next five days will delay
planting, according to  T-Storm Weather LLC  in Chicago. Prices
surged 7.4 percent last week, the biggest such gain in a year.  “The market is adjusting to a smaller U.S. crop,” said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago. “Dry weather continues to threaten
timely planting in parts of South America.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 42.25 cents, or
3.7 percent, to $11.7725 a bushel at 10:18 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, prices touched $11.8875, the highest
level since June 2009.  On Oct. 8, the price surged 70 cents, or the maximum
allowed by the exchange.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
