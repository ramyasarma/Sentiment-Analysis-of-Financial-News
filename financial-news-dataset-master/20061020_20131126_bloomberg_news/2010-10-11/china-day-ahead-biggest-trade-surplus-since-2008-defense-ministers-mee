China may tomorrow report a $17.8
billion  trade surplus  for September that would cap the biggest
quarterly excess since the financial crisis in 2008, adding fuel
to U.S. calls for import protection.  The median estimate of 24 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
News compares with an August surplus of $20 billion. That would
take the third-quarter total to $66.5 billion, the largest since
the fourth quarter of 2008.  Defense Issues  Differences over the best way to resolve flare-ups in
disputed waters off China’s coast will be tested today at a
meeting of defense ministers from 18 Asia-Pacific countries in
Hanoi.  Defense Secretary  Robert Gates , who described the U.S. as
an “enthusiastic participant” in the meeting, said yesterday
territorial disputes should be solved through regional talks.
China, which last month had run-ins with vessels from Vietnam
and Japan in waters more than 1,000 miles apart, prefers one-on-
one negotiations.  Gates also accepted an invitation to visit China early next
year as the world’s biggest militaries sought to mend ties
strained by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and support for other
Asian allies.  Currency Influence  Billionaire investor  George Soros  said China’s use of
capital controls gives the country a “tremendous” competitive
advantage, allowing it to exert influence over other currencies
as well as its own.  China is “the dominant factor in deciding how the
currencies of other countries move,” Soros said in a television
interview on CNBC. “Not only do they control their own currency,
but actually they can greatly influence the exchange rate of
other countries.”  Deutsche Yuan-Linked Notes  Deutsche Bank AG  sold $70 million of one-year notes linked
to Chinese government debt.  The notes pay a coupon of 125 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered  rate , or Libor, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities were issued at a
price of 100 percent of face value.  China Argentina Soy  China will allow the two largest state-owned grains and
oilseeds trading companies to import soybean oil from Argentina,
easing restrictions imposed in April, said two traders with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Beijing-based Cofco Ltd., China’s biggest grain trader, and
 China Grain Reserves Corp.  have been cleared by the commerce
ministry to import soybean oil from Argentina, said the traders,
who declined to be identified as they are not permitted to speak
to the media.  GM, Mercedes Sales  General Motors Co. , the biggest overseas automaker in China,
said sales increased 15 percent in the country in September on
strong demand for Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac products.  GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 208,353 units last
month, it said in an e-mailed statement. Sales from Shanghai
General Motors Corp, the joint-venture with SAIC Motor Co.,
totaled 100,786 vehicles, it said.  Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz said unit sales in mainland
China rose 114 percent in September to more than 13,940 units,
according to an e-mailed statement.  Norway Meeting Canceled  Chinese authorities canceled a meeting with Norway’s
Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Minister  Lisbeth Berg-Hansen , who
is in Shanghai to promote the Nordic country’s seafood export to
the world’s most populous country.  “The meeting has been canceled,” said Magnus Hodne, a
spokesman at the  Norwegian ministry , declining to give a reason.
The ministers’ second meeting later this week is still scheduled
to take place, he said. The Chinese Embassy in Oslo was not
immediately available for a comment.  China Copper Demand  Copper demand is set to grow from China and other emerging
markets, while supply limits will intensify, according to Daniel
Brebner, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.  “China’s consumption intensity growth may be reaching its
peak, but requirements could double over the next decade,”
 Brebner  said in a presentation at a London Metal Exchange
conference in London.  MARKETS:  Most U.S. stocks climbed, as trading volume sank to the
