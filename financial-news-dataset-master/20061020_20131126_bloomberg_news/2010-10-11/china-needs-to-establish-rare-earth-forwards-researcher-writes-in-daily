China should set up a forward market
for rare-earth elements to help boost prices, Guo Chaoxian, a
researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in a commentary in the
China Daily today.  The government should also set up a mechanism to purchase
and store rare-earth commodities to “strike a balance between
demand and supply,” Guo wrote in the newspaper.  The Chinese government should encourage mergers of rare-
earth companies with the goal of setting up an oligarchy of
three to five “giant enterprises,” Guo said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
