PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc, a consumer
products maker, had its recommendation increased to “buy” from
“under review” at Renaissance Capital, which cited recent
capacity expansions that will help it maintain its position as
market leader in detergents.  The Ikeja-based company’s price estimate was raised to 42
naira per share from 33 naira, analysts including Mbithe Muema
wrote in a note to clients dated today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
