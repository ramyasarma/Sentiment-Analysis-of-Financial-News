Japan’s 10-year  bond  futures rose
for a second day on speculation the yen’s strength will
accelerate a decline in domestic prices and prompt the central
bank to ease monetary policy further.  The benchmark 10-year yield traded near a seven-year low
after Kyodo News said on Oct. 10 the Bank of Japan will reduce
its estimate for consumer prices. The BOJ may quadruple its
asset-purchase program to 20 trillion yen ($244 billion) to cope
with a deteriorating economy and a stronger yen, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said today.  “The yen will remain strong and concern that the economy
is worsening is persistent, so investors continue to expect
further easing by the central bank,” said  Takeshi Minami , chief
economist in Tokyo at Norinchukin Research Institute Co. “Money
is more likely to flow into the bond market.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery advanced 0.11
to 144.06 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Japan’s markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond dipped half a basis
point to 0.85 percent as of 3:22 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
0.8 percent security due September 2020 rose 0.046 yen to 99.542.  The yield sank to 0.82 percent on Oct. 6, a level not seen
since July 1, 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Bank of Japan will forecast that the nation’s consumer
price index excluding fresh food may fall or remain unchanged in
fiscal 2011, Kyodo said. That compares with a 0.1 percent
increase the BOJ estimated in July, Kyodo said.  BOJ Purchases  Consumer prices  excluding fresh food dropped for an 18th
month in August, a government report showed on Oct. 1. Deflation,
a general drop in prices, enhances the purchasing power of the
fixed payments from debt.  A gauge for Japanese household sentiment slid for a third
month in September, the Cabinet Office said today.  “Demand for consumer goods and services remains weak,”
Norinchukin’s Minami said. “We can’t expect wages to rise and
boost demand.”  The BOJ on Oct. 5 cut its key interest rate to a range of
zero to 0.1 percent and announced the creation of a 5 trillion
yen fund to buy government and corporate debt, exchange-traded
funds and real-estate investment trusts.  “We envisage the new asset-buying fund being expanded
three times, by 5 trillion each time, resulting in 20 trillion
yen in asset purchases by the end of 2011,”  Chiwoong Lee ,
senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, wrote in a report
dated today.  Stock Slump  The yen appreciated to 81.39 per dollar yesterday, the
strongest since April 1995. Japan sold the yen to weaken it on
Sept. 15 for the first time since 2004 after the currency
reached 82.88 versus the greenback.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid- 2.1 percent today, the
most since Sept. 8. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas
sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. plans to boost its yen-
denominated bond holdings and reduce investment in Japanese
stocks in the second half of the fiscal year, Akifumi Kai, a
manager in the investment planning division, said in an
interview today. The company plans to mainly invest in Japanese
government bonds with terms of 20 years and longer, he said.  Dai-ichi Life is Japan’s second-largest life insurer with
about 30 trillion yen in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
