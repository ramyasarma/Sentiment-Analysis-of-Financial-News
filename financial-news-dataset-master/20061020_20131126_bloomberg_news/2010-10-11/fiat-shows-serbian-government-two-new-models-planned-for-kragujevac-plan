Fiat SpA  showed Serbian government
officials two models that will be built at the carmaker’s plant
in the Balkan country and exported to the European Union and the
U.S., the Economy Ministry said.  A five-seat model designed for the EU and a seven-seat
vehicle to be sold there and in the U.S. would be built at
Fiat’s factory in Kragujevac by about the second quarter of
2012,  Mladjan Dinkic , Serbia’s deputy prime minister in charge
of economy, said in a statement sent by e-mail yesterday after
the officials visited Fiat headquarters in Turin, Italy.  The project will add 1,433 jobs to an existing workforce of
1,000 at the plant, and capacity will total 200,000 cars a year,
with expansion to 300,000 vehicles possible, the ministry said.
Exports of the models in 2012 would total about 500 million
euros ($697 million) and rise to 1.3 billion euros in 2013, it
said. That would be equivalent to about 20 percent of Serbia’s
sales abroad in 2009, the ministry said.  Fiat, Italy’s biggest carmaker, set up a joint venture with
Serbia’s government two years ago, taking a 67 percent stake in
a partnership that absorbed state-owned carmaker Zastava. Plans
for the new models are being revived after being frozen in 2009
because of the global recession. The plant at Kragujevac makes
about 20,000 of  Fiat ’s Punto compact a year, for sale in Serbia
and abroad.  Test production of the models is scheduled to begin next
year, the ministry said, reiterating a statement from July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
