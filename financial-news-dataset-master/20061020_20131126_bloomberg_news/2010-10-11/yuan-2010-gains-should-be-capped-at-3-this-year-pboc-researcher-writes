The yuan should not be allowed to
appreciate more than 3 percent this year and the government
should intervene if gains reach that point, a central bank
researcher wrote in a commentary published in today’s Securities
Times newspaper.  The value of the yuan has been continuing to rise since
June when China restarted its currency reform, with China’s
currency expected to appreciate 5 percent this year if the
current pace is maintained,  Wang Yong , a professor with the
People’s Bank of China’s training school in Zhengzhou, Henan
province, wrote in the newspaper.  The Chinese government should set the 3 percent ceiling as
a “red line” that can warrant “moderate” government
intervention in the currency market in a timely manner, Wang
wrote.  -- Zheng Lifei . Editor: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
