Brazil’s real rose for a second day
as commodity prices increased to a two-year high.  The real advanced 0.2 percent to 1.6634 per dollar at 9:06
a.m. New York time, from 1.6661 on Oct. 8.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 1.3 percent to 571.4810, the highest level since Oct.
3, 2008.  “During the last two weeks many commodities, goods and
materials prices are increasing,” said  Silvio Campos Neto ,
chief economist at Banco Schahin SA, in a telephone interview
from Sao Paulo. “The real is gaining in this scenario of
commodity prices increasing.”  Raw sugar rose 1.2 percent to 26.64 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price earlier touched 27.24 cents
a pound, the highest in almost eight months, on speculation that
crops in Brazil, the world’s largest supplier of the sweetener,
will be harmed by drought that lasted through mid September.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
11.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
