Enel SpA  will “firmly” control
Green Power after the alternative energy unit’s initial public
offering later this month, Chairman  Piero Gnudi  said in an
interview with  Il Giornale .  Floating about 30 percent of the unit “allows us to firmly
keep the majority and the operational management of the
company,” Il Giornale quoted Gnudi as saying. Gnudi indicated
that he might accept another mandate as Enel’s chairman when his
third term expires next year, saying “this decision will be up
to the shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
