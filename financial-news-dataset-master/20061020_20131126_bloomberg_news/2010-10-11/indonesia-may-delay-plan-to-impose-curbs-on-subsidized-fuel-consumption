Indonesia may delay a plan to limit
the use of subsidized fuel to early next year from this month,
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs  Hatta Rajasa  said.  “We want to be all ready before we implement the policy,”
Rajasa told reporters in Jakarta today. “Hopefully in January,
it can be implemented nationwide.”  The curb on subsidized fuel consumption may help Indonesia,
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, cut subsidy spending in the
state budget by 8 percent to 184.8 trillion rupiah ($21 billion)
next year, according to Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  in August. The government planned to limit the fuel
use for private cars with engine capacities of more than 2,000
cubic centimeters this year, Energy Minister  Darwin Saleh  said
June 25.  Consumption of subsidized fuel in Indonesia may rise by 6
percent to 42.5 million kiloliters next year as economic
expansion boosts vehicle sales, PT Pertamina Marketing Director
Djaelani Sutomo said June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
