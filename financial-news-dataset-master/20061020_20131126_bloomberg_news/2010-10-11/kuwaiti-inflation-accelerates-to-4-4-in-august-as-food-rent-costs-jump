Kuwaiti inflation accelerated in
August to its fastest pace in more than a year as the costs of
food and housing increased.  The inflation rate rose to 4.4 percent from 4 percent in
the previous month, the highest since May 2009, according to
data posted on the Central Statistical Office  website  today.  Food prices increased 10.8 percent compared with 8.5
percent in July while housing increased 4.7 percent, the same as
in the previous month.  Inflation in Kuwait, the only Gulf Arab state to have
dropped its currency peg to the U.S. dollar, slowed to a three-
year low of an average of 4 percent last year from 10.6 percent
in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
