China may extend its post-holiday
rally as economic fundamentals remain solid and valuations
aren’t demanding, according to China International Capital Corp.  The Shanghai Composite Index has climbed 6.3 percent in the
two days since trading resumed after the National Day holiday,
headed for the biggest two-day gain since Aug. 21, 2009. China’s
stock markets were closed from Oct. 1 until Oct. 7.  “The rally probably has legs,” Hao Hong, Beijing-based
global equity strategist at CICC, said in an e-mail. “Despite
such a strong performance, our technical overbought/oversold
index is still about neutral, suggesting some further gains
ahead from a technical perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
