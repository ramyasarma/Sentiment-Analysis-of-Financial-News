Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
government opposes any move to grant Greece more time to repay
its loans, the German Finance Ministry said.  “We are not in favor of extending the repayments
schedule” for Greece, German Finance Ministry spokesman
Bertrand Benoit said by phone today. Any such move would be
“premature,” he said.  “Greece must establish a track record of implementing the
program, which they are doing so far,” he said. “The deficit-
cutting program ‘‘is designed in such a way that if implemented
fully, there shouldn’t be any need for extension of the
repayment schedule.’’ From 2012, when the program expires,
Greece should be able to refinance itself on the market, he
said.  In addition, ‘‘it’s important there can be absolutely no
doubt about the quality of the statistics’’ used by Greece,
Benoit said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
