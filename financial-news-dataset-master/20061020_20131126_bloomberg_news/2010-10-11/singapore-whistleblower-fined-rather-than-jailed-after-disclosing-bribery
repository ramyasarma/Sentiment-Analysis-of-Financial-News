Ang Seng Thor , the former head of
AEM-Evertech Holdings Ltd., was fined rather than jailed for
corruption by a Singapore judge after disclosing bribes to
companies including  Seagate Technology Plc .  His whistle-blowing led to the full discovery of
wrongdoings that were difficult to find and prosecute, Singapore
District Judge John Ng said in his ruling today. Ang, who
pleaded guilty, “played a passive role” in the bribery, Ng
said.  Ang told the board of Singapore-based AEM in 2005 that its
executives including himself and former Chairman Tok Kian You
bribed employees at Seagate and  Infineon Technologies AG ,
according to court papers. The former CEO also informed the
board of  STMicroelectronics NV  that bribes were given to its
executives.  Ang was fined a total of S$200,000 ($153,000) for two
corruption charges and barred five years from being a company
director, Ng said. He could have been jailed for as long as five
years for each charge.  Wendell Wong, Ang’s lawyer, had asked for a fine instead of
a jail term, saying the prospect of imprisonment would deter
whistleblowers.  Singapore’s courts must accord a significant recognition to
whistleblowers, who deserve a discount on their sentence, Ng
said. “At the same time, we need not elevate whistle-blowing to
an exalted level,” he said.  AEM-Evertech was renamed  AEM Holdings Ltd.  in May 2007.  The case is Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor DACs 20430-
5/2010 in the Singapore Subordinate Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
