Sugar futures rose to the highest
price in almost eight months in New York on concern that adverse
weather will limit supplies from Brazil, the world’s largest
producer. Cocoa prices advanced and coffee fell.  Brazil’s sugar-cane harvest will be 3.2 percent smaller
than previously estimated, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
attache in Sao Paulo said last week. A four-month drought
damaged crops in the country’s biggest producing region, the
South Central area. Before today, the sweetener jumped 17
percent in 12 months.  “There is a little more demand than supply on sugar,”
said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa,
Florida. There is a “bullish sentiment” in the market, he
said.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.55 cent, or 2.1
percent, to 26.87 cents a pound at 10:37 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, after reaching 27.24 cents, the highest level
since Feb. 12.  Raw sugar may test 60 cents a pound in the next year,
Tintle said.  In London, refined sugar futures for December delivery
gained $7.80, or 1.2 percent, to $685.40 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. Earlier, the most-active contract touched $696.90, the
highest price since Feb. 22.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $48, or 1.7
percent, to $2,851 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures
for December delivery gained 26 pounds, or 1.4 percent, to 1,896
pounds ($3,018) a ton.  Arabica coffee futures for December delivery declined 3.95
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $1.782 a pound in New York. Robusta
coffee futures for January delivery fell $22, or 1.3 percent to
$1,633 a ton in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
