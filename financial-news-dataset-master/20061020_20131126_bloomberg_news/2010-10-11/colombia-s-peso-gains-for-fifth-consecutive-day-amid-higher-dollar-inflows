Colombia’s peso rose for a fifth day
on bets the central bank’s daily dollar purchases won’t be
enough to ease gains in the currency amid increased foreign
investment flows.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,785.25 per dollar at
3:40 p.m. New York time, from 1,786.80 on Oct. 8. It’s up 14.5
percent this year, the best performance among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Banco de la Republica foresees increased capital flows into
the economy through early 2011, according to  minutes  of the
Sept. 24 monetary policy meeting released at the end of last
week. In a bid to ease the peso’s rally, policy makers said
Sept. 15 the central bank will buy a minimum of $20 million
daily for at least four months to bolster foreign reserves. The
currency has gained 1.2 percent since the announcement.  The peso’s strengthening “trend continues, but volatility
has disappeared amid the central bank’s intervention,” said
 Daniel Velandia , head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval
SA.  A group of Colombian business associations including ANDI,
the country’s biggest, asked the government and central bank to
take further measures to ease the peso’s world-beating rally
which “has reached a point where it jeopardizes the Colombian
economy’s positive outlook,” according to a copy of the letter
sent by e-mail today.  Among the measures, the business groups ask that officials
impose capital controls and increase dollar purchases in the
currency market.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due
2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.99
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. On Oct. 8, it
fell to 6.98 percent, its lowest level since the fixed-rate
bonds were issued in July 2005. The bond’s price fell 0.075
centavo to 127.717 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
