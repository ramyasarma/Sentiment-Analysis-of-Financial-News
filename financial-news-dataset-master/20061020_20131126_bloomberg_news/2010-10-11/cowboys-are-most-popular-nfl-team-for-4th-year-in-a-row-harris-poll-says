The Dallas Cowboys, 1-3 on the
season and last in their division, are the most-popular National
Football League team with U.S. sports fans for the fourth
straight year, according to the Harris Poll.  The Indianapolis Colts rose to second from fourth in the
poll of 2,620 adults surveyed on-line between Sept. 14 and 20 by
Harris Interactive. The Green Bay Packers climbed to third from
sixth and the Pittsburgh Steelers fell two places to fourth.  Winning the Super Bowl helped the New Orleans Saints jump
19 places to fifth from 24th in the poll’s biggest gain, the
company said in a news release. The Seattle Seahawks had the
biggest decline in popularity, falling 17 places to second-to-
last, ahead of Jacksonville among the 32 teams. The Jaguars are
last for the second straight year.  The New York Giants are seventh, up one place from last
year, while the New York Jets are 16th, up four spots from 2009.  One in five Americans picked the Saints to win the Super
Bowl, the release said. One in 10 believes the Colts or New
England Patriots will win the title.  The number of Americans calling themselves football fans
rose to 53 percent from 51 percent last year, the highest number
since 1999, the news release said. About 66 percent of men and
41 percent of women said they followed the sport.  The Harris Poll doesn’t list a margin of error.  The Cowboys lost 34-27 to the Tennessee Titans at home
yesterday to fall into last place in the National Football
Conference East. Dallas won Super Bowls after the 1992, 1993 and
1995 seasons, and has just two postseason wins since.  To contact the reporter on this story:
