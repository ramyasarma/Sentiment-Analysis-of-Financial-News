Workers at the  Diamond Trading Co.
of Botswana , a joint venture between De Beers and the southern
African nation’s government, today started an indefinite strike
over pay.  Talks over wages failed last night and about 95 percent of
DTC’s workers are now striking, company spokesman Kago Mmopi
said by phone today from the capital, Gaborone. “Mitigation
plans are in place to cushion instability and impact on
output,” the company said in an e-mailed statement, without
providing further detail.  Management is offering a 6 percent increase while workers
are demanding 8 percent plus improved allowances, Kabelo
Kelepile, chairman of the Diamond Trading Co. of Botswana
Workers Union, said in an interview in the city today.  Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond producer, may produce
24 million carats of gems this year, 36 percent more than in
2009, as demand recovers from a global economic recession,
Kgomotso Abi, director of mining at Botswana’s Department of
Mines, said on July 27.  The diamonds are produced by Debswana Diamond Co., a joint
venture between the government and De Beers, and are sorted and
valued by DTC Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
