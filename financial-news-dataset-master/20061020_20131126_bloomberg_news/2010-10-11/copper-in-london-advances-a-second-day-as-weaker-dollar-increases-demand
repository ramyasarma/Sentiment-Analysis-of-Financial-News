Copper climbed for a second day on
speculation the Federal Reserve will increase measures to
stimulate the economy, weighing on the dollar and boosting
demand for commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.3 percent to $8,330.50 a metric ton,
before trading at $8,330 a ton by 8:04 a.m. Singapore time. The
metal advanced to $8,349.50 a ton on Oct. 8, the highest price
since July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
