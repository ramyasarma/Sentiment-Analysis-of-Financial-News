Atlanta Thrashers goaltender  Ondrej Pavelec  was released from the hospital two days after he
collapsed during a game, the National Hockey League team said on
 its website .  Pavelec fainted at 2:25 into the first period of the
Thrasher’s 4-2 home victory over the Washington Capitals on Oct.
8. The 23-year-old Czech fell while play was at the other end of
the rink and suffered a concussion when his head hit the ice.
Pavelec lay motionless on his back for about 15 minutes before
being transported to a local hospital, where he was awake, alert
and asking about the score of the game, the  team said .  “I want to thank all the doctors, trainers and emergency
personnel who took such good care of me,” Pavelec said on the
Thrashers’ website. “I would also like to thank my teammates,
all the fans and everyone in the hockey community who have
reached out to me and offered their support and well-wishes over
the last few days.”  Pavelec was released from the hospital yesterday and is
undergoing precautionary heart, blood and genetic tests, the
team said. He will be medically cleared to return pending the
results of these tests and the resolution of any lingering
effects of his concussion.  Chris Mason  will start in goal in Pavelec’s absence. The
Thrashers are 1-1-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
