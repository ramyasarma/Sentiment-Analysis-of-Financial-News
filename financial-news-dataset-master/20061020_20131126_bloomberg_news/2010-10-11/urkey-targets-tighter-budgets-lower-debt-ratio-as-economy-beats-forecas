Turkey’s government announced plans
to tighten  budget deficit  targets for the three years through
2012, as domestic demand drives one of the fastest expansions
among major economies.  The government will aim for a 2011 budget deficit of 33.5
billion liras ($23.7 billion), or 2.8 percent of gross domestic
product, Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  told reporters in
Ankara today, announcing a revised three-year economic plan. The
previous version had predicted a gap of 45.1 billion liras, or 4
percent of GDP.  Babacan said growth had exceeded expectations in the first
half of the year, allowing the government to borrow less than
forecast and reduce the size of the debt stock relative to
output faster than expected, as well as cutting the budget
deficit. The  economy  grew about 11 percent annually in the first
half of 2010, rivaling China for the fastest expansion in the
Group of 20 economies.  “That’s not a pace that can be sustained indefinitely,”
Babacan said, predicting that 6.8 percent growth this year will
slow to 4.5 percent in 2011. He said those forecasts were
“cautious” because “if there’s going to be a surprise we want
it to be a good one.”  Babacan also reduced the forecast deficit this year to 44.2
billion liras, from the 50 billion predicted in last year’s
economic plan. The reduction shows that “there’s been no
electoral spending,” even as the government campaigned for
constitutional changes in a referendum last month and prepares
for elections expected in June next year, he said.  Bonds Rise  Turkish bonds gained after the economic plan was announced.
Yields on benchmark two-year lira debt fell 14 basis points to
7.70 percent at 3:22 p.m. in Istanbul, according to an  ABN Amro
Holding NV index , headed for the lowest close since the index
started in October 2004.  Turkey’s debt stock will decline to 42.3 percent of GDP
this year, 40.6 percent in 2011 and 38.8 percent in 2012, the
new document says. The previous plan forecast 49 percent at the
end of this year.  “One of the key factors making Turkey’s debt outlook
promising is that it will be declining - a rare forecast
globally these days,”  Tevfik Aksoy , Morgan Stanley’s London-
based chief economist for Turkey, the Middle East and north
Africa, said in an e-mailed comment today.  Still, the government plans to spend more. Spending in 2011
will be 312.5 billion liras, up from a previous estimate of
298.2 billion liras, according to the program. Revenue is
forecast at 279 billion liras.  To contact the reporters on this story:
