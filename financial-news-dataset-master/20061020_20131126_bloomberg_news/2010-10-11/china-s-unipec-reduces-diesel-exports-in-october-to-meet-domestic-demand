China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Corp., the nation’s largest oil trader, plans to
reduce  diesel exports  for a second month in October because of
increased domestic demand, a company official said.  Unipec, as China International is known, plans to export
90,000 metric tons of diesel, or three cargoes, this month
compared with 120,000 tons in September, said a company official
with knowledge of the sales.  The company will continue to halt diesel imports this month,
he said.  China’s diesel needs typically increase in September and
October as farmers harvest their crops before winter arrives.
Unipec has halved diesel exports in September from August.  Unipec is the trading unit of  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. , the country’s biggest oil refiner.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  Ryan Woo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
