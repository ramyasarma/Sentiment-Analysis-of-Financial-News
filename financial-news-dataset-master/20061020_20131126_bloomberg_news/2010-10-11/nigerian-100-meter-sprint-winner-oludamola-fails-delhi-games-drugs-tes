Osayemi Oludamola of Nigeria, the
women’s 100-meter sprint champion at the  Commonwealth Games  in
New Delhi, failed a drugs test, the multisport event’s governing
body said.  Commonwealth Games Federation President Michael Fennell
said at a press briefing today that Oludamola had been notified
of the positive test and has requested the testing of her
secondary sample.  Organizers had received 750 results from 950 tests for
banned substances, Fennell said. “Unfortunately, I have to
report that we have had a positive test. The result was in
relation to the winner of the womens’ 100 meters,” he said.
Oludamola’s provisional suspension meant no decision had yet
been taken on final medals for the event, he said.  Oludamola finished second in the women’s 100-meter sprint
final on Oct. 7, though was awarded the gold medal when
Australia’s Sally Pearson was belatedly disqualified for a false
start.  To contact the reporters on this story:
