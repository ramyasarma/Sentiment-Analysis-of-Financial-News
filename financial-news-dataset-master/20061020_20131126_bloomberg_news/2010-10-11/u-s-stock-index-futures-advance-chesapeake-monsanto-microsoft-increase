Most U.S. stocks climbed, as trading
volume sank to the lowest level of the year, amid growing
speculation that the Federal Reserve will pump more cash into
the economy to protect the recovery.  Boeing Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and International Business
Machines Corp. rose more than 0.5 percent, leading gains in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Gymboree Corp.  surged 22 percent
after Bain Capital LLC agreed to buy the children’s clothing
retailer agreed for about $1.8 billion. Tyson Foods Inc. fell
for a second day amid concern its feed costs will rise.  In the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, 268 companies rose and
224 fell at 4 p.m. New York time. The measure increased less
than 0.1 percent to 1,165.32. The  Dow  advanced 3.86 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 11,010.34. Trading  volume  on U.S.
exchanges amounted to 5.62 billion shares.  “The Federal Reserve has made it very clear that they are
intent on supporting the markets and that has set a floor,”
said  Oliver Pursche , co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund
and president of Suffern, New York-based Gary Goldberg Financial
Services, which manages $500 million.  U.S. stocks rallied last week, sending the Dow average
above 11,000 for the first time since before the May 6 crash,
after a report showed the economy created fewer-than-estimated
private jobs in September, bolstering speculation the Fed will
buy more debt to boost the economy. The S&P 500 rose 8.8 percent
last month, its best September since 1939, as the central bank
said it’s willing to ease monetary policy further.  Fed Prediction  Job losses will lead the Fed to increase Treasury purchases
at its meeting next month, UBS AG said. The Federal Open Market
Committee will announce plans to buy $35 billion to $65 billion
of debt a month at the Nov. 2-3 session,  Mansoor Mohi-uddin ,
head of global currency strategy in Singapore, wrote to clients
today. The Fed will buy that amount over one quarter and then
review the policy, he predicted.  Boeing rose 1.1 percent to $69.99. JPMorgan climbed 1.1
percent to $39.73. IBM advanced 0.6 percent to $139.66. DuPont
Co. fell the most in the Dow, losing 1.2 percent to $46.09. 3M
Co. slumped 1 percent to $88.25.  Gymboree  surged 22 percent to $64.83. Bain, a buyout firm,
is gaining a business whose free cash flow tripled since 2008.  Tyson Foods slumped 1.1 percent to $14.84, adding to its
7.7 percent retreat on Oct. 8. Corn futures jumped to a two-year
high today and the price of the main feed ingredient is more
than 70 percent above the 10-year average.  Higher Yields  Telephone companies in the S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent, the
most among 10 industries. The search for higher yields is
driving the biggest rally in seven years for phone stocks, as
investors ignore some of the lowest profit forecasts in the MSCI
World Index.  Verizon Communications Inc.  and PCCW Ltd. are leading a 21
percent gain in MSCI’s gauge of 52 telecommunications companies
since the end of the second quarter even as analysts estimate
the group’s earnings will grow at less than half the pace of the
MSCI World measure of stocks in 24 developed nations, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. U.S. phone shares are the most
expensive industry in the S&P 500 relative to forecast profits.  Verizon gained 0.6 percent to $33.03 today, and  AT&T Inc. 
climbed 0.4 percent to $28.32.  To contact the reporters on this story:
