Makhteshim Agan Industries Ltd.
surged the most on record after Koor Industries Ltd. said it
reached an “initial understanding” with China National Chemical
Corp. to take the company private.  Makhteshim soared 26 percent, the biggest gain since at
least May 1998 when Bloomberg began tracking the shares, to
16.91 shekels at 12:01 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  The deal would value Makhteshim at $2.72 billion, according
to a statement filed with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
