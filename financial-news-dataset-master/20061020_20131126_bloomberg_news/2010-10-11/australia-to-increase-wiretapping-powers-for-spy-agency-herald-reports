Australia will boost wiretapping
powers and increase intelligence sharing between the nation’s
law-enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and other threats to
national security, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.  Changes to laws will allow state police forces and other
crime agencies to use the Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation’s wiretapping technology, the newspaper reported.
The amendments to the Telecommunications Interception and Access
Act introduced to parliament will also allow ASIO to share more
information with the Defence Signals Directorate, the Australian
Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Imagery and
Geospatial Organisation, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
