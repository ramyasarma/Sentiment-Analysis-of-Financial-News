U.S. stocks fell, erasing earlier
gains, with industrial and financial shares leading declines as
investors awaited more earnings reports and speculated about the
Federal Reserve’s intentions to spur economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,163.49 at 3:38 p.m. in New York after climbing 0.3 percent
earlier today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 14.35
points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,992.13.  Earlier gains in stocks came amid growing speculation the
Fed will pump more cash into the economy to safeguard the
recovery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
