Zimbabwe will hold a nationwide
referendum on June 30 on a constitution,  Zimonline  reported,
citing the nation’s constitution select committee.  Discussions will be held from Nov. 1 to Dec. 22, and the
charter will be drafted in January, the Johannesburg-based news
agency said. The  Movement for Democratic Change , led by  Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , has asked the Southern African
Development Community to monitor the referendum, said Zimonline.  Zimbabweans are currently led by a power-sharing government
that joins the MDC and President Robert  Mugabe ’s  Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front . The power-sharing
agreement was brokered by SADC between April 2008 and February
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
