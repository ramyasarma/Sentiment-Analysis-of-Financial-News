Australian voter support for the
major political parties remains tied as Julia Gillard increased
her lead as preferred prime minister after forming government
following the deadlocked Aug. 21 election, according to an
opinion survey.  Gillard’s Labor Party and the opposition Liberal-National
coalition are tied at 50-50 on a two-party measure, according to
the Newspoll published in the Australian newspaper today.
Gillard is preferred leader with 52 percent support, up 2
percentage points since mid-September and increasing her lead
over opposition leader Tony Abbott to 21 points from 16 points,
according to the telephone survey of 1,141 voters on Oct. 7-9.
The primary vote for Labor and the coalition rose 1 percentage
point to 35 percent and 42 percent, respectively, while support
for the Greens was steady at 14 percent, the survey, which had a
3-percentage-point margin of error, showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
