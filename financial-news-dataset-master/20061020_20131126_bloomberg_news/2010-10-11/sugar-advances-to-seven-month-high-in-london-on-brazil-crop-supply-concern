Sugar rose to the highest price in
more than seven months in London on concern that adverse weather
may limit supplies from Brazil, the world’s largest producer of
the sweetener.  Brazil will harvest 3.2 percent less sugar cane than
previously estimated in the year that began May 1, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s attache in Sao Paulo said Oct. 4.
The nation’s south-central sugar cane growing region experienced
a four-month drought up to mid-September that damaged crops.  The rally is probably “more about fundamentals than
speculation,” said  Jonathan Kingsman , managing director of
Lausanne, Switzerland-based researcher and broker Kingsman SA.
“We can only guess that the Brazilian producers are concerned
that their production might disappoint.”  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery gained
$16.30, or 2.4 percent, to $693.90 a metric ton at 12:24 p.m. on

price since Feb. 22.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.75 cent, or 2.8
percent, to 27.07 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Prices reached 27.24 cents, the highest level since Feb. 12.  Robusta coffee for January delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$1,669 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for December delivery
