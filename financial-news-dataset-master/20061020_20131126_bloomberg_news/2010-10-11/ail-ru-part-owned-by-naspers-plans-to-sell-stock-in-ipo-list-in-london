Mail.ru Group Ltd., an internet
holding part-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and
South Africa’s Naspers Ltd., plans to sell stock in an initial
public offering in London by the end of the year.  About 10 percent to 15 percent of the internet company’s
shares will be tradeable after the IPO, according to a term
sheet for the sale obtained by Bloomberg News. All of the stock
is being sold by Mail.ru’s shareholders, according to the term
sheet. The company isn’t raising money by selling new stock.  Mail.ru holds 2.4 percent in Facebook Inc., 5.1 percent in
Groupon Inc. and 1.5 percent in Zynga Game Network Inc, the
company said today in a regulatory filing. It also controls the
Mail.ru e-mail service, Russian social network Odnoklassniki and
the ICQ instant messaging network.  The company hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Morgan Stanley and Russia’s state-run VTB Capital to manage
the sale, which will depend on market conditions, according to
the term sheet. Mail.ru may be valued at as much as $6 billion,
the Vedomosti newspaper reported Oct. 6.  The banks will begin taking orders for the shares on Oct.
25. The global depositary receipts are scheduled to begin
trading in London the week of Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
