Palm oil surged to a 26-month high,
tracking an advance in soybeans, which rallied after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture forecast a smaller global crop.  Futures for December delivery advanced 6.2 percent to 2,930
ringgit ($945) a metric ton, the highest closing price since Aug.
1, 2008, after touching 2,940 ringgit in intraday trade. Prices
gained for a sixth week last week, the longest winning run since
a seven-week advance ending May 8, 2009.  Soybeans output in the U.S. will be a record 3.408 billion
bushels (93 million tons), compared with 3.483 billion projected
in September and 3.359 billion gathered last year, the USDA said
on Oct. 8. August rainfall failed to boost yields, prompting the
government to reduce its acreage estimates.  “Crude palm oil prices may be ripe for a further upswing
given the USDA’s recent downgrade of soybean crop estimates and
the threat to oilseeds and edible oil supplies posed by the
ongoing La Nina,”  Ivy Ng , an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank
Bhd., said in a report today.  The brokerage raised its forecast for crude palm oil by 9
percent to an average 2,630 ringgit this year and as much as 14
percent to 2,800 ringgit for 2011. Prices have averaged 2,540
ringgit this year, according to Bloomberg data.  Soybean futures for November delivery in Chicago gained as
much as 4.4 percent to $11.8475 a bushel in Chicago, the highest
price since June 5 last year. The contract traded at $11.8475 a
bushel at 3:33 p.m. in Mumbai.  December-delivery soybean oil gained as much as 2.2 percent
to 47.64 cents a pound in Asia, the highest level since Sept. 29,
2008. Soybean oil and palm oil are direct substitutes.  Malaysian Exports  Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 0.4 percent in the first
10 days of October to 395,015 tons from the same period in
September, independent market surveyor Intertek said today.
Shipments fell 0.2 percent to 382,828 tons, rival Societe
Generale de Surveillance said.  “Strong economic growth for emerging economies and rising
biodiesel mandates are expected to boost demand prospects,”
CIMB’s Ng said. “Palm oil price upside in the near term may be
fuelled further by soybean production risks for South America.”  Growth in global vegetable oil supplies may lag demand for
a third year,  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd.
said last month. Palm oil has rallied 15 percent in the past six
months amid optimism demand will increase in Asia and on concern
excess rains will disrupt output in Indonesia and Malaysia.  Malaysian Output  Output in Malaysia, the second-biggest producer, fell 2.7
percent to 1,562,912 tons in September, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board said today. Stockpiles rose 0.2 percent to 1,708,101 tons
and exports gained 21.2 percent to 1,467,705 tons, it said.  On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, palm oil for delivery in
May jumped 5.6 percent to 8,184 yuan ($1,226) a ton, the highest
level at close since Aug. 1, 2008. Dalian May-delivery
soybean oil surged 4.5 percent to close at 8,918 yuan, the
highest since Sept. 4, 2008.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, which pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, surged as much as 5.4 percent
to $938.25 a ton, the highest level since the exchange began
trading the commodity in May. The commodity traded at $935.75 a
ton at 3:34 p.m. in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
