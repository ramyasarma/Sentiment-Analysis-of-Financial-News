South African coal exports to China
plunged in September while shipments to India increased from a
month earlier, said mjunction Services Ltd., a web-based trader.  China’s purchases fell by about 85 percent to 145,312
metric tons from August, said Kolkata-based mjunction, which is
backed by Tata Steel Ltd. and Steel Authority of India Ltd.
India purchased 1.87 million tons, 14 percent higher than a
month earlier.  Asia’s coal purchases from South Africa fell 26 percent to
3.32 million tons in September from August because of a decline
in Chinese and Japanese purchases while European imports rose 60
percent to more than 1 million tons led by France and Italy,
mjunction said. Purchases by Asia until September was about 32
million tons and Europe’s imports were 6.8 million.  At Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s biggest coal export
facility, shipments fell 1.6 percent in September from a month
earlier, according to data on the terminal’s website. The port,
on South Africa’s eastern coast, shipped 5.36 million tons in
September, down from 5.45 million tons in August. The terminal
had stocks of 4.3 million tons at the end of last month.  Prices for the fuel shipped through the terminal rose 42
percent to an average $86.24 a ton in September from the same
month a year earlier, according to data from Hampshire, U.K.-
based research firm IHS McCloskey. Prices rose to $87.85 a ton
in the week to Oct. 1.  India’s purchases in the first nine months of this year
from South Africa rose 16 percent to 15.2 million tons from a
year-earlier period, mjunction said. Chinese imports climbed to
4.8 million tons through September as lower freight rates
boosted shipments, compared with 1.52 million tons it imported
for the entire 2009.  The  Baltic Dry Index , the main measure of shipping costs
for commodities, has declined 14 percent this year, reducing
costs to send coal and iron ore to China and India from Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
