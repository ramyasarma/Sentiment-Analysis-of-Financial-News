Israel’s benchmark index  advanced to
a record as  Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd.  soared on plans to
take the world’s largest maker of generic agrochemicals private
and after the country’s economic growth accelerated this year.  The  TA-25 Index  gained 0.6 percent to 1,242.5 at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv, surpassing the previous closing high of
1,237.85 on April 6. The gauge of the country’s  25 largest
companies  has climbed 8.5 percent  this year , compared with a 4.5
percent increase for the  Standard & Poor’s 500  and a 3.6 percent
gain for the  MSCI World Index .  Makhteshim  jumped 27 percent
today.  “Improving earnings as economic growth quickens, the
admission to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development and an upgrade to developed market status by MSCI
Inc. are leading to increased interest in the local market,”  Ron Eichel , chief economist and strategist at Meitav Investment
House Ltd., said in a phone interview today. This trend should
continue and Israeli shares should advance further, he said.  The International Monetary Fund on Oct. 6 raised its growth
forecast for Israel to 4.2 percent in 2010 from its April
prediction of 3.2 percent. Economic growth accelerated to 4.6
percent in the second quarter from 3.8 percent in the previous
three months, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Sept. 16.  Israel’s gauge more than doubled from a 2008 low driven by
energy shares such as Delek Drilling LP and Avner Oil
Exploration LP after the country’s largest discoveries of
natural gas were made in the Tamar and Leviathan finds in the
Mediterranean Sea off Israel’s coast. The gauge reached an all-
time intraday high of 1,248.8 in November 2007.  12 Years  Koor Industries Ltd. , which is controlled by  Nochi Dankner ’s  IDB Holding Corp.  and  Discount Investment Corp. , said
it will sell a 17 percent stake in  Makhteshim  to China National
Chemical Corp., which also would buy the publicly held shares,
it said today. The deal values Makhteshim at about $2.72
billion. Makhteshim  surged  the most in at least 12 years to 17
shekels. Discount rose 6.3 percent to 83 shekels.  “At the end of the day, it depends on the U.S. stock
market where there are obstacles but we’re not pessimistic about
the U.S. and think the index can increase another 10 percent in
the next 12 months,” Eichel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
