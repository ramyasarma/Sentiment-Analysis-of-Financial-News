General Motors Co. , the biggest
overseas automaker in China, said sales increased 15 percent in
the country in September on strong demand for Buick, Chevrolet
and Cadillac products.  GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 208,353 units last
month, it said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales from
Shanghai General Motors Corp, the joint-venture with SAIC Motor
Co., totaled 100,786 vehicles, it said.  The sales growth is a decline from the 19.2 percent
reported for August, which was then the slowest rate in at least
17 months as government stimulus measures wore off. Some Chinese
auto dealers have stepped up incentives to lure customers in the
world’s largest auto market.  In the first nine months, GM sales jumped 37.4 percent to a
record 1.8 million units, the company said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
