Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  climbed for

snapped two days of declines, adding 0.1 percent to 6,699 by

excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Kenya Airways Ltd.  (KNAL KN) fell to the lowest level in
nine months, dropping 1 shilling, or 2.3 percent, to 43
shillings on speculation over a workers strike that may begin
Oct. 13, said Gregory Waweru, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. “Investors need clarity from
management on news that employees might go on strike,”  Sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest airline’s employees have
no plans to strike, Bonne Nicholas Barasa, secretary general of
the Aviation and Allied Workers Union told Bloomberg News Oct.
6. That contradicts union Chairman Moss Ndiema, who Reuters
reported on Oct. 6 as saying 5,000 employees across Kenya’s
aviation industry would go on strike from Oct. 13.  Oando Plc  (OANDO NL) climbed 24 kobo, or 0.4 percent, to 60
naira. The Nigerian petroleum products company was rated “buy”
in new coverage at Renaissance Capital, which estimates
operating profit and cash flow at will rise 40 percent in the
next fiscal year and 2012.  The price estimate of the company, based in Lagos, was set
at 80 naira per share, 34 percent higher than its closing price
on Oct. 8, analysts including  Dragan Trajkov  wrote in a note to
clients dated today.  Oceanic Bank International Plc  (OCEANIC NL), a Nigerian
lender rescued by the central bank last year, rose to a two-week
high, gaining 5 kobo, or 4.3 percent, to 1.21 naira, on bets it
will repay the funds injected into the bank after its former
chief executive forfeited assets.  Cecilia Ibru  agreed to forfeit 191.4 billion naira ($1.27
billion) of assets after being convicted of bank fraud and
sentenced to 18 months in jail by a Nigerian High Court on Oct.
8. The assets include properties in the U.S., Dubai and Nigeria
and shares in 100 companies, the Abuja-based Central Bank of
Nigeria said in a statement on its website. “With this, it is
clear that Oceanic Bank will soon be in the position to return
to the CBN the 100 billion naira injected into the bank and also
get adequately recapitalized and thus survive the banking
crisis,” the regulator said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
