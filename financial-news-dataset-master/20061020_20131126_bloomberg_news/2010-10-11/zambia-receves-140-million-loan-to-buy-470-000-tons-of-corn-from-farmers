Zambia ’s Food Reserve Agency secured
a $140 million loan to buy 470,000 metric tons of corn,  Audit
Control & Expertise Group  said.  Standard Chartered Plc  was the lead arranger of the loan,
the Geneva-based credit institution’s Ugandan unit said in a
statement published in the Kampala-based New Vision newspaper
today. The Zambian government will guarantee 30 percent of the
value of the loan, it said  The funds will benefit more than 300,000 small-scale
farmers in the southern African country by enabling them to
receive fair market prices for their crops, ACE said. The credit
will also contribute to Zambia’s supply of staple foods, it
said.  The Food Reserve Agency is spending 150 billion Zambian
kwacha ($31.6 million) a week buying corn from farmers to secure
the crop before the rainy season begins, the Lusaka-based Post
newspaper reported last week. Zambia’s rainy season usually
starts in mid-November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
