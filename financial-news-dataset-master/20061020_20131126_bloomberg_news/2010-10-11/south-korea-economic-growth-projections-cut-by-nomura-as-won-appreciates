Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its
economic growth forecast for South Korea for this year to 5.9
percent from 6 percent, citing weaker exports and construction
investment.  Nomura expects the Korean economy to expand 3.5 percent in
2011, less than the previous forecast of 4 percent,  Kwon Young Sun , senior economist based in Hong Kong, said in a report dated
Oct. 8. The won is likely to gain to 1,075 to the dollar at year
end, he said. At 9:52 a.m. in Hong Kong today, it traded at
1,113.80 to the dollar.  “Even though CPI inflation is now above the mid-point of
the BOK’s target band (3.0%), we are changing our rate call to
reflect our GDP forecast downgrades and the policy bias toward
growth, especially given our forecast of KRW appreciation,”
 Kwon  said in the report.  The Bank of Korea left its benchmark interest rate at 2.25
percent in September and August as policy makers weighed
inflation risks against slower global growth. No rate move is
expected until the second half of 2011 as a stronger won,
coupled with a slump in the local housing market, could derail
growth in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, Nomura’s Kwon said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
