Credit Agricole SA ’s purchase of 172
bank branches from  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  should be reviewed
locally, rather than by the  European Commission , because it will
only affect the local market, Italy’s antitrust regulator said.  The Italian regulator maintains it is in the best position
to evaluate the deal because it recently had experience with
similar transactions, an antitrust official, who declined to be
identified citing agency policy, said by phone. The Commission
said on  its website  today that it will decide on the request by
Nov. 10.  Credit Agricole, France’s largest bank by branches, agreed
in June to buy Intesa’s majority stake in Cassa di Risparmio
della Spezia, a lender with 76 branches in the Liguria, Tuscany
and Emilia Romagna regions and 96 other Intesa branches located
in northern and central Italy for about 740 million euros ($910
million) to expand its consumer-banking network in Italy.  A spokeswoman at Credit Agricole in Paris declined to
comment on the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
