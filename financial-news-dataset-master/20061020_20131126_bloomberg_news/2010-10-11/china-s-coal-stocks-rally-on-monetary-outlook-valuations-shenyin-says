The outlook for further quantitative
easing measures by central banks globally and low valuations are
catalysts for the rally in China’s coal stocks, according to
Shenyin and Wanguo Securities Co.  The brokerage recommends Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. and Shanxi
Lu’an Environmental Energy Development Co. as its top picks for
coal stocks because they are cheaper than rivals, analysts led
by Zhan Lingyan wrote in a report today.  Prices of thermal coal are expected to rise between 3
percent and 10 percent in the following three months as the
weather turns cold, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
