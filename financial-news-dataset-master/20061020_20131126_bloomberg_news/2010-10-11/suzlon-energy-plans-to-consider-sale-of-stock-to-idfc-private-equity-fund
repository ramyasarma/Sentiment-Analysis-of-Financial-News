Suzlon Energy Ltd. , India’s
largest wind-turbine maker, said it will consider today a
proposal to sell 31.99 million shares to IDFC Private Equity
Fund in a no-cash transaction.  IDFC Private Equity , which invests in Indian infrastructure
companies, will get preference shares in Suzlon in return for
stock it holds in Suzlon unit  SE Forge Ltd. , it said in a
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange today.  “This is a transfer of IDFC’s stake to the parent
company and no money is involved,” Anoop Kharayat, Suzlon’s
spokesman, said by telephone. Pune, western India-based SE
Forge will become a wholly owned unit of Suzlon after the
transaction, he said.  Suzlon’s shares climbed 2.3 percent to 58.75 rupees at
11:33 a.m. local time  in Mumbai . India’s 30-share benchmark
Sensitive index, or Sensex, advanced 0.3 percent. The
stock has fallen 35 percent this year compared with a 16 percent
gain in the Sensex.  Suzlon, which reported a loss of 9.1 billion rupees ($205
million) for the three months ended June, is seeking funds to
expand its presence in the U.S. and Europe. Suzlon in May agreed
to 106 billion rupees of loans from lenders led by  IDBI Bank Ltd. 
and  State Bank of India  to refinance existing debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This deal with IDFC won’t bring in any money for
Suzlon,” said  Krishnakant Thakur , Mumbai-based analyst with
Quant Broking Pvt. “This also means there’s no chance of Suzlon
listing its forging unit.” Thakur has a “sell” rating on
Suzlon Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
