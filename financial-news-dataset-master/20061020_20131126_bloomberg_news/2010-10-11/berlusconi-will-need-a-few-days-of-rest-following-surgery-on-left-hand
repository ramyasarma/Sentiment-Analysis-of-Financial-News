Prime Minister Silvio Bersluconi
will need “a few days of rest” after undergoing surgery on his
left hand to relieve pain related to carpal tunnel syndrome.  The surgery lasted about 15 minutes at the Istituto Clinico
Humanitas in Rozzano near Milan, his surgeon, Alberto Lazzerini,
said in an e-mailed statement. The operation was “perfectly
successful,” the e-mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
