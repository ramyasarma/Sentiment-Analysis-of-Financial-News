Moody’s Investors Service raised the
outlook on Ukraine’s sovereign credit rating to “stable,”
citing the nation’s ability to service external debt and a
return to economic growth.  Moody’s rates Ukraine B2, five steps below investment
grade. The outlook change indicates the ratings company is more
inclined to leave the grade unchanged than cut it.  Ukraine’s ability to meet its debt obligations improved
after the country agreed to a new $15.2 billion loan program
with the International Monetary Fund program in July. The
agreement also helped Ukraine raise $2 billion by selling
Eurobonds last month, the first such offering since 2007.  “A stronger external position along with the economic
recovery has reduced Ukraine’s susceptibility to financial
stress,”  Dietmar Hornung , a Frankfurt-based senior credit
analyst at Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement. “Along with
the fresh infusion of funds, the IMF program’s conditionality is
one of the factors that has improved the investment climate,
thereby facilitating the successful Eurobond issuance.”  Ukraine’s economy grew 5.9 percent in the second quarter
after advancing 4.9 percent in the previous three months, the
state statistics office said Sept. 30. The expansion, helped by
exports, came after the economy shrank 15.1 percent in 2009, the
biggest slump in 15 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
