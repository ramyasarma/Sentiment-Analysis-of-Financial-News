The U.K. government should use its
buying power and credit rating to cut procurement costs,  Philip Green , the billionaire owner of  Arcadia Group Ltd. , has
concluded after a two-month examination of departmental
accounts.  According to the Cabinet Office, which will publish the
full report today, Green found evidence of different departments
paying widely varying prices for the same goods, and poor data
quality in procurement control. The Sunday Telegraph reported
yesterday the government was paying 10 million pounds ($16
million) a year to rent empty offices.  “There is no reason why government should not be as
efficient as any good business,” Green said in an e-mailed
statement. “The conclusion of this review is clear -- credit
rating and scale in virtually every department has not been used
to make government spending efficient.”  The announcement, with its criticism of the previous Labour
Party administration that lost power after May’s general
election, will be part of an effort by Conservative Prime
Minister  David Cameron  to regain the initiative after being
forced on to the defensive last week over plans to cut welfare.  Cameron will hold his first full press conference as Prime
Minister today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
