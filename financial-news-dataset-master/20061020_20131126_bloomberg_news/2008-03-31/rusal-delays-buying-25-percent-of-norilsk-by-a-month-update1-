             United Co. Rusal, the Russian
aluminum company controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska,
delayed the purchase of 25 percent of  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN)  by a
month, citing ``technical'' issues.  
 Rusal will finish buying the stake from billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  by May, not by April, the Moscow-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The ``main parameters'' of the
sale remain intact, the company said, without elaborating.  
 ``The original legal agreements stipulated the deadline as
end of April, so there is no delay in this sense,'' Vera Kurochkina, spokeswoman for Rusal, said by phone in Moscow today.
Rusal and the seller, billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, planned to
complete the deal in March, the two sides said in December.  
 Prokhorov stands to gain 11 percent of Rusal and an
unspecified cash amount after selling the Norilsk holding, as he
seeks to part ways with business partner  Vladimir Potanin , who
also owns about a quarter of the nickel miner.  
 Potanin has supported Norilsk merging with iron ore producer
OAO Metalloinvest, which may complicate Rusal's goals to acquire
control in the mining company.
