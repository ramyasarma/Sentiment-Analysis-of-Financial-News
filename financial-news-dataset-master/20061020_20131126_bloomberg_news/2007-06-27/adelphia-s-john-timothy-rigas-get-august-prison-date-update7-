             Adelphia Communications Corp. founder
John Rigas and his son Timothy were ordered to report to prison
by Aug. 13 to begin sentences for looting their cable-TV company.  
 U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand in  Manhattan  set the date
today for John Rigas, 82, sentenced to 15 years, and  Timothy
Rigas , 51, the former finance chief, sentenced to 20 years. The
judge denied them bail during appeals of their 2004 convictions.  
 ``Practically, what you have here is a guy who's already
lost all but an insignificant appeal of his case,'' said Jeff Ifrah, a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm
 Greenberg Traurig  in  Washington . ``Everyone knows that it
wouldn't have an impact upon his sentence.''  
 John Rigas is the oldest top executive convicted in the wave
of U.S. prosecutions that started after Enron Corp. went bankrupt
in 2001. Ex-WorldCom Inc. Chairman Bernard Ebbers, 65, is serving
a 25-year term for securities fraud. Ex-Cendant Corp. Chairman
Walter Forbes, 64, is to begin a 12-year sentence July 16.  
 The Rigases were convicted of conspiracy,  securities fraud 
and bank fraud. They have been free on bail in Coudersport,
 Pennsylvania , where John Rigas started Adelphia in 1952. It was
the fifth-largest U.S. cable provider before its 2002 collapse.  
 An appeals court last month upheld the Rigases' convictions.
A further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is planned, and the
men have separately challenged a bank fraud conviction, defense
lawyer John Nields told Sand today, arguing without success to
keep them at liberty.  
 `Too Much Time'  
 ``Too much time has elapsed from the time of conviction of
these defendants on these very serious charges and the time they
begin serving sentence,'' the judge said.  
 Sand said he imposed the sentences in 2005, almost a year
after a 5 1/2-month trial ended with their convictions.  
 ``So we are here today, toward the end of June 2007, and
dealing with the sentence imposed in June 2005,'' he said.  
 Peter Fleming, a lawyer for  John Rigas , told the judge much
of the time since the sentencing was consumed by complicated
financial issues, such as the amount of restitution and fines the
men would pay.  
 Assistant U.S. Attorney William Johnson argued against bail.
He noted the men were convicted of 15 counts each of securities
fraud. ``Every one of those counts has a 10-year exposure,''
Johnson said.  
 The Rigases declined to comment after the hearing, as did
their attorneys.  
 John Rigas's Health  
 The U.S. Bureau of Prisons will tell the men where to report
to serve their sentences, the judge said. They aren't eligible
for a minimum-security camp because their sentences are longer
than 10 years, said Ifrah, the former prosecutor, co-author of
the book ``Federal Sentencing for Business Crimes.''  
 John Rigas had heart surgery in 1999 and has bladder cancer.
He may leave prison after serving two years if doctors say he has
less than three months to live, Sand said at an earlier hearing.  
 ``You don't get to stay out of jail because of your age,''
said Leslie Caldwell, a former lead prosecutor of Enron cases now
at the  law firm  Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in  New York . ``I presume
he was pretty old when he committed the offenses which he was
convicted of.''  
 The Rigases were found guilty of lying about the source of
$1.6 billion used to buy company stock and debt and stealing
$51 million in cash advances.  
 They spent $26.5 million in company money to buy timberland
near their home and $13 million to build an Adelphia golf course
on land owned by the company and the family, prosecutors said.
Adelphia also paid for antiques, family homes and a personal
trainer, witnesses said.  
 Collapse in 2002  
 The jury deadlocked on charges against another son, Michael,
ex-Adelphia operations chief. He pleaded guilty to falsifying
records later and was sentenced to 10 months' home confinement.  
 Adelphia began its collapse on March 27, 2002, when it
disclosed the Rigases owed $2.3 billion in off-balance-sheet debt
on bank loans taken jointly with the company. Within weeks, the
Rigases resigned, Adelphia filed for bankruptcy and John, Timothy
and Michael Rigas were arrested.  
 Last July,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  bought
Adelphia's cable properties for $17.6 billion. On Jan. 3, a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved the company's plan to
emerge from bankruptcy, pay creditors and cease doing business.
The company is now based in  Greenwood Village ,  Colorado .  
 The case is U.S. v. Rigas, 1:02-cr-01236, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
