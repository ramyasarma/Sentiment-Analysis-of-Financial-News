Pitcher  Javier Vazquez  has agreed to
a one-year contract with the Florida Marlins after going 10-10
with a 5.32 earned run average for the New York Yankees last
season,  MLB.com reports .  Vazquez, a 34-year-old right-hander, was left off the
Yankees’ roster in the playoffs after logging his highest ERA
since his rookie season in 1998.  Vazquez has a 152-149 record with a 4.26 ERA over 13 Major
League Baseball seasons. His contract with the Marlins is worth
between $6 million and $7 million, MLB.com said, citing multiple
sources it didn’t identify.  The Yankees would receive a supplemental round pick in
June’s first-year player draft for Vazquez, who became a free
agent after the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
