Third-quarter gold production in
Australia gained 22 percent compared with the same period a year
ago, as prices remained high, a research group said.  Production climbed to 67 metric tons in the three months
ended Sept. 30, 12 tons more than a year ago,  Sandra Close , a
director of Melbourne-based  Surbiton Associates Pty , said in an
e-mailed statement.  Gold is headed for a 10th annual gain and prices may
average $1,375 an ounce during the first quarter of 2011,
National Australia Bank Ltd. said Nov. 23. Regis Resources Ltd.
and Integra Mining Ltd. began output last quarter, Surbiton said.  “We are now seeing the results of a sustained period of
higher gold prices,” Close said. “We are now seeing the
effects of re-evaluation of known deposits and the bringing of
old mines back into production, as well as some new finds, so
output is increasing.”  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. this month approved development of
the A$600 million ($583 million) Tropicana gold project in
Western Australia.
