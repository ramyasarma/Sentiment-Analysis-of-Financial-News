The number of reported new HIV
infections in Singapore was 373 in the first 10 months of 2010
and the government expects the total number of cases this year
to be close to the 463 reported in 2009.  Of the 169 cases investigated about 60 percent were in the
late stage of infection, the Ministry of Health said in a
statement on its website yesterday. More than 90 percent of the
infected were male, the government said, adding that sexual
contact remains the main mode of HIV transmission.  The remaining 204 cases are still being investigated, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
