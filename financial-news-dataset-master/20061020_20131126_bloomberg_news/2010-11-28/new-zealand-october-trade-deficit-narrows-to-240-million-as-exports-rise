New Zealand’s trade deficit narrowed
more than economists predicted in October as exports rose faster
than imports amid increased global prices for dairy products.  The shortfall was NZ$319 million ($240 million) from a
revised NZ$457 million deficit in September, Statistics New
Zealand said today in Wellington. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists was for a NZ$400 million
deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
