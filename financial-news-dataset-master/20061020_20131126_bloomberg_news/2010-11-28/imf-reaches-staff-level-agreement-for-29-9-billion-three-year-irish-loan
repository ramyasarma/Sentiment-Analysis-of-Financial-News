The International Monetary Fund said
it reached a staff-level agreement to contribute about 22.5
billion euros ($29.9 billion) to an international bailout plan
for Ireland.  The IMF has activated its “fast-track procedures” for the
board to consider the three-year loan, which is part of an 85
billion-euro package with the European Union and European
bilateral lenders, Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said
in an e-mailed statement. He said he expects the fund’s board to
approve the request in December.  “The Irish authorities have today proposed a clear and
realistic package of policies to restore Ireland’s banking
system to health and put its public finances on a sound
footing,” Strauss-Kahn said. “In recent years, Ireland has
resolutely carried out bold policies in a very challenging
environment, and I have confidence in its ability to implement
this new program.”  Ireland became the second euro country to seek a rescue
after the Greek debt crisis earlier this year destabilized the
currency and forced the EU to set up a 750 billion-euro rescue
fund backed by the IMF  The type of loan that was agreed on, the so-called Extended
Fund Facility, allows Ireland to start paying back later than in
standard IMF funding. Repayments would start after 4 ½ years and
end after 10 years, the institution said.  At today’s rate, the interest rate charged to Ireland by
the IMF would be an average 3.12 percent for the first three
years “at the peak level of access,” the Washington-based
lender said in an e-mail. It would be “just under 4 percent”
after three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
