The San Diego Chargers intercepted
 Peyton Manning  four times, returning two for touchdowns, in a
36-14 victory over the Indianapolis Colts that extends their
National Football League winning streak to four games.  Manning has 16 interceptions in seven career games against
the Chargers (6-5), who are the first team to win in
Indianapolis this season. It was the worst home loss for the
Colts (6-5) since 1997 and means their run of seven straight 12-
win seasons will come to an end.  “They’re an excellent defense and they got after us,”
Manning said during a news conference. “We need to regroup.
This was not our night, for sure, on offense.”  Manning’s struggles capped a day during which younger
brother Eli rallied the New York Giants from an 11-point
halftime deficit to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 24-20.  The Giants ended a two-game losing streak and improved to
7-4, the same record as division-rival Philadelphia, which lost
yesterday in Chicago 31-26. It was the Eagles’ first loss this
season in a game in which  Michael Vick  played throughout.  The Atlanta Falcons beat the Green Bay Packers 20-17 to
push their winning streak to an NFL-best five games and tie the
New York Jets and New England Patriots for the best record in
the NFL at 9-2. The Patriots host the Jets on Dec. 6.  The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Buffalo Bills 19-16 in
overtime yesterday and the Minnesota Vikings won 17-13 against
the Washington Redskins in  Leslie Frazier ’s debut as coach.  Giants Rally  At New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey,
the Giants trailed 17-6 at halftime and then outscored the
Jaguars 18-3 during the second half.  Eli Manning  threw fourth-quarter touchdown passes to  Mario Manningham  and  Kevin Boss  to give New York the lead with 3:15
remaining. The Giants’ defense then recorded three straight
sacks of Jaguars quarterback  David Garrard , the last producing a
fumble that clinched the win.  “We knew we had to come out and play better in the second
half,” Manning said. “Offensively we said, ‘Hey, we’re doing
some good things, we just have to finish drives.’ The defense
obviously played outstanding in the second half.”  The Eagles’ three-game win streak was ended in Chicago as
Bears quarterback  Jay Cutler  threw four touchdown passes.  Vick threw for 333 yards and two scores, yet also was
intercepted for the first time this season. The Eagles had been
5-0 in games that Vick started and finished this season. They
lost in Week 4 against Washington after Vick was knocked out in
the first quarter with a rib injury.  ‘Hate to Lose’  “I hate to lose,” Vick said. “It makes me sick, it makes
me ill, but we’re not going to win every game. I know we’re
definitely going to win more than we lose.”  The Bears improved to 8-3 and open a one-game lead in the
National Football Conference’s North Division over the Packers,
who fell to 7-4 with their loss in Atlanta.  The Falcons improved to 6-0 at the Georgia Dome as  Matt Bryant  kicked a 47-yard field goal with 13 seconds remaining.  Michael Turner  rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown for
Atlanta, while quarterback  Matt Ryan  improved to 19-1 in his
career as a starter at home. Ryan’s .950 winning percentage ties
Dallas’s  Danny White  for the best over 20 home starts for
quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era.  Aaron Rodgers  threw for 344 yards and a touchdown, and had
a rushing score for the Packers, who had a four-game winning
streak snapped.  At Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo,  Shaun Suisham  made a
41-yard kick with 2:14 left in overtime for the Steelers (8-3).  New Kicker  Suisham went 4-for-4 on field goal attempts -- all beyond
40 yards -- in his debut for the Steelers, who signed him after
cutting  Jeff Reed  last week.  Rashard Mendenhall  rushed for 151 yards and a touchdown for
Pittsburgh, which opened a 13-0 halftime lead before the Bills
(2-9) rallied. The Steelers are tied atop the AFC North with the
Baltimore Ravens, who improved to 8-3 with a 17-10 home win over
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  The Ravens host the Steelers on Dec. 6.  The Kansas City Chiefs (7-4) maintained a one-game lead
over San Diego in the AFC West with a 42-24 win in Seattle.  Elsewhere in Week 12, it was Houston 20, Tennessee 0;
Cleveland 24, Carolina 23; Miami 33, Oakland 17; and St. Louis
36, Denver 33. In Thanksgiving Day games played four days ago,
it was the Jets 26, Cincinnati 10; New England 45, Detroit 24;
and New Orleans 30, Dallas 27.  The San Francisco 49ers visit Arizona tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
