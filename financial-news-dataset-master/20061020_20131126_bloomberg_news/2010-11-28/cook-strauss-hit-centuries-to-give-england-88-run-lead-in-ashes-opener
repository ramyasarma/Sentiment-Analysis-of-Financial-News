Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss hit
centuries as England fought back to take an 88-run lead over
Australia on day four of the series-opening Ashes cricket Test
in Brisbane.  Cook struck an unbeaten 132, while captain Strauss scored
110 as the opening pair shared an England-record 188-run stand
to help lift the touring team to 309-1 when bad light ended play
seven overs early. Cook added 121 runs for the second wicket
with Jonathan Trott, who was 54 not out at stumps.   Resuming at 19-0, openers Cook and Strauss boosted
England’s chances of avoiding defeat in the first match of the
best-of-five contest after centuries by Mike Hussey and Brad
Haddin yesterday lifted Australia to a 221-run lead on the first
innings.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
