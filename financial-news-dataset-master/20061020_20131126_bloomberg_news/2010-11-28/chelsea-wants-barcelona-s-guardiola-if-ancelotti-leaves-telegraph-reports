Chelsea will move for Barcelona
coach Pep Guardiola if Carlo Ancelotti decides to quit at the
end of the season, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Guardiola’s contract ends next year and Chelsea hopes a
planned move for Barcelona’s Director of Football Txiki
Begiristain will convince the coach to join, the newspaper said,
without citing anyone.  Ancelotti has said he is not considering his future, but is
unhappy at the firing of assistant manager Ray Wilkins and will
lose another ally when Sporting Director Frank Arnesen leaves
after this season, the Telegraph said.  Arnesen said yesterday in a statement on Chelsea’s website
that he will leave his post.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
