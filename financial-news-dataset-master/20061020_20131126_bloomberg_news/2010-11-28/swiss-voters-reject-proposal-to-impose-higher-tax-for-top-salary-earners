Switzerland’s voters rejected a
proposal to increase taxes for the nation’s top earners,
following the recommendations of most national leaders.  In a referendum today,  59 percent  of voters turned down the
proposal by the Social Democrats to enact minimum taxes on
income and wealth. Residents would have paid taxes of at least
22 percent on annual income above 250,000 francs ($249,000),
according to the proposed changes.  Switzerland’s  executive  and parliamentary branches had
rejected the proposal, saying it would interfere with the
cantons’ tax-autonomy regulations. The changes would also damage
the nation’s attractiveness, the government, led by President
 Doris Leuthard , said before the vote.  The Alpine country’s reputation as a low-tax refuge has
attracted bankers and entrepreneurs such as  Ingvar Kamprad , the
Swedish founder of Ikea AB furniture stores, and members of the
Brenninkmeijer family, who owns retailer C&A Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
