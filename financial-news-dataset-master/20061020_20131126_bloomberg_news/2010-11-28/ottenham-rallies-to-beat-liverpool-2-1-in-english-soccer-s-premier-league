Tottenham rallied to beat Liverpool
2-1 today to climb one spot to fifth in English soccer’s Premier
League.  Martin Skrtel gave Liverpool a 42nd minute lead at White
Hart Lane, but then deflected the ball into his own team’s net
midway through the second half. Lennon got Tottenham’s winning
goal in injury time.  Liverpool drops one position to 10th.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
