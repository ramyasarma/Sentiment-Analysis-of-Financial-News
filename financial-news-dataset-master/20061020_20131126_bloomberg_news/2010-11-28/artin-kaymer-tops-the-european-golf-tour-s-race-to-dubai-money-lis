Martin Kaymer  finished the European
Tour golf season atop the “Race to Dubai” money list after
 Graeme McDowell  failed to secure a top-three finish at the Dubai
World Championship -- the year’s final event.  Germany’s Kaymer tied for 13th with Northern Ireland’s
McDowell at this week’s event after finishing eight shots off
winner  Robert Karlsson  of Sweden, who beat England’s  Ian Poulter 
in a playoff.  “I am very satisfied with my year,” Kaymer told
reporters. “All of the goals that I set for myself, for my
career, everything happened this year.”  Kaymer secured about 4.5 million euros ($6 million) in
European Tour prize money and bonus this season. At age 25
years, 335 days, he becomes the youngest player to end a season
as No. 1 since Ronan Rafferty of Ireland in 1989.  Kaymer’s four wins in 2010 included the U.S. PGA
Championship, one of eight European Tour titles for the German
in his career. McDowell also won a major this year -- the U.S.
Open. Both players helped Europe regain the Ryder Cup.  Today, Karlsson secured victory in the Dubai World
Championship at the second extra hole when he holed a birdie
putt, while Poulter had a bogey six. They’d finished on 14-under
in regulation play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
