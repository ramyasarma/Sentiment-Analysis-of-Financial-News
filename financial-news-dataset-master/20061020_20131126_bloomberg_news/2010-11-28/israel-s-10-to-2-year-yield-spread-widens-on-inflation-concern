The extra yield that investors
demand to hold Israeli 10-year bonds over two-year notes rose to
a two-month high on concern the Bank of Israel may fail to curb
accelerating inflation.  The yield spread between 10-year and two-year debt was 196
basis points at 3:42 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the widest since Sept.
13. The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 increased 3 basis points to 4.54 percent. The Bank of
Israel on Nov. 22 held the benchmark interest rate at 2 percent.  “Investors in bonds in the longer-term part of the curve
are worried that perhaps inflation may get out of hand after the
central bank held rates,” said  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist
at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  The inflation rate increased to 2.5 percent in October from
2.4 percent in September as food and housing prices climbed.
Inflation is expected to accelerate to about 2.8 percent in the
next 12 months, according to the central bank’s latest poll of
forecasters.  The shekel weakened 0.8 percent to 3.6777 per dollar on
Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
