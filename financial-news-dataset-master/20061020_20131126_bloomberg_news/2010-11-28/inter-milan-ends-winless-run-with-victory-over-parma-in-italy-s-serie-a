Defending champion Inter Milan ended
a run of four winless league games with a 5-2 victory against
Parma in Italian soccer’s Serie A.  Dejan Stankovic  got three goals yesterday, while  Esteban Cambiasso  and  Thiago Motta  also scored as Inter moved to fifth
spot on 23 points.  Leader AC Milan has 30 after a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria two
days ago and other leading teams failed to take advantage of the
“Rossoneri” dropping points.  Second-place Lazio has 27 points after a 1-1 draw with
Catania, Juventus is on 24 following a 1-1 tie with Fiorentina,
and Napoli is also on 24 after a 3-1 loss at Udinese.  Real Madrid and champion Barcelona, the clubs who lead the
Spanish standings, meet tonight at Barca’s Camp Nou stadium.  Real has a one-point lead over its archrival. Villarreal is
four points further back after a 3-0 win at Real Zaragoza two
days ago, two ahead of Espanyol which had a 3-2 victory at
Atletico Madrid.  Borussia Dortmund still leads Germany’s Bundesliga by seven
points after a 4-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach two days
ago. Mainz, in second, beat Nuremberg 3-0 two days ago.  Yesterday,  Hugo Almeida  got all the goals and was red-
carded as mid-table Werder Bremen beat St. Pauli 3-0.  Champion Marseille went top of the French standings with a
4-0 win over Montpellier two days ago. It leads Lille, which
drew 1-1 at Bordeaux, on goal difference. Montpellier is a point
behind. Paris Saint-Germain failed to go a point clear at the
top after a 2-2 tie at Lyon in the yesterday’s game.  In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven lost 4-2 at NAC Breda
three days ago and leads on goal difference from FC Twente, a 4-
2 winner at NEC Nijmegen two days ago.  WEEKEND RESULTS
