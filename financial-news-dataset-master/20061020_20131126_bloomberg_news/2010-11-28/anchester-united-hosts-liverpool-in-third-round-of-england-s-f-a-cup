Manchester United, the record 11-
time champion of English soccer’s F.A. Cup, will host Liverpool
in the only all-Premier League match in the third round.  United last won the competition in 2004, two years before
Liverpool’s most recent success. Defending champion Chelsea has
a home game against Ipswich Town, which plays in the second-tier
Championship.  The third round is the stage at which clubs from the elite
Premier League and the Championship enter the competition. Games
are scheduled for the weekend of Jan. 8 and 9.  Leicester City manager  Sven-Goran Eriksson  will host his
former club Manchester City, while last season’s runnerup
Portsmouth faces a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion or FC United
of Manchester -- a club set up in protest at the takeover of
United by the Glazer family.  Arsenal, aiming to tie United’s record 11 successes, is at
home against Leeds United. The Gunners are without a trophy
since winning the competition in 2005.  The third-round draw was made today after the weekend’s
second-round games.
