Qantas Airways Ltd. ’s flight QF31
carrying Chief Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  arrived in London
today, the first of the airline’s Airbus SAS A380s to resume
service since an engine explosion on Nov. 4.  The flight from Sydney via Singapore landed at Heathrow at
6:17 a.m., according to the Qantas  website  and BAA Ltd., which
operates the airport.  Qantas, Australia’s largest airline, grounded its fleet of
six A380s when a Rolls-Royce Group Plc Trent 900 engine exploded
over Indonesia, forcing an emergency return to Singapore. The
Sydney-based carrier will put another of the world’s biggest
passenger planes into service next week, and plans to add two
new aircraft from Airbus before Dec. 25.  Another Qantas flight bound for London via Bangkok was
delayed yesterday after an indicator showed an engine fault as
the aircraft taxied toward the runway. The Boeing Co. 747
returned to the terminal at Sydney to repair a wiring problem,
Qantas spokesman Thomas Woodward said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
