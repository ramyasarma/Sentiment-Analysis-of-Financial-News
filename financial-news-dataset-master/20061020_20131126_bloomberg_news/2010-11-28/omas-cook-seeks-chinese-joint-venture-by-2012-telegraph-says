Thomas Cook Group Plc, a European
tour operator, wants to agree on a joint venture with a Chinese

strategy, which also includes India and Russia, the Telegraph
reported. The deal is likely to be similar to the one Thomas
Cook completed with the Russian venture Intourist, Fontenla-
Novoa said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
