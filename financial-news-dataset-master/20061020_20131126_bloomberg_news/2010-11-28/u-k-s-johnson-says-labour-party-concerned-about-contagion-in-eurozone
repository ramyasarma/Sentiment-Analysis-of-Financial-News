Alan Johnson, Treasury spokesman for
the U.K. opposition Labour Party, supports the coalition
government’s decision to lend money to Ireland and said he was
worried about the future of the eurozone.  “I am concerned about contagion, about what’s happening in
Spain and Portugal,” Johnson told the BBC’s “Andrew Marr
Show.” “We should be worried about the eurozone. This is
happening at the same time we’re still feeling the effects of
the global economic crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
