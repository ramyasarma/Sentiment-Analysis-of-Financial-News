U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down for the fourth time in five
days, as Ireland’s bailout failed to ease investor concern that
Europe’s debt crisis may spread to the southern region.  The S&P 500 rallied in the final 90 minutes of trading,
almost wiping out a 1.3 percent drop, as the measure bounced off
a  level  watched by chart analysts.  Hewlett-Packard Co.  and
Verizon Communications Inc. lost at least 1 percent, pacing
declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Visa Inc.  sank 1.7
percent as an analyst said mobile-network operators may take
market share.  Wells Fargo & Co.  and Bank of America Corp. led a
rally in financial shares, gaining more than 1.6 percent.  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.1 percent to 1,187.76 as of 4 p.m.
in New York, after earlier falling below its average price of
the last 50 days of 1,177. The Dow lost 39.51 points, or 0.4
percent, to 11,052.49.  “There seems to be plenty to bother the market,” said  E. William Stone,  who oversees about $105 billion as chief
investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia.
“There’s concern about the European financial crisis affecting
healthier economies and the viability of the euro. This issue
seems to be far from over. I’m not sure that the market is going
to be happy with much of anything right now.”  Asset Purchases  The  S&P 500  is still 16 percent above this year’s low
reached on July 2 as companies reported better-than-estimated
profits and the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase asset
purchases lifted stock prices. The equity benchmark has fallen
3.1 percent since reaching a two-year high on Nov. 5 on
speculation China will raise interest rates to tame inflation
and amid concern the sovereign-debt crisis will spread to
southern Europe.  Global stocks have dropped for three straight weeks,
pushing the  MSCI World Index  down 5.1 percent since Nov. 5.
Spanish and Portuguese bonds dropped while the euro slumped to
the lowest levels in more than two months against the dollar.  Ireland, swamped by the bursting of a decade-long real-
estate bubble and unemployment approaching 14 percent, became
the second country to tap European assistance. The government
said it will pay average interest of 5.8 percent on the package,
which breaks down to 45 billion euros ($60 billion) from
European governments, 22.5 billion euros from the International
Monetary Fund and 17.5 billion euros from Ireland’s cash
reserves and national pension fund.  ‘Big Elephant’  Spain is the “big elephant” in the European debt crisis
because there may not be enough money to bail out the Iberian
nation, said Nouriel Roubini , chairman of Roubini Global
Economics who predicted the global economic slump of 2008. “It
is quite likely that Portugal” is the next in line for financial
assistance, Roubini said today in Prague at a conference of
chief executive officers sponsored by ING Groep NV.  The S&P 500’s decline today sent the index as low as
1,173.64, below its 50-day  moving average  of 1,177 for the first
time since September, Bloomberg data show. Technical analysts
who base investment decisions on price charts say retreats below
such levels often lead to faster declines.  Hewlett-Packard  had the biggest decline in the Dow, falling
1.4 percent to $42.60. The world’s biggest computer maker was
sued by shareholders seeking information about the company’s
ouster of former Chief Executive Officer  Mark Hurd .  Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company, lost 1
percent to $31.90. Home Depot Inc., the largest U.S. home-
improvement retailer, decreased 1 percent to $30.69.  Payment Networks  Visa retreated 1.7 percent to $74.19. The biggest payments
networks face the threat of losing market share to companies
that offer mobile payments at point of sale, Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. analyst  Rod Bourgeois  wrote in a note today.  Starbucks Corp. declined 1.1 percent to $30.79, while  Kraft
Foods Inc.  slipped 0.4 percent to $30.19. Kraft said it
initiated an arbitration proceeding over a pact to distribute
coffee to grocery stores. Since the companies began working
together, Starbucks’ retail-grocery coffee business has grown
from $50 million to $500 million in annual revenue, Kraft said.
Starbucks said Kraft didn’t meet its responsibilities to
“protect and promote” its brands.  A measure of  retailers  fell even after the National Retail
Federation reported a 6.4 percent increase in retail sales over
the weekend. About 212 million shoppers went to stores and
websites over the holiday weekend, spending $365.34 on average.
The proportion of sales online rose to more than one-third of
the total, the highest ever.  ‘Very Strong’  “The retail space looks very strong,” said  Timothy Ghriskey,  chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management
in Bedford Hills, New York, which manages $2 billion.
“Certainly the data that we’ve seen looks very good in terms of
retail for the holiday season with the sales so far above
expectations.”  Macy’s Inc., the second-biggest U.S. department-store
chain, declined 2.2 percent to $25.42.  Amazon.com Inc. , the
largest online retailer, rose 1.3 percent to $179.49.  Banks had the biggest gain among 24 groups in the S&P 500.
 Wells Fargo  jumped 2.1 percent to $27.20 as RBC Capital Markets
said it expects the largest U.S. home lender to be among the
first allowed by regulators to increase payouts early next year.
Bank of America added 1.7 percent to $11.31. Huntington
Bancshares Inc. gained 4.3 percent to $5.79.  FedEx Corp.  rose the most in the S&P 500, rallying 4.7
percent to $91.59. The second-largest U.S. package-shipping
company was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Credit
Suisse Group AG. The share-price estimate is $111.  To contact the reporters on this story:
