Marubeni Corp., a Japanese trading
company, expects to expand grain shipments to 25 million tons by
2013 from an expeted 20 million tons this year, the Financial
Times reported, citing an interview with Marubeni Chief
Executive Officer Teruo Asada. It’s the world’s sixth-largest
grain trader after almost doubling volume over the last five
years, and plans to expand into related businesses such as
milling and animal feed processing, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
