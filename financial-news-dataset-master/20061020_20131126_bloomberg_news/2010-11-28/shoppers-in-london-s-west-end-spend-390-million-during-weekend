Retailers in central London reported
sales of over 250 million pounds ($390 million) this weekend,
with toys and electrical and fashion goods among the most
popular purchases.  Over one million shoppers descended on the U.K. capital’s
West End, where many stores reported a more than 10 percent
increase in sales of so-called “big ticket items,” such as
high-definition televisions, according to the  New West End Co. ,
the organization that represents retailers in central London’s
main shopping district, including  Oxford Street .  “Retailers are reporting that average transaction size was
up this weekend,” New West End Chief Executive Officer Richard
Dickinson said in a statement today. “Shoppers spent an average
of 200 pounds each this weekend, compared with 120 pounds the
same weekend last year.”  Separately, U.K. retailer John Lewis Partnership Plc said
its weekly sales rose 8.7 percent from the year-ago period,
driven by gifts for children.  Sales were 99.94 million pounds in the week to Nov. 27,
London-based John Lewis company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The figure is a 13.5 percent increase from the previous
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
