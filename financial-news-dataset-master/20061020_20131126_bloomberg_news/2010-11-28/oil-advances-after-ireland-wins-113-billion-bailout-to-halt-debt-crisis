Oil traded at the highest price in
two weeks on speculation cold weather in Europe will increase
fuel demand.  Futures rose as much as 1.5 percent as traders bet
subfreezing temperatures and forecasts of snow throughout Europe
will boost consumption of motor and heating fuel. Oil trimmed
gains as the euro declined after European governments and the
International Monetary Fund extended an aid package to Ireland.  “We’re having the coldest November in 25 or 30 years, so
people are burning more oil,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior
broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London.  Oil for January delivery climbed as much as $1.27 to $85.03
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest intraday price since Nov. 15. It was at
$84.66 at 1:49 p.m. London time. Brent crude for January
settlement rose as much as $1.14, or 1.3 percent, to $86.72 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Temperatures in Paris will be as low as minus 5 degrees
Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with an
average minimum of plus 4 for this time of year, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. London temperatures may
decline to minus 6 on Dec. 3, according to CustomWeather.  EU Bailout  The EU handed an 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) bailout to
Ireland and told Greece it could have an extra four-and-a-half
years to repay emergency loans to match the seven-year term
under Ireland’s deal. The euro fell as low as $1.3136, the
weakest rate against the dollar since Sept. 21.  “When you have sovereign risk concerns mounting on euro-
zone member countries, the euro comes under pressure relative to
the dollar,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity
markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA. “As oil trades inversely
with the dollar, a potential for the euro to regain some ground
relative to the dollar will be positive for oil prices.”  Traders are increasing bets that oil will reach $100 next
year on signs of falling inventories and a reduction in spare
output capacity.  The price of options to buy December 2011 futures at $100 a
barrel jumped 14 percent on Nov. 24, the largest one-day gain in
three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So-called
 open interest  for the contract has risen 51 percent this year to
45,424 lots, the highest for any crude option on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  The increase in trading of $100 options shows some
investors anticipate oil will rise at least 19 percent to levels
last reached in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
