Iran finished loading fuel into the
country’s first nuclear power reactor and aims to start up the
plant in the southern city of Bushehr by late January, the head
of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization said.  The water inside the reactor’s core needs to warm
gradually, and a series of tests has to be carried out,  Ali Akbar Salehi  said yesterday, according to state-run news channel
 Press TV .  “We hope the Bushehr power plant will hook up with the
national grid in one or two months,” Salehi said in a report
published on Press TV’s website.  Iran is restricted by international sanctions over its
nuclear program, which the U.S. and its allies say is cover for
the development of atomic weapons. Iran rejects the allegation
and says it needs nuclear technology to generate electricity and
for other civilian purposes such as medical research.  The country began transferring fuel to the reactor area of
the plant at a ceremony held on Aug. 21 to mark the opening of
the Russian-built facility. It started loading fuel into the
reactor in October. Under Iran’s agreement with Moscow-based
Rosatom, the state-owned Russian company will supply uranium for
the plant and take away spent fuel.  Iran, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, may save 11 million barrels of
crude or 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas a year by operating the
Bushehr reactor, according to the  London-based World Nuclear
Association.   To contact the reporter on this story:
