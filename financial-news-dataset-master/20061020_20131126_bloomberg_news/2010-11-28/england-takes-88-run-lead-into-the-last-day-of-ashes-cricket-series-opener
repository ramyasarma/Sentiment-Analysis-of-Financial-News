Alastair Cook  hit a career-best 235
and  Jonathan Trott  struck 135 as England set Australia 297 runs
for victory on the last day of the series-opening Ashes cricket
Test in Brisbane. The home team was 11-1 at the tea break.  Cook and Trott shared a record unbeaten partnership of 329
for England in Australia as the touring team amassed 517-1 in
its second innings. Captain  Andrew Strauss , who made 110
yesterday, declared to send Australia into bat for 41 overs.  Australian opener  Simon Katich  lasted 16 balls before
edging a  Stuart Broad  delivery to Strauss in the slips.  Shane Watson  was yet to score at the break, with home skipper  Ricky Ponting  on 6 at a ground where Australia last lost in 1988.  With 34 overs remaining, a draw is the most likely result
at odds of 1-50, according to U.K. bookmaker William Hill,
meaning a successful $50 wager would return $1 plus the original
stake. England is a 12-1 chance to force a victory in the final
session ahead of Australia at 200-1.  England’s top-order batsmen rallied to wrest control of the
game away from Australia over the past two days after the home
team had built a 221-run lead on the first innings. It’s the
first time England’s top three batsmen have made centuries in an
Ashes Test.  After putting on 188 runs for the opening wicket with
Strauss yesterday, Cook then shared an unbroken partnership with
Trott that beat the 323-run stand by Jack Hobbs and Wilfred
Rhodes at Melbourne in 1911-12.  Cook beat  Ian Botham ’s 138 as the highest score by an
Englishman at the Brisbane venue and then surpassed his biggest
Test score of 173 against Bangladesh in March. He brought up his
first double hundred in elite matches with a single to become
the fourth English batsmen to score 200 in Australia.  Record Partnership  Trott, who had resumed on 54, brought up a century against
Australia for the second straight match by hitting a three on
the leg side. Trott’s 119 on debut at The Oval in London 15
months ago had helped England win the 2009 Ashes series 2-1.  It’s the first time England’s top three made centuries in a
Test since 1924, when Hobbs, Herbert Sutcliffe and Frank Woolley
all reached triple figures against South Africa at Lord’s in
London.  Cook and Trott had advanced the score to 370-1 at the
morning drinks break after Trott had been dropped by  Michael Clarke  for the second time in his innings when on 75. Trott also
had a life on 34 yesterday.  England’s rally in its second innings came after centuries
by  Mike Hussey  and  Brad Haddin  lifted Australia to a 221-run
first-innings lead at a ground where it’s won 16 of its past 20
matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
