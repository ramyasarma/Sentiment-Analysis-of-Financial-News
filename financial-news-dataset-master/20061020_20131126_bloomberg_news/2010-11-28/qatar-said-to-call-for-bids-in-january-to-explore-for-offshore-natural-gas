  Qatar Petroleum , the state-run
energy company in the country with the world’s third-largest gas
reserves, is calling for bids for offshore exploration to be
submitted early in 2011, people familiar with the auction said.  Bids for rights to explore for gas off the coast of the
Persian Gulf state in an area called block A are due on Jan. 9,
said two of the people, who declined to be identified by name
because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter. Offers
are due in early January, a third person with knowledge of the
bidding procedure said.  An official for Qatar Petroleum said he didn’t know about
the deadline and could not immediately comment.  Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, plans to increase gas output to 23 billion cubic feet a day
by 2014 to boost exports and provide fuel for domestic
industries and power plants.  The country has offered exploration rights to three
companies over the past two years. A joint venture between  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc  and China National Petroleum Corp. signed a 30-
year exploration and production sharing agreement in May for an
area called block D.  Cnooc Ltd . of  Hong Kong  signed a 25-year
agreement with Qatar Petroleum in August 2009 to search for gas
in a separate offshore block.  Qatar expects by early next year to increase its annual
capacity for exporting liquefied natural gas to 77 million tons,
equivalent to about 3.75 trillion cubic feet of pipeline gas,
with the completion of its final planned liquefaction plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
