Pfizer Inc. received approval from
Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to sell its
painkiller Lyrica to treat peripheral neuropathic pain, the
company said in a Business Wire statement.  The drug is the first in Japan approved for treatment of
the disease. Pfizer jointly markets the medication with Japan’s
Eisai Co.  Patients with the condition often experience the sensation
of burning, tingle or shock-like feelings caused by a
dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system, Pfizer said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
