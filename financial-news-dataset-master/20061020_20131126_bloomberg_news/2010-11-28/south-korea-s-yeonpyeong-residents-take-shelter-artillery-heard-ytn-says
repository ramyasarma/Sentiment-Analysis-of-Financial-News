South Korea’s military ordered
residents of Yeonpyeong island to bomb shelters today and an
artillery shot was heard on the North Korean mainland, said a
defense ministry spokesman who declined to named, citing
government policy.  Residents of the border island off the west coast of the
Korean peninsula were told to take shelter at 11:18 a.m., the
spokesman said. He declined to say if the artillery shot was
the reason for the order.  Broadcaster YTN said a siren and instructions via
loudspeakers warning people to take shelter were heard this
morning, citing a reporter on the island.  Four people were killed, including two civilians, when
North Korea shelled the island on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
