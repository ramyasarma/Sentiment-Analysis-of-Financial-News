Japan’s retail sales declined for
the first time this year after a stimulus program ended and the
tobacco tax was increased.  Sales  decreased 0.2 percent in October from a year earlier,
the Trade Ministry said today in Tokyo. The median estimate of
11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 0.7 percent
gain. From a month earlier, they tumbled 1.9 percent.  Today’s report confirms that consumers are cutting back as
the boost government subsidies and an impending tobacco tax
increase gave the economy in the third quarter fades. The job
market hasn’t improved enough to help increase demand this
quarter, according to economist  Yoshiki Shinke .  “The underlying trend of consumer spending isn’t
deteriorating, but it’s clear spending is going to stay weak
until the end of this year,” Shinke, senior economist at Dai-
Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said before the report.  A government subsidy program for energy-efficient cars
ended in September, and a tax increase boosted the price of an
average pack of cigarettes by one third on Oct. 1. Consumers
rushed to buy vehicles and tobacco before they became more
expensive, helping the economy grow at a 3.9 percent annual pace
last quarter.  In a sign the yen’s strength and the end of the auto
program are damping sentiment, consumer confidence slid to a
seven-month low in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
