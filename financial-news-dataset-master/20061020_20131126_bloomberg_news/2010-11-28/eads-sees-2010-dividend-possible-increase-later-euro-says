European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  expects to propose a dividend payment for this year,  Euro am
Sonntag  reported, citing an interview with Chief Financial
Officer  Hans Peter Ring .  EADS sees “no problem” to increase the dividend at a later
stage if the company meets its growth targets, the newspaper
cited Ring as saying. The company sees a potential to sell as
many as 500 of its A400M military transport planes, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
