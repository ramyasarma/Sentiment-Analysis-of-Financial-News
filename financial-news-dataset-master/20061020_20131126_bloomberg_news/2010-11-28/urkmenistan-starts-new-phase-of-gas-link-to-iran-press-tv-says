Iran and Turkmenistan started today
the second phase of a $1.2 billion pipeline that will double
exports of Turkmen gas to the Persian Gulf country to 20 billion
cubic meters a year,  Press TV  said.  The opening ceremony, attended by Iranian president  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and his Turkmen counterpart Gurbanguly
Berdymukhammedov, took place earlier today in the border city of
Sarakhs in northern Iran, the state-run news channel said.  “Iran is ready for any cooperation with Turkmenistan,”
Ahmadinejad said in a speech at the ceremony, part of which was
shown live on Press TV.  Turkmenistan, holder of the world’s fourth-largest natural
gas reserves, opened a pipeline in January 2009 to deliver gas
to neighbouring Iran as the central Asian nation sought to
diversify markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
