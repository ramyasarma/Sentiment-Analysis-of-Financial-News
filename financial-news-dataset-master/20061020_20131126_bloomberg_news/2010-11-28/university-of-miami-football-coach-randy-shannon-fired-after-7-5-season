University of Miami football coach
 Randy Shannon  was fired last night after his team lost to the
University of South Florida 23-20 in overtime, ending the
college’s worst season at home since 1997.  “We have made a decision to seek new leadership for our
football program,” Miami Athletic Director  Kirby Hocutt  said on
the school’s website. “Our expectations are to compete for
championships and return to the top of the college football
world.”  The Hurricanes were 7-5 this season, and 3-3 at home.
Shannon, 44, who was 28-22 in four seasons, signed a four-year
extension before the start of the 2010 season that was said to
pay him $1.5 million a year, the Palm Beach Post reported.  Offensive line coach  Jeff Stoutland  may be named interim
coach, according to ESPN.  Hocutt said he would begin a national search immediately
for Shannon’s replacement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
