The Australian dollar rebounded from
the lowest level in almost eight weeks against the greenback as
European governments gave Ireland an 85 billion-euro ($113
billion) bailout, spurring demand for higher-yielding currencies.  The so-called Aussie gained against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts after European finance ministers agreed that a
future crisis-management system won’t automatically cut the
value of bond holdings. The New Zealand dollar rebounded from a
one-month low against the U.S. dollar as data showed the South
Pacific nation’s trade deficit shrank last month.  “The initial response by investors was positive” about
the bailout,  John Kyriakopoulos , head of currency strategy at
National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney, wrote in a research note.
“The consequent modest easing in risk aversion helped the
Australian dollar.”  Australia’s currency gained to 96.78 U.S. cents as of 9:54
a.m. in Sydney from 96.45 in New York on Nov. 26, when touched
96.13 cents, the weakest level since Oct. 5. The Aussie advanced
to 81.40 yen from 81.12 yen. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the
kiwi, rose to 75.23 U.S. cents from 74.99 cents. The kiwi was at
63.27 yen from 63.06 yen.  New Zealand’s trade deficit was NZ$319 million ($239
million) in October from a revised NZ$457 million in September,
Statistics New Zealand said today in Wellington. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists was for a
NZ$400 million deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
