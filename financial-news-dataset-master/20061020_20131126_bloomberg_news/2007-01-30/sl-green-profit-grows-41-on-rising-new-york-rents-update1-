             SL Green Realty Corp., (SLG)  New York's
biggest owner of office buildings, said fourth-quarter earnings
rose 41 percent, as rising  Manhattan  office rents boosted revenue.  
 Net income rose to $29.4 million, or 62 cents a share, from
$20.8 million, or 48 cents a share a year earlier, the New York-
based real estate investment trust said in a statement.  
 Rents for the highest-quality offices in Manhattan rose to a
record $68.29 a square foot in 2006, according to Colliers ABR, a
New York brokerage, a 34.8 percent jump over 2005. Vacancies fell
to a post-Sept. 11 low of 6 percent. Brokers expect similar
increases over the next two years, as the financial and law firms
that dominate the market keep expanding.  
 ``There were properties they purchased with high vacancy
rates, and they leased them up, so those high occupancy rates are
contributing to their growth,'' said Lou Taylor, a REIT analyst at
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., who has a ``buy'' rating on the
stock. ``And they got much higher rents on the leases that expired
in the last 12 to 18 months.''  
 The company reported funds from operations, a measure of  cash
flow  used by REITs, of $60.5 million, or $1.18 a share, up from
$46.9 million, or 1.02 cents a share a year ago. The results beat
the average estimate of $1.12 a share by 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Funds from operations don't comply with generally
accepted accounting standards.  
 Revenue was $159.5 million, 45 percent more than the $110.1
million the company made a year ago.  
 Reckson Acquisition  
 The report came four days after the company, whose founder and
chairman is Stephen L. Green, increased its property holdings with
the $4.5 billion purchase of Reckson Associates Realty Corp., which
closed on Jan. 25. The Reckson purchase gave them six  New York  City
skyscrapers.  
 SL Green sold most of the suburban properties it got in the
Reckson purchase for $2 billion to RexCorp Realty, a newly created
partnership led by Reckson Chief Executive Officer Scott Rechler.  
 The acquisition of Reckson, which added such midtown
skyscrapers as 919 Third Avenue and 1350 Avenue of the Americas to
its roster, should help SL Green's profitability this year, Taylor
said. He said he is expecting the company to sell less profitable
buildings as it absorbs the Reckson assets.  
 ``The earnings accretion they're going to explain will cause
people to realize there's more room to grow here,'' he said in an
interview conducted before the earnings were released.  
 485 Lexington  
 In December, the company leased 55,000 square feet in 485
Lexington Avenue, a tower adjacent to Grand Central Terminal, then
followed that up this month with a 13,700-square-foot lease to the
law firm Grand & Eisenhofer PA, bringing the building occupancy to
more than 90 percent. SL Green paid $225 million to insurer TIAA-
CREF in 2004 for the 32-story, 926,000 square-foot building. The
insurer vacated almost the entire building in 2005.  
 In a separate release, SL Green said it obtained a 10-year
interest-only mortgage on 485 Lexington for $450 million, at a
5.56 percent interest rate.  
 Vacancies in SL Green's portfolio fell to 3 percent, from 3.9
percent last quarter and 4 percent a year ago. Starting rents for
leases signed in the quarter were $61.99, a 28.7 percent increase
over the previous rents.  
 Results were issued after the close of regular U.S. trading.
SL Green shares fell $1.14 to $146.87 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. They gained 74 percent in 2006, making them the
top performer in the 138-member Bloomberg REIT index, which gained
28 percent.  
 (SL Green scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 2 p.m.
New York time. The call can be monitored at +1-866-203-3436 in the
