             News Corp. (NWS) 's Fox Filmed
Entertainment named Hutch Parker vice chairman of the Twentieth
Century Fox Film Group, giving him responsibility for the
studio's animation business.  
 Parker has been president of the Twentieth Century Fox Film
Group since 2005 and led production prior to that, Los Angeles-based Fox Film Entertainment said today in a statement.  
 The promotion gives Parker responsibility for a unit that
produced films including the two ``Ice Age'' films, which have
taken in $1.03 billion. Fox is reorganizing its animation unit
after the departure last week of its president, Chris Meledandri,
who left for a similar post at Universal Pictures.  
 Parker has helped produce live-action films including the
three ``X-Men'' movies and the Ben Stiller comedy ``Night at the
Museum,'' which has taken in $391.8 million in worldwide box-office sales in six weeks of release, according to industry
tracker Box Office Mojo LLC.  
 Vanessa Morrison was named president of Fox Animation and
will report to Parker, the company said. Morrison's film credits
include ``Garfield,'' ``Dr. Doolittle'' and the ``Cheaper by the
Dozen'' films.  
 Class A shares of  News Corp. (NWSA)  fell 8 cents to $22.82 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They have gained 45
percent in the last year.
