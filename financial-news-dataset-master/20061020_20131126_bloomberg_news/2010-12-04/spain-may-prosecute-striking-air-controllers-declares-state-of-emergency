The Spanish government declared the
first state of emergency in 32 years of democracy and threatened
to prosecute striking air traffic controllers who have crippled
aviation in the nation unless they return to work.  More than 2,800 flights have been canceled since the
wildcat strike began about 5 p.m. yesterday.  Iberia Lineas
Aereas de Espana SA , Spain’s largest airline, canceled all of
its flights until 6 a.m. tomorrow.  British Airways Plc  was among
carriers that canceled or delayed flights to and from Spain.  “The controllers who are on strike will be informed in
writing of their responsibilities,” Deputy Prime Minister
 Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  said in a televised press conference in
Madrid today. “Those who continue to disobey orders will face
prosecution.”  The Spanish military is being deployed to take over the
positions of hundreds of air-traffic controllers who are staging
an unofficial walk after wrangling with the government since
January when authorities took steps to cut their average annual
pay by 40 percent.  Controllers were paid an average 334,000 euros ($450,000)
in 2008, with 28 of them earning more than 700,000 euros,
Industry Minister  Jose Blanco  told Spain’s parliament in
January. The wages are the highest in Europe, according to
Blanco.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
