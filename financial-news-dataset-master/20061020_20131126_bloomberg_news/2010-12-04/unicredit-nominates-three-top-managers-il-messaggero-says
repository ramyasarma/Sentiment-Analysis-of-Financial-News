UniCredit SpA has identified three
executives to take over top management positions left vacant in
a reshuffle after the resignation of Chief Executive Officer
 Alessandro Profumo  in September, Il Messaggero reported without
saying where it got the information.  Frederik Geertman, currently the head of marketing for
retail banking, will lead the lender’s family and small
business unit, replacing  Roberto Nicastro , who was named
 general manager  under new CEO  Federico Ghizzoni , the newspaper
said. Alessandro Decio, head of the bank’s Turkish business,
will take over UniCredit’s interests in central and eastern
Europe, and Paolo Cornetta will lead human resources,
Messaggero said.  UniCredit officials have not yet agreed who will run the
corporate and investment banking businesses, the last of the
top posts still vacant, the newspaper said.  All the nominations will be made public when the bank
announces its five-year business plan on Dec. 14, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
