Saudi Arabian shares, led by
petrochemicals, rose the most in almost a month after U.S. and
European stocks rallied and oil prices surged to a 25-month high
on a weaker dollar.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, and  National Industrialization Co. , the
petrochemical producer known as Tasnee, paced the advance. The
146-company  Tadawul All Share Index  rose 1.2 percent, the most
since Nov. 6, to 6,421.86, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.  “It is not surprising to see a strong opening in the Saudi
market especially in the petrochemical sector, given the strong
performance of the international markets in equities and oil
reaching close to the $90” level, said  Fuad Aghabi , investment
director at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh.  U.S., European and emerging-market stocks rose this week
amid improved U.S. economic data and efforts by the European
Central Bank to stem the region’s debt crisis.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 3 percent in the
five days to yesterday, its largest gain in four weeks. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average rallied 2.6 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 1.6 percent this week.
The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-nation
equities, advanced 3.8 percent.  Crude oil rose to the highest level in 25 months, with oil
for January delivery settling at $89.19 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Futures increased 6.5 percent
this week and 12 percent this year. Saudi Arabia holds one-fifth
of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Payrolls  “Payroll data in the U.S. was definitely disappointing,
but overall recent economic data released from developed markets
have been better,” Rahmatullah Khan, an economist at Al Rajhi
Capital, said in Riyadh. U.S. payrolls increased 39,000, after a
revised 172,000 increase the prior month, Labor Department
figures showed yesterday in Washington.  Sabic  rose 2.2 percent to 104 riyals, the highest since
Nov. 6.  Tasnee  climbed 6.3 percent to 33.9 riyals, the highest
since Sept. 10, 2008, and  Saudi Industrial Investment Group 
gained 4.4, the most in almost more than two months, to 21.50
riyals.  Advanced Petrochemicals Co.  jumped 3.5 percent to 26.9
riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
