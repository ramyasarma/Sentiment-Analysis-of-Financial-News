Canada’s dollar advanced for the
first time in four weeks as evidence of a global economic
recovery helped crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, rally to
a two-year high.  The loonie trailed the currencies of fellow commodity
producers Australia and Norway this week as reports showed
Canada added fewer jobs in November than economists forecast and
the U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly rose. The Bank of Canada
will refrain from increasing borrowing costs Dec. 7, according
to all 12 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Demand for Canadian-dollar assets has driven much of the
recent strength,”  Shane Enright , executive director at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets in Toronto, wrote
via e-mail.  The Canadian currency appreciated 1.7 percent to C$1.0039
per U.S. dollar yesterday, from C$1.0213 on Nov. 26. It touched
C$1.0003 yesterday, the strongest level since Nov. 11. One
Canadian dollar buys 99.61 U.S. cents. The currency will weaken
to C$1.07 by the end of the second quarter, Enright said.  Norway’s krone advanced 3.4 percent to 5.9523 against the
dollar, while Australia’s dollar strengthened 3 percent to 99.31
U.S. cents.  The loonie will strengthen to a one-for-one basis against
the U.S. dollar by the end of March, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 30 economists. The
currency touched a level stronger than parity Nov. 5-11.  “Parity still feels like it will be sticky,” said CIBC’s
Enright. “Our data this week has hardly been stellar.”  Jobs Reports  The currencies of Canada and Mexico, which on average ship
about three-quarters of their exports to the U.S., were the only
major counterparts of the greenback not to rise yesterday after
jobs reports dimmed the outlook for interest-rate boosts.  Canadian employers added 15,200  jobs  in November after an
increase of 3,000 in the previous month, Statistics Canada said
yesterday. The median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a gain of 19,800. The unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped to 7.6 percent, from 7.9 percent.  U.S. payrolls expanded by 39,000, less than the most
pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
after a revised 172,000 advance in the prior month, Labor
Department figures showed. The jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent,
the highest since April.  The gross domestic product of Canada, the world’s 10th-
biggest economy, advanced at a less-than-forecast 1 percent
annualized third-quarter pace after revised gains of 2.3 percent
and 5.6 percent in the previous two quarters, Statistics Canada
said Nov. 30. The median estimate of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.5 percent gain.  Interest-Rate View  Traders pared bets on the prospect for an increase in
interest rates after the jobs reports. Yields on the March 2011
bankers’ acceptances contract, a gauge of expectations for
short-term borrowing costs, dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.45 percent.  So-called Bax contracts  average  about 20 basis points above
the central bank’s overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992
show. Hedge funds and money managers use the contracts to hedge
against interest-rate exposure and make bets.  The  Bank of Canada  held its target lending rate at 1
percent in October after three successive increases of a
quarter-percentage point beginning June 1, citing a weaker
economic outlook for the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner.  The yield on Canada’s two-year government  bonds  fell four
basis points to 1.63 percent this week after touching 1.72
percent two days ago, the highest level since Nov. 25. The price
of the 1.5 percent security maturing in December 2012 rose 8
cents to C$99.75.  U.S. Yield Spread  Two-year bonds yielded 117 basis points more than the
equivalent-maturity U.S. security yesterday. The yield  advantage 
has narrowed from 121 basis points on Nov. 25, which was the
biggest since January 2004.  Crude oil rallied this week as a report showed China’s
manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in seven months. Oil got
a boost as a drop in the greenback made commodities more
attractive as an alternative investment.  January futures on crude oil increased 6.5 percent to
$89.19 a barrel after touching $89.49, the highest level since
October 2008. Canada derives about half its export revenue from
raw materials including crude oil, copper, timber and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
