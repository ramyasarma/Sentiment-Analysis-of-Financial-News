South Africa and Mozambique want to
attract capital investment from Saudi Arabia as they try to
expand their economies and build infrastructure, officials from
both countries said today.  South Africa wants partners on projects with a
“significant capital base,” the country’s Economic Development
Minister  Ebrahim Patel  told reporters in Riyadh today. “We are
seeking to encourage investment in food processing sectors.”  African leaders and ministers, including those from Ghana,
Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia, are attending a
two-day summit in Riyadh. The meeting aims to improve trade
volumes between the Persian Gulf nations and Africa.  Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s largest economy, is
encouraging domestic food companies to invest in Africa and Asia
to reduce local grain production and conserve water. The Arab
world’s largest economy wants to stop domestic wheat production
by 2016.  Saudi Arabia could “do a lot to help us in farming” and
provide “where we lack in capital,” the country’s President
 Armando Guebuza  said today. “We need better infrastructure,
better roads and railways.”  Mozambique is seeking as much as $4 billion to develop a
railway system that will link its major ports to neighboring
countries and connect the north to the south, Transport and
Communication Minister  Paulo Zucula  said on Nov. 11. Rail lines
linking Zimbabwe to the port of Beira, and Malawi and Zambia
with Nacala will be upgraded, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
