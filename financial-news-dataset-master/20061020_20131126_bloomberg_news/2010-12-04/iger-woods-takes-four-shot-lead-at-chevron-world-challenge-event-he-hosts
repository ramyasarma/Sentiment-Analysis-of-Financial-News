Tiger Woods  tops the leaderboard by
four strokes going into the third round of the Chevron World
Challenge.  The world’s former No. 1 golfer yesterday shot a six-under
66 to put himself at 13-under 131 at Sherwood Country Club in
Thousand Oaks, California.  “There’s ten par-5s so far and I’ve played them 10-under,
so that’s pretty good,” Woods said. “(Today) is the same game
plan, just go out there and plot my way along and take care of
the par-5s.”  Yet to win in 2010, Woods had his best 36-hole start of the
year. Behind him is U.S. Open champion  Graeme McDowell  at nine-
under 135 and  Luke Donald  with an eight-under 136.  “I like this golf course,” McDowell said. “I love the
way the greens set up here, and you feel like you can make those
eight-, ten-footers, the greens are so pure here.”  Woods is a four-time winner at the Chevron World Challenge,
an unofficial event that has a top prize of $1.2 million and
features a field of 18 players selected from the top 50 in world
rankings.  Woods last won 13 months ago at the Australian Masters. His
281-week run as world No. 1 ended on Nov. 1, when  Lee Westwood 
replaced him atop the rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
