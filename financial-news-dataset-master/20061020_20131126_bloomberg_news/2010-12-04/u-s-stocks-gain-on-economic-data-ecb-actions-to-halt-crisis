U.S. stocks rose this week, sending
benchmark indexes to their biggest gains in a month, amid
improved economic data and efforts by the European Central Banks
to stem the region’s debt crisis.  Home Depot Inc. jumped 8 percent, the  biggest gain  in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, as construction spending and
existing home sales topped economists’ estimates. Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advanced at least 5.6
percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended financial
stocks. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. rose 16 percent, its biggest
weekly advance since July, after same-store sales surged.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 3 percent to
1,224.71 in the five days yesterday, its largest gain in four
weeks. The Dow rallied 290.09 points, or 2.6 percent, to
11,382.09. The 30-stock gauge had its biggest two-day rally
since July on Dec. 1-2, surging 3.2 percent.  “With Europe, it appeared some of the recent flare-up on
the continent was going to subside and markets reacted
positively,” said  Mark Luschini , chief investment strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees more than $50
billion in Philadelphia. “There are continued signs of
improvement but the economy isn’t yet completely out of the
woods. The market’s going to be subject to setbacks.”  The S&P 500 is up 20 percent from this year’s low in July
after companies reported higher-than-estimated earnings and the
Federal Reserve announced a second round of Treasury purchases
to suppress interest rates and stoke growth. Goldman Sachs’
investment strategist  David Kostin  said the S&P 500 may rise to
1,450 by the end of next year as the economic recovery
accelerates. Bank of America’s  David Bianco  raised his 12-month
target for the index to 1,400 from 1,350.  ECB Bailout  U.S. equities advanced as ECB policy makers kept the
benchmark interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and delayed
the bank’s exit from emergency liquidity measures as the debt
crisis threatens to engulf Portugal and Spain. Ireland on Nov.
28 became the second country to tap European assistance,
following Greece. It received a rescue package worth 85 billion
euros ($112 billion).  Home Depot , the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
rallied 8 percent to $33.48, its biggest weekly advance since
July 2009. The U.S. Commerce Department said construction
spending rose 0.7 in October, lifted by the biggest gain in
residential projects in six months. The median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3 percent drop.  Record Increase  Homebuilders advanced after a report said Americans signed
contracts to buy previously owned homes in October, sending the
index of pending home resales to a record 10 percent increase.
 Lennar Corp. , the third-largest U.S. homebuilder, gained 15
percent to $17.26, its biggest one-week rally in seven months.  The S&P 500 fell as much as 0.4 percent yesterday after the
Labor Department said the  unemployment rate  rose to 9.8 percent
from 9.6 percent. The benchmark index then rebounded with
commodity prices, ending the day with a 0.3 percent gain. The
report also said U.S. payrolls increased by 39,000 last month,
trailing the median economist projection in a Bloomberg News
survey for an increase of 150,000 jobs.  “There’s been a separation between the lack of health in
the labor markets and very positive conditions for corporate
balance sheets. That’s not surprising.” said  David Sowerby , a
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based money manager at Loomis Sayles
& Co., which oversees $150 billion. “Profits traditionally
rebound before labor markets do. If this were to persist for two
or three months and were combined with a drop in ISM
manufacturing, then investors would be more concerned.”  ISM Report  A Dec. 1 report showed the Institute for Supply
Management’s manufacturing index slipped to 56.6 in November
from 56.9 in October. Readings exceeding 50 signal expansion.  Financial shares jumped after Goldman Sachs said banks will
outperform the market next year because of “stronger economic
growth, an improved equity investing environment and a more
supportive interest rate environment.” Marshall & Ilsley Corp.
rallied 18 percent to $5.60 for the  biggest gain  in the S&P 500.
Bank of America rose 6.7 percent to $11.86 after three straight
weeks of declines. JPMorgan increased 5.6 percent to $39.61.  Abercrombie & Fitch had the second-biggest advance in the
S&P 500, climbing 16 percent to $56.15. The teen clothing
retailer said its sales at stores open at least one year surged
22 percent in November. Analysts, on average, expected a 6.4
percent increase, according to Retail Metrics Inc.  Kroger Co. , the U.S. supermarket chain that fell the most
in a year on Dec. 2 after lowering the top end of its full-year
profit forecast, slipped 8.5 percent $21.11, the biggest decline
in the S&P 500. Barclays Plc cut its recommendation to “equal
weight” from “overweight.”  The benchmark index for U.S. stock  options  fell the most
this week since May. The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index  is known, dropped 19 percent to 18.01.
The index, which measures the cost of using options to protect
against S&P 500 declines, slumped after jumping 23 percent last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
