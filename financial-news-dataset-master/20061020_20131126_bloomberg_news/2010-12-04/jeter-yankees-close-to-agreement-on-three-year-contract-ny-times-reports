The New York Yankees and Derek Jeter
are close to agreement on a three-yer contract that would pay
the shortstop $15 million to $17 million a year, the New York
Times reported on its website.  The contract will include a “creative hybrid-type option”
for a fourth year that is “not vesting and is highly unusual,”
the Times said, citing a Major League Baseball official briefed
on the negotiations.  Jeter, 36, the team’s captain, batted .270 with a .340 on-
base percentage in 2010, both the lowest in a season since he
became a full-time player in 1996. The 11-time All-Star just
completed a 10-year, $189 million contract.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
