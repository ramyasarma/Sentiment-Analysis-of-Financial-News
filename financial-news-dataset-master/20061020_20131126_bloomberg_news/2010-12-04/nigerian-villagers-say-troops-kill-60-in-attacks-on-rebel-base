More than 60 people died and 40 homes
were destroyed when Nigerian troops in pursuit of rebel fighters
attacked a community in the country’s oil-producing  Niger Delta ,
residents said.  Members of the Nigerian military’s Joint Task Force
attacked the town of Ayakoromor to the west of the southern
delta near the camps used by a wanted rebel known as John Togo
and his fighters, community spokesman Bernard Brialade told
reporters yesterday in Warri.  “Many of our people are displaced” and are hiding in the
forest, he said, while calling on the government to stop the
attack. Colonel Timothy Antigha, spokesman for the Nigerian
military, said no civilians were killed and people only fled the
town to hide in the forest following an exchange of fire between
the troops and the rebels.  The crackdown follows a recent surge of attacks by
militants in the region who are demanding a greater share of the
delta’s oil riches, after a period of relative calm when
thousands of fighters disarmed under a government amnesty plan.
Armed raids in the delta cut about 28 percent of Nigeria’s oil
exports between 2006 and 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
largest source of U.S. oil imports.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. , Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint
ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
that pump more than 90 percent of the West African nation’s oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
