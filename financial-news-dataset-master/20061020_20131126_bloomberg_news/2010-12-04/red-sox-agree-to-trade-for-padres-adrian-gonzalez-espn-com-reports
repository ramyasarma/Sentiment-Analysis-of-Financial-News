The Boston Red Sox have agreed in
principle to a trade for San Diego Padres first baseman Adrian
Gonzalez, ESPN reported on its website.  The Red Sox have received permission from Major League
Baseball to negotiate with Gonzalez on a new contract, ESPN
said, citing people in baseball it didn’t identify. The team has
already flown Gonzalez, who had surgery Oct. 20 on his right
shoulder, in for a physical, ESPN said.  Gonzalez, 28, batted .298 with 31 home runs and 101 runs
batted in last season. The Padres would receive three minor
leaguers -- pitcher Casey Kelly, first basebamm Anthony Rizzo
and outfielder Reymond Fuentes -- along with a player to be
named later, ESPN said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
