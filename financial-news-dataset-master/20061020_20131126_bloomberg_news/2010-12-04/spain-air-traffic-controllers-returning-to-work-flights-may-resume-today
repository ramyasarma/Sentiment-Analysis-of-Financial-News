Striking air traffic controllers in
Spain have begun to return to work following and unofficial
strike, a spokesman for Aeropuertos Espanoles & Navegacion Aerea
SA, said.  Of the 58 air sectors over Spain, 28 had already re-
opened, reopening half of Spain’s airspace, the spokesman, who
declined to be named citing company policy, said.   Flights have yet to resume but it is hoped that they be
allowed to take off after 7 p.m. local time, the spokesman
added.   To contact the reporter on this story:
