Google Inc.’s offer to buy daily-
deal site Groupon Inc. has been rejected by the Chicago-based
startup, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The proposed acquisition fell through amid hesitation on the
part of Groupon’s founders, said the person, who requested
anonymity because the talks are private.  Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company
doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation. Julie Mossler, a
Groupon spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
