More than 2,800 flights have been
cancelled after Spanish air space was closed yesterday as air-
traffic controllers abandoned their positions in protest over
changes in pay and working conditions, a spokesman for
Aeropuertos Espanoles & Navegacion Aerea SA, Spain’s state-owned
airport operator, said in a telephone interview.  Half of the nation’s air-traffic controllers have not
turned up for work and the remaining half that have are refusing
to man their positions, the spokesman, who declined to be named
citing company policy, added.    To contact the reporter on this story:
