Ghana should use future oil revenue
as collateral for infrastructure loans because the country
requires more financing to help build schools, roads and
hospitals, Vice President  John Mahama  said.  “We don’t have the luxury to wait for revenue to drip
annually,” Mahama told reporters today in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
at a conference. “You need some flexibility.”  The West African country plans to change a petroleum
revenue bill to allow it to use future income as collateral for
loans, Deputy Information Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa told
reporters in the capital, Accra, on Dec. 2.  Ghana, set to begin exporting oil this month, will see
reserves reach 5 billion barrels in the next five years as more
fields start production, Moses Asaga, a member of President John
Atta Mills’ ruling National Democratic Congress party, told
lawmakers in Accra, the capital, on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
