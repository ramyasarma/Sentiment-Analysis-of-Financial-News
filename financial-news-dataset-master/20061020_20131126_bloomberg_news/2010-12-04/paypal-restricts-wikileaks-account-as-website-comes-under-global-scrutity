PayPal Inc., the payment processor
owned by EBay Inc., cut access today to the whistle-blowing
website WikiLeaks.org for violating its  acceptable use policy .  PayPal suspended the account after the U.S. said WikiLeaks
activities were in  violation  of the law, a spokesman for the
company said. PayPal wasn’t contacted by any government agency
and took the action on its own, the spokesman said.  PayPal’s move marks a further crippling of WikiLeaks, which
is releasing about 250,000 classified diplomatic cables that the
U.S., France and the U.K. say could endanger lives. Amazon.com
Inc. dropped WikiLeaks from its website-hosting service this
week for breaching terms of service.  “PayPal has permanently restricted the account used by
WikiLeaks due to a violation of the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy,
which states that our payment service cannot be used for any
activities that encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct
others to engage in illegal activity,” PayPal said in a blog
posting. “We’ve notified the account holder of this action.”  WikiLeaks had an earlier run-in with PayPal in January,
when it was temporarily blocked. The payment processor cut the
organization’s access after it failed to respond to a request
for more information when fundraising efforts triggered an
influx of money. The flood of cash triggered automatic money-
laundering alerts, though the situation was resolved about a day
later, the spokesman said.  Terms of Service  Amazon, the Seattle-based online retailer and Web-hosting
service, said that WikiLeaks had violated its  terms of service 
by posting material it didn’t own and that it was potentially
“putting innocent people in jeopardy.”  WikiLeaks’ U.S. site was shut down after electronic attacks
threatened the stability of access to other websites, according
to  EveryDNS.net , the U.S. service that translates online
addresses to Internet protocol numbers.  Since it began releasing the cables on Nov. 28, WikiLeaks
also has faced so-called denial-of-service attacks, where
hackers attempt to overwhelm a website with repeated requests
for data.  The site moved its domain name to Switzerland, WikiLeaks
said yesterday in its  Twitter feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
