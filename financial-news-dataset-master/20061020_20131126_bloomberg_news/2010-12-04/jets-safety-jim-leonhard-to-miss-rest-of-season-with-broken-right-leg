New York Jets starting safety  Jim Leonhard  will miss the rest of the season after having surgery
for a broken right leg sustained in practice, Jets General
Manager  Mike Tannenbaum  said in a statement.  Leonhard, 28, was injured yesterday in a collision with
wide receiver  Patrick Turner  at the Jets’ practice facility in
Florham Park, New Jersey. His tibia was fractured, while his
knee, ankle and fibula weren’t injured, the team said.  Leonhard was placed on injured reserve Saturday morning
following surgery at Morristown Memorial Hospital by Dr. Ken
Montgomery, Dr. Andrew Willis and Dr. Pat Grob.  Leonhard is in his sixth year in the National Football
League and second with the Jets, who have allowed the third-
fewest yards in the league this season. He leads all Jets
defensive backs with 66 tackles and has one interception and one
fumble recovery through 11 games.  Brodney Pool , a six-year veteran, will probably start at
safety in Leonhard’s place, said team spokesman  Bruce Speight 
said.  The 9-2 Jets travel to Foxboro, Massachusetts, to play the
9-2 division-rival New England Patriots. The Jets beat the
Patriots 28-14 at New Meadowlands Stadium in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
