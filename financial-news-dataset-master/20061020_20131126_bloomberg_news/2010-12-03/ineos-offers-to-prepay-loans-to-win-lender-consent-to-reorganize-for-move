Ineos Group Holdings Plc, the U.K.’s
largest privately-held company, is offering to pay debt early if
lenders agree to it reorganizing its structure following its
move to Switzerland for tax purposes.  Ineos would pay a 25 basis-point fee due in May 2011 early
and prepay 100 million euros ($133 million) of senior loans,
spokesman  Richard Longden  said. The fee is being offered on
Ineos’s loan refinancing announced in March. Lenders have until
Dec. 16 to accept the proposal, he said.  Ineos plans to create two holding companies in Luxembourg
and another two in Switzerland on top of its operating entities,
Longden said. The company moved its headquarters to Rolle,
Switzerland from Lyndhurst, England last week, he said.  “There are very few places in the world that are as
creditor-friendly as the U.K.,” said  Stephen Mostyn-Williams ,
founder of leveraged finance consulting firm smwlaw.  Ineos estimates it could potentially generate about 450
million euros of tax savings between now and 2014 as a result of
the move to Switzerland, the company  said  on April 9. Its day-
to-day businesses both in the U.K. and elsewhere will remain
unaffected by the change of headquarters and tax residence.  Ineos, which has net debt of 7 billion euros, generates 70
percent of its sales outside the U.K., according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
