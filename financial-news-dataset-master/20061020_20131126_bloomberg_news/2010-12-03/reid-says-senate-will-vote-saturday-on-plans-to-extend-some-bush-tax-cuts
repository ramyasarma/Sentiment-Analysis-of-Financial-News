The U.S. Senate plans to vote Dec. 4
on two Democratic proposals to extend Bush-era income-tax cuts,
Majority Leader Harry Reid said tonight.  Reid of Nevada said he decided to schedule the votes after
a Republican senator objected to a plan to hold votes tomorrow
on two Democratic and two Republican tax-cut extension
proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
