Comcast Corp. , bidding to gain
control of NBC Universal Inc., extended its agreement for the
transaction with NBC parent General Electric Co. by 90 days as
the companies await regulatory approval.  The “master agreement” was extended to March 3 from Dec.
3, Comcast said in a regulatory filing today. The original deal,
struck a year ago, included the option of two 90-day extensions.  Comcast, the largest U.S. cable-television company, is
acquiring a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from  GE  by paying
$6.5 billion in cash and contributing cable channels worth $7.25
billion to a joint venture that will own the entertainment
company. Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is “still focused on
working with the agencies to receive regulatory approval by year
end,” Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail today.  Comcast fell 1 cent to $20.71 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The  shares  have risen 23 percent
this year. GE, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, rose 10 cents to
$16.78 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
