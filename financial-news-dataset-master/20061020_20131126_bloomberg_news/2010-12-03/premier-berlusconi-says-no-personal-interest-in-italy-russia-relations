Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said
he along with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and
President Dmitry Medvedev had “no personal interests’ in the
growing commercial ties between the two countries.  Berlusconi was responding to comments contained in U.S.
diplomatic dispatches released by Wikileaks where U.S. officials
refer to the possibility that Berlusconi was earning a cut from
some of Italy’s energy agreements with Russia. He made the
comments at a press conference with Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev in Sochi, Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
