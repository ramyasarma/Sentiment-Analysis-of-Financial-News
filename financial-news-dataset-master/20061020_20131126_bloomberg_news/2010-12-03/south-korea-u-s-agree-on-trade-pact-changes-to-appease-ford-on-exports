The U.S. and South Korea reached an
agreement to change automobile provisions in a pending trade
deal, seeking to meet the demands of Ford Motor Co. and
lawmakers.  Both countries will scale back the initial tariff cuts for
automobiles, and South Korea said it would allow more imports of
U.S.-made vehicles that meet American standards and not Korean
rules, according to fact sheets released today by the White
House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
