Georgian Railway Construction Ltd., a
unit of Georgian Railway LLC, is considering selling shares in
an initial public offering to raise funds for a $500 million
hydropower plant, a company director said.  “The IPO is needed to attract investments and funding for
the project, which won’t be just a seasonal producer of
energy,” Archil Giorgadze, the director, said today in an
interview in Tbilisi. The state-owned company is in talks with
JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Group Plc and UBS AG on a possible
share sale and feasibility studies, he said.  The railway services provider plans to build a 400-megawatt
plant on the Enguri River in the western Svaneti area, he said,
adding that construction would start before 2012.  President  Mikheil Saakashvili  said on Nov. 8 that Georgia
may receive as much as $5 billion of investments in hydropower
projects over the next seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
