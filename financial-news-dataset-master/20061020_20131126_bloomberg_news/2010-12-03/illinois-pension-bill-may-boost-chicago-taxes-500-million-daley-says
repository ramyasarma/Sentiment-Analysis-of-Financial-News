Chicago may face the biggest property
tax increase in its history, according to Mayor  Richard M. Daley , under a bill passed by Illinois lawmakers requiring
greater contributions to police and firefighter pension systems.  The third most-populous U.S. city may need to boost real-
estates taxes by more than $500 million a year, Daley has said.
The plan, which the Democratic mayor opposed, would apply to all
new public safety hires in Illinois.  The bill approved today by the state Senate was sent to
Governor Pat Quinn for signature. Kelly Kraft, a spokeswoman for
Quinn, a Democrat, didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment.  The longest recession since the 1930s reduced Chicago’s
revenue by more than $1 billion, forcing the city to dip into
reserves and cut spending on a 2011 budget of $6.15 billion.  Standard & Poor’s cut Chicago’s credit rating on Nov. 5 by
one level to A+, the fifth-highest investment grade, citing the
city’s reliance on cash reserves to balance its budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
