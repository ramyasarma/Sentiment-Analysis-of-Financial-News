The Maritime Union of Australia said
concerns that worker safety is inadequate at  Chevron Corp.’s 
A$43 billion ($42 billion) Gorgon gas project may halt
construction if the issue isn’t resolved.  The union wants a “safety audit” of contractor Royal
Boskalis Westminster NV’s cranes and equipment at the site off
Australia’s northwest coast, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. The organization represents about 12,000 Australian
workers, according to its website.  Chevron and partners  Exxon Mobil Corp.  and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc agreed last year to proceed with the Gorgon liquefied
natural gas venture, Australia’s largest resources investment,
to gain from increasing Asian demand for the fuel. Gorgon is
among Australian resources developments competing for workers as
a looming skills shortage confronts the industry.  “It’s not about money -- it’s about safety concerns around
high-risk work and high-risk machinery,” Chris Cain, the
union’s Western Australia secretary, said by phone today.  Nicole Hodgson , a Chevron spokeswoman in Perth, and  Guy Houston , a company spokesman also based in Perth, didn’t
immediately return phone calls seeking comment.  Labor disputes in Western Australia have disrupted
construction of the A$14 billion Pluto LNG project operated by
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , the country’s second-largest oil and
gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
