Korean Air Lines Co. ’s fleet of
 Airbus SAS  A380 superjumbos will have the lowest seating density
of any operator to date as the Asian carrier seeks to lure top-
end travelers on inter-continental routes.  The planes will be fitted with 400 to 450 seats, leaving
space for “plenty of snazzy features,” spokesman James
Sanderson said in London. He declined to provide details, beyond
saying that the design includes lounges for premium passengers.  Qantas Airways Ltd. has the lowest-density layout among the
five carriers that currently operate the superjumbo, with 450
seats, though the Australian company’s next batch will have
either a smaller first-class cabin and 490 seats or none at all,
boosting capacity to 550 people. Air France’s planes have the
most berths at 538, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG offers 526,
Dubai-based Emirates 489 and  Singapore Airlines Ltd.  471.  Korean Air will take delivery of five superjumbos next year,
Sanderson said in the interview, adding that the total has been
confirmed by Airbus. Five more planes will follow over the next
two years. Most routes will be across the Pacific, he said.  The Seoul-based company was initially scheduled to receive
the A380 from 2008 before Airbus suffered a succession of
production delays.  Tokyo-based Skymark Airlines Inc. has said it intends to
operate A380s with 394 seats, including 114 in business class.
The carrier expects to receive its first superjumbo in 2014,
President  Shinichi Nishikubo  said last month.  ‘Real Luxury’  Korean Air plans to become a “real luxury carrier,”
deriving 50 percent of passenger sales from premium classes by
2019 as it challenges Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd., President  Chi Chang Hoon  said July 20.  Business and first-class cabins accounted for about 20
percent of passenger revenue last year.  Airbus will take delivery of one of the engines for the
first Korean Air A380 on Dec. 7. Handover of the aircraft is due
in May. The GP7200 turbine is the 100th to be shipped by the
Engine Alliance of  General Electric Co.  and Pratt & Whitney,
which competes with Rolls-Royce Group Plc to power the
superjumbo.  Australia’s aviation regulator has asked U.K.-based Rolls
to address “critical safety issues” with its Trent 900 model
after one of its engines blew up last month on a Qantas A380.  To contact the reporter on this story:
