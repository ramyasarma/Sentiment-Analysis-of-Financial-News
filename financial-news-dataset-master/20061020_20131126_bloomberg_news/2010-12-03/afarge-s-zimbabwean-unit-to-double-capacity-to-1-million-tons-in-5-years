Lafarge SA’s  Zimbabwean unit will
more than double its cement plant production capacity to 1
million metric tons over the next five years, Chief Executive
Officer  Bruno Lafont  said.  “Africa is a very important area of growth for Lafarge and
Zimbabwe is very important in that context,” Lafont told
reporters today in Harare, the capital. “We need to increase
capacity in Zimbabwe to 1 million tons in the next five years,”
he said, declining to add how much the project would cost as
Lafarge was still conducting feasibility studies.  The company, which owns 76 percent of  Lafarge Cement
Zimbabwe Ltd. , is in talks with the government over an
empowerment law which seeks to transfer 51 percent shareholding
in foreign-owned companies to black Zimbabweans.  The framework of the empowerment “regulations is very
important for our decision-making,” he said. “My first
reaction is to remain positive in terms of how we view the
country. Yes, there are regulations, but I think they are under
review and our team is engaged in discussions.”  The company invested $15 million to renovate the plant
during the current financial year, he said. Lafarge’s Zimbabwean
unit is the country’s second-largest cement producer, after
South Africa’s  Pretoria Portland Cement Co.   To contact the report on this story:
