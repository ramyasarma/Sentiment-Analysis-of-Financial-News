New York Jets starting safety  Jim Leonhard  was undergoing surgery tonight to repair a fractured
right leg he sustained in practice, the team said.  Leonard, 28, broke his leg during a collision with wide
receiver  Patrick Turner  at the Jets’ practice facility in
Florham Park, New Jersey, Speight said in a telephone interview.
The tibia was fractured; the knee, ankle and fibula weren’t
injured, he said.  A decision on his status with the team will be made
following the surgery at Morristown Memorial Hospital by Dr. Ken
Montgomery, Dr. Andrew Willis and Dr. Pat Grob, Speight said.  The team said he would miss the Dec. 6 game against the New
England Patriots.  Leonhard is in his sixth year in the National Football
League and second with the Jets, who have allowed the third-
fewest yards in the league this season. He has 61 tackles and
one interception through 11 games.  Brodney Pool , a six-year veteran, most likely will start at
safety in Leonhard’s place, Speight said.  The 9-2 Jets travel to Foxboro, Massachusetts, to play the
9-2 division-rival New England Patriots. The Jets beat the
Patriots 28-14 at New Meadowlands Stadium in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
