European premium  gasoline  advanced to
the highest price in more than two years as Total SA bought lots
on the barge market.  Low-sulfur fuel oil’s  premium  to high-sulfur fuel widened
for the first time in three days.  Dow Chemical Co.  sold a
naphtha cargo to Trafigura Beheer BV.  Light Products  Trafigura bought a 12,500-ton naphtha cargo at $841 a ton
for delivery to Rotterdam from Dec. 22 to Dec. 26, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. Naphtha cargoes changed hands yesterday at $838
and $842 a ton.  Premium unleaded  95-octane grade climbed to $839 a ton, the
survey showed. That’s the highest price since Oct. 1, 2008.
Premium barge deals were from $831 and $836.50 a ton yesterday.  Eurobob grade gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $826 to $838 a metric
ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. That compares
with deals yesterday from $816 to $831 a ton.  BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Morgan Stanley were among today’s
sellers. Ethanol is added to Eurobob to make finished fuel.  The barge market is for loads of no more than 5,000 tons.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December delivery increased 2.4 percent to
$768.75 a ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe as of 5:47 p.m.
local time. The gasoil crack, a measure of refining profit,
widened to $12.34 a barrel, ICE data show. A crack spread is the
difference between oil products and Brent crude.  Diesel barges advanced relative to December ICE gasoil.
Deals were done at a premium of $23 and $24 to the gasoil
contract, more than yesterday’s range from $22 to $23, the
survey showed.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil’s  premium  to the high-sulfur grade
widened to $9. That compares with $6 yesterday for the shipping
fuel, the lowest since Feb. 25.  Fuel oil’s discount to gasoil will widen as demand for
diesel pushes refiners to raise processing rates, leading to an
increase in residue supply, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  “On the expectation that gasoil demand growth rates will
continue to rise steadily and as higher refinery runs responding
to gasoil strength results in higher fuel oil supply, we are
likely to see a continuation of a rising light-heavy spread,”
 Soozhana Choi , Singapore-based Asia head of commodities
research, wrote in a research report today.  Refinery News  Reliance Industries Ltd. plans to halt two fluid catalytic
crackers at its refinery in Jamnagar, India, in early February
for about a month for maintenance, ICIS reported today citing a
person it didn’t identify. The gasoline-producing units have a
total capacity of 400,000 barrels of oil a day, ICIS said.  Manoj Warrier , a Reliance spokesman, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
