Level 3 Communications Inc. said
Comcast Corp. is trying to protect its cable-television business
by charging Level 3 for delivering movies and other video
content to its customers.  “Online distribution of movies, TV shows and other content
threatens Comcast’s traditional ‘closed’ video distribution
model,” the company said.  Level 3, which provides broadband services to customers
including Netflix Inc., made the statement in a 19-point public
letter issued today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
