Natural gas futures fell in New York,
heading for the first weekly decline in three weeks, on
speculation that supplies will be sufficient to meet winter
heating demand.  Gas futures slipped as inventories are 10 percent above the
five-year average for the week ended Nov. 26. The surplus of gas
in storage over the five-year average has risen in eight of the
past 10 weeks.  “The fundamental picture remains really weak,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “We’re near 3.8 trillion cubic feet of
gas and the production numbers are very robust.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.322 per million British thermal units at 9:08
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have
dropped 1.3 percent this week and 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
