 A unit of  Alstom SA , the world’s
third-largest power-equipment maker, is funding a joint research
effort by  Codexis Inc.  and  CO2 Solution Inc.  to develop
technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired
power plants.  Codexis, a Redwood City, California-based producer of
enzymes used to make biofuels and pharmaceuticals, announced the
16-month partnership in a  filing .  CO2 Solution said today in a statement that it had
completed “validation efforts” for the enzyme with Codexis in
the first half of this year.  Codexis did not say how much financial backing it would
receive from Alstom Power Inc. Alstom can extend or cancel the
agreement if certain conditions are met.  Quebec City, Quebec-based CO2 Solution said it would
receive as much as $3.4 million under the partnership from “a
global leader in energy and infrastructure projects.” Its
statement did not name Alstom.  The companies will focus on processes using carbonic
anhydrase enzymes, which have the potential to increase the
efficiency and “significantly decrease” the cost of capturing
carbon from flue gases at power plants, CO2 Solution said.  Codexis and CO2 Solution announced a technology partnership
in December 2009. As part of that agreement, Codexis paid C$2
million ($1.99 million) for a 16.6 percent stake in the company.  Codexis has fallen 24 percent through yesterday since its
initial public offering on April 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
