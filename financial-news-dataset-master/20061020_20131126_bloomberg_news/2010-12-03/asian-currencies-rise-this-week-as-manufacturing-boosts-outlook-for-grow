Asian currencies advanced this week,
led by the biggest five-day gain in South Korea’s won in two
months, as reports on manufacturing signaled regional growth.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  strengthened 1.1
percent for the week to 115.30. South Korea’s won appreciated
1.9 percent to 1,138.55, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. India’s rupee climbed 1.6 percent to 45.1060 and the
Singapore dollar added 1.1 percent to S$1.3059.  Expansion in factory production accelerated in China, South
Korea, Taiwan and Singapore over the past two months, official
data showed this week, bolstering the outlook for Asian
exporters. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the
region’s economies will expand at a faster pace than developed
nations this year.  “Some good data support risk appetite,” said  Minori Uchida , senior analyst in Tokyo at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. “Asian growth is solid and currencies will continue to
strengthen, but probably at a slower pace than this year.”  Overseas investors bought more stocks than they sold in
South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand this week and were net buyers
in India in the first three days of the week, exchange data
show. The IMF predicts Asia’s developing economies will expand
9.4 percent in 2010, compared with 2.7 percent in advanced
countries.  Korea Tensions  The won rose for a third day yesterday as investor concern
over tensions on the Korean peninsula eased and U.S. data
boosted optimism that the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  South Korea’s currency has rebounded 3 percent since
reaching a two-month low of 1,172.50 on Nov. 24, the day after
the North attacked an island in the South using artillery,
killing four people and prompting retaliatory fire.  South Korea’s military said on Dec. 2 it is preparing to
carry out live-fire artillery drills along its disputed western
sea border on Dec. 6. North Korea has increased the number of
multiple rocket launchers in its armed forces, bolstering its
capability to attack Seoul, Yonhap News reported yesterday,
citing a South Korean official it didn’t identify.  “We saw risk aversion rising in the early part of the
week,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in Singapore. “But things were better by the
second half of the week with the positive data from the U.S. and
China.”  Manufacturing Reports  A report on Dec. 2 showed Singapore’s Purchasing Managers’
Index climbed to 51.4 in November from 50.7 in October, the
highest level since July, while China’s logistics federation
said on Dec. 1 its index rose to 55.2 from 54.7 in October. ADP
Employer Services reported this week that U.S. companies took on
93,000 workers last month, the most since November 2007. Data
from the Institute for Supply Management showed manufacturing
expanded for a 16th month.  India’s rupee rose this week by the most since the five-day
period ended Oct. 1 on speculation Asia’s second-fastest growing
major economy will draw investors to new share offerings by
local companies.  Shipping Corp. of India Ltd., the country’s biggest sea
carrier, and the government may raise $240 million in a share
offering that opened on Nov. 30, Chairman S. Hajara said Nov.
26. A sale by MOIL Ltd., India’s largest producer of manganese
ore, closed on Dec. 1 with bids for 56 times the 33.6 million
shares offered, according to the National Stock Exchange.  “Share sales are boosting the rupee,” said  Naveen Raghuvanshi , a currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd.
in Mumbai. “I see the rupee holding around 45 to the dollar.”  Elsewhere this week, the Philippine peso advanced 0.8
percent to 43.895 per dollar and the Thai baht gained 0.5
percent to 30.05. The yuan climbed 0.1 percent to 6.6633 and
Taiwan’s dollar added 0.3 percent to NT$30.745. Indonesia’s
rupiah was little changed from Nov. 26 at 9,009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
