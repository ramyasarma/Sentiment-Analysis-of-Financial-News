Temasek Holdings Pte  and State Grid
Corp. of China will buy a combined $110 million of shares in the
initial public offering of China Huaneng Group Corp.’s
renewable-energy unit, two people with knowledge of the
transaction said.  Temasek, Singapore’s state investment company, will take a
$50 million stake in Huaneng Renewables Corp.’s IPO in Hong Kong,
said the people, who declined to be identified before an
announcement.  State Grid  will purchase a $60 million share, the
people said.  Tan Yong Meng , a spokesman for Temasek, declined to comment.
Lu Jian, a Beijing-based spokesman for State Grid, and Wang
Hongmei, head of media relations at Huaneng Group, weren’t
immediately available to comment.  Huaneng Group, China’s biggest electricity producer, is
seeking as much as $1.3 billion from Huaneng Renewables’s IPO.
Some 2.5 billion shares are being sold for HK$2.98 to HK$3.98
apiece, according to terms sent to investors Nov. 29. The stock
is due to start trading Dec. 16, according to the term sheet.  The IPO will add to the record $45.4 billion raised in Hong
Kong through initial share sales this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The amount excludes funds raised from
exercising over-allotment options.  To contact the reporters on this story:
