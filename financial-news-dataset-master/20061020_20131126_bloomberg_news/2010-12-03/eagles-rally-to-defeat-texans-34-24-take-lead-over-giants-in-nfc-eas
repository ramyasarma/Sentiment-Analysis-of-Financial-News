Michael Vick  sparked a fourth-quarter
rally by scoring the go-ahead touchdown as the Philadelphia
Eagles beat the Houston Texans 34-24.  The Eagles surrendered a 20-10 halftime lead as Houston
scored twice in the third quarter to go up 24-20. Quarterback
Vick then scored on a 2-yard plunge before finding  Owen Schmitt 
with a 5-yard scoring pass.  “It was tough,” Vick said in a televised interview at
Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. “Now we’ll take a
break to focus on the last quarter of the season.”  The win gives the Eagles (8-4) a half-game lead over the New
York Giants (7-4) atop the National Football Conference East
Division  LeSean McCoy  got the opening score midway through the first
quarter on a 1-yard pass from Vick and added a second touchdown
in the second quarter on a 4-yard run.  “It set the tone for the whole night,” McCoy said in a
televised interview. “We slowed up in the middle and got strong
at the end.”  Jacoby Jones  then scored on an 8-yard pass from Houston
quarterback  Matt Schaub  before  Arian Foster  got two third-
quarter touchdowns to put the Texans ahead.  Schaub completed 22 of 36 passing attempts for 337 yards,
two touchdowns and one interception for the Texans (5-7), while
Vick went 22 for 33 for 302 yards and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
