Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc.’s 
Australian unit exited bankruptcy protection after winning
approval of its restructuring from creditors, the company said.  Management and control of the unit reverts to the directors,
Krispy Kreme Australia said in an e-mailed statement today.
Creditors can file claims against a A$2.3 million ($2.2 million)
fund that was approved as part of the restructuring and will
probably receive 45 cents for each dollar they’re owed, the
company said.  Krispy Kreme Australia appointed voluntary administrators,
the Australian version of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the
U.S., after directors concluded that the company was at risk of
not meeting its financial obligations due to a number of
underperforming stores. The company shut 24 of its 59 stores in
the country as part of the restructuring.  “The remaining outlets all have strong sales,”  John McGuigan , Sydney-based chairman of Krispy Kreme Australia, said
in the statement. “The company can now continue trading without
underperforming stores adversely affecting the business.”  Krispy Kreme Australia employs 490 people. It fired 15
full-time workers, 142 part-time workers and 44 casual employees
as part of the restructuring, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
