The cash rubber price in Thailand
climbed to a record, rising 1.5 percent to 134.05 baht ($4.40)
per kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand. Demand remains strong amid a supply shortage as
rain persists in southern Thailand, the institute said.
Thailand’s south accounts for 80 percent of total production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
