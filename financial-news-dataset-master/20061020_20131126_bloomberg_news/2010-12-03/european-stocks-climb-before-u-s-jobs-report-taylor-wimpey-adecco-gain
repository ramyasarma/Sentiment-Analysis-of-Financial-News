European stocks advanced, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index poised to snap three weeks of losses,
before a report that may show the labor market in the world’s
largest economy has begun to improve. U.S. futures were
unchanged and Asian shares gained.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 climbed 0.3 percent to 272.41 at
9:49 a.m. in London, after earlier swinging between gains and
losses at least 13 times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
