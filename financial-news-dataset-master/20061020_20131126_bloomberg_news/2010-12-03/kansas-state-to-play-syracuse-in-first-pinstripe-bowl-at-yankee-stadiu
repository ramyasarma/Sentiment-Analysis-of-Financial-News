Kansas State University will play
Syracuse University in the inaugural bowl game at the
new Yankee Stadium, the first postseason college football game
in the Bronx in 48 years.  Kansas State accepted an invitation this morning to play
the Orange in the Pinstripe Bowl, the school said in a release.
The Wildcats were 7-5 this year, finishing third in the Big 12
North Division. Syracuse, 7-4, accepted an invitation to the
game yesterday.  “The chance for our student-athletes, band members,
cheerleaders and fans to experience New York City and compete in
one of the most famous venues in all of sports is a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity,” Kansas State Athletic Director John
Currie said in the statement. “We look forward to turning the
Big Apple purple.”  The two teams have met twice before, both during postseason
play. The No. 10 Wildcats beat the No. 14 Orange 35-18 in the
1997 Fiesta Bowl, and Syracuse won the second meeting, a 26-3
win in the 2001 Insight.com Bowl.  The last bowl game in the Bronx was the 1962 Gotham Bowl at
the original Yankee Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
