Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he may consider bringing forward a goal of
balancing the budget within five years after consulting with
various groups over the next few months.  Flaherty, in Montreal today for pre-budget consultations,
told reporters Canada is on the “right track,” while the
global recovery remains “fragile.”  Flaherty is seeking to make Canada the first country in the
Group of Seven to  balance its budget  by 2015-16, even as he cuts
corporate income taxes and faces a weak global recovery that
threatens to slow revenue. The minister expects deficits
totaling C$107 billion ($106.4 billion) through 2016.  Asked if he would consider postponing the target, Flaherty
initially answered “Yes, we are open to that. We are
listening.”  Flaherty then said he will also consider the opposite
scenario: a return to balance sooner than 2015-16.  “To do that would require some measures, and some
increasing restraint on spending,” he said. “So we have to
look at that, and look at that carefully because we do have
modest economic growth, and we have to make sure that we
continue modest economic growth.”  Canadian governments typically release budgets before the
start of the fiscal year, which begins April 1.  To contact the reporter for this story:
