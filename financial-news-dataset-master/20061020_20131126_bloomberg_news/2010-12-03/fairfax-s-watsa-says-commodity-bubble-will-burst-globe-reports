Prem Watsa, the chief executive
officer of Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., doesn’t believe the
prices of resources and agricultural products will rise
indefinitely, the Globe & Mail reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Watsa said pension
funds are putting a lot of money into the commodities market and
that risks creating a bubble.  Recessions take out such “excesses,” the Globe & Mail
cited him as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
