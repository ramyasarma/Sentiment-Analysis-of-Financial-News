Copper prices rose, capping the
biggest weekly gain in more than four months, after a report
showed U.S. service industries expanded at the fastest pace in
six months.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index, which covers about 90 percent of the economy, rose to 55
last month from 54.3 in October. A reading higher than 50
signals growth. The dollar fell for the third straight day
against a basket of major currencies, enhancing the investment
appeal of raw materials.  “The market is breathing a sigh of relief after the ISM
number,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago. “The weaker dollar also helps to boost
commodities. Copper will probably rise into the year-end.”  Copper futures for March delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $3.999 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. The most-active contract gained 6.3 percent this
week, the most since late July.  Earlier, the metal fell as much as 0.8 percent as an
unexpected increase in U.S. unemployment damped prospects for
the economic recovery.  Copper has jumped 39 percent since July 1 as growth in
emerging markets bolstered demand and tightened supplies. On
Nov. 11, the price reached a 30-month high of $4.0875. The
record high was $4.2605 on May 5, 2008.  Copper may reach $5 by the middle of 2011 because  “China,
Brazil and India are still expanding,” said  Michael K. Smith ,
the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,
Florida.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added $5 to $8,725 a metric ton ($3.96 a pound).  Tin was unchanged in London. Aluminum, lead, nickel and
zinc fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
