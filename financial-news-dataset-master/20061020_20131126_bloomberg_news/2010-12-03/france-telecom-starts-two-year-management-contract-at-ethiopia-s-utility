France Telecom SA  started a two-year
contract to manage Ethiopia’s state-owned Ethio Telecom,
Communications and Information Technology Minister Debretsion
Gebremichael said.  The Paris-based company will, depending on performance,
earn a fee of 30 million euros ($40 million) to manage the
utility, Debretsion told reporters yesterday in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia’s capital.  Accounting systems will be modernized and new services
introduced, Ethio Telecom chief executive officer Jean-Michel
Latute said.  Ethio Telecom replaced the Ethiopian Telecommunications
Corp. on Nov. 29 to help boost services and infrastructure. The
East African nation is the second-most expensive country in the
world for broadband Internet, according to the United Nation’s
International Telecommunications Union.  An underwater fiber-optic cable link via Djibouti will
increase capacity and lower broadband Internet costs, Debretsion
said.  To contact the reporter on this story: William Davison in Addis
