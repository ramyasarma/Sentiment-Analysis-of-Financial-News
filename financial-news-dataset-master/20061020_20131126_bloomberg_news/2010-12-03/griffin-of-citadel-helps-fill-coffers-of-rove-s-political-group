Kenneth Griffin , chief executive of
Citadel Investment Group LLC, and his wife  Anne  each contributed
$250,000 to  Karl Rove ’s American Crossroads fundraising group,
new  Federal Election Commission  reports show.  Griffin, who runs the $12.5 billion hedge fund based in
Chicago, called the U.S. government’s role in the financial
system “frightening” at an April 2009 conference. His wife is
managing partner of Aragon Global Management LLC, also based in
Chicago.  American Crossroads  took in $3.8 million between Oct. 14
and Nov. 22, including $250,000 from  Thomas Siebel , founder of
 Siebel Systems Inc.  and now chairman of Palo Alto, California-
based First Virtual Group; and $950,000 from  B. Wayne Hughes ,
chairman of Glendale, California-based  Public Storage , bringing
his total contributions to the group to $3.3 million.  The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan has subpoenaed
Citadel as part of an investigation into insider trading, the
Wall Street Journal reported Nov. 23.  Griffin also gave $650,000 to the Republican Governors
Association, including $150,000 on Oct. 11,  Internal Revenue
Service  filings show.  Devon Spurgeon , a spokeswoman for Citadel, declined
comment.  $71 Million  American Crossroads, which discloses its donors, and its
affiliate,  Crossroads GPS , which doesn’t, raised $71 million for
the 2010 elections, according to  Jonathan Collegio , a spokesman
for both groups. American Crossroads is the biggest of the so-
called “super” political action committees, which can take in
unlimited donations from corporations, unions and individuals.  The Crossroads groups spent $38 million, more than any
other organization, to help elect Republican candidates in this
year’s mid-term elections. Both groups were advised by Rove,
former President  George W. Bush ’s chief political strategist.  The elections resulted in a Republican net gain of six
governorships, six Senate seats and at least 63 House seats,
with a race still undecided in a New York district. Republicans
will control the House in the new Congress that convenes in
early January and control 47 seats in the 100-member Senate.  The Crossroads groups plan to remain active on issues such
as taxes and health care, Collegio said.  Concerned Taxpayers  Another Republican super PAC, Concerned Taxpayers of
America, took in $307,500 between Oct. 14 and Nov. 22, all but
$30,000 from  Robert Mercer , co-chief executive of Renaissance
Technologies Corp., an East Setauket, New York, hedge fund. The
PAC raised $957,500 for the elections, with $627,500 coming from
Mercer. Concerned Taxpayers spent $789,452, all on House races.  Labor unions were the biggest contributors to Democratic
super PACs in the campaign’s last three weeks. The National
Education Association contributed $400,000 and the Service
Employees International Union gave $250,000 to Commonsense Ten,
a Washington-based group run by Democratic strategists.  The American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees contributed $300,000 to Patriot Majority, which aired
advertisements in support of Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid .
The Nevada Democrat defeated Tea Party favorite  Sharron Angle Nov . 2.  The trial lawyers’ trade group, the  American Association
for Justice,  gave $325,000 to Commonsense Ten, increasing its
total donations to the PAC to $575,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
