Maximilian I never had enough money
for his military adventures, so he borrowed it. One family happy
to lend the Holy Roman Emperor whatever he asked for was the
House of Fugger.  Originally in the textile trade, the Fuggers expanded their
range when Maximilian’s regular defaults gave them large
holdings in the Habsburg mines he’d used as collateral.  Having learned the art of double-entry bookkeeping in
Venice, brilliant young Jacob Fugger put profits to use in early
versions of commodities futures contracts, currency arbitrage,
bills of exchange and an information-gathering service.  Opportunities abounded as empires rose and fell during the
first era of globalization. By 1500, the Fuggers could boast of
wealth comparable to the combined 20th century fortunes of the
Rockefellers and J.P. Morgan.  I spoke with  Howard J. Erlichman , author of “ Conquest,
Tribute and Trade ,” on the following topics:  1. Rise of Portugal and Spain  2. Christians vs. Muslims  3. Squandering the Wealth  4. Ramping Up the Slave Trade  5. Dutch Advance  To listen to the podcast, click  here . To buy this book in North
