The euro’s drop in the past month
has pushed the currency through key levels on a so-called
ichimoku chart, indicating its decline may continue to $1.25
next year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, citing trading
patterns.  The common currency reached a nine-month high of $1.4282
on Nov. 4, climbing from $1.1877 on June 7, the lowest level
since March 2006. The currency broke below the bottom of an
ichimoku cloud chart at the $1.3374 level, and its shorter-
term conversion line crossed below its longer-term baseline.
It also fell below $1.3080, which represents a 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement of a rally from June to November.  “After the euro successively broke below key ichimoku
and Fibonacci levels, the momentum is clearly downwards,”
said  Tomoko Fujii , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. “With the declining
trend likely to continue at least for several quarters, the
euro will target the four-year low reached in June.”  A level of $1.2796 “naturally comes into sight,” as
it’s a 61.8 percent decline from last month’s peak, with the
next key level a $1.2445, a 76.4 percent change, Fujii said,
citing percentage changes predicted by the Fibonacci sequence.
The euro may fall below $1.25 early next year at the earliest
and by the middle of next year at the latest, she said.  The currency has been the worst performer against the
dollar so far this year after the Danish krone.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s
direction by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and
lows. The conversion line plots the sum of the highest high
and lowest low over the past nine trading days. The baseline
is the same calculation over the past 26 days. The cloud
refers to the area between the first and second leading span
lines on the chart and is used to show an area where buy
orders may be clustered.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the idea that asset
prices reach peaks and troughs at specific percentages of
previous trends in the chart.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in
a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
