Cotton prices surged, capping the
biggest weekly gain in 39 years, on mounting concern that
exports will be limited from India, the world’s second-largest
grower.  Cotton-yarn shipments will be capped at 720,000 metric tons
in the year that started Oct. 1 in a bid to stabilize domestic
prices and boost supply, the Indian government said Dec. 1.
Futures in New York have soared 75 percent this year as demand
in China climbed and inventories plunged in the U.S., the top
exporter.  “India is unreliable,” said  Keith Brown , the president of
Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in Moultrie, Georgia. “We
haven’t solved any kind of problem.”  For the third straight day, prices on ICE Futures U.S. rose
the most allowed. Cotton for March delivery jumped by the limit
of 6 cents, or 4.7 percent, to settle at $1.3234 a pound at 2:56
p.m. in New York, the largest gain since July 2009.  The May and July contracts also advanced by the exchange
limit.  This week, the most-active contract jumped 18 percent, the
most since July 9, 1971. Cotton rose to a record $1.5195 on Nov.
10.  Cotton has “seen a lot of bullish news with these problems
in India this week, and we had some good export sales last
week” for U.S. supplies, said  Jack Scoville , a vice president
at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago. “We finished our
correction, and we’re off to the races.”  Rising Exports  Shipments of U.S. upland cotton totaled 322,977 bales in
the week ended Nov. 25, up from 250,684 a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms. China is the biggest grower and
consumer.  U.S.  inventories  have tumbled 74 percent this year, heading
for the largest annual decline since at least 2003, when the
data begins. Stockpiles held in warehouses monitored by ICE
plunged to 8,910 bales in October, touching at least an eight-
year low.  In July, there may be a “crunch” in the market because
“we will have exhausted all of last year’s supply and have yet
to gather next year’s crop,” Brown of Keith Brown & Co. said.
“That’s when the market could get into what I call ‘white
heat,’ that’s as hot as it gets to the upside.”  Last month, the USDA predicted that plantings will rise 21
percent to 11.04 million acres in the spring. Wheat and feed
grain acreage will decline, the agency said in a Nov. 9  report .
In India, production will climb to 26 million bales in the
season that began Aug. 1, up 12 percent from a year earlier, the
USDA estimates.  December ‘Squeeze’  Cotton for December delivery rose as much as 12.64 cents,
or 9.2 percent, to $1.4998.  “The squeeze that we’re seeing shows that the immediate
demand for cotton remains very strong,” said  O.A. Cleveland , an
analyst at cottonexperts.com in Starkville, Mississippi.
“People are fighting over 70,000 bales.”  Last month, Cleveland predicted the contract would jump 20
cents to $1.479 as expiration approached. The last trading day
is Dec. 8.  As of today, 697 contracts, or about 72,500 bales, were
called for physical delivery, according to the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
