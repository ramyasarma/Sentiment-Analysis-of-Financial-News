Spidey and the Green Goblin battling
it out right over your head makes the intermittent suffering
worthwhile -- like those seats for midgets, the relentlessly
deafening score by U2’s Bono and the Edge and the weird
storyline, both inept and complex and largely by director  Julie Taymor .  So catch a preview of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,”
before the $65 million musical opens Jan. 11.  Reeve Carney is a sweetly game Peter Parker, but the real
heroes are the creative team responsible for the eye-popping
effects and fabulous scenery: set designer  George Tsypin ,
costumer Eiko Ishioka, and aerial choreographer Daniel Ezralow.  At the Foxwoods Theatre, 213 W. 42nd St. Information: +1-
877-250-2929;  http://spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com/   Stop by Joe Allen for a burger after the show.  Contemplate Spidey’s future as you examine the wall of
flops, with posters from such shows as “Home Sweet Homer” with
Yul Brynner, which had but a single performance.  The closing notice was posted even before the curtain fell.  At  326 W.  46th St. Information: +1-212-581-6464.  Saturday  Visit Chelsea to see works by heavy-hitters  Luc Tuymans  and
 Anselm Kiefer .  It’s a simple red curve on a beige background, suggestive
of a fishook, a flesh wound or a dollar sign. The oil painting
is, in fact, a representation of the Fortis Bank logo, and it’s
part of “Corporate,” the Tuymans show at the David Zwirner
gallery.  Having taken on such fraught subjects as concentration
camps and colonialism in Africa, the Belgian artist this time
ponders the invisible corporate hand.  David Zwirner is at 525 W. 19th St. Information: +1-212-
727-2070;  http://www.davidzwirner.com/   In 1969 Kiefer created a series of photographs of himself
standing in front of European ruins, giving the Nazi salute.  Now he’s packed 76 of them inside a menacing steel box
allowing glimpses of the images from open side doors. This is
“Occupations,” the largest installation in his current show at
Gagosian.  At 555 W. 24th St. Information: +1-212-741-1111;
 http://www.gagosian.com/   Saturday Afternoon  You can make a difference in the lives of the “garbage
dwellers” of Cairo, who live mainly by recycling trash.  “Crafts of Cairo,” an annual sale organized by WQXR radio
host Nimet Habachy, offers colorful quilts, tote bags and rugs
made by Zabbaleen women after they were provided with looms,
materials and training.  All proceeds go to support two schools in Cairo.  At Calvary-St. George’s Church from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
61 Gramercy Park North, at 21st Street. Information: +1-703-875-
9370;  http://www.handsalongthenile.org/   Saturday Night  Head out to Glasslands Gallery in Williamsburg for the
thumping, oddly heartfelt electro of Diamond Rings.  Hurdling over tinkly synths and pulsing drums, frontman
John O’Regan’s baritone bestows gravitas on tracks that could be
played purely for their pop pleasures.  Glasslands’s lofty ceilings, wooden balcony and illuminated
paper thunderclouds provide the perfect space for O’Regan’s lo-
fi theatricality.  At 289 Kent Ave., Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Information: +1-
718-599-1450;  http://glasslands.blogspot.com/   Then cool off with a quick walk to The Woods for cheap
booze, more dancing and a revitalizing taco from the truck
parked in the all-seasons patio.  The lights are low, the dance floor full and there’s never
an off night. Open until 4 a.m.  48 S. 4th Street at Wythe Ave., Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Information: +1-718-782-4955.  Sunday  Check out Christmas in the city. Make a quick stop at the
comical foodie windows at Barneys, where chef  Mario Batali ’s
head is served up on a silver platter. Meanwhile, Miss Illy is
decked out in her gown of recycled coffee packs.  Adore the  Rockefeller Center  tree, decorated with over five
miles of LED lights and crowned with a Swarovski crystal star.  Walk down the alley of white herald angels and cross Fifth
Avenue to look in the windows of Saks, where glamor-puss
mannequins jostle kids diving with gigantic octopuses, riding
elephant babies and taking flight in hot-air balloons.  Then head down to Lord & Taylor’s elaborate animated
displays for a dozen different holiday scenes. There’s Haul Out
the Holly, Deck the Halls and Picking Out a Christmas Tree.  Barneys is at 660 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-826-
8900.  Saks is at 611 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-753-4000.  Lord & Taylor is at 424 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-391-
3344.  Rockefeller Center is between 49th and 50th Streets and
Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Information: +1-212-332-6868.  (With assistance from  Lili Rosboch  and  Daniel Billy .  Zinta Lundborg  is an editor for Muse, the arts and leisure section of
