Donna Orender  resigned as president
of the Women’s National Basketball Association to launch an
independent marketing company.  Orender’s resignation, effective at the end of the year,
comes after six years in which the league experienced growth in
attendance, television ratings and sponsorship, according to a
WNBA statement. Orender Unlimited, her marketing, media and
strategy company, will start next year.  “It was simply time for me to take this step in my life,”
Orender said in the statement. “My work on behalf of women and
girls around the world will only deepen as will my ongoing
engagement in sports.”  Orender, a former All-American basketball player at Queens
College of New York, received the 2006  March of Dimes ’
Sports Leadership Award and recently was selected as a global
ambassador to the United Nations’  Girl Up  campaign. She will
continue to serve as a consultant for the league, the statement
said.  Chris Granger, NBA senior vice president of team marketing
and business operations, will assume Orender’s duties until a
full-time successor is chosen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
