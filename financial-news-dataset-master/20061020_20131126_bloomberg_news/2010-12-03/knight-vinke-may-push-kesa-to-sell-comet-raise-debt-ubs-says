Knight Vinke Asset Management LLC,
the investment firm that said Nov. 30 it raised its voting
stake in  Kesa Electricals Plc  to 8.8 percent, may seek the
disposal of the  retailer ’s Comet electronics chain, a sale and
leaseback of its French stores or an increase in debt, UBS AG
said.  “Knight Vinke may try to instigate a one-off return of
capital,” UBS analysts including  Andrew Hughes  and  Adam Cochrane  said in a report. “Increasing the financial gearing
and returning cash to shareholders is probably the most
likely.” The brokerage has a “neutral” rating on Kesa.  Knight Vinke, based in New York, has built up the second-
largest  shareholding  in Kesa with five share purchases in the
last two months. Los Angeles-based Capital Research is the
largest shareholder in the retailer, which also owns the Darty
consumer electronics chain in France, according to Bloomberg
data.  If Kesa sells and leases back 300 million euros ($398
million) of French property, it “is unlikely to create
significant value” as capital would have to passed to pension
trustees, UBS said. Increasing  borrowing  to 500 million euros,
with 300 million euros secured against property, is the “most
feasible” option, they wrote.  The brokerage said it is “hard to see” a trade buyer or
private equity group being interested in buying the Comet
business in the U.K., and a sale of the emerging markets
businesses would limit future growth opportunities.  Kesa reports interim results on Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
