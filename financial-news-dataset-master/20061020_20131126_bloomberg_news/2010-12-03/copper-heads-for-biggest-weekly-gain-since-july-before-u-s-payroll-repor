Copper headed for the first weekly
advance in four weeks in New York before a report that may
indicate a strengthening economy in the U.S., the world’s
second-largest consumer of the metal.  An increase in November payrolls probably pushed U.S. job
gains past the 1 million mark for the year, economists said.
Copper added 5.6 percent this week as reports showed stronger
manufacturing in China, the U.S. and Europe and inventories
tracked by the London Metal Exchange shrank for a 41st week in a
row.  “The market is just on hold ahead of U.S. payrolls
today,” said  David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in
London.  Copper for delivery in March slipped 0.4 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $3.975 a pound at 7:47 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months lost 0.1 percent to
$8,710 a metric ton on the LME. All of the six main metals
traded on the LME retreated except nickel.  The payroll figures are due at 8:30 a.m. New York time.
They will show that employment increased by 150,000 last month,
according to the median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, bringing the gain so far this year to 1.02
million.  ‘Blue Skies’  “The monthly nonfarm payroll report in the U.S. will
either confirm the optimism that positive economic reports have
helped build this week, in which case it really is clear blue
skies into the end of year, or a disappointing number will cut
the rally short,” said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at
UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow. “Investors are, however,
clearly in the mood for a strong end to 2010.”  Separate figures due at 10 a.m. New York time may show that
service industries, which account for almost 90 percent of the
U.S. economy, expanded last month at the fastest pace since May
as more jobs and rising wages boosted holiday sales.  LME copper  inventories  fell 0.9 percent this week to
353,625 tons. They’re down 30 percent this year, on course for
the first annual decline since 2004. Stocks monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange declined for a second week, the bourse
said today.  Immediate-delivery LME copper’s premium to three-month
metal fell for a second day, dropping 8.3 percent to $50 a ton
after reaching $74, the highest level since October 2008, on
Dec. 1. Prices moved on Nov. 8 to a so-called backwardation,
when nearby metal trades above longer-term contracts,
potentially signaling supply concern.  Borrowing Fee  Tightness in the copper market “eased a lot” yesterday,
Citigroup’s Thurtell said.  The fee to borrow copper for next-day delivery, the so-
called tom-next spread, was last at a discount of $1.75,
compared with yesterday’s closing $4 discount. An increase in
the fee would indicate tightening supply.  An unidentified party held between 50 percent and 79
percent of LME copper stockpiles from Nov. 22 through at least
Dec. 1, the latest exchange data show. Another unidentified firm
held the same amount of LME nickel stockpiles on Dec. 1.  Wage talks at  Anglo American Plc  and Xstrata Plc’s
Collahuasi mine in Chile are set to extend into a fifth day as
union and company representatives seek to end a strike at the
world’s third-biggest copper mine, a union leader said
yesterday. The strike entered its 28th day yesterday, the
longest recorded at a major Chilean copper mine.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME slid 0.6 percent to
$25,400 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,500 on Nov. 9. The
metal has jumped 50 percent this year, leading advances on the
exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.  Aluminum fell 0.2 percent to $2,343 a ton and nickel was
unchanged at $23,650 a ton. Lead dropped 0.3 percent to $2,367 a
ton and zinc declined 1.4 percent to $2,228 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
