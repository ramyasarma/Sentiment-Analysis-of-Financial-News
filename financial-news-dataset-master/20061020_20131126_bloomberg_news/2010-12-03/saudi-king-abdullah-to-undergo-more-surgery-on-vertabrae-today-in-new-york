Saudi Arabia’s  King Abdullah  will
undergo more surgery today in New York to repair several
vertebrae, the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing a
statement from the Royal Court.  The surgery is part of the 86-year-old king’s treatment for
a back injury and was recommended by his doctors, the agency
said.  King Abdullah arrived in New York on Nov. 23 and underwent
surgery the next day at New York Presbyterian Hospital to remove
a blood clot and adjust a slipped disk, the  Saudi Embassy in
Washington  said. Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah said the
king’s health was “very reassuring” and that he had started
physical therapy, the news service said on Nov. 28.  The king delegated the management of the affairs of the
world’s largest oil supplier to his half-brother,  Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz , during his absence, SPA said on Nov. 22.  Oil fell 0.5 percent to $87.59 a barrel at 8:20 a.m. in
London, down from a two-year high yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
