Deutsche Lufthansa AG  said it has
been operating an  Airbus SAS A380  with a suspect  Rolls-Royce
Group Plc  engine for the past two weeks as it awaited a modified
version of the Trent 900 turbine.  The engine, similar to one that blew up during a Qantas
Airways Ltd. flight on Nov. 4, was given rigorous checks after
each trip and posed no safety risk, Lufthansa spokesman  Thomas Jachnow  said today in a telephone interview. The Cologne,
Germany-based carrier first announced the swap on Nov. 18.  The other 15 turbines on Lufthansa’s four A380s are “non-
critical” because they’re from a newer batch, Jachnow said,
though the airline is continuing checks at least every 20 flight
cycles as mandated by the European Aviation Safety Agency.  An oil leak from a misaligned pipe led to the Qantas
explosion, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said
yesterday. The Sydney-based airline grounded its superjumbo
fleet for more than three weeks and has begun talks with Rolls-
Royce to retrieve lost money. Qantas, Lufthansa and Singapore
Airlines Ltd. are the only carriers using the Trent 900 model.  The replacement engine to be installed by Lufthansa is one
of the carrier’s own, and was outfitted with a new oil pipe at
its venture with Rolls-Royce in Arnstadt, Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
