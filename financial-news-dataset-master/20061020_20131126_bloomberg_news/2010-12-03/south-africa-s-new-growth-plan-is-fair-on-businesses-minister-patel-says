South Africa’s new growth plan
provides a fair balance between what the state and businesses
can do to create jobs and boost economic growth, Economic
Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said.  The government’s role is to provide the core functions that
will create the space for the private sector to add jobs, such
as infrastructure, skills development and addressing price
collusion, Patel said in a column in the Johannesburg-based
Business Day newspaper.  “If we relied on existing initiatives, we could not hope
to step up across the economy,” he said.  The plan, which aims to generate five million new jobs by
2020, creates a framework for debate on what is needed for
growth and job creation and should encourage debate, Patel said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
