European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said the euro area’s 16-member governments must
take all steps necessary to make their deficit reduction plans
credible.  “We have the same message for all countries,” Trichet
said today on RTL radio from Paris. “We say to them, ‘take all
measures to make next year’s fiscal objectives credible. It’s
important for confidence, notably for the confidence of
investors and savers.’”  Trichet also said that the European Union has the
“instruments” necessary to deal with threats to the euro and
that the ECB’s current interest rates are “appropriate.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
