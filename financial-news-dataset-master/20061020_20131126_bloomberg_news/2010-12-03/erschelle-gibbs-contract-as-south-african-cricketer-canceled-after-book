Cricket South Africa said it canceled
the national contract of Herschelle Gibbs by mutual agreement
following the release last month of the cricketer’s
autobiography of his 14 years representing the country.  “It has been decided that this is the best way forward for
both parties,” Cricket SA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Confidentiality agreements were signed and Cricket SA and Gibbs
won’t comment further on the matter, the sport body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
