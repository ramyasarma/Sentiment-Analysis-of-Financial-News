FirstRand Ltd ., South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, said first-half
profit will increase by at least 20 percent.  “This is due to the significant gain arising from the
unbundling of Momentum,” the Johannesburg-based lender said in
a statement today.  FirstRand merged its insurance unit, Momentum Group Ltd.,
with Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. earlier this year to create the
third-biggest listed insurer in South Africa, after Sanlam Ltd.
and Old Mutual Plc. Metropolitan subsequently changed its name
to  MMI Holdings Ltd.  and the merged entity has a market value of
25.2 billion rand ($3.7 billion).  FirstRand  gained 36 cents, or 1.8 percent, to 20.80 rand in
Johannesburg trading, its biggest one-day gain since Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
