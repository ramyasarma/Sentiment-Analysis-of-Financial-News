About 50 Kenyan lawmakers backed a
draft legislative motion saying the International Criminal Court
should be denied the legal authority to prosecute suspects in
post-election violence in 2008, the  Standard  reported.  Legislator Isaac Ruto plans to present the motion to
Kenya’s parliament on Dec. 8, the Nairobi-based newspaper said,
without saying where it got the information from.  ICC Chief Prosecutor  Luis Moreno-Ocampo  plans by Dec. 17 to
present cases against six people who bear the greatest
responsibility for Kenyan violence following a disputed
presidential election in December 2007, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
