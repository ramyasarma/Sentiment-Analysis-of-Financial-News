Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, reported fourth-quarter profit that
unexpectedly fell on lower trading fees and higher expenses.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 fell 9.4 percent to
C$1.12 billion ($1.12 billion), or 74 cents a share, from C$1.24
billion, or 82 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank
said today in a statement. Revenue fell 3.4 percent to C$7.2
billion.  Royal Bank is the third Canadian lender to post a decline
in profit for the period, as rising costs for compensation and
marketing and falling trading revenue reduced earnings. Royal
Bank’s trading income fell by half in the quarter, led by fixed-
income and interest rates.  Royal Bank said adjusted earnings were 84 cents a share,
trailing the C$1.01 a share average  estimate  of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The bank has missed estimates for
five straight quarters.  “This strikes me as a pretty big miss,” said Ian
Nakamoto, director of research at MacDougall MacDougall &
MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which manages about C$4 billion
including banks.  Royal Bank  fell 52 cents to C$55.72 yesterday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 1.2 percent this
year, compared with a 7.5 percent gain for the 10-company
 Standard & Poor’s/TSX Banks Index .  More Pressure  The shares, the worst performing this year among the
country’s biggest banks, will face “significant pressure” with
the results, said John Aiken, an analyst at Barclays Capital.  “The market will once again have to reset its expectations
for the bank,” he said in a note today.  Royal Bank set aside C$432 million for bad loans, about
half the amount from a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose
5.9 percent to C$3.8 billion.  Earnings from the RBC Capital Markets unit fell 34 percent
to C$373 million from C$561 million a year earlier on declines
in sales and trading. Trading revenue across the bank fell 48
percent to C$656 million.  Canadian consumer banking earnings rose 6.7 percent to
C$765 million on increased lending and lower loan-loss
provisions. International banking, which includes Raleigh, North
Carolina-based RBC Bank, posted a loss of C$157 million, the
10th consecutive money-losing quarter for the unit.  “Royal Bank has to demonstrate that they can actually get
a bang for their buck in the U.S.,” said  David Baskin ,
president of Baskin Financial Services in Toronto, which manages
C$370 million including banks. “They really have to show that
they can get their act together in the United States.”  Insurance Sale  Insurance fell 74 percent to C$27 million, after taking a
C$116 million loss on the October sale of its U.S. life
insurance business, Liberty Life Insurance.  Wealth management rose 8.7 percent to C$175 million from a
year earlier. Royal Bank said it had net income of C$5.22
billion for the year, up 35 percent driven by record earnings in
Canadian banking.  Royal Bank is the fourth Canadian lender to report fourth-
quarter results. National Bank of Canada, the country’s sixth-
biggest bank, posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates and
raised its  dividend  6.5 percent. Yesterday, Toronto-Dominion
Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported lower
profits as trading income declined.  Bank of Nova Scotia, the third-biggest bank, reports
results today. Bank of Montreal, the fourth-largest lender,
releases earnings Dec. 7.  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss fourth-
quarter results at 8 a.m. Toronto time. Dial +1-866-689-5910
