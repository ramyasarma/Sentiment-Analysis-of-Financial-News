Clearwire Corp. , the high-speed
wireless network carrier 54-percent owned by Sprint Nextel
Corp., sold $1.325 billion of bonds and exchangeable notes in a
three-part offering, according to a company statement
distributed today by Business Wire.  Clearwire sold the notes after last month saying it may not
have enough funding to keep operating. The company issued $175
million of 12 percent first-priority senior-secured debt due in
2015, according to the statement. The debt was issued in a
reopening of a November 2009 issue at a price of 105.182 cents
on the dollar. Clearwire also sold $500 million of 12 percent
second-priority secured debt due 2017 and $650 million of 8.25
percent exchangeable notes due 2040.  Proceeds may be used for working capital and for general
corporate purposes, Kirkland, Washington-based Clearwire said.
The company earlier marketed $500 million of exchangeable notes.  Clearwire is rated CCC by Standard & Poor’s, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The notes were issued through the company’s Clearwire
Communications LLC unit, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
