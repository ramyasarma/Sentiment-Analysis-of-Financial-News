Poland “shouldn’t hurry” to adopt
the euro until the European Union adjusts its political
institutions and economy to support a stable common currency,
central bank Governor Marek Belka said yesterday in a lecture in
Krakow cited by Dziennik Gazeta Prawna’s Forsal.pl website.  “The European Monetary Union is an ambitious but
unfinished project,” Belka said, noting the EU’s lack of a
common budget or centralized fiscal policy, according to
Forsal.pl. “As a surrogate we have the Maastricht Treaty, which
is a gentleman’s agreement, only it turned out there weren’t
enough gentlemen.”  Belka said while he favors Poland’s adopting the euro,
under current conditions the issue is “hypothetical,” the
website said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
