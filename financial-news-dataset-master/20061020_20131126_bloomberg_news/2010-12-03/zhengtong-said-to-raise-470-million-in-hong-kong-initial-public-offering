China ZhengTong Auto Services
Holdings Ltd. , the second biggest dealer of  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG  autos in China, raised HK$3.65 billion ($470 million)
selling stock in a Hong Kong initial public offering, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The company, which operates six of its 22 dealerships in
central China’s city of Wuhan, sold 500 million shares at
HK$7.30 apiece after offering them at HK$6.80 to HK$8.60 each,
said the people, who declined to be identified before an
announcement.  The final offer price values ZhengTong at 17 times forecast
2011 earnings, the people said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and CCB
International managed the transaction.  China’s surging vehicle sales have helped increase profits
and operations at ZhengTong and other auto dealers. ZhengTong
plans to use the share-sale proceeds to more than triple its
number of outlets to 68 by the end of 2012, according to its
share sale prospectus.  ZhengTong’s revenue rose 64 percent in 2009 from a year
earlier to 4.98 billion yuan ($748 million), according to the
listing document. Kelly Fung, a ZhengTong spokeswoman in Hong
Kong, was not immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
