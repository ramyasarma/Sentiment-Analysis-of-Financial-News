European stocks retreated after the
U.S. economy generated fewer jobs in November than economists
had forecast.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5 percent to
270.33 at 1:34 p.m. in London, after earlier swinging between
gains at losses at least 13 times. The number of jobs increased
by 39,000 last month, missing the average estimate of 150,000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
