Service industries expanded in
November at the fastest pace in six months, showing the U.S.
recovery is broadening out as the year comes to a close.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
 index , which covers about 90 percent of the economy, rose to 55
last month from 54.3 in October. A reading higher than 50
signals growth.  Target Corp.  is among retailers seeing stronger sales
during the holiday-shopping season, testament to the gains in
spending needed to encourage American companies to step up
hiring. A report from the Labor Department today showed the
economy generated fewer jobs last month than forecast, while the
jobless rate rose to the highest level since April.  “The economy is improving,” said  Jeffrey Roach , chief
economist at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
“It’s a sluggish recovery. The consumer is starting to spend,
starting to show renewed confidence in the recovery.”  The median forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected the ISM index would rise to 54.8. Estimates
ranged from 52.3 to 59.4.  Stocks trimmed losses and Treasury securities rose after
the report. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent to
1,219.27 at 10:39 a.m. in New York. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, fell to
2.96 percent from 2.99 percent late yesterday.  November Employment  Employers added 39,000 workers to their payrolls in
November, fewer than the most pessimistic projection of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, Labor Department figures
showed today. The  unemployment rate  increased to 9.8 percent
from 9.6 percent. In October 2009, joblessness rose to a 26-year
high of 10.1 percent.  The ISM non-manufacturing  employment  gauge rose to 52.7,
the highest since October 2007, from 50.9 a month earlier. The
measure of new orders increased to 57.7, the highest since
April, from 56.7. Business activity eased to 57 from 58.4.  The ISM’s index of prices paid fell to 63.2 from 68.3 a
month earlier.  The services survey covers industries that range from
utilities and merchants to health care, housing, finance and
transportation. The group’s  factory index , released Dec. 1, fell
to 56.6 last month from 56.9 in October.  The services index averaged 56.1 in the five years to
December 2007, when the last recession began. It averaged 51.6
since the current recovery started in June 2009 through October,
trailing the 55.2 reading for the ISM  manufacturing index  during
the same period.  Consumer Spending  The recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s has
been led by manufacturing as exports climbed, business
investment picked up and inventories were replenished. While the
housing industry remains a weak link, consumer spending, which
accounts for 70 percent of the economy, has been picking up.  The Federal Reserve, in its latest survey of regional
economies, said Dec. 1 the economy gained strength across much
of the U.S. as hiring improved, manufacturing expanded and
retailers anticipated a stronger holiday shopping season. The
survey covered the period from early October to mid-November.  Sales at Target,  Limited Brands Inc.  and  Costco Wholesale
Corp.  grew more than analysts estimated in November as more
confident consumers snapped up discounted merchandise,
particularly during the Thanksgiving weekend.  Estimated sales for Thanksgiving and the three days after
the U.S. holiday reached $45 billion, a 9.1 percent gain from a
year ago, as the number of shoppers rose 8.7 percent to 212
million, according to the National Retail Federation.  November Sales  “November sales were better than expected, driven by very
strong guest traffic throughout the month,”  Gregg Steinhafel ,
chief executive officer at Target, said yesterday in a
statement.  At the same time, construction is among the industries that
have weighed on the ISM non-manufacturing survey as home sales
hover near historic lows. New homes sold at a 283,000 annual
rate in October, near an all-time low and down from a recent
peak of 1.39 million in July 2005.  “New home sales are extremely low,”  Larry W. Seay , chief
financial officer at  Meritage Homes Corp ., said on a Nov. 11
teleconference. “The reason that sales are so low is due to
fear” that would-be buyers “might lose their job.”  As part of an effort to reach out to some of the nation’s
largest employers, President  Barack Obama  met with Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Mike Duke  at the White House
on Nov. 29. The meeting is one of a series of sessions aimed at
soliciting the views of companies, with the goal of spurring the
recovery and adding jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
