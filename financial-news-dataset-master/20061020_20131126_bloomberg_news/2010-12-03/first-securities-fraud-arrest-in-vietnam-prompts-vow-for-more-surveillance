Vietnam’s stock market regulator
pledged to clamp down on securities fraud as authorities
prosecute the nation’s first share-price manipulation case.  “We have increased surveillance to protect genuine
investors and ensure a fair playing field,”  Nguyen Doan Hung ,
vice chairman of the State Securities Commission, said in an
interview in Hanoi today. The arrest “sent a clear message that
any stock price manipulation will be punished strictly.”  Two executives at  Vien Dong Pharma Joint-Stock Co.  have
been arrested and more than 50 securities-fraud probes this year
led to fines, the commission’s website shows. Investigators are
monitoring trading daily and the commission increased its
biggest fines sevenfold to 500 million dong ($25,600) under a
law passed in September, said the regulator’s chief inspector,
Nguyen Thi Chan Phuong.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s  VN Index  today
climbed 1.5 percent, completing its best week in three months
and paring the world’s worst performance in the second half of
2010. The gauge has tumbled 60 percent from its peak in 2007 as
securities fraud allegations weakened sentiment hurt by
tightened lending to combat spiraling inflation, and three
currency devaluations since November last year to curb a
widening trade deficit.  Le Van Dung , the former chairman of Vien Dong Pharma who
was arrested last week, allegedly manipulated the  share price  of
another drugmaker, the State Securities Commission said in a
statement on its  website  today, citing initial police findings.
In a separate  announcement , the regulator said police arrested
 Cao Hong Van , deputy general director and chief accountant at
Vien Dong, after she allegedly paid bribes. A planned share sale
by Vien Dong Pharma may be canceled, the commission said.  Demand, Supply  Dung and unidentified people opened accounts to
“artificially” create demand and supply for shares of Hatay
Pharmaceutical Joint-Stock Co.  Hatay shares  have slumped 58
percent since spiking to a record 98,500 dong on Aug. 18. The
shares remain 46 percent higher this year.  The commission has also blocked securities trading accounts
held by the former chairman, Dung, two companies and 13 related
people as part of a fraud investigation, it said in statement
dated yesterday.  The clampdown is aimed at shoring up investor confidence,
Hung said. Local traders sometimes refer to the volatile Ho Chi
Minh City and Hanoi stock exchanges as “Hosino” and
“Hasino,” a play on “casino,” said Hoang Thach Lan, who
heads the brokerage unit at Ho Chi Minh City-based MHB
Securities Co., the investment arm of Mekong Housing Bank.
“Traders gave the exchanges the nicknames when people made
gains and then lost a lot more in the last three years.”  Clear, Firm  “Investors want to see the authorities taking a clear and
firm stance,”  Andy Ho , head of investment at VinaCapital
Investment Management Ltd., the country’s biggest fund manager,
said in an e-mail. “The authorities are establishing that they
are up to the task of regulating the market and ensuring that
price fixing and other transgressions don’t take place.”  MHB Securities’s Lan, who heads a brokerage unit, says the
commission can afford to do more. “What the regulator has done
so far is good, but it needs to impose harder, stronger
sanctions to stop similar frauds,” Lan said.  Vien Dong Pharma was placed on the exchange’s watch list on
Nov. 30, requiring more regular financial reports. Starting
yesterday, the State Securities Commission limited trading of
Vien Dong Pharma’s stock to 15 minutes a day, compared to the
regular trading session of 2 1/2 hours. The shares, which have
slumped 56 percent from a record on Sept. 10, rose 4.1 percent
today to 51,000 dong.  Worst Performer  The VN Index has sunk 8.4 percent in the second half of
2010, the worst performer among 87 benchmark indexes tracked by
Bloomberg worldwide.  The criminal investigation “marks a big step forward in
raising the level of compliance within the Vietnamese market,”
said  Dominic Scriven , Ho Chi Minh City-based chief executive
officer of Dragon Capital Group Ltd., Vietnam’s second-largest
investment firm.  “We want to increase surveillance to prevent further price
manipulation in the future,” Hung said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
