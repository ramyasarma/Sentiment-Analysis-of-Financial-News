New York City and National Grid NY
oppose a settlement between Chemtura Corp. and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, saying it is unfair and not in
the public interest. The settlement, which paves the way for
Chemtura’s exit from bankruptcy, requires the chemical maker to
clean up two sources of ongoing pollution to the Gowanus Canal
under a related agreement, according to court documents filed
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
