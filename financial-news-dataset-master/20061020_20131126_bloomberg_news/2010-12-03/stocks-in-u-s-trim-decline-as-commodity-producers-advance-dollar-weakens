U.S. stocks erased losses as a weaker
dollar boosted oil and metals prices, triggering a rally in
commodity producers that helped equities overcome an early slump
caused by an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,222.19 at 3:36 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as
0.4 percent earlier. The Dollar Index, which gauges the currency
against six major peers, lost 1.2 percent for its biggest
decline since October. Oil increased 1.4 percent to a 25-month
high near $89 a barrel and the S&P/GSCI commodities index
rallied 1.3 percent to above its highest closing level since
October 2008.  Earlier declines in stocks came after the Labor Department
said U.S. payrolls increased by 39,000 last month, trailing the
median economist projection in a Bloomberg News survey for an
increase of 150,000 jobs. The jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent
from 9.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
