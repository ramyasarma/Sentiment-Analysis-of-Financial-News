Gold futures topped $1,400 an ounce
and silver climbed to a 30-year high as the dollar’s slump
boosted the appeal of precious metals as alternative
investments. Palladium had the biggest weekly gain since 2008.  The  greenback  headed for the biggest drop in six weeks
after a U.S. government report showed employers added fewer jobs
than forecast in November and the unemployment rate rose to 9.8
percent, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will keep pumping
money into the financial system to bolster the economy. Gold
reached a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  “Ongoing economic uncertainty and the possibility of more
quantitative easing needed to counter high unemployment and
stagnation in an economic recovery are a solid ground for gold
investment,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland.  Gold futures for February delivery jumped $16.90, or 1.2
percent, to close at $1,406.20 at 2:15 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,409.90, the highest since
Nov. 12. This week, the metal gained up 3.1 percent, the most
since late May.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 69.9 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $29.271 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached
$29.37, the highest since March 1980. This week, the price
jumped 9.3 percent, the most since January.  Gold also gained on speculation China, the world’s second-
biggest buyer, will step up purchases.  China Outlook  China’s imports jumped almost fivefold in the 10 months
ended Oct. 31 from a year earlier on inflation concerns, the
Shanghai Gold Exchange said yesterday. The country should
consider adding to gold reserves to pave the way for
internationalization of the yuan,  Xia Bin , an adviser to the
central bank, said in commentary in the China Business News.  “In the mid- and longer-term, I think China is the biggest
bullish factor for gold prices,” said  Yuichi Ikemizu , the head
of commodity trading at Standard Bank Plc in Tokyo.  Gold has gained 28 percent this year, heading for the 10th
straight annual gain and the biggest since 2007.  Silver has jumped 74 percent in 2010, heading for the
biggest annual increase since 1979.  Palladium futures for March delivery gained $6.40, or 0.8
percent, to $770.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $780, the highest since
April 2001. This week, the metal jumped 13 percent, the most
since October 2008.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $15.40, or 0.9
percent, to $1,728.50 an ounce. This week, the price gained 5.1
percent, the most since mid-September.  This year, palladium has soared 88 percent, and platinum
has climbed 18 percent. The metals are used in jewelry and
pollution-control devices in cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
