Andritz AG , the world’s second-
biggest maker of hydropower plants, had its price estimate
raised to 72 euros from 68 euros at Hauck & Aufhaeuser, which
said the company’s acquisition of  A-Tec Industries AG ’s AE&E
Austria unit was positive for the shareholders of Andritz.  “The acquisition price has likely been very cheap,
possibly alone creating value of more than 2 euros per Andritz
share and it opens up new growth potential,” Roland Rapelius,
an analyst at Hauck, wrote in a note to investors today. In
addition “risks from existing projects are expected to be under
control as Andritz’ core competences are in large project
management” and “the industrial logic looks convincing as
Andritz so far was not active in larger fluidized bed boilers,”
which its competitor  Metso Oyj  is already offering.  Hans-Georg Kantner , the spokesman of insolvent A-Tec’s
creditor committee, said last night that Andritz had agreed to
buy the unit in a deal valued at between 5 million euros ($6.6
million) and 10 million euros. Andritz will pay for AE&E Austria
in cash and by taking over financial obligations, accoring to
Kantner, a representative of credit protection association
Kreditschutzverband von 1870.  Andritz today confirmed the acquisition without disclosing
a purchase price.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
