Growth in Europe’s services and
manufacturing  industries  accelerated at a faster pace than
initially estimated and retail sales increased more than
economists forecast, led by Germany.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in services businesses and factories climbed to 55.5 in
November from 53.8 in October, London-based Markit Economics
said today. It initially reported a gain to 55.4.  Retail sales 
rose 0.5 percent in October, the European Union statistics
office in Luxembourg said. Economists forecast 0.2 percent, the
median of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows.  Germany has powered the region’s recovery after global
growth boosted demand at companies including carmaker  Daimler AG 
and pushed down unemployment. With governments stepping up
austerity measures to counter a sovereign-debt crisis that
forced Ireland to seek aid last month, the European Commission
on Nov. 29 forecast a slowdown in 2011.  “The euro region’s dynamic is still rather robust with
Germany as the growth engine,” said  Andreas Scheuerle , an
economist at Dekabank in Frankfurt. “It looks like we’ll see a
positive surprise for fourth-quarter growth. Private consumption
should gain ground, bolstering imports and hence the recovery.”  A gauge of  services industries  increased to 55.4 from 53.3,
Markit said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The euro rose against the dollar today, and was at $1.3258
as of 10:06 a.m. in London compared with $1.3209 yesterday.  German Boost  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, the  services gauge 
jumped to 59.2 in November, the highest since August 2007, from
56 the previous month. That’s above an initial estimate of 58.6.
The country’s composite index for services and manufacturing
increased to 59 from 56.  Germany also led the gain in retail sales, with an increase
of 2.3 percent in October from the previous month. The next
strongest performance was Belgium’s 1.4 percent gain. From a
year earlier, euro-area retail sales increased 1.8 percent.  The Bundesbank raised its forecast for 2010 German economic
growth today, projecting the fastest expansion since data for a
reunified country began in 1992. Gross domestic product will
expand 3.6 percent in 2010 and 2 percent in 2011, the Frankfurt-
based central bank said. In June, it predicted growth of 1.9
percent this year and 1.4 percent next year, though in October
it said the economy may expand “more than 3 percent” in 2010.  Periphery Struggles  In France, the  services indicator  edged up to 55 from 54.8,
while Italy’s gained to 54.5 from 51, Markit said.  Europe’s so-called peripheral nations continued to
struggle. Spain’s services industry shrank in November, while
Ireland’s grew “marginally,” according to NCB Economics in
Dublin. The Irish index slipped to 50.8 from 50.9.  The European Commission on Nov. 29 forecast euro-region
growth to weaken to 1.5 percent in 2011 from 1.7 percent this
year, and said there’s “a very high” level of uncertainty.
While Germany may expand 3.7 percent this year, the economies of
Ireland, Greece and Spain will continue to shrink.  The euro-region’s  manufacturing gauge  rose to 55.3 in
November from 54.6 the previous month, Markit said on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
