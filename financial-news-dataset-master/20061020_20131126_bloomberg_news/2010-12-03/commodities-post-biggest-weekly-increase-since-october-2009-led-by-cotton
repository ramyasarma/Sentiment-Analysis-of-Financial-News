Commodities rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain since October 2009, as global shortfalls of cotton
and wheat drove agriculture prices higher.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  raw materials 
rose 4.06, or 1.3 percent, to settle at 316.16, boosting the
week’s rally to 5 percent.  Cotton had the biggest weekly jump in 39 years after India
put limits on exports. Heavy rain is eroding the quality of
Australian wheat after a drought cut Russian grain output. The
 dollar  tumbled against major currencies, boosting the investment
appeal of energy, metals and crops. Crude oil rose to a 25-month
high, and gold topped $1,400 an ounce.  “The perfect storm in commodities continues another
week,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodity brokerage in Medford, Oregon. “Between
weather problems, financial problems and China saying they want
to buy gold, all these markets are up pretty good today.”  The  UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index  of 26
prices advanced 1 percent to 1,561.89. This week, the gauge
climbed 4.9 percent, the most since July 2009.  The greenback fell the most in six weeks against a basket
of six currencies after a U.S. government report showed
employers added less than one-third as many jobs last month as
economists forecast, and the unemployment rate rose to 9.8
percent, increasing speculation that the recovery is faltering.  Shifts by funds into commodity markets also spurred the
rally, said Bill O’Neill, a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper
Saddle River, New Jersey.  Commodities at ‘Forefront’  “There’s a lot of money out there that needs to be
invested as we go into year-end,” O’Neill said. “Commodities
and gold in particular are at the forefront of that as an asset
class.”  Commodity assets under management increased $19 billion to
a record $340 billion in October, Barclays Capital said last
week.  The CRB index has climbed 20 percent since Aug. 31. In that
period, cotton and gold rose to records, silver jumped to a 30-
year high and copper advanced to a 30-month peak.  For the third straight day, cotton prices on ICE Futures
U.S. rose the most allowed. The March-delivery contract, the
most-active, jumped by the limit of 6 cents, or 4.7 percent, to
settle at $1.3234 a pound in New York, the biggest gain since
July 2009.  Wheat futures for March delivery jumped 30.5 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $7.79 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. This
week, the price gained 13 percent, the most since August.  ‘Unemployment, Stagnation’  Gold futures for February delivery jumped $16.90, or 1.2
percent, to close at $1,406.20 on the Comex in New York. This
week, the metal gained up 3.1 percent, the most since late May.
The metal reached a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  “Ongoing economic uncertainty and the possibility of more
quantitative easing needed to counter high unemployment and
stagnation in an economic recovery are a solid ground for gold
investment,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland.  China should consider adding to gold reserves to pave the
way for internationalization of the yuan, Xia Bin, an adviser to
the central bank, said in commentary in the China Business News.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 69.9 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $29.271 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the
metal reached $29.37, the highest since March 1980. This week,
the price jumped 9.3 percent, the most since January.  Crude-oil futures for January delivery rose $1.19 to $89.19
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
closing price since Oct. 7, 2008.  “The rally is due to a much lower dollar,” said Hamza
Khan, an analyst with Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “This is not based on fundamentals.”  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
