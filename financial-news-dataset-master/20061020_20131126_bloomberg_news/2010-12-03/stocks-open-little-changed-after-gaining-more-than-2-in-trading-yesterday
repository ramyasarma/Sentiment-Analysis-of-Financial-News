Most U.K. stocks declined, paring the
first weekly advance for the  FTSE 100 Index  in four weeks, after
a report showed an unexpected increase in U.S. unemployment.  Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Plc led bank stocks
lower while Old Mutual Plc paced a retreat among insurers.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  fell 0.2 percent to 5,754.79 at 3:23
p.m. in London as three stocks declined for every two that
gained. The slide trimmed this week’s increase to 1.5 percent.
The  FTSE All-Share Index  lost 0.2 percent today while Ireland’s
 ISEQ Index  slid 0.6 percent.  Stocks erased an earlier advance after payrolls in the
world’s largest economy rose 39,000 last month, less than the
most pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The jobless rate increased to 9.8 percent, the highest
since April.  “The U.S. labor market continues to struggle,” said
 Joshua Raymond , a market strategist at City Index in London.
“The data will inevitably re-raise concerns over the strength
of the U.S. economic recovery.”  The FTSE 100 had rallied 4.3 percent over the past two
days, the biggest two-session increase since May, as the
European Central Bank extended its emergency loan and bond-
buying program and U.S. manufacturing and home sales data
boosted confidence in the economy.  Standard Chartered declined 1.6 percent to 1,835 pence
today as a  gauge  of bank stocks retreated for the first time in
three days. Barclays lost 2.1 percent to 269.1 pence.  Old Mutual, Aviva  Old mutual, the U.K.’s third-largest insurer by market
value, dropped 2 percent to 120.7 pence, snapping two days of
gains. Aviva Plc lost 1.4 percent to 379.8 pence and Legal &
General Group Plc slipped 1 percent to 98.85 pence.  Fresnillo Plc paced advancing shares as silver for
immediate delivery jumped as much as 1.3 percent to $28.9075 an
ounce, after yesterday touching $29.36, the highest level since
Nov. 9.  The stock climbed 3.7 percent to 1,563 pence.  Johnson Matthey Plc, which generates the majority of its
 revenue  from precious metals, climbed 3.2 percent to 1,926
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
