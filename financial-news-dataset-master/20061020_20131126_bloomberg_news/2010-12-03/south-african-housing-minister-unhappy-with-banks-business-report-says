South Africa’s Housing Minister  Tokyo Sexwale  is unhappy with the lending practices of some of the
country’s commercial banks,  Business Report  said, citing
Sexwale.  He is in talks with banks whose lending is said to be
discriminatory, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. Some
banks are not giving enough loans to black people and only give
loans in certain areas and to certain types of people, it said,
citing Sexwale.  Banks and estate agents said they were not aware of any
discriminatory practices, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
