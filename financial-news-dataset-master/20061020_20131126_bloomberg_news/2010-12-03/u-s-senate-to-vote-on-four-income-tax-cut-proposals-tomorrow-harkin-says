The U.S. Senate will vote tomorrow on
four proposals for extending income-tax cuts, two offered by
each party, Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said tonight.  Independent Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut predicted
all four votes will fail. Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of
New Jersey said the votes will help “shape the course” of tax
negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
