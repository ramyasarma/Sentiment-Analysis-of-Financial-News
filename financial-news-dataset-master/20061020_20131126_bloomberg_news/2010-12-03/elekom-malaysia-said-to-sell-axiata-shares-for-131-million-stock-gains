Telekom Malaysia Bhd., the state-
controlled fixed telephone operator, raised 414 million ringgit
($131 million) selling 90 million shares of Axiata Group Bhd.,
two people with knowledge of the transaction said.  The shares were sold at 4.60 ringgit each, said the people
who couldn’t be identified because the information was
confidential. CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. and Credit Suisse Group
AG managed the sale, they said.   Telekom said in a stock exchange filing last night that it
plans to dispose a total of as much as 191.5 million shares in
Axiata through private placements and on the open market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
