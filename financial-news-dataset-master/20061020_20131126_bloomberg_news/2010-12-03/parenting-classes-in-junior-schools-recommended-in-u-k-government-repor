David Cameron ’s government is being
urged to introduce parenting classes in Britain’s junior schools
to improve the prospects of future generations of children.  A government-commissioned report by opposition Labour
lawmaker  Frank Field , published today, also suggested the
publication of “life-chance indicators” to measure how
successful the authorities are in helping poorer children. It
said the government should focus on the first five years of a
child’s life.  The report also proposed spending money on projects aimed
at the under-fives rather than increasing welfare payments. It
said the level of nurture parents provide is more important to a
child’s prospects than their jobs or incomes.  “Later interventions to help poorly performing children
can be effective but, in general, the most effective and cost-
effective way to help and support young families is in the
earliest years of a child’s life,” Field said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
