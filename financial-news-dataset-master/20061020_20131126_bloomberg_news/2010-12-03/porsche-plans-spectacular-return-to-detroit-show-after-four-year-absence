Porsche AG , the sports-car maker
merging with Volkswagen AG, will premiere a “spectacular”
model when it returns to the Detroit auto show in January after
exiting four years ago.  “We’ll have something spectacular to show there,”  Hans- Gerd Bode , a spokesman at the Stuttgart-based carmaker, said in
an interview today. “You’ll have to wait and be surprised.”  Porsche will join VW group presentations beginning Jan. 10
in Detroit that will also include luxury unit Audi and ultra-
luxury brand Bentley Motors Ltd., Bode said.  Porsche, maker of the 911 sports car, last year delivered a
quarter of its 85,903 vehicles to the U.S., its biggest single
market. The manufacturer pulled out of Detroit after 2007 to
focus U.S. activities on Los Angeles. Detroit has been a
mainstay of the North American auto industry for more than a
century and is the largest annual U.S. auto show.  “Porsche’s return demonstrates the relevancy of the
Detroit show for luxury manufacturers,” said  Rebecca Lindland ,
an analyst at IHS Automotive in Lexington, Massachusetts. “They
target a very specific audience with their cars and the U.S.
market is incredibly important for Porsche.”  The company’s U.S.  deliveries  surged 49 percent in November
to 2,416 cars and sport-utility vehicles, the sixth consecutive
month of at least double-digit sales increases. Year-to-date
sales gained 29 percent to 22,753 units.  Shares Climb  Porsche’s preferred shares  rose  as much as 1.96 euros, or 3
percent, to 66.50 euros in Frankfurt trading and were up 2.2
percent as of 2:23 p.m., valuing the company at 11.6 billion
euros (&15.4 billion).  Porsche’s Cayman R mid-engine sports car, which sells in
Europe for 69,830 euros, premiered last month in Los Angeles.
The model, which surges to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in
5 seconds and has a top speed of 282 kilometers per hour, will
hit showrooms next spring, Bode said.  Porsche  took another step this week toward its planned
merger with Volkswagen after the company’s shareholders backed a
5 billion-euro stock sale to lower debt. The sports-car maker
agreed to combine with VW in August 2009 after a failed attempt
by Porsche to gain control of VW.  To contact the reporter on this story:
