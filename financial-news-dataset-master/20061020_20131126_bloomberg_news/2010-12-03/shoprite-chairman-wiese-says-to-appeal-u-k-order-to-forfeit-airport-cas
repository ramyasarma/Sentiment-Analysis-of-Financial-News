Shoprite Holdings Ltd. Chairman
Christo Wiese, who was found with 674,920 pounds in his
possession at London City Airport in April last year, said he
will appeal a ruling to forfeit the cash.  Wiese, who was on his way to chair a board meeting in
Luxembourg when the incident happened, said he was not
arrested and no criminal proceedings have been brought against
him, according to an e-mailed statement today. Wiese has
business interests in both the U.K. and Europe, his statement
said.  “A decision has been taken to appeal the ruling in which
the court made an order for the forfeiture of the money on the
grounds that the decision is legally flawed and unjustified on
the evidence,” Wiese said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
