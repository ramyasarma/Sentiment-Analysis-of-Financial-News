 Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index  retreated 0.5 percent to
24,807.04 by the 12:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according to data

day, adding 1.2 percent to 833.03 at the 5 p.m. close in
Windhoek. The  Ghanaian  market was closed for a holiday.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,

second-biggest lender by market value, dropped 42 kobo, or 3.3
percent, to 12.52 naira, the lowest since Nov. 8.  Guaranty Trust
Bank Plc , the third-biggest lender, lost 2.7 percent, the
steepest drop since Nov. 12, to 16 naira. The lenders led
declines in the Nigeria’s benchmark stocks index as investors
awaited the funding plans of Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria,
a state-owned company set up to buy bad debts from banks.  “The fact that Amcon first has to mobilize funds from the
sale of the bonds means that investors want to wait and see what
will happen,” Chinenyem Anyanwu, chief executive officer of
Dependable Securities Ltd., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by
phone today.  George Williamson Kenya Ltd.  (GWKL KN), a tea grower,
gained for the first day in four, increasing 8 shillings, or 4.8
percent, to 175 shillings. Trading volume of 150,000 was 50
times its three-month average today.  “There were some block trades that pushed up the price,”
 Wycliffe Masinde , a research analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
