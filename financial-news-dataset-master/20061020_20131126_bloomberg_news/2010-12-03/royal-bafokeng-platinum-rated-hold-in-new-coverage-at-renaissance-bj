Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd, a South
African producer of the metal, was rated “hold” with a price
estimate of 68 rand a share in new coverage at Renaissance BJM,
a unit of Moscow-based Renaissance Capital Ltd.  “The company was the target of two pre-listing bids and we
believe potential corporate action will provide a valuable
underpin to its share price,” Johannesburg-based analyst Emma
Townshend wrote in an e-mailed report to clients dated today.
Northam Platinum Ltd. and Aquarius Platinum Ltd. “provide
better near-term growth and are cheaper on relative valuation
multiples,” according to Townshend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
