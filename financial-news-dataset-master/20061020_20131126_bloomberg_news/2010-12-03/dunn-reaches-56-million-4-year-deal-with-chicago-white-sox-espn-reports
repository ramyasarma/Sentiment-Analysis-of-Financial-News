Adam Dunn , a free agent who played
first base with the Washington Nationals, reached agreement on a
$56 million, four-year contract with the Chicago White Sox,  ESPN
reported , citing a person familiar with the negotiations.  Dunn, 31, has hit 282 runs since 2004, second only to
 Albert Pujols  of the St. Louis Cardinals in that time. Last
season, Dunn hit .260 with 38 home runs and 103 runs batted in
with the Nationals.  Chicago, which ended the 2010 season six games behind
Minnesota in the American League Central Division, may put Dunn
in the designated hitter role, ESPN said.  The deal is contingent on Dunn passing a physical
examination today, the sports network said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
