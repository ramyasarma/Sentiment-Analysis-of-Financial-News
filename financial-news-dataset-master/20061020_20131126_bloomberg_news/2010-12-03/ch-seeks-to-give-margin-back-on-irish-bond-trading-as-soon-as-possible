LCH Clearnet Ltd. will reduce the
extra margin it charges for Irish bond trading as yields fall,
using the same criteria it applied when they rose, its head of
fixed income said.  “Our tendency is to give margin back to people as soon as
we reasonably can,” London-based  John Burke  said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “On the way up, it was the fact that
levels were sustained that we were checking. Likewise, in the
reverse, it has to be sustained when it goes below the threshold
on the way down, and it depends on how far below it has gone and
the speed at which it got there.”  LCH increased the deposit it demands of clients for trading
Irish bonds three times last month as yields soared to more than
600 basis points above the Bloomberg Fair Value benchmark of AAA
euro-region sovereign debt. The  yield spread  narrowed to 543
basis points yesterday.  Clearing houses such as LCH guarantee investors’ trades are
completed by standing in the middle of two counterparties, and
raise margin requirements to protect themselves against losses
should one side of the trade fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
