Citigroup Inc. , the bank 11 percent-
owned by U.S. taxpayers, hired former Commerce Secretary  Carlos Gutierrez  as vice chairman of its institutional clients group.  Gutierrez, 57 and born in Havana, joins Citigroup from
Global Political Strategies, a division of Apco Worldwide Inc.,
a Washington-based consulting company, where he was chairman,
Citigroup said today in a statement. Gutierrez will start at the
New York-based bank in January.  He served as Commerce chief under President  George W. Bush 
from 2005 to 2009 after spending almost 30 years with  Kellogg
Co. , the largest U.S. maker of breakfast cereal.  Gutierrez joined the Battle Creek, Michigan-based company
in 1975 as a sales representative and rose to president and
chief executive officer in 1999, becoming the company’s youngest
CEO in its almost 100-year history, according to the statement.
He was named board chairman in April 2000.  Citigroup’s institutional clients group includes the
investment-banking and private-banking businesses. The unit
reported $9 billion in net income for the year through
September. The group’s chief executive officer is  John Havens .  “I am excited to join Citi during an unprecedented time in
the global financial markets,” Gutierrez said in the statement.
“Citi’s full range of local geographic expertise and in-depth
product knowledge is a distinguishing competitive advantage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
