Wheat advanced to a four-month high
in Chicago as Australia cut its export forecast after heavy
rains delayed the harvest and reduced grain quality.  Wheat for March delivery increased for a fifth day, gaining
as much as 2.1 percent to $8.095 a bushel, the highest level for
a most-active contract since Aug. 6, before trading at $8.04 at
10:50 a.m. Singapore time.  Australian output may be 26.8 million metric tons in the
2010-2011 season, compared with a September prediction of 25.1
million tons, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural & Resource
Economics & Sciences forecast today in a report. Exports may be
16 million tons, compared with the previous estimate of 18.4
million tons.  “Less supply from Australia may increase demand for the
U.S. crop,”  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at Tokyo-based
commodity broker Central Shoji Co., said today.  Prices have jumped 68 percent since the end of June as
drought sapped Russian supplies, floods harmed fields in Canada,
and dry weather in the U.S. Great Plains eroded the prospects
for winter crops. The U.S. is  forecast  to be the largest wheat
exporter in the 2010-2011 season, followed by the European
Union, Canada and Australia, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  Lower shipments from Australia may drive wheat prices
higher as the USDA forecast a 22.9 million-ton shortfall in
global output this season, the first deficit in three years.  Crop Downgrade  Wheat-growing areas in eastern Australia may get more rain
this week than the region usually receives in the whole of
December, extending floods that have already damaged crops,  Mike Tannura  at T-Storm Weather said yesterday.  As much as 35 percent, or 5 million tons, of the east-coast
wheat crop could be downgraded to feed quality,  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in
a report on Dec. 5. The bank, which estimates the national crop
at 22.3 million tons, cut its export forecast to 14 million tons
from 16 million tons.  Corn for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $5.70 a bushel,
while soybeans for January delivery were little changed at
$12.8775 a bushel.  Brazil will harvest 66.78 million tons of soybeans in the
year that starts Feb. 1, down from 68.7 million harvested a year
earlier, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday
in a  report . Soybean exports may fall to 30.2 million tons,
compared with 30.5 million a year earlier, the agency said.  Argentina’s soybean output may drop to 52 million tons in
the year starting April 1, from an earlier estimate of 54.5
million tons, the USDA said in a  report . Exports may drop to
11.5 million tons from 14.7 million tons, the report said.  The U.S. is forecast to be the largest soybean supplier in
2010-2011 followed by Brazil and Argentina, according to the
 USDA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
