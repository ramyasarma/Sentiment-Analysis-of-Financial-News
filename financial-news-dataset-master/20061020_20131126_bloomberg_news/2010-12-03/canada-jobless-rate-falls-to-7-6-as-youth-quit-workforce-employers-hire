Canada’s jobless rate fell in
November to the lowest since January 2009, as employment
increased and young people left the labor force.  The  jobless rate  declined to 7.6 percent last month from
7.9 percent in October, and  employment  rose by 15,200 after an
increase of 3,000 in October, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists  forecast  a 7.9 percent unemployment rate and
job growth of 19,800, according to the median estimates of 25
and 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, respectively.  The employment gain was less than half the 40,400 people
aged 15 to 24 who left the workforce, the report said. The youth
participation rate dropped to 63.2 percent, the lowest since
August 1999, from 64.1 percent last month.  “It’s a very fragmented report and there are few places in
it that would give us any reason to celebrate,” said  Sebastien Lavoie , an economist at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal.
“The drop in the unemployment rate comes from youth that have
stopped looking for work to focus on their studies.”  The November report confirms a trend toward slowing job
growth seen since September, so there is no urgency for Bank of
Canada to raise its benchmark lending rate, Lavoie also said.
 Economic growth  slowed to a 1 percent annualized pace in the
third quarter, Statistics Canada said earlier this week, less
than the central bank’s 1.6 percent prediction.  Holding Interest Rates  The central bank has raised its overnight target rate three
times this year to 1 percent and economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News said it will keep it there until at least the
third quarter of 2011, based on the median of 23 estimates.  The Canadian dollar pared gains after the report damped
speculation about future interest-rate increases. The Canadian
currency depreciated 0.1 percent to C$1.0041 per U.S. dollar at
10:06 a.m. in Toronto, after earlier trading at C$1.0003, from
C$1.0026 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 99.59 U.S. cents.  Full-time  employment fell by 11,500 and part-time jobs rose
by 26,700, Statistics Canada said.  Private companies shrank their payrolls by 11,500 and
public sector employment rose by 21,100, Statistics Canada said.  “The details are a little bit softer than the headline
would suggest,” said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian fixed
income and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.
“You could almost put the unemployment rate to one side”
because of the youth figures and declines in full-time and
private employment, he said.  Moderating Growth  Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the report was encouraging, adding that Canadian
economic growth is moderating.  Health care and social assistance workers led the November
job gain with 28,400 new positions, followed by 26,200 jobs in
retail and wholesale trade.  Manufacturing employment fell by 28,600, reducing its share
of total employment to 10 percent, the lowest in figures dating
back to 1976, Statistics Canada said. The industry’s share of
total employment was 15 percent “in the early 2000s and 19
percent in 1976,” the report said.  Payroll  employment  increased by 9,700 positions in
November. Self-employment rose by 5,700.  Average hourly wages advanced 2.2 percent in November from
a year earlier, faster than October’s 2.1 percent pace.  In the U.S., payrolls increased 39,000, less than the most
pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
after a revised 172,000 increase the prior month, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The jobless rate
rose to 9.8 percent, the highest since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
