Corn prices in South Africa, the
continent’s largest producer of the grain, fell as a forecast
for rain in growing areas bolstered the prospects for yields.  The  South African Weather Service  predicted heavy rainfall
across the provinces of Mpumalanga, the biggest producer of
yellow corn, and Free State, where most of the nation’s white-
corn crop is grown.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg, fell 4 rand,
or 0.3 percent, to end trade at 1,369 rand ($198) a metric ton
in Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the country’s
staple food.  Yellow corn for March delivery dropped 5 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,445 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among the
world’s biggest corn exporters.  Wheat for March delivery rose 14 rand, or 0.5 percent, to
2,801 rand a ton.  The gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
following crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
