Saipem SpA , Europe’s largest oil-
field service provider, won an onshore contract worth about C$1
billion ($1 billion) for the Sunrise Energy Project in Canada.  The contract is for the engineering, procurement and
construction of two plants that will produce a total of 60,000
barrels per day of bitumen, Milan-based Saipem said today in a
stock exchange statement.  The contract was awarded by Husky Energy Inc. for the oil
sands project northeast of Fort McMurray, Alberta, according to
Saipem.  BP Plc and Husky agreed this week to start work on the
first phase of the project. They said they planned to award
about C$2 billion in contracts with the first oil scheduled for
2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
