Oil fell in New York as traders sold
contracts to lock in profits after crude surged yesterday to
close at a two-year high on signs fuel demand is climbing as the
global economy improves.  Futures also retraced part of yesterday’s 1.4 percent gain
as  Chinese equities  fell amid speculation the government may
tighten monetary policy further in the world’s biggest energy
user. The U.S. may have added 145,000 non-farm jobs in November,
according to a survey before a report later today, reinforcing
optimism the economy of world’s largest oil consumer continues
to improve.  “Oil is now at the top end of the range,” said Jonathan
Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in
Sydney. “It’s tough resistance here. Oil is coming back a
little bit because of profit taking. The market is going to be
focused on what happens tonight with the unemployment number.”  The January contract declined as much as 42 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $87.58 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $87.82 at 10:22 a.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, it added $1.25 to $88, the highest
settlement since Oct. 8, 2008. Oil has climbed 4.8 percent so
far this week.  Crude gained yesterday as the dollar dropped against the
euro after the European Central Bank said it will keep offering
lenders as much cash as they want through the first quarter.
Prices also climbed as the National Association of Realtors said
yesterday pending home sales increased 10  percent  in October,
bolstering optimism that the economy is improving.  Brent crude oil for January settlement was at $90.55 a
barrel, down 14 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract increased $1.82, or 2.1 percent, to end
the session at $90.69, the highest close since Oct. 1, 2008.  Brent for January is trading at a 3 cent premium to the
February contract, a market situation known as backwardation,
suggesting that prompt supplies are more in demand than later
deliveries. This is the first time it has occurred since April
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
