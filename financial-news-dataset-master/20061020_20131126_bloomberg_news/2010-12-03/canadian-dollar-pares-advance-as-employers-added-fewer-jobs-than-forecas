Canada’s dollar dropped against all
of its major counterparts as reports showed the nation gained
fewer jobs in November than economists forecast and the U.S.
unemployment rate unexpectedly increased.  “We’re seeing the Canadian dollar being punished on the
U.S.-economic association, given the much worse than expected
payrolls data,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist in Toronto
at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote via e-mail.
“The Canadian jobs data was also weak, but the market held
judgment until the U.S. numbers came in. Definitely Canadian
dollar-negative.”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is also known, depreciated
0.1 percent to C$1.0039 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto,
from C$1.0026 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 99.61 U.S.
cents. The Canadian dollar slid 1.7 percent to 82.21 yen.  Canada’s currency posted its first weekly gain against the
greenback since Nov. 5, rising 1.7 percent. Futures on crude
oil, the nation’s biggest export, rallied 1.6 percent to $89.41
a barrel.  Traders pared bets on the prospect for an increase in
interest rates after the jobs reports. Yields on the March 2011
bankers’ acceptances contract, a gauge of expectations for
short-term borrowing costs, dropped today six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.45 percent. The yields ended last
week at 1.53 percent.  ‘Much Weaker’  “The much weaker than anticipated U.S. employment data has
really put a bid into the market,”  David Love , a trader of
interest-rate derivatives in Montreal at the brokerage Le Groupe
Jitney Inc., said by e-mail, referring to a rise in the
contract’s price, which moves inversely to the yield. “There’s
still a little room to the upside, but we’re getting close to
resistance levels.” Resistance denotes the upper boundary of a
trading range.  So-called Bax contracts  average  about 20 basis points above
the central bank’s overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992
show. Hedge funds and money managers use the contracts to hedge
against interest-rate exposure and make bets.  Citing a weaker U.S. outlook, the  Bank of Canada  held its
main policy rate at 1 percent in October after three successive
increases of a quarter-percentage point beginning June 1. Policy
makers will keep the rate steady when they meet Dec. 7,
according to all 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Government Bonds  The yield on Canada’s 10-year government  bonds  was fell 2
basis points to 3.18 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 rose 13 cents to C$102.58. The
yield touched 3.25 percent yesterday, the highest level since
July 28.  Ten-year bonds yielded 18 basis points more than the
equivalent-maturity U.S. security. The yield  advantage  has
narrowed from 37 basis points on Oct. 7, which was the most
since January 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  Canadian employers added 15,200  jobs  in November after an
increase of 3,000 in the previous month, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. The median forecast of 24 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 19,800. The unemployment
rate unexpectedly dropped to 7.6 percent from 7.9 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by 39,000, less than the most
pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
after a revised 172,000 advance in the prior month, Labor
Department figures showed. The jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent,
the highest level since April.  The loonie had yesterday its biggest two-day rally against
its U.S. counterpart since May as a gain in stocks and
commodities boosted assets related to economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
