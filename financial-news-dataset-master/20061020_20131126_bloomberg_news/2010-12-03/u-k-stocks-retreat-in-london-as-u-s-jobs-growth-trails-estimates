U.K. stocks dropped after a U.S.
Labor Department report showed employers added fewer jobs than
forecast in November and the unemployment rate unexpectedly
rose.  The FTSE 100 Index declined 0.7 percent to 5,725.14 at 1:33
p.m. in London. The gauge earlier rose as much as 0.3 percent.  Payrolls increased 39,000, less than the most pessimistic
projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, after a
revised 172,000 increase the prior month, the report showed. The
jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent, the highest since April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
