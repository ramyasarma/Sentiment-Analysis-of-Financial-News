New York Jets starting safety  Jim Leonhard  won’t play in the Dec. 6 game against the New England
Patriots after injuring his leg during practice.  Leonhard, 28, hurt his shin today during drills at the
Jets’ practice facility in Florham Park, New Jersey, team
spokesman  Bruce Speight  said in a telephone interview.  Leonhard is in his sixth year in the National Football
League and second with the Jets, who have allowed the third-
fewest yards in the league this season. He has 61 tackles and
one interception through 11 games.  Brodney Pool , a six-year veteran, most likely will start at
safety in Leonhard’s place, Speight said.  The 9-2 Jets travel to Foxboro, Massachusetts, to play the
9-2 division-rival Patriots. The Jets beat the Patriots 28-14 at
New Meadowlands Stadium in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
