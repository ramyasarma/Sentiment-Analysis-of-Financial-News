Etisalat Nigeria won’t bid for Multi-
Links, the loss-making CDMA-technology mobile-phone business
owned by  Telkom South Africa Ltd. , said Chief Executive Officer
Steven Evans.  “We’re not at all interested in a CDMA business, frankly
we don’t see the future in that technology,” he said in a phone
interview today. Etisalat Nigeria is 40 percent owned by
 Emirates Telecom Corp. , the United Arab Emirates’ largest phone
company. CDMA, or code division multiple access, is the
fundamental radio technology used in data phones and networks.  Johannesburg-based Business Report newspaper said yesterday
Telkom is in talks to sell the mobile phone unit to Etisalat,
citing a letter from a Multi-Links executive it didn’t identify.
Telkom plans to exit the unit in the next six months, the
company said on Nov. 22, at a cost of as much as $180 million.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “has been appointed by Telkom to
look at the different options that they have for Multi-Links,”
Evans said. The bank “approached a raft of different people,
including  Etisalat Nigeria , to talk with us about whether we
were interested,” he said.  A 50 percent cut in tariffs announced by Bharti Airtel
Ltd.’s Nigerian unit on Dec. 1 brings the company’s tariffs
closer to those charged by competitors, Evans said.  Bharti entered Africa’s largest mobile-phone market with
the acquisition in June of the African assets of Zain, Kuwait’s
largest phone operator, for $9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
