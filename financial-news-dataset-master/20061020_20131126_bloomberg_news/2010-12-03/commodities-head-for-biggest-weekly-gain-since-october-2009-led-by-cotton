Commodities headed for the biggest
weekly gain since October 2009 as global shortfalls of cotton
and wheat drove agriculture prices higher.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  raw materials 
rose 3.25, or 1 percent, to 315.35 at 1:31 p.m. New York time. A
close at that level would mark a weekly gain of 4.7 percent.  Cotton was poised for the biggest weekly jump in 39 years
after India put limits on exports. Heavy rain is eroding the
quality of Australian wheat after a drought cut Russian grain
output. The  dollar  tumbled against major currencies, boosting
the investment appeal of energy, metals and crops. Crude oil
rose to a 25-month high, and gold topped $1,400 an ounce.  “The perfect storm in commodities continues another
week,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodity brokerage in Medford, Oregon. “Between
weather problems, financial problems and China saying they want
to buy gold, all these markets are up pretty good today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
