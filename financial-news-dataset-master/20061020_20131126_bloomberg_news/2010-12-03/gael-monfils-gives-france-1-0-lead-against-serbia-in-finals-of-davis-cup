Serbia’s  Novak Djokovic  defeated
 Giles Simon  of France in straight sets to leave the Davis Cup
final tied 1-1 after the opening day.  The third-ranked Djokovic beat the 42nd-ranked Simon 6-3,
6-1, 7-5 in front of a sellout crowd of 17,000 in the Belgrade
Arena in the Serbian capital.  France has won the Davis Cup nine times since it started as
a team competition between the U.S. and Great Britain in 1900.
Serbia has never won the title and is playing in its first final.  Earlier today, world No. 12  Gael Monfils  had won the first
point for France with a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 victory over  Janko
Tipsarevic , who is ranked 37 places lower on the ATP World Tour.  Serbia’s  Nenad Zimonjic  will play France’s  Arnaud Clement  and  Michael Llodra  in the doubles tomorrow. The reverse
singles matches will follow in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
