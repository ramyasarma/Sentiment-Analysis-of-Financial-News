Russia will balance its  budge t  next
year, four years earlier than the government estimates, and post
a surplus in 2012 as oil prices “move sharply higher,” Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said.  The economy of the world’s biggest energy supplier will
grow 5.3 percent next year and 5.6 percent in 2012,  Clemens Grafe,  a Moscow-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said today in
an e-mailed report. Annual  inflation  will accelerate to 8.7
percent by July before slowing to 7 percent in the second half,
the bank said.  “We expect Russia to see a year of two halves,” Grafe
wrote. “The key game changers in the course of the year will be
higher oil prices, some clarification on hydrocarbon policies
and eventually more clarity on the future political
leadership.”  Oil futures traded in New York will average $100 a barrel
next year and $110 a barrel in 2012, according to Goldman. Oil
for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as
much as 33 cents to $88.33, the highest price since Nov. 11, on
speculation U.S. fuel demand will increase as the economic
recovery gathers pace in the world’s biggest oil consumer. The
January contract closed at $88 a barrel yesterday, the highest
since October 2008.  Budget Deficit  The Russian government expects the budget to remain in
deficit through 2014 based on an average price for Urals crude,
Russia’s chief export blend, of $75 a barrel this year and 2011
and $78 in 2012.  Russia’s budget deficit was 5.9 percent of gross domestic
product last year, it’s first since 1999. The shortfall will
narrow to about 4.6 percent this year, according to Finance
Minister  Alexei Kudrin .  Annual inflation will probably slow to between 6.5 percent
and 7 percent next year, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach 
said Nov. 30 in an interview in London. He also forecast a
“slight acceleration” in the pace of economic growth to as
much as 4.2 percent in 2011 from about 3.8 percent this year.  Oil and natural gas account for about 25 percent of
Russia’s GDP, according to Kudrin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
