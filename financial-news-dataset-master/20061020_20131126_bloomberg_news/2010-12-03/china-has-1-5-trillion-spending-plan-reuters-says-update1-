China may spend as much as $1.5
trillion on seven strategic industries over the next five years,
Reuters reported, citing an unidentified source with direct
knowledge of the matter.  The nation may invest 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion)
annually in the alternative energy, biotechnology, information
technology, high-end equipment manufacturing, advanced materials,
alternative-fuel cars and energy-efficient and environmental
technology industries, Reuters said yesterday.  No comment was immediately available from the National
Development and Reform Commission, the planning agency, today.  Targeting key industries will help to support investment
growth even as spending on infrastructure slows because of the
end of a stimulus program, UBS AG. said in a report this week.
The favored sectors may get easier access to credit and land and
swifter project approvals than other ventures, Beijing-based
economist  Wang Tao  said.  Investment growth “will continue to remain robust,” Wang
said, also citing government plans to develop inland regions.  UBS sees China posting economic growth of 9 percent next
year after an estimated 10 percent expansion in 2010.  China’s leaders will consider the investment plan at this
month’s Central Economic Work Conference, according to Reuters.  The  Warren Buffett-invested  carmaker BYD Co. and wind
turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. are
companies in the named industries.  -- Li Yanping ,  Paul Panckhurst . Editors: Paul Panckhurst,  Lily Nonomiya .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
