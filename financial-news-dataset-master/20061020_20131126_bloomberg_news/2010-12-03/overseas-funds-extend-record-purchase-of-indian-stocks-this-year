Overseas  investors  purchased a net
 4.63 billion rupees  ($102.1 million) of Indian shares yesterday,
taking this year’s record inflows in equity to 1.333 trillion
rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India said.  Investors bought 41.27 billion rupees of shares and sold
36.63 billion rupees,  data  from the market regulator showed.
They sold a net 97 million rupees of bonds, reducing their debt
purchases this year to 445.5 billion rupees. Stock purchases
this year include 382 billion rupees from the primary market.  Foreign  investors  have placed 4.47 trillion rupees in
equities and 768.1 billion rupees in bonds since they were
allowed into the country in 1993, today’s report showed. The
previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2 billion
rupees, sparking the biggest rally in 18 years. Funds withdrew a
record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008, setting off the
worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
