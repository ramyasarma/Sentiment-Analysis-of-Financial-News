Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the Fed’s decision to purchase $600 billion in
Treasury securities and didn’t rule out expanding the program,
in an interview for CBS television’s “60 Minutes,” the network
said.  “He explains why the Fed announced its intention to buy
$600 billion in Treasury securities, defending against charges
the move will lead to inflation and not ruling out the purchase
of more,” according to a press release today from CBS.  The interview with CBS journalist  Scott Pelley  was filmed
Nov. 30 in Columbus, Ohio and will air Dec. 5.  At its Nov. 3 meeting in Washington, the Fed announced the
program to purchase about $75 billion a month of Treasury
securities through June. The Fed’s  Open Market Committee  said it
would “regularly review the pace of its securities purchases
and the overall size of the asset-purchase program.”  Republican leaders criticized the second round of so-called
quantitative easing last month, where the Fed attempts to
provide additional monetary stimulus by purchasing Treasury
debt. The Fed’s  benchmark lending rate  has been in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The news show’s website previously stated that Bernanke
will discuss “pressing economic issues” such as U.S.
unemployment, the federal deficit and the central bank’s
decision last month to purchase an additional $600 billion in
U.S. Treasury bonds.  Bernanke also appeared on “60 Minutes” in March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
