Canada’s provinces are poised for
record domestic issuance this year as governments take advantage
of stronger risk appetite among foreign investors to lock in
longer-term borrowing at two-decade-low costs.  The 10 provinces sold C$48.3 billion ($48.2 billion) of
debt in the first 11 months of 2010, up 9 percent from last year
and about C$1 billion away from the most ever, according to
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Ontario, the nation’s
largest province, has issued about C$22 billion in Canadian-
dollar debt this year.  Provincial treasurers are sticking to the domestic market
to raise funds as foreign investors pile into Canada’s fixed-
income market, lured by the relative soundness of its economy
versus other Group of Seven nations. Provinces didn’t issue any
foreign-currency bonds in October and November, the first two-
month stretch of all-domestic borrowing for almost three years,
CIBC data show.  “Greater demand from non-residents, or the offshore bid,
has been a factor,”  David DesLauriers , managing director of
government finance at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by phone from
Toronto. “They have been participating in the provincial sector
in greater amounts this year compared to last year.”  Sales of 30-year bonds more than doubled so far this year
to C$18.2 billion, from C$7.8 billion in 2009, as issuers seek
to take advantage of the low-interest- rate  environment for as
long as possible to ensure low refinancing risks, and as
investors become more comfortable with risk, DesLauriers said.  Lowest Level  Average yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Canadian Provincial and Municipal Index, which tracks 397 bonds
with a par value of C$468 billion, reached 2.9 percent on Oct.
19, the lowest level since at least 1992.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own the debt of Canadian corporations rather than the
federal government tightened yesterday to 142 basis points, or
1.42 percentage points, from 144 the day before, according to a
separate Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Yields rose to
4.02 percent, from 4.01 percent the day before, when they rose
above 4 percent for the first time since July.  The securities lost 0.85 percent in November as a drop in
bond prices drove yields to 3.91 percent on average, from 3.64
percent on Oct. 31.  Shaw Communications Inc.  paid 330 basis points over
benchmarks to sell C$400 million of 6.75 percent bonds due in
November 2039, and 230 basis points over benchmarks on C$500
million of 5.5 percent bonds due in December 2020. Calgary-based
Shaw won regulatory approval in October for its C$2 billion
purchase of Canwest Global Communications Corp.’s television
assets.  Terasen Bonds  Terasen Gas Inc., the Surrey, British Columbia-based
natural gas supplier, sold C$100 million of 5.2 percent bonds
maturing in December 2040. The debt priced to yield 160 basis
points over federal benchmarks.  In the provincial bond market, relative yields held steady
yesterday at 53 basis points. Yields rose to 3.28 percent, from
3.25 percent the day before. The securities lost 1.2 percent in
November, the biggest loss since December 2009.  Quebec Finance Minister  Raymond Bachand  said yesterday the
province’s cumulative budget deficit through 2013-14 will be
C$500 million lower than projected earlier this year. Bachand,
who was speaking at a press conference in Quebec City, also said
the 2010-11 deficit for Canada’s second-most populous province
is now projected to be C$4.6 billion, higher than the C$4.5
billion previously estimated. Quebec raised its budget
contingency for the year to C$400 million from C$300 million.  ‘Under Control’  “The government is managing the situation and continues to
keep its spending under control,” Bachand said. “We’re going
in the right direction and we’re staying the course.”  The minister also said the 2011-12 deficit will be C$3.2
billion, compared with a C$2.9 billion projection in March. The
2009-10 deficit is estimated at C$3.2 billion, C$1.1 billion
less than earlier projected. The province’s borrowing
requirement for this fiscal year was raised by C$1.9 billion.  Ontario cut its deficit forecast for the currency fiscal
year by C$1 billion. The province will run a deficit  of C$18.7
billion in the current fiscal year, down from a June forecast of
C$19.7 billion, Finance Minister  Dwight Duncan  said on Nov. 18.
Ontario will have budget gaps of C$17.3 billion in 2011-12 and
C$15.9 billion in 2012-13 and a balanced budget in seven years.  Borrowing Needs  The province’s long-term public borrowing needs are
forecast to fall to C$38.7 billion in the latest outlook, down
C$1 billion from the March budget. Borrowing requirements will
be C$38.8 billion and C$40.2 billion in the next two years,
according to financial documents.  “When we look out to the 2011-12 borrowing year for the
provinces, we don’t see a tremendous drop but I don’t see a big
increase either,” said TD’s DesLauriers. “If I had to guess,
Ontario would probably be a little lower. That might be offset
by slightly higher amounts in some of the other provinces.”  The yield on Canada’s 10-year government  bonds  dropped for
the first time in three days, falling six basis points to 3.14
percent. The benchmark’s yield is up three basis points this
week. The price of the 3.5 percent security due in June 2020
rose 46 cents today to C$102.91.  Canada’s 10-year bonds yielded 23 basis points more than
the equivalent maturity U.S. security. The so-called yield
 advantage  in Canada’s favor has declined from 37 basis points on
Oct. 7, which was the most since January 2009, according to
Bloomberg data.  Payrolls  Government bonds had their worst month of the year in
November, down 1 percent, compared with a drop of about 0.7
percent for Treasuries.  Canada’s dollar weakened today by as much as 0.6 percent to
C$1.0081 per U.S. dollar after a pair of employment reports
dimmed prospects for a Bank of Canada interest-rate increase
early next year.  Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa that employers added
15,200 jobs in November after an increase of 3,000 in the
previous month. The median forecast of 24 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 19,800. The jobless rate
unexpectedly dropped to 7.6 percent from 7.9 percent.  U.S. payrolls increased by 39,000 last month, the Labor
Department said today in Washington, trailing the median
economist estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for an increase of
150,000 jobs. The jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent from 9.6
percent.  Provincial Bonds Up  Provincial bonds are up 7.1 percent this year, on track for
the strongest returns since 2005, as international investors
purchase Canadian debt securities at a  record pace .  Combined domestic and international provincial issuance is
C$67.5 billion so far this year and may reach C$75 billion,
matching last year’s pace, DesLauriers said.  “With demand for high quality Canadian-dollar paper so
strong, provinces have skewed their issuance to the domestic
market of late,”  Warren Lovely , a governments strategist at
CIBC World Markets, wrote in an e-mail. “We’ll see a return of
international issuance soon enough, but Ontario for one will end
up completing more of its program in the reliably cost-effective
Canadian dollar market than it did last year.”  Provincial issuance will likely climb to about C$75 billion
in the fiscal year beginning April 1, from C$73 billion in the
current fiscal year, Lovely estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
