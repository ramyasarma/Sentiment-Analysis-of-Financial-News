U.S. Supreme Court  Justice  Clarence Thomas ’s wife, Virginia, is stepping down as the head of
Liberty Central, the nonprofit group she founded to support the
Tea Party movement.  She “will continue to play an influential role as a
consultant” to the group, which will be joining forces with
another grassroots organization, the Patrick Henry Center for
Individual Liberty, according to a press  release  issued by the
two groups today.  Virginia Thomas  was in the news in October after she
telephoned  Anita Hill , the woman whose sexual harassment
allegations almost derailed her husband’s 1991 Supreme Court
nomination, and asked for an apology.  In an  interview  with the Daily Caller website published
today, Thomas said the phone call is “a private matter” and
“was probably a mistake on my part.”  Thomas’s work with Liberty Central, along with her
husband’s role on the Supreme Court, also triggered questions.
In October she asked to have her name removed from a memo that
called President  Barack Obama ’s health-care overhaul
“unconstitutional,” distancing herself from an issue that may
come before the high court.  Gary Aldrich, the founder of the Manassas, Virginia-based
Patrick Henry Center, will run the combined organization, the
groups said. The Patrick Henry Center advocates for limited
government, individual liberty and low taxes, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
