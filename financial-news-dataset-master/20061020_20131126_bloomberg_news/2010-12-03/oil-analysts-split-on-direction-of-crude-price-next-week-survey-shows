Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
were split over the direction of crude oil prices next week amid
signals the U.S. economic recovery is accelerating while
stockpiles climb.  Ten of 28 analysts, or 36 percent, forecast crude will
advance through Dec. 10. Ten more respondents predicted that
futures will be steady. Eight said there will be a decline. Last
week, 42 percent of analysts expected the market to be little
changed.  The number of Americans signing contacts to buy previously
owned homes increased a record 10  percent  in October, the
National Association of Realtors said yesterday in Washington.
The number of applications for jobless benefits  averaged  431,000
a week over the month ended Nov. 27, the lowest level since
August 2008, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  “The U.S. does look like it’s improving, I feel that it’s
on the road to recovery,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “The
fundamental picture also shows that we’re still getting an
increase in inventories.”  U.S. crude oil  supplies  increased 1.07 million barrels to
359.7 million in the week ended Nov. 26, an Energy Department
report showed Dec. 1.  Stockpiles  at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for New York futures, increased 910,000 barrels
to 34.5 million.  Crude oil futures for January delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange have surged $4.24, or 5.1 percent, to $88 a
barrel so far this week. Prices are up 15 percent from a year
ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
