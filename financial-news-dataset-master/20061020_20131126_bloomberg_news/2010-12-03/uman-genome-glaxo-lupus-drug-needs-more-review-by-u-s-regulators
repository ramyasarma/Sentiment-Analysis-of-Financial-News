Human Genome Sciences Inc.  and
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s Benlysta, the first new treatment for
lupus in 52 years, needs more review by U.S. regulators before
it may be approved for sale.  The Food and Drug Administration extended the deadline for
a decision on Benlysta by three months, to March 10, the
companies said today in a statement. Human Genome, based in
Rockville, Maryland, submitted additional information to the
agency after an advisory panel voted 13-2 in support of the drug
at a Nov. 16 meeting, according to the statement.  Michael Yee , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San
Francisco, said Dec. 1 that a delayed decision was likely given
the timing of the advisory panel. Benlysta was given a six-month
 expedited review  under an FDA program designed to speed access
to novel medicines. If approved, sales of the medicine may
exceed $2.1 billion by 2014, according to the average  estimate 
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  About 5 million people worldwide, including 1.5 million
Americans, have  lupus . Benlysta prevents the production of
antibodies that attack healthy cells, causing swelling, joint
and muscle pain, rashes and fever.  Human Genome fell $1, or 3.9 percent, to $24.60 in extended
 trading  on the Nasdaq Stock Market. American depositary receipts
of London-based Glaxo, each representing two ordinary shares,
dropped 2 cents, to $39.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
