Tiger Woods  is atop a leaderboard for
the second time this year after a 7-under-par 65 during the
first round of golf’s Chevron World Challenge.  Woods, whose foundation hosts the tournament, had eight
birdies before closing with a bogey at Sherwood Country Club in
Thousand Oaks, California. He leads by one stroke over U.S. Open
champion  Graeme McDowell  and  Rory McIlroy .  The only other time Woods led a tournament this year was in
August at The Barclays, where he also opened with a 65 before
tying for 12th in the U.S. PGA Tour’s first playoff event. Woods
went winless this season for the first time in 14 years as a
professional.  Woods is a four-time winner at the Chevron World Challenge,
an unofficial event that has a $1.2 million top prize and
features a field of 18 players selected from the top 50 in the
world rankings.  Woods last won at the Australian Masters 13 months ago and
his 281-week run as world No. 1 ended on Nov. 1, when  Lee Westwood  replaced him atop the rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
