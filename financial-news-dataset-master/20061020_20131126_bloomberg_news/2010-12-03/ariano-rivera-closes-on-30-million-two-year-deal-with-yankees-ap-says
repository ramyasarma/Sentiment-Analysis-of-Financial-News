Pitcher  Mariano Rivera  is close to
reaching agreement on a $30 million two-year contract with the
New York Yankees, the Associated Press reported, citing a person
familiar with the negotiations.  “You can be pretty confident in Mo,” Yankees Co-Chairman
 Hank Steinbrenner  told AP. “We’re looking good.”  The 41-year-old Rivera had 33 saves last season to take his
total in 16 years with the Yankees to 559, the second-most in
Major League Baseball history after Trevor Hoffman’s 601.  To contact the reporter on this story:
