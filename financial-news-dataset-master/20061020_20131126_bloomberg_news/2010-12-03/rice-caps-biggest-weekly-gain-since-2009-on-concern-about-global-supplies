Rice futures rose, capping the
biggest weekly gain since 2009, on concern that global demand
will outpace supplies as adverse weather cuts production in Asia
and the U.S.  The main crop in Thailand, the world’s biggest exporter,
may drop 7 percent this year after floods, according to the
country’s agriculture minister. The United Nations this week cut
its global-output forecast. The quality of rice from  Arkansas ,
the biggest U.S. producing state, has deteriorated because of
dry weather, said Milo Hamilton, the president of
Firstgrain.com, an advisory service in Austin, Texas.  “There are little negative-production changes happening in
rice all over the place,” Hamilton said. “We’ve just had a lot
of dings all over the world.”  Rice futures for January delivery rose 23 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $14.67 per 100 pounds at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices jumped 9.4 percent this week, the
biggest such gain for a most-active contract since March 2009.  World rough-rice production may drop to 697.9 million
metric tons, the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization said on
Nov. 30. That’s 6.5 million tons lower than the agency’s
forecast in June. Prices may triple in 18 months as supplies
shrink and demand increases, Ed Peter, the chief executive
officer of Duxton Asset Management Pte., said this week.  Smaller Thai Crop  In Thailand, production may decline to 21.66 million tons,
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Theera Wongsamut said last
week in an interview. That’s 3 percent smaller than the
government’s Nov. 9 forecast. The worst floods in 50 years
inundated about 15 percent of the country’s rice land, Theera
said.  In the U.S.,  exporters  sold 122,427 tons of rice in the
week ended Nov. 25, the most in two months, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. Last month, the USDA cut its
forecast for domestic production by 0.3 percent to 241.6 billion
pounds. The agency will update its estimates on Dec. 10.  A decline by the dollar supported rice futures, Hamilton
said. The  greenback  was headed for the biggest drop in five
months against a basket of major currencies, enhancing the
appeal of U.S. exports.  Indonesia said yesterday that it agreed to buy 230,000
metric tons of Thai rice, bringing the country’s imports this
year to 830,000 tons. Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest
economy, returned to the rice market this year after two years
of self-sufficiency, as production growth eased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
