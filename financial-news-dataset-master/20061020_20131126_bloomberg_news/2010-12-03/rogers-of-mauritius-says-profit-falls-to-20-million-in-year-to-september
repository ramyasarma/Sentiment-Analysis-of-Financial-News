Rogers & Co. , a Mauritian company
with interests in tourism, aviation and construction, said
profit for the year through September fell 5 percent on wider
losses at its hotels unit.  Net income declined to 620.2 million rupees ($20.3 million)
from 652.3 million rupees a year earlier, the company said in a
statement e-mailed by the Port Louis-based Stock Exchange of
Mauritius today. Revenue advanced to 9.51 billion rupees
compared with 8.64 billion rupees in the prior period.  “The performance of the hotels sector and global
businesses were affected by the weak conditions and a strong
Mauritian rupee,” the company said. “However, the domestic-
oriented sectors reported improved results with the relative
strength of the local economy.”  An economic crisis in Europe, the source of two-thirds of
the Indian Ocean island nation’s tourists, and a firmer rupee
have hurt tourism and damped exports. The rupee gained about 10
percent against the euro in the 12 months through September.  The hotel unit’s net loss widened to 278 million rupees
from 127 million rupees a year earlier, Rogers said.  The company has “better prospects” in the next financial
year, with all its hotels being operational and because of an
expected increase in tourism arrivals, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
