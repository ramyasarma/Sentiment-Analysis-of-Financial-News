Royal Bank of Canada  said fourth-
quarter profit unexpectedly fell, missing analysts’ expectations
for the fifth-straight period, while smaller rival Bank of Nova
Scotia reported earnings that topped estimates.  Royal Bank, the country’s largest bank by assets, said
profit for the period ended Oct. 31 dropped 9.4 percent to
C$1.12 billion ($1.12 billion), or 74 cents a share.  Scotiabank ,
the third-largest bank, said profit climbed 21 percent to C$1.09
billion, or C$1 a share.  Rising costs for compensation and marketing and falling
trading revenue reduced profit at Royal Bank as well as
competitors Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce last quarter. Royal Bank’s trading income plunged by
half, while its international unit posted its 10th-straight
quarterly loss.  “This strikes me as a pretty big miss,” said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research at MacDougall MacDougall &
MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which manages about C$4 billion
including banks.  Royal Bank, the  worst-performing  Canadian bank stock this
year, fell C$2.47, or 4.4 percent, to C$53.25 in 4 p.m. trading
on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since May 2009.
Scotiabank rose C$1.66, or 3.1 percent, to C$55.63, the biggest
gain in more than 14 months.  Adjusted earnings at Royal Bank were 84 cents a share,
trailing the C$1.01 a share average  estimate  of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Significant Pressure  The Toronto-based lender will face “significant pressure”
with the results, said  John Aiken , an analyst at Barclays
Capital. “The market will once again have to reset its
expectations for the bank,” he said in a note today.  Royal Bank set aside C$432 million for bad loans, about
half the amount from a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose
5.9 percent to C$3.8 billion.  Earnings from the  RBC Capital Markets  unit fell 34 percent
to C$373 million from C$561 million a year earlier on declines
in sales and trading. Trading revenue across the bank fell 48
percent to C$656 million. Canadian consumer banking earnings
rose 6.7 percent to C$765 million.  International banking, which includes Raleigh, North
Carolina-based RBC Bank, posted a loss of C$157 million. The
unit may post quarterly profits in fiscal 2011, said  James Westlake , who oversees the unit.  Tweaked Goals  Chief Executive Officer  Gordon Nixon  said he tweaked his
bank’s goals for 2011 to be an “undisputed leader” of
financial services in Canada and a “leading provider” of
capital markets and wealth-management services globally. Last
year, the bank’s goals included growth in U.S. consumer and
commercial banking.  “Our aspiration is not to build a global retail banking
operation,” Nixon said today in a conference call. “If you
look at what we’re going to do in China and India and South
America and Europe, it’s going to be geared towards wealth
management and capital markets.”  Insurance profit fell 74 percent to C$27 million, led by a
C$116 million loss from the October sale of its U.S. unit,
Liberty Life Insurance. Wealth management earnings rose 8.7
percent to C$175 million from a year earlier. Royal Bank said it
had net income of C$5.22 billion for the year, up 35 percent
driven by record earnings in Canadian banking.  Scotiabank said profit from domestic consumer banking,
which includes asset management, climbed 13 percent to C$567
million because of higher revenue from mutual funds and other
products. Scotiabank will report asset management as a separate
unit beginning next quarter, after the lender announced last
week it plans to buy DundeeWealth Corp. for about C$2.3 billion.  Asset Management  Expanding in asset management is “where they wanted to go
for a long, long time,” said  John Kinsey , who helps manage C$1
billion at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. “Now they’re
going to take the gloves off and just get at it.”  International banking, which includes operations in about
50 countries including Mexico, Thailand and Peru, climbed 28
percent to C$363 million, led by a recent  acquisition  in Puerto
Rico and growth in Chile and the Caribbean. Investment-banking
profit dropped 23 percent to C$273 million.  “While not a stand-out quarter, relative to what we have
seen from the Big 5 banks that have reported to date, Scotia’s
results will likely be very well received,” Aiken said today.  The bank set aside C$254 million for loan-loss provisions,
a 39 percent decline from a year ago. Before one-time items,
Scotiabank said it earned C$1.02 a share. That beat the C$1-a-
share average  estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Record Year  Scotiabank also increased its dividend payout ratio to a
range of 40 percent to 50 percent of profit, Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Waugh  said on a conference call. Waugh said the
move allows the bank more “flexibility” in paying dividends.
The previous range was 35 percent to 45 percent of earnings.  For the full year, Scotiabank earned a record C$4.24
billion, or C$3.91 a share. The lender said today it expects
earnings per share growth of 7 percent to 12 percent in 2011,
and a return on equity of 16 percent to 20 percent.  Bank of Montreal, the fourth-largest lender, will be the
last of Canada’s six largest banks to release earnings Dec. 7.
