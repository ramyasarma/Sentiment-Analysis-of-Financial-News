Oil will advance to $120 a barrel
before the end of 2012 as consumption grows in emerging
economies, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is
responsible for about 40 percent of global supplies, is unlikely
to increase production in the first half of next year unless
prices surge through $100 a barrel, the bank said in a report
today. Futures traded around $87 a barrel in New York today,
near their highest price in two years.  “Strong emerging oil demand growth over the next 24 months
is very likely to lift the call on OPEC production to levels
last seen at the peak of the oil price spike in 2008,” analysts
led by  Lawrence Eagles  in New York said. “We expect oil
inventories to continue their drawing trend over the first
quarter.”  JPMorgan boosted 2011 price forecasts for oil contracts in
New York and London. West Texas Intermediate on the New York
Mercantile Exchange will average $93 a barrel next year, up 3.6
percent from a previous estimate of $89.75, it said. Brent crude
traded in London will average $95 a barrel next year, up from an
earlier assessment of $91.75.  The bank said the North Sea benchmark, used to price two-
thirds of global crude, will average $105 in 2012. It expects
futures to reach $100 a barrel in the first half of 2011.  Brent crude for next month is trading at a 4-cent premium
to the February future, a price situation known as backwardation
that suggests immediate supplies are more in demand than later
deliveries. This is a “structure that is likely to remain in
place for much of 2011 and 2012,” JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
