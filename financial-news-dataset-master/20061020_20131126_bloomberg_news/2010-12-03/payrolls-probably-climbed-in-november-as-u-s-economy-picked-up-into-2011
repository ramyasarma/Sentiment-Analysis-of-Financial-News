An increase in November payrolls
probably pushed U.S. job gains past the 1 million mark for the
year as the world’s largest economy strengthened heading into
2011, economists said before a report today.  Employment increased by 150,000 last month, according to
the median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
bringing the rise so far this year to 1.02 million. The advances
haven’t been large enough to bring down  unemployment , which held
at 9.6 percent, according to the survey median.  Another report may show service industries, which account
for almost 90 percent of the economy, grew last month at the
fastest pace since May as more jobs and rising wages boosted
holiday sales at retailers like  J.C. Penney Co.  and  Gap Inc.  At
the same time, the Federal Reserve is concerned joblessness will
be slow to retreat, explaining why policy makers announced a new
round of monetary stimulus.  “A lot of the hiring we expect to see is from the smaller,
newer firms,” said  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond
James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. “The
outlook that we’re seeing in the near term is really not enough
to push the unemployment rate down.”  The Labor Department’s report is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
Washington time. Estimates for payroll gains ranged from 75,000
to 200,000. Last month’s projected increase would be in line
with the 151,000 workers employers added in October.  Employment Strengthening  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, rose
by 158,000 last month after a 159,000 October gain, the survey
showed. A similar increase in December would make the fourth
quarter the strongest for employment this year, evidence the
recovery is picking up. Such payrolls rose by 122,000 a month on
average in the third quarter, by 118,000 in the second and by
79,000 in the first.  Economists’  projections  for the jobless rate, which has
been at 9.6 percent since August, varied from 9.4 percent to 9.7
percent. November would be the 16th month of joblessness at 9.5
percent or higher, the longest such stretch since records began
in 1948.  Job losses in 2008 and 2009 totaled 8.4 million, pushing
unemployment up from 5 percent in December 2007, as the worst
recession since the 1930s took its toll.  Fed policy makers last month began buying Treasury
securities as part of a plan to pump as much as $600 billion
more into the financial system in a bid to keep interest rates
low and spur growth. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has been among
those saying the recovery has been too slow, keeping
unemployment too high and leading to a deceleration in inflation
that raises the risk of deflation, or sustained and damaging
price decreases.  Service Industries  A report from the Institute for Supply Management,
scheduled for 10 a.m. New York time, is projected to show that
the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s non-manufacturing  index  climbed
to 54.8 from 54.3 in October. Readings higher than 50 signal
expansion.  Improving job prospects are benefiting U.S. retailers. J.C.
Penney, the third-largest U.S. department store chain, yesterday
said so-called same-store sales climbed 9.2 percent in November,
above a projection of 3.3 percent. Apparel retailer Gap posted a
5 percent gain. Overall, sales at more than 30 chains tracked by
Retail Metrics Inc. rose 5.3 percent last month from the same
time in 2009, the biggest year-over-year gain since March.  The spending outlook has helped boost retailer shares. The
Standard & Poor’s  Supercomposite Retailing Index , which includes
Amazon.com Inc. and J.C. Penney, has climbed 9.2 percent since
the end of October to reach a three-year high yesterday. The
broader S&P 500  Index  gained 3.2 percent in the same period.  In an effort to reach out to some of the nation’s largest
employers, President  Barack Obama  met with  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
Chief Executive Officer  Mike Duke  at the White House on Nov. 29.
The meeting was one of a series of sessions aimed at soliciting
the views of companies, with the goal of spurring the recovery
and adding jobs.
