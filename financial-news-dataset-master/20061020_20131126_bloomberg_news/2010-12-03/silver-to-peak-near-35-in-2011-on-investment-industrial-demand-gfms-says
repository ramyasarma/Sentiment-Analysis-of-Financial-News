Silver prices may peak near $35 an
ounce next year and average close to $30 on strong investment
demand and continuing growth in industrial consumption, Philip
Klapwijk, chairman of GFMS Ltd., a London-based research
company, said today in Shanghai.  “Looking at next year, I think it’s safe to say that the
economic and financial factors will continue to provide
significant support for global investment in silver,” Klapwijk
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
