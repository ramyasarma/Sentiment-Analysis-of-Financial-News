European  stocks dropped after an
unexpected increase in the U.S. unemployment rate added to
concern that the global economic recovery is stalling, even as
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index snapped three weeks of losses.  “This is worrying,”  Philip Gijsels , head of research at
BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said. “We are in the middle
of a muddle-through stage for the economy. There are still
plenty of risks going into 2011.”  Old Mutual Plc and Barclays Plc led a retreat among
financial shares after the U.S. Labor Department’s report. Deutz
AG slumped 9.7 percent as  shareholders  sold 20 percent of the

p.m. close in London. The gauge completed its biggest two-day
rally since July yesterday as the European Central Bank extended
its emergency loan and bond-buying programs and housing data

recover. The gauge closed within 1 percent of its 2010 high
reached on Nov. 9 as it gained 1.6 percent this week, paring the
previous three weeks of losses.  National benchmark indexes dropped in nine of the 18
western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 0.4
percent, Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.1 percent and France’s
CAC 40 Index gained 0.1 percent.  U.S. Unemployment  U.S. employers added 39,000 jobs in November, fewer than
the most pessimistic prediction of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, after a revised 172,000 increase in October,
Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.  The jobless
rate  rose to 9.8 percent, the highest since April, while hours
worked and earnings stagnated.  Greece had its ‘BB+’ long-term sovereign credit rating
placed on “CreditWatch” with negative implications by Standard
& Poor’s Ratings Services. S&P will assess whether “assigning
‘preferred creditor’ status to future official lending” through
the proposed European Stability Mechanism “could be
detrimental” to bondholders who want to be repaid. The so-
called ESM may govern European Union sovereign bonds from July
2013.  The European Central Bank bought Irish government bonds
today, according to three traders with knowledge of the
transactions. The ECB also purchased Portuguese debt, said two
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deals

comment.  The Bundesbank raised its forecast for German economic
growth this year, predicting the fastest expansion since the
bank released its first data for the reunified country in 1992.

pence after the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by market
value said net income rose to 44.4 million pounds ($69.9
million) in its fiscal first half from 36.9 million pounds a
year earlier. Berkeley benefited from an increase in demand for
homes in the southeast of England, which started in April 2009,
because of its focus on the area. Berkeley sold 1,249 homes in
