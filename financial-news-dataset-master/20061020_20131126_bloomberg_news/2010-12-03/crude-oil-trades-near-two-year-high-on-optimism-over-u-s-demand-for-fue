Oil dropped from a two-year high in
New York after China’s stock-index futures fell amid speculation
the government may tighten monetary policy further in the
world’s biggest energy user.  The January contract declined as much as 42 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $87.58 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $87.59 at 12:38 p.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday, it added $1.25 to $88, the highest settlement
since Oct. 8, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
