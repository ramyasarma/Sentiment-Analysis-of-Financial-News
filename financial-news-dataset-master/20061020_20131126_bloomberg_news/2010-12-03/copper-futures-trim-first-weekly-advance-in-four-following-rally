Copper, trading little changed in
Asia, headed for its first weekly advance in four, as investors
sought to hedge against rising prices even as China may take
further steps to cool inflation.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $8,723.75 a metric ton by 2:14 p.m. in
Singapore, after falling as much as 0.8 percent earlier. The
metal reached $8,751.50 a ton yesterday, the highest price since
Nov. 12.  China will shift to a “prudent” monetary policy next
year, from a relatively loose monetary policy, Xinhua News
Agency reported today. The country will adopt a “proactive”
fiscal policy and strengthen flexibility of macroeconomic
controls next year, Xinhua reported, citing a work meeting of
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee.  “The threat to the rally has always been what China’s
policy is going to be,” Zhuo Guiqiu, an analyst at Minmetals
Futures Co., said from Shenzhen. “Raising interest rates isn’t
going to stop the economy in its tracks. China is still going to
grow.”  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed for a fifth day, by as much as 0.5 percent to
65,700 yuan ($9,863) a ton, erasing a loss of as much as 1
percent earlier. Futures on the Comex in New York were little
changed after dropping as much as 0.8 percent to $3.9490 a
pound.  “Some investors are probably squaring off their positions
after a good run this week,” said Zhuo. “Nothing has changed
fundamentally. Expectations for higher inflation and ongoing
economic recovery will drive prices higher.”  Weekly Gain  Copper in London is still up 5.9 percent this week, the
most since the week ended July 23, after reports showed
manufacturing in China, the U.S. and Europe expanded, adding to
signs of a revival in demand. China’s output grew at a faster
pace for a fourth month in November even as the country raised
interest rates for the first time since 2007 in October.  “Global manufacturing reports this week suggest the
recovery is intact,” said Zhuo. “Falling London and Shanghai
exchange inventories suggest demand is stable.”  Copper  stockpiles  in LME warehouses have shrunk 30 percent
this year, on course for the first annual decline since 2004.
Inventories were 352,425 tons yesterday, the lowest level since
October 2009. Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped last week for the first time in four weeks.  In Chile, wage talks at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata
Plc’s Collahuasi venture are set to extend into a fifth day as
union and company representatives seek to end a strike at the
world’s third-biggest copper mine, a union leader said
yesterday.  The Collahuasi strike entered its 28th day yesterday, the
longest recorded at a major Chilean copper mine, surpassing the
26-day dispute at BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida in 2006.  Zinc in London fell 1.1 percent to $2,236.25 a ton, and tin
fell 0.4 percent to $25,450 a ton. Aluminum rose 0.2 percent to
$2,353.75 a ton, while lead and nickel were little changed at
$2,370.75 a ton and $23,655 a ton respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
