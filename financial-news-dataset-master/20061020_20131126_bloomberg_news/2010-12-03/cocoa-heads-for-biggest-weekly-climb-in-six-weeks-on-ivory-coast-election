Cocoa rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain since mid-July, as a disputed presidential election
in Ivory Coast threatened to disrupt exports from the world’s
largest grower. Sugar, coffee and orange juice also advanced.  Ivory Coast’s Constitutional Court challenged the electoral
commission’s authority to proclaim the results of the Nov. 28
vote after it missed a deadline to announce the outcome,
according to court President  Paul Yao N’Dre . The commission had
named opposition leader Alassane Ouattara as the winner.  “Given that cocoa production is so highly concentrated in
Ivory Coast, any political disruption, violence or unrest” will
see prices rise as investors apply a “risk premium,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London, said today
by telephone. “The market is primed for an uptick.”  Cocoa for March delivery added $67, or 2.3 percent, to
settle at $2,935 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
The most-active contract gained 5 percent this week, the biggest
weekly increase since July 16. Still, prices are down 11 percent
this year.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery gained 36
pounds, or 1.9 percent, to 1,959 pounds ($3,082) a ton on NYSE
Liffe. The contract rose to 1,962 pounds, the highest since Oct.
25  “Cocoa arrivals in ports in the season so far have been
significantly lower year-on-year, despite the fact we’ve had a
very good crop,” Haque said. “This suggests producers are
holding back, either because they are not happy with the price
or they’ve minimized activities because they’re fearful of the
political situation and want to wait to see the outcome.”  The vote was intended to unite Ivory Coast, which has been
divided between a rebel-held north and the government-controlled
south since an uprising in 2002.  Sugar Rises  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 1.05 cents, or
3.7 percent, to 29.5 cents a pound in New York, rising for the
third straight day. In London, refined-sugar futures for March
delivery climbed $12.10, or 1.7 percent, to $740 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  As of Nov. 15, output in India, the world’s second-biggest
producer, slumped 46 percent in the year that began Oct. 1 from
a year earlier to 893,000 tons, according to the food ministry.
A total of 138 mills have been crushing cane since the season
began, compared with 254 mills a year earlier, data from the
ministry showed.  “It seems as if India’s output may be revised downwards,”
 Ricardo Scaff , a trader at Rabobank International in New York.
“The fundamentals are very bullish.”  Brazil is the largest sugar producer.  Robusta-coffee futures for March delivery advanced $16, or
0.9 percent, to $1,864 a ton on NYSE Liffe. In New York,
arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.048 a pound.  Cameroon’s arabica exports dropped to zero in October, the
Cocoa and Coffee Inter-professional Board said. Shipments from
the central African nation were 126 tons a year earlier, it said
today, adding that heavy rains may have delayed the new crop.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 1.35 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $1.568 a pound in New York, gaining 3.6
percent this week, the first weekly gain since late October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
