RWE AG  power station workers in
Germany may stage strikes before Christmas, possibly as early as
the week beginning Dec. 13, the Ver.di labor union said.  No decision has been made on which part of the company
would be hit by walkouts first, the union said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The Ver.di union, the biggest in the country’s energy
industry, demands a 6.5 percent pay increase for 12 months,
according to the statement.  RWE is Germany’s biggest power supplier by capacity of
generating plants while E.ON AG is the country’s biggest utility
by market capitalization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
