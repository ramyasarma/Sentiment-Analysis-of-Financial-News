Kenya’s main  stock index  fell for a
10th day, led by the local unit of Diageo Plc, the world’s
largest liquor maker, and  Bamburi Cement Co. , a subsidiary of
Lafarge SA, the world’s biggest cement maker.  The 55-member  Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index 
dropped 0.3 percent to 78.55 at the 3:05 p.m. close in Nairobi,
bringing its decline in the past 10 days to 7.1 percent. It’s
the longest series of decreases since March 11, 2009.  “There are some fund managers who are selling because of
the new  regulations  on retirement benefits,” which pull pension
money out of the stock market, James Mose, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Financial Services Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  In October, the government allowed people retiring before
age 55 to access half of the pension contribution from their
former employers immediately, provided they worked for three
years, the Daily Nation reported Oct. 30. The move made it
possible for “hundreds of poverty-stricken Kenyans” to access
“millions of shillings in frozen pensions,” the newspaper
reported.  Kenya’s All-Share Index has still advanced 35 percent this
year, outpacing a 14 percent gain in the  MSCI Frontier Markets
Index  during the same period.  Bamburi Cement , the biggest maker of the building material,
retreated 1 percent to 193 shillings.  East African Breweries Ltd. , 43 percent owned by Diageo,
slumped for the third day, losing 0.5 percent lower at 207
shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
