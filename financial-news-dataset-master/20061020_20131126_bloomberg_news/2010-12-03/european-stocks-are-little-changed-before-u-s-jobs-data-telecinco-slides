European stocks were little changed,
with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index poised to snap three weeks of
losses, before a report that may show the labor market in the
world’s largest economy has begun to improve. U.S. futures were
little changed and Asian shares gained.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 was little changed, sliding less
