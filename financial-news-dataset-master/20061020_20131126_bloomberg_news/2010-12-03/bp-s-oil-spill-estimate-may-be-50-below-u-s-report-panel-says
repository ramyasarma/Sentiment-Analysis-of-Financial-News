BP Plc  may estimate that the amount
of oil spilled after the Macondo well blast was as much as 50
percent below reports issued by the U.S., according to the staff
of the commission investigating the Gulf of Mexico disaster.  BP said the federal estimate of almost 5 million barrels is
“premature and inaccurate,” the London-based company said in
an Oct. 21 report to the  National Commission on the BP Deepwater
Horizon Oil Spill  that the panel discussed in Washington today.  “While BP has not released its own flow-rate estimates, it
has suggested that the government’s estimate of the total amount
of oil released from the Macondo well -- 4.9 million barrels --
is overstated by 20 percent to 50 percent,” the commission said
in a Nov. 22 report, citing an Oct. 22 meeting with BP.  At stake is BP’s potential liability for the spill,
triggered by the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers, spewed
crude for 87 days and shut a third of the Gulf to fishing.
Federal law requires that companies spilling oil into U.S.
waters pay a per-barrel fine, with higher penalties if the
accident was caused by gross negligence.  The commission is holding a final public meeting today
before submitting a report on its findings to President  Barack Obama  in early January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
