New Rochelle,  New York , had its
general-obligation debt rating lowered one level to Aa3, the
fourth-highest investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service
after declining tax revenue drained reserves.  The downgrade affects $108 million in debt. The Westchester
County city of about 74,000 people ended fiscal 2009 with a $5.3
million deficit after its reserves fell by almost half to $7.2
million from 2007, Moody’s said in a report today.  “Further declines in the general-fund reserves will put
additional pressure on the rating downwards,” Moody’s analysts
 Vito Galluccio , Robert Weber and  Geordie Thompson  wrote.  New Rochelle, 16 miles (26 kilometers) northeast of New
York City and popular with commuters, will continue to benefit
from its “sizable $11.7 billion tax base with above-average
wealth levels,” the analysts said. The city hopes to raise
money through increasing parking-permit fees and a long-term
land-sale agreement, and has reduced staff through a hiring
freeze and attrition, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
