Blackstone Group LP  Chairman  Stephen Schwarzman  will relocate temporarily to Europe as the world’s
largest private-equity company increasingly pursues deals
outside the U.S., according to a person familiar with his plans.  Schwarzman, 63, will work in Europe initially for about
four to six months, while continuing to spend about the same
amount of time he already does in the New York office, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the plans are
private. Blackstone, based in New York, has offices in Paris,
London, and Dusseldorf, Germany, according to its  website .  Blackstone, created in 1985, has expanded businesses such
as real estate, funds of hedge funds and corporate advisory
while looking further afield for transactions. The firm’s
European holdings include Madame Tussauds operator Merlin
Entertainments Group, Europe’s largest theme park company.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment
on Schwarzman’s plan, which was reported earlier today by
Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
