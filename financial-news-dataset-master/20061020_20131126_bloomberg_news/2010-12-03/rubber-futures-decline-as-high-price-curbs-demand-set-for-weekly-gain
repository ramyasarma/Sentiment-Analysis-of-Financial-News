Rubber declined as end-users slowed
purchases on higher prices, while heavy rains in Thailand
continued to cut supply in the largest exporter, boosting the
cash price to a record. Futures were still set for a weekly gain.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
declined as much as 0.7 percent to 369.1 yen per kilogram
($4,417 a metric ton) before settling at 370.4 yen. The price
reached a 30-year high of 383 yen on Nov. 11.  End-users such as tire makers slow purchases as they draw
down stockpiles, said  Hisaaki Tasaka , an analyst at Tokyo-based
broker ACE Koeki Co. “High prices sapped demand from physical
buyers,” he said by phone today. “They will wait for prices to
retreat.” Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses
fell 2.3 percent to 7,375 tons on Nov. 20, data from the Rubber
Trade Association of Japan showed yesterday.  The  cash rubber price  in Thailand climbed to a record,
rising 1.5 percent to 134.05 baht ($4.46) per kilogram today,
according to the  Rubber Research Institute of Thailand . Demand
remains strong amid a supply shortage as rains persist in
southern Thailand, the institute said. Thailand’s south accounts
for 80 percent of total production.  “Heavy rains in Thailand’s southern provinces raised
worries over tightening supply,”  Chaiwat Muenmee , analyst at DS
Futures Co. said by phone from Bangkok. The monsoon covering
southern Thailand may cause flash floods in the next two days,
the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said today.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai advanced 2.1 percent to
close at 32,365 yuan ($4,858). The price reached a record 38,920
yuan on Nov. 11.  Supply Deficit  Global consumption of natural rubber will outpace supply by
313,000 tons this year, the most since 2006, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. forecast in a November report, revising its September
outlook for an 82,000-ton deficit.  A natural-rubber shortage in India, the world’s biggest
consumer after China, may widen almost five times over the next
decade as rising incomes boost demand for tires, according to an
industry group.  The deficit may widen to 840,000 tons in 2020 from 175,000
tons next year,  Vinod Simon , president of the  All India Rubber
Industries Association , said in an interview. In 2015, the
shortage may be 687,000 tons, Simon said.  The forecast underscores India’s rising demand for
commodities as economic growth stokes consumer demand and the
government boosts infrastructure spending. India’s “commodity
demand has reached a tipping point, and growth is set to
accelerate significantly,” Barclays Capital said last month.  Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s largest tiremaker, expects
to cut rubber use by 50 percent in the next decade to cope with
rising raw material costs, Masayuki Ishii, general manager at
the corporate communications division, said in an interview.  The company will use 1.77 million tons of natural and
synthetic rubber for tire production this year, up 24 percent
from 2009, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
