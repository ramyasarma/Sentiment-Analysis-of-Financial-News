Tomorrow’s Premier League soccer game
between Blackpool and Manchester United has been postponed by a
frozen field at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool said on its website.  Overnight temperatures as low as minus 8 degrees Celsius
(18 degrees Fahrenheit) left parts of the covered field frozen,
Blackpool said. Referee Peter Walton inspected the playing
surface today and determined it would be not thaw in time for
the 5:30 p.m. local time kickoff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
