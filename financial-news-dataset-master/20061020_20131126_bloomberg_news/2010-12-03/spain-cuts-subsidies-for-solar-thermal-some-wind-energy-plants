Spain reduced subsidies paid to solar
thermal power plants and some wind farms to limit the cost of
electricity for homes and businesses.  The government reduced the subsidies earned by wind-power
generators registered under the 2007 Royal Decree 661 by 35
percent until 2013 and eliminated support for solar thermal
plants during their first year of operation at a cabinet meeting
in Madrid today, the Industry Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. Both technologies will face limits on the number of
hours they can earn subsidized rates.  Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  is trying to
rein in power prices to boost industrial competitiveness and
consumer spending. The cost of delivering electricity to Spanish
homes has exceeded the revenue from consumers each year since
2005, with the accumulated deficit forecast to reach 14.6
billion euros ($20 billion) by the end of this year.  The measures will reduce Spanish power costs by 1.1 billion
euros through 2013 and were approved by industry trade groups in
July, according to the government.  The government’s plan to sell bonds backed by that debt
faltered last week as the turmoil in sovereign credit markets
forced bankers working for the state to postpone the first
tranche of the program.  The delay leaves utilities such as  Iberdrola SA  and  Endesa
SA  to carry the debt on their balance sheets. Under Spanish law,
the utilities are obliged to cover the so-called tariff deficit
by lending money to the electricity system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
