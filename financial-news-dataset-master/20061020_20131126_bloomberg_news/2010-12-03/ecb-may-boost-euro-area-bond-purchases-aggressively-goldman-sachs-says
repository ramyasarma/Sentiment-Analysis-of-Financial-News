The European Central Bank may
increase purchases of government bonds to ensure the sovereign
debt crisis abates, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “We remain convinced that the political will among policy
makers, including the ECB, to prevent any systemic event is
unquestionable,” Dirk Schumacher , an economist in Frankfurt,
wrote in a research report dated yesterday. “We could easily
see the ECB stepping up its bond purchases aggressively if
things do not start to normalize.”  Goldman Sachs pushed back its forecast for the first
increase in the ECB’s  main rate  to the fourth quarter of next
year from the third quarter “on the back of renewed tensions
and the ECB’s resolve to tackle these,” analysts including
Schumacher wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
