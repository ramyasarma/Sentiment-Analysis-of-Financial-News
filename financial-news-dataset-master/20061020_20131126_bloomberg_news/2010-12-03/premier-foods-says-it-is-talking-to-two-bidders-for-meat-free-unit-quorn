Premier Foods Plc , the maker of Hovis
breads, said it’s in advanced negotiations to sell its meat-
substitute unit, which it may divest to reduce debt.  Premier Foods has received several bids from food companies
and private-equity firms. Discussions are at “an advanced stage
with two parties,” the St Albans, England-based company said in
a Regulatory News Service statement today.  Nestle has bid for Premier’s Quorn meat-free brand in a
deal that may be worth 230 million pounds ($359 million), Sky
News reported yesterday, without saying where it got the
information. Premier shares rose 12 percent, the biggest gain in
about three months.  Nestle hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. as an adviser and made
the offer through Osem Investments Ltd., an Israel-based unit
that makes kosher food, Sky reported. Osem’s U.S.-based Foodtech
International Inc. unit makes meat-substitute products.  Premier said Oct. 28 it aims to sell assets to reduce  net
debt,  which was 1.37 billion pounds as of June 26. Quorn makes
food from mycoprotein, a low-fat protein derived from a member
of the fungi family. Premier had sales of 131 million pounds
from meat-free products in 2009.  Ferhat Soygenis, a spokesman for Nestle, declined to
comment yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
