Former Chicago Cubs player and
announcer  Ron Santo  died yesterday at age 70, the Chicago
Tribune said, citing friends of his family.  The former third baseman died of complications from bladder
cancer, Chicago’s WGN radio reported. The diabetes patient
continued to work as a baseball analyst for the station even
after both his legs were amputated. He missed several road trips
in 2010.  Santo played between 1960 and 1974, spending all but his
final season with the Cubs, including 1969 when the club’s late-
season collapse allowed the New York Mets to win the National
League pennant. He finished his career with the Chicago White
Sox.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
