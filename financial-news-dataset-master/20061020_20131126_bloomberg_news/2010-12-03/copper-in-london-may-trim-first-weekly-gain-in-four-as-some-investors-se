Copper, trading little changed in
Asia, may pare its first weekly advance in four weeks as some
investors sold the metal to lock in gains following its climb to
a three-week high.  The metal for three-month delivery traded at $8,718 a
metric ton by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time, and may snap a three-day
rally after reaching $8,751.50 a ton yesterday, the highest
price since Nov. 12.  Copper is up 5.7 percent this week, the best performance
since the week ending July 23, after reports showe3d
manufacturing in China, the U.S. and Europe expanded, adding to
signs of a revival in demand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
