Turkey’s  inflation rate  plunged to
the lowest this year, vindicating central bank predictions of a
slowdown and pushing bonds higher.  Inflation slowed to 7.3 percent in November from 8.6
percent the month before, the statistics office in Ankara said
on its website today. It was expected at 8.2 percent, according
to the median estimate of eight economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg. In the  month , prices rose 0.03 percent.  Central bank Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  has kept the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at an historic low of  7 percent  for a
year even as economic growth in the first half exceeded 10
percent. He forecast in October that inflation will slow in the
coming months, making rate increases unnecessary before the last
quarter of 2011.  Today’s inflation figure is a “superb number” that shows
“the central bank got it spot on again,” said  Tim Ash , head of
emerging-market research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
London, in an e-mailed note. “Bonds are going to fly on the
back of this.”  Yields on  benchmark two-year lira bonds  dropped 6 basis
points to 7.65 percent at 10:35 a.m. local time. The lira gained
0.1 percent to 1.4828 per dollar.  Food prices fell 1.9 percent in November, the statistics
agency said. The measure of core inflation, which excludes food
and energy prices, was little changed from the previous month at
2.5 percent.  Close to Targets  The central bank predicts that inflation will end next year
at 5.4 percent and slow to 5.1 percent in 2012, close to its
targets. The bank next meets to set the benchmark one-week  repo
lending rate  on Dec. 16.  Turkey’s gross domestic product grew an annual 10.3 percent
in the second quarter of the year, following an 11.7 percent
jump in the first three months. The government predicts 6.8
percent growth for the full year.  The cost of goods leaving Turkish factories and mines rose
8.2 percent in the 12 months through November, down from 9.9
percent the previous month, the statistics agency said today.
 Producer prices  fell 0.3 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
