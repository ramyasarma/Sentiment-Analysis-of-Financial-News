Poland mustn’t downplay or “get
hysterical” over its growing public debt, which remains low by
European Union standards and would be lower by about one-third
if transfers to private pension funds were excluded, Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski said today in an interview on the
Polish Radio’s Third Channel.  Rostowski said the government can’t afford to relax fiscal
discipline even if it succeeds in getting the European Union to
recalculate Poland’s debt to exclude payments to private pension
funds. The finance minister said he is ‘not an advocate’’ of
suspending payments to the funds entirely.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
