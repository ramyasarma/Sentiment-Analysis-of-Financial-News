The ozone hole over Antarctica, a
doorway for harmful solar radiation in the Southern Hemisphere,
has shrunk to the smallest in five years, according to a New
Zealand government-owned  researcher .  The hole decreased in size to about 22 million square
kilometers (8.5 million square miles) from 24 million square
kilometers last year, Auckland-based  National Institute of Water
and Atmospheric Research  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We can’t definitively say the ozone hole is improving
from one new year of observations,” NIWA atmospheric  scientist 
Stephen Wood said in the statement. “However, we have now had a
few years in succession with less severe holes. That is an
indication we may be beginning to see a recovery.”  The ozone layer, which protects humans from carcinogenic
ultraviolet radiation, was depleted by man-made compounds such
as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Use of CFCs in household items
such as refrigerators and aerosol cans was banned by the
Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987.  The largest ozone hole was recorded in 2000, with an area
of about 29 million square kilometers and a 43 million ton mass
deficit, according to NIWA. The ozone hole forms in August and
September each year and breaks up in November or December, it
said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
