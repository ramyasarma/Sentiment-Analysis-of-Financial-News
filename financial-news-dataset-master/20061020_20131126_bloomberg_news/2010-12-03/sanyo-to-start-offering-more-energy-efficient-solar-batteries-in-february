Sanyo Electric Co.  will start
offering a new solar battery with the world’s highest energy
efficiency next year in an attempt to lure more customers.  The battery maker controlled by Panasonic Corp. will begin
offering the product in Europe in February and later in Japan,
 Tetsuhiro Maeda , head of Sanyo’s  solar panel  operation, told
reporters in Tokyo today. The new battery cell has a conversion
efficiency of 21.6 percent, the highest rate among photovoltaic
batteries available in the market, he said.  The Osaka-based battery maker aims to become one of the top
three global suppliers of solar cells by 2016 and is investing
50 billion yen ($597 million) in its solar operations as part of
a plan to boost  profitability  in the three years to March 2013.
Sanyo aims to win a bigger share of the renewable energy market
by offering panels that can produce more electricity from light
and by releasing new models with lower prices, he said.  Sanyo  rose 0.7 percent to 138 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in Tokyo.  Panasonic, which increased its  stake  in Sanyo in October,
plans to develop next-generation solar panels with the smaller
electronics maker and intends to invest about 100 billion yen in
the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
