Honda Motor Co. , the fourth-largest
automaker in the U.S., said it will discontinue the Element
sport-utility vehicle after the 2011 model as sales fall for the
seventh straight year.  Deliveries of the  Element  peaked at 67,478 in 2003 and have
declined every year since, dropping to 12,960 this year through
November. Consumers have shifted to models like Honda’s CR-V
compact crossover SUV, the Tokyo-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement.  "Compact SUVs have been one of the strongest segments this
decade, but the Element never proved to be a high-volume seller
despite its low price,"  Jessica Caldwell , senior analyst for
automotive data provider Edmunds.com in Santa Monica,
California, said in an e-mailed statement. "It probably suffered
from too much competition -- even from within its own showroom."  U.S. auto sales have risen 11 percent this year amid an 18
percent increase in deliveries of sport-utility and crossover
vehicles, pickups and minivans. Honda’s CR-V, built on the same
line as the Element in East Liberty, Ohio, is the top-selling
model among U.S. SUVs and crossovers this year, up 4.7 percent
to 180,589 units.  Honda’s U.S. unit is based in Torrance, California. The
company trails General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. in U.S. auto sales this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
