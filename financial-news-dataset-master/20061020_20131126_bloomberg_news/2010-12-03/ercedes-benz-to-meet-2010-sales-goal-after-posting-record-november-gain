Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz, the
world’s second-largest luxury vehicle brand, said it will
achieve its 2010 sales goal after posting record sales last
month on demand in Germany and China for E- and S-Class sedans.  Mercedes deliveries in November rose 19 percent to 105,200
cars and sport-utility vehicles, as sales grew by more than 10
percent for the 13th straight month, the Stuttgart, Germany-
based automaker said today in a statement. Including the Smart
mini-car brand, which recorded a 27 percent drop, Daimler’s
sales rose 14 percent to 112,300 in November. Eleven-month
deliveries, including Smart, rose 13 percent to 1.15 million.  “We continue to be confident for the remaining weeks of
the year and will fulfill our forecast to grow by at least 10
percent with Mercedes-Benz passenger cars this year,”  Joachim Schmidt , head of sales, said in the statement.  Luxury car demand is snapping back from the financial
crisis on growth in China and a rebound in the U.S. Mercedes is
also helped by the resurgent economy in Germany, its largest
market. The Bundesbank today raised its growth forecast for
Germany this year to 3.6 percent, which would mark the fastest
growth pace since reunification in 1992.  Mercedes’ sales in Germany last month rose 22 percent to
27,700 vehicles. The brand’s overall sales in western Europe
rose 11 percent to 50,900 cars. Mercedes deliveries in the U.S.
gained 8 percent to 18,200. Sales of E-Class sedans and station
wagons have climbed 48 percent to 229,800 this year, while
demand for the flagship S-Class gained 27 percent to 59,700.  In China, sales gained 68 percent to 14,600 cars last
month, after more than doubling earlier in the year. Sales in
the world’s largest auto market totaled 130,100 vehicles through
November, surpassing  Mercedes  2010 target of 120,000.  Smart sales were burdened by “sharp” declines in its
segment, Daimler said. The brand, which consists solely of a
two-seat city car, sold 7,100 vehicles last month. Deliveries,
which Daimler targets to reach 100,000 in 2010, totaled 89,900
through November.
