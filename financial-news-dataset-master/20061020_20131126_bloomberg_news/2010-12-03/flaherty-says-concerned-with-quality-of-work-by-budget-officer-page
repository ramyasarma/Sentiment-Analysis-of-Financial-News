Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said today he is concerned with the “quality” of
Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page’s work.  Flaherty, who was speaking to reporters in Montreal, said
Page’s report on the effects of the stimulus program was
anecdotal and not factual. He said he’s consulting Canadians on
whether to move up, delay or leave unchanged the plans to
balance the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
