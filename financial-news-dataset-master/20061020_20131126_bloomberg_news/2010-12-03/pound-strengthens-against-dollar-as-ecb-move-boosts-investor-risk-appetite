The pound posted its first weekly
gain against the dollar in a month after a report showed U.S.
employers added fewer jobs than forecast last month.  The U.K. currency declined against the euro. U.S. payrolls
increased 39,000 in November, less than the most pessimistic
projection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S.
jobless rate rose to 9.8 percent, the highest since April, while
hours worked and earnings stagnated, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington.  The reason the pound gained “is obviously the U.S. labor
market report,” said  Hans-Guenter Redeker , head of global
currency strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London. “Sterling’s
pretty much impacted by developments in the U.S. dollar and we
have seen sterling rebounding.”  The pound appreciated 1 percent to $1.5752 at 5.24 p.m. in
London, a weekly gain of 1 percent. It weakened 0.3 percent to
84.94 pence per euro, little changed over the week.  A U.K. index of growth in services businesses published by
Markit Economics Ltd. and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply today stayed close to a four-month high in November.  U.K.  government bonds  fell, pushing the 10-year yield to
3.42 percent. The two-year note yield was little changed at 1.02
percent. Gilts posted a weekly decline with the 10-year yield
rising seven basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
