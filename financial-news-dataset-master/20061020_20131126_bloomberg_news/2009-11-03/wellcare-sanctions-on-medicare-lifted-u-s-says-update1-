             WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG)  can resume
marketing its Medicare insurance plans, the U.S. government
said, lifting sanctions imposed in March.  
 WellCare, based in Tampa,  Florida , can begin enrolling new
beneficiaries for next year in its Medicare Advantage and
Medicare prescription drug plans, said Peter Ashkenaz, a
spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in
an e-mail today.  
 The agency imposed penalties after finding “serious
deficiencies” in WellCare’s handling of member grievances,
broker oversight and privacy breaches, CMS said in a letter to
the company. Medicare generated $974 million in premiums for the
company in this year’s third quarter, accounting for 54 percent
of its total  revenue .  
 “WellCare has satisfactorily addressed the deficiencies
that formed the basis of the sanction, and CMS will release
WellCare,” the agency letter said.  
 The insurer gained 6 cents to $26.32 in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. The  shares  have doubled
this year, the most among the 13 companies in the Standard &
Poor’s  sub-index  of managed-care plans. The sub-index has risen
8.1 percent.
