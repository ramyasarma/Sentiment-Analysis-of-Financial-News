             Russian stocks advanced. OAO Lukoil,
the country's biggest oil producer, and OAO Gazprom, the state-
run natural gas export monopoly, gained with crude oil prices.  
 OAO Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest nickel producer,
increased as the precious metal rose to its highest since at
least 1987.  
 The dollar-denominated RTS Index advanced 0.6 percent to
1722.73 at the close of trading in Moscow, bringing its gain for
the week to 2 percent. The ruble-based Micex Index rose 0.1
percent to 1518.06.  
 Lukoil climbed 0.8 percent to $85.90, while Gazprom,
Russia's biggest company, rose 0.6 percent to $10.97. OAO
Surgutneftegaz, the country's fourth-largest oil producer, added
0.8 percent to $1.33.  
 Brent crude oil for January delivery rose as much as 80
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $60.15 a barrel on London's ICE Futures
Exchange. Prices moved higher after a report that Eni SpA halted
delivery of some Nigerian crude because of a militant attack and
because traders said heating fuel demand will increase in the
U.S.  
 Norilsk Nickel, Russia's biggest mining company, gained 0.4
percent to $145.70. Nickel climbed to its highest in at least 19
years because of concern supply will lag demand after a French
court ordered construction to stop at a $2.15 billion mine
belonging to Cia. Vale do Rio Doce.  
 Nickel for delivery in three months climbed $1,000, or 3.1
percent, to $33,400 a metric ton, the highest since at least
1987, beating the previous 19-year high set yesterday by $650.  
 Russia May Sell  
 Shares of OAO VolgaTelecom, a provider of fixed-line
telecommunications to Russia's Volga region, advanced 1.9 percent
to $4.26, extending yesterday's 3.9 percent gain.  
 Investors are speculating that Russia may sell its 75
percent minus one share stake in OAO Svyazinvest, the national
fixed-line phone company that controls the country's seven
regional phone companies including Volga, Kommersant reported.  
 ``Market activity is low, the only notable exception is
telecoms, likely because of renewed hopes of Svyazinvest's
privatization,'' said Alex Kantarovich, head of research at
Moscow-based MDM Bank.  
 OAO OGK-3, one of six wholesale thermal power companies
that may be sold by Unified Energy, gained 2 percent to 10.2
cents, a record. Investors are speculating it will sell shares to
the public next year after President Vladimir Putin called for
quicker reform of the power sector on Nov. 22.  
 OAO Severstal, Russia's biggest steel company by sales, fell
1.6 percent to $11.51, extending yesterday's 0.4 percent loss.
