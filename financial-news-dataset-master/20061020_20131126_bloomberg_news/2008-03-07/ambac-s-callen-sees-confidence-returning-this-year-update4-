             Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ)  Chief
Executive Officer Michael Callen said he'll restore investor
confidence in the bond insurer by the end of the year.  
 ``We think it takes six months,'' Callen said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today from Ambac's New York headquarters.  
 Ambac, the world's second-largest bond insurer, has lost
about 90 percent of its  market value  in the past 12 months after
record losses on subprime-mortgage securities threatened its AAA
credit rating. The AAA ``is now solid'' after Ambac sold $1.5
billion in stock and convertible shares yesterday, sliced its
 dividend  and halted new guarantees on asset-backed securities,
Callen said. Demand for guarantees on municipal debt will also
return, he said.  
 ``We have a viable business,'' Callen said. ``I think we are
positioned as well as anyone in the industry to go out and
underwrite municipals.''  
 Bond insurers including Ambac and its larger competitor  MBIA
Inc. (MBI)  stumbled after expanding beyond public-finance insurance to
guarantees on collateralized debt obligations that have since
plunged in value. CDOs package pools of securities such as
subprime-mortgage bonds, then split them into pieces with
different ratings.  
 Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's threatened
to downgrade Ambac unless it raised more capital. Ambac yesterday
sold shares at $6.75, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Ambac also sold $250 million of units convertible into shares in
2011, according to a person with knowledge of the sale.  
 `Big Challenge'  
 Ambac today  rose  $2.08, or 28 percent, to $9.50 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading after dropping 15 percent
 yesterday . Ambac's market value had declined to $754 million at
the close of trading yesterday.  
 The offering ``wasn't the easiest thing to sell,'' Callen
said.  
 ``It was a really big challenge,'' Callen said. ``We started
this process 24 hours ago. I was worried about the response, but
we worked hard.''  
 The company sold shares at $6.75, a 9 percent discount to
yesterday's close. Callen, Chief Financial Officer Sean T. Leonard, Chief Risk Officer David Wallis and other executives and
directors purchased shares at that price, according to regulatory
filings today.  
 Existing shareholders, new investors, private-equity firms
and banks all bought stock, Callen said. New York-based private-
equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP invested $50 million
in the equity units, Callen said.  
 Banks bought 40 percent of the shares, with underwriters
taking $405 million of common stock, and  Royal Bank of Scotland 
and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  buying $95 million of shares through a private
placement, according to Paul Burke, an Ambac spokesman.  
 Losing Share  
 In total, Ambac sold 171.1 million shares, and the sale's
managers have an option to sell 25.7 million more, taking total
proceeds to $1.5 billion, Ambac said in a statement today. The
units convert to shares in 2011 and carry a yield of 9.5 percent.  
 Credit Suisse Group (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Bank of America Corp. 
and  UBS AG (UBSN)  managed the transaction.  
 Ambac and Armonk, New York-based MBIA both said they have
written little municipal business this year as borrowers shunned
buying policies from companies that may lose their AAA ratings.
Ambac and MBIA lost market share to  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)  and
Dexia SA's Financial Security Assurance Inc., which avoided large
writedowns because they didn't expand as rapidly into subprime-
mortgage guarantees.  
 Casting Doubt  
 Assured and Financial Security were the only AAA insurers to
guarantee municipal bonds in the first two weeks of February,
according to a Merrill Lynch & Co. report that cites preliminary
data compiled by Thomson Financial. Assured Guaranty's new
business production more than quadrupled in the fourth quarter,
the company said this month. In December, the company raised $318
million in a  share sale  to take advantage of demand.  
 The loss of Ambac's top rating would have cast doubt on the
more than half a trillion of municipal and asset-backed
securities insured by the company, forcing some investors to sell
the debt and others to reduce their holdings. Bond insurers with
AAA ratings have guaranteed $2.4 trillion of debt.  
 Ambac insured $376.6 billion of public finance securities
and $176.6 billion of asset-backed debt.  
 Ambac abandoned a plan to sell shares in mid-January. The
company announced a $1 billion sale Jan. 16, sparking a 70
percent plunge in its stock and canceled the offering Jan. 18.  
 Some analysts said earlier that the revived offering
wouldn't be enough to stabilize Ambac's ratings.  
 ``Based on our estimate that Ambac will eventually absorb
about $11 billion of losses from insured CDOs and mortgage-backed
securities related exposures, $1.5 billion of new capital at
first blush does not seem like enough to fix the capital adequacy
problem,'' Andrew Wessel, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities in
New York, said in a March 6 research report.
