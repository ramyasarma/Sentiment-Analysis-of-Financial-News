             Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , the
world's second-largest bond insurer, raised about $1.5 billion in
a sale of shares and convertible units, more than doubling its
stock outstanding to salvage its AAA credit rating.  
 Ambac  rose  $2.08, or 28 percent, to $9.50 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The company sold shares at $6.75, a
9 percent discount to yesterday's close. Chief Executive Officer
Michael Callen, Chief Financial Officer Sean T. Leonard and other
executives and directors purchased shares at that price,
according to regulatory filings today. New York-based Ambac also
issued $250 million of units convertible into shares.  
 While the sale will dilute the ownership of  shareholders ,
the offering probably will be enough to convince New York-based
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's to affirm Ambac's
rating. The companies threatened to downgrade Ambac after the
company posted record losses on subprime-mortgage securities,
putting at risk the credit ratings of $556 billion of municipal
and asset-backed securities.  
 ``They might be able to maintain the ratings at Moody's and
S&P for the time being, but it's a Band-Aid,'' Robert Haines, an
analyst at CreditSights Inc., an independent bond research firm
in New York, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
Haines said the market was looking for Ambac to raise as much as
$3 billion.  
 Cerberus Investment  
 Existing shareholders, new investors, private-equity firms
and banks all bought stock, Callen said in an interview today.
New York-based private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP
invested $50 million in the equity units, Callen said.  
 Banks bought 40 percent of the shares, with underwriters
taking $405 million of common stock, and  Royal Bank of Scotland 
and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  buying $95 million of shares through a private
placement, according to Paul Burke, an Ambac spokesman.  
 In total, Ambac sold 171.1 million shares and the sale's
managers have an option to sell 25.7 million more, taking total
proceeds to $1.5 billion, Ambac said in a statement today. The
units convert to shares in 2011 and carry a yield of 9.5 percent.  
 Credit Suisse Group (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Bank of America Corp. 
and  UBS AG (UBSN)  managed the sale.  
 ``The AAA is now solid,'' Callen said on Bloomberg
Television.  
 The sale mainly attracted existing shareholders, though some
new investors also bought stock, Callen said. After a 92 percent
slump in the past year, the offering ``wasn't the easiest thing
to sell,'' Callen said. Ambac's market value had declined to $754
million at the close of trading yesterday.  
 `Big Challenge'  
 ``It was a really big challenge,'' Callen said. ``We started
this process 24 hours ago. I was worried about the response, but
we worked hard.''  
 Ambac said earlier this week that it planned to sell $1
billion of common shares and $500 million of convertible units.
All but $100 million of the proceeds will go to the company's
Ambac Assurance unit, Ambac said. That $100 million will be used
to pay off some of the holding's company's debt. Ambac has long-
term borrowings of $1.7 billion, according to company filings.  
 Most of the bond insurance industry, including Ambac and its
larger competitor  MBIA Inc. (MBI) , stumbled after expanding beyond
municipal insurance to guarantees on collateralized debt
obligations or CDOs that have since plunged in value. CDOs
package pools of securities then split them into pieces with
different ratings.  
 Cutting Dividend  
 In addition to selling shares, Ambac plans to bolster
capital by cutting its  dividend  to 1 cent from 21 cents a share
and suspend its business of writing guarantees on many kinds of
bonds, including those backed by mortgages.  
 The loss of Ambac's top rating would cast doubt on the more
than half a trillion of municipal and asset-backed securities
insured by the company, forcing some investors to sell the debt
and others to reduce their holdings. Bond insurers with AAA
ratings have guaranteed $2.4 trillion of debt.  
 Ambac abandoned a plan to sell shares in mid-January. The
company announced a $1 billion sale Jan. 16, sparking a 70
percent plunge in its stock and canceled the offering Jan. 18.  
 Some analysts said earlier in yesterday that the revived
offering wouldn't be enough to stabilize Ambac's ratings.  
 ``Based on our estimate that Ambac will eventually absorb
about $11 billion of losses from insured CDOs and mortgage-backed
securities related exposures, $1.5 billion of new capital at
first blush does not seem like enough to fix the capital adequacy
problem,'' Andrew Wessel, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities in
New York, said in a March 6 research report.
