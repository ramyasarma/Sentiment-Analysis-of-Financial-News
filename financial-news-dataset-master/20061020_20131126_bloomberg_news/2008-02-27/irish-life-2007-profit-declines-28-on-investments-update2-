             Irish Life & Permanent Plc (IPM) ,
Ireland's largest life insurer, said 2007 profit fell 28 percent
as stock-market declines eroded gains from investments. It
raised its profit forecast for this year.  
 Net income was 404 million euros ($607 million), the
Dublin-based company said today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. That compares with 561 million euros a year earlier
under so-called European Embedded Value accounting rules, which
incorporate changes in the value of investments. The result
missed the 448 million-euro median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Irish Life said on Dec. 13 it may face a ``single-digit''
loss this year in operating profit, which excludes investment
fluctuations, after the collapse of the U.S. sub prime mortgage
market sparked higher borrowing costs. Today, Irish Life said
profit may rise ``marginally'' in 2008, as European money
markets ease.  
 ``The good news is we've seen a considerable easing in
short-term money markets since year end,'' Irish Life Chief
Executive Officer Denis Casey said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. ``We're improving our guidance.''  
 Irish Life gained 25 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 11.50 euros
as of 8:02 a.m. in Dublin, after rising 8.7 percent yesterday.
The shares have dropped 36 percent over the past six months.  
 Operating profit in 2007 rose 12 percent to 590 million
euros. The three-month  euro  interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
has dropped 29 basis points to 4.39 percent this year. That's
still 39 basis points more than the European Central Bank's key
financing rate of 4 percent, compared with an average gap of 25
basis points in the first half of 2007.  
 Pretax profit under embedded value rules fell to 460
million euros last year from 592 million euros in 2006. Irish
Life said it booked a loss on its investment portfolio of around
114 million euros in 2007, compared with a gain of 101 million
euros the previous year.
