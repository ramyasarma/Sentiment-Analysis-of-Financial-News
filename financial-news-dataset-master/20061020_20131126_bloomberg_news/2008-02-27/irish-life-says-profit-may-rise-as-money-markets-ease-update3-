             Irish Life & Permanent Plc (IPM) , Ireland's
largest life insurer, said operating profit may be at the high end
of its forecast range this year as European money markets ease.  
 Profit may rise ``marginally'' in 2008, Dublin-based Irish
Life said in a statement today. In December, the company said it
may face a ``single-digit'' decline in profit after the collapse of
the U.S. subprime mortgage market sparked higher borrowing costs.  
 ``The guidance is reassuring,'' said Kevin McConnell, the head
of research at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin, who has a ``buy''
rating on the stock. ``There's obviously more clarity on the
funding side.''  
 Money-market rates have tumbled since policy makers announced
Dec. 12 a coordinated effort to break the gridlock in interbank
lending sparked by the subprime-mortgage crisis. The  three-month
euro interbank  offered rate, or Euribor, has dropped 30 basis
points to 4.39 percent this year.  
 Longer-term debt markets remain ``difficult,'' Irish Life
said. The company gets about two-thirds of its funding from
wholesale markets, while other Irish banks use the markets for less
than half of their financing, according to Sebastian Orsi, an
analyst at Merrion Capital in Dublin.  
 The profit guidance takes account of a 29 million-euro ($43.6
million) gain from the sale of a 2.5 billion-euro bond portfolio.  
 Shares Drop  
 Irish Life fell 3 percent to 10.91 euros in Dublin, having
gained 8.7 percent yesterday. The shares have dropped 40 percent
over the past six months, partly on concern that the slowing Irish
economy and rising funding costs may hurt earnings growth.  
 ``With Irish Life, there's a concern about funding and about
the demise of the Celtic Tiger,'' said Kevin Ryan, a London-based
analyst at ING Financial Markets with a ``buy'' rating on the
stock. ``I don't think those concerns are justified.''  
 Irish Life's operating profit in 2007 rose 12 percent to 590
million euros, the company said. Net income was 404 million euros,
compared with 561 million euros a year earlier under so-called
European Embedded Value accounting rules, which incorporate changes
in the value of investments.  
 Irish Life booked a loss on its investment portfolio of about
114 million euros in 2007, compared with a gain of 101 million
euros the previous year.  
 The company raised its final dividend by 10 percent to 52.5
cents a share. Irish Life Chief Executive Officer Denis Casey said
it's ``not unreasonable'' to expect dividend growth to moderate
this year.  
 ``The good news is we've seen a considerable easing in short-
term money markets since year-end,'' Casey said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. ``We're improving our guidance.''
