             OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) , the world's
largest nickel and palladium producer, faces a fine of 4.35
billion rubles ($180 million) for polluting rivers at its main
Russian site, the Natural Resources Ministry said.  
 The ministry's environmental safety watchdog is seeking a
local arbitration court ruling on the matter, the ministry said
in an e-mailed statement today. The company caused 4.37 billion
rubles of environmental damage between August and November, the
ministry said.  
 Norilsk hasn't received the inspectorate's statement of
claim, spokeswoman Elena Kovaleva said in an e-mailed statement
today. The company won't comment further until then, she said.  
 The company breached by as much as 2,400 times the permitted
levels of discharge for metals and chemicals such as iron,
nickel, phosphate and chloride, and failed to meet deadlines to
cut pollution, the ministry said Sept. 13 after more than a month
of tests.  
 Norilsk is spending $1.25 billion on modernizing production
to cut emissions including sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, nitrogen
and carbon dioxide between 2004 and 2015.  
 The ministry is also seeking a court decision on a 141
million-ruble fine for Evraz Group SA's Siberian power unit.
