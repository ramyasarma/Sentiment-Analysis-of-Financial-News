             Spain 's Pasa Group plans to buy
Italy's Star SpA to combine the bouillon cube makers into a
business owned equally by the companies' controlling families.  
 Star's owner, the Fossati family's Findim Investments, will
invest in Pasa after the transaction to reach an equal
partnership with the Spanish company's owners, the Carulla
family, according to a joint statement issued today. Financial
details weren't disclosed.  
 ``The acquisition of Star will reinforce our position in
the culinary aids on a pan-European level,'' Artur Carulla,
president of Pasa Group, said in the statement.  
 Pasa is the holding company that controls soup and
bouillon-cube maker Gallina Blanca. Star is the biggest maker of
bouillon cubes in  Italy , where its other products include ready-
to-use sauces and tomato products. The company also sells its
products in the Netherlands.  
 The Fossati family ended efforts to sell Star last year after
offers were below its expectations. Il Sole/24 Ore said at the
time the bids were worth about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion).  
 Spanish financial Web site Bolsacino.com said today's
transaction was worth 900 million euros, without saying how it
got the information. Isabel Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the
Carulla family's holding company Agrolimen said she couldn't
comment on or disclose the value of the agreement.
