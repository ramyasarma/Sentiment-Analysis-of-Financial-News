             China Vanke Co. (000002) , the country's
largest listed developer, said it received approval to raise as
much as 4.2 billion  yuan  ($536 million) selling new shares to
finance the construction of apartments in Beijing and Shanghai.  
 Vanke's local-currency shares rose 1.3 percent to a record
12.95 yuan at the 3 p.m. close in Shenzhen. The company's shares
have tripled this year.  
 The company received  China Securities Regulatory Commission 
approval to sell 700 million yuan-denominated shares, Vanke said
in a statement to Shenzhen's stock exchange today.  
 Vanke plans to sell the shares to biggest shareholder China
Resources Holdings Ltd. and nine institutional investors, Vanke
said on July 18. It will use the proceeds to build apartments in
Beijing,  Shanghai , Wuhan and other cities, the company, based in
the southern city of Shenzhen, said.  
 Vanke is taking advantage of demand for Chinese stocks to
raise money. The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index, a benchmark for
shares on China's two exchanges, surged 95 percent this year, the
world's fifth-biggest gainer.
