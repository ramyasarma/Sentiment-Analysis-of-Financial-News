             China’s stocks rose for a third day,
led by airlines, automakers and alternative-fuel shares, on the
prospect the government will spur growth in the economy by
investing more in new energy and domestic consumption.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 2,544.47
at 10:56 a.m. local time, rising above its 50-day moving average
for the first time in three months.
