             Morgan Stanley , buoyed by rising
revenue, set aside 37 percent more money to pay employees in the
first half of 2010 even as rivals  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  investment bank lowered their
compensation expenses.  
 Morgan Stanley allocated $7.94 billion to pay employees in
the first six months of 2010, up from $5.78 billion a year
earlier, company  data  show. Goldman Sachs’s first-half
compensation dropped to $9.3 billion from $11.4 billion and
JPMorgan’s investment bank set aside $5.3 billion versus $6
billion. All of the figures exclude U.K. bonus tax costs.  
 The jump at Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, is connected to an improvement in revenue during the
period that was helped by better trading results than analysts
expected, said  Jeanne Branthover , managing director at
recruitment firm Boyden Global Executive Search. Morgan
Stanley’s equity trading revenue in the second quarter
outstripped all of its biggest rivals.  
 “They must have extremely good people in those jobs and
they’re performing,” Branthover said of Morgan Stanley.
“They’re coming out winners.”  
 The three Wall Street firms added 5,125 employees in the
last year, with more than half -- 2,900 -- joining Goldman
Sachs. That contributed to a drop in average pay per employee at
Goldman Sachs to $272,581 in the first half from $364,135 a year
earlier, while Morgan Stanley’s average climbed to $126,244 from
$94,465 a year earlier.  
 Even with the increase, Morgan Stanley is putting aside a
smaller percentage of revenue for compensation expenses compared
with 2009, as first-half revenue more than doubled. The firm set
aside 47 percent of revenue for pay costs, excluding the U.K.
bonus tax, compared with 71 percent a year earlier.  
 Goldman Sachs’s compensation costs accounted for 43 percent
of revenue, compared with 49 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan’s
investment bank set aside 36 percent in the first half, from 38
percent in the first six months of 2009.
