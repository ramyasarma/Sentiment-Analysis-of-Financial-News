             The International Monetary Fund
agreed to disburse $135.6 million to Latvia following a review
of economic policies in the Baltic state under a $2.29 billion
loan.  
 Policies put in place “have helped stabilize the economy,
restore confidence, and limit spillovers from financial market
turbulence elsewhere in Europe,” the Washington-based IMF said
in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The Baltic nation’s  economy  is rebounding from last year’s
18 percent slump as manufacturing and  exports  advance. Output
expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in the first three
months, the first quarterly growth in two years.  
 “Considerable fiscal adjustment is still needed to
preserve debt sustainability and lower the deficit,” IMF Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair  Naoyuki Shinohara  said in the
statement.  
 Latvia approved budget cuts equal to about 10 percent of
its economy to comply with the terms of a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.6
billion) loan from a group led by the IMF and the European
Commission. It plans to lower its deficit to 3 percent of its
gross domestic product in 2012 so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  
 To support growth and meet criteria to join the euro,
Latvia will need to also reduce unemployment, improve
competitiveness and restore the health of the financial
industry, Shinohara said.
