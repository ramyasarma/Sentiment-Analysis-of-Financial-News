             Philippine four-year bonds rose,
snapping a three-day drop, after a government pledge to meet
this year’s budget-deficit target damped concern debt sales will
be stepped up. The peso weakened.  
 President Benigno Aquino’s three-week-old administration is
sticking to its 325 billion peso ($7 billion) budget-deficit
ceiling this year even and will push revenue agencies to bolster
collection, Treasurer Roberto Tan said today. The six-month
deficit widened to 196.7 billion pesos, exceeding a forecast of
178.5 billion pesos made by the last government, a report showed.  
 “It’s signaling that they’re responsible and committed to
containing the deficit number to the target they have
publicized,” said  Antonio Espedido Jr ., treasurer at China
Banking Corp. in Manila.  
 The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due in September 2014
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.95
percent in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.
The rate reached a two-week high of 6 percent yesterday.  
 The Philippines must start turning away from a loose
monetary policy setting amid faster economic growth, the
International Monetary Fund said yesterday. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low
4 percent last week and Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday
there’s “no urgency” to raise borrowing costs as the inflation
outlook remains “favorable.”  
 The  peso  slid 0.1 percent to 46.475 per dollar, according
to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc.
