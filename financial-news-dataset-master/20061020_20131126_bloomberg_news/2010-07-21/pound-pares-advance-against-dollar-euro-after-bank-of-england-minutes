             The pound pared its advance against
the dollar and the euro after the minutes of the Bank of
England’s last meeting showed policy makers voted unanimously to
keep the bank’s asset-purchase program unchanged at 200 billion
pounds ($306 billion).  
 Britain’s currency was 0.1 percent higher to $1.5281 as of
9:42 a.m. in London, after earlier climbing as much as 0.5
percent. The currency traded at 0.3 percent stronger against the
euro, at 84.16 pence, after appreciating 0.5 percent.  
 The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Mervyn King,
also voted 7-1 to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.5
percent, according to minutes of the July 8 decision released in
London today. Andrew Sentance voted for an increase, the minutes
showed.
