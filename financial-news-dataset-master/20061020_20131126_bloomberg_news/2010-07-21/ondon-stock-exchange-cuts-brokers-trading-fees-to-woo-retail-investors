             London Stock Exchange Group Plc ,
which is fighting competition from new rivals, will cut fees for
private client brokers and offer free trading for six months as
Chief Executive Officer  Xavier Rolet  seeks to woo retail
investors.  
 Starting Aug. 2, private client brokers who sign up for the
pricing promotion will get six months free trading when they
send orders to LSE, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement
today. At the end of the period, the tariff will rise to 0.1
basis point, which compares with the “typical” fee of 0.45
basis point at present.  
 Since starting in May last year, Rolet  has been trying to
diversify LSE’s business and stem its loss of market share to
multilateral trading facilities such as Bats Europe and  Chi-X
Europe Ltd. , which have taken business mostly from institutional
investors. Now he’s also contending with competition from
Equiduct Systems Ltd., an MTF majority owned by Citadel
Investment Group LLC, which is focused on retail brokers.  The
Order Machine , an alternative trading system owned by brokers
 BinckBank NV , Optiver and ABN Amro Holding NV, is also focused
on retail banks.  
 “We are keen to grow the order flow from retail brokers,”
said  Nicolas Bertrand , LSE’s head of equity and derivative
markets, in the statement today. “This new pricing scheme will
make it cost effective for private client brokers to offer their
customers the option to trade directly on the exchange’s order
book.”  
 LSE on July 14 reported fiscal first-quarter sales rose 0.8
percent to 158.2 million pounds ($241.3 million) as Europe’s
largest bourse by value of listed companies made more money from
technology. LSE also said its share of trading of U.K. stocks
rose in the first quarter, with an average 62.4 percent of total
cash equities trading compared with 60 percent in April. It’s
Turquoise MTF had a 5.4 percent market share in June compared
with 4.3 percent in April.
