             Starbucks Corp., which declared its
first dividend in March, raised its quarterly payout to 13
cents a share from 10 cents, according to Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.
data obtained by Bloomberg.  
 Deb Trevino , a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based company,
declined to comment. Starbucks is scheduled to release fiscal
third-quarter results after the 4 p.m. close of U.S. stock
exchanges. The company may post profit excluding items of 29
cents a share, according to the average of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The coffee chain has boosted profit three straight
quarters. The company, led by Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz , has introduced items such as instant coffee and offered
free Wi-Fi Internet service to attract U.S. consumers, some of
whom had shied away from spending during the economic slump.  
 Starbucks shares fell 2.3 percent to $25.17 at 3:41 p.m.
New York time, trimming their 2010 advance to 9.2 percent. That
compares with the 4.3 percent loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index since Dec. 31.
