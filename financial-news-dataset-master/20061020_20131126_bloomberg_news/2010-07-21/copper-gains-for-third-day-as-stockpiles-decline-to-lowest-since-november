             Copper climbed for a third day in
Asia as inventories extended their declines, fueling
expectations that demand remains robust.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.8 percent to $6,695.50 a metric ton,
and traded at $6,670 at 3:22 p.m. in Singapore. October copper
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose as much as 1 percent to
53,600 yuan ($7,908) a ton, before ending at 53,350 yuan.  
 Copper  stockpiles  in LME warehouses fell yesterday for the
23rd day, the longest slump in more than a year. Stockpiles
tallied by the LME stood at 419,600 tons, the lowest level since
Nov. 18, down 16 percent this year.  
 “The continued decline in inventories provides a
supportive background,” Zhao Kai, an analyst at Jinrui Futures
Co., said from Shenzhen. “Everyone’s expecting the global
economy to slow in the second half of this year, however, slow
growth doesn’t mean no growth.”  
 The metal used in electrical wiring and pipes rose as much
as 2.5 percent yesterday, the most in two weeks, after U.S.
building permits increased for the first time since March. The
U.S. is the second-largest copper consumer after China, and
builders are the biggest users of the metal.  
 “The increasing correlation between prices and inventory
developments indicates that fundamentals specific to base metals
are coming back into focus,”  Stefan Graber , an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Singapore, wrote in a note today.
“The longer-term outlook remains positive.”  
 Copper Shipments  
 China ’s refined-copper  imports  fell for a third month in
June to 211,957 tons as lower domestic prices discouraged
purchases and local output surged, the customs office said today.
That’s 24 percent less than in May and 44 percent less than a
year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 Futures in China, which include a 17 percent value-added
tax and import fees, traded at a discount to London contracts in
June, after losing 4.3 percent compared with 3.5 percent in
Shanghai. Domestic output of the refined metal rose to a record
last month, offsetting the drop in imports amid steady demand.  
 “The market was expecting the decline in the refined
numbers because of the negative arbitrage last month,” said Li
Ye, an analyst at Minmetals Starfutures Co. “Domestic users are
also trying to work off the metal already in the country rather
than import more, judging from the recent fall in stockpiles.”  
 Inventories  monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
dropped for a second month, by 21 percent in June, the biggest
monthly decline since April 2009.  
 Aluminum in London rose 0.4 percent to $1,978 a ton, while
nickel climbed 0.2 percent to $19,155 a ton. Zinc fell 0.6
percent to $1,863 a ton, lead dropped 0.7 percent to $1,826 a
ton, and tin was unchanged at $18,240 a ton at 3:09 p.m. in
Singapore.
