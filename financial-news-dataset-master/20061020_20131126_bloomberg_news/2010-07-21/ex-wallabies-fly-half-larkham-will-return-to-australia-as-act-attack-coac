             Stephen Larkham , the Wallabies’ most
experienced fly-half, will return to Australian rugby to become
the attack coach of the ACT Brumbies Super 15 team.  
 Larkham, a Rugby World Cup winner in 1999, was hired on a
two-year contract and will take up his post after completing his
third season with the Ricoh Black Rams in Japan, the Canberra-
based Brumbies said today in a statement.  
 “Steve’s credentials as a player are second to none and he
is renowned as being one of the playing masterminds of the
modern game,” said Brumbies head coach Andy Friend. “He’s
always had an attacking mentality as a player.”   
 Larkham, 36, played 102 Tests for Australia and also helped
the Brumbies win the 2001 and 2004 Super Rugby titles during a
116-game playing career with the team.
