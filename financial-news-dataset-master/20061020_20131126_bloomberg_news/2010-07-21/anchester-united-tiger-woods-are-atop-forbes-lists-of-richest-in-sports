             Manchester United is the richest
team in sports, while  Tiger Woods  is the highest-earning
athlete, according to  Forbes magazine .  
 English Premier League soccer team United is worth $1.84
billion and Woods, the top-ranked player in the  Official World
Golf Ranking , earned $105 million in the year through June,
Forbes said.  
 Four U.S. teams follow United in the ranking. The five-time
Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are No. 2 with a value of
$1.65 billion, $50 million more than the New York Yankees, who
last year won a record-extending 27th World Series title. The
National Football League’s Washington Redskins ($1.55 billion)
and New England Patriots ($1.36 billion) round out the top five.  
 Woods is the only athlete to have surpassed $1 billion in
career earnings, Forbes said in October. The 14-time winner at
golf’s four major championships has seen his endorsement income
slump by $22 million to $70 million since he admitted in
December to marital infidelity, Sports Illustrated said
yesterday. Woods earned $90.5 million in 2009, SI.com said.  
 Woods was ditched as a pitchman by  Accenture Plc ,  AT&T
Inc. ,  Procter & Gamble Co. ’s Gillette razors and  PepsiCo Inc. ’s
Gatorade after details about his private life emerged following
a November car crash outside his Florida home. He hasn’t won a
tournament since.  
 Mayweather and Pacquiao  
 Boxer  Floyd Mayweather  ranks second on the Forbes list
behind Woods, with $65 million in annual earnings. Mayweather,
who aptly uses the nickname “Money,” has held six world titles
in five weights, according to a biography on  HBO.com , and is
undefeated in 41 fights.  
 Mayweather is the World Boxing Council welterweight
champion. A deadline for the 33-year-old American to agree to
fight World Boxing Organization welterweight champion  Manny Pacquiao  of the Philippines in November expired July 17 without
Mayweather accepting the terms,  ESPN reported  three days ago.  
 Ring magazine ranks Mayweather and Pacquiao, who is eighth
on the Forbes list with annual income of $42 million, as the two
best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.  
 Kobe Bryant  of the Los Angeles Lakers is the third-highest
paid athlete, with an income of $48 million.  
 Bryant was last month voted the Most Valuable Player of the
National Basketball Association Finals for the second straight
year as he helped the Lakers to win a 16th title.  
 In this year’s playoffs, the 31-year-old Bryant averaged
29.2 points and six rebounds, compared with career averages of
25.3 points and 5.3 rebounds.  
 Mickelson, Beckham  
 Masters Tournament champion  Phil Mickelson , ranked second
in the world behind Woods, is next on the list with $46 million
in annual income and the top five is completed by Los Angeles
Galaxy soccer player  David Beckham , the England international
who made $43.7 million in the year through June.  
 United is one of nine soccer clubs included among the top
50 sports properties by value, which is defined by Forbes as a
team’s equity plus its net debt.  
 Record nine-time European champion Real Madrid is the
second-most valuable team in the sport at $1.32 billion,
followed by United’s rival Arsenal, which Forbes said is worth
$1.18 billion. The soccer teams’ values are the same as those
attributed to them by the magazine on April 21.  
 NFL Sweep  
 All 32 NFL teams are included. While their order remains as
it did in a  Forbes study released Sept. 2 , some team values have
changed, with the Cowboys dropping $50 million in value from
$1.7 billion and the Redskins increasing by the same amount, for
example.  
 Four Major League Baseball clubs other than the Yankees
make the grade. Those are the Boston Red Sox (35th, $870
million), the New York Mets (38th, $858 million), the Los
Angeles Dodgers (45th, $727 million) and the Chicago Cubs (46th,
$726 million). The MLB teams’ values are the same as they were
in a Forbes report released April 7.  
 The only two NBA teams on the ranking occupy the last two
spots, with the Lakers valued at $607 million and the New York
Knicks worth $586 million. No National Hockey League teams
appear in the list.  
 The only other sport represented is Formula One motor
racing, with Ferrari, the oldest team, ranked 16th at $1.05
billion and McLaren Mercedes in the 42nd spot with a value of
$805 million.
