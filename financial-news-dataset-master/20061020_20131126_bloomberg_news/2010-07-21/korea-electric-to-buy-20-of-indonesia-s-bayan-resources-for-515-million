             Korea Electric Power Corp. , South
Korea’s largest utility, will buy a 20 percent stake in  PT Bayan
Resources  for about $515 million to add supplies of coal used to
generate half the electricity in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.  
 The Seoul-based utility will purchase 667 million shares of
the Indonesian coal producer for 7,000 rupiah each, Korea
Electric said in a regulatory filing today. That’s a 2.8 percent
discount to Bayan’s close yesterday. The stock rose 0.7 percent
to 7,250 rupiah in Jakarta.  
 South Korea’s biggest coal acquisition this year follows
the utility’s July 5 decision to buy a mine in Australia from
Anglo American Plc for A$403 million ($357 million). The country
imports almost all its energy needs and the government has said
state-run companies may work with the nation’s $30 billion
sovereign wealth fund to buy overseas energy assets.  
 “Korea Electric will continue to step up overseas
acquisitions before global economic recovery boosts global
energy and mineral prices,” said  Shin Ji Yoon , an analyst at
KTB Securities Co. in Seoul. “These assets will help shield
them from future price volatility and, in the long-term, make
the company’s earnings more stable.”  
 Coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, an Asian benchmark, has
climbed 12 percent to $96.20 a metric ton this year, according
to data compiled by the McCloskey Group.  Prices  reached a record
$192.50 a ton in July 2008.  
 Coal Reserves  
 Korea Electric posted its second annual loss last year in
its 26-year history because of higher fuel import costs. The
company reported a deficit of 77.7 billion won in 2009 after a
2.95 trillion-won loss in 2008.  
 Bayan has about 1 billion tons of coal reserves in eight
mines, and Korea Electric will share management control of the
company, the utility said today.  
 Korea Electric  said the stake will give the utility 2
million tons of coal a year from 2012 and 7 million tons from
2015. After the purchase the company will source 34 percent of
its coal needs from its own assets compared with 24 percent now,
according to the statement.  
 Korea Electric’s investments in Australia and Indonesia
currently help supply 24 million tons of coal each year,
according to the company.  
 Shares of Korea Electric dropped 0.6 percent to close at
31,900 won, compared with the 0.7 percent gain in the benchmark
Kospi index. The deal was announced after market close.
