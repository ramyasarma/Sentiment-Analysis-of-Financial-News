             Iberdrola SA , Spain’s largest
utility, said first-half profit declined 2.6 percent after it
earned less from asset sales.  
 Net income  fell to 1.47 billion euros ($1.89 billion) from
1.51 billion euros a year earlier, the Bilbao-based company said
today on its website. That almost matches the 1.448 billion-euro
 mean estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Asset-sale
gains dropped to 83.6 million euros from 223 million euros.  
 Iberdrola, the world’s largest owner of wind-energy parks,
generates more than half its power  outside Spain  after expanding
abroad to cut reliance on the Spanish market, where demand fell
last year and regulators let it recoup only a portion of costs.
The company plans to sell more assets after  buying  U.S. utility
Energy East Corp. in 2008 and  Scottish Power Ltd.  in 2007.  
 “Iberdrola is able to keep a sustainable growth pace by
supporting itself in one area or another, depending on the
circumstances,” Chief Executive  Jose Ignacio Sanchez Galan  said
on a conference call today.  
 The utility’s hydropower output more than doubled in the
first half, while electricity use in Spain rose 4.2 percent
after the recession had eroded demand last year. The average
spot price in Spain in the first half fell to 31.14 euros a
megawatt-hour from 40.81 euros a year earlier.  
 Iberdrola  shares slipped 0.1 percent to 5.15 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading in Madrid. The shares have dropped 23
percent this year, valuing the company at 27 billion euros.  
 Ebitda Growth  
 The utility has targeted average  annual growth  of 5 percent
to 9 percent in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization from 2009 through 2012. First-half Ebitda rose 12
percent to 3.836 billion euros.  
 Iberdrola said Feb. 24 that net investment from 2010
through 2012 may total 16 billion euros as it spends more on
renewable-energy projects and networks. Gross investment may
climb to 18 billion euros, while asset sales may raise as much
as 2.5 billion euros through 2012. Almost two-thirds of the
planned gross investment was earmarked for the U.S. and the U.K.  
 The company ended 2009 with  net debt  of 29.2 billion euros
and that increased to 30.7 billion euros at the end of June.
This year, Iberdrola sold a 2.7 percent stake in Portuguese
utility  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , following the sale of its
15.7 percent holding in Petroceltic International Plc in
January.  
 Investment Strategy  
 UIL Holdings Corp., a Connecticut power supplier, on May 25
said it agreed to buy three New England utilities from Iberdrola
for about $885 million. Iberdrola said it aims to use the
proceeds to help finance a $1.4 billion power line linking Maine
and Canada.  
 Iberdrola said in February it has a “flexible approach to
investment” and has committed to spend only 9.6 billion euros
of the estimated 16 billion-euro net investment through 2012. It
targets annual cost savings of 300 million euros by 2012.
Iberdrola does not need to carry out a capital increase, Galan
said today.  
 The company’s installed capacity totals 43,855 megawatts,
of which gas-fired plants account for 30 percent, renewable
energy 26 percent, hydropower units 22 percent, and nuclear
plants 7.6 percent.  
 Iberdrola Renovables SA , the utility’s renewable-energy
unit, aims to increase its installed capacity to 12,500
megawatts by the end of this year and 16,000 megawatts by 2012.
