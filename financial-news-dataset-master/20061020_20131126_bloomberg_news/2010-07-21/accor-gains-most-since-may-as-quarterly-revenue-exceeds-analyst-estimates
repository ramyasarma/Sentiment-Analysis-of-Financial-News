             Accor SA , Europe’s largest hotelier,
rose the most in  two months  in Paris trading after reporting
second-quarter sales that beat analyst estimates.  
 The  shares  rose as much as 5.1 percent, the most since May
10, and traded at 24.24 euros, a 4.6 percent advance, as of
10:41 a.m., giving the Evry, France-based company a market value
of 5.52 billion euros ($7.1 billion).  
 Excluding the services unit  spun off  this month, second-
quarter sales increased to 1.72 billion euros from 1.57 billion
euros a year earlier, beating the 1.64 billion-euro average
estimate from four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “Accor will go on benefiting from improvement in business
trends,”  Catherine Rolland , an analyst at Kepler Capital
Markets, said today in an e-mailed note. Rolland has a buy
rating on the stock and said Accor’s sales exceeded her
expectations.  
 European hotel occupancy rose almost 7 percent in May,
while revenue per available room rose 9 percent, the most this
year, according to researcher STR Global. Accor’s first-half
hotel sales increased 7.5 percent from a year earlier, when a
drop in business travel contributed to lower revenue.
