             Facebook Inc., the world’s most
popular social-networking service, reached 500 million users
today, up from about 400 million in February, Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  said.  
 The company is marking the milestone with a new application
called Facebook Stories, which lets users share their
experiences on the site, Zuckerberg said today on the company’s
 blog . The service, which supplanted News Corp.’s MySpace as the
No. 1 social network two years ago, started in 2004 at Harvard
University, where Zuckerberg was a student.  
 “I could have never imagined all of the ways people would
use Facebook when we were getting started six years ago,”
Zuckerberg wrote.  
 Facebook has overcome privacy concerns and increased
competition from companies like  Google Inc.  to stay on the
growth track. In May, the company simplified privacy settings to
make it easier for people to protect their personal data. The
millions of users have helped Facebook attract big-name
advertising, such as Starbucks Corp. and JetBlue Airways Corp.  
 Market researchers had already estimated that Facebook had
more than 500 million users. Reston, Virginia-based ComScore
Inc. pegged its users at more than 519 million in April, up from
411 million in September.
