             Reckitt Benckiser Plc , the maker of
Cillit Bang cleaners, agreed to buy SSL International Plc for
2.54 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) to add brands including Durex
condoms and Scholl footcare products.  
 Reckitt’s offer is worth 1,171 pence a share, 33 percent
more than SSL’s closing  price  yesterday. SSL rose as much as 34
percent in London trading, while Reckitt gained 4.8 percent.  
 The takeover will increase Reckitt’s health and personal-
care  sales  by more than 36 percent, to one third of the
company’s total net revenue, Chief Executive Officer  Bart Becht 
said in the statement. Reckitt expects cost savings of about 100
million pounds a year in the combined group by the end of 2012.  
 The purchase will immediately add to Reckitt’s earnings per
share, excluding restructuring charges, and “materially
enhance” the scale and critical mass of Reckitt Benckiser’s
business in China and Japan, the company said in the statement.
Buying SSL will also add two so-called Powerbrands to the
company, bringing Reckitt’s total to 19.  
 SSL  rose  as much as 308 pence to 1,190 pence in London
trading. Reckitt gained as much as 153 pence to 3,343 pence.  
 SSL shareholders will receive 1,163 pence a share and be
entitled to a dividend of 8 pence a share.  
 SSL directors, who were advised by JPMorgan Cazenove and
Lazard, intend to recommend the offer to shareholders. SSL
brands also include Mister Baby, Sauber and Paramol.
