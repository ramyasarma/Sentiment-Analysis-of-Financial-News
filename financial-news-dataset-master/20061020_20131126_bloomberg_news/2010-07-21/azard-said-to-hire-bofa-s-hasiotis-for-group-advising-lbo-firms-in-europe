             Lazard Ltd . is hiring  Fotis Hasiotis 
from Bank of America Corp. to co-run the group that advises
private-equity firms in Europe, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  
 Hasiotis will be based in London and run the group
alongside  Isabelle Xoual  in Paris, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the appointment isn’t yet
public. Hasiotis is expected to start in November, the person
said. Lazard spokesman  Richard Creswell  declined to comment.  
 Investment banks are beefing up teams after dealmaking
almost halted for two years because of the credit crisis.
Private-equity firms have led $68 billion of acquisitions this
year, an 88 percent increase from the same period in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lazard ranks 10th for
advice on global private-equity transactions this year, advising
on deals worth $3.8 billion.  
 Hasiotis was replaced in May as head of Bank of America’s
private-equity group in Europe, Middle East and Africa by
Deutsche Bank AG’s  Rob Firth . Firth will start next month and
report to  Christian Meissner , the investment-banking head for
EMEA who joined the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender from
Nomura Holdings Inc.
