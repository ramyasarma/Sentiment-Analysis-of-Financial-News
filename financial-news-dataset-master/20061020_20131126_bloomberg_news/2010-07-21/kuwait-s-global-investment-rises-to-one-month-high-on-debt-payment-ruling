             Global Investment House KSCC  rose
for a second day to the highest in almost one month after the
Kuwaiti bank said it repaid $50 million to creditor banks and a
Dubai court ordered National Bank of Umm Al-Qaiwain to return
$250 million to the lender.  
 The shares surged 8.9 percent to 61 fils, the highest level
since June 24, as of 11:06 a.m. in Kuwait.  
 Global has so far repaid $78.9 million of the principal
amount, or 46 percent of total repayments due by Dec. 10, as
part of a debt restructuring agreement reached in December last
year, the bank said in a statement yesterday.  
 Separately,  National Bank of Umm Al-Qaiwain  said it will
appeal a court ruling that required the United Arab Emirates-
based bank to return $250 million with interest and expenses to
Global Investment.
