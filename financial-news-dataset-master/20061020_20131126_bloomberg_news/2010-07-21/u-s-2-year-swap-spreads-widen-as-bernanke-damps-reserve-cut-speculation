             Two-year interest-rate swap spreads
widened for the first time in eight days after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  damped speculation that policy makers
were considering reducing the interest rate paid on reserves.  
 The U.S. central bank will need to increase that rate at
some point in the future when it begins lowering the support it
provides the economy, Bernanke said in testimony to Congress.
The two-year swap spread rebounded from a seven-week low.  
 “The slight risk of that happening is there no longer,”
said  Ian Lyngen,  a government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “There was a knee-jerk
reaction to the idea that the Fed could cut the interest rate on
reserves and you’ve seen a reversal of that as cooler heads
prevailed.”  
 The two-year swap spread was 1.15 basis points higher at
23.15 basis points at 4:05 p.m. in New York after climbing as
high as 24.75 before Bernanke’s comments. The five-year  swap
spread  was 0.37 basis point lower at 21.63 and the  10-year 
spread fell 0.69 basis points to 1.56 basis points.  
 Bernanke said during the question and answer period that
the Fed still has options if the recovery falters that include
lowering the reserve rate. Officials haven’t decided which tools
to use and each option has drawbacks, he said.
