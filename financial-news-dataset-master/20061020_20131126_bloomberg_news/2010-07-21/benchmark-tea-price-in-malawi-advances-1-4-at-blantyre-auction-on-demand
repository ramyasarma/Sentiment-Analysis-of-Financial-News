             The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi, Africa’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, rose
1.3 percent as good quality tea received strong bids from
buyers, Van Rees BV said.  
 The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.24 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, on July 20 compared with $2.21 a week ago,
Van Rees BV, a tea-trading unit of Netherlands-based NIBC
Principal Investments, said an e-mailed report today.  
 “There was strong demand for well-made tea and supplies
have reduced which is slowly driving prices up,”  Emmanuel Phiri , a manager at Van Rees, said in a telephone interview from
Blantyre.  
 Supplies almost halved to 114,620 kilograms from 228,720
kilograms a week earlier while revenue dropped 47 percent to
$170,009 from $318 861 on July 13, Van Rees said.  
 Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign-exchange earner
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi,
followed by South Africa and Kenya.
