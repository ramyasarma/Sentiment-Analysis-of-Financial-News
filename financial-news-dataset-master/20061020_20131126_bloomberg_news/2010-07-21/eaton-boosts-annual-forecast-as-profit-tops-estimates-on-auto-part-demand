             Eaton Corp.  climbed the most since
May in New York trading after boosting its full-year profit
forecast on rising demand for truck parts and hydraulic systems.  
 Full-year operating profit will be $4.90 to $5.10 a share,
the Cleveland-based company said in a statement today, topping
the $4.62 average analyst estimate from a Bloomberg survey. The
company also raised its dividend for the first time since 2008.  
 Sales of car and truck parts increased for the third
straight quarter as the automobile industry  ramped up production 
from the record-low levels set in early 2009. Eaton Chief
Executive Officer  Sandy Cutler  today projected end markets would
expand 8 percent in 2010, compared with an April forecast of 6
percent, even as economic growth has moderated in China.  
 Eaton has already experienced “trough earnings” as it
keeps reducing costs and demand stabilizes,  Andrew Casey , a
Boston-based analyst for Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note to
clients. “This should be positive for the stock.”  
 Eaton  climbed  $3.80, or 5.5 percent, to $72.86 at 10:55
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
rose as much as 5.8 percent earlier for the biggest intraday
increase since May 10.  
 Second-quarter  net income  jumped more than sevenfold to
$226 million, or $1.33 a share, from $29 million, or 17 cents, a
year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed 16 percent to
$3.38 billion. Profit excluding some items was $1.36 a share,
higher than the $1.17 average of 19 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 “As we survey our end markets, the year is shaping up to
be better than we had forecast,” Cutler said in the statement
as Eaton announced a 16 percent boost in its  quarterly dividend 
to 58 cents a share.  
 Segment Results  
 Eaton in April  forecast  2010 profit excluding some items of
$4.30 to $4.60 a share.  
 Revenue at the truck division  climbed 53 percent in the
quarter to $492 million, and Eaton predicts truck production
will increase in the second half from the first half. The
business makes transmissions and clutches for trucks and hybrid
power systems for vehicles used by United Parcel Service Inc.  
 Sales at Eaton’s automotive unit, which makes engine valves
and superchargers for cars, rose 44 percent to $389 million.  
 The hydraulics business posted a 34 percent jump in revenue
to $568 million, and Eaton now sees demand globally climbing 26
percent this year. It had forecast a 16 percent increase in
April.  
 Sales at the Electrical Americas unit, Eaton’s biggest
business, rose 1.5 percent to $894 million for the first gain
since the first quarter of 2009. The unit makes circuit
breakers, power-distribution systems and meters.
