             Refined-copper imports by  China , the
largest consumer of the metal used in construction and
automobiles, fell for a third month in June as lower domestic
prices discouraged overseas purchases and local output surged.  
 Inbound shipments  were 211,957 metric tons last month, the
Beijing-based customs office said today. That’s 24 percent less
than in May and 44 percent less than a year earlier, according
to Bloomberg calculations.  
 “The arbitrage window was mostly closed last month, so
there was little incentive to import,”  Zhao Kai , an analyst at
Jinrui Futures Co., said from Shenzhen. “However, demand
remains robust and we expect imports to pick up again in July.”  
 London futures traded at a premium to those in China,
dropping 3.5 percent over the month compared with 4.3 percent in
Shanghai. Arbitrage traders try to profit by buying metal in
London and selling it in Shanghai, exploiting the gap in prices.  
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.8 percent to $6,695.50 a ton today, and traded at
$6,662 at 2:48 p.m. in Singapore. The October contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange lost as much as 2.3 percent to 51,910
yuan ($7,662) a ton, before ending at 52,320 yuan. Chinese
prices include a 17 percent value-added tax and import fees.  
 “The increase in scrap copper imports, as well as the
large rise in production, also offset the drop in refined
imports,” said Li Ye, an analyst at Minmetals Starfutures Co.  
 Domestic production of the refined metal gained to a record
in June, offsetting the drop in imports. Today’s decline is in
line with the 17 percent drop in imports of both refined copper
and products for June, which was announced on July 10.  
 China’s imports of  copper scrap and waste  were 353,470 tons
in June, compared with May’s figure of 326,867 tons and 278,922
tons a year earlier.
