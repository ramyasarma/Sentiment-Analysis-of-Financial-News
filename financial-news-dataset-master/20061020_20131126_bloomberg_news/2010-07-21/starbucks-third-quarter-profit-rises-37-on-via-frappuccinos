             Starbucks Corp. , the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain, said third-quarter profit rose 37 percent on
sales of instant coffee and Frappuccino frozen drinks.  
 Net income  increased to $207.9 million, or 27 cents a
share, Seattle-based Starbucks said today in a statement. Sales
in the quarter ended June 27 advanced 8.7 percent to $2.61
billion. Excluding some items, earnings were in line with
analysts’ estimates.  
 A promotion that allowed customers to add free syrups and
toppings to their Frappuccinos boosted comparable-store sales by
2 percentage points, said Chief Financial Officer  Troy Alstead .
The company also started offering Via instant coffee in grocery
stores and last year began selling Seattle’s Best coffee in
fast-food chains like Subway to accelerate growth.  
 “We’re building Via as a growth platform over the next
five years,” Alstead said in a telephone interview. Starbucks
plans to increase its advertising spending by 2 cents a share in
the current quarter to push products including Via, he said.  
 The company raised its  forecast  for earnings this year to
as much as $1.23 a share, excluding projected restructuring
charges, and said that amount would increase to as much as $1.41
in fiscal 2011. Analysts on average project earnings of $1.42
for 2011, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Starbucks fell 52 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $24.65 at 5:57
p.m. New York time. The shares have increased 9.2 percent this
year in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .  
 Via in Japan  
 Starbucks expanded Via to more locations in the U.S., U.K.
and Japan during the quarter. Via sales in Japan have already
exceeded the company’s annual target for that region, Chief
Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said on a conference call. Via
is now available at 37,000 points of distribution, he said.  
 After closing almost 900 locations since 2008, Starbucks
also introduced free Wi-Fi service in remaining outlets during
the quarter and sought to revive its coffee shop business.  
 The company’s “However-You-Want-It Frappuccino”
promotion, started in May, has helped ward off competition from
McDonald’s Corp.’s new, less expensive frozen Frappe drinks,
said  Tom Forte , restaurant analyst with New York-based Telsey
Advisory Group. The free additions make the drinks seem like a
better deal, he said.  
 “We haven’t seen any impact on our business at all” from
the McDonald’s frappe drinks, Alstead said.  
 Sales at Starbucks stores open more than a year rose 9
percent in the third quarter, beating the 7 percent average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 7  analysts .  
 Net income in the year-earlier period totaled $151.5
million, or 20 cents a share.  
 Starbucks, which declared its first dividend in March,
raised its quarterly dividend to 13 cents a share from 10 cents
today.  
 (Starbucks held a conference call at 5 p.m. New York time.
