             Grupo Bimbo SAB , the world’s largest
bread maker, said second-quarter profit dropped as the U.S.
dollar weakened against the Mexican peso.  
 Net income fell to 1.3 billion pesos ($97.4 million) from
1.4 billion pesos in the year-earlier period, the Mexico City-
based company said today in a statement to the stock exchange.
Profit missed the 1.6-billion peso estimate from Citigroup Inc.  
 An increase in sales in Mexico, Bimbo’s largest market, was
offset by a drop in U.S. sales amid a “significantly lower
currency exchange rate,” Bimbo said in the statement.  
 The U.S., Bimbo’s second- largest market  after the company
acquired George Weston Foods Ltd.’s U.S. operations in 2009,
accounts for 44 percent of quarterly revenue. The Mexican peso
was, on average, 5.9 percent higher than the U.S. dollar in the
quarter than in the year-ago period.  
 “After a weak 2009, Mexico operations have regained the
growth,” Miguel Ulloa, a Citigroup analyst in Mexico City, said
in a report before earnings were released.  
 Bakery sales from Mexico rose 4.8 percent to 14 billion
pesos, while U.S. bread sales fell 3.9 percent. South and
Central America sales increased 1.4 percent from the prior year.  
 Quarterly revenue was little changed at 28.8 billion pesos
from 28.7 billion pesos last year.  
 Bimbo’s  debt climbed  7.8 percent to 45.6 billion pesos from
42.3 billion pesos last year.  
 “Bimbo has enough flexibility to again take up
acquisitions or reduce even more debt,” Ulloa said.  
 Candy Acquisition  
 Grupo Bimbo said June 23 it  agreed to buy  Dulces Vero, a
Mexican candy maker that had sales of 1.1 billion pesos in 2009.
The acquisition is subject to the approval of Mexican
authorities. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  
 Grupo Bimbo  rose 75 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 97.36
pesos on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 41
percent in the past year.  
 Bimbo makes Entenmann’s cakes, Thomas English Muffins, Pan
Bimbo and Mrs. Baird’s breads.
