             Copper demand is “stronger” than
U.S. economic signals suggest, said  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. , the world’s biggest publicly traded producer of the
metal.  
 “Physical markets are really stronger than economic
indicators in the U.S.,” Freeport Chief Executive Officer
 Richard Adkerson  said today on a conference call with investors.
“Our order books are filling up more strongly than they have in
some time.”  
 Rising demand in China, the world’s biggest buyer, and
supply constraints will combine to support copper prices,
Adkerson said. Phoenix-based Freeport is “very, very positive”
on the outlook for the metal, he said.  
 Copper futures have more than more than quadrupled since
2002 as mining companies struggled to keep up with rising
demand. Before today, prices dropped 10 percent this year on
concern that slowing U.S. growth would limit consumption.  
 “Issues with falling exchange stocks and issues with scrap
markets” signal limited supply for the metal, Adkerson said.  
 Freeport reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates because of higher-than-forecast sales of the
metal.  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 9.5 cents, or
3.2 percent, to $3.0965 a pound at noon on the Comex in New
York.
