             New World Resources NV , the largest
Czech supplier of coal to steelmakers, gained the most in two
months in Prague trading after saying it agreed with customers
to increase coking coal and coke prices in the third quarter.  
 The stock  jumped  as much as 7.8 percent and traded up 5.6
percent at 230.1 koruna as of 10 a.m. in Prague, its biggest
intraday advance since May 26. The country’s main  PX  gauge of 14
companies rose 1.1 percent.  
 NWR agreed to sell about 300 kilotons of mostly semisoft
coking coal at an average price of 158 euros ($203) per metric
ton, 17 percent up from the previous quarter, the Amsterdam-
based miner said today in a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service. The company expects to sell 250
kilotons of coke for 362 euros a ton, up 42 percent from the
previous quarter.  
 “This is positive news for NWR shares, especially the
magnitude of coke-price increases,” analyst  Josef Nemy  at
 Komercni Banka AS , the Prague-based unit of  Societe Generale SA ,
wrote in an e-mailed report. “NWR has never reached higher
quarterly coking coal and coke prices. The news confirms our
‘buy’ recommendation.”
