             News Corp.’s Fox Networks Group will
seek a Japanese government license for a second channel to offer
a digital satellite broadcasting service it wants to start next
year, Nikkei English News reported, citing an interview with Fox
Networks Chief Executive Officer Tony Vinciquerra.  
 About six new channels may be approved later this year to
use bandwidth now occupied by analog broadcast satellite
service, which will end in July 2011, Nikkei said. The
Communications Ministry is accepting applications through
tomorrow, Nikkei said.
