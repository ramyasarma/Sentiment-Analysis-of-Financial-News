             Portugal’s borrowing costs rose at
an auction of 1.253 billion euros ($1.61 billion) of 12-month
bills after yields surged in April and May amid Europe’s debt
crisis.  
 The securities due July 21, 2011 were issued at an average
yield of 2.452 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said today in Lisbon. That compares with an average yield of
1.036 percent at a March 17 auction of 12-month bills.  
 “It was a pretty reasonable auction,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at Barclays Capital in
London. Costs are higher but it’s “not an unsustainable level
to pay for its debt.”  
 Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal’s credit rating two
levels this month, citing prospects for weak economic growth and
growing debt. The government has raised taxes and cut spending
in an attempt to rein in a budget deficit of 9.3 percent of
output last year. The Finance Ministry on July 2 said that it
aims to narrow the shortfall a year earlier than previously
planned and meet the European Union’s 3 percent limit in 2012.  
 Borrowing costs among the euro-region’s high-deficit
nations have dropped from peaks in May after the EU devised a
440 billion-euro financial backstop in return for government-
austerity measures.  
 Today’s auction attracted bids for 1.3 times the amount
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.2 in the March
auction. The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on July 15 said
the indicative amount for today’s auction was 1.25 billion
euros.
