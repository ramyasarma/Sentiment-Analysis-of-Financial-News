             BlackRock Inc.  said second-quarter
profit rose 98 percent as the acquisition of Barclays Global
Investors boosted assets and fees.  
 Net income rose to $432 million, or $2.21 a share, from
$218 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier, the New York-
based firm said today in a statement. Excluding costs to
integrate BGI and certain compensation expenses,  earnings  of
$2.37 a share beat the $2.30 estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Clients withdrew a net $30.4 billion in the quarter as they
reassessed investments following the BGI deal, contributing to a
6.3 percent decline in assets  under management . Chief Executive
Officer  Laurence D. Fink , who built BlackRock from a fixed-
income firm into the world’s largest asset manager by adding the
biggest lineup of exchange-traded funds, last week reshuffled
management and set up three regional units to help integrate the
new business.  
 “The long-term flows improved but the churn got worse,”
 Jeffrey Hopson , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Inc. in
St. Louis, said in an interview. “The churn will run its
course, but I would like to see it run its course sooner rather
than later.” Hopson expected BlackRock to earn $2.40 a share,
excluding certain one-time items.  
 BlackRock had $33.9 billion in withdrawals from
quantitative funds and as clients reassessed their investments
after the merger. Cash funds lost $24.9 billion. Customers added
$28.4 billion to long-term products and the advisory business.  
 Market Declines  
 The withdrawals and stock market declines in the quarter
reduced assets under management to $3.15 trillion, from $3.36
trillion at the end of March. Equity market declines and foreign
exchange movements erased $194.1 billion during the quarter,
accounting for more than 90 percent of the drop in managed
assets.  
 BlackRock’s has declined 36 percent in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading this year, making it the worst
performer in the 202-member  Russell 1000 Financial Service
Index , which is down 1.4 percent. The stock surged 73 percent in
2009, four times the rate of index, helped by news of the BGI
purchase.  
 “Going into the merger we knew that some clients would
have to address concentration issues and that the active
quantitative style was under stress industrywide,” Fink said in
today’s statement. “As expected, these two issues continued to
drive outflows, and are expected to do so for at least another
quarter.”  
 Reshuffling Management  
 BlackRock last week named  Rich Kushel  as head of portfolio
management and  Charles Hallac  as chief operating officer, and
created three regional units for the Americas, Asia-Pacific, as
well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  James Charrington ,
58, will lead the EMEA region and  Rohit Bhagat , 46, will oversee
the Asia Pacific unit.  
 Investors in the U.S. deposited about $50 billion into
stock and bond mutual funds in the quarter ending June 30, with
most of that going into fixed-income funds, preliminary data
from the  Investment Company Institute  in Washington show.
Exchange-traded funds pulled in $30.5 billion during the
quarter, according to Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.  
 BlackRock, co-founded in 1988 by Fink, began as a fixed-
income firm and has expanded through a series of acquisitions.
In 2005, BlackRock bought State Street Research & Management to
add more stock, real estate and hedge funds. In 2006, it
expanded its equity business with the purchase of Merrill Lynch
& Co.’s money-management unit. In 2008, BlackRock acquired a
division of Quellos Group LLC to add hedge-fund assets. The
$15.2 billion purchase of BGI, the biggest seller of index-
tracking ETFs, was its largest takeover.
