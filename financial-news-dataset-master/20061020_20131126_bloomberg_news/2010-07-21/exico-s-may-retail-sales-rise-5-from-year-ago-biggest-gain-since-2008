             Mexican  retail sales  rose more than
analysts forecast in May even as violence tied to drug
trafficking reduced demand in the northern part of the country.  
 Sales climbed 5 percent from a year earlier, led by
stationary and clothing stores, the statistics agency said
today. Economists had predicted a rise of 3.4 percent, according
to the median estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg . The
increase, while benefitting from a low base set last year as
swine flu and the global credit crisis slashed demand, was the
biggest since a 7.3 percent gain in April 2008  
 Demand trailed the rest of the country in cities along the
U.S. border including Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo, dropping
from last year’s levels, the report showed. Northern Mexico is
the site of some of the bloodiest violence related to the
illicit drug trade, including a shooting earlier this week at a
party in Torreon that left 17 people dead and 18 injured.  
 “Many U.S. citizens used to go shopping in those cities,
and now they’re thinking twice,” said  Ricardo Aguilar , an
economist at Invex Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City.  
 Drug cartels fighting for routes to smuggle cocaine and
marijuana into the U.S. have increased the pace of killings in
the region. Mexico has reported almost 25,000 deaths since
December 2006 related to organized crime.  
 The government estimates violence shaves 1 percentage point
from gross domestic product each year.

p.m. New York time from 12.7743 yesterday.
