             Europe’s Champions League will be
one of several competitions to use two extra assistant referees
after soccer officials approved the system for another season.  
 The technical subcommittee of the International Football
Association Board, the sport’s rules-maker, approved the plan at
a meeting today in Cardiff, Wales. The IFAB is made up of world
governing body FIFA and the English, Scottish, Northern Irish
and Welsh soccer associations.  
 Europe’s second-tier Europa League cup competition last
season used the system, which placed an assistant referee behind
each goal line. The Champions League and UEFA Super Cup were
added this season, as well as other competitions worldwide. The
experiment is scheduled to continue until 2012, the IFAB said in
a statement.  
 The board also said the issue of goal-line technology would
be discussed at a meeting in October.  
 Calls for the introduction of technology increased after
England’s  Frank Lampard  had a tying goal disallowed during a
World Cup second-round match loss to Germany last month. His
shot hit the underside of the crossbar and landed over the goal
line but was unseen by match officials, with television replays
clearly showing it as a goal.  
 FIFA President  Sepp Blatter  later said technology would be
discussed at today’s meeting, but it wasn’t on the agenda. The
IFAB in March decided against the use of goal-line technology.
