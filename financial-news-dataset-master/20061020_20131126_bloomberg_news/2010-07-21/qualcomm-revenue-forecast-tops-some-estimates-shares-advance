             Qualcomm Inc. , the biggest maker of
chips that run mobile phones, rose in extended trading after the
company said it expects higher profit and selling prices for
devices based on its technology.  
 The company, which gets the majority of its profit from
licensing technology calculated as a percentage of the price of
a phone, predicted higher estimated average selling prices in
the current period, according to a statement today.  
 “The worst seems to be over for them,” said  Anil Doradla ,
an analyst at William Blair & Co. in  Chicago. “The key metrics
that investors are looking for with Qualcomm are turning
around.”  
 Qualcomm shares slumped  22 percent  this year as investors
fretted that the company wasn’t getting its chips and technology
into enough of the most profitable smartphones. Average selling
prices will be $184 to $188, San Diego-based Qualcomm said. That
compares with a previous forecast of $182 to $188.  
 Qualcomm , whose code division multiple access, or CDMA,
technology is the basis of third-generation phones, rose $1.84,
or 5.1 percent, to $38 in late trading. The shares fell 59 cents
to $36.16 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  
 Consumers snapped up more smartphones and Qualcomm got more
of its chips in those phones, Chief Financial Officer  Bill Keitel  said in a telephone interview. That helps Qualcomm’s chip
sales and licensing revenue, he said.  
 “We’re seeing an acceleration in demand for data-capable
phones,” Keitel said. “The smartphone market is pretty good in
the U.S.”  
 Third-Quarter Sales  
 The company also raised its 2010 profit  forecast  and
reported third-quarter sales that topped some analysts’
estimates, a sign that demand for phones is picking up.  
 Profit in the year ending in September will be $1.82 to
$1.86 a share, up from a previous forecast of $1.71 to $1.82.
Revenue this quarter will be $2.67 billion to $2.93 billion,
exceeding the $2.77 billion average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Net  income  rose 4.1 percent to $767 million, or 47 cents a
share, in the three months ended June 27, from $737 million, or
44 cents, a year earlier. Sales were $2.71 billion. Analysts had
predicted third-quarter profit of 43 cents a share on revenue of
$2.64 billion.  
 The company shipped about 103 million CDMA-based MSM
chipsets in the quarter, up 10 percent from a year earlier. It
expects to ship 106 million to 111 million this quarter.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Paul Jacobs  said on a conference
call today after earnings were released that the U.S. and China
are driving demand for chipsets.  
 Fourth-quarter  profit  will be 39 cents to 43 cents,
Qualcomm said. That compares with 46 cents, the  average  of
analysts’ projections compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Separately, the company said it’s disappointed with the
performance of its MediaFLO mobile-television division. Qualcomm
is in talks with other companies for a possible sale or
partnership, Keitel said.
