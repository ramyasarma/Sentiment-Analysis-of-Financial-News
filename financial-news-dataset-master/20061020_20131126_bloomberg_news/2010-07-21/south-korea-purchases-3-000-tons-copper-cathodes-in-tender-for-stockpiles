               South Korea ,  Asia ’s third-biggest
buyer of base metals including copper and aluminum, bought 3,000
metric tons of copper cathodes in a tender today at a higher
premium than last month, according to a state agency.  
 The Public Procurement Service, a state body that manages
commodities, purchased the metal of Zambian origin from Glencore
International AG at $146 a ton more than the London Metal
Exchange official cash settlement price on a cost, insurance and
freight basis, according to agency official Yang Young Ho.  
 The price is higher than the $110-a-ton premium over the
same benchmark that the agency paid LS-Nikko Copper Inc. in the
last such  tender  on June 28.  
 The LME-registered grade-A copper cathode, used in
electrical wiring and pipes, is due for shipment by Sept. 15,
with 2,500 tons to be delivered at the port of Incheon and the
rest into Busan.  
 In a separate tender today, the agency purchased from
Glencore 300 tons of Norwegian nickel due for shipment by Sept.
15, Yang said.  
 Of the total, the buyer paid $1,000 per ton more than the
LME official cash settlement price for 200 tons with minimum
purity of 99.8 percent, Yang said. It paid $1,225 a ton over the
same benchmark for the remainder, with minimum purity of 99.95
percent, he said. The prices are on a cost, insurance and
freight basis.  
 Copper for three-month delivery in  London  climbed 1.8
percent to $6,760 a ton at 6:13 p.m. Seoul time and three-month
nickel advanced 1 percent to $19,320 a ton.
