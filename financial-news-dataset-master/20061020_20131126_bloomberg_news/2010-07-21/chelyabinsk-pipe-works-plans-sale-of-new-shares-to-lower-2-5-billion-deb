             OAO Chelyabinsk Pipe Works , the
biggest plant of Russia’s ChelPipe Group, called an
extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on Aug. 20 to vote on a sale
of new shares, according to a regulatory filing.  
 ChelPipe, Russia’s third-largest pipemaker, is seeking to
reduce its debt, which almost doubled in the past three years to
75 billion rubles ($2.5 billion) as it built two plants.  
 Sergey Rybak, a spokesman for ChelPipe in Chelyabinsk,
declined to give details of the share sale.
