             Several German ministries will
review some savings measures under the country’s budget cut plan
and propose changes where necessary,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing an unidentified government official.  
 German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  asked for a reassessment of the plans, the
newspaper said.  
 Items under review include a tax on new fuel rods for
nuclear power plants, a departure tax for airline passengers,
and the role of the finance ministry with regard to company
insolvencies, Handelsblatt said.  
 The ministries will propose alternative solutions in coming
weeks, Handelsblatt said. The overall target for the budget cuts
won’t be changed, the newspaper said.
