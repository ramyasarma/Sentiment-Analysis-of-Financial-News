             Volkswagen AG will probably begin
building an engine plant in Mexico in September, to supply its
North American assembly lines starting in 2013,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing  Wolfgang Hatz , VW’s head of engine development.  
 Locating the plant in the U.S. is still an option, “but it
looks like it’s going to be northern Mexico,” Hatz was quoted
as saying.
