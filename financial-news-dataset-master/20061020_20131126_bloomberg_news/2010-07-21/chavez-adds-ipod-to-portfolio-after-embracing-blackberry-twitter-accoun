             Venezuela’s socialist President  Hugo Chavez  said he was given an  Apple Inc.  iPod to listen to music
just months after acquiring his first BlackBerry smartphone and
opening a  Twitter Inc.  account.  
 Chavez, who said that technology isn’t capitalist on April
29, today called on his followers to use new technology to
spread socialist ideas.  
 “There’s so much technology now, I’ve got a little
apparatus that my daughter gave me that’s called an iPod,”
Chavez said today on state television during a cultural event in
Caracas. “I have like 5,000 songs. It’s tiny, I remember having
to go around with a bunch of cassette tapes before.”  
 Chavez, a 55-year-old former army paratrooper, began to use
his BlackBerry phone made by  Research In Motion Ltd.  in April as
a way to connect with his followers and has used the Twitter
social networking site to announce the sinking of an offshore
natural gas platform and the exhumation of 19th-century
independence hero  Simon Bolivar .  
 Chavez is from the central plains state of Barinas, which
is known for  Joropo music  using harps and four stringed guitars.
He often sings during speeches that last as long as six hours.
