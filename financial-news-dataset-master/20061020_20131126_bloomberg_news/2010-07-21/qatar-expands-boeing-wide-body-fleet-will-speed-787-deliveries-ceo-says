             Qatar Airways Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer  Akbar Al Baker  said he’s moved past his “issues” with
Boeing Co. and aims to expand his wide-body fleet with more 777s
and 787 Dreamliners.  
 The carrier, half owned by the Persian Gulf country,
ordered two more 777s today and said at the Farnborough Air Show
near London that it plans to buy another three soon. It also
will accelerate delivery of 30 787s on order and will consider
buying 30 more, possibly to lease to other airlines.  
 The moves contrast with Al Baker’s comments last year, when
he threatened to cancel an order for 30 Dreamliners if the new
plastic-composite model was further delayed and said that the
Chicago-based planemaker was being run by “bean-counters.”
Production of the Dreamliner is 2 1/2 years behind schedule.  
 “I had some issues, and everything is now on track for our
relationship not only to continue on the firm 787s, but see how
we can develop that even further on the 30 options we also
hold,” he said at a press conference today.  
 Today’s accord, valued at $501 million, brings Qatar
Airways’ order of 777 wide-body jets to 10. The carrier’s fleet
includes 19 of Boeing’s second-largest aircraft.  
 The airline aims to take delivery of its first 787 jet in
the fourth quarter of next year, and to have five in service by
the end of the first quarter of 2012, Al Baker said, adding that
he’s further negotiating delivery options for all 30.  
 “We’ve had a number of customers decide they want to take
airplanes later, and it allows other customers like Qatar to
take their place in the queue,” Boeing Commercial Airplanes
President  Jim Albaugh  said.  
 The $178 million Dreamliner was on display at the air show
until yesterday, in the model’s first European appearance. Qatar
Airways was initially supposed to get its first 787 this year.
The plane has been delayed by parts shortages, redesigns and
problems with the new materials and production system.
