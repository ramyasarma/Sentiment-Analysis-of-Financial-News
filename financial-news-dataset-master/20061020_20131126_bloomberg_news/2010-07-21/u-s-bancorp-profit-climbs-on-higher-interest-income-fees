             U.S. Bancorp , the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank, posted a 63 percent increase in second-quarter profit as
income from lending and fee-generating businesses grew after the
purchase of failed lenders.  
 Net income  advanced to $766 million, or 45 cents a share,
from $471 million, or 12 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp said today in a
statement. Twenty-seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg had an
average profit estimate of 38 cents a share. Profit in the year-
earlier period included a $123 million accrual for a special
assessment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis ,52, has overseen the
lender’s U.S.-assisted  purchases  of failed banks and thrifts,
with more than 200 offices and assets topping $35 billion over
the past two years. U.S. Bancorp’s return on assets and return
on equity have  outpaced  nine other large U.S. banks since Jan.
1, 2008, according to a May investor presentation.  
 “Their FDIC-assisted acquisitions have been a nice strategy
because there is favorable accounting and they bought them early
in the cycle,”  Anton Schutz , president of Mendon Capital
Advisors in Rochester, New York, said yesterday. His firm owned
100,000 US Bancorp shares as of March 31.
