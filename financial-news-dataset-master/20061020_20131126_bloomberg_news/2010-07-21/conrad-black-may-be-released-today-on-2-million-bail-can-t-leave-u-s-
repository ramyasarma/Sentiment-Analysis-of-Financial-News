             Conrad Black, the former Hollinger
International Inc. chairman, was granted $2 million bail
guaranteed by a family friend and may be released from a federal
prison as early as today.  
 U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve in Chicago granted
Black’s request for bail and said he’s not permitted to leave
the U.S. at this time. Black, 65, has been in the low-security
Coleman Federal Correctional Institution since March 2008. He’s
appealing his fraud conviction.
