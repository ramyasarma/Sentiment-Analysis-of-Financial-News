             Khazanah Nasional Bhd. , Malaysia’s
sovereign wealth fund, sold a 581.3 million ringgit ($181
million) stake in state-controlled  Telekom Malaysia Bhd.  as part
of the government’s plans to reduce its local business holdings.  
 Khazanah sold 178.9 million shares, or 5 percent of the
fixed-line phone and Internet service provider, at a fixed price
of 3.25 ringgit apiece, according to a statement by joint
placement agents Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. and Nomura
Singapore Ltd. today.  
 That’s a 2.7 percent discount to the stock’s 3.34 ringgit
closing  price  in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. Maybank rose 0.4
percent to close at 7.70 ringgit today. “There was strong
demand from both domestic and foreign institutional investors
for the placement,” the statement said.  
 Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said on March 30 that state-
linked institutions will cut public-company holdings to free up
shares and attract foreign investors to Malaysia, part of a plan
that may also almost halve its budget deficit in the next five
years, reduce expenses and make Malaysia more competitive.  
 The divestiture plan “has been on the agenda for a while.
They’re just timing it rightly,” said  Pankaj Kumar , who
oversees about $560 million as chief investment officer of
Kurnia Insurans Malaysia Bhd. “It shows that investors now have
an appetite for it.”  
 Asset Sales  
 Khazanah, a state investment agency whose investments
climbed 63 percent in value to 54.1 billion ringgit last year,
trimmed its holdings in power producer  Tenaga Nasional Bhd. ,
toll-road operator  PLUS Expressways Bhd.  and  Malaysia Airports
Holdings Bhd.  in 2009. It also plans to sell its 32.2 percent
stake in Pos Malaysia Bhd., a national postal company.  
 The Employees Provident Fund, a state-controlled pension
fund, accounts for half of daily trading volume in Malaysia’s
local equity and bond markets, Najib said.  
 The investment agency may raise 3 billion ringgit to 3.5
billion ringgit from divestments this year, Managing Director
 Azman Mokhtar  said in January.  
 The agency, which currently makes 12 percent of its
investments outside Malaysia, will explore more international
acquisitions in Asia, Azman said on March 23. It is currently
competing with Fortis Healthcare Ltd. to take over Singapore-
listed  Parkway Holdings Ltd. , Asia’s biggest hospital operator.
