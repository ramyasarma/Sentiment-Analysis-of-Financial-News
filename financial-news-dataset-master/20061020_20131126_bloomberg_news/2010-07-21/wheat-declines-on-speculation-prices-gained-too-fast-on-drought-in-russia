             Wheat futures rose in Chicago and
Paris for the first day in four on renewed concern that a
drought in Russia and Kazakhstan may cut supplies. Corn and
soybeans also gained.  
 September-delivery wheat advanced 1.1 percent to $5.8325 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time.
Milling wheat for November delivery on NYSE Liffe climbed as
much as 2.2 percent.  
 Chicago wheat futures rallied 24 percent in July’s first
half on concern that drought in Russia will curb global supply,
before sliding 3.2 percent in the past three sessions. Russia
was the third-largest wheat grower in the 2009-10 season,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 There are “still major doubts about the Russian
situation,” as well as a “new reduction of harvest estimates
in Kazakhstan with the heat wave,” Paris-based farm adviser
Agritel said in a comment on its website today.  
 Russia yesterday declared emergencies in six more crop-
producing regions due to the worst drought in at least a decade,
bringing the total to 23. Kazakhstan’s grain crop will be
between 13.5 million and 14.5 million metric tons, 1 million
tons below the range announced on July 8, Novosti-Kazakhstan
reported, citing Agriculture Minister Akylbek Kurishbayev.  
 Milling wheat rose 3.25 euros, or 1.9 percent, to 171.25
euros ($219.47) a ton on NYSE Liffe in the French capital,
paring an advance as high as 171.75 euros.  
 December-delivery corn gained 1 percent to $3.915 a bushel
in Chicago, and November-delivery soybeans climbed 0.5 percent
to $9.7825 a bushel.
