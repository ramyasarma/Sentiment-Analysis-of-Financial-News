             Standard Bank Group Ltd ., Africa’s
largest lender, and two South African rivals may still be
interested in buying stakes in distressed Nigerian banks after
the sale drew closer this week.  
 Standard Bank, the Johannesburg-based lender with
operations in 17 African countries including Nigeria, is “still
part of the process,” spokesman  Erik Larsen  said yesterday.
 FirstRand Ltd.  and  Nedbank Group Ltd.  said they may also be
involved in the bidding.  
 Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on July 19 approved a
bill creating a company to buy back $10 billion of bad debt from
the 10 banks rescued last year. While as many as 15 foreign and
local companies registered last year to investigate buying
stakes, Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said last month that
he expects only three international banks to join private-equity
firms and local banks in the bidding.  
 “We are continuing to pursue our options on a number of
different fronts, including the Central Bank of Nigeria
process,”  Sam Moss , investor relations director at  FirstRand ,
said in an e-mail yesterday.  
 Nedbank  will act in a “supportive role” to its Togo-based
partner  Ecobank Transnational Inc.  in considering the process,
Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said yesterday. Ecobank,
which agreed to cooperate with Nedbank at the end of 2008,
already has operations in Nigeria.  
 Nigeria’s banking index rose the most in almost four months
when Jonathan signed the Asset Management Corp. into law.
