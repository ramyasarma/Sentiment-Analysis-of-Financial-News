             A strike over pay by workers at
Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s largest export facility for
the fuel, ended after workers accepted a 9.5 percent pay
increase as part of a three-year wage agreement, the terminal
said.  
 Employees are back at work today, the terminal said in an
e-mailed statement.
