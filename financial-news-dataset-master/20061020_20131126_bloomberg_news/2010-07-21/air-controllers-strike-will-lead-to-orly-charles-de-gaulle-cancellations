             Air France SA  expects to cancel up
to half its flights at some French airports as air traffic
controllers strike.  
 France’s largest airline said on its website that it will
maintain all its long-distance flights. It expects to cancel 20
percent of its domestic and European flights at Roissy-Charles
de Gaulle airport and 50 percent at Orly. The cancellations were
requested two days ago by France’s civil aviation authority.  
 Aeroports de Paris SA , which manages the two main Paris
airports, didn’t have a prediction of how many flights will take
off today, saying on its  website  that passengers should contact
their airline.  
 The controllers are protesting against a plan to merge the
French air traffic system into a wider European system, which
they fear will cause them to lose their French civil service
status.  
 CGT, France’s largest union which called today’s strike
with four other unions, said on its website that the
reorganization would have “heavy social consequences”
including “the removal of part or all of the services and
personnel from the civil service.”  
 MeteoFrance , the state weather system, is predicting stormy
weather for today which could further disrupt traffic.
