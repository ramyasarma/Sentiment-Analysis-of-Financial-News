             General Electric Co. , the world’s
largest maker of jet engines, led the order tally with more than
$16.1 billion in equipment and service deals in the first three
days of the Farnborough Air Show as demand rebounds.  
 About $3 billion came from Emirates’ order for Boeing 777-
ERs, which exclusively use the GE90 engine. Emirates also placed
a $4.8 billion-order for Engine Alliance’s GP7200 to power the
32 A380s the carrier ordered last month. Engine Alliance is co-
owned by GE and  United Technologies Corp. ’s Pratt & Whitney.  
 “The level of activity at the show demonstrates that the
aviation industry is beginning to emerge from the economic
downturn,” GE Aviation Chief Executive Officer  David Joyce 
said.  
 GE beat its own prediction for the show, which began this
week, of securing $13 billion in orders. The total includes
partners Safran SA, which makes CFM International engines with
GE, and the Engine Alliance. GE’s orders, which peaked in 2007,
have been stoked by record backlogs of engines for narrow-body
planes such as  Boeing Co.’s 737  and  Airbus SAS’s A320 .  
 This week, lessors including GE’s plane-leasing unit and
 Steven Udvar-Hazy ’s Air Lease Corp., ordered more than 200
narrow-body aircraft. Emirates was the largest airline to order
new planes.  
 Pratt’s orders along with partners totaled $3.65 billion to
customers such as Malaysia Airlines, which ordered engines
valued at $680 million for 17 Airbus A330s. Rolls-Royce Group
Plc announced about $1.61 billion in deals. Both Pratt & Whitney
and Rolls-Royce account for about one-third of the International
Aero Engines partnership for engines on Airbus’s A320.  
 The GE-Safran partnership provides engines exclusively for
737s and competes with IAE on the A320, while the Engine
Alliance with Pratt & Whitney provides turbines for Airbus’s
A380 model, competing with a solo offering from Rolls-Royce.
