             The U.S. government has delivered
only about 9 percent of the $1.6 billion in drug-war aid
promised to Mexico and Central America under a 2008 accord as
violence across the border reaches an all-time high.  
 U.S. agencies were forced to delay delivering training and
equipment included in the Merida Initiative because they lacked
staff and funding, the U.S. Government Accountability Office
determined in a report, a draft of which was provided by the
office of Congressman  Eliot Engel , Chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. The GAO will
present the report in testimony before Congress tomorrow.  
 The shortfall in U.S. assistance hurts President  Felipe Calderon ’s fight against organized crime, said  Adam Isacson ,
senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America, a
human rights and economy research group. Armed groups in
northern Mexico murdered political candidates in this year’s
regional elections and have expanded their tactics, including
detonating a car bomb in Ciudad Juarez last week.  
 “When you consider the urgency with which politicians talk
about violence in Mexico and the threat it poses to us, to have
only delivered 9 percent after two years is pretty remarkable,”
Isacson said in a telephone interview from Washington.  
 Mexico has reported nearly 25,000 deaths related to
organized crime since Calderon took office in December 2006.  
 The Merida Initiative, supported by President  George W. Bush , pledged aircraft, boats, drug-sniffing dogs and youth
education programs, with about $1.3 billion of the funding
promised to Mexico, the GOA report said. The $141.2 million in
assistance delivered thus far includes 5 Textron Inc. Bell
helicopters and 13 armored General Motors Co. Chevrolet Suburban
sport-utility vehicles, the report showed.  
 Economic Threat  
 The impact of violence is the biggest threat to the Mexican
economy according to 57 percent of Mexican executives, up from
49 percent in March and 22 percent in December 2009, a  survey 
published today by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu showed.  
 The second-most cited concern was a U.S. economic slowdown,
according to the June 7-29 poll of 381 Mexican business leaders.  
 “The U.S. economic situation and political discord in our
country have lost importance in the view of executives as the
main threat for the economic development of Mexico,” Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu said.  
 The government estimates violence shaves 1 percentage point
from gross domestic product each year.  
 Mexico’s drug-related killings in 2010 rose to 7,048
through mid-July, according to Attorney General  Arturo Chavez Chavez .
