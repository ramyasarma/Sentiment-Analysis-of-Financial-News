             The National Hockey League rejected
 Ilya Kovalchuk ’s 17-year, $102 million contract, saying the New
Jersey Devils tried to get around salary cap rules,  TSN
reported , without saying where it got the information.  
 The record agreement calls for the 27-year-old Kovalchuk to
receive $95 million during the first 10 years and $7 million
during the last seven seasons, TSN’s website said.  
 Under the accord, Kovalchuk would earn $6 million in the
first two seasons, $11.5 million from 2012-17 and $10.5 million
the following season, the  Star-Ledger  of Newark, New Jersey,
reported. The salary eventually would fall to $550,000 in the
final five years. Kovalchuk would be 44 in 2027 when the
contract expires.  
 The collective bargaining agreement allows players who sign
before the age of 35 to have their contracts removed from the
salary cap at retirement. The team, however, must make an effort
to write a contract that will keep the player in the league for
its duration.  
 The annual hit of $6 million a year puts the Devils over
their $59.4 million cap for 2010-11, according to the NHL
website. Teams can be over the cap by 10 percent until the
season begins.  
 Kovalchuk was sent to the Devils in a five-player trade on
Feb. 4 with the Atlanta Thrashers, who had offered him a 12-year
extension worth $101 million, TSN reported. During the final 27
games of the regular season, he scored 10 goals and had 17
assists for the Devils.  
 Kovalchuk, who spent his first seven NHL seasons with the
Thrashers, is a two-time 50-goal scorer and three-time All-Star
with 40 or more goals in six consecutive seasons.  
 NHL spokeswoman  Bernadette Mansur  didn’t immediately answer
an e-mail seeking comment.
