             The Treasury will sell $105 billion
in 2-, 5- and 7-year notes next week, the smallest monthly
offering of the securities since June 2009, according to a
survey of primary dealers required to bid on the sales.  
 It would be the third straight month the government has
lowered its offering of the notes, and the lowest total since it
sold $104 billion of them 13 months ago. The U.S. budget deficit
in June shrank from a year earlier, to $68.4 billion from $94.3
billion, the Treasury reported on July 13. Even so, the deficit
this fiscal year is forecast to reach a record $1.6 trillion as
the government funds efforts to revive growth and employment.  
 “The Treasury is telling you that it’s right-sized its
borrowing” in line with the deficit, said  Steven Ricchiuto ,
chief economist at primary dealer Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in
New York. “There’s a window now where they have the luxury of
not having to borrow as much near-term, and so they are cutting
back, although they are still relatively high.”  
 The government sold $108 billion in 2-, 5- and 7-year debt
in June and $113 billion in May. It will announce the amounts
for this month’s auctions tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time. The
sales will be on three consecutive days beginning July 27.  
 The U.S. will auction $39 billion in 2-year notes, $37
billion in 5-year securities and $29 billion in 7-year debt,
according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey of
10 of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  
 At $39 billion, the two-year note auction would be the
lowest in size since December 2008. At $37 billion, the five-
year offering size would be the smallest since June 2009, while
a $29 billion sale of seven-year securities would be the lowest
since September.  
 ‘Heavy Lifting’ Done  
 Matthew Rutherford , the Treasury’s deputy assistant
secretary for federal finance, said earlier this year the
department was confident the “deficit situation” would improve
and that auction sizes had reached their peak. “The heavy
lifting is done,” he said at a Feb. 3 press conference.  
 “The longer-term trend is for them to be cutting, but
short-term uncertainty with regard to the economy and fiscal
outlook may cause them to pause this month,” said  Drew Matus ,
senior U.S. economist at primary dealer UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut. “The revenue stream from the U.S. government is
volatile and could cause negative as well as upside surprises.”  
 UBS estimates the Treasury will sell $108 billion of the
three maturities.
