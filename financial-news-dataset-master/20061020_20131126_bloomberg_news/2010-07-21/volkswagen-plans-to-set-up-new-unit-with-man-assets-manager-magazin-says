             Volkswagen AG  plans to integrate MAN
SE’s Diesel & Turbo unit and the transmission-making Renk
division into a new industrial unit together with its block heat
and power plant business after acquiring the truckmaker,  Manager
Magazin  reported, without citing anyone.  
 Volkswagen’s truck unit will include MAN, Scania AB and VW
brands, while its light-truck operations unit will be joined
with the car division, the German magazine reported. It’s not
clear what Volkswagen will do with MAN’s printing-press maker
Manroland, Manager Magazin said.  
 MAN spokesman  Dominique Nadelhofer  declined to comment on
the report when reached by Bloomberg News.  Christine Ritz , a
spokeswoman for VW, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
