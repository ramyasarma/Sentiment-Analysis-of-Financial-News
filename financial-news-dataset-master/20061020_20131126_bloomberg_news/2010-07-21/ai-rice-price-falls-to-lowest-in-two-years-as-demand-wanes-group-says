             Thai rice prices, the benchmark for
Asia, declined for a fourth week to the lowest level in more
than two years as demand declined, according to the Thai Rice
Exporters Association.  
 The  price  of 100-percent grade-B white rice fell 1.1
percent to $458 a metric ton from a week earlier, said Pisanu
Sangyoo, an official at the association. That’s the lowest level
since January 2008, when the price averaged $399, according to
data from the association’s  website . The price of  25-percent
broken rice  dropped to $395 a ton from $397 on July 14.  
 Thailand is the world’s biggest rice exporter and the grain
is the region’s most important food. Cheaper prices may help to
curb inflation across the region and cut living costs for
millions of people.  
 “Prices may weaken further due to an absence of import
orders from major buyers,” said Kiattisak Kanlayasirivat, a
director at Novel Commodities SA’s Thai office, which trades
about $600 million worth of rice a year. “Thai prices are also
losing competitiveness compared with those of Vietnam, which is
about $100 ton cheaper.”  
 Thailand’s white rice may tumble to $400 a ton around the
end of the year, Kiattisak said.  
 Rice futures in Chicago, which peaked last December at
$16.27 per 100 pounds on concern that India may become a net
importer for the first time in more than two decades, traded
today at $10.02 per 100 pounds.  
 The Thai association sets prices weekly.
