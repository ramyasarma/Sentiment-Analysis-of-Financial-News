             Knight Capital Group Inc. , the
largest trader of U.S. shares, reported profit that  beat 
analysts’ estimates after the biggest equity losses since the
bull market began in March 2009 spurred more transactions.  
 Knight reported second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 58 cents a share,  topping  the average projection
of 41 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts. The Jersey
City, New Jersey-based company said in a statement that net
income from businesses it still owns rose 14 percent from a year
earlier to $54.4 million.  
 The measure of stock-market swings known as 30-day
 historical volatility  averaged 20.9 during the April-through-
June period for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the highest
quarterly total in a year. The benchmark measure of U.S.
equities lost 16 percent between April 23 and July 2. Knight
gets most of its revenue from commissions for handling
transactions and making markets.  
 “Knight makes good money in a volatile market,”  Richard Repetto , a New York-based analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “ A key question
will be sustainability of  revenue  capture in different market
environments and/or diversification efforts at or near the
current elevated earnings level.”  
 Knight, which moved its share listing to the New York Stock
Exchange from the Nasdaq Stock Market last quarter, fell 2.1
percent to $13.89 at 4 p.m. New York time. The stock has fallen
9.8 percent in 2010,  compared  with a 12 percent decline in the
NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index that tracks Knight and 10 rivals
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 The company said today that revenue from trading surged 39
percent, helping drive total sales to $366.3 million for the
period ended June 30. That beat the average projection of $313.6
million in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  
 “Knight’s strong results in the second quarter of 2010
were aided by an upturn in volatility following five straight
quarters of declines,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Thomas Joyce  said in today’s statement.
