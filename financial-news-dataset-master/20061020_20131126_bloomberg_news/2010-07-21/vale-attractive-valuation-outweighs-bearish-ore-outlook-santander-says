             Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, trades at an attractive valuation that outweighs
probable declines in prices for the steelmaking ingredient,
Banco Santander SA said.  
 Vale shares have dropped 19 percent from their high this
year on April 14 amid concern slowing Chinese economic growth
will hurt demand. The stock  trades  for 8.9 times analysts’
earnings estimates, the least since April 2009, according to
weekly data compiled by Bloomberg. Vale’s price reflects
expectations that iron ore prices will drop more than is likely,
according to Santander, leaving room for the company to rally.  
 “Vale offers decent upside and an attractive valuation even
under a bearish short-term scenario for iron ore prices,”
Santander analysts led by  Felipe Reis  wrote in a note to clients
today. “Most of the negative momentum in iron ore spot prices
is behind us. There is a very strong earnings momentum for
Vale.”  
 Vale is producing iron ore at full capacity as Chinese-led
demand rebounds, Claudio Alves, the company’s director for iron-
ore sales in the Americas, said yesterday.
