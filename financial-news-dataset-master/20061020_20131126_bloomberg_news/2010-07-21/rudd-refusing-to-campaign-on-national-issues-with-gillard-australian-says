             Kevin Rudd won’t be cooperating with
Prime Minister Julia Gillard to campaign on national issues
ahead of the Aug. 21 election, the Australian newspaper reported
on its website. Rudd will campaign only on local issues as he
defends his seat of Griffith, a suburb of Brisbane, the
newspaper said, citing the former prime minister. Rudd declined
to say if he’ll commit to serving another full
term in parliament if reelected, according to the report.
