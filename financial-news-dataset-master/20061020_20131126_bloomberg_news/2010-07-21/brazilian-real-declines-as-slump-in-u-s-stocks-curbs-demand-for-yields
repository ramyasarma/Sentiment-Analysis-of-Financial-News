             Brazil’s real fell after a slump in
U.S. stocks eroded demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  
 The real declined 0.4 percent to 1.7808 per dollar, from
1.7742 yesterday.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.3 percent after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said today in testimony
to the Senate Banking Committee the economic outlook remains
“unusually uncertain” without offering additional measures to
stimulate growth.  
 “The real was tracking U.S. equities most of the day,”
said  Eduardo Suarez , an emerging-markets strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in Toronto. “Bernanke’s comments today
reinforced the notion of a global slowdown taking place.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January was unchanged at 10.97 percent.
