             Guntram Schneider, Labor Minister in
Germany’s largest state, North-Rhine Westphalia, aims to limit
shop hours until 10 p.m., as he said longer hours don’t create
new jobs,  Rheinische Post  reported today, citing an interview.  
 Schneider also wants to reduce working on Sundays, the
newspaper said in an e-mailed preview of a report to be
published today.
