             Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index higher for a second straight day, after Apple
Inc. reported better-than-estimated earnings and commodity
prices advanced. Japanese stocks fell as the yen strengthened.  
 Samsung Electronics Co. , which supplies semiconductor to
Apple, increased 2.4 percent in Seoul.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the
world’s No. 1 mining company, jumped 1.2 percent in Sydney as a
growth in U.S. building permits boosted copper prices. LG Chem
Ltd. rallied 4.4 percent in Seoul on record quarterly profit.
 Toyota Motor Corp. , which gets 67 percent of its revenue from
outside Japan, sank 0.8 percent as the yen’s gains dented the
outlook for export earnings.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.3 percent to 115.76 as
of 7:16 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has slumped 10 percent from
this year’s high on April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis and China’s
steps to curb property prices fueled concern that global
economic growth will slow. Speculation the U.S. economy will
contract intensified as reports pointed to a retreat in
manufacturing and home sales.  
 “We’ve been buying as the market has been oversold,” said
 Diane Lin , a Sydney-based fund manager at Pengana Capital Ltd.,
which oversees about $1 billion. “We’re still very cautious.
Overall U.S. economic growth will decelerate but there will be
pockets of growth, particularly in the technology sector as
reflected by Apple’s strong results.”  
 Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  advanced 1.1 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index increased 0.3 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi index climbed 0.7 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index added 0.2 percent.  
 Stronger Yen  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  dropped 0.2 percent,
erasing a 1.1 percent increase, as the yen snapped a two-day
loss against the euro and rose versus 15 of 16 major
counterparts. A stronger Japanese currency lowers the value of
overseas revenue that is repatriated.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.4
percent. The gauge climbed 1.1 percent yesterday on speculation
the Federal Reserve will take steps to spur lending and after a
government report showed building permits, a gauge of future
construction, rose 2.1 percent last month.  
 BHP Billiton, which today reported a 16 percent increased
in fourth-quarter iron-ore production, rose 1.2 percent to
A$38.75. Copper futures in London rose 0.3 percent, extending
yesterday’s 2 percent climb, after the report on U.S. building
permits bolstered prospects for metals demand.  
 Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
jumped 2 percent to A$67.80. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest
producer of the metal, rose 3 percent to HK$15.96 in Hong Kong.  
 Lower Valuations  
 “Sentiment has been improving after the better-than-
expected U.S. earnings eased investors’ concerns about a poor
economic outlook,” said  Michiya Tomita , a Hong Kong-based fund
manager for Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
$64 billion.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has declined 3.9 percent this
year, cutting the average price of stocks in the gauge to 14
times  estimated earnings , near the lowest level since December
2008. That compares with 13.2 times for the  S&P 500 Index  and
11.5 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 A measure of raw-material producers in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index advanced 1.4 percent today, the most of the
broader gauge’s 10 industry groups.  
 Samsung Electronics jumped 2.4 percent to 817,000 won.
Companies tied to Apple climbed after the U.S. company posted a
78 percent surge in  third-quarter profit  to $3.25 billion, or
$3.51 a share, as customers flocked to the new iPad tablet
computer and latest version of the iPhone. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast per-share profit of $3.11.  
 Catcher, LG Chem  
 Taiwan’s  Catcher Technology Co.  climbed 2.6 percent to
NT$78.5. Catcher supplies metal parts for the iPhone, according
to Yuanta Securities Co.  
 LG Chem, a maker of chemicals that also supplies iPhone
batteries, gained 4.4 percent to 335,500 won after quarterly
profit jumped to a record on Chinese demand for materials used
to make plastics and synthetic rubber.  
 In Hong Kong, builder New World Development Ltd. surged 3.5
percent to HK$13.58 after the stock was rated “overweight” in
new coverage at Morgan Stanley.  
 Among shares that declined,  Woolworths Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest retailer, dropped 1.8 percent to A$26.19 in Sydney after
reporting slowing fourth-quarter sales growth.  
 Japanese exporters dropped as the yen appreciated to 111.85
per euro from 112.70 in New York yesterday. It rose to 86.98 to
the dollar from 87.51, after advancing to 86.27 on July 16, the
strongest level since Dec. 1.  
 Toyota lost 0.8 percent to 3,030 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. ,
which gets a third of its revenue in North America, declined 1
percent to 607 yen.
