             Natural gas futures fell in New
York, erasing earlier gains, on concern U.S. supplies of the
power-plant and factory fuel are ample.  
 An Energy Department report tomorrow may show that gas
stockpiles gained 51 billion cubic feet in the week ended July
16, based on the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Inventories were 11 percent above the five-year
average the previous week, according to department data.  
 “The production base is still too high,” said  Scott Hanold , an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis.
“We are producing too much gas and demand is not strong
enough.”  
 Natural gas for August fell 7.7 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
settle at $4.513 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have declined 19 percent
this year.  
 The five-year average stockpile increase for last week is
64 billion cubic feet, department data showed.  
 Gas stockpiles gained 78 billion cubic feet in the week
ended July 9 to 2.84 trillion, the Energy Department said last
week. A surplus to the five-year average narrowed to 10.7
percent from 11.5 percent the previous week.  
 A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 1.1 percent
from 0.8 percent the previous week.  
 Stockpiles will reach 3.81 trillion cubic feet by the end
of October, the Energy Department said in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook report on July 7. Supplies rose to a record 3.837
trillion on Nov. 27.  
 Prices rose in earlier trading on forecasts for hotter-
than-normal weather.  
 July Forecast  
 Temperatures will be above normal from July 26 to July 30,
according to the  National Weather Service .  
 “The hot weather should help limit storage injections,”
said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Inc. in Houston. “Over the next few months, gas will take its
cue from the weather.”  
 New York will have a high of 96 degrees Fahrenheit (36
Celsius) on July 24, 11 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Boston is forecast to reach 90.  
 About 23 percent of electricity is generated using natural
gas, Energy Department figures show.  
 Cooling requirements in the U.S. will be 21 percent higher
than normal from tomorrow through July 28, according to Weather
Derivatives of Belton, Missouri.  
 Caribbean Weather  
 A system bringing heavy rain to the Dominican Republic,
Haiti and Puerto Rico is less likely to strengthen into a
depression or tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center
said.  
 The system has a 50 percent chance of developing into a
stronger storm within two days, the center  said  in an advisory
on its website at about 1:30 p.m., down from an estimated 70
percent probability earlier today.  
 This hurricane season, estimated by the government to be
the most active since 2005, may cut gas production in the Gulf
of Mexico by 166 billion cubic feet through November, according
to Energy Department estimates released on July 7.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 10.93 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $4.6994 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
247,048 as of 3:09 p.m., compared with a three-month average
total of 251,000. Volume was 251,450 yesterday. Open interest
was 785,515 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
829,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
