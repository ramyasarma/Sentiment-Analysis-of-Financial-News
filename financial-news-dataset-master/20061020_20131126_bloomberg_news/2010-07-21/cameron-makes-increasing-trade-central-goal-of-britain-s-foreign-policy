             Prime Minister  David Cameron  said he
wants increasing trade to be the central goal of British
diplomats and aid workers.  
 “I want to refashion British foreign policy, to make us
much more focused on the commercial aspects,” Cameron told
reporters travelling with him by train from Washington to New
York yesterday. “We’ve got to pay our way in the world.”  
 The emphasis on business marks a shift from the “ethical
foreign policy” promoted by the previous Labour government in
its early days. Other ministries may see their roles change,
with the  Department for International Development  asked to look
at how its aid projects will increase the capacity of recipients
to become trading partners.  
 International Development Secretary  Andrew Mitchell  said
today his department will pay for an airport on the South
Atlantic island of St. Helena, a British overseas territory,
with the goal of allowing it to become economically independent
of U.K. aid.  
 Defense Secretary  Liam Fox  told lawmakers yesterday he
wants to “support the defense industry by maximizing exports.”  
 The government is also considering opening up senior jobs,
including ambassadorial posts, to people from business
backgrounds, according to a person familiar with the
discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity.  
 ‘Winning Orders’  
 Simon Fraser , the top civil servant at the Department for
Business, will move to the equivalent position at the Foreign
Office. Cameron said he recently flew all Britain’s ambassadors
back to London to tell them their job was “winning orders for
Britain.”  
 In New York, the prime minister met senior figures in the
finance industry, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO  Lloyd Blankfein , to “talk about the importance of keeping Britain’s
strength in terms of financial services.”  
 Next week Cameron flies to India with what he called “an
enormous crew of business leaders and chief executives” to
promote trade links with the country.
