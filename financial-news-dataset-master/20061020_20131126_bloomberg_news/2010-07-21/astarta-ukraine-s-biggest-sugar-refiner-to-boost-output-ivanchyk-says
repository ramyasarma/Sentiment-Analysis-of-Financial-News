             Astarta Holding NV , Ukraine’s
biggest producer of refined sugar, plans to increase output 42
percent after prices doubled last year, Chief Executive Officer
 Viktor Ivanchyk  said.  
 Astarta may increase output to 320,000 metric tons after
plantings of sugar beet climbed to 40,000 hectares (98,800
acres) from 35,000 hectareslast year, Ivanchyk said in an
interview in Kiev. Sugar prices doubled in 2009 after bad
weather curbed crops in Brazil and India, the largest producers.  
 Domestic prices are “at a fair level” and allow profits
from growing sugar beet and refining raw sugar, Ivanchyk said in
the interview last month. “We are very satisfied with the
condition of our sugar beet.”  
 Ukraine wants farmers to plant more sugar beet after annual
sugar output shrank to 1.267 million tons last year from an
average 5 million tons in the 1990s as farmers sowed less of the
plant. This year, the Agriculture Ministry forecast the
sugar beet harvest will be 17 million tons, up 70 percent from
last year. The government expects refined sugar output to be as
much as 2.2 million tons in the marketing year starting Sept. 1,
Agriculture Minister  Mykola Prysyazhnyuk  said yesterday.  
 “It has been good rains in May and June,” Ivanchyk said.
“The plants are in no danger of dry weather.”  
 Sugar Imports  
 Ukraine’s production last year fell short of domestic
demand of about 1.8 million tons, according to Economy Ministry
estimates. At the beginning of April, imports of refined sugar
in the current marketing year came to 257,233 tons, according to
the Economy Ministry.  
 “Ukraine can sharply increase sugar output to 3 million
tons a year within five years and easily become a sugar
exporter,” Ivanchyk said. Astarta wants to be able to export
sugar to Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and possibly the European
Union, he said.  
 After joining the World Trade Organization in 2008,
Ukraine agreed to allow up to 260,000 tons of sugar imports at a
duty of 2 percent, with shipments above that level carrying a
duty of 50 percent.  
 Growing sugar beet in Ukraine was  unprofitable  in three of
the last seven years after bumper crops kept domestic prices
low, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign
Agricultural Service.  
 In 2006, farmers gathered 22.4 million tons of sugar beet,
the biggest harvest since 1996, according to Ukraine’s state
statistics office.  
 Astarta, which is listed in Warsaw, operates five sugar
refineries and processing capacity has increased to 27,000 tons
of sugar beet a day from 20,000 tons a day last year, Ivanchyk
said. The shares have climbed 48 percent this year.
