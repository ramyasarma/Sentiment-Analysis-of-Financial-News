             The  Botswana Stock Exchange  plans to
introduce automated trading by the end of the year to improve
volumes and liquidity, and to attract foreign listings.  
 The trading system is in the last stage of technical
evaluation and may be introduced during the fourth quarter, said
Thapelo Tsheole, product development manager at the exchange.  
 “Automating the BSE will help bring the market closer to
the people,” making it easier for both local and foreign
investors to trade on the exchange, he said in an interview
today in the capital,  Gaborone .  
 Automation will also “improve efficiency and make trading
possible throughout the day.” Trading on the BSE currently
takes place once a day at an agreed time, Tsheole said.  
 The BSE opened in 1989 and currently has 33 companies
listed on it. Three listings have taken place so far this year,
including a new instrument,  Absa Group Ltd.’s  NewGold exchange-
traded fund.  
 South Africa and Egypt are the only two other African
nations that trade ETFs, according to Absa. NewGold is South
Africa’s largest ETF and the world’s third-biggest gold ETF.  
 “The idea is to increase liquidity” on the BSE, said
Tsheole. “We think this will provide a basis for the  BSE  to
attract foreign listings.”
