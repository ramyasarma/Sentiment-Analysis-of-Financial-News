             Fiat SpA , Italy’s biggest carmaker,
said it will get as much as 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of
loans to finance a spinoff of its industrial businesses.  
 Fiat said today its board of directors approved the
demerger of its truck and heavy equipment operations from its
car unit into a new company called Fiat Industrial SpA. The
automaker said it earned 90 million euros in the second quarter,
compared with a 168 million-euro loss a year earlier.  
 The loans, expected to be concluded before the demerger on
Jan. 1, will help repay intercompany financing to Fiat
Industrial, the Turin-based company said in a statement.  
 Barclays Capital Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole
CIB, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Societe Generale SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Citigroup Inc. and UniCredit SpA will
provide the financing, which will include a revolving credit
facility and a term loan, Fiat said.  
 Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s
been repaid; in a term loan it can’t.
