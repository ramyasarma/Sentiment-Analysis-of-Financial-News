             Canadian wholesale  sales 
unexpectedly fell for a second month in May as farmers in the
country’s western prairie provinces stopped buying supplies
because of bad weather.  
 Overall sales fell 0.1 percent to C$44.1 billion ($42.5
billion), with agricultural supplies dropping 30 percent,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists expected a
0.3 percent increase in total sales, based on the median of 13
responses in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Poor weather in Western Canada resulted in lower farm
demand for fertilizer and seeds,” Statistics Canada’s report
said. Sales in Saskatchewan, a major wheat producer, fell 12
percent, the most since March 2005.  
 Farmers planted less wheat than a year ago because of wet
weather, according to a June 23 Statistics Canada survey, which
added that the next report due in August may show flooding
caused further reductions.  
 The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.0373 per
U.S. dollar at 8:32 a.m. in Toronto from 1.0436 late yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys 96.40 U.S. cents.  
 The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the effect of
price changes, fell 1.5 percent, in part because the Canadian
dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar and boosted the cost of
imported goods, Statistics Canada said.  
 Offsets Gains  
 The decline in farm supplies offset gains in six of the
seven subcategories. Sales of machinery and equipment rose 1.9
percent, while food, beverage and tobacco sales gained 1.3
percent. Motor vehicle and parts sales gained 0.6 percent.  
 Overall wholesale sales were 9.5 percent higher in May than
the same month a year earlier, the agency said.  
 The Bank of Canada yesterday raised its  key lending rate 
for a second month, and the International Monetary Fund says the
country’s growth will lead the Group of Seven this year.  
 Wholesale inventories rose 1.7 percent to C$52.4 billion in
May, the biggest gain since January 2007.  
 Statistics Canada today also reduced its estimate of
April’s sales decline to 0.2 percent from the originally
reported 0.3 percent.
