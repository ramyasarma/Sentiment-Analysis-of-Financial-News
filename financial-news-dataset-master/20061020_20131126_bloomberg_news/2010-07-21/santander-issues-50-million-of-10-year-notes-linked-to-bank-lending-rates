             Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest
lender, sold $50 million of 10-year notes that pay interest
depending on how many days interbank lending rates stay within a
pre-defined range.  
 In the first five years, the so-called range accrual notes
pay an annual coupon of as much as 2.15 percentage points over
the three-month London interbank offered rate, according to the
term sheet. Interest accrues each day the benchmark stays in a
range of zero percent to 7 percent.  
 In the remaining five years, the notes pay a coupon of
eight times the difference between the 10-year dollar swap rate
and the two-year rate. The swap rate is the cost to exchange
fixed interest payments for floating ones, and vice versa.  
 The 10-year swap contract is 2.94 percent and the two-year
swap is 0.79 percent. The coupon has a zero percent floor so if
short-term rates rise above longer-dated ones, or invert,
investors won’t incur a loss on their principle.  
 The notes, issued at par by Santander International Debt
SA, are callable at quarterly intervals after five years. Morgan
Stanley is the selling agent.  
 Three-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks
and used as a borrowing benchmark, was 0.5125 percent yesterday.
The rate was last above 7 percent in January 1991.
