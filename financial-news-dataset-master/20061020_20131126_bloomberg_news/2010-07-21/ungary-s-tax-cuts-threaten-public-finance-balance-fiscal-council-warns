             The Hungarian government’s plan to
cut taxes may hurt the country’s primary budget balance from
2011 because there are no measures to offset the decline in
revenue, the  Fiscal Council  said.  
 The primary budget balance, which strips out debt service
costs, may worsen by more than 200 billion forint ($897 million)
in 2011 and 2012, the council said in an e-mailed statement
today. Extending a planned bank tax wouldn’t make up for the
shortfall because it would also affect revenue from corporate
income taxes, according to the council, which oversees budget
planning and execution.  
 The International Monetary Fund and the European Union
ended talks with Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government on
July 17 without endorsing his plans for controlling the budget
deficit. Hungary earlier pledged to narrow its shortfall to less
than 3 percent of gross domestic product next year. Orban’s
administration wants the tax cuts to jumpstart economic growth.  
 “In 2011, the proposal doesn’t comply with the rule” of
balancing measures that swell the deficit with revenue flows,
the Council said in its statement. “The planned amendments
wouldn’t comply with the principle of mandatory offsetting even
if -- according to the government’s plans -- it would be
possible to include the 200 billion forint from the special
financial services tax.”  
 The forint, the world’s worst-performing currency in the
past three months with an 8 percent decline against the euro,
traded at 286.80 per euro at 11:25 a.m. in Budapest from 286.54
late yesterday.
