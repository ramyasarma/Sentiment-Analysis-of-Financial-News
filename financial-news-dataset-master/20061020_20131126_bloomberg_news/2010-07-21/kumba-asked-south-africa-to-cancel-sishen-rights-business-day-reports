             Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. in March asked
South African Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu not to
grant prospecting rights for the Sishen mine in the Northern
Cape to Imperial Crown Trading because of mining-law
contraventions, Business Day reported.  
 Kumba, a unit of Anglo American Plc, said regulations in
South Africa’s Mining Act were ignored and that Imperial’s
application contained information from the file of Kumba unit
Sishen Iron Ore Co., which also applied for the rights, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported, citing a letter by Kumba
Chied Executive Officer Chris Griffith.
