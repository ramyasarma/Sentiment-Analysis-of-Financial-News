             Howard Lutnick , chairman of Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, said that its U.K. carbon credits brokerage was a
money-losing failure, with business projections based on dreams.  
 Cantor is suing Stephen Drummond, a former executive at the
brokerage, in London for the return of $2 million it says it
lent him while he was running the unit,  CantorCO2e . Drummond is
countersuing, claiming he was wrongfully dismissed in 2009 for
failing to tell the company he was in talks with a competitor
about a job.  
 Lutnick said on the witness stand today that since Drummond
left, Cantor has been trying to turn Drummond’s operation into
revenue.  
 “We can’t figure out how to make money from it,” he said.
“The pipeline that Mr. Drummond talked about was a dream. None
of Mr. Drummond’s projections came true.” The business was
built on a “giant series of ifs,” he said.  
 CantorCO2e this year closed its London desk and shifted its
business to the U.S., where it is hiring additional workers, as
brokers lost share in the market for carbon permits and credits
to the European Climate Exchange in London, the biggest bourse
for emissions trading.  
 CantorCO2e and EcoSecurities, the competitor Drummond was
in discussions with, both manage projects that receive Certified
Emission Reduction credits under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.  bought EcoSecurities last year for about
$200 million. Drummond and  Carlton Bartels  formed CO2e.com in
2000 and merged it with Cantor’s environmental brokerage in
2007, according to a  company website .  
 $2 Million Loan  
 Earlier this week Cantor lawyer Paul Nicholls said that the
firm lent Drummond, the most senior employee at CantorCO2e,
$2 million to help him buy a home in Oxford, England. The 2008
loan agreement said Cantor wouldn’t ask for the money back if
Drummond gave up equity in the company and agreed to stay at
CantorCO2e for five years, Nicholls said in court papers.  
 Cantor fired him a few months after providing the loan when
it discovered he had been meeting with EcoSecurities. Drummond
claims he was wrongfully dismissed, and says he doesn’t owe the
company money, because the $2 million was paid to him in
exchange for his shares when Cantor bought the business.  
 Lutnick said today he regarded the money as a payment to
ensure that Drummond would stay with CantorCO2e.  
 “If he just stayed loyal to the company, and stayed with
the company he would net $2 million,” Lutnick said. “But I
knew and he knew that his equity wasn’t worth $2 million.”  
 Cantor would give Drummond back his equity in the business
“right now” if he paid back the $2 million, Lutnick testified.  
 The cases are: Cantor Fitzgerald LP v. Stephen Drummond and
Stephen Drummond v. CantorCO2e Limited.
