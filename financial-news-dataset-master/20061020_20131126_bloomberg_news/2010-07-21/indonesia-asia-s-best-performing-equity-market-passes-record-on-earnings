             Indonesian  stocks  rose to a record,
paced by  PT Gudang Garam  and  PT International Nickel Indonesia ,
on speculation corporate earnings and higher commodity prices
will extend the biggest rally among Asian equity markets.  
 Gudang Garam increased 3.7 percent on speculation benign
inflation will boost sales by the nation’s second-biggest
cigarette maker.  PT International Nickel Indonesia  climbed 2.7
percent after nickel futures advanced for the first time in
three days, improving the revenue outlook at the metal producer.  
 “Most people expect the earnings to come out positive,”
said Finny Fauzana, who helps manage about $102 million at PT
PNM Investment Management in Jakarta. “Consumer companies will
probably do well simply by looking at how good our economy has
performed so far.”  
 The  Jakarta Composite index  gained 0.6 percent to close at
3,013.40, the highest on record. The measure has risen 19
percent this year, the most among Asia’s 10 largest markets.
Shares climbed as record-low interest rates and faster economic
growth bolstered profits. President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ’s
reelection in July 2009 raised confidence the country will keep
policies that helped it avoid last year’s global recession.  
 Gudang Garam advanced 3.7 percent to 35,300 rupiah. The
company increased first-quarter profit by 19 percent and may
announce earnings for the April-June period on July 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PT United Tractors ,
Indonesia’s biggest heavy equipment seller, climbed 1 percent to
19,700 rupiah after it said today first-half sales almost
doubled from a year earlier to 2,700 units.  
 Publicly listed companies have until the end of this month
to report their unaudited second-quarter earnings.  
 The Indonesian central bank on July 5 kept its benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 6.5 percent for an 11th month.
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy may expand 5.6 percent this
year compared with 4.5 percent last year, the central bank said
on March 8, citing rising consumer spending. Consumption
accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.  
 International Nickel, Indonesia’s biggest producer of the
metal, advanced 2.7 percent to 3,875 rupiah as nickel futures
gained 1.7 percent to $19,125 a metric ton in London yesterday.
 PT Aneka Tambang , the nation’s second-largest, rose 2.8 percent
to 2,025 rupiah.
