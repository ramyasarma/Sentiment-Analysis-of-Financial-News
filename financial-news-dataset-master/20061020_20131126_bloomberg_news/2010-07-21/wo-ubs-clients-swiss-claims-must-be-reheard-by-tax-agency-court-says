             Switzerland’s  Federal Administrative
Court  lifted an order by tax authorities authorizing the
transfer of  UBS AG  bank data to the U.S. regarding two of the
bank’s clients.  
 Swiss tax authorities failed to hear the two plaintiffs
before issuing the order, the court said in a July 15 ruling
that was published today. The court sent the matter back to the
 tax office  that must give the plaintiffs an opportunity to
comment and then issue a new decision, according to the ruling.  
 In a pilot case earlier this week, the court said that an
agreement with the U.S. to transfer data on as many as 4,450 UBS
accounts is binding and rejected a bid to block sending account
information.  
 Last month the Swiss parliament approved the 2009 agreement
with the U.S., elevating it to the status of an official state
treaty. That treaty will also govern the tax office’s decision
in today’s case.  
 After realizing its mistake, the tax office tried to revoke
the order. The tax agency will now review today’s case and any
decision will be guided by the pilot case ruling, said Roger
Braunschweig, a tax administration official.  
 UBS spokesman  Dominique Gerster  declined to comment. The
bank clients weren’t indentified.  
 Today’s case is: A-3786/2010.
