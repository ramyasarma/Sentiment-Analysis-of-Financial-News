             Woolworths Holdings Ltd. , a South
African food and clothing retailer, said fiscal full-year
earnings per share will be in line with last year, when profit
was boosted by the sale of its financial services business.  
 Per-share earnings, excluding one-time items and goodwill
amortization, surged between 45 percent and 55 percent in the 52
weeks through June 27, the Cape Town-based company said in a
stock-exchange statement today.  
 Woolworths in fiscal 2009 made a 380 million-rand ($50.3
million) profit selling a majority stake in its financial
services division to  Absa Group Ltd. , South Africa’s biggest
retail bank. This year, increased clothing sales and lower tax
charges helped the improvement in profit before one-time items,
the retailer said.  
 The  shares  rose as much as 60 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
25.50 rand in Johannesburg and were trading at 25.08 rand at
10.06 a.m. local time. The stock has jumped 43 percent in the
past six months, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in the
benchmark  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share  index.  
 Sales at stores opened for at least a year rose 5.7 percent
in the period, with clothing and general merchandise sales
increasing 6.7 percent, the company said. A detailed earnings
report will be released on Aug. 26, Woolworths said.  
 The retailer is not related to London-based Woolworths
Group Plc or Woolworths Ltd., located in Sydney.
