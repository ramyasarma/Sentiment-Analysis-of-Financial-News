             BioVerde Industria e Comercio de
Biocombustiveis SA  agreed to pay 23.5 million reais ($13.2
million) for assets of  Companhia Petroquimica do Nordeste , known
as Copenor, according to a regulatory filing.  
 The buy is part of BioVerde’s plan to boost its biodiesel
production capacity to fourteen times its current amount by the
end of next year before going public in 2013, board member and
head of capital markets at Trendbank,  Ailton Domingues , said in
a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  
 Taubate-based BioVerde will invest a further 55 million
reais in a 200,000 square-meter (2.2 million square-feet)
industrial plant by the end of the year. The company aims to
reach an annual production capacity of 1.2 billion liters by
June, 2012.  
 The company currently has the capacity to produce up to 83
million liters of biodiesel annually at its sole unit in
Taubate, according to its Website.  
 “With this investment, we are completing the business plan
to become the main biodiesel producer in the country after
 Petrobras ,” Domingues said. BioVerde plans to go public in
2013, and will fund its investments until 2012 with its own
resources, credit lines and selling debt, he said.
