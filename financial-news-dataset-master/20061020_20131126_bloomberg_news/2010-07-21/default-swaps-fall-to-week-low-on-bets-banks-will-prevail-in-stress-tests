             The cost of insuring against losses
on European financial bonds fell to the lowest in one week on
speculation that stress tests will reassure investors that banks
can withstand a crisis.  
 The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on 25 of the region’s banks and insurers dropped 5 basis points
to 135.5, JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices show. The contracts are
down from a 15-month high of 200 basis points June 8.  
 Banks will publish their estimated Tier 1 capital ratios
under three different scenarios, according to regulator
documents obtained by Bloomberg News. The Committee of
European Banking Supervisors is using the tests this week to
bolster confidence after a sovereign deficit crisis triggered a
sell-off in the financial sector.  
 “People perceive there’s some progress to be made from
stress tests in terms of transparency and capitalization,” said
 Aziz Sunderji , a London-based credit strategist at Barclays
Capital in London. “Most of the price action for European
credit is around stress testing.”  
 Under one of the events tested, lenders will publish how
much they will need to raise if Tier 1 capital, used to cushion
losses, falls below 6 percent in a “sovereign shock,” the
draft shows.  
 Credit markets were also buoyed by better-than estimated
earnings from Apple Inc. to Fiat SpA and Accor SA.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 investment-
grade companies declined 3.25 basis points to 116.25 and the
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 9.5 basis points to
524, according to JPMorgan.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.
