             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  doubled its
lobbying expenses as it focused on proposed financial
regulations and faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it misled investors.  
 New York-based  Goldman , which paid $550 million last week
to settle the SEC suit, spent $2.7 million to lobby during the
first six months of 2010, more than double the $1.3 million it
spent during the same period a year earlier, according to new
congressional filings.  
 Several other financial institutions also increased their
lobbying this year before congressional approval of the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
measure was signed into law today by President  Barack Obama .  
 Among the top 10 U.S. banks ranked by assets, six reported
increases in lobbying spending between January and June compared
with the same period in 2009.  
 Bank of America Corp.  spent $2 million, up 33 percent from
$1.5 million spent during the first six months of 2009.  Wells
Fargo & Co. ’s spending rose to $2.3 million from $1.4 million in
2009.  Morgan Stanley  spent $1.6 million, compared with $1.4
million a year earlier, though its second-quarter lobbying
expenses were lower than a year ago.  
 The banks’ trade group, the Washington-based  American
Bankers Association , spent $4.2 million, up from $3.9 million.  
 “The increase in our lobbying expenses reflects the
additional analysis and legal support devoted to regulatory
reform and related legislation as it evolved over the last
several months,” said  Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the largest
U.S. bank by assets.  
 Higher Costs  
 Mary Eshet , a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the higher lobbying costs reflected the company’s
growth following its acquisition of Wachovia Corp.  
 “It’s important to stay in tune with the conversations and
decisions that occur in Washington, D.C., because so many of
them impact our four most important stakeholders: our customers,
our shareholders, our team members and our communities,” she
said.  
 Melissa Daly , a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and  Mark Lake , a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment.  
 As the banks’ lobbying expenses grew, their contributions
to lawmakers decreased. Bank of America’s political action
committee made $496,500 in donations between Jan. 1, 2009, and
June 30, 2010, down from $716,822 during the same 18-month
period in 2007-08. Morgan Stanley’s PAC gave $303,500, down from
$663,300 two years ago. New York-based Citigroup Inc.’s PAC
contributions fell to $499,000 from $756,600.  
 Legislation Passed  
 Lawmakers reluctant to take money from banks blamed for
causing the economic meltdown don’t have to worry about it now
that Obama has signed the financial regulation bill into law,
said  Rogan Kersh , associate dean at New York University’s Wagner
School of Public Service.  
 “Once the bill has passed, it’s much harder for their
opponents or good-government advocates to claim that their vote
was unduly influenced by campaign cash,” Kersh said.
