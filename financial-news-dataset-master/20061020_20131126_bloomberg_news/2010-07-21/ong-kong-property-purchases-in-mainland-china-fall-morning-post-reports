             Hong Kong purchases of homes on the
mainland fell 28 percent in the first half to between 7,900 to
8,900 as Chinese government restrictions damped demand, the
South China Morning Post reported, citing figures from
consultant Land Power International.  
 The Chinese government has restricted loans to real-estate
developers and imposed higher interest rates and down payments
for second mortgages to cool surging property prices that rose
by records in some cities in the second quarter.
