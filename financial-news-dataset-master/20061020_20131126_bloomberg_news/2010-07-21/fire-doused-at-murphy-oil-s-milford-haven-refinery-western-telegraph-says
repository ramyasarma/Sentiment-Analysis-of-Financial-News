             A fire was extinguished overnight at
Murphy Oil Corp.’s Milford Haven oil refinery in Wales, the
Western Telegraph reported on its website, citing the local
police.  
 The blaze broke out in a processing unit at 18 minutes
after midnight, according to the report. The fire was put out a
“short time” later, the report said. The specific unit wasn’t
identified.  
 The 108,000-barrel-a-day site was shut down for maintenance
earlier this year. Work scheduled to be done then was planned to
expand daily oil-processing capacity to about 130,000 barrels.
