             The euro may fall as low as $1.2750
as trading thins before the publication of European bank stress
test results this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc said.  
 “Commitment is unlikely to overwhelm as volumes recede
ahead of Friday’s stress test results,”  Kenneth Broux , a senior
market economist at Lloyds in London, wrote in a note today.
“We are not huge fans of euro-dollar rally over $1.30 and
target a return to the area around $1.2750.”  
 The euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.2854
as of 10:04 a.m. in London, down from the two-month high of
$1.3029 yesterday.
