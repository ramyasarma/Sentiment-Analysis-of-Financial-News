             Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gold mining company, said fourth-quarter production
climbed 32 percent, boosted by record output at mines in
Australia and Indonesia and a new operation in Papua New Guinea.  
 Output was 526,131 ounces in the three months ended June 30,
compared with 397,826 ounces a year ago, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. Copper production dropped 12
percent to 20,827 metric tons.  
 Newcrest is in the process of buying Port Moresby, Papua
New Guinea-based  Lihir Gold Ltd ., the No. 2 producer traded on
the Australian stock exchange, to create the world’s fifth-
biggest gold company. The first court hearing in Papua New
Guinea to approve the merger is scheduled for today. Gold for
immediate delivery averaged about $1,197 during the quarter,
compared with about $924 the year before.  
 Newcrest climbed 0.8 percent to A$33.57 at 10:32 a.m. in
Sydney, compared with a 0.2 percent drop in the benchmark index.  
 Full-year gold output increased 8 percent to 1.76 million
ounces, with record quarterly production at its Telfer mine in
Australia and the Gosowong mine in Indonesia. The result was in
line with UBS AG’s forecast of 1.75 million ounces.  
 The Hidden Valley mine in Papua New Guinea produced 18,785
ounces of gold in the quarter compared with 17,680 ounces the
quarter before, the company said.  
 Full-year production may be at the lower end of its 1.81
million to 1.91 million ounce forecast, Newcrest said in April.
