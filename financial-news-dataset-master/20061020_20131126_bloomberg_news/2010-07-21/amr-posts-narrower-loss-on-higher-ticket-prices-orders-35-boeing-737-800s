             American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. 
posted a narrower second-quarter loss on higher fares and said
it will buy 35  Boeing Co.  737-800 jets to replace its less fuel-
efficient MD-80s.  
 The second-largest U.S. carrier also promoted  Tom Horton  to
president, and said  Bella Goren  will replace him as chief
financial officer, according to a statement today. The changes
were announced as the Fort Worth, Texas-based company reported a
loss of $10.7 million, or 3 cents a share, larger than the 1-
cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed.  
 American  may be the only major U.S. airline to report a
loss this quarter, based on analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. While fares and traffic rose, the carrier’s fuel
costs also climbed 24 percent to $1.66 billion, making it AMR’s
second-largest expense behind wages and benefits.  
 “Though increased fuel prices added dramatically to our
expenses this quarter, we made substantial progress improving
our financial performance,” Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Gerard Arpey , 51, said in the statement.  
 Arpey is giving up the title of president to Horton, 49,
who initially joined the airline’s finance unit in 1985. Horton
left for about four years starting in 2002 to serve as finance
chief and vice chairman of what is now  AT&T Inc.,  then came back
to the airline in 2006.  
 AMR’s revenue in the quarter rose 16 percent to $5.7
billion as the carrier flew more passengers at higher fares. The
loss a year earlier was $390 million, or $1.39 a share.  
 AMR fell 23 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $6.62 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  have
fallen 14 percent this year.  
 New Jets  
 AMR said it would begin taking delivery of the new 737-800s
in 2011 and 2012. The planes would cost about $2.5 billion
before discounts, based on starting  list prices  of about $72.5
million each on Boeing’s website.  
 The jets are in addition to the 84 new 737s that American
began adding in 2009 as it retires its MD-80 narrow-body fleet,
which had an average age of 19 years and made up about 40
percent of AMR’s fleet as of the end of 2009.  
 The twin-engine MD-80s, which Boeing stopped making in
1999, carry about 140 passengers while the 737-800s seat 150
each. The newer planes burn about 800,000 fewer gallons of fuel
a year than the MD-80s, American said.  
 With the new order, American will have 195 of the 737-800s
in its narrow-body fleet by the end of 2012.  
 US Airways, AirTran  
 US Airways Group Inc.  today reported second-quarter profit
excluding some items of $265 million, or $1.34 a share,
exceeding the $1.18 average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 19 percent to $3.17 billion, which beat
the $3.15 billion estimate by analysts.  
 The Tempe, Arizona-based airline said it expects to be
profitable this quarter and for the full year, and that it will
recall 300 pilots and flight attendants as travel demand
continues to rise.  
 US Airways said that including one-time items for a refund
of security fees and corporate transaction costs, net income
rose almost fivefold to $279 million, or $1.41 a share, from $58
million, or 42 cents, a year earlier.  
 AirTran Holdings Inc.,  a discount carrier that flies mostly
in the eastern U.S., said today that second-quarter profit
excluding the effect of fuel hedges was $38.8 million, or 23
cents a share. That trailed the 25-cent average of 14 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Net income fell to $12.4 million, or 9 cents, from $78.4
million, or 56 cents, a year earlier.  
 Revenue rose 16 percent to $700.6 million, less than the
$706.9 million average analyst estimate. The Orlando, Florida-
based carrier said its planes were more than 83 percent full in
the quarter, a record.
