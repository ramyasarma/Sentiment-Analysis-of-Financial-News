             Gold may gain for a second day in
New York on speculation the metal’s price decline will boost
physical demand and as investors buy commodities.  
 Bullion rebounded yesterday after earlier dropping to an
eight-week low of $1,175.10 an ounce, while holdings in the
world’s biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund fell 6.08
metric tons. The metal is trading 5.6 percent below a record
$1,266.50 set June 21. European equities gained and the dollar
rose against the euro before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks today on the economy.  
 “There’s been an upturn in physical buying, in Asia
particularly,” said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered
Plc in London. “People see it is a cheap price. There’s been a
bit of an improvement in risk appetite and gold can benefit on
the back of portfolio flows.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery added $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,195.50 an ounce at 8:03 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices earlier fell as much as 0.3 percent. Gold for
immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent higher at
$1,195.88.  
 Bullion rose to $1,191.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,183 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 “There’s more money available for commodities,” Smith
said. All six industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange
rose today, led by copper. Crude-oil futures gained in New York.  
 Gold climbed with the dollar in the previous three quarters
as the euro slumped 16 percent in the period against the
greenback. The U.S. currency yesterday fell to the lowest level
since May 10 against the euro.  
 Stress Tests  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-debt holdings. Results will be released July 23. Fed
Chairman Bernanke  delivers his semiannual report on monetary
policy to the Senate Banking Committee today, and testifies to
the House Financial Services Committee tomorrow.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETF backed by
bullion, fell to 1,308.13 tons yesterday, according to the
company’s website. Global holdings of the metal by ETFs dropped
6.08 tons from a record to 2,071.97 tons yesterday, according to
 Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 “There has been a quiet, but steady net decline over the
course of the past three weeks” in ETF holdings, said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-
based Gartman Letter. “It takes buying and lots of it to put
any market up; it takes a mere lack of buying to put the same
market down.”  
 Silver for September delivery in New York rose 0.8 percent
to $17.835 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery gained 0.5
percent to $1,525 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery was
little changed at $451.10 an ounce.
