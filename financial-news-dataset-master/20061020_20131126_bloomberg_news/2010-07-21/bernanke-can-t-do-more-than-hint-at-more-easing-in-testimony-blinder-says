             Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  probably won’t outline new policies today beyond those
disclosed in minutes of the Fed’s June meeting, including a
possible hint at more easing if necessary, former Fed Vice
Chairman  Alan Blinder  said.  
 “Speaking for the whole committee, he can’t really strike
out very far beyond what was in the minutes and he already
said,” Blinder, a Princeton University economist, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop With  Betty Liu .”  
 Bernanke plans today to deliver his semiannual report on
monetary policy in testimony to Congress. The Fed signaled last
month that Europe’s debt crisis may harm U.S. growth and
repeated a pledge to keep interest rates near zero “for an
extended period.”  
 “They have given the slightest, slightest hint they are
thinking about doing more quantitative easing if necessary,”
Blinder said. “I don’t see that he can go much beyond those
parameters.”  
 Blinder also said Congress should allocate more spending to
stimulate the economy in the short term, while outlining a
credible deficit-reduction plan over time.  
 The Senate is preparing to approve a $34 billion bill that
extends unemployment aid to millions of Americans. The Senate
voted 60-40 yesterday to end a filibuster by Republicans who
objected that the bill would add to the federal deficit. The
chamber will take a final vote as soon as today.
