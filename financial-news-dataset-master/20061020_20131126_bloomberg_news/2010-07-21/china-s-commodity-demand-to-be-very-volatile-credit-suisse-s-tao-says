             Commodity demand from China, the
world’s biggest metals consumer, will be “very volatile” as
the nation’s economy slows, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  
 “Chinese demand over the next 12 to 18 months is not going
to be as bullish as many people believe,”  Dong Tao , chief
economist for Asia excluding Japan at Credit Suisse, said today
at a briefing in Melbourne.  
 Economic expansion in China is cooling after the government
tempered credit growth and investment spending and cracked down
on real-estate speculation. Gross domestic product expanded 10.3
percent in the second quarter, down from 11.9 percent in the
first, the government reported last week.  
 Growth on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis will be
6.7 percent by the end of the year, Tao said.  
 There’s a “drastic inventory correction” in the steel
sector because of a moderation in spending on infrastructure,
he said.
