             Gold rose in New York for a second
straight day on speculation that a global economic recovery will
boost demand for raw materials.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities advanced
as much as 0.8 percent, led by a 3 percent gain in copper as
equities rallied in Europe and Asia. Gold is still down 5.9
percent from a record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 “If you see a sooner-than-expected pick-up in economic
activity, then you’re going to see gold rally along with silver
and copper,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose 10 cents to $1,191.80
an ounce on the Comex in New York. The metal has gained 8.7
percent this year.  
 The  MSCI World Index  of equities rose as much as 0.7
percent. The gauge had three consecutive monthly losses.  
 Still, gold’s gains were limited as some investors sold the
metal on dwindling demand for a haven asset. Last month, gold
also reached a record in euros, sterling and Swiss francs amid
Europe’s credit crisis.  
 ‘Struggling’ to Rise  
 “Gold is struggling to go higher,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The currency
markets have stabilized, so we’re not seeing that flight out of
currencies into gold. Investors have more appetite for risk than
fear.”  
 The metal fell as much as 0.3 percent before rebounding.  
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, dropped 0.5 percent yesterday to
1,308.13 metric tons, the biggest decline since early February.  
 “Traders are currently focusing on tracking risk appetite
and keeping an eye on slowing investment flows into gold as the
euro-centric crisis appears to be dissipating,” said  Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  
 Precious metals with wider industrial applications rose on
speculation that demand for raw materials will increase as the
global economy recovers.  
 Silver futures for September gained 11 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $17.803 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $12, or 0.8
percent, to $1,529.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $1.10, or
0.2 percent, to $452.15 an ounce, also on Nymex.
