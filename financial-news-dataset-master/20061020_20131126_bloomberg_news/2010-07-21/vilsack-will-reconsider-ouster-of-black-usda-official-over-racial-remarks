             Agriculture Secretary  Tom Vilsack 
said today that he will reconsider the ouster of a black USDA
official in Georgia over comments she made that she didn’t use
the “full force” of what she could do to help a white farmer.  
 “I am of course willing and will conduct a thorough review
and consider additional facts to ensure to the American people
we are providing services in a fair and equitable manner,”
Vilsack said in a written statement.  
 Vilsack asked for  Shirley Sherrod ’s resignation after a
clip from a video surfaced showing her comments, made as part of
a speech she gave in March at an NAACP banquet in Georgia. The
video was highlighted by the Web site biggovernment.com and
posted on YouTube.  
 “There is zero tolerance for discrimination at USDA and we
strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person,”
Vilsack had said in a statement. “We have been working to turn
the page on the sordid civil rights record at USDA, and this
controversy could make it more difficult to move forward on
correcting injustices.”  
 Sherrod said today on NBC’s “Today” show that she wasn’t
sure whether she would return to USDA were she offered a job.  
 “No one would listen” at the department when she tried to
explain the context of her remarks, she said. “I am just not
sure of how I would be treated there now.”  
 NAACP ‘Snookered’  
 The  NAACP , the nation’s oldest civil rights organization,
originally condemned her remarks as the release of the video
clip coincided with their call to leaders of the Tea Party
movement to “repudiate those in their ranks who use racist
language in their signs and speeches.”  
 However, after viewing the full video and speaking to
Sherrod and the white farmers she mentioned in her remarks,
NAACP President and Chief Executive Officer  Benjamin Todd Jealous  said in a  statement  that he believes the organization
was “snookered” by those who circulated the edited clip.  
 “The fact is Ms. Sherrod did help the white farmers
mentioned in her speech,” Jealous said. “They personally
credit her with helping to save their family farm.”  
 Jealous said Sherrod was “sharing this account as part of
a story of transformation and redemption.”  
 According to Jealous, in the unedited video, Sherrod said
the dislocation of farmers is about “haves and have nots.”  
 “It’s not just about black people, it’s about poor
people,” Sherrod said in the rest of her remarks, according to
the statement.
