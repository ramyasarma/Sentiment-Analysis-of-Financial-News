             A former broker at Merrill Lynch &
Co. and Citigroup Inc. convicted of selling access to his
brokerages’ internal “squawk boxes” lost a bid to have a judge
throw out his conviction and those of others because prosecutors
hid evidence of their innocence.  
 Kenneth Mahaffy Jr. and five co-defendants found guilty
last year asked U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to cancel their
convictions, throw out the indictment or grant them a new trial.
Gleeson denied the request in an order today.
