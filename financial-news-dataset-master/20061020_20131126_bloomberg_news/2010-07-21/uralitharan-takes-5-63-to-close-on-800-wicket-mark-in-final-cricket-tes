             Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah
Muralitharan lifted his record tally of Test wickets to 797 in
his final match before quitting cricket’s elite format.   
 Needing eight wickets to become the first bowler to reach
the 800 mark, Muralitharan took 5-63 to help bowl out India for
276 on day four of the series-opening match in Galle.   
 Sri Lanka enforced the follow-on after making 520-8
declared in its first innings, meaning India will go straight
back out to bat in its second innings.
