             Japanese  stocks  fell for the fourth
consecutive day, reversing morning gains after the stronger yen
hurt the earnings outlook for exporters, and Mizuho Securities
Co. rated construction companies “underperform.”  
 Toyota Motor Corp. , a carmaker that gets about 70 percent
of its sales abroad, fell 0.8 percent as investors bought the
yen as a refuge from concern about the U.S. economic recovery
and the health of European banks. Toshiba Corp., an electronics
maker that earns more than half of its revenue outside Japan,
lost 0.7 percent. Obayashi Corp. and Shimizu Corp. led
contractors lower following the Mizuho rating.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.2 percent to 9,278.83
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index lost 0.3 percent
to 829.35, with almost three shares declining for each that rose.  
 “Many people are bearish about the stock market,” said
 Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee $2.2 billion at Tokyo-based
Mizuho Asset Management Co. “Europe’s economy isn’t good. The
U.S. economy is not recovering as quickly as investors had
expected.”  
 Nineteen companies in the Nikkei 225, including Nomura
Holdings Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc., sank to  52-week lows 
today, while only All Nippon Airways Co. advanced to a 52-week
high. The gauge has fallen 18 percent from its 52-week high on
April 5, approaching the 20 percent threshold that some analysts
consider as signaling the beginning of a bear market.  
 Cheapest Since 2008  
 Today’s declines cut the average price of stocks in the
Topix to 16.14 times  estimated earnings , near the 16.12 times
reached on July 1, the lowest level since November 2008.  
 Toyota , the world’s largest automaker, sank 0.8 percent to
3,030 yen and Nissan Motor Co., which is Japan’s No. 3 automaker
and gets more than 75 percent of its revenue abroad, fell 1
percent to 607 yen.  
 Toshiba, whose products range from televisions and washing
machines to nuclear reactors, lost 0.7 percent to 444 yen. Fanuc
Ltd., a maker of industrial robots that earns about 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, slumped 0.6 percent to 9,890 yen, the
second-biggest drag on the Nikkei 225. Makers of cars and
electronics were the  heaviest drags  on the Topix among its 33
industry groups.  
 The yen rose against 15 of its 16 major counterparts on
speculation stress-test results this week will show European
banks require funds to cope with possible loan losses. The
Dollar Index traded near an 11-week low before Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke speaks on the economy and ahead of data
that are forecast to show U.S. initial jobless claims increased
and existing home sales fell.  
 ‘Weaker Momentum’  
 “The slowdown in the U.S. economy has just started and
it’s hard to see the situation turn into a recovery,” said
 Kazuyuki Terao , chief investment officer of RCM Japan Ltd.
“Exporters may face weaker momentum for an earnings recovery.”  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 87.07 against the dollar
from 87.41 at the opening of stock trading today in Tokyo.
Against the euro, it strengthened to as much as 112.11 from
112.81. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  
 Kajima Corp. , Shimizu Corp., Taisei Corp. and Obayashi
Corp., Japan’s largest building contractors, slumped more than
1.5 percent after Mizuho rated them “underperform” in new
coverage.
