             India’s stocks rose for the first
time in three days as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said the
nation’s food inflation may moderate, easing concerns of further
increases in interest rates.  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the nation’s largest
copper producer, advanced the most in a month as metal prices
climbed. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. climbed 2.4 percent on plans
to introduce its first motorcycles within the next few months.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
rose 99.09, or 0.6 percent, to 17,977.23. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange gained 0.6 percent to
5399.35. The  BSE 200 Index  advanced 0.5 percent to 2,290.76.  
 “Once inflation is down, the chances of increasing
interest rates is minimal,” said  Kishor Ostwal , chairman and
managing director of CNI Research Ltd. in Mumbai. “In the long-
term, it’s good for the markets.”  
 India’s food inflation may moderate after the harvest of
crops, Mukherjee said in Hyderabad yesterday. He also said that
price increases remain a matter of concern. The nation’s
inflation rate of 13.9 percent is the highest among 17 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  
 The accelerating price increases prompted the Reserve Bank
of India to raise its benchmark interest rate three times this
year, and it’s due to announce the next monetary policy decision
on July 27. All 16 economists  surveyed  so far by Bloomberg News
expect the reverse repurchase rate to be raised next week by a
quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent. India’s 10-year
 bond  yields are at the highest level in a month on speculation
of the increase.  
 Sensex Rally  
 Ostwal said the central bank may not increase lending rates
next week. An easing inflation outlook, along with a good
monsoon, government policies and earnings growth may help the
Sensex rally further,  Suresh Mahadevan , an analyst at UBS AG,
said in a report received today. The analyst has a March 2011
target of 22,000 for the gauge, representing a 12 percent gain
from yesterday’s close. Laggards on the BSE 100 Index including
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.  and  Steel Authority of India Ltd.  may
offer “interesting” investment ideas, Mahadevan said.  
 The condition of monsoon-sown crops is good and there will
be “substantial improvement” in sowing during the rest of the
season, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  told reporters yesterday.  
 Mahindra  
 Mahindra & Mahindra , the nation’s biggest maker of sport-
utility vehicles, rose 2.4 percent to 616.75 rupees as its new
plans will help the company challenge Hero Honda Motors Ltd. in
the world’s second-biggest two-wheeler market.  
 Mahindra intends to add motorbikes ranging from low-cost
entry models to premium products,  Anoop Mathur , the head of
Mahindra’s two-wheeler business, said in an interview at the
company’s Mumbai headquarters yesterday. He declined to
elaborate further on the product plan.  
 Stocks also gained as foreign investors bought more Indian
equities than they sold for a 10th day. Overseas  funds  bought a
net  2.04 billion rupees  ($43.3 million) of Indian equities on
July 19, raising total investments in the stocks this year to
403.2 billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Foreign fund inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2
billion rupees in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in
local currency terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured
foreign funds. They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares
in 2008, triggering a record annual decline.  
 Sterlite gained 4.2 percent to 173.25 rupees, the highest
in a month. The price of copper climbed for a third day in Asia
as inventories extended the longest string of declines in more
than a year, signaling steady demand. Hindalco Industries Ltd.,
India’s biggest aluminum producer, rose 2.4 percent to 156.45,
its highest level in two months as the metal’s price increased.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
      Hindustan Media Ventures Ltd.  (HMVL IN), which raised 2.7
billion rupees in an initial share sale, climbed 14 percent to
188.95 rupees in its trading debut.  
 Monsanto India Ltd.  (MCHM IN), a chemical manufacturer,
gained 4.1 percent to 1,735.35 rupees after reporting quarterly
net income rose 13 percent.  
 Panacea Biotec Ltd.  (PNCB IN), a drugmaker, increased 1.4
percent to 196.65 rupees after saying first-quarter profit more
than doubled.  
 SKF India Ltd.  (SKF IN), the nation’s second-biggest maker
of ball bearings by market value, rose 4.1 percent to 534.35
rupees, its highest close in at least 19 years, after second-
quarter profit more than doubled.  
 TVS Motor Co.  (TVSL IN), India’s third-largest
motorcycle maker, surged 5.6 percent to 128.5 rupees, the
highest level in more than four years. The company will give
investors one free share for every one held, it said when
reporting quarterly profit more than doubled on higher sales.
