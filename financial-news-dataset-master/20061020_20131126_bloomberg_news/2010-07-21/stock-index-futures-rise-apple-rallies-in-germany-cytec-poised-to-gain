             U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses after advancing for two days as Yahoo! Inc. and Gilead
Sciences Inc. reported revenue below analyst estimates, while
Apple Inc. topped earnings predictions.  
 Yahoo! fell 9.2 percent and Gilead Sciences declined 1.5
percent. Apple rallied 4.8 percent after net income increased 78
percent on record revenue fueled by demand for iPads and
iPhones.  Morgan Stanley , owner of the world’s biggest brokerage,
climbed 8.1 percent after profit topped estimates on higher
trading revenue.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent to 1,081.53 as of 9:55 a.m. in
New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 12.26
points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,217.70. About three stocks
declined for each that advanced on U.S. exchanges.  
 “Yesterday’s rally was an anomaly and today we’re returning
to the past week’s weak market,” said  Jon Fisher , who helps
manage about $18 billion as a money manager at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Minneapolis. “It’s a below-average economic
recovery and investors need to recalibrate their expectations
like consumers and businesses already have done.”  
 The S&P 500 advanced 6 percent from July 2 through
yesterday on optimism about corporate earnings. Of the 75
companies in the gauge that have reported from July 12 through
this morning, all but 12 beat their per-share  earnings 
forecasts, Bloomberg data shows. The gauge posted a 16 percent
decline from this year’s high in April through July 2 amid
concern economic growth in the U.S. and China is slowing,
pushing the price-to-earnings ratio down to 14.3, the lowest
valuation since April 2009.  
 Yesterday’s Rally  
 Stocks rallied yesterday as higher copper and oil prices
boosted commodity producers and investors speculated Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will announce plans to
stimulate the economy. Bernanke delivers his semi-annual report
on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee today and
will testify at the House Financial Services Committee tomorrow.  
 An index of mortgage applications in the U.S. increased
last week to the highest level in nine months as record-low
borrowing costs boosted refinancing. The Mortgage Bankers
Association’s  index  rose 7.6 percent in the week ended July 16,
the Washington-based group said today.  
 Starbucks Corp. and eBay Inc. are among companies scheduled
to report quarterly results after U.S. exchanges close today.  
 Yahoo!, the owner of the second-most popular U.S. Internet
search engine, lost 9.2 percent to $13.80 after reporting
second-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates as
marketers devoted online advertising spending to rival sites.  
 Gilead Sciences declined 1.5 percent to $32.51. The world’s
largest maker of AIDS drugs reduced its annual sales forecast
after second-quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  
 Apple rose 2.9 percent to $259.15 after reporting results
for the first quarter to include sales of the iPad tablet
computer and the latest iPhone. Apple said yesterday that
revenue in the three months that end in September will be about
$18 billion. Analysts had predicted sales of $17 billion.  
 Seagate Technology slid 7 percent to $13.52 as its fiscal
fourth-quarter revenue of $2.66 billion fell short of the $2.84
billion average estimate by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
