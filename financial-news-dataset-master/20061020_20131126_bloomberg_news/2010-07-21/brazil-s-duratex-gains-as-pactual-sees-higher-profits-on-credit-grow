             Duratex SA , a Brazilian producer of
wood panels and bathroom fixtures, gained the most in two weeks
after Banco BTG Pactual SA said the company will benefit from
growing credit in Latin America’s biggest economy.  
 “The company is very leveraged to the domestic macro
outlook, and should benefit from credit expansion and better
income distribution,” Pactual said in an e-mail to clients
today. “We continue to project double-digit profit growth over
the next three years.”  
 Brazil’s government may reduce reserve requirements on
savings deposits in a bid to step up loans for homebuyers,  O
Globo  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information. Finance Ministry officials didn’t answer calls from
Bloomberg News to their office and mobile phones.  
 Duratex gained 3.3 percent in Sao Paulo trading to 17.66
reais at 11:02 a.m. New York time. Shares earlier rose as much
as 4 percent, the most on an intraday basis since July 6.  
 The company is also a “strong buy” because of prospects
for price increases and mergers and acquisitions in the
industry, according to Pactual.
