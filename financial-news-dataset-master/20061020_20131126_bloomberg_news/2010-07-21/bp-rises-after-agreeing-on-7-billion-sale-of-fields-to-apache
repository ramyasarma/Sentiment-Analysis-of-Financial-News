             BP Plc  rose in London trading after
agreeing to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S., Canada and
Egypt to  Apache Corp.  for $7 billion, raising cash to meet the
costs of the Gulf of Mexico spill.  
 BP  climbed  3.2 percent to close at 399.9 pence. The stock
is down 39 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on
April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill
in U.S. history.  
 Europe’s largest oil producer by volume said last month it
would sell $10 billion of assets to raise cash for the $20
billion fund demanded by President  Barack Obama  to compensate
victims of the oil spill. BP said yesterday that it plans to
sell assets in Pakistan and Vietnam, and the company was said to
be in talks with Apache earlier this week about selling half its
stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay oil field.  
 “It’s a nice tidying up of the portfolio,” said  Iain Armstrong , an analyst at Brewin Dolphin Ltd., which overseas
more than $31 billion in London, including BP shares. “If they
can get rid of Vietnam and Pakistan assets as well, even
better.”  
 Apache will buy BP’s Permian Basin holdings in Texas and
southeast New Mexico and gas properties in western Canada,
London-based BP said yesterday after the close of trading. BP
also agreed to sell exploration concessions in Egypt.  
 Cash Deposit  
 BP said Apache will pay a deposit of $5 billion in cash on
July 30. The total price of $7 billion includes $3.1 billion for
the Permian properties, $3.25 billion for assets in western
Canada and $650 million for the Egyptian assets, according to
BP’s statement.  
 The Prudhoe Bay stake was on track to be sold for  $10
billion to $11 billion, according to a person with knowledge of
the matter.  Jason Kenney , an analyst at ING Wholesale Banking in
Edinburgh, values BP’s assets in Vietnam and Pakistan at about
$1.7 billion altogether.  
 BP suspended its $10 billion annual dividend for three
quarters and cut investment spending to help pay for spill
costs, which Brewin Dolphin’s Armstrong predicts will reach $40
billion. BP reports second-quarter earnings July 27.  
 Robert Dudley , the BP executive running the spill cleanup
operation, is the front-runner to replace Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Hayward , who is set to step down in the next 10
weeks, the London-based Times reported today, citing
unidentified people close to the company.  
 Hayward has the full support of the board and will stay in
his post, a BP spokesman said.
