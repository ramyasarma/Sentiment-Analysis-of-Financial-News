             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. 
is currently in talks with more than one Brazilian company
over potential listing, according  Lawrence Fok , the bourse’s
chief marketing officer.  
 “There is a natural resources company from Brazil which
may be interested in doing a secondary listing in Hong Kong,”
Fok said at a meeting in Tokyo, citing Hong Kong Exchanges’
Chairman  Ronald Arculli .  
 Agrifirma Brazil, a business backed by  Jacob Rothschild , is
hoping to become the first Brazilian company to offer shares in
the city, the Financial Times reported on July 18, citing the
company’s Chairman  Ian Watson . Fok declined to confirm the
report.  
 The operator of Asia’s third-biggest stock market has 
held talks with Brazil’s bourse over potential listing 
of Brazilian companies in Hong Kong and Hong Kong companies 
in the South American country, Arculli said on June 22. The 
Hong Kong Exchange is aiming to attract new international 
listings, particularly in the metals, mining and energy 
industries, according to the exchange’s 2010 to 2012 strategic 
 plan .  
 Fok said the bourse was also interested in attracting
listings from companies that can take advantage of China’s move
from an export-driven economy to one where domestic consumption
plays a larger part.  
 “I would expect a lot of investors to be interested in
companies relating to the Chinese consumption story,” he said,
citing  L’Occitane International SA , the first French company to
hold an initial public offering in Hong Kong, as an example.
Shares of L’Occitane have gained 20 percent since the company
listed in the city on May 7.
