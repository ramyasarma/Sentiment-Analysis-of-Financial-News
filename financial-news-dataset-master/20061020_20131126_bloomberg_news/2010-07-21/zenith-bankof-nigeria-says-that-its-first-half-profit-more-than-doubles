             Zenith Bank Plc , a Nigerian lender,
said profit for the first-half ended June 30 more than doubled
from the year earlier.  
 Net income surged to 21.3 billion naira ($141 million)
compared with 9.85 billion naira a year earlier, the company
said in a statement e-mailed by the Nigerian Stock Exchange in
Lagos today. Revenue decreased to 96.9 billion naira from 111.1
billion naira.  
 Zenith is one of 14 out of Nigeria’s 24 lenders that passed
an audit last year by the central bank. The Central Bank of
Nigeria bailed out the other 10 with a 620 billion naira cash
injection and fired the executives of eight of them after a debt
crisis.  
 “The rescued banks have lost to stronger banks like
Zenith,” Bismarck Rewane, Chief executive officer of Financial
Derivatives Co. Ltd., a Lagos-based consultancy, said in an
interview.  
 Zenith’s shares have risen 43 percent over the last year,
closing trade 0.8 percent up at 12.5 naira as of 1:30 p.m. in
Lagos. Spring Bank Plc, one of the banks that was bailed out,
 has lost 90 percent  of its market value over the same period.  
 Jim Ovia , Zenith’s Chief executive Officer is due to retire
at the end of this month, in compliance with a directive by the
central bank that bank chiefs who have held office for 10 years
should step down.
