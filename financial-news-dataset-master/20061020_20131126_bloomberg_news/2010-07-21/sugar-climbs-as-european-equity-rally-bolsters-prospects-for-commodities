             Raw-sugar prices rose for the second
time in three days as an equity rally bolstered the outlook for
commodity demand.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed
as much as 0.8 percent as European stocks and most Asian markets
gained on earnings reports. This week, sugar prices reached 17.7
cents a pound, the highest level since April 15.  
 “It’s all demand driven,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst
at Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida. “Companies are doing
well. Demand for commodities is starting to pick up, and sugar
is tying into that.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery rose 0.19 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 17.47 cents on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
price has climbed 34 percent from a 13-month low of 13 cents on
May 7.  
 Sugar may reach 18.5 cents in the next two weeks, Tintle
said. The most-active contract last reached that level on
March 22.  
 The six main sugar ports in Brazil, the world’s largest
producer, had a record 111 vessels delayed yesterday. That
triggered “tightness” in supplies, said  Nick Penney , a senior
trader at Sucden Financial Ltd. in London.  
 The backlog rose from 103 ships a week ago.  
 In London, refined-sugar futures for October delivery
gained $3.90, or 0.7 percent, to $542.20 a metric ton on the
Liffe exchange.
