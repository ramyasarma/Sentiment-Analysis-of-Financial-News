             China Merchants Securities Co. and
Haitong Securities Co. were upgraded by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts Richard Xu and Ning Ma, who said they were turning
“more constructive” on Chinese brokerages given the “sharply
lower” valuations and a possible rebound in turnover.  
 China Merchants Securities was raised to “buy” from
“neutral” and Haitong Securities was upgraded to “neutral”
from “sell.” The analysts also downgraded China Everbright
Ltd. to “neutral” from “buy.”
