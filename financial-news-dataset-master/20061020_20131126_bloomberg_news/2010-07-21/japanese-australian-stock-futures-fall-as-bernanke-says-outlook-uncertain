             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the U.S. economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , a Japanese
electronics maker that earns more than 20 percent of sales in
the U.S., lost 1.3 percent from yesterday’s closing share price
in Tokyo as the dollar weakened against the yen. Those of Toyota
Motor Corp., a Japanese carmaker that gets about 70 percent of
its sales abroad, slid 0.8 percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum
Ltd. , Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer, sank 1 percent
from the closing share price in Sydney as oil prices retreated.  
 “The Bernanke testimony disappointed people,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Investors won’t
be inclined to buy Japanese shares until they feel certain the
Bank of Japan is taking measures against the stronger yen.”  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in September closed at 9,200 in Chicago yesterday,
compared with 9,285 in Singapore. Futures were bid in the pre-
market at 9,210 in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time.
Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 1.1 percent today.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.5 percent in Wellington.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. In New York yesterday, the index fell 1.3 percent after
Bernanke’s comments to the Senate Banking Committee.  
 Bernanke Testimony  
 While Fed officials plan for the exit, “we also recognize
that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain,”
Bernanke said in testimony to the committee. “We will continue
to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic developments,
and we remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed
to foster a return to full utilization of our nation’s
productive potential in a context of price stability.”  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 86.79 against the dollar
today in Tokyo from 87.10 at yesterday’s close of stock trading.
Against the euro, the yen strengthened to as much as 110.81 from
112.26. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell 1.3 percent to settle
at $76.56 a barrel in New York yesterday.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.2 percent yesterday. The
gauge has slumped 10 percent from this year’s high on April 15
as Europe’s debt crisis and China’s steps to curb property
prices fueled concern that global economic growth will slow.
Speculation the U.S. economy will contract intensified as
reports pointed to a retreat in manufacturing and home sales.  
 The declines have cut the average price of stocks in the
MSCI gauge to 13.97 times  estimated earnings , near the 13.72
times on July 2 that was the lowest level since December 2008.
