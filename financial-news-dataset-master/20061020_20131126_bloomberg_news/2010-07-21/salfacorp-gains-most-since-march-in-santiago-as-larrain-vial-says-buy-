             Salfacorp SA  rose the most in almost
four months after Larrain Vial gave the country’s biggest
builder by sales a “buy’ rating on prospects it will benefit
from new projects.  
 Salfacorp gained 3.8 percent to 1,204.9 pesos, the biggest
increase since March 29.  Rival Besalco SA  jumped 7.7 percent to
a record 579.66 pesos after Larrain Vial analyst  Jorge Opaso 
rated it “attractive” in a note today.  
 Chile is seeking investment of $14 billion in public works
projects through 2014 to improve roadways and rebuild
infrastructure damaged in a February earthquake, Public Works
Minister  Hernan De Solminihac  said yesterday. Engineering and
construction companies also stand to benefit from planned
private mining and energy projects, Opaso said.  
 “Salfacorp and Besalco enjoy the best positioning given
their capacity and experience to tap into this potential,” he
wrote.  
 The government aims to spend $6 billion on public works and
attract an additional $8 billion in investment from companies,
De Solminihac said yesterday at a conference hosted by Chile’s
construction chamber in Santiago. Projects would include more
than $2 billion in highway improvements and urban and airport
construction, he said.  
 The Ipsa equity index rose 1.1 percent to 4,286.14.  
 Chile’s economy may expand 4.3 percent this year and 6
percent in 2011, making it the fastest-growing major economy in
the region, the United Nations’ economic unit for the region
said today in a statement. The economy is recovering from
February’s 8.8-magnitude earthquake and last year’s slump.
