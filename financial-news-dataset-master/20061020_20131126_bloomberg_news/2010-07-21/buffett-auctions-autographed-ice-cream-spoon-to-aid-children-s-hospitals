             Warren Buffett , who raised a record
$2.63 million last month in an auction for his charity lunch,
has autographed a five-pound ice-cream spoon that will be sold
to the highest bidder to raise funds for children’s hospitals.  
 Bidding for the oversized spoon, sponsored by the Dairy
Queen unit at Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , is run by  EBay
Inc.  and will be held through July 30, according to a Business
Wire statement distributed today by the ice-cream company and
the Children’s Miracle Network. The  top bid  for the spoon was
$2,357 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York.  
 Buffett, the world’s third-richest person, has promised to
give 99 percent of his fortune to charity. Buffett’s chosen
charities include programs to ease world hunger, boost education
in the U.S. and promote access to abortions. Last month he
announced an effort to coax fellow billionaires into committing
at least half their wealth to philanthropy.  
 “Fate’s distribution of long straws is wildly capricious”
Buffett wrote in a  letter  on Fortune’s website last month saying
the rich have a special responsibility to aid the needy.  
 He made his largest donation since the 2008 financial
crisis this year, giving $1.6 billion to the foundation
established by  Bill Gates .  
 Buffett has held 11 auctions in which the winning bidder
and guests get to lunch with him. This year’s lunch bid
surpassed the previous record of $2.11 million in 2008.
