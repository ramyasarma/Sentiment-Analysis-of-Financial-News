             Deutsche Bank AG,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  and Morgan Stanley were chosen by  American
International Group Inc.  to arrange a Hong Kong initial public
offering of its main Asia life insurance unit, three people with
knowledge of the plan said.  
 The underwriting banks will meet tomorrow with  AIA Group
Ltd. , AIG’s Hong Kong-based unit, to discuss its IPO, two of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is
private. AIG plans to sell shares in the unit as early as this
year, the people said.  
 The New York-based company, which is selling assets to
repay a $182.3 billion bailout by the U.S., is revisiting plans
for a Hong Kong offering of AIA after  Prudential Plc  scrapped
its purchase of the unit. London-based Prudential’s $35.5
billion takeover bid for AIA collapsed on June 2 after investors
including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments said the deal
was too costly.  
 AIG last year hired New York-based Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt as co-global coordinators of AIA’s
IPO. It added more bookrunners including Goldman Sachs and
Zurich-based UBS AG, people with knowledge of the matter said in
February.  Patricia Chua , a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for AIA,
declined to comment. Spokesmen at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment.  
 Market Value  
 Goldman and Citigroup Inc. of New York earlier estimated
AIA would be worth $32 billion to $34 billion, and Morgan
Stanley estimated the value at $34 billion to $36 billion,
people with knowledge of the figures said in June.  
 AIA has more than 23 million customers and offices in at
least 15 countries including China, India and Australia. The
unit had about $1.44 billion in operating profit in 2009, down
from $1.59 billion in 2008, Prudential said in a March filing.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  has overhauled
AIA’s management, telling staff this week that he named  Mark Tucker  to replace former head  Mark Wilson  to have the “best team
on the field” for the IPO.  
 The unit’s public offering would be “ready to go in the
coming months when market conditions are optimal,” Benmosche
said in a memo to staff, adding that he couldn’t speculate about
the precise timing.
