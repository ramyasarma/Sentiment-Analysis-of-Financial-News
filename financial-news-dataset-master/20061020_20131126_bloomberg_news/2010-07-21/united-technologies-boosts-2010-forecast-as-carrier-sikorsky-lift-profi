             United Technologies Corp.  raised its
annual earnings forecast and posted its second consecutive
increase in quarterly profit after a year of declines, driven by
sales at its Carrier, Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky units.  
 Second-quarter  net income  rose 14 percent to $1.11 billion,
or $1.20 a share, from $976 million, or $1.05, the Hartford,
Connecticut-based company said in a statement today. That
exceeded $1.16, the average estimate of 10  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue grew 5.3 percent to $13.9 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  has cut about
18,000 jobs over the past two years, paring costs to prop up
profit as the economy improves. Orders are advancing at the Otis
and Carrier units, which make elevators and air conditioners,
while sales of Pratt & Whitney’s spare parts for aircraft climb
with a rebound in commercial flights worldwide. Operating profit
rose in all six of the company’s divisions.  
 “We view the quarter as very solid and balanced for United
Technologies, with sales and earnings beating our
expectations,” said  Joel Levington , managing director of
corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. “We
are particularly pleased with Carrier’s operating performance.”  
 The company boosted its 2010 per-share  profit forecast  to
as much as $4.70 from a maximum of $4.65. That includes about 20
cents a share for anticipated restructuring costs, which weren’t
specified, and one-time items. Analysts had predicted $4.68, the
average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Earnings were $4.12 a share for 2009 at United
Technologies, which also makes Sikorsky helicopters, and
Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace equipment.  
 Currency Hedges  
 United Technologies dropped 51 cents to $67.03 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have lost
3.4 percent this year.  
 Currency hedges, including translation of international
sales into U.S. dollars, for the Pratt & Whitney Canada unit
boosted profit by 3 cents a share, United Technologies said. The
company gets about 60 percent of its sales from outside the
U.S., with about a quarter from Europe.  
 The euro touched a four-year low against the dollar in June
on concern the sovereign debt crisis will spread. The European
currency was down 0.5 percent against the dollar at $1.2811 as
of 9:42 a.m. in New York.  
 Chief Financial Officer  Greg Hayes  said on a conference
call with analysts today that the profit forecast now assumes
the euro at $1.25, down from a $1.48 projection in December.  
 Stock Buybacks  
 The company raised its share  repurchase  target to $2
billion for 2010, up from a previous goal of $1.5 billion.  
 Orders are rising at its Carrier unit, advancing 39 percent
at its Transicold refrigeration division and 6 percent in the
commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning segment.  
 New equipment orders at Otis climbed 12 percent including
the effects of currency exchange.  
 Spare-parts and equipment orders at Pratt & Whitney rose 8
percent, while Hamilton Sundstrand’s increased 7 percent from a
year earlier.  
 Sikorsky has seen sales and profit advance in the past two
years as it supplies the Pentagon with upgraded Black Hawk
helicopters and develops new  products . Its revenue rose 22
percent in the quarter. The company announced today an order for
12 S76D model executive helicopters from Saudi Arabia.
