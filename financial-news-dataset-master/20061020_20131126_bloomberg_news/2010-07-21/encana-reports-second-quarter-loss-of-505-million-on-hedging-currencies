             EnCana Corp ., Canada’s biggest
natural-gas producer, increased its output forecast this year
and added to its acreage in fuel-rich shale formations.  
 The company produced 12 percent more gas per share in the
second quarter than the same period last year and boosted its
output forecast to 3.365 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent a
day, up 2 percent, according to a statement today. EnCana, based
in Calgary, said it will increase capital investment 11 percent
to $5 billion for 2010 to help growth next year.  
 The company said it has acquired about 250,000 net acres of
land in the Collingwood gas shale formation in Michigan. It also
said production in the Haynesville shale in the U.S. South will
end the year at about 500 million cubic feet a day. Shale is a
dense rock formation that requires the use of a high-pressure
mix of water, sand and chemicals to fracture rocks and make gas
flow.  
 New York gas futures averaged 14 percent higher for the
second quarter than a year earlier as a recovering U.S. economy
boosted demand for the fuel.  
 EnCana posted a $505 million loss in the second quarter as
currency fluctuations increased foreign debt and hedging
contracts locking in fuel prices dropped in value. The net loss
was 68 cents a share, compared with net income of $92 million,
or 32 cents, a year earlier.  
 The results don’t include EnCana’s oil-production and
refining units, which were spun off as  Cenovus Energy Inc.  on
Nov. 30.  
 Shale Partners  
 The company reported operating earnings of 11 cents a
share, excluding changes in the value of hedging contracts and
long-term debt. It was expected to earn 24 cents a share, the
average of 14 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Randy Eresman  said in an interview
last month the company is actively looking for partners to
defray the cost of exploring and developing its holdings in
shale formations in Canada and the U.S.  
 EnCana signed a memorandum of understanding last month with
China National Petroleum Corp., which may lead to a venture with
the company to produce gas from shale in northeastern British
Columbia.  
 EnCana fell 5 cents to C$34.44 at 8:43 a.m., before the
start of regular trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The
stock, which has 10 buy, 1 sell and 13 hold ratings from
analysts, had risen 1.1 percent this year before today.  
 (EnCana is scheduled to hold an earnings conference call
for investors and analysts, starting at 1 p.m. New York time. To
