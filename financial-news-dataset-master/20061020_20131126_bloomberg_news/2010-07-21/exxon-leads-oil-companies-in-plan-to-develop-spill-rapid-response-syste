             Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp. ,
 ConocoPhillips  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc plan to build and
deploy a $1 billion rapid-response system to capture and contain
oil in the event of a future underwater well blowout.  
 The four companies will contribute $250 million each toward
the creation of a non-profit organization, the Marine Well
Containment Co., that will create and manage containment
equipment and responses in the Gulf of Mexico,  Alan Jeffers , an
Exxon spokesman, said today in a phone interview.  
 “Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering
construction phase, but the plan is to set up a non-profit
organization that will ultimately manage this,” Jeffers said.
“It’s still in the development stages, but we’re going to ask
others to join and those who choose not to join can have access
to the equipment via commercial arrangements.”  
 BP Plc, which has been struggling to contain an underwater
oil gusher after a Gulf rig exploded in April, wasn’t listed as
a participant.  
 “Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,”  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, said in a phone
interview. “We’ve said from early on that there will be lessons
learned from this incident and we’re sure that changes will be
made in the industry.”  
 As part of the new initiative led by Exxon, the biggest
U.S. oil company, equipment will be designed for several
scenarios up to 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) in depth specific to
conditions in the Gulf. The system will be able to mobilize
within 24 hours and have initial capacity to contain 100,000
barrels a day, according to an e-mailed statement.  
 Additional costs for equipment, contracts and new vessels
may increase the $1 billion commitment, according to the
statement. The companies said in the statement that they have
reviewed the system with Congress.
