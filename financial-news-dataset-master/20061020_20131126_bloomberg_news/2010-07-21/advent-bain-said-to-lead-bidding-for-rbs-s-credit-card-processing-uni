             Advent International Corp. and Bain
Capital LLC submitted the leading bid for  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc’s  credit-card payment processing unit valued at as
much as 2.5 billion pounds ($3.8 billion), two people with
direct knowledge of the matter said.  
 RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, may select a
winning bidder before reporting earnings on Aug. 6, one of the
people said, declining to be identified because the details are
private. RBS may narrow the list of bidders for the WorldPay
unit in the next week, the person said.  
 TPG,  David Bonderman ’s private-equity firm, and New York-
based Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC made separate offers and
Advent and Bain made a joint one, the people said. Edinburgh-
based  RBS  is selling assets including WorldPay, 318 U.K. bank
branches and its insurance division after receiving 45.5 billion
pounds of funding from the U.K. government during the credit
crisis, more than any other bank in the world.  
 RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  is shrinking the
bank, which last year posted the biggest annual loss in U.K.
corporate history. WorldPay could fetch as much as 2.5 billion
pounds, people familiar with the matter said last month.  
 Officials at Boston-based Advent International and Clayton,
Dubilier & Rice and a spokesman for Boston-based Bain declined
to comment. TPG couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  
 Buyout Boom  
 WorldPay operates in more than 40 countries and provides
credit-card payment processing services to clients including
small- and medium-sized businesses. It’s among the 10 largest
processors of online payments in the U.S., according to RBS’s
website.  
 Private-equity firms are rushing to put an estimated $500
billion in unused capital commitments to work after credit and
stock markets thawed, according to London-based research company
Preqin Ltd.  
 Firms announced $40.7 billion in company buyouts so far
this year, compared with $7.85 billion a year ago. The volume is
still less than a 10th the $414 billion announced in the same
period three years ago, when the buyout boom peaked.
