             Tiger Woods  remains the top-earning
U.S. athlete even though the golfer’s endorsement income fell by
about $22 million following his admission of infidelity,
according to  Sports Illustrated .  
 Woods had $20.5 million in winnings and $70 million in
endorsement income to top SI.com’s  “Fortunate 50” list  for the
seventh time in the seven years it’s been published.  
 Endorsers such as  Accenture Plc ,  AT&T Inc. , Procter &
Gamble Co.’s Gillette razors and  PepsiCo Inc. ’s Gatorade ended
their relationships with Woods, who took almost five months off
from golf. His endorsement income a year ago was estimated to be
$92 million, according to SI.  
 Before his off-course problems, Woods won six tournaments
and $10.5 million in purses in 2009, his third-best season since
turning professional in 1996. He also won a $10 million bonus
for the season-long FedEx Cup title.  
 Fellow golfer  Phil Mickelson  is again second to Woods at
$61.6 million, up from $52.9 million the previous year. Boxer
 Floyd Mayweather  ranked third, with $60 million of his $60.3
million coming from fight purses and pay-per-view sales.  
 LeBron James , who earlier this month left the Cleveland
Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat, ranks fourth at $45.8
million and was the top-earning player in the National
Basketball Association.  
 A-Rod Is Fifth  
 Alex Rodriguez  of Major League Baseball’s New York Yankees
is fifth with $37 million, including $33 million in salary. His
endorsements dropped by about $2 million last year, according to
SI.  
 NBA players  Shaquille O’Neal  ($36 million) and  Kobe Bryant 
($33 million) rank sixth and seventh, followed by the Yankees’
 Derek Jeter  ($31 million).  
 Indianapolis Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning  was the top-
earning National Football League player at $30.8 million, while
 Dwyane Wade  of the Heat rounds out SI.com’s top-10 at $27.8
million.  
 Sports Illustrated uses data from the current or most
recently completed basketball and baseball seasons, and the
coming 2010 season for the NFL. Winnings for individual sports,
such as golf, tennis and auto racing, are from 2009. All
endorsement and appearance income is for this year.  
 Tennis player  Roger Federer  tops SI.com’s list of top-
earning athletes from outside the U.S. with $61.8 million. He’s
followed by soccer players  Lionel Messi  ($44 million),  David Beckham  ($40.5 million) and  Cristiano Ronaldo  ($40 million), and
boxer  Manny Pacquiao  ($38 million).
