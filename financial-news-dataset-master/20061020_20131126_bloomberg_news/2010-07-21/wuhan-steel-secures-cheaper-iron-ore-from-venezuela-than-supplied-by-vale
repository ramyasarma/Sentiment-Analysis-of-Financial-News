             Wuhan Iron & Steel Group , China’s
third-biggest steelmaker, said it will buy iron ore from Corp.
Venezolana de Guayana at a lower price than what  Vale SA  , the
world’s largest supplier, is charging.  
 The price will be at least $20 less for each dry metric ton,
compared with what Vale is charging Japanese and South Korean
steelmakers in the third quarter, Wuhan Steel said today in a
 statement  on its website, without giving details.  
 The two companies signed a supply contract in October,
paving the way for China, the largest buyer of iron ore, to set
prices separately from the rest of the world. Vale,  Rio Tinto
Group  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the three biggest suppliers, this
year abandoned a 40-year custom of setting annual prices in
favor of quarterly pacts, ignoring protests from Chinese
steelmakers.  
 “This is the first-ever contract under China prices,”
Wuhan Steel said in the statement. “It’s also a significant
starting point to move away from control by the world’s top
three mining giants.”  
 Wuhan in October agreed to buy more than 40 million tons of
ore in total under a 7-year contract with the Venezuelan company,
also known as CVG, the statement said. The average cost for the
ore arriving at Wuhan’s plants was 668 yuan ($99) per dry ton in
2009, lower than the spot market, it said.  
 The Venezuelan contract also helped Wuhan to fulfill its
shipping agreements on the South America-China route, it said.
