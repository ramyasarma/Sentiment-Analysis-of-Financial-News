             The euro’s declines against the
dollar may be limited should some European banks fail the stress
tests due for publication this week, Commerzbank AG said.  
 “While rumor has it that not all banks have passed the
test, this, however, is not necessarily a piece of bad news for
the euro,” Commerzbank analysts, including  Ulrich Leuchtmann ,
wrote in a note today. “If only a limited number of financial
institutions need to make adjustments, this could be seen as a
sign that the test was not too easy.”  
 Many “market participants are unwilling to enter new
positions” until the July 23 publication stress tests,
Commerzbank wrote.  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine if they can survive potential losses on sovereign-
bond holdings.  
 The euro was 0.4 percent lower against the dollar at
$1.2823 as of 11:22 a.m. in London, down from a two-month high
of $1.3029 yesterday.
