             Chemtura Corp., a bankrupt plastic-
additives maker, won court approval of the rough terms of its
plan to reorganize, as a judge said shareholders could raise
objections again at a hearing to confirm the plan in September.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber said his approval is
conditional, as the so-called disclosure statement should be
entered in court documents with some changes.
