             Coca-Cola Co. , the world’s largest
soft-drink maker, posted a 16 percent increase in second-quarter
profit as North American sales volumes climbed for the first
time since 2007.  
 Net income  rose to $2.37 billion, or $1.02 a share, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.06, compared with the $1.03  average  of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Beverage volume in North America advanced 2
percent, compared with a 1 percent decline a year ago.  
 The volume growth in North America, Coca-Cola’s largest
market, exceeded predictions from analysts such as  Mark Swartzberg  at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Coca-Cola benefited from
marketing tied to the 2010 World Cup and from surging sales of
sports beverages like Powerade.  
 “They are having great success with their investments and
marketing,” Agata Kaczanowska, a beverage-industry analyst for
market researcher IBISWorld in Santa Monica, California, said
today in an interview. “People will invest a couple of bucks to
cool off and refresh themselves.”  
 Coca-Cola gained 84 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $54.08 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
stock has dropped 5.1 percent this year, while rival PepsiCo
Inc. gained 5.2 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
declined 4.1 percent.  
 Coca-Cola’s growth outstripped PepsiCo’s in North America,
where a drop in consumer confidence has escalated competition.
PepsiCo posted a 1 percent decline in North American volume in
the second quarter excluding the effect of a distribution deal
with Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  
 Global Results  
 Global sales by drink volume grew 5 percent at Coca-Cola,
with the Eurasia and Africa unit showing the fastest growth at
10 percent. Coca-Cola used the World Cup soccer tournament,
hosted by South Africa, to stage its largest marketing campaign,
covering 160 countries and attracting more customers.  
 European sales by drink volume fell 1 percent, hurt by
“ongoing challenges” in southern and eastern Europe, Coca-Cola
said. Volume growth in the Pacific region, which amounted to 6
percent in the  quarter , was hampered by bad weather in parts of
China and Japan, according to the beverage maker.  
 “Consumer sentiment is still not out of the tunnel, in
terms of employment, in terms of real estate, in terms of
banking, in terms of investment,” Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Muhtar Kent  said today said during a telephone call with
reporters. “We do see rays of hope.”  
 Total sales advanced 4.9 percent to $8.67 billion. A year
earlier, second-quarter  profit  at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola was
$2.04 billion, or 88 cents a share.  
 Yesterday, Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo reported a 3.4
percent drop in second-quarter  profit  on costs to integrate its
largest bottlers. Coca-Cola has said it plans to finish its
purchase of the North American assets of its largest bottler in
October, aiming to improve beverage profit and distribution.
