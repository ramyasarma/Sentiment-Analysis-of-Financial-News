             Macquarie Group Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest investment bank, is seeking offers of about $3.5 billion
for Spirit Finance Corp. in what could be the largest sale of a
U.S. real estate investment trust in more than three years, said
three people with knowledge of the talks.  
 At least three publicly traded REITs, including National
Retail Properties, Lexington Realty Trust and Realty Income
Corp., have been approached in recent weeks and are studying
potential offers, said two of these people, who declined to be
identified because the process isn’t public. Private-equity
firms have also expressed interest in Spirit, the people said.  
 A deal for more than $3.5 billion would be the biggest
takeover of a U.S. REIT since the $22 billion buyout of
Archstone-Smith Trust by Tishman Speyer Properties LP and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. announced in May 2007, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Barclays Capital is helping sell Spirit, the
people said.  
 “REITs and private-equity firms would have a lot of
interest in a company like Spirit because their tenant quality
makes cash flows predictable in an uncertain market,” said  Ben Thypin , an analyst at Real Capital Analytics Inc. in New York.
The sale may give buyout firms “confidence that they can unload
their boom-era investments.”  
 Paula Hannaford , a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Macquarie,
declined to comment. Spokespeople for National Retail and
Lexington Retail didn’t return calls seeking comment.
Spokeswomen for Realty Income and Barclays declined to comment.  
 REIT Buyouts  
 Macquarie  today fell 1.2 percent to A$38.50 in Sydney
trading at the 4:10 p.m. close, extending this year’s decline to
20 percent. The benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  dropped 0.9 percent
and has lost 10 percent this year.  
 Leveraged buyouts of REITs totaled $92 billion from 2005 to
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A successful sale
of Spirit may signal to buyout firms that they may now be able
to sell some of the properties. Since 2007, private equity firms
have spent just $2.2 billion buying REITs.  
 Spirit, which owns or finances almost 1,200 retail
properties in 45 states, focuses on sale-leasebacks with single
tenant properties such as auto dealers, drug stores,
supermarkets and movie theaters, according to Moody’s Investors
Service.  
 The Scottsdale, Arizona-based REIT’s balance sheet at the
end of 2009 listed assets of $3.5 billion and debt of $2.9
billion, according to Standard & Poor’s. REITs in the U.S. must
distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income to
shareholders, and don’t pay corporate taxes on that amount.  
 A group led by Sydney-based Macquarie that included
Icelandic lender Kaupthing Bank hf agreed to acquire Spirit in
March 2007 in a deal valued at $3.5 billion, including
approximately $1.9 billion of assumed debt, according to a press
release at the time.
