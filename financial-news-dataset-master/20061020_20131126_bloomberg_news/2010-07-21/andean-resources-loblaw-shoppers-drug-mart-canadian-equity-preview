             Canadian stocks  rose as commodity
producers and financial shares rallied after U.S. companies
including AT&T Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. reported
earnings that topped analyst estimates and metals gained.  
 Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, advanced 4.5 percent as the percentage of S&P 500
companies beating analyst estimates this season climbed to 85
percent. Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas
company, increased 2.7 percent as the fuels rallied at least 2.3
percent each. Canadian National Railway Co., the country’s
largest railroad, gained 2.8 percent after U.S. carrier Union
Pacific Corp. announced its quarterly results.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 154.43
points, or 1.3 percent, to 11,667.76 at 4:10 p.m. in Toronto.  
 “We’ve had some big companies today that are really good
indicators of the economy beat expectations,” said  Jeff Bradacs , senior investment analyst on a team that manages about
C$750 million ($722 million) for MFC Global Investment
Management in Toronto. “It’s the commodity prices, in reaction
to the earnings, driving our market in Canada.”  
 The S&P/TSX had slipped 0.5 percent from July 12 to
yesterday as a decline in U.S. consumer confidence and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s warnings of an “unusually
uncertain” economic outlook had overshadowed corporate profits.
Canadian companies including CN Railway, Rogers Communications
Inc., Teck and GoldCorp Inc. are scheduled to report financial
results over the next week.  
 Caterpillar  
 Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, announced  second-quarter profit  that surpassed the
average analyst estimate by 30 percent, excluding certain items,
and increased its earnings forecast for the year. Xerox Inc.,
the largest maker of high-speed color printers, topped earnings
estimates by 15 percent and also raised its 2010 profit
projection.  
 Commodities also surged after the U.K. reported a bigger
gain in retail sales than most economists forecast, while a
measure of  German manufacturing  unexpectedly gained.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index advanced 2
percent to the highest level since May 5. Crude oil increased
3.6 percent, the most since May 27, in New York, while natural
gas rallied 2.3 percent.  
 Suncor climbed 2.7 percent to C$33.41. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest energy company by
market value, rose 1.8 percent to C$36.57. TransCanada Corp.,
the owner of Canada’s  largest pipeline system , increased for a
sixth day, gaining 1 percent to C$36.75.  
 The six major base metals traded on the London Metal
Exchange advanced, and copper climbed to the highest price in
almost 10 weeks.  
 Mining Companies  
 Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, increased 3.6 percent to C$36.42. Copper producer
Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. jumped 10 percent to C$11.92 to  lead the
S&P/TSX .  
 The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  rebounded from a two-week low,
with the country’s eight publicly traded banks and three largest
insurers advancing.  
 Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has 1,042 branches in the
U.S., rose 0.9 percent to C$71.15. Manulife, which got  54
percent  of its revenue from the U.S. last year, rallied 4.5
percent from a 16-month low to C$15.29. Sun Life Financial Inc.,
Canada’s third-largest insurer, gained 4.5 percent to C$27.38 to
end a four-day streak of losses.  
 Railroads  
 CN Railway advanced 2.8 percent to C$63.70 after Union
Pacific, the largest North American railroad, reported second-

percent. After the close of trading, CN reported second-quarter
profit excluding some items that beat the average estimate by 13

 Kinross Gold Corp., Canada’s third-largest gold producer,
increased 3.7 percent to C$16.99 after TD analyst  Greg Barnes 
raised his rating on the company to “buy” from “hold.”
Barnes cited TD’s increased gold price forecast of $1,300 an
ounce for next year and $1,400 for 2012.  
 Panelboard producer Norbord Inc. soared 9.9 percent to
C$12.64, after its second-quarter profit exceeded the average of
10 analyst estimates by 67 percent, excluding certain items. The
company’s net income of $37 million marked its  first profit 
since 2006. The shares climbed as much as 12 percent, the most
