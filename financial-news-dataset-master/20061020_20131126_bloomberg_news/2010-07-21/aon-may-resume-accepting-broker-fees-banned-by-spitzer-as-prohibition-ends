             Aon Corp. , the world’s biggest
insurance broker, said it may resume taking payments that were
banned for five years under a 2005 settlement with  Eliot Spitzer , then the attorney general of New York.  
 Aon,  Marsh & McLennan Cos.  and Willis Group Holdings Plc,
the three biggest brokers, were released in February from
restrictions on accepting contingent commissions, the once-
secret payments from insurers that had prompted Spitzer’s bid-
rigging probes. The companies had resolved Spitzer’s allegations
of fraud and anticompetitive practices in the placing of
insurance policies by agreeing to pay more than $1 billion.  
 “We have decided to accept various forms of compensation
available, which may include supplemental and/or contingent
commissions,” said  Steve McGill , chief executive officer of Aon
Risk Solutions, a division of the Chicago-based company, in a
statement today. In February, Aon spokesman  David Prosperi  said
the Chicago-based broker had no plans to resume taking
contingent commissions.  
 Aon gained 19 cents to $36.18 at 9:59 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Marsh & McLennan slipped 5
cents to $22.76. Willis dropped 14 cents to $31.66.  
 Aon and New York-based Marsh & McLennan appealed to
officials for redress in 2008 as regulators opened a review.
Marsh & McLennan, which was the No. 1 broker at the time of
Spitzer’s probes, said in 2004 that the payments totaled about
$845 million a year, or 12 percent of brokerage revenue. London-
based Willis said it won’t take contingents.  Christine Walton , a
spokeswoman for Marsh & McLennan, didn’t immediately return a
message seeking comment.  
 ‘Cartel Behavior’  
 Brokers are hired by insurance buyers to pick companies to
provide cover against property damage or liabilities. Contingent
commissions, which insurers pay to entice brokers, vary in
amount based on the quantity of coverage sold by the middleman
and how profitable the policies turn out to be for carriers.
Spitzer, who conducted the probes and imposed the restrictions,
called some contingent commissions “classic cartel behavior.”  
 In the settlements, Aon agreed to pay $190 million and
Marsh & McLennan agreed to pay $850 million. No. 3 Willis agreed
to pay $50 million.
