             Copper prices may rise to $7,206.75
a metric ton after the metal formed a “head-and-shoulders”
pattern, according to technical analysis by Standard Chartered
Plc.  
 The attached chart shows a trend line in red tracing the
head-and-shoulders and a separate short-term trend line in green
that’s forming a triangle. An increase above the head-and-
shoulders trend line may push prices to a May 28 high of $7,043
a ton and then to the May 10 high of $7,206.75, said  Dan Smith ,
an analyst at Standard Chartered in London.  
 After breaking these two levels “we are off to the races
and prices could go even higher,” Smith said yesterday by
phone. “We have gone down and we are going to go in the other
direction, which means trending higher,” he said.  
 Copper for delivery in three months traded at $6,729 a ton
at 9:53 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. The price has dropped
8.8 percent this year on the LME, pulled down by a stronger
dollar and concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis may
hamper economies and crimp usage of metals. Gains by the dollar
make metals priced in the currency more expensive in terms of
other monies.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The head-and-shoulders pattern
occurs when prices form consecutive troughs, with the middle
trough being either higher or lower than the other two.
