             Rookie free-agent point guard Jeremy
Lin, who played four seasons at Harvard University, will sign
with the Golden State Warriors, a spokesman for the National
Basketball Association team said.  
 “We anticipate signing him later today,” Warriors
spokesman  Raymond Ridder  said in an e-mail.  
 Lin, from Palo Alto, California, averaged 16.4 points and
4.4 assists per game as a senior for the Crimson.  
 Helped by his play as a member of the Dallas Mavericks’
NBA’s summer league squad, the Warriors offered to guarantee
more than half of Lin’s potential first-year salary of almost
$500,000, ESPN  reported .  
 As a senior, Lin was named a unanimous first-team Ivy
League selection. He was a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award,
which goes to the nation’s top point guard, and the John R.
Wooden Award, given to the national player of the year.
