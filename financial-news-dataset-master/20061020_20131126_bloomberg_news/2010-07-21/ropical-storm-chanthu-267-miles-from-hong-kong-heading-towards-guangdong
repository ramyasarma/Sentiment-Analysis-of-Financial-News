             Chanthu intensified to a typhoon as
it churned toward south China, with Hong Kong maintaining a No.
3 strong wind signal today as the storm moves past.  
 The Hong Kong Observatory upgraded Chanthu to typhoon from
severe tropical storm at 4 a.m. local time, senior scientific
officer Mok Hing-yim said by telephone.  
 Chanthu was about 340 kilometers (211 miles) southwest of
Hong Kong at 8 a.m. local time and is forecast to move at 14
kilometers per hour toward the western coast of Guangdong
province, the Observatory  said . The storm was packing sustained
winds of 120 kilometers per hour near its center, Mok said.  
 “Chanthu will maintain a similar distance from Hong Kong
for the next couple of hours. Hong Kong will still be affected
by strong winds and Chanthu’s outer rain bands,” Mok said. The
strong wind signal No. 3 will remain in force for some time.”  
 China raised its alert on tropical storm Chanthu to typhoon
level yesterday and the National Meteorological Center said it
may make landfall in southern China today, bringing heavy rains
to Guangdong and Hainan provinces.
