             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts rose from a six-week low as economists
forecast policy makers will lift the country’s benchmark
interest rate 75 basis points to slow growth to a level that
won’t stoke a resurgence of inflation.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 10.99 percent at 9:30 a.m. New York time. Yesterday
the yield closed at 10.97 percent, the lowest since June 7.  
 “The rise is a function of the fact that we’re going to
get a 75-basis-point hike today,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an
emerging-markets economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Miami.
“Despite softer inflation and souring growth, the overall
growth outlook and inflation risk assessment remains firm, and
warrants a 75-basis-point hike.”  
 Of the 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 46 expect
Brazil’s central bank to raise the overnight rate to 11 percent
from 10.25 percent. Economists at Squanto Investimentos Ltda,
Opus Gestao de Recursos and Banco Bradesco SA forecast a 50-
basis-point increase.  
 The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.7718 per dollar,
from 1.7742 yesterday.
