             South Korean shipyards may rise
after  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.  reported better-than-expected
profit and  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.  won its
first container-ship order in two years.  
 Hyundai Heavy, the world’s largest shipyard, more than
doubled second-quarter  net income  to 910.5 billion won ($757
million) after completing more offshore units and paying less
for raw materials, it said late yesterday. Daewoo, the second-
biggest yard, announced a contract for 10 container ships worth
$975 million from an unidentified customer.  
 The Daewoo order, following a similar-sized deal for third-
ranked  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. , may spur optimism among
investors about the outlook for ship contracts, said  J.D. Yang ,
an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.
Shipping lines slashed orders for new vessels last year as the
global recession hammered trade.  
 “Orders in the second half could be higher than what
people are expecting,” Yang said. “This year is also going to
be Hyundai Heavy’s best ever for earnings given the size of its
orderbook.”  
 Hyundai Heavy secured $9.99 billion of orders in the first
half, about triple the tally a year earlier, as economic growth
and depleting reserves spurred oil companies to order new
offshore drilling and production platforms. The Ulsan, South
Korea-based  shipyard  expects full-year offshore orders to
surpass ship contracts for the first time in nine years.  
 First-half orders for offshore structures jumped to $2.66
billion from $179 million a year earlier. Ship orders rose to
$1.64 billion from $4 million, the company said yesterday.  
 Steel Costs  
 Operating  margin , or operating profit income as a
percentage of sales, widened to 14 percent from 10 percent. The
company paid less for steel plate after mills including Posco,
South Korea’s largest steelmaker, cut prices because of slowing
demand amid the global recession.  
 The  shipyard  gained 3.9 percent to close at 256,500 won in
Seoul yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The stock has
advanced 48 percent this year, the  second-best performer  among
50 top companies traded on South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index.  
 Daewoo  rose 1.6 percent to close at 19,700 won in Seoul
trading before its order announcement. The stock has advanced 13
percent this year.  
 Daewoo will deliver the ships, each able to carry as many
as 8,400 20-foot containers, by the first quarter of 2014, it
said yesterday. The shipyard has won orders for vessels and
offshore projects worth $4.9 billion this year, achieving 70
percent of its $7 billion target.  
 Samsung Heavy announced a $1 billion order for 10 container
ships from Taiwan-based Evergreen Group earlier this month.  
 Hyundai Heavy aims to win $17.7 billion of contracts this
year, compared with $10.7 billion in 2009. That includes
boosting ship orders to $4.03 billion from $444 million,
according to a company forecast in December. Orders for offshore
projects may increase 79 percent to $4.2 billion, it said.
