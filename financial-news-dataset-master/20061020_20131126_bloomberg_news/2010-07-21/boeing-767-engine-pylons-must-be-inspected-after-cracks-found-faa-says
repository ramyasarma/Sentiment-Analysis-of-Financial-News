             U.S. aviation regulators ordered
inspections of 138  Boeing Co.  767 aircraft pylons that attach
the engines to the wings to reduce the threat of cracking.  
 Inspections must be conducted after 8,000 flights rather
than 10,000 as now required, and the examinations must be done
within 400 flights, or 90 days, whichever occurs later, the
Federal Aviation Administration said today in a statement.  
 Boeing, based in Chicago, said last month it was
recommending more frequent pylon inspections after mechanics at
AMR Corp.’s American Airlines discovered cracks on one jet.
Pylon failure could cause an engine to fall from the wing where
it is attached.  
 As part of its  order , the FAA is requiring checks of pylon
fittings after 400 flights instead of 1,500. The inspections
will cost carriers about $47,000, according to the FAA.  
 Three decades ago, damage to an engine pylon as it was
reattached to a plane at American’s Tulsa, Oklahoma, maintenance
facility contributed to the  crash  of an American DC-10 in
Chicago on May 25, 1979, the National Transportation Safety
Board determined.  
 The crash occurred shortly after takeoff, killing all 271
onboard and two on the ground. Sections of an engine pylon came
off the plane, allowing the left engine to fall off, cutting
critical control lines and causing the DC-10 to roll on its back
before hitting the ground.
