             Orange-juice output in the U.S., the
world’s second-largest producer, will fall more than the
government forecast in January, the Department of Agriculture
said.  
 Output will drop to 603,000 metric tons in the 12 months
ending Sept. 30 from a revised 755,000 tons a year earlier, the
agency said today in a  report  on its website. On Jan. 28, the
government forecast 615,000 tons this year.  
 Global output will be 2.174 million tons with Brazil, the
biggest producer, at 1.33 million tons. In January, the USDA
forecast 2.168 million for the world and 1.305 million for
Brazil.  
 Last year, worldwide production was 2.284 million tons and
Brazil’s output was 1.28 million.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.55
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.434 a pound today on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Prices have climbed 40 percent in the past
year on forecasts for lower Florida production.
