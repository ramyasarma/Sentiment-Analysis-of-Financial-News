             U.S. stocks dropped and Treasuries
rallied after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain” even as the
central bank prepares to eventually raise interest rates.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
1,079.82 at 2:04 p.m. in New York after fluctuating between
gains and losses earlier. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note
slid three basis points to 2.92 percent and the two-year yield
sank to a record low for the fourth time in five days.   
 Bernanke said central bankers “remain prepared” to act as
needed to aid growth even as they get ready to eventually raise
interest rates from almost zero and shrink a record balance
sheet.  
 While Fed officials plan for the exit, “we also recognize
that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain,” Bernanke
said today in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. “We
will continue to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic
developments, and we remain prepared to take further policy
actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our
nation’s productive potential in a context of price stability.”  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 1.2 percent after Fiat
SpA returned to a profit and Reckitt Benckiser Plc agreed to buy
SSL International Plc. for $3.9 billion, bringing total deals in
Europe to $368 billion this year, 6.8 percent more than the same
period in 2009. Global takeovers have reached $1 trillion so far
in 2010, 6.5 percent more than at the same time last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.2 percent and the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose for a second day, climbing 1.3
percent. Benchmark indexes in Russia and Turkey advanced at
least 2 percent to lead gains among major developing-nation
equity gauges, while benchmark indexes in Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary and South Africa also increased more than 1.5
percent.  
 The yen appreciated against 14 of 16 major counterparts,
rising 0.3 percent against the dollar and climbing 0.8 percent
versus the euro. The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the euro,
which traded at $1.2821.  
 German 10-year bonds were little changed, with the yield at
2.64 percent, after the government failed to sell all of the 4
billion euros of 30-year securities it offered. Portugal
borrowing costs rose at an auction of an auction of 1.253
billion euros of bills due in July 2011. Still, the nation’s 10-
year bond yield lost one basis point to 5.42 percent.
