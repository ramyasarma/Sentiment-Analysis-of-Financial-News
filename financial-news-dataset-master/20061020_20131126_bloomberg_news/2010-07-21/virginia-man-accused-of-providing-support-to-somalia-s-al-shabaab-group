             A Fairfax County, Virginia, man was
arrested on charges he provided support for Somalia’s Islamist
al-Shabaab, which has been designated by the U.S. as a foreign
terrorist organization.  
 Zachary Adam Chesser, 20, told federal agents that he twice
attempted to travel to Somalia to join the group that the U.S.
claims has links to al-Qaeda. Chesser was turned away from a
July 10 flight out of New York’s  John F. Kennedy International
Airport  after he was informed he was on a “no-fly” list.  
 Al-Shabaab last week claimed responsibility for two bomb
attacks that killed at least 74 people in Kampala, the capital
of Uganda, as crowds watched the final game of the World Cup.  
 When Chesser was turned away from the flight, he told U.S.
agents that he intended to travel to Somalia from Uganda. He
attempted to bring his infant son to provide “cover,”
prosecutors said.  
 “This case exposes the disturbing reality that extreme
radicalization can happen anywhere, including Northern
Virginia,”  Neil MacBride , the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern
District of Virginia, said in a statement.
