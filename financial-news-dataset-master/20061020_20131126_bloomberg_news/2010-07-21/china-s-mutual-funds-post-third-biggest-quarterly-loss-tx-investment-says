             China’s mutual funds posted their
third-biggest quarterly loss as the nation’s stock market
slumped the most in Asia,  TX Investment Consulting Co.  said.  
 The country’s 652 funds had a combined loss of 351.4
billion yuan ($51.8 billion) in second quarter, the investment
consulting firm said on its website today. The funds lost 668.8
billion yuan in the first quarter of 2008 and 413.9 billion yuan
for the following three months, it said.  
 China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  slid 23 percent
in three months through June, its biggest quarterly decline
since March 2008, after the government intensified measures to
curb inflation and housing speculation, and on concern Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis would damp demand for overseas shipments.
The drop was the most among 93 benchmark indexes worldwide after
Greece, Cyprus and Kazakhstan.  
 TX Investment said 366 funds reduced their stock positions
by 8.7 percentage points from the first quarter to 73.25
percent. All of China’s 60 asset management firms sold more
shares than they bought, cutting equity positions by an average
10.23 percentage points in the second quarter, said  Howbuy ,
which compiles and provides data on mutual funds, in its
quarterly fund report.  
 Huashang Fund Management Co. and Soochow Asset Management
Co. ranked first and second in terms of returns in the second
quarter according to Howbuy, lost at least 6.3 percent.
