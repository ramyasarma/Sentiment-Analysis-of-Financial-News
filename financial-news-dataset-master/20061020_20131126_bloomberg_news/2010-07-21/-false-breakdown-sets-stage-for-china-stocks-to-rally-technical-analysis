             The  Shanghai Composite Index ’s
“false breakdown” below 2,500 sets the stage for a rally that
may take the measure past the 50-day moving average for the
first time in three months to 2,720, said Auerbach Grayson & Co.  
 China’s stocks rallied yesterday, sending the benchmark
index above 2,500 for the first time since June 28, as the
prospect the government may relax its policy tightening measures
spurred gains for the nation’s banks and property companies. The
Shanghai Composite surged 2.2 percent to 2,528.73 yesterday for
a two-day advance of 4.3 percent, the most since May.  
 “The Shanghai Composite is displaying some very nice price
action and the inertia generated by the ‘false breakdown’ below
2,500 has potentially set the stage for a meaningful reversal in
trend,”  Richard Ross , global technical strategist at Auerbach
Grayson in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “A move above
the 50-day moving average could provide the catalyst for a test
of our initial upside target of 2,720.”  
 The Shanghai Composite is  0.6 percent away  from reclaiming
the 50-day moving average after breaking below that level on
April 19. The index has declined 23 percent this year, the worst
performance among benchmark Asian gauges, on concern measures by
the government to control real-estate speculation and rising
consumer prices will damp economic growth.  
 China’s stocks probably ended a slump after reaching a low
earlier this month, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets said yesterday.  
 Technical analysts track price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. The
trading patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
