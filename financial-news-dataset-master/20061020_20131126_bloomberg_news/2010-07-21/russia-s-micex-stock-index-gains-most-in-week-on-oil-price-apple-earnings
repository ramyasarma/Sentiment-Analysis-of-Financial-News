             Russian stocks gained the most in
two weeks as oil traded above $78 a barrel and after Apple Inc.
reported better-than-estimated earnings.  
 OAO Lukoil , the country’s second-biggest oil producer,
increased 2.9 percent.  OAO Severstal , the nation’s largest
steelmaker, added 5.5 percent, while gas export monopoly  OAO
Gazprom  rose 2 percent. The  Micex Index  of 30 stocks climbed 2
percent, the biggest gain since July 6, to close at 1,354.84 at
6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  
 Crude advanced as much as 1.5 percent to $78.57 a barrel in
New York before declining to $77.11 by the close of equities
trading on the Micex. Apple’s net income increased to $3.51 a
share, compared with the $3.11 forecast by analysts, while the
Commerce Department reported yesterday that building permits in
the U.S. increased for the first time since March, easing
concerns that the global economic recovery may falter.  
 “The Russian market is catching up on the higher oil price
and the good Apple numbers yesterday,”  Tom Mundy , a strategist
at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said by phone.  
 Copper climbed 2.6 percent to $6,813 a metric ton on the
London Metals Exchange.  OAO GMKN Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s
largest miner, advanced 1.1 percent to 4,886.03 rubles.  
 OAO RusHydro  declined as much as 2 percent after Russia’s
largest hydropower company halted its Baksanskaya plant in the
North Caucasus following an attack on the facility that left two
people dead. The shares closed up 0.3 percent at 1.589 rubles.
