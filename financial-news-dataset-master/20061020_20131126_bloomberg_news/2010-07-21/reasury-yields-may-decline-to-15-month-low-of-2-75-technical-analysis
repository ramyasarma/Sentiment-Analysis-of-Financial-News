             Treasury 10-year yields may decline
to a 15-month low of 2.75 percent if they break below a key
technical level,  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  said, citing
trading patterns.  
 The  yield  on the benchmark note dropped to 2.88 percent on
July 1, the lowest since April 2009, before climbing to 3.13
percent on July 14. The rate then slid back to 2.89 percent on
July 20, forming a so-called double bottom.  
 “If the 10-year yield falls through the double bottom
formed near 3 percent, it may then extend declines to as low as
2.75 percent,” said  Kazuaki Oh’e , executive director of fixed
income, currencies and distribution at Canada’s fifth-largest
lender in Tokyo.  
 The 3.5 percent note due May 2020 yielded 2.94 percent as
of 9:01 a.m. in Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The last time the yield was at 2.75 percent was April 15, 2009.  
 A double bottom forms when a currency makes two consecutive
troughs of about the same depth, and usually indicates it is
poised to rebound.  
 Oh’e said the yield may accelerate declines if Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress this
week and the U.S. jobs report for July boost speculation the
central bank will increase measures to keep borrowing costs low.  
 “The yield may fall below 2.75 percent, with 2.5 percent
coming in sight as the next target,” he said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.
