             Investors will make money based on
their ability to anticipate extreme events after the end of the
period of stability known as the “Great Moderation,” said
 Richard Clarida  of Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 The Great Moderation, an era from 1987 to 2007 of
“predictable policy, low inflation, and modest business
cycles,” allowed investors to make money using debt to magnify
profits on bets that actual outcomes would match the average of
a range of possibilities, Clarida wrote in an article today on
the  Web site  of Pimco, which manages $1.1 trillion.  
 “We are in a New Normal world in which the distribution of
outcomes is flatter and the tails are fatter,” said Clarida,
global strategic adviser for Newport Beach, California-based
Pimco. “Investors had 25 years to get comfortable with the
Great Moderation. The sooner they recognize those days are over,
the better.”  
 The financial crisis and its aftermath mean historical
correlations are probably irrelevant or misleading, Clarida
said. Investors have less confidence the distribution of events
they anticipate is correct. With more returns or losses tied to
extreme events and less on the average, money managers will
probably adjust their portfolios more often, creating “risk-
on” and “risk-off” trading days, he said.  
 Pimco’s $234 billion Total Return Fund, the world’s largest
mutual fund, handed investors a 13 percent gain in the past
year, beating 62 percent of its competitors, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco is a unit of Munich-based insurer
Allianz SE.
