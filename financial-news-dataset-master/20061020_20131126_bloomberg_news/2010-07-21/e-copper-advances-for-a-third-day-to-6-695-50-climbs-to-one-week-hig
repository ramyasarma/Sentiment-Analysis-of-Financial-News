             Copper gained for a third day in
Asia after an increase in building permits in the U.S., the
second-largest user, boosted demand prospects.  
 The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.8 percent to $6,695.50 a metric ton,
the highest level since July 15, before trading at $6,687 a ton
by 8:04 a.m. in Singapore.
