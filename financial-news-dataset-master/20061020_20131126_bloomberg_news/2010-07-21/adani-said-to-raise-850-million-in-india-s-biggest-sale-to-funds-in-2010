             Adani Enterprises Ltd. , controlled
by billionaire  Gautam Adani , raised $850 million in the largest
share sale to institutional investors by an Indian company this
year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Adani raised the maximum sought after investors ordered
about $1.2 billion of stock, according to the people, who
declined to be named before an official announcement. Bank of
America Corp., IDFC Capital Ltd., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc.,
UBS AG, Enam Securities Pvt., ICICI Securities Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital Co. managed the offering, according to a sale
document yesterday.  
 The Indian company, which is building power plants to tap
rising demand in Asia’s third-largest economy, is in advanced
talks with Linc Energy Ltd. to  acquire  coking coal assets in
Australia, the Brisbane-based company said this month. Adani and
rivals are luring investors as India plans to increase spending
on roads, ports and power by 24 percent this fiscal year.  
 “Infrastructure companies are now again coming into the
spotlight,”  Prateek Agrawal , head of equities at Bharti Axa
Investment Managers Pvt., said by telephone today in Mumbai.
“These are the guys that will benefit from the expected capital
expenditure by Indian companies in the second half to drive
growth.”  
 Shares of Adani, which has coal mining and trading, power
generation, oil and gas exploration and gas distribution
operations, climbed 1.5 percent to 552 rupees as of 11:04 a.m.
in Mumbai trading.  The stock  has rallied 27 percent this year,
compared with a 2.8 percent advance in the MSCI India Index.  
 Terms of Sale  
 The shares were sold at 536.15 rupees apiece, according to
one of the people. That represents a discount of 1.4 percent to
the stock’s closing price yesterday of 543.80 rupees. Adani
planned to raise $600 million with an option to increase the
sale to $850 million if there was sufficient demand, according
to the sale document.  
 Devendra Amin , a spokesman at Adani Enterprises, couldn’t
immediately be reached at his office in Ahmedabad. Spokespeople
at the banks didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed queries.  
 The Adani sale helps cement Citigroup’s No. 1 ranking among
banks that have managed share sales in India for a second
consecutive year, according to Bloomberg data. Kotak Mahindra is
ranked second this year, followed by UBS, ICICI, Enam, Morgan
Stanley and Bank of America.  
 Fund-Raising in India  
 Indian companies have raised more than 612 billion rupees
($13 billion) from shares sales this year, putting the market on
course to exceed last year’s 718 billion rupees and 2008’s
record 782 billion rupees, the data show.  
 Adani may buy the Galilee tenement, or permit, valued at
more than A$1 billion ($874 million), Linc Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Bond  said on July 14. The Indian company has said
it will invest the money from the share sale for its coal mining
and oil and gas exploration businesses, and to repay loans.  
 Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Enterprises, was ranked No.
10 among India’s billionaires by Forbes in November, with a net
worth of $6.4 billion, after his wealth climbed more than 60
percent from 2008.
