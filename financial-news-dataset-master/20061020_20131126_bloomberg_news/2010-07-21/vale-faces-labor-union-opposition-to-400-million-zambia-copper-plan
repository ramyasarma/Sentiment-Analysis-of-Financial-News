             Zambia’s main mineworkers union said
it opposes  Vale SA’s  plan to invest $400 million in the
development of a copper mine in a venture with  African Rainbow
Minerals Ltd.  at Konkola North.  
 The Mineworkers Union of Zambia is concerned about the
possible treatment of workers by Vale, Rayford Mbulu, the
union’s president, said in interview from the northern town of
Kitwe today. A Vale spokeswoman declined to comment and said the
investment is yet to be approved by the company’s board. She
declined to be identified in line with company policy.  
 “We have the powers to block any investment from coming
into the country because we are internationally affiliated and
we have information that their record is bad,” Mbulu said,
without giving more detail.  
 The Konkola North mine, located north of the Konkola Deep
mine operated by  Vedanta Resources Plc , will start production in
2013. Initial output is estimated at 50,000 metric tons a year,
which will later be expanded to 100,000 tons. Zambia is Africa’s
biggest copper producer.
