             The Montreal Port Authority said its
grain terminal can receive and ship cargo after it obtained a
court injunction to allow access to the port, according to a
statement issued today.  
 The MPA, which operates its own grain terminal, also said
rail traffic has resumed.  
 The Maritime Employers Association this week imposed a
lockout on about 850 longshoremen and the injunction allows work
unrelated to the labor stoppage to continue, the statement also
said.
