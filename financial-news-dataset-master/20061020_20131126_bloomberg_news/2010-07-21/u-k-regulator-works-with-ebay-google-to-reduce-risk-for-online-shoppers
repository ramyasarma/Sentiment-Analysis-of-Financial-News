             Britain’s antitrust regulator
consulted with  EBay Inc. ,  Google Inc.  and other companies on a
national strategy to increase protection for U.K. shoppers who
spent 38 billion pounds ($57.8 billion) online last year.  
 The proposed plan calls for the  Office of Fair Trading  to
investigate, issue fines and file lawsuits when industry-led
efforts to increase competition and guard consumers from fraud
fail or aren’t in place, the London-based watchdog said in a
statement today.  
 “This strategy will help drive competition and growth by
using more focused methods to protect consumers,” Noah
Curthoys, an OFT director, said in the statement. “This will
ensure the U.K. is one of the global leaders in online
enforcement.”  
 Internet transactions last year comprised 9.5 percent of
the U.K.’s retail sales, more than in any other European
country, the OFT said. Seventy-one percent of U.K retailers use
Internet sales channels compared with an average of 51 percent
in the 27-nation European Union, it said.  
 The government asked for the plan as 6 percent of Internet
users have lost money online due to Internet fraud, the OFT
said.  
 The OFT said it needs feedback from more businesses,
consumers and trade groups before publishing the final proposal
in December. The regulator said it also consulted with  Microsoft
Corp. , Cisco Systems Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.
