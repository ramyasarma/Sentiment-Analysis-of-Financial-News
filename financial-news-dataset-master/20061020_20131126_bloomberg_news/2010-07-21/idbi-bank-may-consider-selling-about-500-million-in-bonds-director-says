             IDBI Bank Ltd., an Indian state-
owned lender, is considering a sale of bonds denominated in U.S.
dollars to raise about $500 million, Executive Director Melwyn
Rego said in an interview today.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc have been hired to
oversee the bank’s medium-term note program, Rego said by
telephone today from Mumbai. BNP Paribas SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc will help manage
this sale of benchmark  notes , to be done through its Dubai
branch, he said.  
 The sale would be the first since the Mumbai-based lender,
known then as Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd., set up
a $1.5 billion medium-term bonds program in November 2007. The
company changed its name in May 2008. Benchmark typically means
at least $500 million.  
 The bonds may have a maturity of five to five-and-a-half
years, said Rego, who oversees the lender’s international
operations. The company is likely to make a decision on the sale
after talking to investors next week, he said.  
 Spokespeople at the respective investment banks didn’t
immediately respond to e-mailed queries.
