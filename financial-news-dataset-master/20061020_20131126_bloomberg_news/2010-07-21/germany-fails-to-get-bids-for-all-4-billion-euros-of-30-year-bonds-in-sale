             Germany failed to attract bids for
all of the 4 billion euros ($5.13 billion) it offered of new 30-
year bonds as investors balked at yields near the lowest since
the aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 collapse.  
 Bids for the 3.25 percent security due in July 2042 were
3.764 billion euros, data from the Federal Finance Agency showed
today. The Bundesbank retained 805 million euros, the data
showed. The sale received bids for 1.2 times the securities
offered when the central bank’s participation was taken into
account. Without that involvement, the bid-to-cover ratio would
have been 0.94. Bunds stayed lower following the auction.  
 “This is a bit bad, rather than very bad, as the retained
share will be going to the market later on,” said  Marius Daheim , a senior fixed-income strategist at Bayerische
Landesbank in Munich. “It has not failed for reasons of
creditworthiness like Greece, but because yields are extremely
low and anyone who buys it will probably have to take a loss not
far down the road.”  
 The yield on the 30-year bond rose two basis points to 3.35
percent as of 2:15 p.m. in London. The debt agency said it sold
the securities today at an average yield of 3.33 percent.  
 ‘Lowest Average Yield’  
 “It is important in considering today’s results to
remember that at present we have an extremely low yield level,”
 Joerg Mueller , a spokesman for the agency, said in an e-mail. It
“is the lowest average yield level that we have ever had for a
bond of this maturity,” he said. “With regards to the under-
subscription, the Finance Agency sees no fundamental problem.”  
 Yields on German bonds have declined as the European debt
crisis drove investors to the safety of the euro-region’s
benchmark government securities. The 30-year bond yield fell to
3.09 percent on Dec. 4, 2008, the lowest since at least 1994,
less than three months after the Lehman bankruptcy.  
 “The Bundesbank won’t say the auction failed, but by
everyone else’s definition, it did,” said  Peter Chatwell , an
interest-rate strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “There has been a flight back into
the higher yielders. New 30-year paper with a 3.25 percent
coupon is hard to consider taking down for a long-term
investment.”  
 At the previous auction of 30-year securities on April 21,
investors bid for 2.752 billion euros of the 3 billion euros of
the debt.  
 Germany has received bids for less than the securities
offered at 30-year bond sales on four occasions during the past
four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The finance
agency got 3.94 billion euros of bids at a 4 billion-euro sale
in July 2008, and 5.89 billion euros of bids at a 6 billion-euro
auction in January 2007.  
 Under the German auction system, the Bundesbank retains
notes and bonds at sales for the secondary market.
