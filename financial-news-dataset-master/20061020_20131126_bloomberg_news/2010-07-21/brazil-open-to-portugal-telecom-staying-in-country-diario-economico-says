             The Brazilian government is open to
the idea of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA continuing to be active in
the Latin American country, Diario Economico reported, citing an
unidentified person in the Portuguese government.  
 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates wants Portugal
Telecom to remain in Brazil, the Portuguese newspaper said.  
 Lisbon-based Portugal Telecom yesterday said it hasn’t
signed any pre-agreement or agreement with the objective of
acquiring a stake in Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA of
Brazil, known as Oi. The Portuguese government on June 30
blocked Telefonica SA’s 7.15 billion-euro offer for Portugal
Telecom’s stake in a venture that controls Vivo Participacoes
SA, Brazil’s largest wireless operator.
