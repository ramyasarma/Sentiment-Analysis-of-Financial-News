             Deutsche Bank AG  may report second-
quarter net income of about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion),
missing analysts’ estimates of 1.12 billion euros, because of a
slowdown in investment banking, German newsletter  Platow Brief 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Deutsche Bank spokesman  Armin Niedermeier  declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Germany’s biggest bank
is scheduled to report earnings on July 27.
