             For-profit education stocks  fell in
the U.S. amid speculation a six-day rally had driven the shares
too high given prospects for industry regulation from President
 Barack Obama .  
 Education Management Corp.  and DeVry Inc. helped send an
 index  of 12 education stocks to a 3.4 percent loss at 4 p.m. New
York time after research firm Height Analytics LLC said
“critical” details of the Obama administration’s plans are
unresolved.  
 The U.S. government is reviewing a proposed rule that would
disqualify for-profit colleges from receiving federal aid if
their graduates spend more than 8 percent of their starting
salaries repaying student loans. The Education Department
planned to give an update on the rule, known as gainful
employment, by August, the agency said last month.  
 “The risk in the short-term resides in an inclination to
draw too broad a conclusion given that critical details remain
elusive,” Washington-based Height Analytics analysts  Jarrel Price  and  Andrew Parmentier  wrote in a note today. “That said,
we believe the discussed changes to gainful employment are a
directional positive given that the Education Department is
taking steps to reduce the immediate dislocation of students at
for-profit schools.”  
 The index tracking the industry had  rallied  9 percent,
rising every day between July 12 and yesterday, amid speculation
the government may raise the proposed gainful-employment
threshold to 12 percent from 8 percent, according to Height
Analytics.  
 Education Management dropped 5.8 percent to $16.72 today.
DeVry lost 4.4 percent to $51.26.  Corinthian Colleges Inc. 
declined 4.6 percent to $10. Bridgepoint Education Inc. fell 5.6
percent to $16.62. Apollo Group Inc., owner of the biggest for-
profit university in the U.S., retreated 2 percent to $47.10.  
 Career Education Corp. decreased 5.3 percent to $24.65.
Capella Education Co. fell 2.1 percent to $85.21. Grand Canyon
Education Inc. slipped 1.8 percent to $21.34.  ITT Educational
Services Inc.  slumped 1.8 percent to $88.66.
