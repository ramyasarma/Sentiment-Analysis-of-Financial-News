             Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to Chicago
futures as buyers retreated after prices rose. Corn premiums
were unchanged.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
July shrank to 88 cents to 94 cents a bushel above August
futures from 88 cents to 95 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium was unchanged at 35
cents above September futures. The  spot  premium for corn
declined yesterday to the lowest level since March 23.  
 With this year’s soybean harvest a month away in the U.S.
South, cash grain dealers are “doing a delicate dance to make
sure that they don’t buy a lot of high-priced old crop,” said
 Charles Sernatinger , a vice president for ABN Amro Clearing LLC
in Chicago. “Export demand for corn is routine.”  
 Soybean futures for August delivery gained 3.5 cents to
$10.1525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price on
July 16 touched $10.27, the highest level for the contract since
Jan. 8. Futures have risen 9 percent this month.  
 Corn futures for September delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.7975 a bushel in Chicago, the first increase this
week. The contract is up 4.7 percent this month.  
 Government inspectors examined 6.851 million bushels of
soybeans for export in the week ended July 15, down 51 percent
from a year earlier, the USDA said this week in a report. Corn
inspections fell 4.7 percent.
