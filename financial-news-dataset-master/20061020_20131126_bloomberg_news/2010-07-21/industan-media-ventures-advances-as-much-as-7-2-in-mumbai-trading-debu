             Hindustan Media Ventures Ltd. , an
Indian publisher that sells the Hindi language Hindustan daily,
rose 13.8 percent on its trading debut in Mumbai today.  
 The unit of  HT Media Ltd.  gained to 188.95 rupees at the
close of trading in Mumbai after surging as much as 15.6 percent
earlier to 191.90 rupees. Demand at its initial public offer
earlier this month exceeded the stock on sale by 5.4 times.  
 The company, based in New Delhi, raised 2.7 billion rupees
($57 million) selling 16.27 million shares at 166 rupees apiece
from the sale as it benefited from rising readership and
advertisement spending in an economy the government estimates
will expand 8.5 percent this year.  
 The Hindustan has 9.9 million readers in the Indian states
of Bihar, Jharkhand, the national capital region in and
surrounding New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The
company plans to use the proceeds to set up eight publishing
units aimed at expanding to new areas, according to the offer
document.
