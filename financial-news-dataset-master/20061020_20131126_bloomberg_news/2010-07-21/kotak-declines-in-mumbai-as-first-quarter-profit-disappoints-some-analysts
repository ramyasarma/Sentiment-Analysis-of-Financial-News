             Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. , controlled
by billionaire  Uday Kotak , dropped in Mumbai trading after the
Indian lender reported first-quarter earnings that failed to
meet some analysts’ estimates.  
 Net income  for the three months ended June 30 more than
doubled to 1.87 billion rupees ($40 million), from 903.1 million
rupees, according to a statement sent to the exchanges today.
That compared with the 1.9 billion rupee average of three
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The results were reported on a
standalone basis.  
 Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank  fell as much as 2.1 percent
to 766.1 rupees, its lowest in intraday trading this week, and
was at 766.8 rupees as of 12:08 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock has
fallen 5 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent advance
in the Bombay Stock Exchange Bankex index.  
 “Investors were expecting stronger profit numbers,”
 Deepak Tiwari , an analyst at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities
Pvt., said by telephone today. He has a “hold” rating on the
stock. “The reported profit after tax is 17 percent below our
estimates.”  
 Net interest income, or revenue from lending after payments
to depositors, rose 24 percent to 5.08 billion rupees, as loans
climbed 35 percent from a year earlier to 232 billion rupees as
of June 30, the company said. Fee income climbed 10 percent.
