             Wynn Resorts Ltd. , owner of the Wynn
and Encore casino resorts in Las Vegas and Macau, reported a
wider second-quarter operating loss from its Vegas properties
and said it will issue new notes to repurchase some bonds.  
 The Las Vegas unit’s operating loss of $17.2 million
widened from $8.35 million in the same quarter a year ago,
Wynn’s preliminary results show. Revenue rose 1.7 percent to
$318 million. Cash flow, measured as adjusted property earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fell 14
percent to $65.1 million as the company spent more on benefits,
marketing and maintenance,  Wynn  said today in a statement.  
 Wynn Las Vegas LLC announced a private sale of $1.32
billion of first-mortgage notes due in 2020 at 7.75 percent to
fund a tender offer for 6.625 percent bonds due in 2014, the
company said in separate statements.  
 As Las Vegas, Wynn’s home base, struggles to recover from a
record two-year slump, resort operators in the largest U.S.
casino and conference market have cut room prices, boosted
special offers and increased overseas marketing to attract
gamblers and vacationers. Wynn Las Vegas’s average daily rate
fell 9.6 percent in the second quarter to $197, filling 92.6
percent of rooms compared with 86.6 percent a year ago.  
 Wynn, founded by billionaire Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Wynn , said slot winnings dropped 1.8 percent to
$41.1 million at its Vegas casinos in the quarter. The company
said it won 20 percent of $485.9 million bet on its table games.  
 Baccarat Streak  
 “Recent gaming revenue had been bolstered by an influx of
Asian baccarat players, but that streak, which
disproportionately benefited Wynn, has dried up,”  Janet Brashear , an analyst at Bernstein Research, said today in a
note. “All-in-all, this is not such a disaster.”  
 Wynn Resorts shares fell $1.29, or 1.6 percent, to $81.96
at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has climbed
41 percent this year.  
 The company said it will report its full second-quarter
results on July 29. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected
average profit of 38 cents a share, excluding some items, on
sales of $976.9 million.  
 “Most investors are well aware of the challenges posed by
the Vegas market,”  Steven Wieczynski , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., said today in a note. “Wynn shares are driven
by Macau with Vegas an afterthought.”
