             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars climbed, reversing earlier losses, after data showing
unexpected increases in European manufacturing and services
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 Australia’s currency, known as the Aussie, rose to the
highest level in almost 10 weeks against its U.S. counterpart as
commodities and global stocks advanced. Both South Pacific
currencies earlier declined against the greenback and yen as
confidence gauges in the two countries fell before regulators
release the results of stress tests tomorrow on European banks.  
 “A lot of people are getting out of the flight to
quality,” said  Frank Pavilonis , senior market strategist in
Chicago at Lind-Waldock, the retail arm of futures broker MF
Global Holdings Ltd. “The risk trade is on, the Aussie is up.”  
 Australia’s currency rose 1.8 percent to 77.77 yen at 12:34
p.m. in New York, from 76.43 yesterday. It appreciated 1.7
percent to 89.32 U.S. cents, from 87.81 cents yesterday, after
earlier reaching 89.37, the highest level since May 14.  
 New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 1.7 percent to 63.08 yen,
from 62.02, and fetched 72.48 U.S. cents, from 71.24 cents.  
 A  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area
purchasing managers in services and manufacturing increased to
56.7 from 56 in June, London-based  Markit Economics  said today.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey had projected a drop to 55.5. A
gauge of German manufacturing also unexpectedly rose this month.  
 The  MSCI World Index  of stocks rose 2 percent and the
 Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of raw materials added 1.7 percent.  
 Confidence Gauges  
 Consumer  confidence  in New Zealand fell to 115.6 this month
from 122 in June, according to an index compiled by ANZ National
Bank Ltd. and Roy Morgan Research. The gauge was at its lowest
in almost a year, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Australian business confidence dropped in the second
quarter to 3 points from 17 points in the previous three months,
according to a survey by National Australia Bank Ltd.  
 “The next big event for currency markets is tomorrow’s
European bank stress tests,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency
strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the
nation’s largest lender. “That could potentially be very bad
for the euro. If it’s bad for the euro, it’ll be bad for the
Aussie and kiwi as well.”  
 European Union regulators are examining the strength of 91
banks to determine if they can survive potential losses from
both a recession and a decline in the value of government debt.
