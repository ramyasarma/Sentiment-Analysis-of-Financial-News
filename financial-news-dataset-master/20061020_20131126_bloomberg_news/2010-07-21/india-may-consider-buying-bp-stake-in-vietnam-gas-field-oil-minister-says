             Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , India’s
biggest energy exploration company, may consider bidding jointly
with Vietnam Oil & Gas Group for partner  BP Plc ’s stake in a
natural gas field in Vietnam to secure fuel supplies.  
 The explorer is considering all options and hasn’t taken a
decision on bidding with PetroVietnam, as the company is known,
Chairman  R.S. Sharma  said by telephone from Vietnam today.
Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest state-owned refiner, and
Oil India Ltd. may be brought in as partners, he said.  
 ONGC has a 45 percent stake in the venture operated by BP
and is seeking to boost its share of gas from the field. BP,
which is raising funds to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
agreed July 20 to sell fields in the U.S., Canada and Egypt to
Apache Corp. for $7 billion and plans to dispose of assets in
Pakistan and Vietnam.  
 ONGC  shares gained 0.4 percent to 1,276.75 rupees at 2:53
p.m. in Mumbai trading after declining as much as 1.1 percent.
The  stock  has gained 8 percent this year compared with a 3
percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index .  
 Oil Minister  Murli Deora , who is in Vietnam on an official
visit, said yesterday India would be happy to consider bidding
for the stake that BP may offer. Sharma and  R.S. Butola ,
managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd., the explorer’s overseas
unit, are part of the delegation accompanying Deora, who said he
would discuss the plan with Vietnamese Prime Minister  Nguyen Tan Dung  today.  
 ONGC , based in New Delhi, is spearheading the South Asian
nation’s quest for energy resources overseas, competing with
China for fields from Africa to Venezuela.  
 Oil Spill Fund  
 BP aims to raise about $10 billion selling assets to feed a
$20 billion fund for spill victims demanded by U.S. President
Barack Obama.  
 BP spokesman  David Nicholas  said the company has just
informed the governments of the intention to sell the assets and
won’t comment on estimates of their value or potential buyers.  
 The Nam Con Son gas project in Vietnam is valued at $1.3
billion, the London-based company said on its website. BP’s
assets in Vietnam and Pakistan may be worth $1.7 billion,  Jason Kenney , an analyst at ING Wholesale Banking in Edinburgh, said
by telephone yesterday.  
 BP has a 35 percent share in Block 06.1 off the south
Vietnamese coast, according to ONGC Videsh’s  website . The Indian
company sold shares in the Lan Tay field in Vietnam to BP after
winning the exploration license for the area in 1988.  
 The area started producing gas in January 2003. ONGC’s
share from the project was 1.848 billion cubic meters of gas in
the year ended March 2009, according to the website. ONGC wholly
owns two other offshore blocks in Vietnam, which don’t produce
oil or gas.

                          July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Frederic Neumann, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about India's competition with  China for natural resources.
     Indian Oil Minister Murli Deora traveled to Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela this year, leading a record number of delegations to gain oil for the world’s third-fastest-growing major economy. The flurry of visits is part of a new drive to find oil for India’s 1.2 billion people after losing out to China in at least $12.5 billion of contracts in the past year.
