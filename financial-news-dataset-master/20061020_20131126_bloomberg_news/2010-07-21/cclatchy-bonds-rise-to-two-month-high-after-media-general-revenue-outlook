             Bonds of  McClatchy Co. , publisher of
the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee newspapers, climbed to the
highest in more than two months, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  
 The company’s 5.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in
2017 rose 1.7 cent to 66.2 cents on the dollar as of 11:15 a.m.,
the highest since May 10, Trace data show.  
 The securities increased after Media General Inc. said
today in a statement that it expects the decline in its
publishing revenue “to continue to moderate” and that the
figure may fall 3 percent to 5 percent this quarter compared
with a year earlier. Gannett Co., the owner of USA Today and
television stations, said on July 16 that second-quarter
publishing revenue fell 6 percent to $1 billion, according to a
filing.  
 McClatchy fell 6 cents, or  1.8 percent , to $3.25 at 11:54
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
declined 6.5 percent this year through yesterday and traded as
high as $75.47 in March 2005.  
 The Sacramento, California-based company plans to report
 earnings  on July 29.
