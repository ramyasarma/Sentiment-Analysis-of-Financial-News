             Netflix Inc. , the mail-order and
online movie-rental service, said second-quarter profit rose 34
percent. The shares fell after sales missed analysts’ estimates
and the company said it will spend for more exclusive content.  
 Net income advanced to $43.5 million, or 80 cents a share,
from $32.4 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, the Los Gatos,
California-based company said today in a statement. Sales rose
27 percent to $519.8 million, missing the $525.4 million average
of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  said Netflix will pay
more to get movies and television shows that can be delivered
through the Web to game consoles, Blu-ray players and  Apple
Inc. ’s iPad. The company, which offers DVDs by mail and is
adding online content, said 61 percent of subscribers use its
Web service, up from 55 percent in the first quarter.  
 “We can start to afford some major TV shows and movies on
an exclusive basis,” Hastings said in a statement on the
company’s website. Netflix plans “a mix of more-expensive
exclusive content and lower-cost non-exclusive content.”  
 Second-quarter profit beat the 70-cent average of analysts’
estimates tracked by Bloomberg. The company projected third-
quarter profit of as much as 74 cents a share on sales of as
much as $554 million.  
 Shares Drop  
 Netflix fell $11.05, or 9.2 percent, to $108.60 in extended
trading, after declining 74 cents to $119.65 at 4 p.m New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares have more than
doubled this year as the company takes customers from
traditional video-rental chains such as Blockbuster Inc., which
is closing stores.  
 The combination of streaming and mail-order titles has
helped the company reach 15 million subscribers at June 30, up
42 percent from a year earlier and 7.4 percent from the first
quarter. Netflix raised its subscriber forecast to as many as
18.5 million by year-end, versus an April projection of 17.3
million.  
 Hastings is funneling cash into Netflix’s “Watch
Instantly” service as competition heats up with Coinstar Inc.’s
Redbox movie-rental vending machines and alternatives such as
pay-per-view on cable. Netflix service starts at $8.99 a month
for streaming and one DVD at a time. The company said this week
that it plans a video-streaming service in Canada, its first
foray outside the U.S.  
 “Netflix streaming is only going to be as good as the
content they have,” said  Ed Woo , an analyst at Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. “They believe they have a
significant competitive advantage, but they do not have enough
that it’s not wreckable by everyone else trying to get into this
space.”  
 Hulu Threat  
 Hulu Inc.’s new $9.99 a month Hulu Plus, which delivers
mostly television programs, may “undermine future subscriber
growth at Netflix,”  George Askew , a Baltimore-based analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a July 13 research note.  
 Netflix said on July 6 that it plans to show films online
owned by Relativity Media LLC. On July 15, Netflix expanded its
agreement with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment to add television
shows for streaming including “Nip/Tuck.”  
 “Distribution is becoming a commodity and you need content
in order to differentiate,” said  Tony Wible , an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, who recommends selling
Netflix stock. “Unfortunately for Netflix, there are many
players seeking that same content, which will result in
inflationary pressure.”  
 Earnings for the full year will be $2.58 to $2.86 a share,
up from a previous projection of $2.41 to $2.63 a share, on an
unchanged sales forecast of as much as $2.16 billion.
