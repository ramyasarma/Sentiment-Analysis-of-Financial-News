             Northern Trust Corp ., the third-
largest independent custody bank, reported a 36 percent decline
in second-quarter earnings as near-zero interest rates reduced
revenue from money-market funds and lending services.  
 “Extremely low short-term interest rates” reduced profit
by 19 cents a share, or almost a fifth, when the rates are
compared with historical averages, Chief Financial Officer
 William L. Morrison  said during a conference call with analysts.  
 Net income decreased to $199.6 million, or 82 cents a
share, from $314.2 million, or 95 cents, a year earlier, the
Chicago-based bank said in a statement today. Excluding some
items, profit of 78 cents a share beat the 74-cent average
estimate of 21 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 The U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark
lending rate in the range of zero to 0.25 percent since Dec. 16,
2008, to combat declining credit and job losses. Northern Trust
waived $15.5 million in fees charged to money-fund investors in
the three months ended June 30 to keep their yields positive.
Low rates also reduced the profit Northern Trust earns from
lending cash and securities.  
 The company fell $2.16, or 4.4 percent, to $47.16 at 4:29
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has
declined 10 percent this year, compared with the 12 percent loss
by the Standard & Poor’s 15-member  index  for asset managers and
custody banks.  
 Funds Recouped  
 The bank reported an $8 million after-tax benefit as it
recouped some money set aside to cover the company’s share of
penalties resulting from an antitrust lawsuit by  American
Express Co.  against  Visa Inc.  in 2007. The gain added 4 cents a
share to profit. Northern Trust is a Visa member bank.  
 Northern Trust’s revenue, including net-interest income,
fell 7 percent to $973.8 million in the second quarter. Assets
under custody rose 11 percent to $3.55 trillion as the average
value of the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  for the quarter rose by
27 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. Custody
and fund-administration fees from corporate and institutional
clients increased 15 percent to $161.9 million.  
 The amount of money Northern Trust invests for clients rose
8 percent to $603 million. Investment-management fees from
corporate and institutional clients increased 14 percent to
$69.4 million.  
 Total non-interest expenses jumped 22 percent to $614.4
million, driven by a 12 percent increase in outside services to
$114.6 million. Employee compensation declined 3 percent to
$278.2 million.  
 BNY Mellon, State Street  
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp ., Northern Trust’s biggest
rival, yesterday reported a profit of $658 million as fee
revenue rose 1.8 percent. Boston’s  State Street Corp ., the
second-largest independent custodian, said fee revenue jumped 10
percent, boosting net income to $432 million.  
 Northern Trust recorded a $130.1 million drop in expenses
in last year’s second quarter when seven capital support
agreements for funds ended. The agreements, created in 2008,
committed the company to protect investors from potential losses
in money-market mutual funds and institutional accounts.  
 Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities to institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and hedge funds. The company’s money-management
unit operates mutual funds and investment accounts for
institutions and wealthy individuals.
