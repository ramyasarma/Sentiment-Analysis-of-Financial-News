             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index
extended its rise to a three-week high as metals rose and
traders bet policy makers will slow the pace of interest-rate
increases today.  
 Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron-ore producer, rallied for
a third day as a gauge of metals  prices  climbed the most in more
than five weeks.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA ,
Brazil’s second-biggest steelmaker, gained 2.6 percent as the
company said it plans to boost steel prices after raw-material
costs increased. The Bovespa’s gain was limited as  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, fell on
declining crude prices.  
 “People are more optimistic on China and that a bit slower
growth won’t affect the global economy that much,” said  Debora Morsch , who helps manage 1 billion reais ($564 million) at
Solidus Brokerage in Porto Alegre, Brazil. “Today the Copom
will probably raise half a percentage point since it looks like
we had a small break on the pace of growth.”  
 The Bovespa rose less than 0.1 percent to 64,476.84.
Thirty-eight stocks fell on the index while 26 gained. The gauge
climbed yesterday as traders eased bets for interest-rate
increases and metals producers rallied. The real slipped 0.3
percent to 1.7797 per dollar today.  
 Metals Climb  
 The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index
gained 2.1 percent to 197.20. Stocks in China, Brazil’s biggest
trade partner and consumer of metals, rose for a third day as
the outlook for increased investment in the clean energy
industry and higher domestic consumption overshadowed concern
the government won’t relax its policy tightening measures.  
 Policy makers will raise the Selic  benchmark rate  75 basis
points to 11 percent from 10.25 percent, according to 46 of 49
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three analysts expect a half-
point increase, in line with traders’ bets after a report
yesterday showed prices unexpectedly fell in the month through
mid-July.  
 Vale gained rose 0.6 percent to 41.15 reais.  
 Usiminas gained 2.6 percent to 51.81 reais. Prices will
rise by 3.5 percent to 6 percent as of Aug. 1, Usiminas, as the
Brazilian steelmaker is known, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Petrobras fell 0.5 percent to 27.50 reais. Crude oil slid
after the government reported an unexpected increase in U.S.
supplies and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 11.8 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.3
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.4 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
