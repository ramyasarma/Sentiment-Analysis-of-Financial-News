             Ras al Khaimah, the United Arab
Emirates sheikhdom, is seeking foreign investors to finance
businesses, property and tourism ventures to spur economic
growth.  
 The Ras al Khaimah Investment Authority is in talks with
companies from the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, India and
Pakistan to bring new ventures to the emirate, Khater Massaad,
chief executive of the state-run fund, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  
 The fund attracted $3 billion in foreign investment since
its establishment five years ago, according to the statement.
The economy of the emirate, one of seven making up the U.A.E.,
expanded 9 percent last year, reaching $4.3 billion, the
authority said.  
 The fund aims to turn its focus on domestic projects rather
than foreign ventures,  The National  reported, citing comments
Massaad made at a press conference yesterday. Ras al Khaimah’s
economy will grow 12 percent this year, he was cited as saying
by the Abu Dhabi-based newspaper. Economic growth in the
sheikhdom averaged 14 percent annually from 2004 through 2008.
