             Canada’s opposition Liberal Party
today asked the  parliamentary budget officer  to review the
Conservative government’s plans to buy Lockheed Martin Corp.’s
F-35 fighter jets.  
 The review should focus on the cost of military equipment
bought through a competitive process compared with sole-sourced
contracts, according to a  letter  written by Liberal defense
critic  Ujjal Dosanjh .  
 The Liberals want “an international comparison to see just
how much more Canada must spend on major procurement initiatives
when we opt for a secret, untendered deal over an open,
competitive bidding process,” Liberal lawmaker  Ralph Goodale 
told reporters in Ottawa today.  
 Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s government said July 16 it
planned to buy 65 of the jets for C$9 billion ($8.64 billion).
The government didn’t hold a competition among jet makers to
find the cheapest option, Dosanjh said in his letter. Harper’s
ministers have said that the competition took place when
Lockheed was chosen to build the plane in 2001.  
 The fighter purchase is part of Canada’s effort to replace
its aging military equipment.
