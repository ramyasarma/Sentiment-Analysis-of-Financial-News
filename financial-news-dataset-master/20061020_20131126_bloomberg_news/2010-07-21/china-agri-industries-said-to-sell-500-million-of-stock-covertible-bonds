               China Agri-Industries Holdings Ltd .,
a Hong Kong-listed unit of  China ’s largest grain trader Cofco
Ltd., is selling about $200 million of shares and $300 million
of convertible bonds, said two people with knowledge of the
matter.  
 China Agri-Industries is offering shares at HK$8.75 ($1.13)
to HK$9 apiece, a discount of as much as 7.9 percent to its
closing price of HK$9.5, according to the people, who declined
to be named because the information isn’t public.  
 The Hong Kong-based company is also selling five-year
convertible bonds, which can be swapped for shares when the
stock rises 25 percent to 30 percent above current market
prices, said the people. The bonds will carry a coupon of 1
percent.  
 Investors can require the company to redeem the bonds after
three years at 103.08 percent of face value, according to the
people. The issuer can call the bonds, also after three years,
based on the shares’ performance. If the bonds remain
outstanding until maturity, they will be redeemed at 105.23
percent of par, giving a yield to maturity of 2 percent.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co and  Morgan Stanley  of  New York  are
managing both the stock and bond sales.
