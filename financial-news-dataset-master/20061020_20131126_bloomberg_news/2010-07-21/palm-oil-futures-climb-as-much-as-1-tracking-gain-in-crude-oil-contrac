             Palm oil futures advanced, tracking
gains in soybeans and crude oil, which boosted the appeal of the
tropical oil as a biodiesel feedstock.  
 October-delivery futures jumped as much as 1.3 percent to
2,455 ringgit ($764) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. The most-active contract traded at 2,435 ringgit at
the mid-day break in Kuala Lumpur.  
 “Crude is holding its gain today and that’s supportive for
palm oil prices,” said Alimuhammad Lakdawala, an analyst at
AnandRathi Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai.  
 Oil traded near a three-week high as equities climbed and
an industry report showed a drop in U.S. crude stockpile. Crude
for September delivery was little changed at $77.54 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:36 p.m. Singapore time.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  expects crude palm oil prices for
 immediate delivery  to gain 15 percent to 20 percent this year as
a dry weather impacts Malaysian production. A 35 percent decline
in palm oil inventory in Malaysia from its peak in December will
be positive for prices, Goldman analysts  Patrick Tiah  and  Nikhil Bhandari  said in a report today.  
 “Malaysian crude palm oil production has been relatively
weak due to biological yield stress, but we see more downside
risk in the second half of the year from the lagged impact of
dry weather in early 2010,” the analysts said.  
 Goldman expects U.S. bio-diesel demand to pick up in the
second-half of the year and pressure on palm oil prices to ease
from a record soybean harvest. It expects soybean output to drop
next year on lower yields and acreage.  
 Asian Demand  
 The most-active palm oil contract advanced 9.1 percent in
eight-day period ended July 19 on speculation that demand for
the vegetable oil will climb on Asian demand.  
 Soybeans in Chicago gained as much as 0.4 percent to $9.725
a bushel at 12:35 p.m. Singapore time. December-delivery soybean
oil, which rose 1.2 percent yesterday for the first time in
three days, traded unchanged at 39.19 cents a pound at 12:38 p.m.  
 “There’s increased demand for soybean oils world over and
that may limit gains for palm oil,” AnandRathi’s Lakdawala said.
“Palm oil will find incremental demand only if the premium of
soybean oil price increases substantially.”  
 Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil narrowed to $106.61 a
ton from $110.76 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. The two
oils are direct substitutes.  
 Malaysia’s overseas sales of palm oil dropped three percent
to 879,018 tons in the first 20 days of the month, from the same
period in June, according to cargo surveyor Intertek. Shipments
to China slumped 61 percent to 134,700 tons, the data showed.
Rival Societe Generale de Surveillance said yesterday exports
fell 4.8 percent, with shipments to China down 61 percent and
those to India lower by 7.6 percent.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, which
is pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, fell 0.4 percent to
$752.5 a ton yesterday.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
was little changed at 6,520 yuan ($962) a ton at 11:38 a.m. in
Singapore.
