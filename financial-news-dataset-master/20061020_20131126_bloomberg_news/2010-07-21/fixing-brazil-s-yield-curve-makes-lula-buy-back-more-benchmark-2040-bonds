             Brazil’s benchmark dollar bond
yields more than debt with similar maturities even after an
eight-year rally. President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s 
administration says a stepped-up buyback plan would smooth out
the yield curve and bring borrowing costs back to reality.  
 The yield to the 2015 call date on the 11 percent bonds due
in 2040 fell to 3.18 percent today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While that yield is down from 5.03 percent a year
ago and 20.17 percent in 2002, it remains 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, above other Brazilian notes due in 2015.  
 “The global 2040 bonds distort the yield curve,” Deputy
Treasury Secretary  Paulo Valle  said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia on July 19. The securities “set an erroneous
reference point,” he said.  
 Brazil will buy back more of the bonds after repurchasing
$1.8 billion in the past three years as part of a program to
reduce the number of securities it has in international markets,
Valle said. The bonds have posted an average annual return of 22
percent over the past eight years, rebounding from a tumble to
42 cents on the dollar in July 2002 that was sparked by concern
that Lula would allow the securities to default upon taking
office, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The bond climbed to 136.3 cents today, buoyed by a more
than three-fold surge in Brazilian commodity exports and a
decline in the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of  gross domestic
product  from a high of 6.1 percent in 2003, Lula’s first year in
office.  
 Higher Costs  
 The “high dollar price” is keeping the bond’s yield above
that of similar-maturity securities because some investors
prefer to own debt that was issued at lower interest rates and
that trade closer to par value, Valle said.  
 Brazil sold securities due in 2021 that pay an interest
rate of 4.875 percent, less than half the 11 percent coupon on
the benchmark bonds, in its most recent international bond
offering in April. The 2021 bonds traded at 102.75 cents on the
dollar today, according to JPMorgan.  
 The 2040 bond is “being repurchased and will continue in
this program because it has a high dollar price,” said Valle,
46. “A high dollar price generates an additional yield premium
over Brazil’s sovereign curve, which increases costs for the
Treasury.”  
 Extra Yield  
 The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Brazilian dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was 698 basis points when the
government sold $5.2 billion of the 2040 notes in August 2000,
according to JPMorgan’s EMBI+ index. The so-called spread fell
one basis point today to 220. Brazil’s rating has been boosted
four levels in the past decade to BBB-, the lowest investment-
grade ranking, by Standard & Poor’s.  
 The cost of protecting Brazilian debt against default for
five years was little changed at 123 today, according to data
compiled by CMA DataVision, a London-based credit information
provider. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  
 The real weakened 0.4 percent today at 1.7808 per dollar.
The yield on interest-rate futures contracts due in August rose
five basis points to 10.64 percent, signaling investors expect
the central bank to raise the benchmark rate 50 basis points at
a policy meeting today to 10.75 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Swiss & Global Asset Management AG pared its holdings of
the 2040 securities this month after first purchasing them in
2005, said  Enzo Puntillo , who oversees $1.4 billion of assets as
head of emerging-market fixed income at the firm in Zurich.  
 ‘Little More’  
 “There’s little more to gain from here even though the
story is still attractive,” Puntillo said in a telephone
interview. The bond “was one of our favorite long-term
assets,” he said.  
 The 22 percent average return on Brazil’s benchmark note in
the past eight years beats the  12.9 percent annual gain  on
emerging-market dollar debt, according to JPMorgan’s EMBI+
index.  
 The $1.8 billion in buybacks of the 2040 bonds account for
21 percent of the $8.7 billion of international securities
Brazil has repurchased since 2007, according to the  Treasury .  
 Brazil’s benchmark bond was the most-traded security in
emerging markets from 2006 through 2008, according to a survey
conducted by New York-based Emerging Markets Trade Association.
Trading fell to $44.4 billion last year, dropping below that of
Russia’s most-active bond, from $478 billion in 2006, EMTA said
in a report.  
 “This bond will give way to new 10- and 30-year benchmarks
that were issued with lower coupons,” Valle said. The goal is
“to construct a new yield curve,” he said.
