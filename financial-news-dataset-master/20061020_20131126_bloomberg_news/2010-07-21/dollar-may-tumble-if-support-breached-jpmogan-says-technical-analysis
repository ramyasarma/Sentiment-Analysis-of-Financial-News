             The  Dollar Index  may fall about 4
percent over the next two to three months if it breaches a
“critical support” zone, according technical analysis by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The index, a benchmark for the greenback’s performance
against the currencies of six trading partners, may depreciate
to around 80 if it weakens through the zone between 82 and
81.44, an area bounded by levels that represent a “sustained
breakout” in April and the 50 percent retracement of the rally
that began in November 2009, JPMorgan analyst  Niall O’Connor 
said in a telephone interview from New York.  
 “It wouldn’t surprise me if it consolidates for a few more
weeks before extending lower,” O’Connor said, citing an
oversold U.S. dollar. “If the dollar is able just to hold in
just at resistance levels, then it could be a two- to three-
month timeframe before we get down to those lower levels.”  
 The  index  rose 0.4 percent to 83.045 at 10:13 a.m. in New
York. A decline to O’Connor’s target of 80 to 79.70 would
represent a loss of about 4 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study trading
patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency
or index. Support and resistance refer to lower and upper
boundaries, respectively, of a trading range where buy or sell
orders may be clustered.
