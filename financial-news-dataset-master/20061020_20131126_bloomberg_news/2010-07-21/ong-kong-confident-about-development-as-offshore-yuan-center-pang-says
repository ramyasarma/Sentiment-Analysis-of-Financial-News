             Hong Kong will develop as a center
for offshore yuan products, according to Peter Pang, deputy
chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  
 The de-facto central bank is “confident” about the
development of an offshore yuan market in Hong Kong, Pang said
at a financial conference in Shanghai today.
