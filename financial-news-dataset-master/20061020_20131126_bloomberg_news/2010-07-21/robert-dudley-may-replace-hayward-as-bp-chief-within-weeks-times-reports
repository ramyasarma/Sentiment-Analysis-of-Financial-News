             BP Plc ’s  Robert Dudley  is the front-
runner to replace Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , who is
set to step down in the next 10 weeks, the London-based Times
reported, citing unnamed people close to the company.  
 An announcement about a successor to Hayward, under fire
for BP’s handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, may be
made in late August or early September, the newspaper said.  
 Any leadership change would come as BP seeks to rebuild its
reputation and sell oil fields to raise money for the $20
billion fund Hayward and Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  promised
to compensate Gulf Coast residents. BP agreed to sell assets in
North America and Egypt to  Apache Corp.  for $7 billion, the
London-based company said yesterday.  
 Hayward has the full support of the board and will stay in
office, a BP spokesman said.  
 Dudley, the 54-year-old chief executive officer of  BP’s 
Gulf Coast restoration unit, has been identified by analysts as
a possible successor.  Iain Conn , head of refining and marketing
at BP, and  Andy Inglis , head of exploration and production, were
also possible candidates to replace Hayward, 53, analysts said.  
 BP’s managing director for the Americas and Asia, Dudley
grew up in Mississippi, part of the Gulf Coast region facing
environmental and economic damage after the worst spill in U.S.
history. He has spent about three decades in the oil industry.  
 Dudley ran Amoco Corp.’s Russian operations from 1994 to
1997, before its 1998  acquisition by BP , and also oversaw BP’s
exploration and production across Russia, the Caspian, Angola,
Algeria and Egypt. Dudley emerged as a potential successor amid
increasing attacks from U.S. lawmakers and citizens over
Hayward’s failure to halt the Gulf leak.  
 Shares Slump  
 Hayward, criticized for public relations blunders after the
spill, said on May 30 that he wanted his “life back.” The BP
chief, who took the job in 2007, promised a “laser like focus”
on safety as he sought to reduce expenses and boost output.  
 Putting a U.S. citizen in charge may help limit further
damage to the company,  Greg Smith , U.K. managing director of Fat
Prophets, a stock market research firm, said last month after
Dudley was given day-to-day control of dealing with the spill
crisis.  
 BP fell 40 pence to 387.45 pence  in London  yesterday. The
shares have lost 41 percent of their value in the three months
since the Macondo well blew out, killing 11 crew.
