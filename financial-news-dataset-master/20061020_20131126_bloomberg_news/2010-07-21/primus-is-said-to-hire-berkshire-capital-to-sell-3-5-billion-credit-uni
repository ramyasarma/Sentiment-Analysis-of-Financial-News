             Primus Guaranty Ltd.  hired
investment bank  Berkshire Capital Securities LLC  to help it find
a strategic partner to acquire its approximately $3.5 billion
credit investment management business, according to a person
familiar with the discussions.  
 The business includes eight collateralized loan obligations
of about $2.8 billion, approximately $600 million of
 collateralized swap obligations  and three hedge funds with more
than $100 million of assets, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private. Bids for the
business are due this week, the person said.  
 The company plans to grow its asset management unit’s
market position, it said May 13 during a first-quarter earnings
call. In May 2009 Primus, which is led by Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Jasper , acquired CypressTree Investment
Management LLP, which managed about $2.4 billion of debt at that
time.  
 “We’re very encouraged by the continuing improvement we’re
seeing in the credit market, which is bringing investors who
have been on the sidelines back onto the playing field,” Jasper
said on the call. “This is broadening the base of potential
investors, which should help us to attract third-party capital
and in turn generate a higher level of assets under management
and fee income.”  
 Steven Kennedy, a spokesman for Bermuda-based Primus,
declined to comment. A Berkshire spokeswoman didn’t return a
telephone call seeking comment.  
 CLO Returns  
 CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  
 The safest portions of the CLO, those rated AAA by Standard
& Poor’s, traded at 91 cents on the dollar July 15. They had hit
a low of 69 cents in April 2009, according to Morgan Stanley
data.  
 The CypressTree acquisition was completed in July 2009,
according to the Primus conference call.  Martha Hadeler  and
 Robert Weeden , CypressTree partners and portfolio managers,
joined Primus and assumed responsibility for overseeing the
combined firms’ loan investments, according to a May 12
statement.
