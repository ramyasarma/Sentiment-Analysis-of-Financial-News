             A U.S. Senate panel today approved a
$2 billion program that aims to put 400,000 electric cars on the
road in three years.  
 The legislation from the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee also authorizes a $1.5 billion research
program to lower the cost of vehicle batteries and connecting
them to the electricity grid.  
 The program, to be run by the Energy Department, would
provide electric-car grants to “deployment communities” across
the U.S., said Senator  Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat and
author of the measure. The communities would be studied to help
electric-car manufacturers, power companies and government
officials work out how to get more of the vehicles on the road.  
 Electric cars and hybrids that run on both gasoline and
electricity will help “reduce our excessive dependence on oil
outside of this country,” Dorgan said.
