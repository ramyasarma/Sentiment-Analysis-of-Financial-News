             Producer Bert Marcus, whose
credits include  “Teenage Paparazzo,”  raised more than $15
million to finance films including “How to Make Money
Selling Drugs,” a documentary featuring  50 Cent  and
 Eminem .  
 Marcus is seeking to fill a gap created by larger
Hollywood studios that are making fewer low-budget films.
His Bert Marcus Productions plans to make documentaries and
possibly feature films in the $1 million to $5 million
range, drawing on commitments from private investors for
$15 million to $20 million, Marcus, 28, said in an
interview.  
 “There is a growing market for small documentaries
and features,” Marcus said. “Our goal is to create high
quality material at a price point that makes sense.”  
 “How to Make Money Selling Drugs” chronicles the
effects of drug trafficking on U.S. society. 50 Cent talks
about life in drug-infested neighborhoods and Eminem
discusses addiction. Former U.S. Senator  George Mitchell ,
U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, also is interviewed.  
 “Teenage Paparazzo,” a documentary about
photographer Austin Visschedyk, played at the Sundance Film
Festival in January and will air on HBO in September.
“Entourage” star Adrian Grenier directed.  
 The company also is developing an as-yet untitled
boxing documentary that will include interviews with  Mike Tyson ,  Oscar De La Hoya  and California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger , Marcus said.
