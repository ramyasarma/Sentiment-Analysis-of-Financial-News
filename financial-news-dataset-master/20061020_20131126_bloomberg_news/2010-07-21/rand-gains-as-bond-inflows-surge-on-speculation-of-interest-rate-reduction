             South Africa’s rand strengthened for
a second day after net bond inflows surged more than sevenfold
this week on speculation the central bank will reduce its
benchmark interest rate tomorrow.  
 The currency appreciated as much as 1 percent to 7.5078 per
dollar and traded 0.6 percent stronger at 7.5363 by 4:09 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5830.  
 “There have been strong volumes and bond inflows on the
back of a perceived possible rate cut,” said  Quinten Bertenshaw , a currency analyst in Johannesburg at  Econometrix
Treasury Management , which advises clients on bond and foreign-
exchange transactions. “The inflows promote strength in the
rand. The guys are positioning themselves ahead of the monetary
policy committee meeting.”  
 Foreign investors were net buyers of 10.6 billion rand
($1.4 billion) of bonds in the week through July 16, a more than
sevenfold gain from a week earlier, according to JSE Ltd.
Investors purchased 1.58 billion rand of bonds yesterday.
Today’s inflows will probably be “pretty flat”, according to
Bertenshaw, who expected the rand to trade in a range of 7.65
rand to 7.50 rand to the dollar.  
 Inflation  in Africa’s biggest economy has slowed for 14 of
the past 15 months, reaching 4.6 percent in May and giving the
Reserve Bank scope to reduce its key rate by 5.5 percentage
points since December 2008. The bank left the rate unchanged on
May 13 as South Africa’s economy began to recover from last
year’s 1.8 percent contraction. South African Reserve Bank
Governor  Gill Marcus  and her committee will leave the  benchmark
rate  at 6.5 percent tomorrow, according to 18 out of 26
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 Bonds, Futures  
 Government bonds gained for a second day in South Africa,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
rising 29 cents to 124.72. The yield on the bond declined 9
basis point to 7.58 percent.  
 Money-market futures, used to gauge interest rate
expectations, dropped to a record low. Forward-rate agreements
for  three-month contracts for cash due in one month  fell 7 basis
points to 6.32 percent, set for the lowest close since the
central bank first introduced its repurchase rate in 1999.
