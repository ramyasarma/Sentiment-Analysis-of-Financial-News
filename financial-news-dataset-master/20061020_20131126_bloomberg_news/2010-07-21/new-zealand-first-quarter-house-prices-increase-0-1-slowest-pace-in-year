             New Zealand’s house prices rose at
the slowest pace in a year in the first quarter, according to an
index prepared by Quotable Value New Zealand Ltd., the
government valuation agency.  
 The national house price index rose 0.1 percent in the
three months ended March 31 after increasing 2.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, the Wellington-based agency said in an e-mailed
report. From a year earlier, prices rose 6.4 percent.  
 Prices in main urban areas rose 0.2 percent in the quarter.
Prices in Auckland, the most populous city, were unchanged.
