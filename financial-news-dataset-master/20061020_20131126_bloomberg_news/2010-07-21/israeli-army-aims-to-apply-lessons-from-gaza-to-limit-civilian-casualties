             Israel’s army has taken steps aimed
at limiting civilian casualties, including adding a humanitarian
affairs officer to combat units, following an inquiry into its
2008 offensive in the Gaza Strip, a government report said.  
 “The Israeli military has implemented operational changes
in its orders and combat doctrine designed to further minimize
civilian casualties and damage to civilian property in the
future,” said the report, posted on the  Foreign Ministry 
website on July 19.  
 A UN inquiry into the Gaza war, led by former UN prosecutor
and South African judge Richard Goldstone, accused Israel and
the Islamic militant group Hamas, which controls the Palestinian
territory, of war crimes and called on both parties to
investigate the charges.  
 Israel is conducting 47 criminal inquiries into the
fighting it said was a bid to stop rocket fire on its southern
towns and cities from Gaza. Hamas has said 1,450 Palestinians
were killed during the offensive, while Israel puts the number
at 1,166. The army said 13 Israelis were killed.  
 About 3,200 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into
Israel in 2008, according to the army. More than 400 rockets and
mortars have been fired across the border from the territory
since the operation, killing one foreign worker last March.  
 Israel is currently conducting an investigation into a May
31 naval commando raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla during which
nine Turkish citizens were killed in violence on one of the six
boats.
