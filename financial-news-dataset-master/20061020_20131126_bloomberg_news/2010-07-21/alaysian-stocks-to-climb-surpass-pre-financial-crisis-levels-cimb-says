             Malaysia’s  stock index  may surpass
levels before the start of the global financial crisis in 2008
as the government accelerates economic reforms and construction
projects, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. said.  
 The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  may climb to 1,450 by
the end of 2010, an 8 percent advance from yesterday’s close of
1,337.67, said CIMB analyst  Terence Wong . The measure last
reached that level on Jan. 17, 2008.  
 The expected rebound will help lift the index from its 0.5
percent decline over the past three months, the second-worst
performance in Southeast Asia. The government, which announced
stimulus plans totaling 67 billion ringgit ($21 billion) last
year to help pull the region’s third-largest economy out of a
recession, is studying a proposal for a 36 billion ringgit mass
rapid transit system.  
 “I’m a timid bull, even my timid bull is far more bullish
than most people,” Wong, ranked the third-best analyst in
Malaysia by Institutional Investor magazine this year, said in
an interview in Kuala Lumpur today. “We have so many catalysts;
the MRT is the biggest, and with the budget coming up, this will
boost interest in the market.”  
 The KLCI Index is valued at 15 times estimated earnings,
exceeding the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s  14 times for the first
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that dates back to
January 2006. The measure rose 0.5 percent to 1,344.81 as of
11:12 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  
 Valuations  
 Valuations have risen from the lowest level of 9 times in
October 2008, the year the government’s worst election showing
prompted a foreign selloff that sparked a 39 percent slump in
the index, the most since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.  
 Some analysts have become less optimistic. “Buy” ratings
for Malaysian stocks reached a decade-low of 39.38 percent this
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as Prime
Minister  Najib Razak  said the nation’s economic growth may slow
in the second half because of “external factors.”  
 The  economy  grew 10.1 percent in the three months ended
March 31 after emerging from last year’s recession. It may
expand 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent in 2010, the  central bank 
forecast on March 24. Najib is scheduled to unveil the nation’s
budget on Oct. 15.  
 Wong, who in September correctly predicted the index’s gain
for 2009, is betting on the government’s bid to transform
Malaysia into a high-income nation and subsidy cuts to help spur
the stock market.  
 Malaysia aims to almost halve its budget deficit in the
next five years as it widens its tax base and reduces expenses
under a plan to make the economy more competitive, while
increasing investments in projects including mass transit
facilities. The government removed fuel and sugar subsidies this
month to help save more than 750 million ringgit this year.  
 “It’s a good sign,” Wong said. “It shows there’s some
courage and some success in execution. I’m a lot more bullish
than most.”
