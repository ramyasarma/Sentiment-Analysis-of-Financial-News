             The Chinese government’s current
property market regulations are “very dangerous” as they could
lead to stable yet prolonged high prices, the China Daily cited
Yuan Gangming, an economist at Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.  
 Chinese policymakers are in a “power struggle” with
developers, which may lead the government to impose tougher
measures or capitulate, Yuan said, according to the newspaper.
