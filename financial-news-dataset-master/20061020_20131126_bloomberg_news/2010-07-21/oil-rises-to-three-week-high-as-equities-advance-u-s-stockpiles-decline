             Crude oil fell after the government
reported an unexpected increase in U.S. supplies and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic outlook
remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 Inventories  climbed 360,000 barrels to 353.5 million in the
week ended July 16, an Energy Department report showed.
Stockpiles of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, also increased. The price
dropped 39 cents after Bernanke began speaking to the Senate
Banking Committee.  
 “The first thought that came to mind was that this report
is bearish, bearish, bearish,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst with
Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in Villanova,
Pennsylvania. “There were inventory gains in each of the three
major categories.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell $1.02, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $76.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Crude has gained 18 percent in the past year.  
 Bernanke said the Fed’s “somewhat weaker outlook” is due
in part to financial markets that “have become less supportive
of economic growth in recent months.” He said the Fed is
prepared to act as needed to aid growth.  
 Equities also declined after Bernanke began his testimony.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 11 points from 2 p.m. to
2:30 p.m. It slipped 1.5 percent to 1,067.74 at 3:08 p.m.  
 Refinery Operations  
 Refineries operated at 91.5 percent of capacity, up 1
percentage point from the prior week. A drop of 0.35 percentage
point drop was forecast, according to the Bloomberg News survey.  
 Inventories of crude oil were forecast to drop by 1.2
million barrels, according to the median of 17 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Stockpiles of crude oil  at Cushing, Oklahoma , where New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil is delivered, rose
985,000 barrels to 37.1 million, the biggest increase since
April, the report showed.  Crude oil imports  increased 7.5
percent to 9.98 million barrels a day, the biggest one-week gain
since April.  
 Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.12 million barrels to 222.2
million barrels last week, the highest level since April, the
report showed. Supplies of distillate fuel rose 3.94 million
barrels to 166.6 million, the biggest increase since the week
ended Jan. 9, 2009.  
 “This is a pretty clear case of supply outpacing demand,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “The distillate data was particularly bearish, with
inventories at the highest level for this time of year since at
least 1982.”  
 Fuel Demand  
 Total U.S. fuel consumption increased 3.2 percent to 19.4
million barrels a day, the report showed. Demand is up 2.5
percent from a year earlier and down 7.7 percent from 21 million
barrels a day three years earlier.  
 “While demand is up from the low levels we saw last year,
it is well short of the record highs seen in 2007,” Evans said.  
 Oil in New York has traded in a range of $8.29 for 30
trading days, from $71.09 to $79.38 a barrel.  
 “The builds are bearish, but not enough to move the market
out of its range,” said  Andre Julian , chief financial officer
and senior market strategist at OpVest Wealth Management in
Irvine, California. “OPEC wants to keep oil in a $70-to-$80
range and consumers aren’t complaining.”  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries left
production targets unchanged when ministers last gathered in
Vienna on March 17. The group’s next meeting is scheduled for
Oct. 14.  
 Fair Price  
 Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said in April that
prices in the $70-to-$80 range are “as close to perfect as
possible” and that he hoped oil would remain in that range.
 King Abdullah  has targeted $75 oil as a fair price for consumers
and producers. The kingdom is OPEC’s biggest oil producer.  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement slipped 85 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to end the session at $75.37 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 Oil also fell as the dollar gained against the euro,
reducing the appeal of commodities to investors. The greenback
traded at $1.2753 per euro, up 1 percent from $1.288 yesterday,
and headed for biggest gain since June 4.  
 The National Hurricane Center said a weather system over
Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic has a 50 percent chance
of developing into a stronger storm within two days, according
to an advisory on its website at about 1:30 p.m. Miami time.
That’s down from a 70 percent probability earlier today.  
 Gulf of Mexico  
 Concern that a storm would develop and threaten platforms
and ports in the Gulf of Mexico helped bolster prices earlier
today. The Gulf accounts for about 31 percent of U.S. oil output
and 10 percent of its natural-gas production and is home to
seven of the 10 busiest ports, according to the Energy
Department. States along the Gulf are home to 43 percent of
operable U.S. refining capacity.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 523,664 contracts as of 3:08
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 458,768 contracts yesterday, 37
percent below the average of the past three months and the
lowest since July 2. Open interest was 1.21 million contracts,
the lowest level since Dec. 31.
