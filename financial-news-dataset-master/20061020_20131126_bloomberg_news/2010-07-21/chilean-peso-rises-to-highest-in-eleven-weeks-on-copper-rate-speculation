             Chile’s peso climbed to an 11-week
high on rising prices of the country’s main export, copper, and
 expectations  of faster interest-rate increases.  
 The peso strengthened 0.7 percent to 526.05 per U.S. dollar
as of 10:03 a.m. New York time from 529.55 yesterday. It earlier
reached 525.25, the strongest since May 4.  
 Copper for September delivery rose as much as 3.5 percent
to $3.1065 a pound as stockpiles fell and investors increased
exposure to risky assets as global equities rose. Traders are
also speculating that Chile’s central bank may increase the pace
of interest-rate rises after frosts damaged crops and threatened
to push up the price of food.  
 “The bounce in equities is feeding through into
commodities and so all the commodity currencies are doing
well,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. “Rates are moving up
in Chile on the expectation that the central bank will front-
load hikes to contain inflationary pressures building up because
of extraordinary events like the cold weather.”  
 If the peso breaches its 200-day average of 522 per dollar
it may jump to 517 or 513, Cattan-Naslausky said.  
 Chile’s central bank may increase its benchmark interest
rate by 0.75 percentage point, the fastest since 2001, as a
“perfect inflationary storm” threatens, economists at Banco de
Credito e Inversiones wrote today in a note to clients.  
 Inflation expectations have soared to the highest in 20
months, as shown by swap rates, as frosts damage crops and the
costs of transport and electricity rise. The one-year interest-
rate swap rate, which reflects traders’ expectations of average
borrowing costs, rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 3.45 percent, the highest since February 2009.
