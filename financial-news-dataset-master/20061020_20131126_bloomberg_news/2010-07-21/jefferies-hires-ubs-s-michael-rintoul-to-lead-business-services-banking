             Jefferies Group Inc. , the New York-
based investment bank that increased its staff by more than 25
percent in two years, hired  Michael Rintoul  as head of business-
services investment banking.  
 Rintoul most recently was head of technology-services
investment banking at  UBS AG , Jefferies said today in a
statement. Business services includes outsourcing, transaction
processing, professional, government, education and marketing
services, according to the statement.  
 “Business Services is an industry of strategic focus for
Jefferies, as clients in this sector heavily utilize our
capabilities in equity distribution, leveraged finance and sell-
side M&A,”  Benjamin Lorello , global head of investment banking,
said in the statement.  
 Lorello joined Jefferies from UBS in June 2009 and led the
defection of 36 health-care bankers from Zurich-based UBS to
Jefferies. UBS, the biggest Swiss bank, accused Jefferies in a
lawsuit of raiding the company. The suit was later settled.  
 Jefferies has increased its head count to 2,821 from 2,241
in 2008, taking advantage of the collapse of larger investment
banks. The firm reported a record $256 million in investment-
banking revenue for the second quarter, more than double the
$120.8 million from a year earlier.
