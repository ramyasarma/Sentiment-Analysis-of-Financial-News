             Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds held
at a four-year low on speculation interest payments coming due
next week will spur demand for the securities.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 was little changed at 7.46 percent at 4:11 p.m. New York
time, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. That’s the lowest
level since March 2006. The bond’s price fell 0.005 centavo to
124.353 centavos per peso.  
 The Finance Ministry is slated to pay on July 26 2.1
trillion pesos ($1.12 billion) in interest on its fixed-rate
peso bonds, known as TES, due July 2020 and July 2024.  
 “There’s ample liquidity in the market and it will
increase with the coupon payments,” said  Daniel Lozano , an
analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Serfinco SA. “That liquidity
is helping feed into strong appetite for TES.”  
 Yields on the 2020 bonds have dropped 1.7 percentage points
in the last five months.  
 Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at a government auction of
300 billion pesos of inflation-linked bonds today.  
 The nation sold inflation-linked bonds, known as TES UVR,
due February 2023 to yield 3.84 percent, down from 4.38 percent
in the previous sale on June 16, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Finance Ministry. The yield on the securities
maturing in May 2017 fell to 3.38 percent from 4.1 percent.  
 Colombia’s peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,867.40 per U.S.
dollar, from 1,874.50 yesterday. The currency has jumped 9.5
percent this year versus the dollar, the best performance among
world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Colombian markets were
closed yesterday for Independence Day.
