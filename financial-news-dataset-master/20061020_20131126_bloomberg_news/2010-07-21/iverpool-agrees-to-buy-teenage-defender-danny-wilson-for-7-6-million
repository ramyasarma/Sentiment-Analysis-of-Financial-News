             Liverpool agreed to “a deal in
principle” to buy teenage defender Danny Wilson from Glasgow
Rangers for as much as 5 million pounds ($7.6 million), the
soccer clubs said.  
 The transfer of Wilson, who won two Scottish young player
of the year awards last season, remains “subject to paperwork
being completed,” Rangers said late yesterday on their website.  
 “Liverpool’s offer will see the club receive 2 million
pounds up front with add-ons linked to games played, taking the
total value of the deal to 5 million pounds,” Rangers Chief
Executive Officer Martin Bain said in a statement.  
 Wilson, 18, would be Liverpool’s second acquisition this
week after the Premier League club signed England forward  Joe Cole  on a free transfer two days ago.
