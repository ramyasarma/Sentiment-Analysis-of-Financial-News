             Japanese  bonds  rose, sending
benchmark yields to a seven-year low, after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the outlook for the world’s
largest economy is “unusually uncertain.”  
 Ten-year  bonds  rallied for a second day as Bernanke’s
comments added to speculation the global recovery is slowing,
spurring demand for the safety of debt. Bond futures climbed to
the highest since 2003 before U.S. reports that economists said
will show initial claims for jobless benefits rose and existing-
home sales fell. The Ministry of Finance sold 20-year debt today
with a lowest price above that forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “It will take some time before the anxiety about the fate
of the global economy can be removed,” said  Masaru Hamasaki ,
chief strategist in Tokyo at Toyota Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $15 billion. “Bonds will continue to
draw buying, helping 10-year yields stay below the fair value
level of 1.2 percent.”  
 The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell three basis
points to 1.055 percent as of 3:08 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.1 percent security due June 2020 rose 0.269 yen to 100.403 yen.
Yields dropped to 1.045 percent, the lowest since August 2003.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery added 0.17 to
141.87 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after
earlier rising as high as 142.08.  
 Ready to Act  
 Bonds advanced around the world after Bernanke told the
Senate Banking Committee in Washington yesterday that central
bankers were ready to act to support growth. The Fed Chairman
will testify to the House Financial Services Committee today.  
 The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average slid for a fifth day, losing
0.6 percent, after U.S. shares dropped yesterday.  
 U.S.  initial jobless claims  rose to 445,000 last week from
429,000 the prior period, according to a Bloomberg survey before
the Labor Department report today. The National Association of
Realtors will say  sales  of previously owned homes fell in June
by the most this year, a separate survey showed.  
 “The debt market has more room to price in downside risks
to the economy,” said  Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Japan’s 10-year yield may head
for the 1 percent mark.”  
 The Finance Ministry sold 1.1 trillion yen ($12.7 billion)
of 20-year debt with a lowest price of 99.75, higher than the
99.65 estimated by traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The sale drew bids for 4.46 times the amount on offer,
compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of the average of
3.35 for the past 10 auctions.  
 Monthly Return  
 “Given the risk of further appreciation of the yen
stemming from growing uncertainties about the U.S. economy, and
its potential impact on Japan’s economy, bond investors can’t
really sell their holdings,’ said  Tadashi Matsukawa , who helps
oversee the equivalent of $65.3 billion as manager of the fixed-
income division at PineBridge Investments Japan Co. in Tokyo.  
 The yen changed hands at 86.44 per dollar, near a seven-
month high of 86.27 reached on July 16.  
 The country’s large manufacturers expect the yen to average
90.16 per dollar in the six months to March 2011, according to
the Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey released July 1.  
 Japan’s government bonds handed investors a return of 0.1
percent so far this month, adding to a return of 2.2 percent
between January and June, the best first half since 2001,
according to an index compiled by Bank of America Corp’s Merrill
Lynch & Co. unit.  
 Japan’s 10-year yields will rise to 1.3 percent by the end
of this year, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
If the survey proves right, investors who buy government debt
today and sell at the end of the year will incur a loss of 1.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
