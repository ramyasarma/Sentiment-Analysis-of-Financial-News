             Peru’s sol was little changed after
overseas demand for the local currency was offset by Finance
Ministry plans to coordinate dollar purchases with the central
bank to help slow the sol’s appreciation.  
 The sol traded at 2.8250 per U.S. dollar at 3:07 p.m. New
York time, from 2.8240 yesterday.  
 Deputy Finance Minister  Luis Miguel Castilla  said the
Treasury may buy dollars before Peru’s Independence Day holiday
on July 28 after a rise in speculative capital inflows,
according to state news agency Andina. The central bank has
bought $1.37 billion this month to ease gains in the sol and
raised reserve requirements for local and foreign currency.  
 “There seems to be a reordering of positions by banks
after the comments by the Finance Ministry and recent purchases
by the central bank,” said  Gonzalo Navarro , head trader at
Banco Santander in Lima. “The sale of dollars by some operators
has stopped and the market seems to be more balanced, which
could be because of adjustments to the reserve mandate.”  
 The central bank didn’t  intervene  in the foreign exchange
market today, it said on its website.  
 The Finance Ministry could buy dollars to service its debt
using reserves that have grown by 6.1 billion soles in the last
six months, New York-based 4Cast Inc. said in a note to clients.
It could also use the reserves to repurchase dollar bonds, 4Cast
said.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 was unchanged at 5.53 percent, according to
Citigroup Inc.’s local unit.  
 The government plans to sell as much as 400 million soles
($141.6 million) of sol-denominated bonds in the local market
tomorrow, according to a statement published today in the state
gazette.  
 The government will offer 300 million soles at a fixed rate
of 6.95 percent in a re-opening of its August 2031 bond. It will
also sell 100 million soles at a rate of 7.84 percent in a re-
opening of its August 2020 bond.
