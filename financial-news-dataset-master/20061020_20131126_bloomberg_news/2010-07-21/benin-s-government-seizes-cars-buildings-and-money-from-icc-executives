             Benin authorities said they have
seized 30 vehicles, 200 buildings and 6 billion CFA francs
($11.7 million) from the managers of ICC Services, which failed
to repay its depositors.  
 The assets were taken from the company’s director general,
Emile Tegbenou, and other executives, Justin Gbenanmeto,
president of the commission investigating the financial services
company, told reporters in Cotonou, the commercial capital,
today.  
 The seized assets add to the 6 billion CFA francs found in
ICC accounts when it was taken over by the state. Benin will
start reimbursing 150,000 depositors in the company in October,
Finance Minister  Idriss Daouda  said on July 19. ICC’s customers
lost about 100 billion CFA francs.
