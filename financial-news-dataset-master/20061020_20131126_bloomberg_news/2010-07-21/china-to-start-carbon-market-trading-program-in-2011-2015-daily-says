             China will begin a carbon-trading
program from 2011 to 2015, the period of its 12th five-year
plan, the China Daily reported, citing an unidentified person
attending a closed meeting chaired by Xie Zhenhua, deputy
director of the National Development and Reform Commission.  
 The type of carbon-trading scheme to be adopted was not
decided at the meeting, the report said.
