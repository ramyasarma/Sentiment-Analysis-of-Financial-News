             Legg Mason Inc.’s  Bill Miller  said
investors have a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to buy U.S.
stocks with large market capitalizations at the cheapest prices
in almost six decades.  
 “The best quality companies” have been out of favor with
investors and are trading at the lowest levels relative to bonds
since 1951, Miller wrote in a letter to investors released today
by the Baltimore-based fund company, where he is chairman and
chief investment officer of its Legg Mason Capital Management
unit. “The public’s distaste for equities is palpable and
understandable.”  
 Miller’s view is shared by well-known money managers
including  Jeremy Grantham  of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co.
and  Donald Yacktman  of Yacktman Asset Management Co. Large
stocks, as tracked by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,  lost an
average of 1.6 percent a year in the 10 years ended June 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 It’s “nearly certain” quality U.S. stocks, those with
high stable returns and low debt, will outperform the stock
market in the next seven years, Grantham said in January. He
repeated that forecast in a July 19 letter to investors of
Boston-based GMO.  
 The premium investors are paying on small stocks over large
ones is almost the biggest in 27 years, said  James Floyd , senior
analyst at Leuthold Group LLC, a research firm based in
Minneapolis.  
 As of June 30, large stocks sold for an average price-to-
earnings multiple of 13.6 compared with 16 for small stocks. The
18 percent gap between the two approaches the widest margin
since Leuthold began gathering the data in December 1982, Floyd
said.  
 Exxon, Kimberly-Clark  
 Leuthold defines large stocks as those with a market value
of more than $8.4 billion and small stocks as those from $255
million to $1.3 billion.  
 Miller’s letter said energy producer  Exxon Mobil Corp . and
 Kimberly-Clark Corp. , a consumer-products maker, are examples of
big stocks being ignored by investors.  
 Miller, 60, known for beating the S&P 500 Index a record 15
straight years through 2005, trailed the U.S. market benchmark
for the next three years. His $4 billion  Legg Mason Capital
Management Value Trust  lost 6.7 percent this year through
yesterday, trailing 97 percent of competitors, Bloomberg data
show. Miller’s $1.8 billion  Legg Mason Capital Management
Opportunity Trust  fell 1.9 percent, ranking him behind 83
percent of peers.  
 Miller said stocks in the S&P 500 Index underperformed
long-term Treasuries, as measured by the Barclay’s Capital Long
Term Treasury Bond total return index, in the past 20 years.  
 “It’s almost a tautology in capital markets that the best
investments are those with the worst previous returns,” wrote
Miller, making the case for stocks.
