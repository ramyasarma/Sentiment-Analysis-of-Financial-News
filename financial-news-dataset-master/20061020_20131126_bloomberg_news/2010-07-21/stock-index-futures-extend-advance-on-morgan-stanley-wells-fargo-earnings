             U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after better-than-estimated profit at Morgan Stanley and
Wells Fargo & Co. bolstered optimism in the earnings season.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 0.4 percent to 1,084.5 at 8:06 a.m. in New
York, extending an earlier advance helped by higher-than-
estimated results at Apple Inc. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures climbed 0.4 percent to 10,216.
