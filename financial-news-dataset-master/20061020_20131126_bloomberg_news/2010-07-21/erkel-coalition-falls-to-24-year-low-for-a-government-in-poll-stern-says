             Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition
of Christian Democrats, the Christian Social Union and the Free
Democrats fell to a combined 34 percent support in a Forsa poll,
Stern magazine said, the lowest figure since Forsa started
compiling data for Stern in 1986.  
 The Social Democrats and the Greens rose to a combined 47
percent support, enough to win an absolute majority in the
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, Stern cited the Forsa
poll as saying. Forsa interviewed 2,500 people July 12-16 and
the margin of error was 2.5 percentage points, Stern said.
