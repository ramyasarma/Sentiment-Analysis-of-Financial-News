             Morgan Stanley  said it will miss
profit-margin goals for its brokerage joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.’s Smith Barney, blaming the May 6 market crash
for scaring away investors.  
 “Hitting those targets, given it’s a fairly formulaic
business in many respects, will get pushed out because the
performance is market-dependent,” Chief Financial Officer  Ruth Porat  said today in an interview.  
 James Gorman , who led the wealth-management business before
becoming chief executive officer in January, said in February
the bank expected to increase the unit’s pretax profit margin to
15 percent by the end of this year and to more than 20 percent
by the end of 2011. The margin was 7 percent in the second
quarter, down from 9 percent in the first, Morgan Stanley said
today in announcing earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  
 Gorman, 52, also set out a goal of more than $20 billion in
net new client assets for this year and $50 billion for 2011.
The wealth-management unit, led by  Charles Johnston , had new
asset outflows of $5.5 billion in the second quarter, after $9.3
billion of net new client assets in the first.  
 The so-called flash crash of May 6 erased $862 billion in
value from U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. Consulting
firm  Accenture Plc  fell as much as 99 percent before rebounding,
and almost 20,800 trades were later canceled. Regulators have
put circuit-breaker programs in place to help prevent short-term
panics.  
 ‘Sheer Randomness’  
 “The impact that the flash crash had on the individual
investor psyche, it almost seems that the sheer randomness of it
was kind of the tipping point,” Porat, 52, said. “We saw a
real step-back from the market, and given that this is a scale
 business , having that activity pull out, particularly the
transaction-related activity, put real pressure on the
margins.”  
 Global wealth management posted pretax income of $207
million, compared with a loss of $71 million in the second
quarter of 2009, when Morgan Stanley completed the joint
venture, the company said today. The unit had $3.07 billion in
revenue, down from $3.11 billion in the first quarter.  
 Gorman said in a  letter  to shareholders earlier this month
that the joint venture will play “an increasingly important
role” in the firm’s growth.  
 “We need retail investors to re-engage,” Porat said in the
interview. “We’re continuing to execute, because that’s what we
can do and that positions us better for those days that always
do return, but for now our view is that hitting the targets in
our metrics that matter will get pushed out.”
