             The dollar may fall below 85 yen
should the Federal Reserve take more easing steps while the
Bank of Japan refrains, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose  1.1 percent in New
York yesterday on speculation the Fed will cut the interest rate
it pays on banks’ excess reserves. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
will give his semiannual report on monetary policy to the Senate
Banking Committee today and will testify at the House Financial
Services Committee tomorrow.  
 Any signs of easing “would probably lead to lower U.S.
yields and USD-JPY selloff, as USD-JPY is highly sensitive to
yield differentials,”  Tomoko Fujii , Tokyo-based foreign-
exchange strategist at Merrill, wrote in a report today. “The
BOJ has an opportunity to forestall USD-JPY drops, but the BOJ’s
response has tended to be too little and too late.”  
 The dollar may test the 14-year low it reached in November
should the central banks diverge in stimulus policy, Fujii said.
The greenback slumped to 84.83 yen on Nov. 27, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 The Bank of Japan won’t take policy action based on the
yen’s level, Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi told reporters
today in Toyama, central Japan.  
 The  spread  between yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries and
those on Japanese 10-year government bonds narrowed to 180 basis
points on July 6, a level not seen since May 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread was 186 basis points
today.
