             Yuan forwards dropped to the weakest
level this month on concern China’s slowing economy will prompt
the central bank to limit gains in the currency.  
 The yuan’s reference rate for daily trading has dropped 0.1
percent since data last week showed  growth  in the world’s third-
largest economy moderated in the second quarter. Commerce
Ministry spokesman Yao Jian said yesterday an improvement in the
trade balance will create favorable conditions for the
currency’s stability. Government bonds advanced.  
 “Because of the slowdown, there is little momentum for the
yuan to appreciate,” said  Guan Jiaying , a currency analyst in
Beijing at China Citic Bank Co., a unit of China’s biggest
state-investment company. “The currency may rise to about 6.7
by the end of this year.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent
to 6.6870 per dollar as of 12:35 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 1.4 percent from the spot rate
of 6.7783, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts touched 6.6925, the weakest level since June 29.  
 The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate at
6.7802 today, compared with 6.7812 yesterday.  
 A government report issued on July 15 showed the economy
expanded 10.3 percent in the second quarter, slowing from growth
of 11.9 percent in the previous three months.  Industrial
production  in June rose 13.7 percent from a year earlier,
following a gain of 16.5 percent in May.  
 The central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19
after holding the currency stable during the global financial
crisis to aid exporters. The currency has since gained 0.7
percent.  
 Bonds Advance  
 Government bonds rose after the finance ministry sold
seven-year debt at a yield lower than that in secondary-market
trading.  
 The ministry sold at least 28 billion yuan ($4.1 billion)
of bonds due in July 2017 at a yield of 2.76 percent, seven
basis points lower than that on the Interbank Bond Market
yesterday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of finance
companies was for a 2.75 percent rate.  
 “Bond yields dropped mainly because the yield at the
auction today was much lower than that on the secondary
market,” said  Chen Jianbo , a Beijing-based bond analyst at BOC
International (China) Ltd., the investment banking arm of Bank
of China Ltd.  
 The yield on the 2.33 percent note due in June 2013 slid
three basis points to 2.28 percent, and the price of the
security added 0.08 per 100 yuan face amount to 100.13,
according to the Interbank Market data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures lending costs
between banks, rose for the first time in four days, rising two
basis points to 1.85 percent, according to the National
Interbank Funding Center.
