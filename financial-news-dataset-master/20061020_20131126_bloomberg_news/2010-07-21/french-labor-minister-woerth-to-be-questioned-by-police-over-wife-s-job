             French police will question Labor
Minister  Eric Woerth  over allegations he helped his wife get a
job as a financial adviser to the nation’s richest woman,
government spokesman Luc Chatel said on television news channel
 La Chaine Info .  
 Paris police started questioning Florence Woerth today, La
Chaine Info reported. She worked for L’Oreal SA heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  before quitting last month amid a probe by
authorities into possible tax evasion.  
 Woerth denied on  Europe 1  radio yesterday that he asked
another Bettencourt financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre, to
hire his wife.
