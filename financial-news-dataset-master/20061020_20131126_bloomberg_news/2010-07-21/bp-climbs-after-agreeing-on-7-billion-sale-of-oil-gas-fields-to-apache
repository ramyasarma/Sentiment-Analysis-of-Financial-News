             BP Plc  rose in London trading after
agreeing to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S., Canada and
Egypt to  Apache Corp.  for $7 billion, raising cash to meet the
costs of the Gulf of Mexico spill.  
 Apache will buy BP’s Permian Basin holdings in Texas and
southeast New Mexico and gas properties in western Canada,
London-based BP said yesterday after the close of trading. BP
also agreed to sell exploration concessions in Egypt.  
 BP  climbed  as much as 3 percent to 398.90 pence and traded
at 398.70 pence as of 8:40 a.m. local time. The stock has
dropped 39 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on
April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill
in U.S. history.  
 Europe’s largest oil producer by volume said last month it
would sell $10 billion of assets to raise cash for the $20
billion fund demanded by President Barack Obama to compensate
victims of the oil spill.  BP  also suspended dividend payments
and cut investment spending.  
 BP said Apache will pay a deposit of $5 billion in cash on
July 30. The total price of $7 billion includes $3.1 billion for
the Permian properties, $3.25 billion for assets in western
Canada and $650 million for the Egyptian assets, according to
BP’s statement.  
 Robert Dudley , the BP executive running the spill cleanup
operation, is the front-runner to replace Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Hayward , who is set to step down in the next 10
weeks, the London-based Times reported, citing unidentified
people close to the company.  
 Hayward has the full support of the board and will stay in
his post, a BP spokesman said.
