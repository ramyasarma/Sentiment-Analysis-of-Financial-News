             Telenor ASA, the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, said second-quarter net income rose to
9.49 billion kroner, from 1.38 billion kroner a year earlier.
This beat the 9.14 billion-krone mean of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales rose to 25.2 billion kroner in the period, the
company said today.
