             Google Inc. increased its spending
on lobbying by 50 percent as the U.S.  Federal Communications
Commission  began looking at ways to regulate Internet access.  
 Google, based in Mountain View, California, spent $2.7
million on lobbying activities in the first six months of 2010,
compared with $1.8 million during the same period a year
earlier.  
 The company supported an FCC proposal in June to seek
comments on how the commission could regulate Internet providers
such as  Verizon Communications Inc . and  Comcast Corp .  
 FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  has proposed that the
agency use the same rules to regulate the Internet that it now
uses to oversee telephone service. Verizon chief executive  Ivan Seidenberg  has said the idea would “cause uncertainly in the
marketplace, create disincentives for investment,” and make the
telecommunications industry less competitive.  
 Genachowski’s efforts followed a U.S. appeals court
decision in April that the FCC didn’t have the authority to
censure Comcast for blocking subscribers using peer-to-peer
software often used to view videos.
