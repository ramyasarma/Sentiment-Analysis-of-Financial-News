             Siemens AG , Germany’s biggest
engineering company, said hackers created a program that attacks
software used to control water-processing plants, power grids
and factories.  
 Siemens said it was notified July 14 that a  malicious
program  dubbed Stuxnet is targeting Siemens’ Simatic WinCC, a
supervisory control program that the world’s infrastructure
agencies and manufacturers use to acquire and analyze data.  
 The company alerted customers two days later, Wieland
Simon, a spokesman for Siemens Industry, said today in an
interview from Erlangen, Germany. Siemens doesn’t know whether
the malware is trying to wrest control of Siemens’ application
or steal information, Simon said.  
 “We have found out the software is capable of sending
data, and it tries to set up a connection via the Internet,”
Simon said. “We don’t know where the data is being sent.”  
 Siemens said infection, which can occur only when someone
attempts to gain access to Simatic WinCC using a USB stick,
exploits a security breach in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows
operating system. The Munich-based company said it knows of only
one system, in Germany, that’s infected.  
 Microsoft is working to fix the breach, according to
Siemens’ website. A patch, which customers can download to
detect and remove the malware, will be released tomorrow, Simon
said.
