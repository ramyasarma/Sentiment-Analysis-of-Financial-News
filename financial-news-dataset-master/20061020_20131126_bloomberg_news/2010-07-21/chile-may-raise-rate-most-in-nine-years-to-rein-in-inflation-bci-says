             Chile’s central bank may increase
borrowing costs by the most in nine years as a message to
traders who have driven inflation expectations to 20-month
highs, Banco de Credito e Inversiones said.  
 Interest-rate swaps leapt the most in a month today after
BCI, Chile’s third-biggest lender by market value, called for
the central bank to raise its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage
point to 2.25 percent. The one-year swap rate, which reflects
traders’  expectations  of the average benchmark rate for the next
12 months, rose 13 basis points to 3.50 percent as of 4:07 p.m.
New York time.  
 The central bank should act to curb soaring inflation
expectations,  Jorge Selaive , chief economist at Chile’s third-
largest lender, said today in an interview. The one-year
breakeven inflation rate reached a 20-month high of 4.29 percent
today, according to Bloomberg calculations, as frost-damaged
crops led to speculation of more expensive food.  
 “The market has a vision that the central bank will let
inflation get away from it and if that’s the case the bank
should send a hawkish signal,” said Selaive, who worked at the
central bank before joining BCI. “The central bank should raise
the rate more than consensus to show its determination to keep
inflation under control.”  
 The median forecast of 35 economists in a July 9 central
bank survey was that the bank would raise the rate by half a
percentage point to 2 percent at its next meeting on Aug. 12.  
 Chile is menaced by a “perfect inflationary storm,” BCI
economists wrote in a note to clients today.  
 Frosts Damage Crops  
 Chilean inflation expectations as shown by swap rates have
soared to the highest in 20 months as frosts damage crops and
the costs of transport and electricity rise. The one-year
breakeven inflation rate, which measures the average 12-month
inflation, rose seven basis points to 4.32 percent today and the
two-year rate rose six basis points to 3.78 percent.  
 The inflation forwards market is discounting consumer price
inflation of 3.92 percent next year, according to Banco
Santander SA prices, up from 3.5 percent on July 12.  
 The central bank targets inflation of around 3 percent in
two year’s time. In August 2001, the bank increased its
 overnight rate  to 6.5 percent from 3.5 percent.  
 Chile’s peso climbed to an 11-week high on rising prices of
the country’s main export, copper, and  expectations  of faster
interest-rate increases.  
 Peso Rallies  
 The peso strengthened 1.2 percent to 523.15 per U.S. dollar
from 529.55 yesterday. It earlier reached 522.72, the strongest
intraday level since May 4. Copper for September delivery rose
as much as 3.5 percent to $3.1065 a pound as stockpiles fell.  
 Chile’s central bank raised borrowing costs for the second
straight month on July 15, raising the overnight rate by a half
point to 1.5 percent.  
 The bank’s policy makers said they would continue to raise
rates after the economy grew 7.1 percent in May from a year
earlier and industrial output rose for the first time since a
February earthquake diminished productive capacity.  
 Gross domestic product is set to expand 4.3 percent this
year and 6 percent in 2011, making it the fastest-growing major
economy in the region next year, the United Nations’ economic
unit for the region said today in a statement.
