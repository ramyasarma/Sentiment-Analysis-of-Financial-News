             Vale SA, the world’s biggest iron-
ore miner, has completed 75 percent of work needed to start
production at its Moatize coal mine in northwestern Mozambique,
state controlled Radio Mozambique reported on its website,
citing Fabio Bechara, the company financial manager.  
 Vale has invested $719 million of the planned $1.3 billion
it targeted for the southern African nation for the coal mining
concession acquired in 2004, the Maputo-based broadcaster said.  
 Vale identified Brazil, China, India and Japan as markets
it wants to export the coal, Radio Mozambique said.
