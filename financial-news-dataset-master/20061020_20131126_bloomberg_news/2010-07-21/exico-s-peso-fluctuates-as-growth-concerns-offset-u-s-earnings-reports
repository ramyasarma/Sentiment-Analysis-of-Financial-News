             Mexico’s peso fluctuated as concern
the global economic recovery is faltering offset positive
earnings reports from U.S. banks.  
 The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 12.7815 at 12:06 p.m. New
York time, from 12.7743 yesterday. The peso has increased 2.4
percent in 2010, the second-best performer among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “We’re clearly in an environment where sentiment globally
is still very nervous about the sustainability of the
recovery,” said  Clyde Wardle , an emerging-market currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings PLC in New York.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent and oil
dropped 0.2 percent to $77.26 per barrel, erasing earlier gains.  
 Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. both reported profit
that beat analysts’ estimates today.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to an all-time low of
6.85 percent, according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the
security rose 0.21 centavo to 128.75 centavos per peso.  
 Francisco Diez , director of emerging-market trading at RBC
Capital Markets in New York, said Mexican government bonds’
inclusion in Citigroup Inc.’s World Government Bond Index in
October is fueling appetite abroad for higher-yielding Mexican
debt.  
 “There’s speculative interest from foreign accounts to buy
the longer-dated M bono bonds,” Diez said.
