             Brookfield Multiplex Group’s A$110
million ($97 million) settlement with about 120 individual and
institutional investors, who claimed they lost money because the
company failed to disclose losses at London’s Wembley Stadium,
was approved by the Federal Court of Australia.  
 Brookfield Multiplex, an Australian unit of Toronto-based
 Brookfield Asset Management Inc ., didn’t admit to any wrongdoing
in agreeing to settle the lawsuit, the company said in a
statement today.  
 “This is a major win for the investors,” Andrew Watson,
lawyer with Maurice Blackburn, who represented the plaintiffs,
said in a  statement  on the firm’s Web site.  
 The settlement is the third to surpass the A$100 million
level under Australia’s class-action regime and is about 20
times greater than the investors would have obtained under an
offer Brookfield Multiplex made in 2007, Maurice Blackburn said
in the statement.  
 The lawsuit was funded by Singapore-based International
Litigation Funding Partners, Maurice Blackburn said.  
 The investors sued in 2006, claiming Brookfield Multiplex
breached security disclosure requirements of the Australian
Stock Exchange and the country’s Corporations Act by failing to
disclose cost overruns and construction delays of the Wembley
Stadium, the West India Quay and the Brisbane Airport heavy
maintenance hangar, the lawfirm said.  
 Brookfield Multiplex shares slumped 58 percent from
February 2, 2005 to May 31, 2005, as the cost overruns and
delays were disclosed.
