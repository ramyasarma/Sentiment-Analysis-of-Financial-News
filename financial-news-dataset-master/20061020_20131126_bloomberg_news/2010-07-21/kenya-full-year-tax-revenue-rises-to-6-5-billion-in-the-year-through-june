             Kenya said tax collections for the
year through June rose 11 percent and missed the East African
nation’s target.  
 Revenue climbed to 534.4 billion shillings ($6.5 billion)
from 480.6 billion shillings a year earlier, the Kenya Revenue
Authority said on its website today. That’s below the target of
545.2 billion shillings, the Nairobi-based authority said.  
 “Under performance in imports, lower-than-expected oil
import volumes and a greater-than-expected decline in the price
of imports adversely affected customs revenues,”  Michael Waweru , head of the authority, said in the statement.  
 Consumption-based taxes dropped as the inflation rate
declined faster than forecast, Waweru said. Inflation slowed to
3.2 percent in June from 14 percent in July 2009, Kenya’s
National Bureau of Statistics said.  
 Customs revenues totaled to 193.7 billion shillings
compared with a target of 201.3 billion shillings, he said.  
 The tax revenue target in the financial year ending June
2011 is 641.2 billion shillings, he added.
