             Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA 
reached a standstill agreement with senior secured note holders,
gaining time for the Greek mobile phone operator’s second debt
restructuring in seven months.  
 Holders of 80.6 percent of its $1.2 billion euros ($1.58
billion) of floating-rate notes due 2012 agreed not to press
claims against the company, joining bank creditors who already
gave their assent, according to a statement. At the end of June,
Wind Hellas said it deferred a 17.5 million-euro payment on a
revolving credit line and that it would miss a 23 million-euro
interest payment on the notes.  
 Wind Hellas Chief Executive Officer  Nassos Zarkalis  noted
creditors’ support “for the steps we are taking to successfully
address the capital structure of the group on a long-term
basis.”  
 The phone operator’s business is being hurt by falling
consumer spending as Greece brings in austerity measures to ease
its budget crisis. Wind Hellas is owned by Egyptian billionaire
 Naguib Sawiris  through holding companies including Weather
Finance III Sarl, after he bought the company from
administrators a year ago.  
 The floating-rate notes were quoted at 33.5 cents on the
euro, up from as little as 29 cents on June 30, according to
HSBC Holdings Plc prices on Bloomberg.
