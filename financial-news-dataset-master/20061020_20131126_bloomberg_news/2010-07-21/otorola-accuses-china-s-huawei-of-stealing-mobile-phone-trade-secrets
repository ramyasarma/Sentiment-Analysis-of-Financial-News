             Motorola Inc.  sued Chinese rival
Huawei Technologies Co. for allegedly conspiring with former
employees of the U.S. maker of mobile phones and two-way radios
to steal trade secrets.  
 Huawei began receiving the information as early as 2001,
Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola claimed in an amended
lawsuit filed July 16 in federal court in Chicago. Huawei said
the complaint has no merit. Motorola originally sued five former
workers in 2008 for allegedly taking trade secrets with them
when they left to join Lemko Corp., which has a reseller
agreement with Huawei.  
 The suit comes as security concerns undermine Huawei and
ZTE Corp., China’s two biggest network-gear makers, in their
ability to expand in some markets. India blocked domestic phone
companies from buying equipment made by Chinese vendors, people
familiar with the matter said, and U.S. government concerns over
national security led Huawei to abandon a joint bid to buy 3Com
Corp. in 2008.  
 “Chinese equipment makers aiming to maintain growth are
increasingly forced to look at developed markets such as the U.S.
and Japan, where security concerns are the greatest,” said  Le Ping Huang , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“ZTE and especially privately-held Huawei have to make greater
efforts at increasing transparency and addressing these
issues.”  
 Recovered E-mail  
 In the amended complaint, Motorola claims a staff engineer
shared information about a new transceiver and other Motorola
technology with  Ren Zhengfei , the founder of Shenzhen, China-
based Huawei. Motorola said it has recovered e-mail showing
transmission of Motorola  product  specification documents marked
“confidential” to Huawei.  
 “The complaint is groundless and utterly without merit,”
Charlie Chen, Huawei’s senior vice president of North American
marketing, said in an e-mailed statement. “Huawei has no
relationship with Lemko, other than a reseller agreement. Huawei
will vigorously defend itself against baseless allegations.”  
 Motorola accused Huawei of civil conspiracy and
“threatened or actual” misappropriation of trade secrets and
demanded the return of all proprietary information and damages.  
 “Huawei and its officers knew they were receiving stolen
Motorola proprietary trade secrets and confidential information
without Motorola’s authorization and consent,” according to the
complaint.  
 The case is Motorola Inc. v. Lemko Corp., 08-cv-05427, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).
