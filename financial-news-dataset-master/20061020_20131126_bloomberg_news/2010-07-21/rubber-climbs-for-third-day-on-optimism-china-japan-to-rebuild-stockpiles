             Rubber retreated for the first time
in three days as a strengthening Japanese currency reduced the
appeal of the commodity used to make tires.  
 The most-active contract in Tokyo lost as much as 1.1
percent after gaining 0.8 percent in the past two sessions. The
yen gained versus 15 of its 16 major counterparts as concern
over the health of European banks and the pace of the U.S.
economic recovery boosted demand for the currency as a refuge.  
 The decline was limited because of optimism that demand may
grow, as stockpiles in Japan and China are at low levels, said
Avtar Sandu, Asian Commodities Manager at Phillip Futures Pte.  
 Natural-rubber  stockpiles  monitored by the Tokyo exchange
dropped by 29 percent to 1,341 metric tons as of July 10, data
from the bourse showed yesterday. It was the lowest volume since
at least 2001, said exchange spokesman Seiki Ichimura. Data
before that year were unavailable, he said.  
 December-delivery rubber fell as much as 2.8 yen to 261.7
yen per kilogram ($3,002 a ton) before settling at 263.5 yen on
the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. July-delivery rubber gained 2.2
percent to 352 yen, after declining 3 percent yesterday.  
 “Investors are optimistic Chinese and Japanese buyers will
soon build up their depleting stockpiles,” said  Chaiwat Muenmee ,
an analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS Futures Co.  
 “Rainfall in southern Thailand may limit supply
availability, providing support to rubber prices,” said Chaiwat.
Limited supply and a low level of stockpiles may make physical
delivery difficult at the expiry of the July contract.  
 Natural-rubber inventories in China have slumped 64 percent
this year to 21,374 tons, according to Bloomberg data.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 21,720 yuan ($3,204) a ton.  
 The cash price was quoted at 104.65 baht a kilogram,
unchanged from yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand said on its website.
