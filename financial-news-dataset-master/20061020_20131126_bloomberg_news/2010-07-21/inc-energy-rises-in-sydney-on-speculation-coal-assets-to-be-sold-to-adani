             Linc Energy Ltd. , which converts
coal into liquid fuels, rose to the highest in more than 11
weeks in Sydney amid speculation it’s close to selling
steelmaking coal assets in Australia to Adani Enterprises Ltd.  
 Linc advanced 18 percent to A$1.535 by the market’s 4:10 p.m.
close, the highest since April 30. The gain compares with a 0.2
percent increase in the benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index .  
 Adani is among three companies in talks to buy the Galilee
tenement, or permit, valued at more than A$1 billion ($880
million), Linc Chief Executive Officer  Peter Bond  said last week.
Adani raised $850 million overnight in the largest share sale to
institutional investors by an Indian company this year,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  
 “The share sale has heightened investors’ belief that Linc
will finally sell the Galilee coal property,” said  Chris Weston ,
head of institutional dealing at IG Markets in Melbourne.  
 Linc remains in talks with a number of parties, Brisbane-
based spokesman  Greg Meyer  said today. The company has been in
discussions to sell three non-core coal assets in Queensland
since 2008.  
 Adani, which is developing a 13,200-megawatt power plant in
India, is negotiating with a number of coal mine owners in the
country and overseas to secure fuel for the project, the company
said last week. Spokesman  Devendra Amin  couldn’t immediately be
reached at his office in Ahmedabad for comment today.
