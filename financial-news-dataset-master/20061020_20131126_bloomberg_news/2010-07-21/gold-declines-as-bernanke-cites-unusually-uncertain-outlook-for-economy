             Gold declined after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that “the economic outlook
remains unusually uncertain.”  
 “The Fed outlook is weighing on all assets,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“People fear that the U.S. is falling into a deflationary
spiral like Japan. They’re selling off everything, including
gold.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery dropped to $1,184.70 an
ounce at 4:35 p.m. in after-hours trading on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal rose 10 cents to $1,191.80 at the close
of floor trading. Gold for immediate delivery slipped $6.95 to
$1,185.10.  
 Bernanke made his comments to the Senate Banking Committee
today. U.S. equities fell and the  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of
19 commodities pared earlier gains. Gold is still up 8.1 percent
this year.
