             Royal Dutch Shell Plc  said it’s in
exclusive talks with Vitol Group and Helios Investment Partners
LLP over its planned sale of interests in 19 African retail and
distribution units.  
 “Under the terms of the proposed deal, which would see the
Shell brand and products remain in each country, Vitol and
Helios would become the majority shareholders in the businesses,
with Shell retaining a shareholding,” Shell Oil Products said
in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Shell said in April it’s reviewing its downstream
businesses in 21 African countries and other regions to focus on
fewer, larger markets. The businesses under review in Africa are
profitable,  Shell  said at the time. The countries include
Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Togo, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana
and Namibia among others.  
 “We’re talking about 1,350 retail sites and about 2,000
staff members,” Dennis Matsane, a spokesman for Shell, said by
mobile phone in Johannesburg today, declining to disclose the
potential deal value. Shell’s fuels, lubricants, refining and
liquefied petroleum gas businesses in South Africa are not part
of the deal, according to the statement.
