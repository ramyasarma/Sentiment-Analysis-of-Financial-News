             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s only campaign debate with Liberal-National opposition
leader  Tony Abbott  has been rescheduled to avoid clashing with
the final of the popular cooking show  MasterChef .  
 The debate was moved to 6:30 p.m. on July 25, the National
Press Club said in an e-mailed statement. The one-hour debate
was originally to start an hour later, the same time as Ten
Network’s broadcast of the knock-out cooking competition. Last
year’s final set a ratings record when almost one in five
Australians tuned in to watch.  
 “It says something about the stuff of real life,” Gillard
told Sydney radio 2UE today when asked about the changed time.
“People care about who the prime minister and who the
government is, but people are also pretty keen about what’s on
the dinner table.”  
 Twenty-four contestants were chosen in April from 8,000
applicants for the second season of MasterChef, an adaptation of
the BBC reality show. They have faced 14 weeks of cooking
challenges, broadcast on  Ten Network Holdings Ltd.  six nights a
week. About 4.1 million viewers watched last year’s finale.  
 The ruling Labor party leads the opposition Liberal-
National coalition by 10 percentage points with 55 percent of
voters preferring Gillard, up from a 53 to 47 percent split
three weeks ago after she ousted  Kevin Rudd , a Newspoll
published in the Australian newspaper on July 19 showed. The
margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points.
