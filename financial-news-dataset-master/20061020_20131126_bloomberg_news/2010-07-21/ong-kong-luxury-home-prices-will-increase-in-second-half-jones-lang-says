             The value of Hong Kong luxury homes
may gain 10 percent in the second half as the outcome of next
week’s  auction  of a building site in the Peak area could bolster
investors’ sentiment, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.   
 Luxury home prices, which rose 10 percent in the first half,
will be supported by low interest rates, the lack of new supply
and strong economic fundamentals, Joseph Tsang, the Hong Kong-
based head of capital market at Jones Lang, said at a briefing
today.  
 The prediction may counter Hong Kong government efforts to
curb a 38 percent  surge  in home prices since the beginning of
2009 amid concerns housing is becoming unaffordable. The
authorities have introduced rules on new home sales and are
investigating canceled sales at a  Henderson Land Development Co. 
luxury apartment project.  
 “Buyers here have already digested most negative news from
the global economy,” Tsang said. “Barring another catastrophic
event in the financial market, we expect the Hong Kong home
market to continue staying strong.”  
 Luxury homes are those at least 1,000 square feet (93
square meters) or costing at least HK$10 million ($1.3 million).  
 The Hong Kong government is auctioning a site in Mount
Nicholson on the Peak, the city’s most expensive residential
area, on July 28. Analysts are predicting the site will fetch
from HK$25,000 to HK$30,000 a square foot, Tsang said.  
 Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the world’s biggest developer
by market value, last week sold all 92 flats it offered at a
luxury project in the Island South district in one day.
