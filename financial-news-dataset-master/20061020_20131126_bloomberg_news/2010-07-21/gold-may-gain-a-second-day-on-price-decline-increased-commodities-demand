             Gold, little changed in New York,
may fall as some investors sell the metal following a worldwide
rally in equities and commodities.  
 Gold is headed for the first monthly loss since March as
worldwide equities rebound and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
eases. The metal has dropped as much as 7.2 percent from a
record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 “Gold is struggling to go higher,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The currency
markets have stabilized, so we’re not seeing that flight out of
currencies into gold. Investors have more appetite for risk than
fear.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery fell 60 cents to $1,191.10
an ounce at 11:29 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Before today,
the metal gained 8.7 percent this year.  
 Stocks in Asia and Europe gained and the Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 commodities climbed as much as 0.8 percent. The
MSCI World Index of equities had three consecutive monthly
losses.  
 “Traders are currently focusing on tracking risk appetite
and keeping an eye on slowing investment flows into gold as the
euro-centric crisis appears to be dissipating,” said  Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, dropped 0.5 percent yesterday to
1,308.13 metric tons, the biggest decline since early February.  
 Precious metals with wider industrial applications rose on
speculation that demand for raw materials will increase at the
global economy recovers.  
 Silver futures for September gained 5.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $17.745 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $9.20, or 0.6
percent, to $1,527 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 50 cents
to $451.55 an ounce, also on Nymex.
