             Venezuela will try eight bankers and
the country’s former securities chief on charges related to the
misuse of depositor funds, the  Attorney General’s  office said.  
 Arne Chacon  and Miguel Vaz of Banco Real Banco de
Desarrollo face charges of exploiting depositors, while Orlando
Suarez Contramaestre, Luis Suarez Montenegro and Milagros Vivas
Moncayo face charges of acting as accomplices, the attorney
general said in a statement sent by e-mail last night. Antonio
Marquez, a former securities regulator, will also face charges
of complicity.  
 Ricardo Fernandez Barrueco, who owned four banks taken over
by the government, and Jose Camacho Uzcategui were charged with
alleged complicity in appropriating and deviating depositors’
money and undue approval of loans. Caribay Camacho de Castro,
Camacho Uzcategui’s daughter, will face trial for complicity in
the deviation of depositors’ money. All nine people headed to
trial face the charge of association with delinquency, the
statement said. All will remain in jail until their trials.  
 Venezuela has closed more than 12 lenders since November,
after speculation of insolvency led to withdrawals and President
 Hugo Chavez  threatened to nationalize the industry. The
government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40
warrants for others who fled the country on charges of diversion
of deposits and failing to prove the origin of some funds.
