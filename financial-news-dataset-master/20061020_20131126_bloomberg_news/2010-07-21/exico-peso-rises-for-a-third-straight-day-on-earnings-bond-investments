             Mexico’s peso gained for a third day
as U.S. companies beat analysts’ earnings estimates and foreign
investors continued to buy peso bonds.  
 The peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.7455 per U.S. dollar at
9:08 a.m. New York time, from 12.7743 yesterday. The peso has
increased 2.7 percent in 2010, the second-best performer among
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “There’s speculative interest from foreign accounts to buy
the longer-dated M bono bonds,” said  Francisco Diez , director
of emerging-market trading at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
“The bond purchases help the peso because you have to convert
dollars into pesos, so as yields move lower with foreigners
buying bonds, the peso strengthens.”  
 Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. reported profit that
beat analysts’ estimates. Oil rose 1.3 percent to $78.43 per
barrel.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to an all-time low of
6.86 percent, according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the
security rose 0.11 centavo to 128.64 centavos per peso.
