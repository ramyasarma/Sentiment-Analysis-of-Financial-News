             Telstra Corp. , Australia’s largest
telephone company, will cut about 10 percent of its executive
jobs as the company seeks to simplify its business.  
 The changes will involve about 30 executives losing their
positions while a further 300 senior management roles will be
eliminated, spokeswoman Julia Foley said in an e-mailed
statement today. None of the jobs cut report directly to Chief
Executive Officer  David Thodey  or involve employees who deal
with customers, the company said.  
 Since taking charge 14 months ago, Thodey has pledged to
improve customer service and cut bureaucracy to create a more
flexible culture at the former government-owned monopoly. Last
year he froze salaries for the Melbourne-based company’s top 200
executives and capped most other pay increases at 2 percent.  
 “These changes are about making our business simpler,
removing duplication and increasing the speed of decision-
making,” Telstra said in the statement. “All of the changes
are intended to make processes simpler for our front-line
staff.”  
 In March, Thodey reshuffled his executive team, in a move
he said would align Telstra’s leadership structure with its
business goals. The moves included creating roles such as chief
marketing officer and head of customer experience.  
 The company is Australia’s biggest provider of fixed-line
phone, mobile and Internet services and employs more than 43,000
people.
