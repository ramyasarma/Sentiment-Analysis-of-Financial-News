             Crude oil fell for a second day in
New York as an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories bolstered
speculation demand from the world’s biggest oil-consuming nation
is slowing.  
 Oil dropped as much as 0.5 percent after an Energy
Department report showed crude stockpiles climbed 360,000
barrels to 353.5 million last week, compared with analysts’
predictions of a drawdown. Gasoline and distillate fuel supplies
also rose. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday the economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 “It’s been a volatile period over the past few months and
we’ve seen the global growth outlook questioned in many quarters
with sources of uncertainty evident,”  Toby Hassall , a commodity
analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney, said by telephone.
“A set of bearish Energy Department numbers added to the
selling pressure.”  
 Crude for September delivery fell as much as 40 cents to
$76.16 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was at $76.20 at 2:37 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, the contract dropped $1.02 to $76.56. Futures have
lost 4 percent this year.  
 Bernanke said the Fed’s “somewhat weaker outlook” is due
in part to financial markets that “have become less supportive
of economic growth in recent months.” The Fed is prepared to
act as needed to aid growth, he said.  
 Commercially held U.S. crude inventories were  forecast  to
drop 1.2 million barrels, according to the median estimate from
17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Refinery Operations  
 Refiners raised average  utilization  by 1 percentage point
to 91.5 percent of capacity, the highest rate since August 2007,
according to the Energy Department’s report.  
 “Until we see a recovery in the health of the consumer,
there is little point in running crude oil through refineries if
the products will only stockpile and cause a mini bubble in the
short term,”  Stephen Schork , president of consultant Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note.  
 Oil stockpiles held at  Cushing , Oklahoma, where New York-
traded West Texas Intermediate grade is delivered, rose 985,000
barrels to 37.1 million, the largest increase since April, the
report showed. Crude imports increased 7.5 percent to 9.98
million barrels a day, the biggest one-week gain in three months.  
 Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.12 million barrels to 222.2
million even as  production  slipped, the Energy Department said.
Distillate fuel supplies, including heating oil and diesel, rose
3.94 million barrels to 166.6 million, the biggest increase
since the week to Jan. 9, 2009.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange dropped as much as 46 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $74.91 a barrel. It was at $75 at 2:37 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract fell 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
end yesterday’s session at $75.37.
