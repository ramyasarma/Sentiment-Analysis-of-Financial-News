             Copper prices rose the most in five
weeks after Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s
biggest publicly traded producer, said the metal’s outlook is
“positive.”  
 Physical markets for copper “are really stronger than
economic indicators in the U.S.,” Freeport Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Adkerson  said today. The company reported
second-quarter profit that topped analyst estimates. Prices have
dropped 7.6 percent this year on concern that slowing economic
growth would erode demand.  
 “We feel very, very positive about copper,” Adkerson said
on a call with investors. “Our order books are filling up more
strongly than they have in some time.”  
 Futures for September delivery rose 9.15 cents, or 3
percent, to $3.093 a pound on the Comex in New York. That’s the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 14.  
 Prices also climbed as copper  stockpiles  tracked by the
London Metal Exchange shrank for a 24th straight session, the
longest slide since July 2, 2009. Supplies are down 9.2 percent
since June 17 to 417,625 metric tons.  
 “The overall drawdown in stocks is foretelling of a better
demand outlook,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  
 Copper for delivery in three months added $219, or 3.3
percent, to $6,860 a ton ($3.11 a pound) on the LME.  
 Also on the LME, aluminum, nickel, tin, zinc and lead
prices rose.
