             An Ivory Coast court has delayed
sentencing three journalists detained for publishing an article
about a report on corruption in the nation’s cocoa industry.  
 “We haven’t been informed as to the reasons why but the
sentencing has been adjourned until July 26,” Tiebi Hivat, a
lawyer for the journalists, said in an interview by phone from
the commercial capital, Abidjan, today. The judge is seeking a
minimum five-year jail term, he said.  
 The editor, publisher and managing editor of Abidjan-
based Le Nouveau Courrier were arrested on July 14 on the orders
of Abidjan Public Prosecutor Raymond Tchimou. The story,
published on the day of their arrest, disclosed the results of
the probe ordered by President  Laurent Gbagbo  after 23 senior
employees of cocoa agencies were charged with fraud and
embezzlement in June 2008. The West African nation is the
world’s biggest producer of the chocolate-making ingredient.  
 The three journalists, two Ivorians and one with dual
nationality with France, were tried for theft of administrative
documents, Desire Me Gueu, their lawyer, said by phone.  
 The three were transferred to Abidjan Correctional House,
the country’s main prison in Abidjan, on July 16, he said. Under
Ivorian law, journalists cannot be imprisoned for the content of
their articles.
