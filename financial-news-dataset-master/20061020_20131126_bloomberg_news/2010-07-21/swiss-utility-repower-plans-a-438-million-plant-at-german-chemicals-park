             Repower AG , a Swiss utility, plans
to build a combined-cycle 340 million-euro ($438 million) power
plant at a chemical production site in Leverkusen, Germany.  
 The 430-megawatt natural gas-fueled facility is scheduled
to start in 2014 and will be run by  Currenta GmbH & Co. OHG , a
joint venture between  Bayer AG  and  Lanxess AG , Repower said in a
statement today. Poschiavo, Switzerland-based Repower will be
the owner of the generator.  
 The plant will supply steam for other chemical factories in
the area and the combined heat and power production means that
it will have fuel efficiency of more than 80 percent, Repower
said. It will contribute to Germany’s goal of raising the share
of such power output to 25 percent by 2020, Repower said.  
 The company is preparing documentation for the approval
process, according to the statement.
