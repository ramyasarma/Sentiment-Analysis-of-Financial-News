             Former Australian Prime Minister
Kevin Rudd is being considered for a climate change advisory
role with the United Nations, the Daily Telegraph reported,
citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the plan. No
date has been set for the creation of the role, giving
flexibility to Rudd who is currently campaigning for reelection
to parliament in next month’s federal election, the newspaper
said. Spokespeople for Rudd and the UN declined to comment, the
Telegraph reported.
