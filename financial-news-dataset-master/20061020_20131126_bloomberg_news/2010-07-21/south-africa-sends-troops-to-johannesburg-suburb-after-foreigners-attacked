             South Africa sent troops into Kya
Sand, a suburb of Johannesburg, to prevent an escalation in
recent attacks that may have targeted foreigners, police
spokesman Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said.  
 The deployment of army and police reinforcements came after
10 people were arrested for assaulting and robbing 11 people,
six of whom were Zimbabwean or Mozambican, Mariemuthoo said by
phone from Johannesburg today. Three of the victims needed
hospital treatment, he said.  
 “We’re not saying it’s xenophobia, because South Africans
were also victims there,” Mariemuthoo said. “We’re treating it
as criminal acts.”  
 After human rights groups reported threats against
foreigners living in South Africa toward the end of the soccer
World Cup on July 11, the government has sought to quell fears
of a repeat of xenophobic violence that left more than 60 people
dead in May 2008.
