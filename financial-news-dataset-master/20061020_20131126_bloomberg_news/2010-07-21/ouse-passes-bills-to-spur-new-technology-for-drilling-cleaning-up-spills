             The U.S. House of Representatives
passed measures to develop new technologies for deepwater
drilling and cleaning up oil spills, the first legislation
inspired by the BP Plc disaster to reach a floor vote.  
 One bill, passed on a voice vote today, aims to speed up
the use of new ways to limit the damage from oil spills and aid
the cleanup. Lawmakers said the booms and skiffs BP is using
after the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico are
the same as units employed in 1989 after the Exxon Valdez tanker
crashed off the coast of Alaska.  
 “We heard time and again the technology they were using
was inadequate,” Representative  Lynn Woolsey , a California
Democrat, said in floor debate, commenting on hearings the House
Science & Technology Committee held in response to the Gulf
spill.  
 BP is struggling to contain its damaged well after the
Deepwater Horizon rig blew out April 20, killing 11 workers. The
oil flow has been temporarily stopped by a cap, after spewing as
many as 60,000 barrels a day, according to government estimates.  
 The House also passed on a voice vote a second BP-related
bill, to fund research and development for safer oil and gas
drilling at the Department of Energy.
