             Murphy Oil Corp. said a power
failure at its  Milford Haven  oil refinery in Wales led to a fire
at the site.  
 A disruption to the external power supply at about 11:55
p.m. local time yesterday “caused a total power failure at the
Milford Haven refinery, resulting in a fire within the refinery
process units,” the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. “There was no loss of product.”  
 The blaze broke out in a processing unit just after
midnight and was put out a “short while later” by the fire
service, the Dyfed-Powys Police said in an e-mail. The specific
unit wasn’t identified. No injuries were reported.  
 The 108,000-barrel-a-day refinery was shut down for
maintenance earlier this year. Work included a capacity increase
to about 130,000 barrels of oil a day.
