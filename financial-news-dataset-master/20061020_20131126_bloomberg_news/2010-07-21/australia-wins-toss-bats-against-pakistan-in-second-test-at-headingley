             Australia won the toss and decided
to bat first against Pakistan in the second cricket Test at
Headingley, Leeds.  
 The Australians were 14-0 after four overs. They won the
first match in the two-game series by 150 runs.  
 The matches are being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.  
 Pakistan: Salman Butt (captain), Imran Farhat, Azhar Ali, Umar
Akmal, Umar Amin, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Mohammad Aamer,
Umar Gul, Danish Kaneria, Mohammad Asif.
