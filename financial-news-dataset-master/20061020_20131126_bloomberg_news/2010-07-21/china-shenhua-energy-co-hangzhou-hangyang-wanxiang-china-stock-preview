             China’s stocks  rose for a fourth day,
posting their longest stretch of gains since February, on
speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the government
to relax property curbs and allow for more bank lending.  
 Angang Steel Co.  led advances for steelmakers after the
stock was upgraded by Standard Chartered Bank Plc. China Vanke
Co. rose the most in almost two weeks after the biggest listed
property developer was rated “buy” in new coverage by
Citigroup Inc.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  added 1.5 percent on
the prospect looser monetary policies would spur metal demand.  
 “Easing monetary policies is a big possibility,” said
 Zheng Tuo , president of Shanghai Good Hope Equity Investment
Management Co. “That’s probably what the government would start
to do to counter the economic slowdown.”  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  climbed 27.01, or 1.1 percent,
to 2,562.41 at the close, the highest since June 24. The four-
day stretch of gains is the longest since the period ended Feb.
12. The CSI 300 Index rose 1.2 percent to 2,781.29.  
 The Shanghai index has advanced 5.7 percent this week, set
for the biggest  weekly gain  since Dec. 4, on expectations the
government will ease tightening measures and boost investment in
low-income housing to counter a slowdown in economic growth.  
 The central bank has raised banks’ reserve requirements
three times this year and the government boosted down payments
and mortgage rates for multiple-purchases of homes to curb
record lending growth and asset bubbles. The Shanghai index has
fallen 22 percent this year on concern measures to control real-
estate speculation and rising consumer prices will damp earnings.  
 Citigroup today lowered its full-year global growth
forecasts for 2010 and 2011, according to a strategy report. It
also cut its outlook for both years’ growth in the U.S., China
and emerging markets, the report showed.  
 Policy Outlook  
 China’s GDP growth forecast was cut by 1 percentage point
to 9.5 percent, Citigroup’s biggest one-month cut in the
country’s outlook since late 2001, the report said. The bank
said China would grow at an 8.8 percent rate next year, 0.5
percentage points lower than previously forecast.  
 “What the market is betting now is that the government
will allow the current tightening measures to be relaxed going
forward,” said  Sun Chao , an analyst at Citic Securities Co. in
Shanghai.  
 Deutsche Bank AG economist  Jun Ma  said the government may
only relax its policy tightening measures in the fourth quarter
after worsening economic data in the next two to three months.  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter and industrial production cooled more than
forecast in June. Policy makers may loosen some real-estate
curbs and approve more infrastructure and investment projects in
the fourth quarter as growth slows toward 7 percent before
picking up into 2011, Stephen Green, head of China research for
Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai, said July 15.  
 Steelmakers Rally  
 Ma, the top-ranked economist in Institutional Investor’s
2010 All-China poll, also said a pull-back in Chinese stocks is
likely and investors should consider waiting for a “safer”
entry point.  
 Angang Steel added 2.8 percent to 8.39 yuan. The stock was
upgraded by Standard Chartered Bank analysts  Wei Ouyang  and Yan
Chen, who cited a possible earnings recovery in the fourth
quarter amid lower iron ore contract prices.  
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. , the listed unit of China’s
second-biggest steelmaker, gained 0.6 percent to 6.30 yuan.
Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of the biggest
steelmaker, rose 1 percent to 4.06 yuan.  
 The average spot price for domestic hot-rolled steel sheet
yesterday climbed 2.1 percent to the highest since June 30, data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. showed.  
 Bond Signals  
 Aluminum Corp. of China, the listed unit of nation’s
biggest maker of the lightweight metal, rose 1.5 percent to 9.54
yuan. Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co., China’s biggest producer of
refined zinc, advanced 3.1 percent to 9.61 yuan.  
 A gauge of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite gained
1.3 percent. Vanke rose 2.6 percent to 7.95 yuan after Citigroup
said the “restructured, refocused” company is already
delivering “notably improved” growth momentum.  Poly Real
Estate Group Co.  rose 4.5 percent to 12.35 yuan.  
 China bond investors are betting government measures to
cool property prices won’t hurt real estate companies as money
managers and economists warn of a crash that may slow the
economy leading global growth.  
 Yields on China developers’ local-currency notes fell to
the lowest ever relative to government debt this year, with the
spread on Poly Real Estate’s 4.3 billion yuan ($634 million) in
7 percent bonds due 2013 narrowing to a record 95 basis points
on July 8, according to Shanghai Stock Exchange prices on
Bloomberg. The spread tightened by 68 basis points to 138 basis
points since the end of 2009.  
 Property Tax  
 China plans to start implementing a property tax in 2012 on
a trial basis, the 163.com website run by Netease said in a
report today, citing a finance ministry meeting in Beijing.  
 The issue will be one of the ministry’s top tasks in 2012,
the report said, without citing any official by name. Due to the
difficulties of implementing such a levy nationwide, the tax may
be rolled out first in a few cities, the report said without
naming them.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
 CSG Holding Co.  (000012 CH) rose 3.1 percent to 11.85 yuan,
the highest since May 28. The glassmaker said first-half net
income increased 144 percent from a year earlier to 636 million
yuan.  
 Wanxiang Qianchao Co.  (000559 CH), the listed unit of
China’s largest auto-parts maker, climbed 5.4 percent to 11.59
yuan, the most since June 9. The company said first-half net
income probably increased 91 percent from a year earlier.  
 Xiamen Tungsten Co.  (600549 CH) added 3.1 percent to 20.34
yuan after announcing its first-half profit surged 1,276 percent
from a year ago.  
 Your-Mart Co.  (002277 CH) jumped 6.8 percent to 22.36 yuan,
the highest price since the stock began trading July 2009.
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. raised the retailer’s earnings
forecast for 2010 by 6.8 percent to 0.63 yuan and that for 2011
by 11 percent to 0.84 yuan, analysts  Jin Zefei  and  Zhou Jiamin 
wrote in a report today, citing increasing purchasing power in
southern Hunan province.
