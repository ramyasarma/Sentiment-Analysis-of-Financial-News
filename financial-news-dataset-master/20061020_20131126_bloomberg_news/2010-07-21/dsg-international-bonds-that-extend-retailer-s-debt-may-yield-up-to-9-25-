             DSG International Plc ’s sale of
five-year junk bonds may be priced to yield 9 percent to 9.25
percent, as the U.K.’s biggest electronics retailer seeks to
extend the maturity of its debt.  
 DSG plans to sell up 150 million pounds ($230 million) of
five-year bonds, depending on the results of a buyback offer for
existing shorter-dated bonds that’s due July 23, according to
bankers involved in the transaction. The Hemel Hempstead,
England-based company, which owns the Dixons and Curry’s
appliance-shop brands, offered July 15 to repurchase as much as
140 million pounds of its 6.125 percent bonds due in 2012.  
 DSG’s buyback and new issue follows bond tenders from
companies including Veolia Environnement SA, the world’s biggest
water utility, and cigarette maker British American Tobacco Plc.  
 The average yield investors demand to hold junk, or high-
yield, bonds fell to 9.3 percent, the lowest in more than two
months and down from 27.8 percent in March 2009, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. DSG is  rated  Ba3 by
Moody’s Investors Service, three steps below investment grade,
and one level lower at B+ by Fitch Ratings.  
 From September, DSG will be known as Dixons Retail Plc, it
said in a June 24 statement.  
 Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing
the retailer’s bond sale, said the bankers.
