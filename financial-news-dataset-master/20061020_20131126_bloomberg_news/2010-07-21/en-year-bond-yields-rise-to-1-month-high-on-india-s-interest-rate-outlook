             India’s benchmark 10-year  bonds  fell,
pushing their yield to the highest level in a month, on
speculation the  central bank  will next week add to this year’s
three interest-rate  increases  to help combat inflation.  
 Yields rose for a second day after Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said yesterday  inflation , which has exceeded 10
percent for the last five months, was a matter of concern and no
longer confined to food items alone. The Reserve Bank of India
announced an unscheduled increase in interest rates on July 2
and next meets to review borrowing costs on July 27.  
 “Inflation has to be brought down if you want to sustain
robust economic growth,” said Killol Pandya, who manages the
equivalent of $152 million of local debt at Shinsei Asset
Management in Mumbai. “Interest rates and yields have to move
up further.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.68 percent as of
10:28 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate earlier reached 7.69 percent, the highest level
since June 14. The price fell 0.12, or 12 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 100.78.  
 Pandya said the Reserve Bank of India may raise its
benchmark interest rates by another 50 to 75 basis points in
2010. The reverse repurchase  rate  of 4 percent and the
repurchase  rate  of 5.5 percent are both 75 basis points higher
than they were at the start of the year.  
 Wholesale prices rose 10.6 percent from a year earlier in
June, following a 10.2 gain in May, official figures show.
April’s 11.2 percent increase was the biggest since September
2008.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps in India, derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, touched
the highest level today since November 2008. The fixed payment
made to receive a floating rate rose four basis points to 5.92
percent.
