             Cocoa fell for a third day as
speculators sold futures after last week’s rally lifted prices
beyond levels supported by the outlook for supply and demand.
Coffee also dropped.  
 In the week ended July 13,  net-long positions  held by
hedge-fund managers and other large speculators in New York
cocoa futures dropped for the first time in three weeks. Cocoa
reached a 10-week high on July 16.  
 “Speculative froth is leaving the market,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst with Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by
telephone. Last week’s 5.6 percent rally was “largely
speculator driven,” he said.  
 Cocoa for September delivery fell $42, or 1.4 percent, to
$2,935 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. The price has dropped
7.3 percent this week.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, the September futures contract
slid 33 pounds, or 1.4 percent, to 2,286 pounds ($3,466) a ton,
after sliding to 2,280 pounds, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since May 21.  
 London-traded cocoa has gained 25 percent in the past year,
partly on forecasts for higher demand as the global economy
recovers.  
 Beans from Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world’s largest
growers, are heading for warehouses in Europe, possibly easing a
shortage that drove prices higher, said Andreas Christiansen,
the managing director at supplier Hamburg Cocoa and Commodity
Office GmbH in the German city.  
 Arabica-coffee for September delivery slipped 1.25 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $1.573 a pound in New York. In London,
robusta-coffee futures for September delivery fell $12, or 0.7
percent, to $1,672 a ton.
