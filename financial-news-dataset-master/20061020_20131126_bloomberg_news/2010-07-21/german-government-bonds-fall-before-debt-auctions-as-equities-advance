             German 30-year bond yields were near
the highest in more than three weeks after a sale of the
securities failed to attract enough bids to cover the 4 billion
euros ($5.1 billion) offered.  
 Ten-year bund yields were little changed as better-than-
estimated earnings from  Apple Inc.  and Fiat SpA pushed the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  up 1.4 percent, curbing demand for the safety
of fixed income. Total bids at today’s auction of 3.25 percent,
30-year bonds were 3.764 billion euros, and the Bundesbank
retained 805 million euros of the offering, giving the sale a
so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.2. Irish, Spanish and
Portuguese 10-year yields fell relative to bund yields.  
 “New 30-year paper with a 3.25 percent coupon is hard to
consider taking down for a long-term investment,” said  Peter Chatwell , an interest-rate strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Peripheral spreads are
narrower, which is encouraging as it suggests solid demand for
high-yielders.”  
 Thirty-year German bond yields rose one basis point to 3.35
percent as of 3:43 p.m. in London. The 3.25 percent security due
July 2042 fell 0.06, or 60 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 98.15. The yield reached 3.38 percent on July 15, the
most since June 28. Ten-year yields were little changed at 2.64
percent. The two-year note yield fell four basis points to 0.74
percent.  
 ‘Extremely Low Yield’  
 German government bonds have returned 6.5 percent this
year, compared with 6.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 6
percent for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  
 The Federal Finance Agency attributed the auction result to
an “extremely low yield.” The average yield of 3.33 percent is
the lowest that the agency ever had for bond of this maturity,
according to  Joerg Mueller , a spokesman at the agency.  
 “It is important in considering today’s results to
remember that at present we have an extremely low yield level,”
Mueller said in an e-mail. It “is the lowest average yield
level that we have ever had for a bond of this maturity,” he
said. “With regards to the under-subscription, the Finance
Agency sees no fundamental problem.”  
 Auction History  
 The bond’s low yield and the potential for losses may have
damped investor demand for the auction, according to Bayerische
Landesbank.  
 “This is a bit bad, rather than very bad, as the retained
share will be going to the market later on,” said  Marius Daheim , a senior fixed-income strategist in Munich. “It has not
failed for reasons of creditworthiness like Greece, but because
yields are extremely low, and anyone who buys it will probably
have to take a loss not far down the road.”  
 There have been four occasions over the past four years
where German 30-year bond sales garnered bids below the amount
of securities on offer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
At the previous auction on April 21, investors bid for 2.752
billion euros worth of a 3 billion-euro offering. The finance
agency received 3.94 billion euros worth of bids at a 4-billion-
euro sale in July 2008, and 5.59 billion euros of bids at a 6-
billion-euro sale in January 2007.  
 Before that, the last incident was a January 2000 sale of 5
billion euros of bonds that garnered bids for 3.8 billion euros.  
 Irish, Spanish Premiums  
 Germany’s sale of 30-year bonds was its last at that
maturity this year. It replaces the 4.75 percent 2040 bond as
the new 30-year benchmark.  
 The premium that investors demand to hold  Irish 10-year 
government bonds over benchmark German bunds narrowed one basis
point to 276 basis points. The so-called yield spread between
Spanish and German 10-year bonds dropped two basis points to 167
basis points. It was at 207 basis points on July 14. The
 Portuguese-German spread  was two basis points tighter at 281
basis points.  
 Portugal sold 1.253 billion euros of bills due in July 2011
at an average yield of 2.452 percent, the country’s debt
management agency said today. That compares with an average
yield of 1.036 percent at a March 17 auction of 12-month bills
due in March 2011, before the region’s sovereign-debt crisis had
worsened.  
 Today’s Portuguese auction attracted bids for 1.3 times the
amount offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.2 in the
March auction. The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on July 15
said the indicative amount for today’s auction was 1.25 billion
euros.  
 “It was a pretty reasonable auction,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income strategist at Barclays Capital in
London. It’s “not an unsustainable level to pay for its debt.”
