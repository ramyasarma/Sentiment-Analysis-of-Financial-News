             Foster’s Group Ltd. is targeting
A$84 million in Australian wine earnings before interest and tax
in 2011 after changing the name of the unit to Treasury Wine
Estates, the Australian Financial Review reported. The profit
for the 12 months ending June 2011 is the group’s “number one
priority” and compares to A$37 million in earnings posted in
the December half of fiscal 2010, the newspaper said, citing
division head David Dearie.
