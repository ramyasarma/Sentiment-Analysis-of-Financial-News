Gedeon Richter Nyrt. , Hungary’s
largest drugmaker, acquired Grunenthal GmbH’s contraceptive
portfolio for 236.5 million euros ($331 million).  Richter acquired distribution and marketing rights for the
Aachen, Germany-based Grunenthal’s oral contraceptive portfolio
worldwide excluding Latin America, Richter said in a statement
posted on the  website  of the Budapest bourse today.  Richter, which makes the Plan B morning-after contraceptive
pill, purchased Switzerland’s PregLem Holding SA in October as
the Budapest-based company seeks to widen the range of its
products.  Grunenthal, which is an independent, family-owned research
pharmaceutical company, reported revenue from oral
contraceptives, excluding Latin America, of 72 million euros in
2009, according to the statement.  Richter  shares  advanced as much as 845 forint, or 1.8
percent, to 47,445 forint, the highest since Oct. 25. Richter
has gained 18.3 percent over the past year, compared with a 18.8
percent rise in the benchmark  BUX Index .  Richter expects to close the transaction, which is subject
to approval from German antitrust authorities, in December, the
statement said. The transfer of technology will be completed by
late 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
