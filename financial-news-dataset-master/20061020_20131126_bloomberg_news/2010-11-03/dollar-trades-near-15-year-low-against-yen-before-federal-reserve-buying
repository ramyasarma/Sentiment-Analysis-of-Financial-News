The dollar fell against higher-
yielding currencies amid speculation the Federal Reserve will
restart purchases of bonds today to spur the economy, increasing
the supply of the U.S. currency in circulation.  The dollar rose from near a 15-year low against the yen and
erased a loss versus the euro as a private-sector report showed
U.S. companies boosted payrolls more than forecast last month.
It dropped against emerging-market currencies including South
Korea’s won and Brazil’s real as gains in stocks gave investors
the confidence to buy higher-yielding assets. The Fed may pledge
to buy $500 billion or more in securities, according to 29 of 56
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “All eyes are on the Fed today, and that’s probably going
to be the main driver,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “If
they surprise on the dovish side, that could add extra fuel” to
the dollar weakness, he said.  The dollar was little changed at $1.4027 per euro at 8:33
a.m. in New York, from $1.4034 yesterday, when it depreciated to
$1.4058, the weakest level since Oct. 25. It rose 0.3 percent to
80.88 yen, from 80.63 yesterday. It reached 80.22 on Nov. 1, the
weakest level since April 1995. The yen traded at 113.46 per
euro, from 113.15 yesterday.  The greenback erased an earlier loss versus the euro after
ADP Employer Services reported employment increased by 43,000 in
October. The median estimate of 38 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 20,000 gain.  ‘Picking Up Pace’  “We’ve seen a score of upside U.S. surprises, confirming a
much bigger global story that the recovery is picking up pace
into the end of the year, much to the surprise of a lot of
people,” said  Boris Schlossberg , director of research at online
currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “Everything pre-QE is
going to be relatively contained, and then this afternoon we’ll
see where it goes.”  The MSCI World Index of shares rose for a fifth day,
gaining 0.2 percent. U.S. stock-index futures rose.  Benchmark interest rates are 2.25 percent in South Korea
and 10.75 percent in Brazil, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, making the nations’ higher-yielding assets
attractive to investors.  The dollar dropped for a third day against the won,
depreciating 0.3 percent to 1,110.28. Against the real, the
greenback declined 0.8 percent to 1.6898. South Korea’s currency
rose 0.4 percent to 13.7357 against the yen.  Fed Efforts  The Fed has kept U.S.  interest rates  near zero since
December 2008 and used asset purchases to try to stimulate
growth following the worst recession since the Depression. New
asset purchases to stoke the recovery and boost prices would
follow Fed acquisitions of $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and
mortgage debt that ended in March.  The Washington-based central bank’s preferred price
measure, which excludes food and fuel, rose 1.2 percent in
September from a year earlier, the smallest gain since September
2001.  Most Fed officials’  long-term preferred range for the
inflation rate is about 1.7 percent to 2 percent.  The pound gained versus the dollar and the euro after a
report showed U.K. services growth unexpectedly accelerated in
October. The pound rose 0.6 percent to $1.6139 and appreciated
to 87 pence per euro, from 87.48 pence yesterday.  The  services gauge  rose to 53.2 from 52.8 in September,
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply said today. Economists forecast a decline to 52.6,
according to the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  Australian Dollar  The Australian dollar retreated from near parity with its
U.S. counterpart as the country’s Bureau of Statistics said
home-building approvals fell 6.6 percent in September from a
month earlier, compared with the median economist forecast for
no change in a Bloomberg News survey.  Australia’s currency bought 99.95 U.S. cents, unchanged
from yesterday, when it traded at $1.0024, the highest level
since exchange controls ended in 1983. It was at 80.77 yen, from
80.57 yen yesterday.  Losses by the dollar were limited after Republicans took
control of the U.S. House and narrowed the Democratic majority
in the Senate in midterm elections, fueling speculation they
will advance policies favorable to businesses. Republicans
gained at least 60 seats in the House yesterday and six in the
Senate.  The U.S. currency may also find support if more than one
policy maker objects to printing new money, according to RBC
Capital Markets.  “More than one dissenter would be supportive of the
dollar,”  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist in Hong Kong,
wrote in a research note today. Investors should also study the
details of the decision, because a suggestion there will be
incremental increases that are “data dependent” may also boost
the U.S. currency, Trinh said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
