The New York Mets exercised their $11
million option for 2011 on shortstop Jose Reyes, who was an All-
Star this past season even while battling health problems.  General Manager Sandy Alderson said in a team news release
that a long-term contract is something the 27-year-old infielder
and the Mets “can certainly discuss at a future date.”   Reyes, who began the 2010 season on the disabled list with
a hyperactive thyroid, hit .282 with 11 home runs, 54 runs
batted in and 30 stolen bases. He was selected for his third
All-Star team and was unable to play because of a strained right
oblique muscle.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
