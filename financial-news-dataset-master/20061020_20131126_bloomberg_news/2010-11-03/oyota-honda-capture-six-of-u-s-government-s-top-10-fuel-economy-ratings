Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Honda Motor
Co.  captured six of the U.S. government’s top 10  fuel-economy
ratings  for 2011 models.  Toyota’s Prius hybrid won the top rating by getting 51
miles per gallon in the city and 48 mpg on the highway, the
Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department said in a
statement today.  Ford Motor Co. , the only U.S. automaker to rate in the top
10, finished second with the Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln
MKZ hybrids. Honda finished in the third position with the Civic
and Insight hybrids and in fourth with the CR-Z hybrid,
according to the two agencies.  Automakers selling models in the U.S. have been trying to
boost the fuel efficiency of their models after President Barack
Obama in April ordered a 5 percent annual increase in mileage to
an average of 35.5 mpg by 2016 models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
