A pending merger of Russia’s
 VimpelCom Ltd.  and Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris’s Weather
Investments SpA may fall through if Weather’s Algeria unit is
excluded from the transaction, according to Renaissance Capital.  “If the Algerian government takes Djezzy away, Telenor
will not be keen on the merger,” Alexander Kazbegi, equity
analyst at Moscow-based investment bank Renaissance Capital,
said by telephone. “Minorities are not happy with the deal to
start with,” he said. Telenor ASA is VimpelCom’s second-biggest
shareholder with a 27 percent stake, according to Bloomberg
data.  Weather controls Djezzy, Algeria’s biggest mobile-network
operator by subscribers, through its Egyptian subsidiary  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE . The Algerian government claims to have
preemption rights to purchase Djezzy before it’s sold to another
buyer. Sawiris on Oct. 4 agreed to merge most of Weather’s phone
assets with VimpelCom, a transaction he said should help end the
long-running ownership dispute.  Considering its $4 billion in debt, Orascom’s valuation
slips into negative equity if Djezzy is excluded from the deal,
Kazbegi said.  Orascom shares have  lost 21 percent since Oct. 5 , the day
after the merger announcement, on lack of clarity over Djezzy.
The shares gained 2.1 percent to 4.31 Egyptian pounds at 1:17
p.m. in Cairo today.  VimpelCom shareholders are scheduled to meet in January to
vote on the merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
