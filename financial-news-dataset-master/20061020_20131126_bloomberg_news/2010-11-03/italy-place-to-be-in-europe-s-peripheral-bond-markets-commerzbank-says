Investors seeking stability among the
so-called peripheral euro government debt markets should be
looking toward Italy given its stronger public finances than
Greece, Ireland or Spain, according to Commerzbank AG.  “If you like to have peripheral exposure, then Italy is the
place to be in the euro area,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank in London.  Peripheral European securities weakened versus their German
counterparts today amid renewed concern about a bank default in
Ireland. The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
securities instead of German debt rose to a record for the third
consecutive day, while yield spreads on both Portuguese and
Greek bonds widened.  The Irish-German spread was at 498 basis points as of 2:14
p.m. in London, according to Bloomberg generic data, more than
triple the 149 basis point equivalent spread for Italy.  “Even at these levels, we recommend investors play from
the safe side and put more weight in Italian bonds,” Schnautz
said by phone. He said Commerzbank doesn’t have explicit
yield-spread targets for peripheral bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
