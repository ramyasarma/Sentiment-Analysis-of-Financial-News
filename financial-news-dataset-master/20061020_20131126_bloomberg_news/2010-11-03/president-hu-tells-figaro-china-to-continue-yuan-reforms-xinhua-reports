Chinese President Hu Jintao said in a
written interview with France’s Le Figaro newspaper and
Portugal’s Lusa News Agency that the nation will continue
exchange rate reforms of the yuan, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported today.  Reforms will be controlled and gradual, Xinhua cited Hu as
saying. China will allow greater flexibility of the yuan and
allow market forces to play a greater role in the currency’s
exchange rate, Hu was cited as saying. Hu conducted the
interview ahead of a visit to France and Portugal from Nov. 4-7.  Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards climbed 0.22
percent to 6.43 per dollar as of 5:30 p.m. in Hong Kong today,
reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 3.7 percent from
the spot rate of 6.6761, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
