General Motors Co.  and its Chinese
partner,  SAIC Motor Corp ., will cooperate on developing
alternative-energy vehicles as the world’s largest auto market
aims to reduce its dependence on oil.  GM, China’s largest overseas carmaker, and Shanghai-based
SAIC may share technologies for developing electric vehicles and
components, the companies said in a e-mailed statement today.
They also will increase the role of their engineering and design
joint venture, the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center in
Shanghai.  The partners join rivals Nissan Motor Co. and  Daimler AG  in
planning to sell cars powered by lithium-ion batteries. China,
the world’s largest oil importer, is offering subsidies to
buyers of such vehicles.  The announcement comes as Detroit-based GM aims to raise as
much as $10.6 billion in an initial public offering, two people
familiar with the plan said Nov. 1. SAIC, which has partnered
with GM in China for more than a decade, has said it may
participate in the offering.  “As a strategic partner of GM, we hope to see a
successful IPO,” Judy Zhu, spokesman for the Chinese automaker,
said today. “However, SAIC still needs more details before
making a decision.”  Shanghai GM, the automakers’ passenger-car venture, sold
about 843,000 vehicles in mainland China during the first 10
months of this year, according to the statement.  -- Liza Lin . Editors:  Michael Tighe ,  Neil Denslow .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
