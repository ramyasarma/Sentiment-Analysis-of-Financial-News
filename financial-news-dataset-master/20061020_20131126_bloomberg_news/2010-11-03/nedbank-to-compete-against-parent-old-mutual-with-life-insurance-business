Nedbank Group Ltd. said it re-entered
South Africa’s life insurance market with 360Life that will
compete against its parent, Old Mutual Plc, which unsuccessfully
tried to sell the lender to HSBC Holdings Plc.  360Life offers cover against death, disability, critical
illness and loss of income, Johannesburg-based Nedbank said in
an e-mailed statement today. It will also compete against Sanlam
Ltd., Liberty Holdings Ltd. and Momentum Group Ltd., it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
