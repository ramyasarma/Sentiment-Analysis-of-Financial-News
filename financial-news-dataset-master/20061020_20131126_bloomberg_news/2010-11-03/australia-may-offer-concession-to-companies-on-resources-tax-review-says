The Australian government may be
willing to give a concession on its proposed minerals
resource rent tax, benefiting mining companies including BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, the Australian Financial
Review said.  The concession involves a more flexible approach on the
issue of how close to the mine gate the tax should cut in, known
as the taxing point, the newspaper said, citing mining sources
without identifying them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
