Republican challenger Todd Young
defeated Democratic incumbent  Baron Hill  to win a U.S. House
seat in Indiana in a crucial race in the battle for control of
the chamber, the Associated Press said.  Young, a 38-year-old  prosecutor , criticized Hill’s votes to
support cap-and-trade legislation and the new health-care law.  With 71 percent of precincts reporting in the competitive
southeast Indiana district, Young had 55 percent of the vote,
and Hill, 57, had 40 percent, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
