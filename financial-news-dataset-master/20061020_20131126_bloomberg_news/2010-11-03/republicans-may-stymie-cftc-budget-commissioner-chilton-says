Republicans in the House could tie up
funding to enforce derivatives reform after gaining a majority
in yesterday’s election, said the  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ’s  Bart Chilton .  “We have enough staff to end up with the final
regulations, we can put them in place, but we don’t have the
ability to do the actual work to have appropriate oversight,”
Chilton said in an interview in Chicago at the Futures Industry
Association conference.  Republicans, who picked up at least 60 House seats across
the U.S. yesterday, say they will use the House Financial
Services Committee to ensure that regulators such as the CFTC
and the new consumer protection bureau don’t write rules that
lawmakers consider too restrictive on the banking industry.  CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  has asked Congress to increase
the agency’s budget by 69 percent next year to $286 million and
predicts the agency’s budgeted staff of about 650 will need to
grow to more than 1,000 to meet its new demands.  In the end Chilton said Congress will fund the commission
to avoid risking another financial crisis.  “I don’t think anybody wants to have blood on their hands
for the next economic calamity, and this law will help that,”
he said.  While technical fixes to the law may be necessary, “I don’t
see any glaring problems in our area,” Chilton said. Changes at
this point are limited as “the law is the law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
