Enbridge Inc ., the largest
transporter of oil to the U.S. from Canada’s tar sands, said
third-quarter profit fell 48 percent.  Net income fell to C$157 million ($156 million), or 42
cents a share, from C$304 million, or 83 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement issued by
Marketwire today.  Enbridge said shipping volumes would’ve been higher except
for a break on its Line 6B in Michigan in July and another on
its 6A line near Chicago in September. The company was forced to
reroute shipments for almost two months in the Michigan
incident.  In April, Enbridge started its 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer)
 Alberta Clipper  line which is capable of carrying 450,000
barrels a day to Wisconsin from the western Canadian province.
The company has also completed expansions of its gathering
systems in Alberta and North Dakota.  The company released its results today before regular
trading opened on North American exchanges. Enbridge  fell  21
cents to C$56.04 yesterday in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.
The shares, which have eight buy and nine hold  ratings  from
analysts, have gained 15 percent this year.  (Enbridge will hold a conference call to discuss its
second-quarter results at 9 a.m. New York time. To listen, click
