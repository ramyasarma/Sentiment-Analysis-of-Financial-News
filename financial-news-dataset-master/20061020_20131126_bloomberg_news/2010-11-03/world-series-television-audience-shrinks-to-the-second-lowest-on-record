The San Francisco Giants’ five-game
World Series victory over the Texas Rangers attracted an average
of 14.3 million TV viewers a night to Fox, the second lowest on
record after the 2008 matchup, according to Nielsen Co. data.  The contest two years ago between the Philadelphia Phillies
and Tampa Bay Rays drew an average of 13.6 million viewers,
Nielsen data show. The two series tied for the all-time lowest
Nielsen rating at 8.4 percent of U.S. TV households.  This year’s series audience was 26 percent lower than last
season’s Major League Baseball championship between New York and
Philadelphia, when an average of 19.4 million viewers watched
the Yankees beat the Phillies in the six-game matchup,  News
Corp. ’s Fox Sports said last year.  The larger viewer total this year reflects a higher
population and more TV viewers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
