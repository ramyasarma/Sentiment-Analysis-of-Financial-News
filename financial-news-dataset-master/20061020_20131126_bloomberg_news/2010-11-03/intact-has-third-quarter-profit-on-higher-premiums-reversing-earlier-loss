Intact Financial Corp . reported a
third-quarter profit of C$82.3 million ($81.7 million),
rebounding from a year-earlier loss. The shares had their
biggest gain in more than two months after earnings topped
analysts’ estimates.  The profit was 72 cents a share, Toronto-based Intact said
today in a statement. A year ago, the insurer had a loss of C$8
million, or 7 cents a share when it had higher claims for storm
damage in Alberta and central Canada.  Intact, Canada’s largest property and casualty insurer,
said direct premiums increased 5.4 percent to C$1.21 billion in
the quarter.  Before one-time items, Intact earned 78 cents a share. That
exceeded the 57 cent-a-share average  estimate  of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Intact climbed C$1.72, or 3.8 percent, to C$47.37 in 4 p.m.
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have risen 28
percent this year, compared with a 3.7 percent gain for the 44
member  S&P/TSX Financials Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
