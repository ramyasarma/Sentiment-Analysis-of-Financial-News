Brazil’s trade  surplus  jumped 70
percent in October from September as exports rose faster than
imports for the first time since January.  The  trade surplus  rose to $1.85 billion in October from
$1.09 billion in September, the Trade Ministry  said . The monthly
surplus was lower than the $2 billion median forecast from 17
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Exports  rose 30.5 percent from a year ago to $18.4 billion
in October, while  imports  rose 29.5 percent to $16.5 billion,
the ministry said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected
exports of $18.5 billion and imports of $16.5 billion, according
to the median forecast from 11 analysts.  Brazil tripled last month to 6 percent a tax on foreign
purchases of fixed-income securities in a bid to stem gains in
the real. The currency weakened 0.55 percent versus the dollar
in October after gaining 3.4 percent this year through
September. A strong real coupled with  economic growth  that is
forecast to reach the fastest pace in more than two decades are
boosting imports to Latin America’s biggest economy.  Brazil’s economy may grow 7.3 percent this year, fueled by
 domestic demand , credit  expansion  and  investments , the central
bank said on its quarterly inflation report Sept. 30. Economists
surveyed by the central bank expect GDP growth of 7.6 percent
this year, according to a weekly survey released this week.  Rising Real  Brazil’s real rose 0.4 percent to 1.6970 per U.S. dollar at
10:51 a.m. New York time, from 1.7030 on Nov. 1. In the
overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on the
contract due in January 2012 increased three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.35 percent.  Brazilian Trade Secretary  Welber Barral  last week raised
the government’s 2010 export target by 27 percent to $195
billion on higher sales to Latin American countries. Industrial
goods account for 79 percent of Brazilian goods exported to
Latin America and the Caribbean, data compiled by the Trade
Ministry show.  Developing economies are expected to expand an average 7.1
percent this year before slowing to 6.4 percent in 2011, while
advanced economies will grow an average 2.7 percent and 2.2
percent in those years, the International Monetary Fund said in
its World Economic Outlook released on Oct. 6.  After raising Brazil’s  benchmark interest rate  by two
percentage points this year to 10.75 percent from a record low
8.75 percent to prevent “overheating,” policy makers kept
borrowing costs unchanged for the second straight meeting Oct.
19-20.  Food Prices  The central bank still expects  inflation  to converge to the
government’s 4.5 percent midpoint  target  even as more costly
food pressures consumer prices indexes, policy makers said last
week in the minutes of their October meeting. They also said the
outlook for inflation depends on a more moderate expansion of
credit and government  spending  next year.  Brazil’s economic expansion leveled off in August, easing
bets that the central bank will be forced to resume rate
increases early next year to rein in consumer prices. Brazil’s
seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a proxy for gross
domestic product, was little changed at 139.12 points in August,
compared with a revised 139.13 points in July, the central bank
said Oct. 20  Brazil’s 12-month  current account  gap widened to a record
high in September as domestic demand boosted imports and the
real’s rally boosted profit remittances and spending on trips
abroad, the central bank said last week. The deficit widened to
$47.3 billion, or 2.4 percent of GDP, from 2.32 percent in
August, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
