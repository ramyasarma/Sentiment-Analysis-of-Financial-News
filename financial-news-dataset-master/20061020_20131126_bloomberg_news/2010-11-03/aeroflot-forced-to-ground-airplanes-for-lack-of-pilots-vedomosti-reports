OAO Aeroflot, Russia’s largest
airline, is grounding airplanes because of a lack of pilots,
Vedomosti reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Vitaly
Savelyev.  The state-run carrier has already grounded eight airplanes
and may have to take another four of five out of service by the
end of the year, the Moscow-based newspaper reported today.  Aeroflot has to remove pilots from rotation once they’ve
flown 800 hours within a 12 month period, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
