Republican  Robert Hurt  won election
to the U.S. House from Virginia, the Associated Press said,
defeating Democratic incumbent  Tom Perriello  in one of the races
that will help determine control of the chamber.  Hurt, 41, a state senator, capitalized on voter disapproval
of Perriello’s support of the Obama administration’s economic
stimulus measure and the new health-care law. Perriello, 36, was
first elected in 2008 in a wave of support for President  Barack Obama . Obama campaigned for Perriello on Oct. 29.  The district consists of much of southern Virginia, west of
Richmond and spreading across the Blue Ridge Mountains. It
includes Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia,
and skirts around Lynchburg.  Hurt had 52 percent of the vote with 85 percent of the
precincts reporting, while Perriello had 42 percent, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
