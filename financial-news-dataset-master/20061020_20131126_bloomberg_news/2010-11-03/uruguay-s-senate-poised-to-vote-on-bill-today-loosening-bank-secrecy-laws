Uruguay’s Senate is debating
legislation today to change the country’s bank secrecy laws in
cases of suspected evasion or money laundering and to tax
Uruguayan investments abroad.  The bill, introduced in May by President  Jose Mujica ’s
Frente Amplio party, would give the tax agency director
authority to lift bank secrecy protections in certain criminal
cases or when requested by a foreign government that has an
established treaty with Uruguay. It would also place a
12 percent tax on deposits, stock and bond payments and other
investments held by Uruguayans abroad.  Uruguayan banks had $18 billion in deposits in September,
about 17 percent of which is held by foreigners, according to an
Oct. 15 report by the central bank.  In 2009 Uruguay appeared on a list of so-called tax havens
compiled by the Organization of Economic Cooperation &
Development as a country that wasn’t “committed to the
internationally agreed tax standards.” Then-Finance Minister
Alvaro Garcia sent a letter to OECD Secretary General  Angel Gurria  pledging to adopt OECD standards on transparency and the
exchange of tax information.  On Aug. 18 the OECD included Uruguay on a so-called grey
list of countries that “have committed to implement the
internationally agreed tax standards, but have not yet
substantially implemented” them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
