Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
said South Africa’s mid-term budget, released last week by
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan , had a “lot of positive news,”
Business Day reported, citing  Konrad Reuss , the rating company’s
managing director for Sub-Saharan Africa.  S&P will consider this when reviewing the negative outlook
it has on South Africa’s credit rating, the Johannesburg-based
 newspaper  cited Reuss as saying.  South Africa is rated BBB+ by S&P, the third-lowest
investment-grade rating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
