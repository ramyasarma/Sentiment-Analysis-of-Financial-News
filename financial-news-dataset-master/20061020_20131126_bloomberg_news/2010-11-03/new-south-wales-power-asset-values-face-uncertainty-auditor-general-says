New South Wales power station asset
valuations may be affected by “significant uncertainty”
because of the unknown impact of any future Australian carbon
pollution reduction system and government industry reforms, the
state’s auditor-general, Peter Achterstraat, said in a statement
today.  New South Wales expects to complete the sale of electricity
assets in early 2011, Achterstraat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
