The dollar traded near a nine-month
low against the euro after the Federal Reserve said it will
purchase more government debt, debasing the greenback.  The U.S. currency fell versus 15 of 16 major counterparts
as the Fed said it will buy an additional $600 billion of
Treasuries through June. The New Zealand dollar surged to its
highest level since 2008 after a government report showed
employers added more jobs than economists estimated, boosting
expectations the central bank will raise interest rates.  “The plan overall was a slightly larger program than
expected but at slightly slower pace at the margin,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “The
fact is that the Fed prints money, and monetizing debt does
debase the currency.”  The dollar traded at $1.4125 per euro at 8:55 a.m. in Tokyo
from $1.4139 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.4179, the
lowest since Jan. 26. The yen was at 81.08 per dollar from 81.07
yesterday, when it reached 81.58, the least since Oct. 28. The
euro bought 114.51 yen from 114.64 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.8 percent to 78.61 U.S. cents.
It reached 78.86 cents, the most since June 2008. The kiwi
advanced 0.8 percent to 63.73 yen.  Stocks in Japan, Australia and South Korea extended a
global rally as the Fed’s Open Market Committee said in a
statement in Washington that the central bank “will adjust the
program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price
stability.”  Fed Easing  Fed policy makers maintained their pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period.” Economists’ forecasts for
the size of the Fed’s purchase program, known as quantitative
easing, ranged from $500 billion to $2 trillion. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific  Index of regional shares rose 0.8 percent after the
 Standard & Poor’s 500  Index advanced 0.4 percent yesterday.  New Zealand’s currency gained for a sixth day against the
yen and dollar after Statistics New Zealand said the  jobless
rate  dropped to a seasonally adjusted 6.4 percent in the third
quarter, compared with the median estimate of 6.7 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “The jobs number was strong across all measures and the
market will probably start pricing in a hike in March,” said
 Imre Speizer , a market strategist in Wellington with Westpac
Banking Corp. “The kiwi dollar will likely target 80 cents in
the next week or two and the Aussie should hold above parity now
with the dollar under pressure after the Fed’s announcement.”  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
