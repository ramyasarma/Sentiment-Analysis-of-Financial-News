What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange as dry weather threatens early
development of winter crops in the southern U.S. Great Plains,
said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT on speculation that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
will reduce its estimate of this year’s domestic crop after hot,
dry weather and flooding reduced yields, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that the dollar will decline, boosting the appeal
of U.S. exports, Grow said. Soybean-meal futures may open steady
to 50 cents higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected
to open up 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
