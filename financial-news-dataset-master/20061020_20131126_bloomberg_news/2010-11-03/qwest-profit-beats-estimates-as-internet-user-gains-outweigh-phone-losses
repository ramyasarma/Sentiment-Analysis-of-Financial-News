Qwest Communications International
Inc. , the phone company being acquired by CenturyLink Inc.,
posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates after
adding more subscribers to its Internet service.  Profit , excluding some charges, was 11 cents a share,
compared with 9 cents a year ago, the Denver-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts had anticipated 9 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Qwest is preparing to be wrapped into CenturyLink, which
agreed to buy the company in April for more than $10 billion in
stock to create one of the largest U.S. home-phone companies.
CenturyLink Chief Executive Officer  Glen Post  has said he will
shift the businesses’ focus to high-speed Internet service from
the shrinking home-phone operations.  Sales  fell 3.9 percent to $2.94 billion. Analysts predicted
$2.9 billion. The company had a net loss of $90 million, or 5
cents a share, compared with a profit of $136 million, or 8
cents, a year earlier.  Qwest rose 6 cents to $6.67 in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading  yesterday. CenturyLink, which will report
third-quarter earnings later today, added 39 cents to $41.83.  (Qwest will hold a conference call at 9 a.m. to discuss
results. Go to  http://investor.qwest.com/presentations  to access
the call.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
