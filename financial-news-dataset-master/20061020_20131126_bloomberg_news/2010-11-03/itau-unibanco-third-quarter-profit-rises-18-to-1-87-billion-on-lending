Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s
biggest bank by market value, said third-quarter profit climbed
18 percent as lending in Latin America’s largest economy rose to
record levels.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
increased to 3.2 billion reais ($1.87 billion), or 70 centavos a
share, from 2.7 billion reais, or 60 centavos, a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. The
mean estimate for adjusted net income was 3.31 billion reais in
a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Outstanding loans in Brazil increased 19.7 percent in
September from a year earlier to a record 1.61 trillion reais,
led by a 51.4 percent expansion in mortgage lending, the
country’s central bank said Oct. 26.  Itau Unibanco concluded in October, one month ahead of
schedule, the integration of all Itau and Unibanco branches,
which had a “negative effect” on third-quarter results, said
 Eduardo Nishio , a Banco BTG Pactual analyst, in a note to
clients Oct. 29. “For the future, we should be able to see more
normalized expenses, enabling the bank to expand return on
equity,” he wrote.  Itau Unibanco’s loan portfolio rose 17 percent from a year
earlier to 313.19 billion reais, while total assets increased 12
percent to 686.25 billion reais, the bank said. The average
default rate, defined as a delay in payment of more than 90
days, fell to 4.3 percent at the end of September from 4.6
percent in the second quarter and 5.9 percent a year earlier.  Net income without adjustments in the quarter increased 33
percent to 3.03 billion reais.  Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market
value, said on Oct. 27 its adjusted net income increased 40
percent to 2.52 billion reais.  Itau rose 0.6 percent to 42.52 reais in Sao Paulo trading
at 10:58 a.m. New York time while the  Bovespa  benchmark index
gained 0.4 percent. The bank’s shares have advanced 9.9 percent
this year, compared with a gain of 23 percent for Bradesco and
4.8 percent for the Bovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Helder Marinho  in Sao
