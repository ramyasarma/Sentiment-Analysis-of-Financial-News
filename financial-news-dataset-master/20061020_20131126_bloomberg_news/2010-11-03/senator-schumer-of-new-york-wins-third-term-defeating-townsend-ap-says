U.S. Senator  Charles Schumer  of New
York defeated Republican businessman  Jay Townsend  to win a third
term, the Associated Press projected.  Schumer , 59, is chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and
a former chairman of the Senate Democrats’ fundraising arm. He
is a possible Senate Democratic leader in the next Congress if
the lawmaker who currently holds that position,  Harry Reid  of
Nevada, loses his re-election bid.  Schumer raised more than $19 million for his  re-election 
and gave $2 million in September to the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee. He won his Senate seat in 1998 by ousting
incumbent Republican  Alfonse D’Amato  and retained it in 2004.  Townsend , 56, had defeated  Gary Berntsen , a former Central
Intelligence Agency officer, in the September primary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
