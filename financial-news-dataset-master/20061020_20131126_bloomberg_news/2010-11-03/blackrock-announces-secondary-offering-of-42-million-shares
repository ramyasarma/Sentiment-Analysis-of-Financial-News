BlackRock Inc.  said Bank of  America
Corp.  and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., two of its biggest
 shareholders , plan to sell 42 million shares of the world’s
largest asset-management firm.  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, will
offer 34.5 million common shares through a secondary sale,
BlackRock said today in a statement. Pittsburgh-based PNC will
sell as many as 7.5 million common shares. BlackRock will not
receive any proceeds from the sales.  Banks hurt by the financial crisis that started in 2008
have been unloading investments that they don’t consider crucial
to their main businesses. Bank of America, BlackRock’s biggest
investor, in July was considering reducing its 34 percent stake,
a person briefed on the matter said in August.  Bobbie Collins , a spokeswoman for New York-based BlackRock,
declined to comment.  Bank of America owned 2.3 million, or 3.7 percent, of
BlackRock common stock as of Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It also held 63.5 million shares of
series B convertible preferred shares. Bank of America got its
stake in BlackRock through its  acquisition  of Merrill Lynch &
Co. last year.  PNC owned 22.1 million shares, or 35 percent, of BlackRock
common as of June 30, the Bloomberg data show. It also held 24.3
million of preferred shares. PNC was BlackRock’s owner before
the fund manager went public in 1999.  Barclays Plc in London got a 20 percent stake in BlackRock
as part of its deal to sell its investment unit to the firm in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
