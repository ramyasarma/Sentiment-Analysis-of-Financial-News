Corn and soybean futures rose for the
first time in three sessions as the Federal Reserve discusses
stimulus plans and a rally in oil prices boosted prospects for
crop-based fuels.  The Fed probably will resume purchases of bonds to spur
economic growth, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The measures may boost help demand for commodities from
investors and consumers. Crude oil rose for a third straight
day, touching the highest price in almost six months.  “The general attitude is that anything the Fed does today
will ultimately be inflationary, and that will be bullish for
grain prices,” said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “Rising crude-oil
prices provides underlying support.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 4.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $5.805 a bushel at 12:05 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after falling 1.1 percent the past two sessions. On
Oct. 1, the price reached $5.9075, the highest level since
August 2008. Prices surged 17 percent in October after hot, dry
weather reduced the size of the U.S. crop.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $12.37 a bushel in Chicago, erasing an earlier 1
percent decline. On Oct. 28, the price reached $12.4875, the
highest level for a most-active contract since September 2008.
The commodity jumped 12 percent in October on rising sales to
China, the biggest consumer of the oilseed.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter of both
crops. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans at $31.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
