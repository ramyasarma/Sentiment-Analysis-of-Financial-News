National Bank of Kenya Ltd. , a state-
owned lender, said nine-month profit jumped 39 percent as
earnings from loans grew.  Net income climbed to 1.35 billion shillings ($16.8
million) in the period through September, from 973 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based lender said in a
statement distributed by the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  today. Net
interest income, the money banks earn from issuing loans, grew
28 percent to 3.18 billion shillings, it said.  The company’s stock has risen 43 percent so far this year,
underperforming a 44 percent advance in the benchmark  NSE-20
Index  over the same period. The shares were untraded today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
