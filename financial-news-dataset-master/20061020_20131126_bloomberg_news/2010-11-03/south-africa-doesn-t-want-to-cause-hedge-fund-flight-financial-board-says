South Africa doesn’t want to deter
hedge funds from operating in the country by introducing overly
restrictive industry rules, the  Financial Services Board  said.  “I don’t think our intention is to cause a flight of hedge
funds out of the country because the regulation is too tight,”
Patrick Ward, the head of the regulator’s collective investment
schemes unit, told the Hedge Funds World Africa conference in
Cape Town today. “It’s a balance we are seeking to achieve.”  South Africa’s regulator expects draft legislation for
hedge funds to be adopted by the first half of 2012, and still
has to decide whether they will be governed by the same rules as
mutual funds. While hedge fund managers are currently regulated
in South Africa, the funds they oversee are not.  The U.S. and European Union have stepped up regulation of
the hedge fund industry blamed by lawmakers for exacerbating the
financial crisis. Hedge funds are mostly private pools of
capital whose managers participate substantially in the profits
from their speculation on whether the price of assets will rise
or fall.  Hedge funds offered to private individuals or funds where
pensioners’ savings are invested should be subject to tighter
regulation, Ward said.  “We wouldn’t want that investors who participate would be
exposed to any greater extent than the investment they put into
the fund,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
