(Corrects attribution for report in last paragraph.)  Japanese stock futures rose after the
Federal Reserve said it will expand record measures to boost the
U.S. economy, the world’s largest. BHP Billiton Ltd. led
Australian stocks higher after a proposed takeover was rejected.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp., a Japanese
electronics maker that derives more than 20 percent of its sales
in the U.S., climbed 1.5 percent from the last closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of Canon Inc., the world’s largest camera
maker, increased 1.4 percent. BHP, the world’s biggest mining
company, jumped 2.8 percent after Canadian regulators blocked
its planned acquisition of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Since the Fed’s measures “were close to what people had
expected, a sense of ease spread,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Since the scale of easing was
moderate, there are still hopes for further easing.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,280 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,175 in Singapore on Nov. 2. Japan’s markets were closed
yesterday for a national holiday. Futures were bid in the pre-
market at 9,280 in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.6 percent today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index gained 0.4 percent to a six-month high
of 1,197.96 yesterday in New York as banks rose after the Fed
said it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries
through June.  Valuations, Yen  The Bank of Japan said last week that policy makers
advanced their next session to today and tomorrow, following the
Fed’s meeting of Nov. 2-3.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 8.7 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 7.4 percent by the S&P 500
and 5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.3 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 81.58 today against the dollar, the
weakest level this month. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The Japanese currency appreciated to 80.22 on Nov. 1, the
highest level since 1995. The yen is on course for its strongest
annual average level since currencies began trading freely in
1971, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each
day’s closing price.  Commodities Advance  Crude oil for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent
yesterday in New York to $84.69 a barrel, the highest settlement
price since May 3. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for
six industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1
percent yesterday, its first decline this week.  About 140 companies of almost 1,000 in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index are scheduled to announce earnings this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far, about 17
companies have exceeded profit estimates for every 14 that have
fallen short, based on Bloomberg data compiled from about 410
companies that have reported quarterly results since Oct. 7.  American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank by market value, jumped 1.3
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after Nikkei
English News said the company may buy project-finance assets
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  To contact the reporter for this story:
