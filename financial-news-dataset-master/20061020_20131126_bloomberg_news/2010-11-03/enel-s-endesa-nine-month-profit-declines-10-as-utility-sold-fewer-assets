Endesa SA , Spain’s second-largest

lower asset sales.  Net income  fell to 2.7 billion euros ($3.8 billion) from
3.05 billion euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization were little changed at 5.8 billion
euros, according to the filing.  The company raised 159 million euros less in disposals in
the nine months through September compared to the year ago
period, the company said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
