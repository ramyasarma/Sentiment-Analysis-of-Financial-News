Solyndra Inc., a U.S. solar-panel
maker that won a $535 million federal loan guarantee to built a
new robotic factory, will say today that it will close an older
plant and lay off staff, the New York Times said, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Brian Harrison.   The step shows how U.S. solar-energy companies are having
trouble competing with Chinese companies that use more
conventional technology, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
