Chile’s peso fell as the U.S. dollar
strengthened against major currencies amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will restart purchases of bonds to spur the U.S.
economy and copper, Chile’s main export, declined.  The peso lost 0.3 percent to 488.45 per dollar as of 11:12
a.m. New York time from 486.95 yesterday.  The Fed may pledge to buy $500 billion or more in
securities under a policy called quantitative easing, according
to 29 of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Federal
Open Markets Committee is scheduled to publish its decision at
3:15 p.m. New York time today. Copper fell 0.5 percent to
$3.8205 a pound after the World Bank said China should raises
interest rates to damp inflation.  “The market’s very quiet today,” said  Osvaldo Cruz , an
economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in Santiago. “We’re
waiting for the announcement of quantitative easing that should
come out today. The peso should trade between 485 and 490 per
dollar until the Fed, and then we’ll see.”  The Chilean electronic stock exchange reported $476 million
of Chilean peso trading as of 10:47 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
