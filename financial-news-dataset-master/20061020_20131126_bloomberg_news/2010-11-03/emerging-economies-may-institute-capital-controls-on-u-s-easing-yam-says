Emerging economies may use
currency gains and temporary capital controls to cope with
money inflows sparked by U.S. monetary easing, said  Joseph Yam , former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  “I certainly hope that emerging market economies will
be able to cope,” Yam said in a speech at a forum in Beijing
today. Measures could include “currency appreciation,
exchange market intervention, temporary capital controls,
macro prudential measures to contain bubbles and supervisory
measures to limit their damage on the financial system and
the economy should the bubbles burst,” he said.  Yam also said in a panel discussion that Hong Kong
should maintain a currency peg to the dollar and can’t use
the yuan for that purpose because it isn’t fully convertible.  -- Zheng Lifei . Editors:  Paul Panckhurst ,  Chris Anstey .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
