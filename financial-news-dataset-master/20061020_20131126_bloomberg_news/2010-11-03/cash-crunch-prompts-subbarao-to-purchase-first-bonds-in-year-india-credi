India’s central bank is intervening
to buy government bonds for the first time in more than a year
to alleviate the nation’s worst  cash crunch  on record.  The Reserve Bank of India will hold its first open-market
auction since September 2009 today, seeking to pump 120 billion
rupees ($2.7 billion) into banks after overnight money-market
rates surged to a two-year high of  12.25 percent . The RBI will
achieve 50 percent of its target, according to the median
estimate of 10 finance companies surveyed by Bloomberg.  Indian bonds are set for the biggest weekly gain since May
after central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in an
interview yesterday that six interest-rate increases this year
have slowed  inflation , and he favors policies “supportive of
growth” once prices are controlled. The rate of money-supply
expansion in India declined to a five-year low of 15 percent in
the two weeks through mid-October. The growth compared with
September rates of 19.8 percent in Brazil, 19 percent in China
and 31.2 percent in Russia.  “The RBI is using every option to ensure that under no
circumstances, economic growth is derailed,”  Krishnamurthy Harihar , the Mumbai-based treasurer at the Indian unit of
FirstRand Ltd., South Africa’s second-largest financial services
company, said in a Nov. 2 interview. “The central bank is
seeking to keep sufficient liquidity in the system to support
investment.”  Lenders are relying more on overnight loans from the
central bank to meet cash shortages after investors pulled money
from deposits to subscribe to Coal India Ltd.’s 152 billion
rupee initial share sale last month. The  borrowing  touched an
all-time high of 1.2 trillion rupees on Oct. 29 and has averaged
532 billion rupees a day since Oct. 1, more than twice the
amount in September, RBI data show.  Corporate Rates  The yield on three-month  commercial paper  sold by Indian
companies almost doubled this year to 8.28 percent as Subbarao
lifted the  repurchase rate  by 150 basis points, or 1.5
percentage points, to 6.25 percent to curb inflation that has
averaged 9.7 percent this year. The rate jumped 88 basis points
in October, the most in five months.  Rising short-term borrowing rates may cause corporate
profits as a share of sales to shrink,  Raman Uberoi , the senior
director in Mumbai at Crisil Ltd., the Indian unit of Standard &
Poor’s, said in an Oct. 27 interview. The  International Monetary
Fund  raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for India on Oct.
6 to 9.7 percent from 9.4 percent, the fastest pace after China.  ‘Primary Concern’  “Inflation is the primary concern of the central bank,”
Subbarao said in an interview with Bloomberg-UTV yesterday. “If
inflation is under control, I would like to run the monetary
policy supportive of growth.”  Yields on the benchmark 7.8 percent government note due in
2020 fell 2 basis points to 7.95 percent yesterday, taking the
decline this week to 16 basis points, the most since the
security was issued in May.  “Investor sentiment is more positive because the cash-
crunch situation is set to change,” said  Debendra Kumar Dash , a
fixed-income trader in Mumbai at Development Credit Bank Ltd.
“I am expecting bonds to sustain gains in the short-term.”  The rupee gained 0.1 percent to 44.35 per dollar yesterday,
bringing its appreciation this year to 4.9 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. India’s government bonds returned
4.3 percent this year, the third-worst performance among 10
local-currency debt markets outside Japan, according to indexes
compiled by London- based HSBC Holdings Plc.  Rural Electrification Corp., India’s state-controlled
lender to power projects, will sell 33 billion rupees ($744
million) of 10-year zero-coupon bonds on Nov. 10, Finance
Director  Hari Das Khunteta  said in an interview yesterday.  Halting Surge  The last time Subbarao bought bonds from banks, he
succeeded in  halting  a four-month surge in government debt
yields that threatened to disrupt Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee ’s record borrowing plan for the year ended March 31.
The central bank  picked  up 20 billion rupees of debt on Sept.
24, 2009, after targeting 60 billion rupees of purchases.  “Even though a liquidity deficit is consistent with an
anti-inflation stance, an excessive deficit can be disruptive to
both financial markets and credit growth,” the central bank
said in a Nov. 2 statement after raising interest rates. Policy
makers are also holding additional daily money-market auctions
this week and allowed lenders to temporarily lower holdings of
debt below regulatory requirements.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June, expanding record stimulus
and risking its credibility in a bid to reduce unemployment and
avert deflation, according to a statement yesterday from the
Fed’s Open Market Committee.  ‘More Successful’  The RBI is planning to purchase fixed-income notes maturing
in 2015, 2016 and 2020 at today’s auction. The move follows a
government repurchase offer last week that achieved less than 25
percent of the targeted amount. The Finance Ministry bought 25
billion rupees of fixed-income securities at an Oct. 25 auction
after offering to pick up 2010 and 2011 notes worth as much as
120 billion rupees.  “The central bank may be more successful,”  Mahendra Jajoo , head of fixed-income investments in Mumbai at Pramerica
Asset Managers Pvt., the Indian unit of U.S.-based Prudential
Financial Inc., said in an interview yesterday. “The longer-
term securities it has offered to buy are the ones that
investors are looking to offload.”  The government sold 40 billion rupees of 91-day bills
yesterday at 6.7706 percent and 20 billion rupees of 364-day
debt at 7.0743 percent. Three-month  Treasury bill  yields have
risen 308 basis points this year to 6.65 percent, compared with
a 198 basis-point gain to 10.65 percent in Brazil and 69 basis
points to 2.01 percent in China.  “The RBI measures will reduce the cash crunch by a large
extent by the end of December,”  Indranil Pan , chief economist
at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, said in an interview
yesterday. “A series of open-market auctions will go a long way
in improving the situation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
