India’s 12-year  bonds  gained for a
sixth day, pushing the yield to the lowest level in more than a
month, before a planned central bank purchase of securities
tomorrow.  The yield on the most-traded debt due 2022 fell to the
lowest level since Sept. 29 as the planned 120 billion rupee
($2.7 billion) purchase of securities by the  Reserve Bank of
India  will boost cash in the banking system. Banks, the biggest
buyers of government debt, have been relying on the central bank
for  daily funds  through securities repurchase agreements since
Sept. 9.  “Investor sentiment is more positive because the cash-
crunch situation is set to change,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a
fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “I am
expecting bonds to sustain gains in the short-term.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due May 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8 percent as of 9:30
a.m. in Mumbai, dropping for a sixth straight day, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The price rose 0.05, or 5
paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.95.  The Reserve Bank will purchase 7.38 percent notes due 2015,
7.02 percent debt maturing in 2016 and 7.80 percent, 10-year
securities at the open-market auction, it said.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
dropped a second day. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, fell to 6.60 percent from 6.61 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
