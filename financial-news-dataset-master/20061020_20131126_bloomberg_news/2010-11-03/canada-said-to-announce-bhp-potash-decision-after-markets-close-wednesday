Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  plans to announce his decision on whether the government
approves  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s  $40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. tomorrow after markets close in New York, said
an official familiar with the announcement.  Under the Investment Canada Act, the deadline for a
decision is tomorrow unless Melbourne-based BHP agrees to an
extension. The transaction is opposed by Saskatchewan Premier
 Brad Wall  and federal opposition parties, who have said the
hostile takeover is bad for Saskatchewan, which accounts for
about 30 percent of global potash production.  The government official asked not to be identified because
they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
