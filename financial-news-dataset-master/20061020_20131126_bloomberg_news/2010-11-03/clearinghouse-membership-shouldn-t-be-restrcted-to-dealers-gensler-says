Clearinghouse membership shouldn’t be
restricted to derivatives dealers and should be open to non-
dealer financial institutions and asset managers, the top U.S.
derivatives regulator said today.  The  Dodd-Frank financial overhaul , which became law in
July, gave the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a year to
establish rules governing the $615 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market, including which companies will be
categorized as swap dealers or major swap participants. Those
are designations that entail higher capital requirements and
increased scrutiny.  “What we’ve learned from the futures marketplace is that
clearinghouses work well when they are broadly inclusive of many
members,” CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  said today in remarks
prepared for a speech at a Futures Industry Association
conference in Chicago.  The law, named for its primary authors, Senate Banking
Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat, and
House Financial Services Chairman  Barney Frank , a Massachusetts
Democrat, aims to stem systemic risk by requiring most interest-
rate, credit-default and other swaps be processed by
clearinghouses after being traded on exchanges or swap-execution
facilities.  Congress took aim at the industry after soured trades on
mortgage and credit derivatives tipped the U.S. economy into the
deepest recession since the 1930s.  “Membership criteria should be transparent, objective and
nondiscriminatory,” to parties that meet risk management,
operational and financial requirements, Gensler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
