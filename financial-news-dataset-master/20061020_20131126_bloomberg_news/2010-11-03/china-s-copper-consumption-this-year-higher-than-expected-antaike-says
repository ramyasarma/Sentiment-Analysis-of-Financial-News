Copper  consumption in China, the
largest user, will be higher than expected this year because of
strong demand from makers of autos, air-conditioners and
electronics, Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. said.  Refined copper consumption is estimated to grow by 11.5
percent to 6.8 million metric tons this year, more than
Antaike’s forecast for an expansion of 10.7 percent in the
middle of this year and 8 percent at the beginning of 2010,  Yang Changhua , a senior analyst, said today in a speech at the China
International Copper Conference in Ningbo.  “The investment stimulus package is still playing a role
this year, supporting demand growth,” Yang said, referring to
last year’s 4 trillion-yuan ($599 billion) government spending
program to pump up growth during the financial crisis.
“Investment in the power sector has declined,” he said.  Output of the refined metal in the world’s largest producer
will probably grow 10 percent to 4.55 million tons this year,
resulting in a deficit of 2.25 million tons, according to
Antaike.  The deficit may widen to 2.44 million tons in 2011, based
on an assumed 8 percent increase in consumption and a 7.7
percent rise in output, Yang said.  “Consumption growth may slow down a bit next year as there
are quite a few negative factors,” Yang said. A further
shrinking of investment in the power sector, an appreciating
currency that may pressure Chinese exports and high copper
prices will all damp demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
