Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
biggest producer of the robusta variety of the beans, fell 5.5
percent in October because of a smaller crop, the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority said.  Shipments declined to 188,012 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags,
from 199,011 bags a year earlier, the authority said today by e-
mail from the capital, Kampala. Exports in October, the first
month of the 2010-11 season, were higher than forecast because
of “high closing stocks” from the previous season, the agency
said.  Shipments in 2010-11 may increase 16 percent to 3.1 million
bags because of expected favorable weather,  David Kiwanuka , the
authority’s spokesman, said in September. Ugandan coffee is
mostly rain-fed because the bulk of the crop is grown by small-
scale farmers who can’t afford irrigation.  Exports of coffee from the East African nation, which
consumes only 3 percent of its crop, fell to 2.67 million bags
last year from 3.06 million bags in 2008-09 after a drought
reduced yields.  Output in Uganda slumped from more than 4 million bags in
1996-97 after coffee wilt disease destroyed part of the crop,
according to the authority. New plantings and improving farm
management may help the country boost output to 4.5 million bags
by 2015, the authority says.  Uganda is Africa’s second-biggest exporter of coffee, after
 Ethiopia , according to the  International Coffee Organization ’s
website. Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of the country’s
annual output and the country earned $243.6 million from the
crop last season, compared with $291.3 million in 2008-09, the
authority said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
