Republicans were projected to take
control of the U.S. House and picked up at least two Senate
seats in U.S. midterm elections shaped by voter anxiety over
jobs and the economy.  Republicans gained House seats in Virginia, Florida and
Indiana, and took Senate seats from Democrats in Indiana and
Arkansas, according to projections. CNN, CBS and MSNBC predicted
Republicans won enough races to capture a House majority,
delivering a rebuke to President  Barack Obama . The party needed
a net gain of at least 39 seats to control the chamber next
year.  Republicans faced an uphill battle in their quest for
Senate control.  The midterm campaign has been focused on a national
unemployment rate at or above 9.5 percent for the last 14
months, criticism of the White House’s domestic agenda and an
anti-Washington sentiment reflected in the Tea Party movement.  Editors:  Don Frederick , Mark McQuillan.   To contact the reporters on this story:  Lisa Lerer  in
