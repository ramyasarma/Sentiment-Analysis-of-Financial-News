PulteGroup Inc. , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, reported a wider third-quarter loss as
the company recorded almost $1 billion in charges amid slumping
home sales. The shares dropped the most in almost 18 months.  The net loss widened to $995.1 million, or $2.63 a share,
from $361.4 million, or $1.15, a year earlier, the Bloomfield
Hills, Michigan-based company said today in a statement. The
loss included $986 million in charges for goodwill impairment,
insurance reserves, and land-related costs, the company said.
Analysts projected a loss of 5 cents a share, the average of 17
estimates in a Bloomberg  survey .  “Reporting these numbers is disappointing, especially
given the tremendous strides our operations have made over the
past 12 months,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Dugas  said
today during a conference call with analysts.  PulteGroup said it had impairment costs totaling $655
million on its August 2009  purchase  of Centex Corp. after a
plunge in U.S. home sales and in anticipation that the industry
will be “challenged” in the year ahead. Housing demand fell
after the expiration of a tax incentive and has remained weak as
the U.S. jobless rate lingers close to 10 percent. New homes
sold at an annual rate of 307,000 in September, close to the
record low reached in May, according to the Commerce Department.  PulteGroup’s third-quarter revenue fell to $1.06 billion
from $1.09 billion. The company closed on 3,865 homes in the
quarter, down 7 percent. Orders decreased 12 percent from a year
earlier. The average selling price rose 5 percent to $265,000.  ‘Middling Result’  “Overall this was a middling result given the relatively
solid orders offset by myriad charges,”  Stephen East , an
analyst with Ticonderoga Securities LLC in New York, wrote in a
note to clients.  PulteGroup fell 7.7 percent to $7.45 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange Composite trading, the biggest drop since
May 2009. The stock has tumbled 26 percent this year, more than
the 7.5 percent decline in the  Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Homebuilding Index .  The $3.3 billion purchase of Centex made PulteGroup the
nation’s largest construction company. Pulte said in November
2009 that the purchase would save the company $440 million a
year. The builders agreed to the deal in April 2009 after Centex
lost 70 percent of its market value in the previous 12 months
and Pulte lost 30 percent amid the U.S. housing crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
