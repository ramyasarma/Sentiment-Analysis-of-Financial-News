Imperial Holdings Ltd. will use the
724 million rand acquisition of CIC Holdings Ltd., which
provides retailers with merchandising services, to expand its
business in Africa, Chief Executive Officer Hubert Brody said.  Imperial may increase CIC’s presence on the continent in
“interesting markets” where it currently doesn’t operate, such
as Angola, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Kenya, Brody said in an
interview in Johannesburg today, after the company’s annual
general meeting.  Imperial remains acquisitive and expects to announce a
“small, bolt-on” acquisition in the next few months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
