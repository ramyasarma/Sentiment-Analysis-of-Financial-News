Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, advanced 39 percent in the latest week,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Arrivals totaled 94,452 bags in the period to Oct. 31,
according to a report from the Salvador, Brazil-based analyst
dated yesterday. That compares with the 67,736 bags he reported
a week earlier. Total arrivals from Brazil rose to 105,315 bags
from 83,747 bags. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia represents at least 70 percent of the country’s
output, Hartmann said on Sept. 2. He is a board member of the
Commercial Association of Bahia and is in charge of the group’s
statistical service on Brazilian cocoa output, according to an
e-mail that day.  The latest data on arrivals may be revised when two small
suppliers submit reports on deliveries, Hartmann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
