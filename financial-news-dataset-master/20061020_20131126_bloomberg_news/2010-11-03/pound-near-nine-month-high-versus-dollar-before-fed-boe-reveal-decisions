The pound gained versus the dollar
and the euro after a report showed U.K. services growth
unexpectedly accelerated in October, bolstering the view that
the Bank of England will keep its policy unchanged tomorrow.  Sterling climbed to a nine-month high against the dollar
before the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy
meeting today, when it’s forecast to announce a further $500
billion of Treasury purchases. The Bank of England will keep its
asset-purchase target at 200 billion pounds ($321 billion), a
separate survey showed.  “The Bank of England isn’t going to follow the Fed into
quantitative easing and that should be bullish for sterling,”
said  Geoff Kendrick , head of European foreign-exchange strategy
at Nomura International Plc. “We recommend buying the pound
against the euro.”  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.6099 as of 5:09 p.m. in
London after rising to $1.6156, the highest since Jan. 29. It
appreciated to 87.29 pence per euro from 87.48 pence yesterday.
Sterling strengthened 1.1 percent to 130.80 yen.  The  services gauge  rose to 53.2 from 52.8 in September,
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply said today. Economists forecast a decline to 52.6,
according to the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  Gilts Advance  U.K. government bonds advanced, pushing the yield on the
10-year gilt down four basis points to 3.00 percent. The 4.75
percent security due March 2020 gained 0.38, or 3.8 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 114.20. Two-year yields declined two
basis points to 0.67 percent.  Gilts advanced alongside German government bonds and
Treasuries as investors held on to safer assets ahead of the Fed
announcement, according to  Luca Jellinek , head of European
interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment
Bank in London.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc today pushed back its
forecast for the Bank of England to increase its bond-purchase
plan to February from November. The bank retains its positive
view on gilts.  “Our bullish gilts call wasn’t based solely on
quantitative easing coming this month,” said  Andy Chaytor , an
interest-rate strategist at RBS in London. “It doesn’t alter
the broad brush, but it does alter how they might perform near-
term.”  The 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of market expectation
of inflation derived from yield differences between nominal and
index-linked bonds, has narrowed to 2.82 percentage points from
2.84 percentage points last week, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
