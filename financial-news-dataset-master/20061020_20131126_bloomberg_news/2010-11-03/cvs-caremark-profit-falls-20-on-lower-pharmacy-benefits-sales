CVS Caremark Corp. , the largest
provider of prescription drugs in the U.S., said third-quarter
profit fell 20 percent after lower sales in its pharmacy-
benefits management division.  Net income declined to $820 million, or 59 cents a share,
from $1.02 billion, or 71 cents, the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-
based company said today in a statement. Sales fell 3.1 percent
to $23.9 billion.  CVS Caremark, led by Chief Executive Officer  Tom Ryan , cut
its annual profit forecast in July as some consumers deferred
medical treatment and legal expenses rose. The company lost
pharmacy-benefits management, or PBM, contracts valued at $4.8
billion for 2010.  PBMs make money by negotiating prices with retail
pharmacies and drugmakers and processing a large number of
claims. They pass most of those savings on to corporate,
government and insurance customers.  Sales at the PBM fell 8.5 percent to $11.9 billion. They
will decline as much as 9.5 percent this quarter, the company
said today on a conference call.  Analysts on average projected profit of 64 cents a share,
excluding some items, according to a Bloomberg survey. They
predicted sales of $23.9 billion.  Excluding some items, fourth-quarter profit will be 78
cents to 80 cents a share, the company said today on the
conference call. Profit for the year will be as much as $2.70,
down from a previous high target of $2.73.  Since the $27 billion acquisition of Caremark Rx Inc. in
2007, more than 24 states and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
have begun investigating the company over business practices.  CVS Caremark  rose 34 cents to $30.87 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 4.2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
