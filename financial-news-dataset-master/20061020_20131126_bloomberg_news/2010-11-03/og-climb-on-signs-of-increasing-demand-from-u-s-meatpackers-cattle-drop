Hog prices climbed for the second
straight day on signs of increasing U.S. demand. Cattle futures
declined.  Meatpackers processed an estimated 428,000 hogs today, up
0.7 percent from a week earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said. The price of  wholesale pork  rose 4.4 percent
in the past two days.  “Some packers are adding kills,” said  Tom Cawthorne , the
director of hog marketing at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in
Chicago. “That is going to clean up the backlog of hogs.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.575 cent, or 0.9
percent, to settle at 66.775 cents a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has gained 1.8
percent this year.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.55 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 97.7 cents a pound. The price has advanced 13
percent in 2010.  In the first two days of this week,  steers  for immediate
delivery at slaughterhouses averaged 97.78 cents a pound, down
3.2 percent from a week earlier, the USDA said. As of midday,
 wholesale choice beef  was down 0.5 percent this week, according
to government data.  In cattle, “the product trade is really flat this week,”
said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The early cash price
is “a little disappointing to market bulls,” he said.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.65
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.114 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
