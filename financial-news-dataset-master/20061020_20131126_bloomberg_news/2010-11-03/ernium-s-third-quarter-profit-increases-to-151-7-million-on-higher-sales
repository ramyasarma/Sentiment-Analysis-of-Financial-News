Ternium SA , the second-largest
steelmaker in Latin America, said profit rose 71 percent as
demand recovered from the worst recession in seven decades.  Net income climbed to $151.7 million, or 76 cents per
American depositary share, from $88.5 million, or 44 cents, a
year earlier, Ternium, based in Luxembourg, said today in a
statement.  Profit and sales plunged last year as the U.S. and other
countries struggled to recover from the global recession, the
deepest in 70 years. North America is Ternium’s largest market.  “Last year you were in the middle of the crisis, so it’s
obvious that year-on-year results will be better,”  Christian Reos , a Buenos Aires-based analyst with Allaria Ledesma, said in
a Nov. 1 telephone interview.  Ternium’s  third-quarter sales  increased 47 percent to $1.9
billion. Shipments rose 19 percent and revenue per ton gained 24
percent.  Ternium said it expects shipments to stay stable in coming
quarters compared with the third quarter, even as demand in
Latin America recovers. Increased prices for raw materials and
slabs in the second and third quarter are forecast to be passed
on in fourth-quarter costs, the company said.  Ternium fell 0.4 percent to $35.26 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The earnings report was released
after the closing of regular trading on North American markets.
The stock has gained 41 percent in the past year.  Latin America’s biggest steelmaker is Brazil’s  Gerdau SA.   To contact the reporter on this story:
