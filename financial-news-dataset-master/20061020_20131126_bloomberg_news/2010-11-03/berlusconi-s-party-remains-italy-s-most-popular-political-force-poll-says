Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
 People of Liberty  party is still Italy’s most popular political
grouping, according to a poll published in Il Sole 24 Ore.  The party would win 29.5 percent of the vote if elections
were held now, compared with 24 percent for the largest
opposition bloc, the  Democratic Party , the  Ipsos Srl poll 
published by the newspaper today showed. The results are about
the same as those from the most recent weekly poll by Ipsos, a
spokesman for the Milan-based research institute said.  The poll was carried out before media reports last week
that Berlusconi allegedly secured a 17-year-old woman’s release
from police custody in Milan. No margin of error was given for
the poll of 8,500 adults conducted between Oct. 10 and Oct. 28.  In a separate Ipsos poll of 800 adults broadcast yesterday
on RAI SpA state television, 45 percent said Berlusconi should
resign while 43 percent said he should remain in power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
