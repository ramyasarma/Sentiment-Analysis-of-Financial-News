Profit at  Telecom Argentina SA , the
country’s second-largest telephone company, rose 47 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier pushed by gains in its
Internet business.  Telecom had a  profit  of 444 million pesos ($112 million) in
the July-to-September period compared with 303 million pesos in
the same quarter of 2009,  Franco Bertone , the company’s chief
executive officer, told reporters in Buenos Aires today.  The Buenos Aires-based company had profit of 1.31 billion
pesos in the 9-month period, up from 1 billion a year earlier.  Overall sales rose 18 percent to 10.5 billion pesos in the
first nine months of the year, driven by a 31 percent gain in
the Arnet Internet business and a 22 percent gain in sales by
wireless service provider Personal, Bertone said. Net sales rose
21 percent in the third quarter to 3.77 billion pesos, he said.  Telecom’s  shares  on the benchmark Merval index climbed 4.2
percent, the biggest increase since Sept. 28, to 19.80 pesos.
The shares are up 56.5 percent this year, compared with a 38
percent gain for the Merval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
