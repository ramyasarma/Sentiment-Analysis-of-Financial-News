Registered unemployment  in Spain,
which has Europe’s highest jobless rate, rose for the third
month in October as the economy struggles to recover from an
almost two-year  recession .  The number of people registering for unemployment benefits
rose by 68,213, or 1.7 percent, from September to 4.09 million,
the  Labor Ministry  in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Spain’s  unemployment rate , double the European average,
fell in the third quarter to 19.8 percent, even as Prime
Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  said the number should be
viewed with “prudence.” The  economic  recovery probably slowed
from July to September, Bank of Spain Governor  Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez  said on Oct. 5, as the government tries to
slash the euro region’s third-largest budget  deficit  with the
deepest austerity measures in at least three decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
