Transocean Ltd. , owner of the rig
that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April, said profit fell
for a seventh consecutive quarter, the longest streak of
declines in at least a decade, amid faltering demand for
drilling vessels.  Net income fell 48 percent to $368 million, or $1.15 a
share, during the third quarter, from $710 million, or $2.19, a
year earlier, the Vernier, Switzerland-based company said in a
statement. Excluding costs stemming from the April disaster,
taxes and debt retirement, per-share profit was 3 cents higher
than the average estimate of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Demand for drilling rigs  in U.S. waters tumbled 47 percent
during the July-to-September period amid a surfeit of natural
gas and a temporary moratorium on deep-water exploration. Almost
one-third of Transocean’s fleet is inactive, a public filing
showed last month. The company is receiving lower daily fees for
some of its most-sophisticated rigs as explorers such as Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  await the
resumption of deep-water drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico.  The statement was released after the close of regular U.S.
stock trading. Transocean fell 21 cents to $63.75 at 5:08 p.m.
The shares have fallen 31 percent since the April 20 explosion
of the company’s Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf while under
contract to BP Plc.  Insurance Premiums  The disaster killed 11 rig workers, injured 17 and
triggered the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Interior
Secretary  Kenneth Salazar  lifted a ban last month on exploratory
drilling in seas deeper than 500 feet (152 meters) that had been
imposed in response to the April tragedy.  Sales dropped 18 percent to $2.31 billion. The third-
quarter results included $22 million in after-tax costs related
to legal expenses, an internal investigation, increased
insurance premiums and professional fees stemming from the April
20 disaster, the statement said.  The company said it also had $43 million in after-tax costs
associated with debt retirement, legal matters unrelated to the
Gulf catastrophe and tax items.  The average daily rate for the company’s most-sophisticated
rigs fell by 7.8 percent to $422,800 from a year earlier, the
statement said. Utilization of Transocean’s vessels declined to
64 percent from 75 percent during the third quarter of 2009.  New Rigs  Transocean operates 139 floating rigs, the world’s largest
fleet. The company has three deep-water vessels under
construction that are under contract to work for  Exxon Mobil
Corp. , Reliance Industries Ltd. and BP when they are finished,
Transocean said in an Oct. 14 public filing.  Two of the new rigs, the Discoverer Luanda and the
Discoverer India, are scheduled to begin operations by the end
of this year, according to the filing. The Deepwater Champion is
expected to leave the shipyard during the first quarter of 2011
to work for Exxon in the Black Sea.  The rates to lease the new vessels range from $430,000 a
day to $703,000 a day, Transocean said.  (Transocean scheduled a conference call to discuss third-
quarter results for 10 a.m. New York time tomorrow. To access
