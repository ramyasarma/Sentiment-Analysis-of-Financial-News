A U.K. index of hiring for permanent
jobs in October showed the slowest pace of growth in 14 months,
KPMG LLP and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.  The gauge of full-time job placements dropped to 52.6 from
54.6 in September, the groups said in an e-mailed report today
in London. Readings above 50 indicate an increase in hiring.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  last month
unveiled plans for the deepest spending cuts since World War II,
which will lead to the loss of almost half a million public
sector jobs. U.K.  unemployment  claims climbed the most in eight
months in September.  “The overall outlook for the U.K. job market deteriorated
in October,” Bernard Brown, head of business services at KPMG,
said in the statement. “At the moment the private sector is not
creating new jobs in sufficient numbers to offset this public-
sector downturn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
