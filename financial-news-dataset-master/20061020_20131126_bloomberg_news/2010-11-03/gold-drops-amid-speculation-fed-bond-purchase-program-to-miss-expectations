Gold may decline in London on
speculation that a second round of quantitative easing by the
Federal Reserve may miss investors’ expectations.  The Fed today will likely pledge to buy $500 billion or
more in securities, according to 29 of 56 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. The dollar may strengthen as the Fed announces a
smaller increase in asset purchases than many investors expect,
Barclays Capital strategist  Aroop Chatterjee  said yesterday.
Barclays forecast purchases of $60 billion a month for six
months. Gold usually moves inversely to the greenback.  “Pressure could be applied by the possibility that the
quantitative easing implementation is smaller than
anticipated,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at  MF  Global Holdings
Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report.  Immediate-delivery bullion lost $2.90, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,354.55 an ounce at 9:21 a.m. in London. Prices reached a
record $1,387.35 on Oct. 14. The metal for December delivery was
0.2 percent lower at $1,354.50 on the Comex in New York. Futures
reached a record $1,388.10 on Oct. 14.  Gold, up 23 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. Precious
metals have outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most
industrial metals this year as central banks maintained low
interest rates and governments spent trillions of dollars to
spur growth.  The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in debt from December 2008 to
March. Concern about possible further monetary easing in the
U.S. has supported gold prices. The dollar was little changed
against the euro today.  ‘Negative Impact’  “Talk of quantitative easing has already been reflected in
gold prices,” said Seo Jun Mo, a senior trader at KB Futures
Co. in Seoul, referring to the Fed’s possible bond purchases. If
the amount “falls short of market expectations, that will have
a negative impact on gold.”  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products declined for a 13th
day yesterday, falling 0.87 metric ton to 2,086.53 tons,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  A gold deposit with proven reserves of at least 100 tons
has been found in China’s Inner Mongolia region, Xinhua News
Agency reported today, citing Huang Zhiquan, chief engineer of
the armed police detachment in charge of minerals exploration.  Silver for immediate delivery in London lost 0.3 percent to
$24.825 an ounce. The metal climbed to a 30-year high of
$25.0525 on Nov. 1. It reached an all-time high of $50.35 in New
York in 1980, a year after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the
market.  Palladium fell 0.7 percent to $640.90 an ounce after
yesterday reaching $657.50 for a second day, matching the
highest price since May 2001. Platinum declined 0.3 percent to
$1,713.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
