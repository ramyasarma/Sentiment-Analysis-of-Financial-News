Cricket South Africa, the national
governing body for the sport, said it has asked for legal
counsel on a book written by batsman Herschelle Gibbs.  Cricket South Africa won’t comment further on the book
until it has “taken a view or decision on the matter.”  Gibbs’ “To The Point” book details his own behavior as
well as that of fellow members of the national team on
tours of Australia and New Zealand. It also discusses relations
between players in the team and former manager Mickey Arthur.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
