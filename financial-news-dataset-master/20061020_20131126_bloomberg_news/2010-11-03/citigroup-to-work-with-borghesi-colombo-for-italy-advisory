Citigroup Inc. , the U.S. bank that
operates in more than 140 countries, said it will work with
advisory firm Borghesi Colombo & Associati to expand its
investment-banking business in Italy.  “With this agreement, Citi benefits from Borghesi
Colombo’s longstanding experience, relationships and execution
capabilities in the Italian market,” the New York-based bank
said in a statement today. The two companies will continue to
operate independently.  Citigroup ranks sixth this year in advising on mergers and
acquisitions involving Italian companies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The top arranger, Morgan Stanley, advised
on $24.7 billion of deals, compared with Citigroup’s $22.6
billion, the data shows.  Citigroup is expanding internationally to counter shrinking
revenue. The bank said last month that income from investment
banking in the third quarter tumbled 20 percent to $930 million.  Arnaldo Borghesi , founder of Milan-based Borghesi Colombo,
is a former Lazard Ltd. banker. His firm has 16 employees
dedicated to advisory services, focusing on corporate finance,
business strategy and corporate governance. The company advised
Tiscali SpA on a possible sale in 2008 and is helping  Kerself
SpA , Italy’s biggest maker of photovoltaic cells, review its
business structure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
