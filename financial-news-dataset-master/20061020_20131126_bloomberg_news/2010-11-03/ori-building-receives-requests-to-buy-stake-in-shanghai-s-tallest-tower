(Corrects title of Mori Building official in first
paragraph.)  Mori Building Co. received a “few
requests” from potential investors to buy part of its Shanghai
World Financial Center, Michiho Kishi, a spokesman for the unit
that manages the tower, said in an interview from Shanghai today.  The company is considering whether to sell a “minor
portion” of the building and there’s no decision yet on the
timing and the size, he said.  Mori Building plans to sell part of the Shanghai tower for
between 40 billion yen ($496 million) and 50 billion yen to
recoup development costs, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
