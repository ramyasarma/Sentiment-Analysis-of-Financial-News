Job cuts announced by U.S. employers
fell in October from a year earlier, signaling that a lack of
hiring rather than an increase in firings is restraining the
labor market.  Planned firings  dropped 32 percent to 37,986 last month
from 55,679 in October 2009, according to Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.  While companies are cutting fewer workers from payrolls,
jobs aren’t being added fast enough to further boost consumer
spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.
Federal Reserve policy makers, concerned demand isn’t strong
enough to reduce a jobless rate near 10 percent, may announce
today another round of monetary policy easing.  “Job cuts are the lowest they have been in a decade,”
 John A. Challenger , chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray
& Christmas, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the lack of
spending by consumers and businesses is stunting demand for new
workers.”  Compared with September, job-cut announcements rose 2.2
percent. Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal
effects, economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes
rather than monthly numbers.  Entertainment and leisure firms led the October job cuts
with 5,059 announced reductions, the largest in that industry
since July 2008, according to Challenger. Government and non-
profit agencies had the next-largest number of cuts, with 4,749.  New York led all states with 7,363 announced job cuts,
followed by New Jersey, with 5,410.  Hiring Plans  Today’s report also showed that employers announced plans
in October to hire 124,766 workers, up from 123,076 the prior
month. Retail and transportation companies led the gains,
planning to add 66,000 and 50,300 positions, respectively.  Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. , the world’s biggest toy retailer, is
among companies announcing hiring plans in recent months to
prepare for the holiday shopping season. Toys ‘R’ Us said in
September it will look to hire about 45,000 employees to cope
with holiday demand.  Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins Inc., a maker of
cockpit instruments and radios, last week said it will add 800
people, boosting staff by 4 percent during the next 12 months.
Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S. automaker, said it will
spend $850 million and add 1,200 jobs in Michigan by 2013 as
sales rebound.  A report from the Labor Department later this week may show
companies added 80,000 jobs in October, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The jobless
rate probably held at 9.6 percent, the survey showed.  Federal Reserve  Investors are anticipating Fed policy makers will restart a
program to purchase securities to spur growth, reduce
unemployment and increase inflation, according to 53 of 56
economists surveyed last week by Bloomberg. A majority said the
Fed will pledge to buy $500 billion or more. Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said on Aug. 27 that the central bank “will do all it
can” to sustain the recovery.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
