EDP Renovaveis SA, the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said nine-month profit declined 68 percent as financial costs
doubled after it invested in new projects.  Net income fell to 22.2 million euros ($31 million) from 70
million euros a year earlier, the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said
today in a regulatory filing. Financial costs increased to 120
million euros from 61 million euros in the same period of last
year as net debt increased to 2.9 billion euros.  EDP Renovaveis plans to install 1.1 gigawatts of capacity
in 2010, and said it’s adjusting its planned annual capacity
additions for 2011 and 2012 to between 0.8 and 0.9 gigawatts a
year, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
