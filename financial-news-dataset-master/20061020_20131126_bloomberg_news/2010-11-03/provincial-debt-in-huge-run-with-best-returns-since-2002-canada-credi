Canada’s provincial bonds are headed
for the highest returns since 2002, beating other fixed-income
classes, as investors speculate the debt is undervalued on a
historical basis and to the regions’ economic prospects.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canadian Provincial and
Municipal Index, with C$469 billion ($464 billion) outstanding,
have returned 8 percent this year, including reinvested
interest. That’s an annualized return of 9.6 percent, the most
since 2002’s 10 percent gain.  Average long-term spreads on 10-year bonds of Ontario,
Quebec and British Columbia, Canada’s three largest provinces,
were 40 basis points over federal benchmarks before the
financial crisis. That compares with 80 basis points to 110
basis points now, Montreal-based BCA Research said on its
 website . Canada’s output is the highest among major economies,
Bloomberg data show.  Spreads on provincial bonds at more than double long-term
averages are “unjustified given the favorable fiscal outlook in
all provinces,” BCA said in its report, citing stable ratings
outlook, ample liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads. “The
implication is that spreads in the 10-year area have more
potential to narrow.”  “We’ve had a huge run,”  Benoit Lalonde , vice president of
fixed income in Montreal at Laurentian Bank of Canada, said by
phone. “The returns are due to the tightening of provincial
spreads. Spreads are still pretty wide on a historical basis.”  QE2 Positive  Treasury  yields  dropped along with the U.S. currency during
the past three months on speculation Federal Reserve policy
makers will announce more asset purchases today under a second
round of the policy known as quantitative easing, or QE2, aimed
at stimulating the world’s largest economy.  “We hope QE2 is a positive for the market,” Lalonde said.
“If that’s the case, provincial bonds are going to have a very,
very good period.” As long as the U.S. 10-year Treasury  yield 
stays below 2.85 percent, relative yields in provincial bonds
will stay low, boosting the sector’s returns, he said.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of Canada’s corporations instead of its
federal government tightened to 142 basis points, or 1.42
percentage points, wider than the 139 basis points a year ago,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The so-called
spread in U.S. corporate bonds ended Nov. 1 at 179 basis points.
Global corporate bonds stood at 165 basis points. Both widened 1
basis point from the end of last week.  Corporate Yields  Canadian corporate yields ended yesterday at 3.67 percent,
from 3.65 the day before and 3.66 at the end of September,
according to the Merrill index, which holds more than 700 bonds
with a par value of C$278 billion. The index is headed for a 9.2
percent return this year, versus 15 percent last year.  Livingston International , a Toronto-based customs
brokerage, sold C$135 million of 10.125 percent bonds due in
November 2015. The debt priced to yield 813.6 basis points over
benchmarks.  Companies have issued C$62 billion in Canadian-dollar debt
this year, the most since 2007, when sales were C$77 billion
through Nov. 2, according to Bloomberg data.  Merrill’s broad index of provincial bonds yielded 3 percent
yesterday, from 2.97 percent the day before. Yields fell to
2.897 percent on Oct. 19, the lowest since at least 1992, from
above 9 percent in 1994.  Financement Quebec  Financement Quebec, which seeks loans on behalf of schools,
universities and hospitals, reoffered C$100 million of its bonds
due in June 2016, with a floating-rate coupon set quarterly at
27 basis points greater than the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate
known as CDOR. The issue has C$1.05 billion outstanding.  Halifax International Airport sold C$135 million of 4.89
percent bonds maturing in November 2050. The debt priced to
yield 140 basis points over benchmarks.  The benchmark Canadian 10-year bond’s yield dropped 2 basis
points to 2.85 percent as the 3.5 percent security due in June
2020 climbed 16 cents to C$105.39.  The benchmark two-year note’s  yield  was little changed at
1.41 percent, after reaching 1.45 percent on Oct. 27, the
highest level in a month. The 1.5 percent bond maturing in
December 2012 traded at C$100.18. The 30-year’s yield fell 2
basis points to 3.47 percent.  Canadian government bonds have returned 7 percent this
year, headed for an 8.4 percent annual return, the most since
2008. U.S. Treasuries are headed for a 10.4 percent return in
2010, compared with 6.9 percent for global government bonds.  Debt Sale  Canada will sell C$3.5 billion of five-year bonds at
auction today, the central bank said on its website. The bonds
will mature in June 2016. The previous auction  of five-year
bonds on Aug. 18 drew an average yield of 2.26 percent with a
bid to cover ratio of 2.25 times.  Merrill’s Canada High Yield Index, comprising 16 bonds with
a par value of C$4.4 billion, has returned 20 percent this year,
compared with an index of global high-yield bonds, which is up
15 percent. The two indexes returned 32 percent and 60 percent,
respectively, last year.  Spreads on Merrill’s provincial index, which includes bonds
from Canada’s 10 provinces, municipalities such as Toronto,
Montreal and Vancouver, and agencies including Canada Post Corp.
and Canada Housing Trust, dropped to 53 basis points yesterday,
from 71 basis points in May, at the height of concern about
European deficits. Spreads have averaged about 31 basis points
on a quarterly closing basis, Merrill data since 1992 show.  International investors purchased a net C$9.9 billion of
provincial debt in the three months through June, the most in a
quarter since 1988, according to Statistics Canada. Inflows
totaled C$13.9 billion through August, compared with C$15.7
billion in all of 2009, which saw the highest annual tally since
1993’s C$17.5 billion in positive flows, the agency’s data show.  ‘Greater Interest’  “The greater interest in Canadian dollar assets has helped
increase the size and diversity in the provincial market, which
has certainly contributed to provincial bonds recent
performance,”  Marc Rouleau , a fund manager at Standard Life
Investments in Montreal who helps manage about C$20 billion in
fixed-income assets.  Among provinces, returns were highest last month for the
bonds of Prince Edward Island at 0.8 percent and Quebec at 0.7
percent, according to the Merrill data. Alberta at 0.47 percent
and Manitoba at 0.53 percent had the lowest returns.  Debt of Ontario, the largest issuer among the 10 provinces,
returned 0.6 percent last month. The yield on the province’s 4.2
percent bond due in June 2020 rose 4 basis points yesterday, as
the price declined 30 cents to C$104.97. It has returned 8.5
percent from Feb. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
