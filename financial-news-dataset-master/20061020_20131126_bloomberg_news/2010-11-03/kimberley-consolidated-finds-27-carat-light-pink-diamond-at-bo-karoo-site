Kimberley Consolidated Mining Ltd. , a
South African diamond miner, said that a subcontractor working
at its Bo Karoo mining site in the country’s Northern Cape
province found a 27 carat light pink diamond yesterday.  The diamond will be sold at tender after it has been
cleaned, KPM said in a statement released on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange today. The Kimberley-based company will pay 15
percent of the value of the gem to the subcontractor.  “The last time a pink diamond of this quality was found
was about four years ago and that fetched $58,000 a carat on
tender,” company Chief Financial Officer  Riaan Visser  said in a
telephone interview from Kimberley today. “It is not the size
so much as the quality of the pink color that is significant.”  Kimberley Consolidated was suspended from trading shares on
the JSE in July 2009, according to a report it released at the
time.  The find will “hopefully change KCM’s financial situation
so that we comply with the listing requirements of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange,” Visser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
