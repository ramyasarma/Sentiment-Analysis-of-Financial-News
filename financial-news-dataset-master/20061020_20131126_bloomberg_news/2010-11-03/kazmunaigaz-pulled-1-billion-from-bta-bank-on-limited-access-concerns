KazMunaiGaz National Co. , a Kazakh
state-owned oil and gas producer, withdrew $1 billion from BTA
Bank in September on concerns that access to its deposit was
“limited,” and used the money to redeem bonds and make loans.  Although KazMunaiGaz bank deposits “were not at any time
legally frozen, the company’s management believed that the
access to the deposits was limited in practice,” KazMunaiGaz
said today in a  prospectus  for a $7.5 billion bond program
published on the Kazakhstan Stock exchange website.  KazMunaiGaz had deposits of $8.2 billion in Kazakh banks as
of June 30, including $3.4 billion in Halyk Bank, $2.6 billion
in Kazkommertsbank and $1 billion in BTA, the energy company
said. KazMunaiGaz reduced its deposits as of Sept. 30 to $7.2
billion, including $2.6 billion with Kazkommertsbank, $2.4
billion with Halyk and nothing at BTA.  The National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna took control of
BTA, the nation’s largest lender at the time, and bought stakes
in Kazkommertsbank and Halyk Savings Bank in early 2009 after
credit markets froze and Kazakhstan’s property bubble burst.
Three of four defaulted Kazakh lenders -- BTA, Temirbank and
Alliance Bank -- reached restructuring deals with creditors,
allowing them to write down debt of about $11 billion.  Restructuring Efforts  “The restructured banks are in the early stages of their
post-restructuring operations, however, and there can be no
assurance that the restructuring efforts in respect of the
Kazakhstan financial sector will ultimately be wholly successful
and that the banks with which the company has deposits, and
possibly others, will, accordingly, not become bankrupt,”
KazMunaiGaz said.  KazMunaiGaz didn’t respond to an e-mailed response to
questions about the deposits today.  Adil Dosymov , an Almaty-
based spokesman for BTA Bank, declined to comment immediately.  KazMunaiGaz’s withdrawals from BTA have been offset by an
inflow of corporate deposits from other companies, said  Milena Ivanova-Venturini , head of research for Central Asia at the
Almaty unit of Moscow-based Renaissance Capital.  “So it may be that while KazMunaiGaz has been withdrawing
money, other state-related entities have more than offset such
withdrawals,” Ivanova-Venturini said. “Therefore I wouldn’t
question the commitment of the state to BTA.”  KazMunaiGaz’s withdrawal of funds “tells us, at least at
face value, that the fear of some investors that the company’s
money is effectively locked up in Kazakh banks may be
exaggerated at this point in time,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
