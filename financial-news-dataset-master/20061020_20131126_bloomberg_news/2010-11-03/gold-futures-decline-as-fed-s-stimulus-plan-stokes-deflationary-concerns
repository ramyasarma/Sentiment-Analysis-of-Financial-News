Gold fell, extending earlier losses,
after the Federal Reserve said it plans to ease monetary policy
further to avert deflation.  The central bank said it would buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June and pledged to keep the benchmark
interest close to zero percent for an “extended period.” Gold
gained 3.7 percent last month, reaching a record $1,388.10 an
ounce on Oct. 14, as the Fed’s so-called quantitative easing
drove the dollar lower.  “The reality is that the gold market had already priced in
the easing, and now it has to deal with deflationary worries,”
said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services in Chicago. “With deflation, initially, you have a
general devaluation in all asset classes before money goes back
into gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped as much as
$31.40, or 2.3 percent, to $1,325.50 an ounce at 2:28 p.m. in
electronic trading on the Comex in New York following the
announcement. At the end of floor trading, the most-active
contract settled at $1,337.60, down 1.4 percent from yesterday.  The price was at $1,344.10 at 3:18 p.m., down 0.9 percent
from yesterday’s settlement.  The Fed has already purchased $1.7 trillion in Treasuries
and mortgage-backed assets to spur growth.  Fifty-three of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
last week predicted the central bank would announce asset
purchases today with 29 forecasting a pledge to buy $500 billion
or more.  “This isn’t far off from the money,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at Futurepath Trading LLC in Chicago. “This amount isn’t
big enough to really propel gold higher. It’s not something
that’s going to bring everybody into the gold market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
