Andreessen Horowitz LLC , the venture
capital firm run by Netscape Communications Corp. founder  Marc Andreessen , said it raised $650 million for a second fund to
invest in startups.  Andreessen Horowitz, co-founded last year by Andreessen and
 Ben Horowitz , has previously invested in companies such as Skype
Technologies SA and Foursquare, which makes software that lets
people locate their friends.  The Menlo Park, California-based firm said it plans to
invest in similar startups with the new funds it raised.
Andreessen, 39, and Horowitz, 44, started out with a $300
million fund last year.  Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, is an
investor in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
