Copper prices fell for the first time
in three days as traders bet that better-than-expected U.S. jobs
data would weaken the case for additional stimulus money.  Companies in the U.S. added 43,000 workers, more than twice
economists’ estimates, an ADP Employer Services report today
showed. Copper dropped as much as 2 percent. The metal pared
losses in electronic trading after the Federal Reserve said it
will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June
to boost economic growth.  “The market is a bit skittish,” said  Rich Ilczyszyn , a
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago, before
the Fed announcement. “Fundamentally, nothing has changed.”  Copper futures for December delivery fell 5.4 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close at $3.785 a pound at 1:26 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. The metal traded at $3.7925 at 2:44 p.m. The price
climbed 2.8 percent in the previous two days.  Before the Fed report, economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News said policy makers would probably announce a plan to
purchase at least $500 billion of long-term securities.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $115, or 1.4 percent, to $8,320 a metric ton
($3.77 a pound). Zinc, lead and aluminum also fell on the LME,
while nickel and tin gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
