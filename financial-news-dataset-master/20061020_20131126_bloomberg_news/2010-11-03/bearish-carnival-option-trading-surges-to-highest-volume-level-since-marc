Bearish  Carnival Corp.  options
trading rose to the highest since March as investors boosted
bets that the world’s biggest cruise-line operator will retreat
by next month and pare this year’s 37 percent gain.  Almost 12,000 puts to sell the stock changed hands as of 4
p.m. in New York, six times the four-week average and triple the
number of calls to buy shares. The Miami-based company rose 0.5
percent to $43.57. Almost half of  the put volume  was
concentrated in December $42 puts.  “These investors are likely expecting downside in the
stock between now and December expiration,” strategists at Bala
Cynwyd, Pennsylvania-based Susquehanna International Group LLP
wrote in a report to clients.  The stock traded  below $42  for most of the past six months
until Oct. 26, when Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the second-
largest cruise operator, said strengthening ticket prices may
help it post record earnings next year. Carnival raised its
fiscal 2010 forecast on Sept. 21, citing lower fuel costs to
operate cruises and strengthening ticket prices.  Ninety-two percent of the December $42 puts changed hands
on the ask price, and they had an open interest of 206 existing
contracts before today, which are indications that buyers of new
bearish positions accounted for almost all of the volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
