The Australian dollar rose to the
strongest in more than six years against its Canadian
counterpart after Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40
billion hostile takeover bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc. was blocked by Canada’s government.  The Australian currency climbed to C$1.0183, the most since
April 2004, and traded at C$1.0142 as of 9:05 a.m. in Sydney
from C$1.0115 yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
