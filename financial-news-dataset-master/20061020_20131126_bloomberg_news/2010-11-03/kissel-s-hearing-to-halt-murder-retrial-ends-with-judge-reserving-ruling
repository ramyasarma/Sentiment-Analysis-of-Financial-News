A Hong Kong judge today reserved
judgment on  Nancy Kissel ’s request for a ruling that she can’t
get a fair retrial for the 2003 killing of her  Merrill Lynch &
Co.  banker husband.  Judge Andrew Macrae said he hoped to issue his decision by
the end of this month on Kissel’s application for a permanent
stay of proceedings. He ordered the media not to report on the
details of the hearing on its first day on Nov. 1.  Michigan-born Kissel, 46, won a retrial when Hong Kong’s
top court overturned her 2005 conviction for murdering her
husband Robert. The mother of three is serving a life sentence
in prison and could be freed if her application for a stay is
successful.  Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal said in February that
Kissel’s conviction was flawed because the judge wrongly allowed
hearsay evidence and prosecutors improperly questioned her
during the trial. Jurors heard in the three-month trial that she
drugged her husband with a milkshake, bludgeoned him to death
and hid his body in a carpet.  The case is Nancy Ann Kissel and HKSAR, HCCC55/2010, Hong
Kong Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
