Canaccord Financial Inc. , Canada’s
largest independent brokerage by assets, said second-quarter
profit rose 45 percent on an increase in investment banking.  Profit for the period ended Sept. 30 rose to C$9.7 million
($9.6 million), or 12 cents a share, from C$6.7 million, or 12
cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based brokerage said today in
a statement. Revenue rose 21 percent to C$149.3 million from
C$123.7 million.  Canaccord benefited from higher fees from arranging stock
sales and advising companies on mergers and acquisitions from a
year earlier, before its takeover of Genuity Capital Markets.
Canaccord bought Toronto-based Genuity in April for C$285.9
million.  Profit matched the 12-cents-a-share net income estimate by
Macquarie Capital Markets analyst  Sumit Malhotra .  Canaccord fell 38 cents, or 3.5 percent, to C$10.40 at the
4 p.m. close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
biggest drop in two months.  The firm advised on eight takeovers worth $1.1 billion that
closed in the quarter, according to Bloomberg data. The
brokerage managed 27 stock sales worth $370.1 million, more than
double a year earlier.  Chief Executive Officer  Paul Reynolds  said today in a
conference call with analysts that Canaccord has a “strong
pipeline of transactions” after “the start of an incredible
turnaround” in trading activity and market performance in
September.  Reynolds said he sees “significant opportunities” in
China, where Canaccord is evaluating “several promising entry
points.” He also targeted C$20 million of cost cutting in the
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
