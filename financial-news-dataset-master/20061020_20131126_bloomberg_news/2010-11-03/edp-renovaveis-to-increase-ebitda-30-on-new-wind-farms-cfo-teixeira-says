EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) ,  Portugal ’s biggest
wind farm owner, may increase earnings by about 30 percent this
year as it adds new generators in the U.S., Spain and  Poland ,
Chief Financial Officer Rui Teixeira said.  Teixeira said he’s “comfortable” the company can meet the
median analyst forecast for earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of about 710 million euros ($996
million) this year, compared with 543 million euros in 2009.  The company will add about 400 megawatts of new capacity in
the fourth quarter to meet its target of a full-year increase of
about 1.1 gigawatts, Teixeira said. This year’s higher earnings
will be driven by new capacity which was commissioned earlier
this year and in the last months of last 2009, he added.  “We are delivering the expansion we had committed to,” he
said today in an interview in Madrid.  Renovaveis, based in Oviedo,  Spain , today reported nine-
month profit declined 68 percent. Financial costs doubled in the
period after it invested in new projects and the U.S.
experienced 13 percent less wind that usual.  U.S. output will likely pick up in the final three months
of the year as generators already saw 3 percent more wind than
the average in October, Teixeira said.  The company is staying on target to meet its Ebitda goal
set in May for average annual growth of about 30 percent between
2009 and 2012.  The company’s shares fell 3 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 4.18
euros, in Lisbon trading as of 12:18 p.m. In comparison, the
WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
