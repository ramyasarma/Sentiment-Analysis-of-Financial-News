Russia’s service industries grew at
the fastest pace since June last month, the second consecutive
monthly increase after a contraction caused by a heatwave, HSBC
Holdings Plc said.  The seasonally adjusted Business Activity Index rose to
55.6 in October from 51.5 in September, HSBC said in a report
today, citing data compiled by Markit Economics. The survey-
based index indicates a contraction when it is below 50 and
growth with a figure above 50.  Russia’s economic recovery from last year’s 7.9 percent
contraction, the biggest on record, remains moderate, the bank
said.  The economy completely awakened in October from the
“summer nap,” said  Alexander Morozov,  HSBC’s chief economist
in Moscow, in the statement. “Yet we still talk about the
return of the economy to moderate growth rates, which are lower
than the multi-year average.”  Gross domestic product may expand by as little as 3.6
percent in 2010, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said on
Sept. 24. The government left its official GDP forecast for this
year unchanged at 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
