Gold fell the most in two weeks on
bets that the Federal Reserve will announce a U.S. stimulus
below estimates by economists, boosting the dollar and eroding
the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment.  Before today, gold gained 8.7 percent since Sept. 1, while
the dollar dropped 7 percent against a basket of major
currencies amid speculation that policy makers will announce
another round of so-called quantitative easing to bolster the
economy. The metal reached a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct.
14.  “You’ve got nervous longs exiting this market,” said
 Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “If the Fed disappoints with a smaller amount of
quantitative easing, you might start to see the dollar gain, and
gold is going to go down.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped $19.30, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1,337.60 at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Oct.
19. Earlier, the metal climbed as much as 0.6 percent.  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased $1.7
trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed assets to spur
growth.  Estimates for the size of the Fed’s next round of asset
purchases range from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at
both firms agree the Fed may start by announcing a $500 billion
plan.  An announcement is expected at 2:15 p.m. in Washington.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 40 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $24.436 an ounce.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $21.90, or 1.3
percent, to $1,697.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery declined $2.75, or
0.4 percent, to $642.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
