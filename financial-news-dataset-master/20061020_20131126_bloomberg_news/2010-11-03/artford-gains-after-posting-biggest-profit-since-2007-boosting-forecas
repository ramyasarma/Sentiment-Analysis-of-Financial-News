Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc.  surged the most in a year of New York trading after
reporting its biggest profit since 2007 and boosting its 2010
earnings forecast.  The insurer rose $2.15, or 9.2 percent, to $25.57 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, making it the
biggest gainer today in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Third-
quarter  net income  of $666 million, or $1.34 a share, compares
with a loss of $220 million, or 79 cents, a year earlier,
according to a statement late yesterday from Hartford, which is
based in the Connecticut city of the same name. Core earnings
this year may be $2.60 to $2.70 a share, Hartford said, up from
the previous projection of $2.10 to $2.30.  Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee , hired in October 2009,
returned Hartford to profit last year as stock and bond rallies
boosted the value of holdings and reduced liabilities to
customers on equity-linked retirement products. Hartford’s
rating was upgraded to “neutral” from “sell” last week by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on the “greater command” managers had
on the insurer’s capital needs.  “There was significant improvement in the quality of our
investment portfolio,” McGee said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “Our losses and impairments were at levels close to
what we had pre-crisis.”  Bond Rebound  The investment portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $1.2
billion as of Sept. 30, compared with a net unrealized loss of
$1.5 billion at the end of June. The figures, reflecting market
fluctuations that aren’t counted toward earnings, are monitored
by investors and rating firms as a gauge of financial strength.
 Book value per share,  a measure of assets minus liabilities, was
$45.80, an 11 percent improvement from about $41.29 on June 30.  Investment income rose 3 percent to $1.1 billion, led by an
$81 million improvement in returns on alternative investments,
which typically include private equity and hedge funds.  Hartford had trimmed its earnings forecast in August. The
company said then, in its second-quarter profit report, that
earnings may be $2.10 to $2.30 a share this year, less than
previous guidance of $2.70 to $3.  “Last quarter we had a goodwill charge, we had an asbestos
charge, we had several charges that were one-time charges,”
McGee said in the interview. “This quarter we had a much better
quarter than we anticipated, so we were able to increase our
guidance.”  Interest Rates  The company will “evaluate guidance and how we use it in
2011,” he said.  Hartford posted third-quarter core earnings of $1.43 a
share, or 98 cents excluding the impact of special items
including a release of reserves. That met the average profit
 estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Interest rates aren’t likely to rise in the “near-term,”
McGee said today during a conference call. If they remain at
current levels through 2012, it could cost the company about
$130 million, executives said on the call.  Hartford, which sells life insurance  as well as  property-
casualty coverage, has scaled back business outside the U.S. and
curbed the sale of variable annuities, the equity-based
retirement products that produced losses when  stock markets  fell
in 2008 and early 2009. Credit losses in the second half will be
similar to those in the first as the “worst is behind us” on
writedowns, McGee said in August.  ‘Right the Ship’  “The equity markets strengthened, which helps Hartford in
both their variable annuities business and their investments,”
said  Drew Woodbury , a Morningstar Inc. analyst in Chicago.
“They’re trying to right the ship and make some good steps.”  McGee, 56,  raised  more than $2.5 billion selling stock and
debt in March to exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program. McGee’s
predecessor as CEO,  Ramani Ayer , secured the aid package that
ranked Hartford second to  American International Group Inc. 
among bailed-out U.S. insurers.  The Treasury Department raised $706.3 million in September
by selling 52.1 million warrants it received as compensation for
the risks taken with taxpayer dollars. The warrants entitle
holders to purchase Hartford stock at $9.79 a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
