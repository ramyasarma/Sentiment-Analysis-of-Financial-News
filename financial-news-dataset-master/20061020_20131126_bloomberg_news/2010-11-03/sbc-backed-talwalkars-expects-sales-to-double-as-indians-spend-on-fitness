Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd. ,
backed by HSBC Holdings Plc, expects annual sales to almost
double as economic growth in the world’s second-most populous
nation lifts spending on health and wellbeing.  Annual sales may rise to 1.3 billion rupees ($29.3 million)
in the year ending March 31 from 661 million in the previous
period, Chief Financial Officer  Anant Gawande  said in an
interview yesterday. The  gym  operator, based in Mumbai, will
open 23 new centers by March taking the total to 100 across 55
Indian cities, he said.  “We are going to see high growth this year and next
because we are going to get the realizations from our spending
on building gyms,” Gawande said.  Talwalkar shares rose 1.2 percent to 260.50 rupees in
Mumbai as of 10:35 a.m., following a 9 percent surge yesterday.
The stock has doubled since its debut on May 10, compared with a
22 percent gain in the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange  Sensitive
Index  in the same period.  The company, which raised 774 million rupees selling 6.05
million shares at 128 rupees apiece in its initial offer, plans
to open gyms in cities with a population of more than 600,000
people where prospects for health and fitness spending are
better, Gawande said.  Talwalkars, which offers fitness, aerobics and yoga classes,
last week reported net income doubled to 58.9 million rupees in
the quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier.  Annual  per capita income  in Asia’s third-largest economy
rose to 33,588 rupees as of March 31 from 15,881 rupees ten
years ago, according to government data.  Funds run by HSBC Asset Management India Pvt. own 2.5
percent of Talwalkars, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
