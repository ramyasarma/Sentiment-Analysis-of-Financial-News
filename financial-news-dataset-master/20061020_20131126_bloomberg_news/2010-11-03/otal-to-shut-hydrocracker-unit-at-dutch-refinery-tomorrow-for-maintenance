Total SA , Europe’s biggest oil
refiner, will shut a hydrocracker complex at its  Vlissingen 
refinery in the Netherlands tomorrow for maintenance and
inspections, according to the refinery’s  website .  The shutdown process will last until Nov. 8, after which
work can begin. The unit, which mainly produces diesel, is
scheduled to be in operation from Nov. 20 and the start will
take “several days,” according to the statement.  The 190,000 barrel-a-day refinery, a venture with Russia’s
OAO Lukoil, had a full halt in May last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The hydrocracker can process 48,000
barrels a day, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
