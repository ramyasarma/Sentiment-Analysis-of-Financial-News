Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, said profit rose 15 percent on
gains tied to a rising stock market.  Third-quarter  net income  climbed to $1.24 billion, or $2.46
a share, from $1.08 billion, or $2.35, in the year-earlier
period, the Newark, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding the results of policies sold before the
company went public and some investments, profit was $2.12 a
share, beating the $1.44 average  estimate  of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld  is expanding abroad
after claiming the top spot for Prudential among U.S. sellers of
variable annuities last year. The equity-linked retirement
products helped boost profit as stock markets rebounded from the
financial crisis. In September, Prudential agreed to buy two
Japanese units from American International Group Inc. for $4.8
billion.  “They’ve taken a lot of share from weaker competitors, in
variable annuities especially,”  Drew Woodbury , an analyst with
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said before the earnings
announcement. In the future, “the main thing is the acquisition
in Asia.”  Prudential rose $1.14, or 2.2 percent, to $54.11 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has advanced 8.7 percent this year.  Annuities Gain  Prudential recorded a $412 million gain in its annuities
business as the rising stock market allowed the company to lower
reserves against minimum-return guarantees it makes to
customers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 11 percent in
the three months ended Sept. 30.  The gain helped boost operating profit 87 percent at
Prudential’s individual annuities business to $588 million.
Gross sales at the business fell about 8.5 percent to $5.4
billion, the company said.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$67.81 a share for the main business, from $59.94 on June 30.
Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity holdings at the main
portfolio climbed to $9.6 billion on Sept. 30 from $5.8 billion
on June 30.  Prudential is extending its rivalry with New York-based
MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, as the two firms
expand outside the U.S. MetLife completed the $16.2 billion
acquisition of AIG’s American Life Insurance Co. this week,
giving the firm more clients from Russia to Chile and a business
in Japan that Chief Financial Officer  William Wheeler  called “a
cash machine.”  Scaled-Back Equity Offering  Strangfeld will issue less debt and equity for the AIG deal
than previously planned, and more cash, the company said in a
regulatory filing today. The insurer now plans to sell about $1
billion in stock and $1 billion in bonds, compared with a prior
projection of $2.5 billion in securities.  Prudential returned to  profit  last year with $3.12 billion
of net income, compared with a net loss of $1.12 billion in
2008. The company and  MetLife  have taken market share as bailed-
out rivals including Hartford Financial Services Group  Inc.  and
New York-based AIG scaled back to conserve funds.  Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market,
contributes more than a fifth of Prudential’s revenue. Excluding
items such as some investment results, operating profit in the
country was $1.6 billion last year, Prudential has  said . The AIG
deal is Strangfeld’s second purchase in Japan since  taking over 
as CEO in 2008.  Japan Sales  Japan accounted for about 17 percent of the world’s life
insurance sales last year, according to a  study  by Swiss
Reinsurance Co. Premium volume was $399 billion in 2009, down
0.8 percent when adjusted for inflation, Swiss Re said. In the
U.S., the world’s biggest market, premiums dropped 15 percent to
$492 billion, according to the Zurich-based reinsurer.  Prudential’s premiums, policy charges and fee income from
Gibraltar and other Japanese operations rose 21 percent to  $6.99
billion  last year. Prudential posted total 2009 revenue of
 $32.69 billion .  To contact the reporter on this story:
