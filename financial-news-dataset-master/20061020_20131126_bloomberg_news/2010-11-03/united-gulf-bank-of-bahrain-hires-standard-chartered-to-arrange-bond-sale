United Gulf Bank BSC  hired  Standard
Chartered Bank Plc  as the lead arranger for a possible bond
sale, according to the chief financial officer of  Kuwait
Projects Co ., which controls the Bahrain-based firm.  Kuwait Projects, Kuwait’s biggest privately-owned
investment company known as Kipco, is also considering a
domestic bond issue of about 40 million dinars ($143 million) to
refinance maturing debt, Pinak Maitra said at a conference in
Dubai today. Kipco’s 40 million-dinar nine-year bond matures
Nov. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our intention is to pay off this bond as it matures, ,"
Maitra said. "Investors are approaching us. We are considering
all options."  Bond sales in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council  rose
to $9.7 billion in the third quarter from $5.4 billion in the
previous quarter, as investor confidence improved with progress
on state-owned Dubai World’s restructuring deal. Kipco sold $500
million of 10-year debt, in July.  Kipco holds 91 percent of United Gulf Bank, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
