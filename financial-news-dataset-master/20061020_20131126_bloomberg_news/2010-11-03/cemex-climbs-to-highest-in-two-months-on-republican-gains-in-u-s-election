Cemex SAB , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, climbed to the highest level in two months on
speculation that Republican party gains in U.S. elections
yesterday bode well for the economy.  Cemex gained 3.9 percent to 11.14 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 12:52 p.m. New York time. Earlier today, the shares
advanced as much as 5.7 percent to 11.33 pesos, the highest
level since Sept. 7.  Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives
in yesterday’s elections as they added at least 60 seats, the
party’s biggest increase in power in the chamber since 1938.
Cemex is among the Mexican companies that are most exposed to
the U.S. economy, and investors are betting that the new
political dynamic will stoke growth, said  Carlos Hermosillo , an
analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte in Mexico City.  “It’s the optimism after the elections,” Hermosillo said
in a telephone interview. “The recovery that everyone is
waiting for depends entirely on the U.S.”  Cemex has climbed 10 percent since Oct. 25, the day before
the company announced it had amended a financial agreement with
banks to take into account lower-than-expected earnings. Cemex
last year reached a financial agreement with banks to refinance
$15 billion of debt to avoid default.  The company posted a posted a fourth straight quarter of
losses in the three months that ended Sept. 30.  Mexico’s benchmark IPC  index  rose 0.3 percent to 35,815.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
