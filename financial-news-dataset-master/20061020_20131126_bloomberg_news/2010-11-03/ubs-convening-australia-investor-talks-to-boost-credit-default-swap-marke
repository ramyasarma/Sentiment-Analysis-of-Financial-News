A group of Australian investors will
meet tomorrow to discuss ways to increase liquidity in the
nation’s credit-default swaps market, according  UBS AG , which is
hosting the talks.  Fund managers plan to gather in Sydney to consider whether
about 20 companies should be added to the  Markit iTraxx
Australia index  and to review the rules governing inclusion in
the benchmark,  Luke Fay , head of credit trading for UBS’s
Australian branch, said in a telephone interview today.  “Having more names in the index will help diversify risk
and will be more representative of the Australian credit
spectrum,” Fay said. “We think it will create more liquidity
moving forward.”  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Foster’s Group Ltd. and Tabcorp Holdings
Ltd. are among 25 companies whose swaps are in the Australian
iTraxx index, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness. New versions
of the index are created every six months to replace contracts
that cease to be actively-traded or that are written on
companies that no longer have investment-grade credit ratings.  UBS plans to present recommendations from tomorrow’s
informal talks to index owner Markit Group Ltd., according to
Fay. Officials at London-based Markit’s Sydney and Singapore
offices said they weren’t immediately able to comment.  Credit-default swap contracts pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or cash equivalent if a
borrower fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
