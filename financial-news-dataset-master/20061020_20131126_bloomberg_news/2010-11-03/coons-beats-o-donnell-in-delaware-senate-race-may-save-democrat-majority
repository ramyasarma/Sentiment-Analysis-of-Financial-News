Democrat  Chris Coons  won election to
the U.S. Senate from Delaware, defeating Republican  Christine O’Donnell  in a race that may keep Republicans from claiming
control of the chamber, according to a projection by the
Associated Press.  New Castle County Executive Coons, 47, won the seat
previously held by Vice President  Joe Biden  after O’Donnell, 41,
managed a surprise upset in the Republican primary over
Representative  Michael Castle . Political analysts had predicted
Castle would beat Coons in the general election.  O’Donnell, a marketing and media consultant, won the
nomination based on a surge of support from Tea Party activists
critical of federal government power. Her candidacy soon bogged
down as video clips of comments she made in the past on talk
shows, including one in which she said she dabbled in
witchcraft, captured national attention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
