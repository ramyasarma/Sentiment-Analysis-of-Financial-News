party is poised to win 79 percent of the seats in the country’s
legislature in elections that were held on Oct. 31, the  Daily
News  reported, citing the CCM’s campaign manager.  The party, led by President  Jakaya Kikwete , probably won
188 of the 239 elected seats in parliament, the state-run, Dar
es Salaam-based newspaper said, citing Abdulrahman Kinana.  The National Electoral Commission of Tanzania is the only
body with the legal power to announce official results for the
local, parliamentary and presidential elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
