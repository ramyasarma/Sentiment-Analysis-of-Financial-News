U.S. Representative Ed Royce, a
California Republican, said he will seek the chairmanship of the
House Financial Services Committee as his party takes control of
the chamber.  “I’m running for chairman of the Financial Services
Committee,” Royce said today in a telephone interview,
indicating he plans to mount a campaign against Representative
Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the panel’s ranking Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
