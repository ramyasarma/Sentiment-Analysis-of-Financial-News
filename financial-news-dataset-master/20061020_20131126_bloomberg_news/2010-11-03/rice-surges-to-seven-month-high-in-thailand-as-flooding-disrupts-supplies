Thai rice prices, the benchmark for
Asia, advanced 3.6 percent to a seven-month high after flooding
disrupted supplies, according to the  Thai Rice Exporters
Association .  The  price  of 100 percent grade-B white rice rose to $521 a
metric ton from $503 the previous week, said Pisanu Sangyoo, an
official at the association. That’s the highest level since
March 31, according to Bloomberg data. The price of  25 percent
broken rice  increased to $470 a ton from $462, Pisanu said.  Flooding has hit 48 of Thailand’s 77 provinces, the
 Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation  said today.
Main-crop rice output in Thailand, the world’s biggest exporter,
may fall by at least 1.5 million tons from last year’s 23
million tons after the floods,  Prasert Gosalvitra , head of the
Rice Department, said Oct. 26.  “Supply in the market is quite low as floods have
disrupted logistics at a time when exporters have purchasing
orders,” Pisanu said by phone. The exporters’ association holds
a meeting every week to set prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
