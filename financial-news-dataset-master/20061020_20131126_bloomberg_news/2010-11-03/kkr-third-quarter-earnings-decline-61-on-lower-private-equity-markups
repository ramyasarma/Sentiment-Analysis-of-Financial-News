KKR & Co., the buyout firm run by
 Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , said third-quarter profit fell
61 percent as it booked smaller gains on its private-equity
investments.  Economic net income, a measure of profit that excludes some
costs, decreased to $317.3 million from $822.7 million a year
earlier, New York-based KKR said in a statement today. Fee-
related earnings climbed 3.7 percent to $69.5 million.  Private-equity firms are seeking to revive deal-making as
borrowing costs near a three-year low make buyouts more
attractive and the financial market recovery allows them to exit
investments. KKR is in talks to take over Australian asset
manager  Perpetual Ltd.  for A$1.75 billion ($1.74 billion).
Unlike larger rival Blackstone Group LP, KKR hasn’t raised a new
buyout fund since the financial crisis.  “Everybody’s expecting them to come to market with a new
fund,” said  Michael Kim , an analyst at Sandler O’Neill &
Partners in New York, who rates the shares “buy.”  KKR raised $700 million for its China growth equity fund,
the company said today on a conference call with analysts. The
firm also raised $1.6 billion for infrastructure deals. KKR’s
private-equity portfolio is up 20 percent this year.  Higher Distribution  KKR shares  fell  14 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $12.51 at
12:29 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The firm had $12.5 billion in uncalled capital commitments
to funds in its private-markets business as of the end
September. Assets under management increased to $55.5 billion at
the end of the quarter from $50.4 billion a year earlier.  The company declared a quarterly distribution to
shareholders of 15 cents, from 8 cents last quarter.  Blackstone Group LP , the world’s largest buyout firm, said
last week that third-quarter profit increased 23 percent as the
value of its private-equity and real estate holdings rose.
Blackstone this year raised $13.5 billion for its sixth buyout
fund.  Private-equity firms pool investors’ money to take over
companies, financing the purchase with mostly debt, with the
intention of selling them later for a profit.  Buyout firms raised $59 billion in 83 new funds during the
third quarter, the same amount gathered a year earlier,
according to Preqin Ltd. Fundraising reached a high of $207
billion in the second quarter of 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
