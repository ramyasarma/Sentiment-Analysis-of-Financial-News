A half-percentage point increase in
Poland’s main interest rate to 4 percent “may be enough to 
stabilize inflation expectations,” central bank policy maker  Anna Zielinska-Glebocka  told  TVN CNBC  today.  It’s “difficult” to say when a rate increase may happen,
she said, adding that policy makers should consider raising
borrowing costs after the  Finance Ministry  yesterday said that
 inflation  probably accelerated to 2.9 percent in October, the
fastest pace in eight-months, she said.  “Our goal is to keep the inflation rate as near” the 2.5
percent target “as possible and if the rising trend continues,
it should be considered whether a reaction with an interest rate
increase is needed,” Zielinska-Glebocka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
