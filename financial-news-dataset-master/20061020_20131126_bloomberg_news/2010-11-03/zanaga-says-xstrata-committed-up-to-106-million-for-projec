Xstrata Plc , the world’s largest
exporter of thermal coal, agreed to pay as much as $106 million
to fund a pre-feasibility study of the Zanaga iron ore project
in the Republic of Congo.  Once the study is finished in the first quarter of 2011,
Xstrata will have 45 days to decide whether to exercise an
option to buy 50 percent plus one share in the project, operator
Zanaga Iron Ore Co. said in a statement today. Xstrata confirmed
the contents of the release and declined to comment further.  To exercise the option, Xstrata must fund a bankable
feasibility study at a cost of at least $100 million, Zanaga
said. Xstrata can then opt to buy the rest of the project once
the study is complete, it said, without giving further details.  Xstrata, which today raised its cash offer for iron ore
developer Sphere Minerals Ltd. by 20 percent to A$514 million
($513 million), is seeking to improve its access to supplies of
the raw material as prices climb.  The average spot price for ore delivered to China, the
world’s biggest buyer, was $145 a metric ton in the first half,
according to The Steel Index. That’s more than double the
average $69 a ton for the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
