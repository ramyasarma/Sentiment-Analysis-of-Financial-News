China’s stocks fell for a second day
after government officials said they would take further steps to
control inflation after raising interest rates last month.  The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.3 percent to
3,036.44 at 9:39 a.m. local time. A gauge of developers slid 0.8
percent for the biggest drop among the industry groups after the
central bank said it will step up use of price tools to manage
inflation expectations and Citic Securities said a property tax
would spur a 20 percent drop in housing prices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
