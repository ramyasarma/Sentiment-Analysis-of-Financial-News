European stocks  declined for the
first time in five days as investors awaited the outcome of
today’s Federal Reserve meeting to see whether it plans to pump
more money into the economy.  Statoil ASA sank 5.4 percent after Norway’s biggest oil and
gas company cut its production  forecast .  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV

two-day meeting after the close of European trading today and
will likely pledge to purchase $500 billion or more in
securities to support growth, according to 29 of 56 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The market’s expectations on the outcome of the Fed
meeting are very high and we’re in a tense situation at the
moment,” said  Jens Finkbeiner , who oversees about $210 million
at F+M Financial GmbH in Frankfurt. “We should see a clear
trend after the meeting but the question is of course: in which
direction? I do not exclude the possibility of a correction as
the market has been rising sharply.”  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 6.1 percent since Aug. 27, when

all that it can” to keep the economic recovery on track.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes declined in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2 percent.

manufacturing businesses , which covers about 90 percent of the
American economy, rose to 54.3 in October from 53.2 a month
earlier, the group said today. Other releases showed U.S.
factory orders and company payrolls climbed more than forecast.  The data followed yesterday’s U.S. midterm elections, in
which the Republicans took control of the House while falling
short of winning a majority in the Senate.  Statoil Slips  Statoil slid 5.4 percent to 122.4 kroner after cutting its

missing analysts’ estimates for adjusted profit.  AB InBev retreated 3.2 percent to 43.45 euros, the biggest

quarter profit growth that missed analysts’ estimates because of
increased spending on advertising and the cost of expansion in
emerging markets.  Bwin plunged 7.1 percent to 30.08 euros and PartyGaming

companies that are in the process of merging were cut to

from German and Greek regulation.”  Logica, Next  Logica Plc declined 3.2 percent to 129 pence, leading a

retailers lower. The U.K.’s second-biggest clothing retailer

second-largest health-care company said nine-month sales fell to
8.56 billion kronor ($1.3 billion) from 9.92 billion kronor the
same period last year.  Spanish Stocks Slide  Spain’s  IBEX 35  sank the most in six weeks as Banco
Santander SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA retreated.  BBVA, which yesterday said it will hold a 5.06 billion-euro
($7 billion) rights offer to help fund the purchase of a stake
