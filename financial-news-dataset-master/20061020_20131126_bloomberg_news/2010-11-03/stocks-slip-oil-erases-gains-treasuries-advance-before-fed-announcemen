U.S. stocks fell, with benchmark
indexes retreating from six-month highs, and oil erased gains
while Treasuries extended their advance as investors awaited the
Federal Reserve’s plans to stimulate the American economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which closed at the
highest level since May 3 yesterday, slipped 0.4 percent to
1,188.4 at 12:04 p.m. in New York. Oil was little changed after
rallying above $85 a barrel earlier. The yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.88 percent. The Dollar Index increased 0.2 percent.  The S&P 500 has rallied 14 percent and the dollar has
slumped at least 3.5 percent against 16 peers since Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke indicated in August that he may inject more cash
into the world’s largest economy. The Fed today may pledge to
purchase $500 billion or more in securities, 29 of 56 economists
in a Bloomberg survey said. Stocks also climbed amid speculation
that yesterday’s election would produce a divided U.S. Congress
that won’t pass further business reforms.                “It’s a buy on the rumor sell on the news situation,” said 
Michael Nasto, senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which
manages about $2.5 billion in San Antonio. “The election
results had been highly anticipated. Nobody knows what the Fed
will be announcing. Commodities’ prices are sinking and that’s
taking the market lower.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
