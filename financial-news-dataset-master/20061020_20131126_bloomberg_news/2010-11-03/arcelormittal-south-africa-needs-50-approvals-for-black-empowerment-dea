ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. , a
unit of the world’s largest steelmaker, said it needs 50 percent
plus one vote to secure approval for its planned 9.1 billion
rand ($1.3 billion) black economic empowerment deal.  The sale of a 26 percent stake to black investors isn’t a
related-party transaction, Communications Manager  Themba Hlengani  and Investor Relations Manager  Hennie Vermeulen  said in
the transcript of an interview published in the Johannesburg-
based  Business Report  newspaper today. As such, the deal doesn’t
need approval from 75 percent of shareholders, they said.  The planned transaction faces opposition from minority
shareholders who question the sale of a stake to a group known
as the Ayigobi Consortium, which includes Duduzane Zuma, son of
President  Jacob Zuma .  Five of the steelmaker’s biggest minority shareholders,
including Public Investment Corp., Africa’s largest pension fund
manager, and Sanlam Ltd., have said they’ll oppose the deal
because of concerns about corporate governance. PIC, which
manages government pensions, “questions the ethics” of the
proposal and won’t support it until “perceived irregularities”
are resolved, it said on Oct. 4.  ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg, has a controlling stake
in the South African unit.  ArcelorMittal South Africa rose 20 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to 80.20 rand by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, paring their
decline since the start of the year to 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
