Clyde King, who spent the past
34 years with the New York Yankees’ organization in a
variety of roles from general manager to scout, died
yesterday at a hospital in North Carolina. He was 86.  King joined the Yankees in 1976 and had a brief stint
as manager in 1982, when he went 29-33 over the final 62
games of the Major League Baseball season.  King was the team’s general manager from 1984-86 and
spent the past 21 years in scouting and advisory roles,
often reporting directly to principal owner George Steinbrenner , who died on July 13.  “Clyde was a loyal and dedicated friend and adviser
to my father, our family and the Yankees organization,”
Managing General Partner  Hal Steinbrenner  said in a
statement.  King pitched seven seasons in the majors for the
Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, compiling a 32-25
record with a 4.14 earned run average. He managed the San
Francisco Giants in 1969-1970 and the Atlanta Braves in
1974-1975, compiling a 234-229 record overall as a manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
