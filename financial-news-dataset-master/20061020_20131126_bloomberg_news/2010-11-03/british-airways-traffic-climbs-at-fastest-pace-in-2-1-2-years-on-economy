British Airways Plc  accelerated at
the fastest pace in more than 2 1/2 years last month as business
bookings surged and demand for short-haul flights rebounded to
outstrip gains in the long-haul market.  Passenger travel rose 3.9 percent in October, British
Airways said today, the most since February 2008, led by an 8.4
percent jump in the U.K. and Europe. All regions showed growth
in traffic, or passengers carried multiplied by distance flown.  Europe’s third-biggest airline posted a first profit in two
years on Oct. 29, when it reported net income of 229 million
pounds ($369 million) for the second quarter ended Sept. 30 from
revenue that jumped 18 percent to 2.51 billion pounds.  Premium sales rose 4.6 percent in October, with coach-class
travel up 3.7 percent. Overall capacity increased 5.2 percent,
outstripping the traffic gain and reducing the load factor, a
measure of seat occupancy, 1 percentage point to 79.8 percent.  British Airways was trading little changed at 272.4 pence
as of 2:44 p.m. in London. The stock is up 46 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
