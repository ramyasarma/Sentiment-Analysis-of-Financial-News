Porto Seguro SA , Brazil’s biggest
insurance company by market value, rose to a record in Sao Paulo
trading after reporting profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares gained 3.5 percent to 26.80 reais at the 4 p.m.
New York time close. That’s the highest closing price since the
company’s November 2004 initial public offering.  Porto Seguro reported third-quarter net income adjusted for
non-recurring items of 190 million reais ($112 million),
according to a regulatory filing today. That exceeded the
average forecast of 156 million reais among three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Porto Seguro reported very strong underwriting results,”
Banco BTG Pactual SA wrote in an e-mail to clients. “Investment
results came in strong, helping to boost the bottom line.”  BTG Pactual rates Porto Seguro “buy” and said it’s the
“top pick” in the industry. The stock has advanced 33 percent
this year and trades at 14.4 times reported earnings, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, the same ratio for the the
benchmark  Bovespa  index, which has increased 4.8 percent in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
