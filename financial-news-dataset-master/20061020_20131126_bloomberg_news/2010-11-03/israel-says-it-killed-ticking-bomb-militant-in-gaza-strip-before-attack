Israel’s military said it killed a
Palestinian militant in the Gaza Strip who was planning attacks
in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula on Israeli and U.S. targets.  “Earlier today, the Israeli army targeted a ticking
bomb,” the army spokeswoman, Lieutenant Colonel  Avital Leibovitz , told reporters in a conference call.  The man, identified by the army as Mohammed Namnam, was
killed in a bomb attack to stop him from carrying out his plans,
Leibovitz said without providing details of the device that was
used. It was the second targeted killing by the Israeli military
in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip in a month, the army said.  Leibovitz said the group that Namnam was a member of, the
Army of Islam, is loosely affiliated with al-Qaeda.  In Gaza, Adham Abu Selmeya, chief of medical services in
the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, told reporters that one man
was killed and three were wounded in an explosion today in a
police car in Gaza City.  Hamas, an Islamic group considered a terrorist organization
by the U.S., European Union and Israel, seized control of Gaza
in 2007, ending a partnership government with Palestinian
Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah party after winning
parliamentary elections the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
