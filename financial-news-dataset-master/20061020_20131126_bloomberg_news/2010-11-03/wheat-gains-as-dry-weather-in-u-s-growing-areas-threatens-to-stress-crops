Wheat futures rose in Chicago as dry
weather in the U.S. growing regions that has hurt crop ratings
threatens to reduce production potential in the world’s largest
exporter of the grain.  Dry weather continues to stress winter-wheat development in
the central and southern Plains, Telvent DTN Inc. said today.
Rain is becoming more likely in the next six to 10 days, though
less so in the west of the region, the forecaster said.  Wheat for December delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to $6.99 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$6.9775 at 12:15 p.m. Paris time. Milling wheat for January
delivery traded in the French capital climbed 0.3 percent to 219
euros ($307.67) a metric ton.  “Global crop weather always remains an important driver of
the agricultural commodity complex,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said by phone from
Sydney today.  About 46 percent of U.S.  winter wheat  was in good or
excellent condition as of Oct. 31, down from 47 percent the
previous week and 64 percent a year earlier, the USDA said on
Nov. 1. About 92 percent of the crop was planted in 18 states,
compared with 88 percent a week earlier and 81 percent a year
ago, the USDA said.  “This is the third-lowest rating in 25 years of USDA
record-keeping,”  Gail Martell , the founder of Martell Crop
Projections, said in a report yesterday. “For the time being,
the forecast remains dry in the U.S. breadbasket.”  Corn Advances  Comparable crop conditions in 1991-1992 and 2000-2001
“ended very differently, in the first case turning out a decent
but not spectacular yield, while the latter case finished with
historical low production,” Martell said. “Wheat potential
after a fall drought is directly linked to the amount of
precipitation received in winter.”  Corn futures advanced for the first time this week on
speculation the USDA may cut its estimate for U.S. production,
limiting supplies available to importers.  December-delivery corn added as much as 0.6 percent to
$5.79 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $5.785 a bushel.  The corn crop in the U.S., the world’s biggest, may fall to
12.592 billion bushels this year, less than the government’s
October forecast of 12.664 billion, agricultural researcher
Informa Economics Inc. said yesterday.  The Memphis, Tennessee-based agricultural researcher’s
estimate compares with FCStone Group Inc.’s forecast of 12.523
billion bushels. U.S. farmers reaped a record 13.11 billion
bushels of corn last year.  Soybeans Gain  One of the things “the grain market is looking at is the
USDA report to be released Tuesday,” Mathews said, referring to
the agency’s latest estimates on the U.S. harvest and global
supply and demand of agricultural commodities.  January-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$12.41 a bushel, before trading at $12.38 a bushel.  The U.S. soybean crop will reach 3.449 billion bushels,
FCStone said. The USDA last month predicted 3.408 billion
bushels, up from last year’s record 3.359 billion bushels.  Argentina may have rains this weekend, boosting soil
moisture for early-planted corn and soybeans, DTN said.
Argentina is the third-largest soybean grower and exporter,
after the U.S. and Brazil, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
