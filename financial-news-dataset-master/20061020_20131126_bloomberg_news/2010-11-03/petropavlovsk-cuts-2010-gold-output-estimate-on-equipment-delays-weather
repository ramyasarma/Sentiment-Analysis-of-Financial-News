Petropavlovsk Plc , Russia’s third-
largest gold producer, cut its 2010 estimate for output of the
metal on delayed equipment deliveries and “harsh” weather.  The company will produce 510,000 ounces to 530,000 ounces,
London-based Petropavlovsk said in a statement today. The
figures are less than analysts estimated in October, when they
cut their outlooks following a site visit. Collins Stewart Plc
forecast output of 590,000 ounces, UBS AG predicted 630,000
ounces and Numis Securities Ltd. 614,000 ounces.  “We continued to believe that we could overcome these
difficulties in time to meet our production expectations but are
now aware that this is no longer feasible because not enough
contingency was built into our plans for the year,”
Petropavlovsk said in the statement.  Equipment delays and cold weather cut output in the first
nine months by 12 percent to 304,600 ounces from a year earlier.
The company said on Oct. 7 that it was “striving” to hit its
full-year guidance, and in August said it may miss its 670,000-
ounce to 760,000-ounce annual target by as much as 5 percent.  “Our revised forecast production for 2010 is far short of
the number that we originally predicted and, indeed, the reduced
number we estimated as recently as August,” it said today.  Petropavlovsk produced 138,300 ounces in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
