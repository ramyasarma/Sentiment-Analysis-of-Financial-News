Eskom Holdings Ltd., which supplies
about 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity, agreed a 15
billion rand ($2.2 billion) loan with the Development Bank of
Southern Africa to fund an expansion of generating capacity.  “The approved debt finance will be disbursed over a five
year period,” the lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
The South African utility will sign the agreement at a ceremony
in Johannesburg tomorrow, the bank said.  Eskom is spending 485 billion-rand building plants to boost
electricity supply in Africa’s biggest economy and prevent a
repeat of outages that in early 2008 shut some of the nation’s
gold and platinum mines. The government has already given Eskom
a 60 billion-rand loan while the utility this year secured $3.75
billion from the World Bank to partly finance its Medupi plant.  The largest plants in Eskom’s expansion are the Medupi and
Kusile coal-fired power plants. The first unit of Medupi, the
most-advanced project, is scheduled to start generating power in
the fourth quarter of 2012, while a lack of funds means Kusile
is now expected to start production at the beginning of 2015,
compared with an earlier forecast of June 2013.  There won’t be any more blackouts in South Africa even
though construction of Kusile has been delayed, Eskom Chief
Executive Officer  Brian Dames  said in an interview with
Johannesburg’s 702 Talk Radio today.  “We will keep the lights on,” he said. “We won’t go back
to the days of load-shedding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
