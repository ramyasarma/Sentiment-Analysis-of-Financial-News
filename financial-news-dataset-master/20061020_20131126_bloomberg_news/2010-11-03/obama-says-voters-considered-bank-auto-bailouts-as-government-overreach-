President Barack Obama said many
voters viewed the bailouts of banks and automakers and the
economic stimulus as an “overreach” by government rather than
an emergency response to a crisis, adding to public concern
about his agenda.  The measures taken in response to the recession and
financial crisis came “fast and furious” and to voters, “it
felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into
people’s lives,” Obama said at a White House news conference a
day after Republicans won a majority of seats in the U.S. House
and narrowed the Democratic margin in the Senate.   “That’s something I think everybody in the White House
understood was a danger,” he said. “Even though these steps
were emergency situations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
