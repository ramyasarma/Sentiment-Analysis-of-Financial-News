Brazil’s real gained after the
Federal Reserve announced it will buy an additional $600 billion
of Treasuries.  The real advanced 0.8 percent to 1.6898 per dollar at 4
p.m. New York time, from 1.7030 on Nov 1. The real didn’t trade
yesterday as the country celebrated a national holiday.  Fifty-three of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
last week predicted the Fed would announce asset purchases
today, with 29 forecasting a pledge to buy $500 billion or more.
Today’s action has been dubbed “QE2” by investors for the
second round of a policy known as quantitative easing.  “The market was expecting something around $500 billion
and it came in slightly higher,” said  Huang Kuo Seen , a
portfolio manager at Grau Gestao De Ativos in Sao Paulo. “When
you do quantitative easing you’re debasing your currency
compared to the others.”  Fifteen of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
including the real, gained against the dollar. Only the Japanese
yen weakened.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 gained 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
11.33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
