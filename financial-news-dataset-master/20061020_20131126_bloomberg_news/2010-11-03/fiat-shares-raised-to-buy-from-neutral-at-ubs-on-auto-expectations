Fiat SpA was upgraded to “buy” from
“neutral” at UBS AG, which said in a note that “the market
may be underestimating the value in Fiat SpA post de-merger.”  The brokerage expects the auto business to surprise
“cyclically, with excess cash generation from working capital
when the macro cycle turns.” UBS also noted that Fiat is
“addressing two major loss centres, Alfa-Romeo and the Italian
plant network,” and called the deal with Chrysler Group LLC
“only one insufficient step towards scale and market
diversification.”  UBS lifted its price estimate on Fiat to 17 euros from 10.5
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
