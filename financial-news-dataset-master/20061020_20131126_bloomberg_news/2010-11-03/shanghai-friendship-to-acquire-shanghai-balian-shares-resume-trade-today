Shanghai Friendship Group Inc.  agreed
to buy rival department store chain Shanghai Bailian Group Co.
for about 16 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in a stock swap, as the
city government pushes state-owned companies to merge.  Friendship , which owns 34 percent of  Hong Kong-listed
Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Ltd. , will offer 0.86 share for
each one in Shanghai Bailian, the companies said in statements
to the Shanghai stock exchange today. Friendship also plans to
pay another 4.7 billion yuan worth of shares to buy a stake in
closely held Nextage Department Store and boost its Lianhua
holding to 55 percent.  “The transaction will boost  earnings  at Shanghai
Friendship, which will probably become the key retailer in the
Shanghai area, the key market in the country,”  Yao Wenqi , a
Shenzhen-based analyst at Great Wall Securities Co., said in a
phone interview today.  Shanghai’s government is merging companies to improve
competitiveness. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. completed
a merger of two local drugmakers through a share swap in
September. Shanghai Airlines Co. was delisted from the exchange
in January after it was acquired by larger city rival China
Eastern Airlines Corp.  Friendship’s  shares  rose by the 10 percent daily limit to
18.57 yuan on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the biggest advance
since January 15, 2007.  Bailian  rose 9.1 percent to 15.05 yuan,
the biggest gain since Dec. 1, 2008. The shares of both
companies resumed trading today after a July 19 suspension.  Lianhua was suspended today in Hong Kong trading.  Pretax Profit  The value of the deal was derived using a stock price of
16.88 yuan, the level at which  Friendship  closed on July 16,
before it was suspended.  Friendship’s pretax profit may more than double to 1.98
billion yuan this year and 2.02 billion yuan next year after the
acquisition, according to a separate e-mailed statement from
Bailian today. Sales may reach 43.7 billion yuan and 46.6
billion yuan in the two years.  Friendship will buy from Bailian’s parent an investment
company that holds 21 percent of Lianhua, the statements said.  Bailian’s parent will increase its holding in Friendship to
49.26 percent after the swap from 27.3 percent, the statements
said. The stake may increase to 57.71 percent if shareholders
take cash, the said.  -- Jiang Jianguo ,  Jing Jin . Editor:  Gregory Turk , Frank Longid  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
