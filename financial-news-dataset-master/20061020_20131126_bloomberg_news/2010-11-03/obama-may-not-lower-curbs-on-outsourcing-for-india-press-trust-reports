President  Barack Obama  may not
accommodate India’s concerns on his policy of discouraging
outsourcing of American jobs, the Press Trust of India said,
citing an interview with Obama.  “I have a responsibility to support jobs and opportunity
for the American people,” Obama told the news agency. The
administration is “focused on America’s economic recovery,
investing in America’s future, creating and keeping jobs in the
United States, increasing our exports and providing incentives
and creating conditions under which businesses can grow and
prosper.”  Export of dual-use technology and India’s bid for a
permanent seat at the United Nations’ Security Council were
“very difficult and complicated” issues, Obama told Press
Trust.  Obama also said Pakistan needed to “transparently, fully
and urgently” punish the people responsible for the 2008 Mumbai
terrorist attacks, Press Trust said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
