Companies in the U.S. boosted
payrolls by more than forecast in October, data from a private
report showed today.  Employment increased by 43,000 after a revised 2,000 drop
in September, according to figures from ADP Employer Services.
The median estimate of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 20,000 gain. Forecasts ranged from a decline of
10,000 to a 50,000 increase.  A Labor Department report in two days will show companies
added 80,000 workers last month and the  unemployment rate  held
at 9.6 percent, according to the survey median. Concern that
growth is too slow to lower unemployment will probably prompt
Federal Reserve policy makers to take additional steps today to
spur the world’s largest economy.  “It does look like momentum is turning more positive,”
said  Jim O’Sullivan , global chief economist at MF Global Ltd. in
New York. “The data are consistent with private payrolls coming
in above consensus. Momentum is going to start turning positive
gain in the next couple of months.”  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figures were
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in May, when it overestimated the gain in jobs by
14,000. The estimate was least accurate in April, when it
underestimated the employment gain by 199,000.  September’s Outcome  ADP’s initial September estimate showed a 39,000 drop in
private employment compared with the government’s estimate of a
64,000 increase.  The Fed later today will probably introduce an
unprecedented second round of unconventional monetary easing by
announcing a plan to buy at least $500 billion of long-term
securities, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The measures are meant to bring down unemployment and keep the
economy growing.  Stocks and Treasuries rose before the Fed’s decision. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.1 percent to 1,195.18 at
9:34 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note,
which moves inversely to price, fell to 2.55 percent from 2.59
percent late yesterday.  Anxiety over jobs and the economy helped Republicans seize
control of the House of Representatives in elections yesterday,
delivering a rebuke to the domestic agenda of President Barack
Obama.  Today’s ADP report showed a decrease of 34,000 workers in
goods-producing industries including manufacturers and
construction companies. Service providers added 77,000 workers.  Employment in construction fell by 23,000, while factories
cut 12,000 jobs, ADP said.  Data Breakdown  Companies employing more than 499 workers reduced their
workforces by 2,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 24,000 jobs, and small companies
increased payrolls by 21,000, ADP said.  “Employment gains of this magnitude are not sufficient to
lower the unemployment rate,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, which produces the figures with ADP,
said in a statement. “Given modest growth in the second and
third quarters, and the usual lag of employment behind GDP, it
would not be surprising to see several more months of lethargic
employment gains, even if the economic recovery gathers
momentum.”  Overall payrolls probably rose by 60,000 in October,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed before
the Labor Department’s Nov. 5 report. The difference from the
projection for private employment reflects government job
reductions related to the winding down of decennial census and
state and local budget cuts.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers.  Job Cuts  Some companies are still cutting staff while others are
hiring.  United Technologies Corp. , the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet
engines and Carrier air conditioners, plans to cut about 3,300
jobs as part of cost-reduction efforts announced this year.  The Hartford, Connecticut-based company sliced 1,300
positions in the first nine months of this year and is targeting
the rest through 2011, it said in a quarterly filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week. At the end of
2009, the company had 206,700 workers.  General Electric Co . plans to spend $432 million and add
500 U.S. jobs to design and make energy-efficient refrigerators.
Factories and design centers will open in Indiana, Kentucky,
Alabama and Tennessee over the next four years, Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE said.  “When the economy comes back -- and it will come back at
some point -- we want to be in position with the right product
offering, the right cost structure to leverage the expansion,”
 Jim Campbell , head of the appliances and lighting division, said
in an interview on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
