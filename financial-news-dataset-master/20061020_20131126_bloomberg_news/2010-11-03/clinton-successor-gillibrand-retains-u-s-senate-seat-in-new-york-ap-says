Democrat  Kirsten Gillibrand , who
succeeded  Hillary Clinton  in the U.S. Senate from New York, was
re-elected, defeating former Representative  Joseph DioGuardi ,
the Associated Press projected.  Gillibrand , 43, had represented a congressional district
near the state capital of Albany when she was appointed in
January 2009 to succeed Clinton, who was named by President
 Barack Obama  as U.S. secretary of state. Several well-known
Democrats declined to challenge her in the primary and she
coasted to the nomination.  DioGuardi , 60, who served in the House from 1985 to 1989,
defeated fellow Republican  David Malpass  to win his party’s nod.
His daughter, Kara, a singer-songwriter, was a judge on the Fox
television network program  “American Idol.”   Gillibrand will fill out the remainder of Clinton’s term
and face the voters again in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
