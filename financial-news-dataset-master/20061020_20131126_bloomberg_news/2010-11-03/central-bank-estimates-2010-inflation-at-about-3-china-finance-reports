China’s consumer prices may grow at
about 3 percent this year, China Finance magazine reported,
citing a report from the People’s Bank of China’s financial
research institute.  Growth in consumer prices may slow in the fourth quarter,
the magazine reported, citing the report. The country may still
face inflation pressure next year because food prices,
agricultural products prices and imported inflation pressure
will increase, the magazine reported.  China’s economic growth in the fourth quarter will slow to
about 9 percent, the report said. Exports in the fourth quarter
may rise about 15 percent from a year earlier, according to the
report.  China’s producer prices may increase about 5 percent this
year, the report said. China Finance magazine is published by
the central bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
