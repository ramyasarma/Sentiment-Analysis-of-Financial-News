China, the world’s largest zinc
producer, will sell 50,000 metric tons of the metal from state
stockpiles, boosting domestic supplies as an energy-saving drive
curbs output and boosts prices.  China will auction the ingots from state reserves on Nov.
9, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a
statement. These reserves were bought from domestic smelters
between February and May last year, the  website  statement said.  The government has sold paper pulp, magnesium, sugar,
cotton and corn this year in an effort to ease supply shortages
and curb price gains. China, also the world’s largest aluminum
consumer, planned to sell 96,000 tons of aluminum ingots through
a public auction in the past two days.  “It will be the first public auction of zinc by the
government,”  Feng Juncong , an analyst at Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co., said by phone today, forecasting a
drop in prices. “It is probably to help offset reduced
production as China is limiting power supplies to smelters.”  China will also auction lead from state reserves in the
“near term,” Caixin Online  reported  today, citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the matter.  Zinc for February delivery gained as much as 2 percent to
20,310 yuan ($3,043) a ton today in Shanghai, and traded at
20,180 yuan by 1:38 p.m. local time. Futures have increased 28
percent since June 1.  State Buying  China bought 235,000 tons of copper, 590,000 tons of
aluminum, 159,000 tons of zinc, 30 tons of indium and 5,000 tons
of titanium for reserves, Caijing magazine reported in June last
year, citing Yu Dongming, a metals industry official of the
National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s
economic planner.  Chinese state buying of raw materials for stockpiling in
the first half of last year helped lift commodity prices, with
copper and zinc doubling in 2009.  China has started to control output at energy-intensive
plants in provinces including Henan, Hebei, Zhejiang and
Shandong to meet an energy-saving target. Henan, the nation’s
largest aluminum-producing region, may cut output by nearly 20
percent in the quarter ending Dec. 31, the Henan Nonferrous
Metals Industry Association said Oct. 9.  Zinc production in China may fall between 30,000 and 40,000
tons in November due to the power limits, Feng said. Still,
inventories of the metal are “very high,” she said.  China isn’t likely to sell copper from state reserves under
current circumstances, Zhu Bin, president of Nanhua Futures
Co.’s research department, said at a conference today.  “The State Reserve Bureau is more likely to sell when the
local cash premium is as high as 1,000-2,000 yuan a ton,” said
Zhu.  -- Helen Yuan , Huiwen Yang. Editors: Richard Dobson, Matthew
