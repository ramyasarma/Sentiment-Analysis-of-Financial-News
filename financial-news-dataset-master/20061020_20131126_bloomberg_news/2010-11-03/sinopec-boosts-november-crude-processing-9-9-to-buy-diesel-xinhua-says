China Petrochemical Corp.  plans to
increase its daily processing of crude oil in November by 9.9
percent to an average of 583,000 metric tons, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported, citing the company. It didn’t say
if the gain was month-on-month or year-on-year.  The refiner, known as the Sinopec Group, will also buy
200,000 tons of diesel from overseas to help ease a domestic
shortage of the fuel, Xinhua said, citing the company. Last
month, the company’s daily crude processing volume increased by
12.3 percent to a record, Xinhua said, without giving figures.  October was the fourth month the company operated at full
capacity, Xinhua said, citing Sinopec Group. The capacity
utilization rate rose 0.6 percentage point from the average
between January and September, the company was cited by Xinhua
as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
