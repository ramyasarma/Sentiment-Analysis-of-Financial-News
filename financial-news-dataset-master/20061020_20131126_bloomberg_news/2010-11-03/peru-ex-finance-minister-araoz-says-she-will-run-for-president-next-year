Peru’s former Finance Minister
 Mercedes Araoz  said she will run for president next year as a
candidate for President  Alan Garcia ’s Apra party.  “One must seek a balance between economic coherence and
public policies to make sure more people enjoy the benefits of
that growth,” Araoz said today in an  interview  on
Radioprogramas. “I’ve always been in the center, where one
doesn’t believe the market can solve everything and where
there’s proper state intervention.”  Araoz, 49, who holds a Master’s in economics from the
University of Miami, resigned in September after spending four
years in Garcia’s Cabinet, leading the trade and production
ministries. During her eight-month tenure as finance minister,
Araoz managed a $3 billion fiscal stimulus package that put
South America’s sixth-biggest  economy  on course to expand as
much as 8 percent this year, according to the central bank.  Standard & Poor’s  in August revised its outlook on Peru’s
foreign currency rating to positive from stable after Araoz sold
$334 million of sol-denominated February 2042 bonds to help
finance a $415 million buyback. S&P also affirmed Peru’s BBB-
long-term foreign currency and BBB+ long-term local currency
sovereign ratings.  Peru’s sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7934 per dollar at 12:12
p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
