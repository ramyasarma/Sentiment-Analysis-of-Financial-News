Pangaea Partners Ltd., a U.S.
investment banking group that specializes in emerging markets,
said it sold its stake in a Zambian stockbroker to Renaissance
Capital for an undisclosed sum.  “It was Renaissance that bought our stake,” Eric Postel,
the founder of Madison, Wisconsin-based  Pangaea , said in an e-
mail today. Pangaea Partners on Nov. 1 said it sold its stake in
Pangaea Renaissance Securities Ltd., which started trading in
Zambia in 1994, without disclosing the buyer.  Renaissance Capital, the Russian investment bank part-owned
by billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, operates in five African
nations and plans to move into Angola, Uganda and Rwanda with
the continent already accounting for a quarter of RenCap’s
investment-banking business.  Renaissance Capital first purchased a 49 percent stake in
Pangaea in Zambia in April 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
