U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  arrived in Papua New Guinea to highlight anti-corruption
measures and discuss the island nation’s plans to manage massive
fields of petroleum and natural gas.  During her five-hour stop in Port Moresby, Clinton will
also address the status of women in the violence-prone capitol
and climate change. Her visit is part of a two-week trip to the
region meant to bolster alliances and reaffirm U.S. leadership
in the Asia-Pacific region.  As part of that diplomatic effort, Clinton held her second
annual meeting with Pacific Island leaders on the margins of the
 United Nations General Assembly  meeting in September. The U.S.
also sent its largest delegation ever to the 16-country Pacific
Islands Forum meeting in August. Papua New Guinea’s natural
resources include gold, copper, oil and natural gas.  Clinton will visit a mangrove reforestation project, part
of U.S. support for efforts to manage biodiversity and climate
change. The Obama administration has pledged more than $21.5
million over the next two years, pending Congressional approval,
in climate change assistance for Pacific Island countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
