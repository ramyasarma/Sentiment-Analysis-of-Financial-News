Time Warner Inc. , owner of the Warner
Bros. film studio, is near agreements with television
distributors to make movies available on-demand for viewing at
home soon after they run in theaters.  Time Warner expects to start the so-called premium service
in the second quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bewkes  said
today on an earnings conference call. The company is close to
agreements on the pricing and timing after theatrical release.  Studios including Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co. are in
talks for the VOD service with In Demand, a partnership of Cox
Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc.,
 Bob Benya , head of In Demand, said in a September interview. The
service would cost as much as $30 per showing. Movies will be
available in high definition and eventually in 3-D, Bewkes said
today.  Hollywood studios are searching for ways to generate
additional movie revenue as DVD purchases decline. A premium
service would let consumers watch movies on TV sets without
waiting as long as the typical three to four months for DVDs or
cable companies’ on-demand showings that cost $4 or so.  In September, Time Warner CFO  John Martin  said Warner Bros.
expects to begin testing a premium video-on-demand window later
this year for $20 to $30 per viewing. Analysts including  Alan Gould  of Evercore Partners have suggested that “Harry Potter”
should be the first test film.  To contact the reporter on this story:
