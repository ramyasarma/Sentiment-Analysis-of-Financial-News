An overview of activity since markets
closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks advanced, with banks helping
benchmark indexes erase losses, after the Federal Reserve
announced an additional $600 billion of Treasury purchases
through June in a bid to boost growth in the world’s largest
economy.
*JPMorgan Chase & Co., Fifth Third Bancorp and Bank of America
Corp. advanced more than 1.2 percent to help lead gains among
lenders. Ford Motor Co. jumped 5 percent after sales rose 15
percent in October.
*The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 1,198.03 as of 3:16 p.m. in
New York. The measure had fallen as much as 0.8 percent.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 26.64 points, or 0.2
percent, to 11,215.36.  London: European stocks declined for the first time in five days
as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting
to see whether it plans to pump more money into the economy.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.4 percent to 266.51 at the
4:30 p.m. close of trading in London.  Tokyo: Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.5 percent to 4,722.60.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar touched a nine-month low versus the euro
after the Federal Reserve said it will pump more money into the
economy by boosting asset purchases to spur inflation and
employment, debasing the world’s reserve currency.
*The dollar was little changed at $1.4026 per euro at 2:32 p.m.
in New York, from $1.4034 yesterday. It touched $1.4179,
matching a low reached Jan. 26.
*The dollar rose 1 percent to 81.48 yen, from 80.63. The
Japanese currency dropped against all major currencies on
speculation the Fed’s plan will increase demand for higher
yielding assets.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasury 30-year bond fell the most in almost two
months after the Federal Reserve said it will buy fewer of the
securities than anticipated by investors in its $600 billion
program of purchases to boost the economy.
*Treasury 30-year yields touched the highest since Aug. 5 after
the Fed said in a statement at the end of a two-day Federal Open
Market Committee gathering, that it will make 4 percent of its
purchases in the 17- to 30 year sector.
*Thirty-year bond yields rose 15 basis points to yield 4.07
percent at 3:18 p.m. in New York, the biggest rise since Sept.
9.
*The yield on the 10-year note rose 4 basis point to 2.63
percent.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper prices fell for the first time in three days as
traders bet that better-than-expected U.S. jobs data would
weaken the case for additional stimulus money.

economists’ estimates, an ADP Employer Services report today
showed.

percent, to close at $3.785 a pound at 1:26 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. The metal traded at $3.7925 at 2:44 p.m. The price
climbed 2.8 percent in the previous two days.  GOLD  New York: Gold fell, extending earlier losses, after the Federal
Reserve said it plans to ease monetary policy further to avert
deflation.

through June and pledged to keep the benchmark interest close to
zero percent for an “extended period”.

or 2.3 percent, to $1,325.50 an ounce at 2:28 p.m. in electronic
trading on the Comex in New York following the announcement.  OIL  New York: Oil rose to the highest level in six months as a U.S.
