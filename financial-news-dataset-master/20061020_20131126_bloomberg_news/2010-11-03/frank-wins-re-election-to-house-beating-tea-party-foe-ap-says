U.S. House Financial Services
Committee Chairman  Barney Frank  of Massachusetts won a 16th
term, the Associated Press said, fending off a challenge from a
Tea Party-backed challenger.  Frank, 70, had faced one of his toughest re-election fights
against businessman Sean Bielat, 35, who seized on the
Massachusetts Democrat’s role in the 2008 Wall Street bailout
and this year’s overhaul of financial-industry regulations.  Frank had 61 percent of the vote to Bielat’s 36 percent
with 64 percent of precincts reporting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
