Aluminum Corp. of China , the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, is seeking to participate in the
Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia that’s being
developed by Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group.  “We are seeking to find the best time to participate in
the Oyu Tolgoi project,”  Zhao Zhengang , general manager of
overseas investment at the state-owned company that’s known as
Chinalco, said today in an interview in Beijing. “Mongolia is a
very important region as it is rich in mineral resources and the
region is a good fit with Chinalco’s plans to develop overseas”  Chinalco, the largest shareholder in  Rio Tinto , has stepped
up overseas acquisitions to diversify, buying copper assets in
Peru and an iron ore project in Guinea via its publicly traded
unit. London-based Rio says Oyu Tolgoi, due to start output in
2013, is the world’s largest untapped copper and gold deposit.  Chinalco’s President  Xiong Weiping  said in August that
Chinalco is studying acquisitions of “large and quality”
copper deposits with reserves of as much as 5 million metric
tons. The company bought Peru Copper Inc. in 2007 to develop the
$2.2 billion  Toromocho project  in central Peru.  -- Xiao Yu . Editors:  Andrew Hobbs ,  Keith Gosman   To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story: Xiao Yu in
