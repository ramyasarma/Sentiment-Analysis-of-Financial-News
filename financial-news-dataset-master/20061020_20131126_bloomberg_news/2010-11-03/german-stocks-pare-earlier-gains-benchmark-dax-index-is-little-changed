German stocks pared their gain as a
decline by E.ON AG and Deutsche Post AG offset a rally in shares
of HeidelbergCement AG.  The benchmark DAX Index was little changed at 6,656.4 at
2:40 p.m. in Frankfurt, after rising as much as 0.4 percent
earlier today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
