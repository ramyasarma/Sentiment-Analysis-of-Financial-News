The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds outside of Japan from non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 2 basis points to 103 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in Singapore, Barclays Plc prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
106.5 basis points as of 11:33 a.m. in Sydney, Nomura Holdings
Inc. prices show.  Markets in Japan were closed for a public holiday. The
Markit  iTraxx Japan index  closed at 103.4 basis points
yesterday, according to data provider CMA. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
