Yuan forwards gained for a fifth day
on speculation the central bank will permit appreciation after
data this week indicated growth is accelerating in the world’s
second-largest economy.  People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  pledged to
improve the yuan’s exchange-rate mechanism and allow the
currency to be gradually used in trade settlement and investment,
Radio Television Hong Kong reported today. The central bank
raised the reference rate 0.16 percent to 6.6818 against the
dollar, the biggest increase in almost three weeks.  “China’s economic fundamentals are supporting a stronger
currency,” said  Guan Jiaying , a currency analyst in Beijing at
China Citic Bank Co., a unit of China’s biggest state investment
company. “The recent data has ruled out the possibility of a
double-dip in the economy.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.22 percent
to 6.43 per dollar as of 5:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets
the currency will strengthen 3.7 percent from the spot rate of
6.6761, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.7 in October, the
fastest pace in six months, from 53.8 in September, China’s
logistics federation said on Nov. 1.  Total cross-border trade using the yuan jumped 160 percent
in the third quarter from the prior three months to 126.5
billion yuan ($19 billion), the central bank reported late
yesterday. The amount exceeded all but one of seven forecasts in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “As global companies and investors try to get hold of the
yuan, the appreciation expectation will definitely get
stronger,” said  Lu Zhengwei , an economist at Industrial Bank Co.
in Shanghai. “The accelerated yuan gains in offshore market
will have an impact on the onshore sentiment.”  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.3 percent
to 6.5895 per dollar.  -- Judy Chen ,  Andrea Wong . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Dirk Beveridge   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
