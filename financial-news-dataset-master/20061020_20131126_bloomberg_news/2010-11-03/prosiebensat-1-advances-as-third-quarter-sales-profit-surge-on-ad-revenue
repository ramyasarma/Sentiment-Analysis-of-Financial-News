ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG  gained as
much as 7.1 percent in Frankfurt trading as Germany’s biggest
private broadcaster reported better-than-estimated third-quarter
operating profit and sales on higher advertising revenue.  Profit before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortization rose 64 percent from a year earlier to 154.9
million euros ($217.7 million), the company said today. Revenue
gained 12 percent to 626.9 million euros. The average estimate
of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for profit of 139.6
million euros on sales of 624 million euros.  The broadcaster, which operates the ProSieben, Sat.1 and
Kabel 1 channels, is benefitting from rising ad sales as
companies increase marketing budgets in the wake of an improving
economy. Ad markets have rebounded faster than expected, ad-
buying agency ZenithOptimedia Group Ltd. said last month,
lifting its 2010 growth forecast for the third time this year.
Global ad expenditure this year will rise 4.8 percent, it said.  ProSiebenSat.1 reported “strong third-quarter results,”
Citigroup analysts  Thomas Singlehurst ,  Ruchi Malaiya  and
Catherine O’Neill said in a note. “The key driver of this beat
was German-speaking free-TV revenues which were up 14.8
percent.”  ProSiebenSat.1  rose as much  as 1.37 euros to 20.67 euros
and was up 6.1 percent at 20.48 euros as of 1:09 p.m. The
company has risen 154 percent this year, making it the best
performing stock in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Company Sale?  Private equity firms  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co . and
Permira LLP agreed to buy control of ProSiebenSat.1, based in
Unterfoehring near Munich, at the end of 2006. The following
year, they combined ProSiebenSat.1 with SBS, another company
they control and which runs TV stations and radio networks in
Scandinavia, Belgium, Netherlands and southeastern Europe.  KKR and Permira want to sell the broadcaster while the
advertising market is booming, Reuters reported yesterday,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. A sale
of ProSiebenSat.1 may prove difficult, making a public offering
more likely, Reuters said, adding that nothing has yet been
decided.  KKR and Permira agreed in December 2006 to buy a majority
stake in ProSiebenSat.1 for 3.1 billion euros from U.S.
billionaire  Haim Saban ’s German Media Partners LP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
