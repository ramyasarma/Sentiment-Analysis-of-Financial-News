The dollar may find support should
more than one Federal Reserve policy maker object to resuming
asset purchases at today’s Federal Open Market Committee
meeting, RBC Capital Markets said.  “More than one dissenter would be supportive of the
dollar,”  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist in Hong Kong,
wrote in a research note today.  Investors should also study the details of the decision,
because a suggestion there will be incremental increases that
are “data dependent” may also boost the U.S. currency, Trinh
said.  The dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.4002 as of 6:44
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
