FedEx Corp. , the second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company, said it will buy Indian delivery
businesses from AFL Pvt. as economic growth spurs cargo volumes
in the Asian nation.  FedEx Express will buy logistics, distribution and express
units in the deal, which is expected to be completed in the
fiscal quarter ending in February, FedEx said in a BusinessWire
statement today, without providing a value for the deal. The
Memphis, Tennessee-based company will also acquire AFL affiliate
Unifreight India Pvt.  The deal will give FedEx more than 160 service centers in
144 Indian cities, boosting its reach in Asia’s third-biggest
economy. The nation’s logistics market is expected to grow to
$120.4 billion in 2014 from $75.2 billion in 2009 as both
manufacturing and farm output increase, Frost & Sullivan said in
a report in January.  “The acquisition supports our long-term strategy to grow
our international business and better serve our customers
seeking to expand or enter the Indian market,”  Michael L. Ducker , chief operating officer of FedEx Express, said in the
statement. “This will provide customers with more service
options.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is advising FedEx on the deal, while
Evercore Partners and Ardashir Dubash are working with AFL,
according to the statement.  Mumbai-based AFL, founded in 1945, has a network that
covers more than 1,400 destinations in India and operates 50
warehouses with about 1 million square feet in storage space,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
