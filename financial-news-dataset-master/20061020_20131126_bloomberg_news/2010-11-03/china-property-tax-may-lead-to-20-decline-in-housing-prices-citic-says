The introduction of a property tax in
China may cause housing prices to drop between 15 percent and 20
percent, according to Citic Securities.  The tax may affect economic growth by 0.48 percentage
point to 0.64 percentage point by slowing down real-estate
investment, analysts led by Zhu Jianfang wrote in a note today.
The tax would bring 300 billion yuan of fiscal revenue for local
governments, they said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
