Yemen has boosted security at its
airports following the discovery of two bomb parcels destined
for the U.S. which originated in Yemen, Prime Minister Ali
Mujawar said.  Speaking to Yemen-based ambassadors from the European
Union, Mujawar said his country is under increased pressure from
militant activity and welcomed logistical support from its
allies, the state-run Saba agency reported late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
