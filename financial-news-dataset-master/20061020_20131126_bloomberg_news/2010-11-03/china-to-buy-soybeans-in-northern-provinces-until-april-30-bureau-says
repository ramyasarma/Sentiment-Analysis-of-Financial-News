China ’s central grain reserve will
buy soybeans this year in the top northern producing provinces
to boost incomes, the State Administration of Grain said.  The government will pay 3.80 yuan per kilogram ($570 per
metric ton) for the soybeans harvested this year in Heilongjiang,
Liaoning, Inner Mongolia and Jilin, the agency said in a
statement on its website today. The purchases began Nov. 1 and
end April 30, it said.  “The current market price for new-crop soybeans is about
3.90 yuan to 4 yuan per kilogram, exceeding the government’s
price,”  Chen Baomin , a manager at Jilin Grain Group Co., said
by phone from Dalian. Much of the local harvest is used to make
products for direct human consumption such as tofu and soya
sauce, while imported genetically modified beans with a higher
oil content are used for crushing into cooking oil and livestock
feed. China is the world’s biggest soybean importer.  The government will only buy beans harvested this year and
they must meet national standards, according to the statement.
China Grain Reserves Corp., or Sinograin, will administer the
procurement, the statement said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:  William Bi  in
