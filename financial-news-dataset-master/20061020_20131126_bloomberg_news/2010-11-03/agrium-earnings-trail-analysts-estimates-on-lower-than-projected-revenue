Agrium Inc. , North America’s third-
largest fertilizer maker by market value, reported third-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates as prices for nitrogen-
based crop nutrients rose less than projected.  Net income  more than doubled to $57 million, or 37 cents a
share, from $26 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, the
Calgary-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding stock-based compensation costs and gains on hedging
positions were 70 cents a share, the company said, trailing the
92-cent  average estimate  of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Agrium sold nitrogen fertilizer for an average of $305 a
metric ton in the quarter, up from $283 a year earlier, but less
than the $354 predicted by Edlain Rodriguez, a New York-based
analyst at Gleacher & Co.  Companywide sales rose 9.2 percent to $2.07 billion from
$1.89 billion. That missed the $2.11 billion average estimate of
16 analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  Agrium, in addition to producing nitrogen fertilizer, also
mines potash and makes phosphate-based nutrients and is the
largest agricultural retailer to U.S. farmers. Agrium is
benefitting from an upswing in global crop prices and farmers’
ability to afford more fertilizer and other agricultural inputs.  “We anticipate the strength in crop input demand and
prices to continue into the spring of 2011,” Chief Executive
Officer Mike Wilson said today in the statement.  Agrium  forecast  profit of $1 to $1.30 a share in the fourth
quarter, more than the $1 estimated by 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Agrium fell $2.30, or 2.6 percent, to $84.92 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares  are up
38 percent this year.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  and  Mosaic Co.  are the
two largest fertilizer makers in North America by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
