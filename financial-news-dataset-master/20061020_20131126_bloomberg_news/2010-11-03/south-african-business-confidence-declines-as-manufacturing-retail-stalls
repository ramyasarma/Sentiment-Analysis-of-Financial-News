South African business confidence
fell last month as manufacturing and retail sales growth slowed,
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry said.  The Business Confidence Index declined to 85.9 in October,
from 87.8 the month before, the Johannesburg-based chamber said
in an e-mailed statement today. The index is compiled from 13
economic indicators including retail sales, inflation, and
financial gauges such as the stock index and the currency.  “The Chamber is concerned that important contributors to
real economic activity, such as retail and manufacturing
volumes, recently lost momentum on a month-on-month basis,” the
statement said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
