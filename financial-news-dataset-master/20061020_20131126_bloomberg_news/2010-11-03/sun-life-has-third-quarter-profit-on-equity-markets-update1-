Sun Life Financial Inc. , the Canadian
insurer that agreed last month to sell a reinsurance business to
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported third-quarter net income of
C$453 million ($451 million) as stock markets improved.  Net income was 79 cents a share, compared with a net loss
of C$140 million, or 25 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based
company said today in a statement. Before one-time items, Sun
Life was expected to earn 63 cents a share, the average  estimate 
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canada’s third-largest insurer said results were boosted by
“improved performance in equity markets.” A year ago, the
company took a C$513 million charge to reflect updated
assumptions on interest rates.  Sun Life rose 24 cents to C$28.79 in trading today on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 4.8 percent this
year.  (Sun Life will hold a conference call tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Toronto time to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-644-3415
