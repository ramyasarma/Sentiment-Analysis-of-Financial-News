Asian currencies rose toward the
highest level since February 2008 on speculation a bond-purchase
program by the Federal Reserve will increase the amount of funds
that can be invested in higher-yielding regional assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index , which tracks the
10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, climbed 0.1 percent
to 115.87, just short of the high of 115.97 reached on Oct. 15.
The Philippine peso added 0.5 percent to 42.56 against the
greenback as of 4 p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. South Korea’s won advanced 0.3 percent to 1,110.28 and the
Thai baht rose 0.3 percent to 29.73.  “The Fed’s quantitative easing has two implications on the
currencies,” said  Nalin Chutchotitham , a Bangkok-based
financial markets analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl, Thailand’s third-
largest lender by assets. “One is capital inflows to the
emerging markets and the other is the U.S. growth aspect, as a
sustainable recovery in the U.S. will improve the export outlook
for Asia.”  The Fed bought $1.7 trillion of debt from December 2008
through March this year to help end a recession in the U.S.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict at least another $500
billion of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, will
be announced when a two-day meeting ends today.  Borrowing Costs  Overseas investors have pumped a net $45 billion into
Indian, South Korean and Taiwanese equities this year to benefit
from some of the world’s fastest growth rates. Asia’s developing
economies will expand 9.4 percent in 2010, compared with 2.7
percent in advanced countries, the International Monetary Fund
forecast in October.  The U.S. and Japan have cut benchmark interest rates to
near-zero and printed money to spur growth, while central banks
in India, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand have all
raised borrowing costs this year to contain inflation.  India’s rupee appreciated to a two-week high after the
Reserve Bank of India yesterday increased borrowing costs for a
sixth time this year.  The central bank lifted its repurchase rate by a quarter-
percentage point to 6.25 percent and the reverse repurchase rate
by the same margin to 5.25 percent, boosting the yield premium
on the country’s assets. Overseas investors have pumped a record
$8.7 billion into bonds this year.  “The rate hike will definitely bring in more dollars into
the market,” said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a Mumbai-based foreign-
exchange trader at Development Credit Bank.  The rupee climbed 0.1 percent to 44.355 touched 44.235, the
strongest level since Oct. 20.  Elsewhere, Singapore’s dollar added 0.1 percent to S$1.2871,
the Chinese yuan gained 0.1 percent to 6.6706 and Taiwan’s
dollar rose 0.2 percent to NT$30.65. Indonesia’s rupiah and
Malaysia’s ringgit were little changed at 8,918 and 3.085,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
