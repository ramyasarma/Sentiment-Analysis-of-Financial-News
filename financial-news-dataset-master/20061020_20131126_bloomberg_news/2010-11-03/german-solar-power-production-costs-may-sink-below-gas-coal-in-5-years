Electricity from solar panels in
Germany may be as cheap as power from new gas and coal plants
within five to eight years, a study by A.T. Kearney Inc. showed.  Production costs for solar power could be as low as 12.6
euro cents ($0.18) per kilowatt-hour by 2020 compared, with
about 15.6 cents for fossil-fuel electricity generation,
according to the study, which was commissioned by  Phoenix Solar
AG , a solar array developer.  That would represent almost half the current price for
solar-generated electricity of 23.9 cents per kilowatt hour. The
reduction depends on continued growth in demand for panels,
 Andreas Haenel , chief executive officer of Phoenix Solar, said
today at a briefing in Berlin.  Solar power costs are being unfairly compared with older
coal and nuclear power plants, making the costs for photovoltaic
and thin-film panels look more expensive than they are, the
study said. Newly-installed modules should be compared with new
natural gas or coal-fired plants, which would give a more
“realistic” assessment of the real economic costs of solar
energy, Haenel said at the briefing.  “This year was the first time that the economic benefits
of installed solar panels are greater than the costs,” he said,
citing the study, which considered the benefits of tax revenues
and lower carbon dioxide emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
