Local campaigners against a plan by
 Anglo American Plc  to mine copper and gold on the coast of
Bristol Bay, Alaska, are supported by some of the world’s
leading jewelers, including Tiffany & Co., Mappin & Webb
Holdings Ltd., Watches of Switzerland Ltd. and Fraser Hart Ltd.,
the London-based Times reported.  The jewelers say they won’t sell gold from the proposed
opencast mine, according to the newspaper.  Such mines are known for the environmental damage they
cause as a result of toxic leaks and spills, and the Bristol Bay
community is concerned that its salmon industry, worth $400
million a year, might be harmed, the Times said.  Fisherman Everett Thompson is one of four Bristol Bay
residents in London this week for talks with jewelers and Anglo
American officials; he told the newspaper that salmon fishing
has “provided for us for 9,000 years” and “we are trying to
keep our waters pristine so our salmon will support us for
generations to come.”  An Anglo American spokesman said the mining plan is still
at an exploratory stage and there’s not yet a plan on which an
“informed judgment” can be made, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
