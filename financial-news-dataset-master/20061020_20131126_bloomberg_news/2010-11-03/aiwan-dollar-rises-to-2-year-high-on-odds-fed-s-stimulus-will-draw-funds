Taiwan’s dollar strengthened to a
two-year high on speculation the Federal Reserve will say today
it plans to pump more cash into the economy to support growth,
increasing funds that can be invested in higher-yielding assets.  The currency also rose after overseas investors added to
purchases of the island’s equities, buying $925 million more
than they sold in the past two days and taking the year’s total
to $5.6 billion. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will probably
announce a plan to buy back at least $500 billion of long-term
securities, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The Fed’s easing adds to the trend that the Taiwan dollar
will rise because of hot-money inflows,” said  Eric Hsing , a
bond trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “The central
bank will continue to slow the currency’s gain.”  The Taiwan dollar appreciated 1 percent to NT$30.424
against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:54 a.m. local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency reached NT$30.375
earlier, the strongest level since July 2008.  The central bank has bought the U.S. dollar in the final
minutes of trading most days for more than six months, according
to traders familiar with the matter who declined to be
identified. The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)
said on Oct. 19 it will step into the foreign-exchange market
when the local dollar “overshoots.”  Benchmark 10-year bonds rose. The yield on the 1.125
percent note due September 2020 dropped one basis point to 1.269
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s
biggest exchange for debt.  To contact the reporter on the story:
