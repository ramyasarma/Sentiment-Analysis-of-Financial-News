PBL Media, which owns Australia’s
Nine Network and ACP Magazines, may be floated in March by
private equity firm CVC Asia Pacific Ltd. in a sale that could
value the company at more than A$5 billion, the Australian
Financial Review said.  Tim Parker, a London-based CVC Capital Partners executive
who was appointed PBL chairman in 2008, has told Australian
media executives the company will list that month, the newspaper
said, without saying where it got the information.  Local CVC executives denied a date has been set, the report
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
