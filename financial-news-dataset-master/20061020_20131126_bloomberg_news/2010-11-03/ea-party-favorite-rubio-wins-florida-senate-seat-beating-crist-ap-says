Former Florida House Speaker  Marco Rubio , propelled to the Republican nomination by Tea Party
support, was elected to the U.S. Senate, the Associated Press
projected.  Rubio, 39, defeated both Governor  Charlie Crist , 54,
running as an independent, and Representative  Kendrick Meek , 44,
the Democratic nominee. He will succeed  George LeMieux ,
appointed to fill the seat vacated when Republican  Mel Martinez 
resigned in 2009. LeMieux didn’t seek re-election.  Support for Rubio from Tea Party activists and other
conservatives such as Republican Senator  Jim DeMint  of South
Carolina fueled what began as a long-shot challenge to Crist,
who had the support of Republican Party leaders. Crist withdrew
from the Republican primary and launched an independent
candidacy in April. Meek won the August Democratic primary over
billionaire real estate investor Jeff Greene.  With 16 percent of the vote counted, Rubio had 50 percent
to 29 percent for Crist and 19 percent for Meek.  To contact the reporter on this story:
