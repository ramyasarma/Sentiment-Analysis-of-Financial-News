Hungarian private pension funds asked
the Constitutional Court to annul a law allowing the government
to direct social security contributions to the state budget.  President  Pal Schmitt  yesterday signed the bill into law,
channeling employee payments to pension funds to the government
from Nov. 1 through the end of 2011. The bill “hurts the rule of
law and ownership rights and contains elements that are
retroactive,” Stabilitas Penztarszovetseg, an industry group,
said on its  website  today.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is under European Union
pressure to narrow the budget  deficit  to 3.8 percent of economic
output this year and less than 3 percent next year. Orban,
elected in April on promises to end five years of austerity,
also levied special taxes on several industries to boost budget
revenue.  The redirection of pension payments, deducted monthly from
the paychecks of all employees, will yield about 420 billion
forint ($2.2 billion) in extra budget revenue over the next 14
months, Orban said last month.  Parliament is debating an amendment to the Constitution
that would strip the top court of its power to decide cases
relating to state finances, including taxes and the budget. The
amendment may prevent the court from hearing the case on the
suspension of pension payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
