Latin America stocks may rise a
further 15 percent by the end of 2010, led by gains in banks,
steelmakers and mining companies, according to a Banco Santander
SA poll of investors.  The  MSCI Latin America Index  may advance between 5 percent
and 15 percent, according to 64 percent of investors polled by
Santander last month, Ernest W. (Chip) Brown, a Santander
analyst, said today in a report.  “Our poll of quarterly investors suggests that the vast
majority of fund managers and hedge funds believe there are
still substantial gains to be made in equity investments in
Latin America,” Brown said.  The  MSCI EM Latin America Index  rose 11 percent this year,
twice the 5.6 percent gain in the MSCI World Index of shares in
developed markets. Capital inflows have flooded into developing
economies to yield better returns amid near-zero benchmark
interest rates in the U.S.  Argentina is the “big winner” among investment
destinations, according to the report, with about 36 percent of
the investors saying they would add funds to the market, up from
3 percent in July. Interest in Brazil remains “unabated,”
Brown said, and investors also seem to be shifting funds from
Chile and Mexico to Colombia and Peru, he said.  Oil and gas companies replaced food and beverage
manufacturers among the favored industries, he said.  The percentage of investors who said they are raising their
Latin American allocations by 10 percentage points to 36
percent from Santander’s July poll, Brown said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
