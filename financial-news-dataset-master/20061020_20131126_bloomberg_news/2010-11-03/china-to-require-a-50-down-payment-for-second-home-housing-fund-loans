China will require a 50 percent down
payment from buyers who use housing funds to purchase their
second home in a bid to curb speculation.  China will also prohibit use of the funds to buy third
homes, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and
the country’s banking regulator said in a joint  statement  today.
Residents must pay a portion of their income into the fund to be
eligible for low-interest loans, while their employers also
contribute.  The government has previously announced measures to cool
the property market and has suspended all mortgage lending to
third-home buyers, the government said on Sept. 30.  China will speed up the introduction of a trial property
tax in some cities before expanding the levy to the whole
country, the government said in September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
