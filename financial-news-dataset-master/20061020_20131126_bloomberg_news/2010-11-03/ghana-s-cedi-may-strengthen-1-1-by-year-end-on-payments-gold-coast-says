Ghana’s cedi is poised to strengthen
1.1 percent versus the dollar by the end of the year as exports
rise, boosting demand for the West African nation’s currency,
Gold Coast Securities Inc. said.  The cedi may appreciate to 1.4248 per dollar, Collins
Appiah, head of research at the Accra-based company, said in a
phone interview today. The currency snapped five days of
declines, gaining as much as 0.8 percent to 1.4290 per dollar
before trading unchanged at 1.4405 by 2:38 p.m. in Accra. The
cedi has appreciated 4.4 percent since reaching the weakest
level to the dollar on record in July 2009.  “Foreign direct investments, cocoa and gold proceeds
expected by the end of the year will help to keep the balance of
payments in surplus,” Appiah said.  Ghana is the continent’s second-largest gold producer after
South Africa and the world’s biggest grower of cocoa after
neighboring Ivory Coast. Gold, up 23 percent this year and
Ghana’s biggest foreign-exchange earner, is heading for a 10th
annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920.
 Bank of Ghana  estimates earnings from gold exports will climb to
$3.05 billion this year from $2.55 billion in 2009.  Ghana recorded a surplus of $199.7 million on its balance
of payments in the first half, from a deficit of $625.9 million
same period last year, Bank of Ghana said  Sept. 24 . The balance
of payments is expected to remain in surplus for the rest of the
year, Appiah said.  Bonds, Outlook  The central bank sold three-year bonds worth 457.4 million
cedis ($321.7 million), the fourth issue this year where
investor demand outstripped the amount offered on expectations
of faster economic growth. Foreign investors were able to bid
for the securities.  The oversubscription is evidence of the positive outlook
investors still have for the Ghanaian economy and the balance of
payments position should be further strengthened by inflows from
the last sale of three-year bonds for the year, Appiah said.  Ghana’s economic growth may average about 8 percent in the
next three to five years, compared with an expansion of 4
percent to 6 percent over the last few years, as crude output
from the Jubilee oil field begins, central bank Deputy Governor
 Kofi Wampah  said on Oct. 7.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
