German ten-year bunds advanced on
speculation the Federal Reserve will announce new asset
purchases today to underpin growth in the world’s largest
economy, lifting demand for the euro area’s safest securities.  The gains pushed the 10-year yield to its lowest since Oct.
25 before the Fed embarks on the second round of so-called
quantitative easing. Portugal plans to sell up to 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) of three-and twelve-month Treasury bills as
the nation’s parliament votes today on next year’s budget draft.
Germany auctions 5 billion euros of notes maturing in 2015.
Irish 10-year government bonds fell relative to bunds, driving
the  difference in yield  between the securities to a record.  “Bunds gained as a lot of investors looked to reduce their
exposure to anything except the safest assets ahead of the Fed
announcement,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-
rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “The Portuguese bill auction should pass smoothly as
the main political parties have agreed to the budget.”  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark security,
fell two basis points to 2.45 percent at 9:11 a.m. in London.
The 2.25 percent security maturing in September 2020 rose 0.20,
or 2 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.30. The two-year
note yield fell one basis point to 0.98 percent.  Irish Bonds  The Irish 10-year security tumbled for the seventh straight
day, sending the yield 10 basis points higher to 7.53 percent.
The difference in yield, or spread, between the bonds and German
bunds increased 10 basis points 493 basis points, according to
Bloomberg generic data. That’s the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1991.  Portuguese debt also declined, pushing the gap with German
10-year debt four basis points wider to 381 basis points.  German bonds have returned 8.4 percent this year, compared
with an 8.9 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  Irish bonds have lost 7.9 percent, while Portuguese debt
has lost 6.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
