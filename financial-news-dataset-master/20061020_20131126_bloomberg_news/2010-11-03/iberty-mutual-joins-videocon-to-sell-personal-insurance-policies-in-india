Liberty Mutual Holding Co., the
Boston-based insurer owned by policyholders, is joining with
Videocon Industries Ltd. to sell personal and commercial
coverage in India.  Liberty Mutual will initially hold a stake of as much as 26
percent in the venture and has the option to increase its
ownership when permitted by Indian law, the insurer said today
in a Business Wire statement. The new company will focus on
providing personal auto, health, home and accident insurance.  Liberty Mutual’s international operations generated about
$7.59 billion of revenue in 2009, a quarter of the firm’s total,
according to the company’s annual report. The insurer operates
in more than 20 nations, including Brazil, China, Chile and
India. Videocon, led by  Venugopal Dhoot , is an Indian consumer-
electronics maker.  India’s growing economy “means that ever more Indians will
be buying insurance to protect their property and possessions,”
Liberty Mutual Chief Executive Officer  Edmund Kelly  said in the
statement. Videocon’s “understanding of the Indian marketplace
and how to reach consumers is unparalleled.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
