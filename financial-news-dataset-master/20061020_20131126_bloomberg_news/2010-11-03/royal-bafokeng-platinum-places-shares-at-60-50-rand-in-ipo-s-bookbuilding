Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. , a South
African miner of the metal, said it placed shares at 60.50 rand
($8.78) each in a “strongly over-subscribed” bookbuild before
its initial public offering in Johannesburg.  The company placed 49.2 million shares with a value of 3
billion rand, representing a free float of 30 percent, RBPlat,
as the company is known, said in a statement today. The shares
are expected to start trading on the main board of JSE Ltd. on
Nov. 8, it said.  The IPO, the biggest in South Africa’s mining industry in
at least 16 years, follows share sales by  Optimum Coal Holdings
Ltd. , which raised 1.4 billion rand in a private placing before
listing in Johannesburg in March, and Keaton Energy Holdings
Ltd., which raised 100 million rand before its April 2008
listing.  RBPlat, a unit of Royal Bafokeng Holdings Ltd., needs funds
to develop the Styldrift 1 section of its Bafokeng Rasimone mine
venture northwest of Rustenburg. The Rasimone venture is 67
percent owned by Royal Bafokeng Platinum, while  Anglo Platinum
Ltd. , the world’s largest producer of the metal, holds the rest.  The venture produces about 270,000 ounces of platinum
concentrate a year and plans to spend 11.8 billion rand digging
the Styldrift 1 section.  To contact the reporter on this story:
