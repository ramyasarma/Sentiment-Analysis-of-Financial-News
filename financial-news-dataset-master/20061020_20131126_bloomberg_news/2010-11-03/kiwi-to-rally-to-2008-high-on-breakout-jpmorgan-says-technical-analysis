New Zealand’s dollar is set to rally
to a two-and-a-half year high versus its U.S. counterpart,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said, citing technical indicators.  The kiwi, as the South Pacific island nation’s currency is
known, broke through an October 2009 high of 76.37 U.S. cents
last week and has stayed above it this week. The “breakout”
could lead the New Zealand dollar as high as 79.20, a level last
reached in May 2008, technical analyst  Niall O’Connor  wrote in a
note to clients.  “The trending bias is back on track suggesting new highs
on the way,” New York-based O’Connor said.  The kiwi rose 0.6 percent to 77.59 U.S. cents at 9:07 a.m.
in New York, from 77.15 U.S. cents yesterday. It earlier reached
77.71 U.S. cents, the highest level since June 2008.  The next key resistance level is the 77.60-77.80 level,
where the New Zealand dollar could “pause,” O’Connor wrote.
Drops will be supported at 76.30-76.35 and at 75.55 U.S. cents.
Resistance is a level where sell orders may be clustered.  The currency has added 7.3 percent so far this year for the
fifth strongest performance against the dollar among the 16
major currencies.  Benchmark interest rates are 3 percent in New Zealand,
compared with as low as zero in the U.S. and Japan, attracting
investors to the South Pacific nation’s higher-yielding assets.  The Federal Reserve is expected by economists to announce
another round of large-scale asset purchases today, a measure
that analysts say may debase the U.S. dollar. Policy makers
completed $1.7 trillion of debt purchases in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
