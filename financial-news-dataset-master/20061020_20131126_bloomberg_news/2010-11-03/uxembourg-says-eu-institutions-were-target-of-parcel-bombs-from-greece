Luxembourg said it’s putting in place
“adequate measures” to protect recipients of “a series of”
parcels bombs that have been sent from Greece.  Luxembourg-based European Union institutions, such as the
EU’s highest court, have been among the known recipients of the
parcels that include explosives which detonate on opening, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
