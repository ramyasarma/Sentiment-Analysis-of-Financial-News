Ukraine’s local elections on Oct. 31
“did not meet standards for openness and fairness” set during
presidential balloting held earlier this year, the U.S. State
Department said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Domestic and international election observation efforts,
most notably those led by the widely-respected domestic, non-
partisan monitor OPORA, reported numerous procedural violations
on election day,” the State Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
