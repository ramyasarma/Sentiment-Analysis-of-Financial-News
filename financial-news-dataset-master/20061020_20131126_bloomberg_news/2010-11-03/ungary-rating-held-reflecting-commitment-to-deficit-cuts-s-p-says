Hungary’s commitment to cut its
budget deficit allowed Standard and Poor’s to maintain Hungary’s
credit rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade, the company
said today in a statement posted on its newswire.  Hungary’s budget plan at the same time harms medium-term
growth and doesn’t improve the “structural deficit,” S&P said.
The budget deficit may “approach” 6 percent of gross domestic
product by 2014, compared with the government’s 2.94 percent
target for next year, S&P said.  S&P put Hungary’s rating on review for a downgrade in July,
after the talks on economic policy failed between Hungary and
the International Monetary Fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
