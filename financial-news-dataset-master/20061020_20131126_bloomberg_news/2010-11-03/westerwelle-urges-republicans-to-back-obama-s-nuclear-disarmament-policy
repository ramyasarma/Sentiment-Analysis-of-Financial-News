German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  called on newly empowered Republicans in the U.S.
Congress to stand by President  Barack Obama ’s goals of non-
proliferation and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.  Westerwelle told German broadcaster ZDF that he expects
continuity in foreign policy, attributing Republican gains to
domestic concerns, the ministry said today in an e-mailed text
of his remarks. Those who expect Obama’s agenda overseas to be
weakened risk “massively underestimating” the Democratic
president, he said.  “We call on those with new responsibility in America to
continue to support President Obama’s course toward disarmament
and nuclear non-proliferation,” Westerwelle said today.  Republicans swept to a majority in the House of
Representatives, though Democrats held control in the Senate,
which must ratify a treaty that would reduce U.S. and Russian
nuclear arsenals. Obama and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, in
April. The original START accord expired last year.  The German minister said continuity in U.S. foreign policy
would underpin a cooperative relationship with the Obama
administration that was necessary for Germany, in contrast to
the unilateral polices of former President  George W. Bush .  “We don’t want the U.S. to go it alone in the world, as
was the case during the earlier administration of President
Bush,” Westerwelle said. “Rather, we want a cooperative
relationship.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
