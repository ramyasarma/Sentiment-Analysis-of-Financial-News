The New York Mets lowered ticket
prices for 2011 by an average of 14 percent following a
fourth-place division finish and falling attendance in
their second season at Citi Field.  Ticket prices for 62 percent of next season’s games at
the Queens borough ballpark will be reduced, the Major
League Baseball team said today in a news release. More
than half the 41,800 seats will see double-digit price
reductions, some by more than 30 percent.  Mets’ season-ticket holders will receive an additional
10 percent discount off the lowered 2011 prices. Renewal
invoices will be sent beginning next week, the team said.  The Mets drew 2.6 million fans to $850 million Citi
Field last season, down 600,000 from 2009. The team
finished with a 79-83 record, 18 games behind the National
League East-winning Philadelphia Phillies. New York missed
the playoffs for the fourth straight year and the ninth in
the last 10.  Some  seat categories  at Citi Field will see price
increases that average about 15 percent. The team also will
make 45 percent more tickets than last season available
that cost $15 or less. Single-game admission starts at $12.  The Mets hired  Sandy Alderson  last week as their
general manager, replacing  Omar Minaya , who was fired along
with manager  Jerry Manuel . The team likely will begin
interviewing managerial candidates this week, Alderson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
