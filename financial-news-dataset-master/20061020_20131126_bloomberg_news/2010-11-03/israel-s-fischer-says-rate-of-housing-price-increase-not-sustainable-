The rate of increase in Israeli
housing prices is “not sustainable” and could ultimately lead
to a large drop in both property and other asset prices, the
Bank of Israel said today.  Home purchase prices rose by 19 percent in the last year,
the bank said in its quarterly inflation report today. The
housing component of the consumer price index, which is based on
rental prices, is expected to increase by 8 percent in the next
four quarters, after rising 6 percent in the 12 months to
September, Governor  Stanley Fischer  said in a letter
accompanying the report.  “It is feared that a continued increase in house prices at
this pace will lead to a significant upward deviation from the
level that can be attributed to housing market fundamentals,”
the central bank said in its report. “That will eventually lead
to a large drop in the prices of real estate and as a result, in
the prices of other assets as well.”  The Bank of Israel raised its  benchmark interest rate  at
the end of September for a sixth time since the global economy
began to recover, citing the steep increase in housing prices
and rapid expansion of home loans. It also issued new directives
for banks aimed at slowing the rise in housing prices by raising
capital provisions against some categories of home loans.  “Recent rates of price increase, at around 20 percent per
annum, are not sustainable, and demand the attention of policy
makers,” Fischer said.  The governor also said that most indicators show continued
economic expansion, though at a slightly slower pace, in the
third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
