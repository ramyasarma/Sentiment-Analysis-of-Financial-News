New York’s thoroughbred horse racing
tracks are back on the A-list to host the Breeders’ Cup
Championships now that a casino at Aqueduct Racetrack is almost
complete.  “One thing that kept New York out of the rotation was a
financial concern,” Breeders’ Cup Chief Executive Officer  Greg Avioli  said in a telephone interview from Louisville, Kentucky.
“Now that they’ve reached an agreement with the state and the
casino is going in at Aqueduct, New York is back in the running
after 2011.”  The last Breeders’ Cup held in New York was in 2005 at
Belmont Park in Elmont, which also hosted the event in 1990,
1995 and 2001.  The casino at Aqueduct in Queens, operated by Genting New
York LLC, will have 4,525 slot machines that are expected to
produce at least $30 million a year for the state’s race tracks
and breeding operations, according to the New York Times.
Another $100 million annually will come from eight slot parlors
throughout the state.  The two-day Breeders’ Cup Championships, with 168 horses,
is a lucrative event for the host city. This year’s races begin
tomorrow at Churchill Downs in Louisville. The city expects
racegoers to spend about $4 million, according to the Louisville
Convention and Visitors Center.  Zenyatta, the 6-year-old undefeated mare that is going for
her record 20th consecutive win, has boosted interest in this
year’s Breeders’ Cup.  10-Year High  “Far and away this is the most interest in advance of the
Breeders’ Cup in the 10 years I’ve been here,” Avioli said.  The Breeders’ Cup, which carries a reserve of more than $35
million, expects to make $32 million to $34 million, compared
with an average of $15 million from 2001-2005 when the event was
only one day.  More than $10 million in tickets, discounted from last year
in recognition of the slumping economy, have been sold, compared
with an average of $7 million in previous years, Avioli said.  “I don’t think it could be any bigger than it is now,” he
said.  Zenyatta  will race before an estimated 80,000 fans at
Churchill Downs on Nov. 6 as she takes on 11 male contenders
over 1 1/4 miles in the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic, the
richest race in North America.  About 100,000 people are expected over the two days as 14
races, paying out $26 million in purses, will be run --including
the Ladies’ Classic tomorrow and the Classic the following
night, both of which will be under the lights for the first
time. Churchill Downs, which also will host next year’s
Breeders’ Cup, holds the records for the six biggest horse-
racing events in terms of attendance.  “It’s the two richest days of sports anywhere in the
world,” Avioli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
