Brazil’s central bank may buy dollars
in futures markets in a bid to avoid an excessive appreciation
of the real after the Federal Reserve announced it will buy an
additional $600 billion in Treasuries to stimulate the economy,
Guilherme Barros, a columnist at IG news services,  reported ,
without saying where he obtained the information.  The central bank may sell so-called reverse swaps or
increase the amount of dollars purchased in the spot market to
build the country’s reserves, Barros said. The government may
also use its sovereign wealth fund to buy dollars in the spot
market, Barros said.  A central bank spokesman wasn’t immediately available to
comment when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
