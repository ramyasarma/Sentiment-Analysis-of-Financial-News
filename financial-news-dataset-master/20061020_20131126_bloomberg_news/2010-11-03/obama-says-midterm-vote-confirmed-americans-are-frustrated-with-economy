President Barack Obama said
yesterday’s midterm congressional elections, in which
Republicans won a majority in the U.S. House, was more evidence
that the American people are “deeply frustrated” by the pace
of the economic recovery.  Obama, in his opening remarks at a White House news
conference, said he takes responsibility for that frustration
and said Democrats and Republicans must find common solutions.
No one party will be strong enough to impose its ideas, he said.  “Over the last two years, we’ve made progress but clearly,
too many Americans haven’t felt that progress yet, and they told
us that yesterday,” he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
