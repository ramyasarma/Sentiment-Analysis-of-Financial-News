Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index lost
217.01, or 1 percent, to 21,180.81 at the 5:30 p.m. close in
Milan, falling for the second day this week.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) lost 3.4
percent to 95.2 euro cents amid renewed concern that peripheral
euro-area countries cannot pay their debts. The cost of insuring
Irish sovereign debt surged to a record as credit-default swaps
on Allied Irish Banks Plc’s subordinated debt signaled a 63
percent probability of default within five years.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl  (PMI IM) slid 1.8 percent to
3.23 euros.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) sank 2.5 percent to
2.46 euros.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM) retreated 2.4 percent to 1.80
euros.  Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM) dropped 1.6
percent to 7.46 euros.  Bulgari SpA  (BUL IM) declined for the first time in five
days, dropping 2.3 percent to 7.75 euros. CA Cheuvreux resumed
coverage of the world’s third-largest jeweler with an
“underperform” rating.  “Based on valuation multiples, the market expects earnings
before interest and taxes to more than double to 160 million
euros rapidly,” the brokerage said in a note. “This seems to
be a challenging assumption.”  Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM) Italy’s second-biggest cement
maker, surged 2.9 percent to 8.37 euros, following gains
yesterday by U.S. companies such as Vulcan Materials Co.
 Italcementi SpA  (IT IM), the country’s biggest, advanced 2.5
percent to 6.21 euros.  The shares of distiller  Davide Campari-Milano SpA  (CPR IM)
retreated 2.7 percent to 4.50 euros. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV
dropped the most in almost three months as the brewer’s profit
growth missed estimates.  Fiat SpA  (F IM) gained 2.9 percent to 12.19 euros, erasing
two days of declines. UBS AG upgraded Fiat to “buy” from
“neutral.” The brokerage predicts that the company’s auto
business will surprise “cyclically, with excess cash generation
from working capital when the macro cycle turns.”  Exor SpA  (EXO IM) advanced for a second day this week,
rising 3.2 percent to 19 euros. Fiat’s main shareholder had its
price estimate lifted to 25.60 euros from 19 euros at UBS, which
said that Exor will “reap the benefits” from any restructuring
of the carmaker’s auto and industrial divisions.  Fondiaria-SAI SpA  (FSA IM) lost 2.5 percent to 7.57 euros,
taking this week’s loss to 11 percent. Banca Akros downgraded
the insurer to “hold” from “accumulate.” The brokerage said
in a note that the stock’s “low valuation clearly reflects
investor concerns on a possible capital shortfall at group
level.”  Piaggio & Cie. SpA  (PIA IM) lost 2.9 percent to 2.53 euros,
extending yesterday’s drop. Fidentiis Equities SV SA said in a
note that Piaggio “remains a sell.”  Immsi SpA  (IMS IM) sold 5
million shares, or 1.35 percent, of the scooter maker to
institutional investors through Banca IMI SpA.  Prelios SpA  (PRS IM), formerly Pirelli Real Estate SpA,
gained 4.8 percent to 43.8 euro cents. The company said it
posted a net loss of 29.6 million euros ($41.5 million) in the
first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 57.9
million euros a year earlier.  Saras SpA  (SRS IM) fell for a second day, losing 2.2
percent to 1.53 euros. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
reiterated an “underperform” rating on the refiner ahead of
quarterly results, due on Nov. 12.  “We expect there was little respite for refining earnings
during the third quarter,” the brokerage said in a note. “This
should bring into sharp focus the fact that in this refining
environment, a very high complexity refinery such as Saras’s
Sarroch, is poorly exposed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
