White sugar futures climbed to the
highest price since January in London as rains cut production in
Brazil, the world’s biggest producer, and on investor concern
that India may cap exports to boost domestic supplies.  Output  in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s biggest
producing-region, tumbled 30 percent in the first half of
October from the same period a year earlier to 26.1 million
metric tons, industry association Unica said on Oct. 28, citing
rainfall at the beginning of the month. Production declined 4
percent from the previous two-week period. Stockpiles in India,
the second-largest grower, are about 4 million tons, compared
with the nation’s preferred level of 10 million tons, according
to Rabobank International.  “The white sugar price is moving in unison with the raw
sugar rally, which reached a 29-year high yesterday,” said
 Peter De Klerk , a London-based analyst at C. Czarnikow Sugar
Futures Ltd. “The latest set of Unica figures for Brazil have
been perceived as rather disappointing.”  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery gained for the
third day, climbing $5.50, or 0.7 percent, to $752.50 a ton on
NYSE Liffe at 11:07 a.m. London time. The futures earlier
climbed to $756.60, the highest price for a most-active contract
since Jan. 26.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.19 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 30.31 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
gaining for a sixth day. Yesterday, the price reached 30.64
cents a pound, the highest level for a most-active contract
since Jan. 15, 1981.  Indian Exports  India, the largest sugar user, may export less than
forecast and shipments should be spread out to prevent global
prices from slumping, a millers’ group said.  The surplus available for sales overseas may be 2 million
tons in the year started Oct. 1, compared with the 2.5 million
tons forecast in September, as industrial users rebuild
stockpiles after two years of imports, according to the  National
Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.   The government may consider allowing exports in the second
week of this month, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said last week.
Shipments may resume next month and the government is likely to
hasten applications from mills for about 500,000 tons, Economic
Times reported today, citing an official it didn’t identify.  Ivory Coast, the world’s largest grower of cocoa, held its
first presidential election in a decade on Oct. 31. President
 Laurent Gbagbo  currently leads with votes counted from more than
half of the country’s 19 regions, and hasn’t reached the
majority needed to avoid a second-round run-off scheduled for
Nov. 28.  Development Stunted  Economic development has been stunted since a 2002 military
uprising led to civil conflict and division between a rebel-held
north and a government-controlled south. The country relies on
cocoa for more than a quarter of its export earnings.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 9 pounds, or 0.5 percent,
to 1,861 pounds ($3,001) a ton in London, following yesterday’s
climb of 1.5 percent. The chocolate ingredient for December
delivery added $8, or 0.3 percent, to $2,813 a ton in New York.  Robusta coffee for January delivery climbed $20, or 1
percent, to $1,959 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for
December delivery added 0.70 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.001 a
pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
