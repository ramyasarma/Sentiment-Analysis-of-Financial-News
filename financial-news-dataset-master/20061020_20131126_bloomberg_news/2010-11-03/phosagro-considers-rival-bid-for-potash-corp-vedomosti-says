OAO PhosAgro, Russia’s largest maker
of phosphate fertilizers, is considering a bid for Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc.,  Vedomosti  reported, citing a company
document.  PhosAgro Chairman  Vladimir Litvinenko  wrote to Russian
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  on Oct. 20 asking for state
credits to make the acquisition, the Moscow-based daily said,
citing the letter. Putin forwarded the request to Deputy Prime
Minister  Igor Sechin , who contacted relevant ministries and
state banks, said Vedomosti, without citing anyone. One
possibility is a merger of PhosAgro and Potash Corp., it cited a
person close to PhosAgro as saying.  Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  plans to announce
his decision on whether to approve BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40
billion bid for Potash Corp. today after markets close in New
York, said an official familiar with the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
