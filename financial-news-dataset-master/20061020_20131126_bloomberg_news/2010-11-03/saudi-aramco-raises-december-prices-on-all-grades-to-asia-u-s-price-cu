Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, raised official selling prices on all
crude grades for customers in Asia for December, in a third
consecutive monthly increase as refiners’ profits climbed.  The company increased the formula price for  Arab Super
Light  crude to Asia the most, raising it by $1.45 a barrel to a
$3.35 premium over the average of Oman and Dubai grades,
according to a person familiar with the pricing decision.  Aramco, the world’s largest crude exporter, lowered its
price formula on light and medium grades to the U.S. by 5 cents
a barrel for December and left prices for Extra Light and Arab
Heavy crudes unchanged, the person said.  Crude oil for December delivery rose 0.6 percent on the New
York Mercantile Exchange during October to $81.43 a barrel at
the close of trading on Oct. 29. Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi 
said this week that crude-importing countries are happy with
prices between $70 and $90 a barrel, a broader range than the
$70-to-$80 spread that he said on March 30 was “as close to
perfect as possible.”  The Saudi company set the price for its Arab Light crude
oil for December loadings for U.S. buyers at a discount of 25
cents a barrel to the  Argus Sour Crude Index . Arab Medium will
sell at a discount of $1.90 to ASCI.  Cuts to Europe  Aramco will cut prices on all crude grades to the
Mediterranean and on most oil types to Northwest Europe for
December. The price for Extra Light crude to Northwest Europe
will remain unchanged from November.  Buyers in Asia will pay 95 cents a barrel more for  Arab
Extra Light  crude in December after Aramco raised the price
formula to $1.80 above the Oman and Dubai average. Oman and
Dubai crudes are the two Gulf benchmarks for traders in Asia.
Arab Light shipments to Asia next month will cost 40 cents more,
at a premium of 35 cents a barrel over the benchmark.  Increases for Extra Light and Light grades to Asia exceeded
the expectations of eight regional refinery officials in a
Bloomberg News survey. Refiners had expected a 40-cents-a-barrel
rise in the price of Arab Extra Light and a 35-cents-a-barrel
advance in the price of Arab Light.  Saudi Arabia, the largest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and the group’s de-facto leader,
pushed for the production cuts that OPEC announced in 2008 to
try to support prices. OPEC decided in Vienna on Oct. 14 to
leave quotas unchanged. Member countries, many of whom are
exceeding their quotas to take advantage of prices that rallied
78 percent last year, will meet next in Quito, Ecuador in
December.  Volumes to Asia  Aramco raised November prices for all crude grades for
customers in Asia and on light and medium blends to the U.S. The
company boosted prices across the board on all grades to all
buyers for October delivery. Aramco has supplied full volumes to
refiners in Asia since last December.  Saudi Arabia was the fourth-biggest exporter of crude to
the U.S. last year, dropping from second place in 2008, data
from the U.S.  Energy Information Administration  show. Canada,
Mexico and Venezuela all shipped more crude to the U.S., the
data show.  The kingdom has joint-venture refinery projects in China
and is seeking to strengthen its role as a supplier to Asia as
demand from the U.S. and Europe has slipped with the global
financial crisis. Aramco, the world’s largest oil company based
on reserves, exported less crude to the U.S. and Europe as a
percentage of total shipments last year.  Oil exports to Asia increased as China bought on average
more than 1 million barrels of Saudi crude a day last year,
Aramco said in its June annual review.  Crude exports to the U.S. slipped to 14 percent of Aramco’s
total last year from 20 percent in 2008. Shipments to Asia
represented 56 percent of the total in 2009, compared with a
52.7 percent share in 2008. Exports to Europe slipped to 4.4
percent last year from 5.2 percent in 2008.  The following table gives the differentials of the four
