Nigeria appointed Citigroup Inc. and
Deutsche Bank AG to act as bookrunners for its $500 million
Eurobond sale, said a spokesman for Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga .  “Six companies went through the final process, out of
which these two were chosen,” Okwudili Ojukwu-Enendu said by
phone from the capital, Abuja, today.  Barclays Capital and FBN Capital Ltd., a unit of  First Bank
of Nigeria Plc , were last month named as advisers for the sale,
which Aganga said on Sept. 3 will act as a benchmark for local
companies to price their bonds. Nigeria expects to conclude the
sale by the middle of December Abraham Nwankwo, director-general
of the country’s Debt Management Office, said yesterday.  The continent’s largest oil producer and sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-biggest economy plans to use funds from the sale
to develop roads, railways and housing and reduce dependence on
oil exports, the source of more than 80 percent of government
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
