Executives at publicly-traded French
companies face tighter insider-trading rules that would
standardize when executives are able to buy and sell shares.  “Quasi-permanent insiders” who know privileged
information about their companies should have an independent
manager handle their portfolios and create trading plans at
least three months before any trade, the  Autorite des Marches
Financiers  said today. Companies should designate an internal
ombudsman for insiders to consult and introduce black-out
periods of 30 days before publishing reports, the AMF said.  “Many of these practices are already put in place, but in
a heterogeneous manner,” said  Benoit de Juvigny , a member of
the report group, at today’s  presentation . “We hope that these
will be successful, but I am almost certain some will find it
too restrictive.”  The AMF was criticized for its handling of a three-year
insider-trading probe of  European Aeronautic Defence and Space
Co.  that ultimately led to no findings of wrongdoing. The AMF
studied U.S. and U.K. treatment of insider trading in drafting
the  recommendations , which will be reviewed after three years to
see how companies implemented them and whether they were
effective.  To contact the reporter on this story:
