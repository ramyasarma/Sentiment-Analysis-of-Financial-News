RealD Inc. , the maker of 3-D movie
projectors that first sold stock to the public in July, rose
22 percent in New York after reporting second-quarter results
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  RealD jumped $4.75 to $26.96 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading after reaching a  record  $27.76. The
Beverly Hills, California-based company, which also distributes
the glasses viewers use to watch three-dimensional movies, sold
12.5 million shares at $16 each on July 15.  Sales in the quarter ended Sept. 24 rose 69 percent to
$65.3 million, the company said yesterday in a statement. That
exceeded the $49 million average  estimate  of five analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The net loss narrowed to $5.1 million, or 12
cents a share, from $5.4 million, or 22 cents, and was smaller
than the 22-cent loss predicted by analysts.  The number of RealD screens almost tripled to 9,300 by the
end of the quarter, the company said in the statement. They
included 5,600 in the U.S.  This quarter, RealD expects to add 1,800 to 2,200 screens,
 Andrew Skarupa , chief financial officer, said yesterday on a
conference call. Capital spending on RealD Cinema Systems for
the full year will be $70 million to $75 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
