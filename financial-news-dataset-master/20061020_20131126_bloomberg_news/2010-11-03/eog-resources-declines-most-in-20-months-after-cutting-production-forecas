EOG Resources Inc.  declined the most
in more than 20 months after cutting its production forecast
through 2012 as it moves to more oil output from natural gas.  EOG  fell  $9.10, or 9.1 percent, to $88.64 as of 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the largest
decline since February 2009.  The company yesterday reduced its forecast for production
growth this year, excluding acquisitions, to 9 percent from 13
percent, citing low natural-gas prices and equipment-related
delays. The growth forecast is now 10 percent for next year and
12 percent for 2012, Houston-based EOG said in a statement. The
company  last month  predicted 19 percent and 21 percent growth
for those years.  “It’s a gas company that wants to become an oil company,”
said  Brian Lively , an analyst with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. in
Houston who has a “hold” rating on EOG shares and owns none.
“It has great assets and great leverage to oil shales, but this
transition is going to be capital intensive and it’s going to
cost more than what prior expectations were.”  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Papa  said in yesterday’s
statement that about 67 percent of the company’s North American
revenue will be derived from petroleum liquids next year. That
compares with about 77 percent coming from natural gas in 2007,
according to an EOG slide presentation.  Crude oil futures prices in New York during the third
quarter averaged $76.21 a barrel, more than three times the
price of gas on an energy-equivalent basis.  Asset Sales  EOG will try to sell gas assets next year, with proceeds
used to fill any gap between estimated cash flows and capital
spending, according to the statement.  EOG, in its slide presentation, said it expects to close on
$600 million to $1 billion in asset sales by the end of this
year. The company said it plans another $1 billion or more in
sales in 2011 mostly related to gas acreage or production.  The company said it will raise its debt levels so it can
fund drilling in petroleum liquids projects.  Also yesterday, EOG reported a third-quarter net loss of
$70.9 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with net income of
$4.2 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
