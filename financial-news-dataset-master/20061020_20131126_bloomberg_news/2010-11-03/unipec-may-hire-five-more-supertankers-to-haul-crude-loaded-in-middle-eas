China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., known as Unipec, has provisionally hired five
supertankers to ship crude from the Middle East, adding to eight
vessels that were chartered last week to load in November.  The trading unit of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., the
country’s largest oil refiner, may load as much as 3.51 million
metric tons, or more than 25 million barrels, based on fixtures
reported Oct. 26 and today by BRS Brokers. Each vessel is a Very
Large Crude Carrier used to carry crude or fuel oil.  China, which overtook the U.S. last year as the world’s
biggest energy user, may be boosting its strategic stockpiles as
its crude surplus rises to a record. The country is executing
the second of a three-phase project to build emergency oil
reserves. Work started last year on storage tanks in the western
province of Xinjiang.  “The big jump in the surplus crude suggests that China is
accelerating the buying pace, possibly as a hedge against the
depreciating U.S. dollar,”  Gordon Kwan , head of regional energy
research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd., said today in a note.  Yesterday, Unipec sought a VLCC to ship oil this month from
Europe to China, according to Clarkson Asia, a unit of the
world’s largest shipbroker. The Chinese company failed an
earlier bid to book the Al Salheia to load from the North Sea.  Following is a table showing the vessels hired by Unipec to
load crude from the Middle East this month for shipment to
China, according to shipbroker reports. Some dates are still
provisional.  To contact the reporter on this story:
