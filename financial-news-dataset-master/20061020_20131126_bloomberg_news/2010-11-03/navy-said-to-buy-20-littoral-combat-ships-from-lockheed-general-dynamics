The U.S. Navy may purchase 20
Littoral Combat Ships from  Lockheed Martin Corp.  and  General
Dynamics Corp. , two people familiar with the matter said.  The Navy, which had previously planned to purchase only 10
ships, will now purchase 10 from each company, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the agreement hasn’t been
made public. The contract awards will be announced tomorrow,
said one of the people.  The award would reverse the Navy’s plan announced in
September 2009 to pick only one of the two ship designs. The
ships will cost $480 million each, according to an  estimate  by
the Congressional Research Service. The Navy ultimately plans to
buy 55 ships in the class.  To contact the reporters on this story:
