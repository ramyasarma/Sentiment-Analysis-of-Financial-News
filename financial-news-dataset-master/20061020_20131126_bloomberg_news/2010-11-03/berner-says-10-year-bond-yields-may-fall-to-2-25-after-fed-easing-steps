The yield on the 10-year U.S.
Treasury note may fall to 2.25 percent should the Federal
Reserve renew large-scale asset purchases, said  Richard Berner ,
co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley in New York.  “I think we are already in a new rate regime,” Berner
said in a Bloomberg Television interview on “Surveillance
Midday” with  Tom Keene . “I think the Fed is trying to make
sure we don’t become Japan. That is really the effort.”  The Federal Reserve today will probably restart purchases
of bonds to spur the economy with unemployment near 10 percent
and inflation below its target, according to Bloomberg News
surveys of economists. The Fed will likely pledge to buy $500
billion or more in securities, according to 29 of 56 economists
surveyed.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell five basis
points to 2.54 percent at 12:24 p.m. today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
