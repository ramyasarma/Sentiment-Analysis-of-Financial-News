South Korea’s navy fired warning
shots to drive away a North Korean fishing boat that had crossed
the western sea border between the two nations.  The boat entered South Korean waters today shortly after 7
a.m. local time and retreated after 10 warning shots around 10
a.m., an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, confirming
a  Yonhap News  report. The official in Seoul declined to be named
because of military policy.  The intrusion comes as South Korea readies as many as
60,000 police and troops to guard the security of Group of 20
leaders who will gather in Seoul on Nov. 11-12. South Korean
President  Lee Myung Bak  said today he didn’t expect North Korea
to pose any threats during the summit.  “We are fully prepared,” he told reporters today in
Seoul. “But, I don’t expect North Korea to take any action when
global leaders gather.”  South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea
because the 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce and no peace
treaty has been signed. Tensions on the peninsula have
heightened since the South accused the North of torpedoing one
of its warships in March, killing 46 sailors.  South Korea and North Korea exchanged fire at the border on
Oct. 29 without reporting any casualties. In May, South Korea
fired warning shots after two North Korean patrol ships crossed
the western sea border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
