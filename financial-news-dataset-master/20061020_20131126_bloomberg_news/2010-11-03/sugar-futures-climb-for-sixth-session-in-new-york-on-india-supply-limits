(Corrects spelling of cocoa in headline.)  Raw sugar rose for a sixth session,
trading near a 29-year high, on concern that shipments will be
limited from India, the world’s second-largest producer. Cocoa
and coffee prices dropped, while orange juice gained.  The surplus available for overseas sales may be 2 million
metric tons, 20 percent less than a September forecast, an
Indian millers group said. Last year, India became the world’s
biggest importer as adverse weather damaged crops. Stockpiles
are about 4 million tons, compared with the nation’s preferred
level of 10 million tons, according to Rabobank International.
Sugar prices in New York have advanced 12 percent this year.  “The whole question is actually how much” sugar India
will ship, said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures
in Tampa, Florida. “They’re not going to open up the floodgates
and let it all come out at once.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.03 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at 30.15 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price fluctuated today, falling as
much as 1.8 percent to 29.58 cents. Yesterday, the sweetener
reached 30.64 cents, the highest level since Jan. 15, 1981.  Shipments should be spread out in stages to prevent prices
from slumping, the millers group said.  “India is looking at keeping these prices high, which is
good for them,” Tintle said.  Brazil Supply Drops  Prices also climbed amid signs that production is declining
in Brazil, the world’s largest grower.  Output in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s biggest
producing-region, tumbled 30 percent in the first half of
October from the same period a year earlier, industry
association Unica said on Oct. 28.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery rose
$1.80, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $748.80 a metric ton at 5:30
p.m. local time on NYSE Liffe. Earlier, the commodity climbed to
$756.60, the highest price for a most-active contract since Jan.
26.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell $41, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $2,764 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa
futures for December delivery dropped 43 pounds, or 2.3 percent,
to settle at 1,827 pounds ($2,940) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery declined 3.25
cents, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $1.9615 a pound in New York.
On NYSE Liffe, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery fell
$7, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $1,932 a ton.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery gained 0.35 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to settle at $1.6245 on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
