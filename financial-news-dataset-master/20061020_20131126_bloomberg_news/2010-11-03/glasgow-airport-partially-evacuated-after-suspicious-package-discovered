Part of Glasgow Airport’s main
passenger terminal was evacuated yesterday evening after
security staff found a suspicious package. Police said the
incident turned out to be a false alarm.  The item was discovered at 7:55 p.m. local time, according
to a statement from Strathclyde Police. Officers attended the
scene at the airport’s central search area, airport spokesman
Neil Richardson said by telephone. Police later said the airport
had acted correctly, while the package was found to be safe.  Security has been heightened at airports across the world
after the discovery last week of air-freight bombs originating
in Yemen and bound for synagogues in Chicago.  This week, explosives in parcels were sent to a number of
embassies in Athens and one was posted from Greece to the office
of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Greece suspended mail
deliveries to foreign destinations for 48 hours.  Glasgow is Scotland’s largest city and its airport handles
about 8 million passengers a year, according to its  website . The
top destinations from the airport are Heathrow and Gatwick
airports in London, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
