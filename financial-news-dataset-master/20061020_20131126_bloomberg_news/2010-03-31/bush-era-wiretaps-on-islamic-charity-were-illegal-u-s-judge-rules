The U.S. Treasury Department’s use
of classified information to designate a now defunct Oregon
Islamic charity as a terrorist organization was upheld by a
federal appeals court in  San Francisco .  While the Office of Foreign Assets Control violated Al-
Haramain Islamic Foundation Inc.’s constitutional rights to due
process by failing to give the charity a chance to respond or an
unclassified summary of the information it was using, the
designation as a terrorist group wouldn’t have been altered, the
court said today.  “Those constitutional errors were harmless,” a three-judge
panel said.  The court ruled that the government improperly seized the
group’s assets without a warrant.  Tracy Schmaler , a spokeswoman for the  Justice Department ,
and David Cole, an attorney for the charity, didn’t immediately
respond to voice-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling.  The foundation was a target of a Treasury Department
program to track financing of terrorism activities and was
designated as a “global terrorist” in 2004. The Treasury
Department said the group had ties to  Osama bin Laden  and that
funds donated to the group to support Chechen refugees “were
diverted to support Mujahedeen as well as Chechen leaders
affiliated with the al Qaeda network,” according to the ruling.
The group said it had no connection to terrorism, according to
the ruling.  The case is Al Haramain v. U.S. Department of Treasury, 10-
35032,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit, San
Francisco  To contact the reporters on this story:
