U.S. stocks slid, with benchmark
indexes falling for the third time this week, after Cisco
Systems Inc. and Walt Disney Co. missed analyst estimates and
concern over Europe’s debt crisis intensified.  Cisco , the sixth-largest U.S. technology company by market
value, plunged 16 percent, the most since 1994. Hewlett-Packard
Co. slumped 2.4 percent as technology stocks declined the most
among 10 industries in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Disney
fell 2.9 percent. GameStop Corp. rallied 4.8 percent after the
video-game retailer said it will add content to its digital
catalog.  The  S&P 500  dropped 0.4 percent to 1,213.54 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The Nasdaq-100 Index, which gets 65 percent of its
value from computer-related companies, lost 0.7 percent to
2,173.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.94 points, or
0.7 percent, to 11,283.10.  “With the weak forecast from Cisco, investors are
obviously concerned about the technology spending environment,”
said  Ryan Bend , a money manager at Federated Investors’ Prudent
Bear Fund, which manages about $1.9 billion. “Less appetite for
risk globally accompanied with weak guidance from technology
companies are giving people some pause here. The markets have
had quite a run and people are a little bit nervous right now.”  Technology companies had led the 16 percent rally in the
S&P 500 since the end of August, rising 23 percent as a group
through yesterday for the biggest advance among 10 industries.
Net income has grown 52 percent for technology firms that
reported quarterly results since Oct. 7, trailing only financial
companies among 10 groups.  Sixth Straight Quarter  Cisco  tumbled 16 percent to $20.52. The company said fiscal
second-quarter profit excluding some items will range between 32
cents and 35 cents a share, less than the average analyst
estimate of 42 cents, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales will amount to about $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion, while
analysts projected $11.1 billion.  The projection from Cisco, the world’s largest producer of
computer-networking equipment, tempered enthusiasm about
corporate earnings driven by more than 70 percent of S&P 500
companies beating the average profit estimate for a record sixth
straight quarter. Quarterly results and the Federal Reserve’s
$600 billion attempt to spur economic growth in the world’s
biggest economy helped produce the biggest September-and-October
U.S. stocks rally since 1998.  ‘Challenging’  Cisco faced a “challenging economic environment” last
quarter, Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  said. He blamed
the slump on lower government spending in developed countries
and market-share losses.  Technology stocks fell 1.8 percent today, the most among 10
groups in the S&P 500.  Hewlett-Packard  slid 2.4 percent to
$43.10.  Disney lost 2.9 percent to $35.93. The world’s biggest
media company reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit excluding
some items of 45 cents, missing the average analyst estimate of
47 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
posted the earnings statement on its website before the close of
U.S. exchanges.  “Like Cisco, Disney is the kind of company that’s held to
high regard, and they basically disappointed,” said  Jason Cooper , who oversees $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana, at 1st
Source Investment Advisors. The firm owns Disney shares. “We
had such negative news today it probably didn’t matter who you
were, if you had any kind of miss or blip, you were going to get
punished. This will probably continue to add negative pressure
when we see stocks open tomorrow.”  Portugal, Spain  U.S. stocks fell as Portuguese and Spanish government bonds
declined on mounting concern that nations on Europe’s periphery
will be forced to restructure their debt. The yield on Irish 10-
year securities surged to a record 6.52 percentage points over
benchmark German bunds.  The S&P 500 almost erased yesterday’s gain and is down 1
percent from a two-year high reached Nov. 5. Shares rallied last
week after the Fed announced plans to buy $600 billion in
Treasuries and as elections resulted in a divided Congress
that’s unlikely to pass further business reforms.
      Boeing Co . fell 2.5 percent to $65.37, the lowest intraday
price since Sept. 28 and the third-biggest decline in the Dow.
Boeing should know “fairly quickly” whether this week’s fire
during a test flight of a 787 Dreamliner will affect the jet’s
entry into service, already almost three years late, Chief
Executive Officer Jim McNerney said today. All six test jets
have been grounded indefinitely while the company analyzes the
data from the Nov. 9 emergency landing in Texas.  GameStop rallied 4.8 percent to $21.10, the biggest gain in
the S&P 500. The Grapevine, Texas-based company said in a
statement it will add content from Sony Corp. to its catalog of
products available through digital downloads.  H&R Block Inc.  advanced 4.4 percent to $12.80. The largest
U.S. tax preparer said while its lawsuit is pending with its
refund-anticipation loan provider, the parties are in talks
trying to settle the litigation to confirm the availability of
settlement products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
