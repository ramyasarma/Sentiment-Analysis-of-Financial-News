SB LiMotive Co., a venture between
 Samsung SDI Co.  and Robert Bosch GmbH, aims to make lithium-ion
cells at a plant in Ulsan, South Korea, for use in 180,000
electric cars annually by 2015 to meet demand for the vehicles.  Bosch  and Samsung SDI today opened the factory in Ulsan,
southeast of Seoul, which will start mass production of the
cells early next year, SB LiMotive said in an e-mailed statement.
The companies said they will jointly invest about $500 million
in the venture by 2013.  Toyota Motor Corp. , Nissan Motor Co. and General Motors Co.
are among carmakers spending billions of dollars to speed
development of autos that use less or no petroleum to curb
greenhouse gases, spurring investment in the electric and
hybrid-car battery business. Plug-in cars such as Nissan’s Leaf
model and General Motors’ Volt could make up 9 percent of U.S.
auto sales by 2020 and 22 percent in 2030, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance said last month.  SB LiMotive will supply lithium-ion battery packs to
Chrysler Group LLC as well as cells to Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG from 2012, Lee Jin Gun, the venture’s chief executive officer,
said in Ulsan today at the opening of the new plant.  Shares Advance  Samsung SDI, which Information Technology estimates may
become the world’s biggest maker of lithium-ion batteries this
year, rose 0.9 percent to 160,500 won as of 1:27 p.m. in Seoul
trading. The company, based in Yongin, South Korea, has gained
8.1 percent this year.  Stuttgart, Germany-based Bosch, the world’s largest auto-
parts maker, formed the venture with  Samsung SDI  in 2008 to
produce batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. The venture
was set up in South Korea and began production in 2010.  SB LiMotive is currently in talks with other carmakers from
Europe, the U.S. and Asia, Samsung SDI CEO  Choi Chi Hun  said
today at the factory opening without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
