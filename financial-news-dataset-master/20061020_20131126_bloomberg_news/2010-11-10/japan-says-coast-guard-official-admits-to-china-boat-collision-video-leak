Japan said a Coast Guard staff
member confessed to leaking a video to YouTube of a collision
between its vessels and a Chinese fishing trawler that marred
bilateral relations.  Coast Guard Commandant Hisayasu Suzuki told a parliamentary
committee today that a staff member in Kobe told his boss he had
posted the video last week. The person is under investigation,
Suzuki said.  Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have
deteriorated since the Sept. 7 collision in the East China Sea
near uninhabited islands administered by Japan and also claimed
by China. The 17-day detention of the fishing boat captain
spurred the Chinese government to suspend ministerial talks and
halt exports of rare earth metals to Japan.  The video’s leak came a week before Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  hosts the Nov. 13-14 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Yokohama. Kan said today it is undecided whether he will hold
talks with Chinese President  Hu Jintao  at the summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
