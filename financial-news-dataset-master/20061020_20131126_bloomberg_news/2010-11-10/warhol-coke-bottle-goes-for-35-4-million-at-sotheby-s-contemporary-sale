Andy Warhol ’s painting of a Coca-
Cola bottle sold for $35.4 million at  Sotheby’s  yesterday,
making the artist the star of New York’s contemporary art
auctions for two nights running as the market recovers slowly
from a slump.  While eight bidders vied for the 7-foot-tall Warhol, they
failed to reproduce the drama at rival Phillips de Pury & Co. a
day earlier, when another 1962 Warhol, of actress  Elizabeth Taylor , sold for $63 million.  “It was not frothy,” said dealer  Harry Blain  after the
$222.5 million sale, the largest in the category since May 2008.
“It was good, solid, considered buying, nothing outlandish.”  Author  James Frey , fashion designer  Valentino Garavani  and
 Michael Dell ’s money manager,  Glenn Fuhrman , were at the front
of the saleroom as 91 percent of the 54 lots found buyers. Five
artist auction records were set, including  Julie Mehretu  and
Larry Rivers, helping the total rise just above the $214.5
million presale high estimate, which does not include
commissions. A year ago, Sotheby’s contemporary sale tallied
$134 million.  “It was incredibly strong considering that we are kicking
ourselves out of a recession,” said New York dealer Jack Tilton.  Warhol dominates the week’s contemporary sales, with 19
works at Sotheby’s and  Christie’s International . Tonight,
Christie’s offers his 1962 “Big Campbell’s Soup Can with Can
Opener (Vegetable),’’ with a high estimate of $50 million.      The
artist, who died in 1987, has seen a revival at auctions since
prices for contemporary works slumped in 2008.  ‘Name Your Price’  “Warhol has been the driver of the postwar- and
contemporary-art market since the decline,” said art adviser
 Mary Hoeveler  before the sale. “The appetite at the very top
seems insatiable. You can name your price.”  Warhol’s Coke painting was sold last night by curator and
artist Elizabeth Richebourg Rea, who acquired the piece for
$143,000 at Christie’s in 1983. Titled “Coca-Cola [4][Large
Coca-Cola],” it mimics a soft-drink advertisement Warhol found
in Pittsburgh’s Byzantine Catholic World newspaper for the
Quaker State Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Warhol made four paintings
of Coke bottles, one of which belongs to the  Andy Warhol Museum 
in Pittsburgh, the artist’s hometown.  Warhol’s cobalt blue 1986 “Last Supper,” based on
Leonardo da Vinci’s version, fetched $6.8 million, topping the
$6 million estimate. The seller was Stuttgart-based collector
Josef Froehlich, who acquired the work for $178,500 in 1994,
dealers said.  Lichtenstein Soda  Warhol wasn’t the only pop artist hawking sugary beverages.
 Roy Lichtenstein ’s 1962 “Ice Cream Soda,” sold for $14.1
million, near the bottom end of its $12 million-to-$18 million
estimate range.  An ethereal yellow 1955 work by  Mark Rothko , a stalwart of
previous Sotheby’s sales, sold for $22.5 million on a single
phone bid to an Asian buyer, the auction house said.  The seller was Boston-based architect  Graham Gund , who
acquired the Rothko in 1969, according to a catalog of the
artist’s works.  Two canvases by German painter  Gerhard Richter  were among
the night’s priciest. A wall-sized decorative abstract 1992
painting sold for $11.2 million and a 1966 work based on a photo
of sailors fetched $13.2 million from Houston dealer Robert
McClain. The second painting came from Germany’s Stiftung Neues
Museum Weserburg Bremen.  San Francisco dealer  Anthony Meier  snagged one of the
evening’s most sought-after lots:  Louise Bourgeois ’ spindly
“Spider III,” a 33-inch tall bronze that went for $3.6 million
-- demolishing an $800,000 estimate. Bourgeois, famous for her
towering outdoor spider sculptures, died earlier this year.  “It was something my client was very passionate about,”
Meier said.  Sotheby’s charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer price up
to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1 million, and 12
percent above $1 million.  To contact the reporters on the story:
