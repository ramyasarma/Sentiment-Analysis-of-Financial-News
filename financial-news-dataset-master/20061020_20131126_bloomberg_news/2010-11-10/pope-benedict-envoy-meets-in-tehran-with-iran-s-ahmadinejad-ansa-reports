An envoy of Pope Benedict XVI met
with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran and
delivered a message from the Roman Catholic leader, Italian news
agency Ansa said today, citing Iranian media reports.  Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, who heads the Vatican’s office
on inter-religious dialogue, met with Ahmadinejad yesterday,
Ansa said. The Vatican said this week that Tauran was traveling
to Iran to take part in inter-religious talks that would include
a visit to the city of Qom, a Shiite spiritual center where the
Iranian government has said it is building a uranian-enrichment
facility.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
