France Telecom SA  is planning to
introduce a series of low-cost offers under its Orange brand in
a bid to double its sales in rural Africa by 2015 from 3.4
billion euros ($4.7 billion) in 2009, the Financial Times
reported.  The company’s strategy will rely on organic growth rather
than large-scale acquisitions, the newspaper said. “Orange
wants to be the champion of rural Africa,” France Telecom
executive director for Africa, the Middle East and Asia,  Mark Rennard  said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
