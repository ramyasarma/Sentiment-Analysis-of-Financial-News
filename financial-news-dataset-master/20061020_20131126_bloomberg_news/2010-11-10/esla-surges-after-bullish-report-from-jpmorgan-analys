Tesla Motors Inc. , the U.S.
electric-carmaker backed by  Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Daimler AG ,
rose 19  percent in Nasdaq trading after a JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst said he was “bullish” on the company’s outlook.  Tesla climbed $4.73 to $29.36 at 4:30 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading, the highest closing price since the shares began
trading on June 29. Tesla has risen 73 percent since its June 28
initial public offering.  “We are bullish on TSLA as we believe it is at the
vanguard of improving battery costs/durability,”  Himanshu Patel , an analyst with JPMorgan, wrote in a report today.  The company, based in Palo Alto, California, should be able
to produce “a well-received Tesla-badged product lineup in this
decade, but also what seems like an increasingly viable
powertrain supply revenue stream,” Patel said in the report,
reiterating his “overweight” recommendation on the shares.  The company yesterday reported a third-quarter  net loss  of
$34.9 million as sales declined and it spent money to develop a
battery-powered sedan.  Along with Toyota and Daimler, which have each invested
about $50 million in Tesla, Japan’s  Panasonic Corp.  last week
bought a $30 million stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
