China’s stock market may benefit
from quantitative easing as excess liquidity flows into
equities, according to Michael Kurtz, head of Asian strategy at
Macquarie Bank Ltd.  The U.S. government debt-buying plan to boost its economy,
dubbed quantitative easing, “creates challenges for China,”
he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Still, some
of this liquidity may be diverted to the nation’s A-share
market, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
