Angola , Africa’s second-biggest oil
producer, cut its benchmark rediscount rate by five percentage
points, a month after the appointment of a new governor of the
southern African nation’s central bank.  The rate that the central bank charges commercial lenders
to borrow money was lowered to 25 percent from 30 percent, the
Luanda-based  National Bank of Angola  said on its website today.
It didn’t provide reasons for the cut, which reverses a similar
increase in September 2009.  Last month, Angolan President  Jose Eduardo  dos Santos
appointed Jose de Lima Massano as governor of the central bank,
replacing  Abraao Gourgel , who was named head of a newly created
economy ministry.  Laura Maria Alcantara Monteiro  was also fired
as deputy central bank governor last month.  Inflation in Angola jumped to 15.7 percent in September
after the government increased gasoline prices by 50 percent,
according to the National Statistics Institute. The rate had
remained between 13.5 percent and 14 percent for the past year
before last month’s increase.  The kwanza traded at 92.503 per dollar on Nov. 8, compared
with 92.505 on Nov. 5, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
