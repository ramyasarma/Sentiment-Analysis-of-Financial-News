Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. , the world’s largest lender by market value, plans to
raise 45 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) in a  rights offer  to
replenish capital depleted by credit growth.  The bank will sell 11.29 billion shares in Shanghai at 2.99
yuan each and 3.74 billion shares in Hong Kong at the equivalent
price in Hong Kong dollars, according to a statement to the
Shanghai stock exchange. Investors will be entitled to 0.45
share for every 10 held.  Beijing-based ICBC is competing for investors’ cash with
smaller rivals  China Construction Bank Corp.  and  Bank of China
Ltd. , which are seeking a combined $18 billion in share sales as
they brace for stricter capital rules and aim to maintain profit
growth in the next three years.  Shares of ICBC dropped 1.9 percent in Hong Kong and lost
0.8 percent in Shanghai today before the announcement. The stock
has risen 3 percent this year in Hong Kong, underperforming the
12 percent gain in the  Hang Seng Index .  ICBC’s offer price represents a 37 percent discount to the
closing value of its yuan-denominated A shares and 47 percent to
Hong Kong-traded shares. Construction Bank, the nation’s second
largest by assets, granted investors a discount of 27 percent in
Shanghai and 43 percent in Hong Kong in its 61.7 billion yuan
rights offer announced earlier this month.  ICBC on Oct. 28 reported a 27 percent gain in  third-quarter
profit , driven by a 14.7 percent increase in lending in the
first nine months of 2010, helping it stay on course to be the
world’s most  profitable bank  for a third year.  Bank ‘Road Map’  Its capital adequacy ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, stood at 11.57 percent on Sept. 30, meeting the 11.5
percent mandatory minimum. The China Banking Regulatory
Commission said in September it will publish the nation’s own
“framework and road map” for banks’ capital requirements this
year, in line with so-called Basel III global rules.  China’s Ministry of Finance and Central Huijin Investment
Ltd., which own a combined 70.7 percent of ICBC, have  agreed  to
take part in the offer.  ICBC’s sale brings the amount China’s five largest banks
are raising this year to more than $60 billion after a record
$1.4 trillion in  lending  last year strained capital levels. The
Chinese bank  completed the sale of 25 billion yuan of
convertible bonds in September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
