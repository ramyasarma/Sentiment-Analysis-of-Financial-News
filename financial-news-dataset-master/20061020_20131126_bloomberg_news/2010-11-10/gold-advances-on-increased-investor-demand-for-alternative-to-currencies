Gold climbed in London on demand for
an alternative investment to currencies. Silver and palladium
advanced.  Gold reached a record $1,424.60 an ounce yesterday on
concern debt-stricken nations in Europe will struggle to repay
bondholders and spending cuts will stifle growth in the region.
Precious metals are rallying as the U.S. Federal Reserve buys
more debt to keep the economic recovery from flagging. CME Group
Inc.’s Comex unit yesterday raised margin requirements for
silver futures.  “People are still worried” about Europe and the U.S.,
said  Bernard Sin , head of currency and metal trading at bullion
refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. “Markets are still very
concerned about quantitative easing. That’s why the trend for
gold is still holding up.”  Immediate-delivery bullion added $6.50, or 0.5 percent, to
$1,399.40 an ounce at 8:32 a.m. New York time. The metal for
December delivery was 0.8 percent lower at $1,398.60 on the
Comex in New York, after yesterday reaching a record $1,424.30.
Futures jumped before closing yesterday.  Futures settled at $1,410.10 on the Comex yesterday, a gain
of about 1.2 percent from a trade of $1,392.80 four seconds
earlier, exchange data on Bloomberg show. Prices opened at
$1,392.90 today. Silver, platinum and palladium futures in New
York also jumped before closing yesterday.  Bullion fell to $1,402 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,421 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Additional Purchases  Gold is up 27 percent this year and is heading for a 10th
annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in
London, partly on demand for an alternative asset to protect
against the debasement of currencies. Governments have spent
trillions of dollars to bolster their economies. Last week, the
Fed said it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries
through June.  “Paper money is being printed and printed, but there’s no
other alternative,” said C.S. Oh, head of the overseas futures
team at NH Investment & Futures Co. in Seoul. “There’s no
change to the fundamentals in the gold market. The dollar looks
a bit stronger now, but it’s poised to weaken in the long
term.”  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 1.5 metric
tons to 2,088.68 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. Silver assets climbed 118.4 tons to 14,387.4
tons yesterday, the most since at least February, data from four
providers show.  Margin Requirements  Silver for immediate delivery in London climbed 2.5 percent
to $27.595 an ounce after yesterday reaching $29.36, the highest
price since March 1980. The metal is up 63 percent this year.
Silver reached an all-time high of $50.35 in New York in 1980, a
year after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  The minimum amount of cash that traders must deposit when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will rise to
$6,500 per contract from $5,000 for Comex exchange members,
 Michael Shore , a Chicago-based spokesman for the exchange, said
yesterday.  Palladium gained 1.1 percent to $700 an ounce and
yesterday reached a nine-year high of $743. It’s up 72 percent
this year. Platinum was little changed at $1,760 an ounce.
Prices reached $1,808.50 yesterday, the highest level since July
2008. Both metals are used mostly to make jewelry and pollution-
control devices for cars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
