Efforts by the U.S. Federal Reserve
to boost liquidity to help the domestic economy are going to
have an “important” impact on its southern neighbor, Mexico
Central bank President Agustin Carstens said.  It will “take time” for the U.S. to reduce its leveraging
and the country’s policy tools are limited, Carstens said today
at the Bloomberg Mexico Economic Summit in Mexico City. U.S.
growth will be slower, he said, without providing a forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
