U.S. stock futures pared losses
after better-than-forecast data on jobless claims and the trade
balance.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent at 8:34 a.m. in New York, trimming a decline of as much
as 0.2 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also pared
losses to 0.1 percent from 0.2 percent.  The number of Americans filing initial jobless claims last
week fell to the lowest level in four months, reinforcing
evidence the U.S. labor market is healing.  Applications for jobless benefits declined by 24,000 to
435,000 in the week ended Nov. 6, lower than the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The total number of people collecting
unemployment insurance fell to the lowest level since November
2008, and those receiving extended payments also declined.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
