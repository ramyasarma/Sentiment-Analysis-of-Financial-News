Mexico would consider measures to
curb gains in the peso if the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stimulus
plan accelerates capital flows into the country, central bank
President  Agustin Carstens  said.  Carstens, at the Bloomberg  Economic Summit  in Mexico City
today, said policy makers will be “very patient” before taking
any action. He said they would coordinate any currency measures
with the finance ministry to avoid sending the “wrong signal”
to investors.  Right now the peso, whose 1.8 percent rally over the past
month is the biggest in Latin America, is not overvalued,
Carstens said. The peso’s 7 percent rally this year is the 
second-best in the region after Colombia’s peso.  “Mexico has to be careful for the medium and long-term
consequences of any actions to deal with a stronger peso,”
Carstens said. He said capital controls like those adopted by
Brazil are unlikely to be effective in the long-run.  Bond yields have declined to “extraordinarily” low
levels, he said. Policy makers are watching “closely” the
decline in yields to see whether they are transitory or not.  Carstens said Mexico would benefit if the Fed’s decision 
to purchase $600 billion in Treasuries succeeds in boosting 
U.S. economic growth. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports
to the U.S.  “It’s an understandable measure, and up to some point
even desirable,” he said.  “If I were in Ben Bernanke’s 
shoes I would do the same.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
