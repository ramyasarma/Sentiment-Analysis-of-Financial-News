Vivo Participacoes SA , Brazil’s
biggest wireless carrier by market share, said third-quarter
profit rose 81 percent after it increased subscribers and data
contracts, and lowered financial expenses.  Net income advanced to 601.8 million reais ($353 million)
from 332.7 million reais a year earlier, Vivo said today in a
regulatory filing. Net operating sales increased 10 percent to
4.61 billion reais. The  average estimate  for profit excluding
some items was 366.1 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  Vivo ended the quarter with 57.7 million clients, an
increase of 18 percent from a year earlier. The Sao Paulo-based
company’s share of the Brazilian mobile-phone market rose to
30.1 percent in September from 29.4 percent a year earlier,
according to telecommunications regulator Anatel. The market
expanded by 15 percent in that period.  “Vivo has been successful in capturing a greater share of
post-paid customers, attracted by the company’s competitive
offers with a focus on data,” analysts at  Ativa Corretora  wrote
in a Nov. 9 report to clients.  Vivo’s net financial expenses fell to 63.5 million reais in
the quarter from 98 million reais a year earlier, the company
said. The decrease was helped by reduced debt after a payment to
Anatel for 3G licenses, and by lower debt-service costs, Vivo
said. Depreciation and amortization expenses fell 30 percent in
the quarter.  Telefonica  Spain’s  Telefonica SA  bought  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA ’s
stake in the venture that controls Vivo for 7.5 billion euros
($10.3 billion) in July. Telefonica plans to combine
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA , its Brazilian fixed-line unit,
with Vivo to form the largest telecommunications operator in the
country.  Vivo’s preferred shares rose 1.5 percent to 51.21 reais in
Sao Paulo yesterday. The stock has fallen 6 percent this year,
 compared with  a 4.5 percent rise in the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
