The  Australian Competition &
Consumer Commission  will review a planned takeover of ASX Ltd.,
operator of the country’s bourse, by Singapore Exchange Ltd.  The review will scrutinize the deal’s impact on “the
development of competition between exchanges and associated
products or services,” the ACCC said in an announcement on its
website.  Potential impacts on entry to the Australian marketplace by
Chi-X Australia and other operators will also be evaluated as
part of the review, the announcement said.  “This is an anticipated part of the regulatory process,”
said  Magdalyn Liew , a spokeswoman for Singapore Exchange. “We
will extend full cooperation and necessary information to ACCC
in relation to the proposed merger.”  On Oct. 25, Singapore Exchange offered to buy Australia’s
ASX Ltd. for A$8.4 billion ($8.4 billion) in a cash and share
deal that would create the world’s fifth-largest listed exchange
company.  The bid faces scrutiny from the Foreign Investment Review
Board, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said
on Oct 27. Australian lawmakers including Greens party leader
Bob Brown have said they will block the proposed merger as it
raises national interest concerns.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
