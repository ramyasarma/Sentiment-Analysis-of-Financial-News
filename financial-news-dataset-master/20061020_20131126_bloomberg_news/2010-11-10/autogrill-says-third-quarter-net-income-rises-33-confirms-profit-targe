Autogrill SpA , the world’s biggest
manager of airport and highway restaurants, said third-quarter
profit rose 33 percent amid a recovery in the travel industry.
The company confirmed its full-year profit forecasts.  Net income rose to 93.4 million euros ($129 million) from
70 million euros a year earlier, the Rozzano, Italy-based
company said today in a stock-exchange statement. That beat the
81.7 million-euro average  estimate  of three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  Autogrill said the recovery in air passenger traffic in the
third quarter was “marked,” particularly in business-class
customers. Tourist arrivals worldwide may rise 5 percent this
year, reversing a 5 percent decline in 2009 after companies cut
travel budgets and fewer people took holidays in the recession,
Euromonitor International said in a Nov. 8 report.  The company cited a “gradual recovery in traffic that
seems to be consolidating” since September, Chief Executive
Officer  Gianmario Tondato Da Ruos  said in the statement.  Third-quarter sales rose 10 percent to 1.63 billion euros,
in line with the average estimate of 10 analysts for 1.62
billion euros.  Autogrill  rose 0.6 percent to 9.805 euros at 1:15 p.m. in
Milan trading, giving the company a market value of 2.49 billion
euros. The stock has advanced almost 11 percent this year.  Autogrill confirmed a full-year revenue forecast of 5.6
billion euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 590 million euros. The company first gave
the forecasts on Oct. 8, when it announced the sale of its Alpha
Flight catering unit in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
