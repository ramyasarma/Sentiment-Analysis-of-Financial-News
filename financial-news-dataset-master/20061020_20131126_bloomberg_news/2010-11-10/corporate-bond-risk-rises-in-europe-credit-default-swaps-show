The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 17 basis
points to 453, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 4:01 p.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals a deterioration in
the perception of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 4.25 basis points to 103. The cost
of protecting bank bonds from default also rose, with the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers up 7 at 144 and the subordinated index 13 higher at
224, the highest since June.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
