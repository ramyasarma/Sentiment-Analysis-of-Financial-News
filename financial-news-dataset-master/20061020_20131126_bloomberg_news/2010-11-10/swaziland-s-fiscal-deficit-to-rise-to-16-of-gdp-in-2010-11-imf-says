Swaziland’s fiscal deficit is
expected to widen to 16 percent in the 2010-11 financial year
from 7.1 percent in the 2009-2010 year, the International
Monetary Fund said on its website today.  The widening of the deficit is due to a fall in revenue
from the Southern African Customs Union and a 4.5 percent pay
increase granted to civil servants and politicians, the IMF
said.  Economic growth will accelerate to 2 percent in 2010, the
IMF said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
