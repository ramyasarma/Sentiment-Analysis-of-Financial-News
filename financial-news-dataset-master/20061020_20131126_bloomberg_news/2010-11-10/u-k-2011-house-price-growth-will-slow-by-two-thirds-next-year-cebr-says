U.K. house-price growth in 2011 will
slow to a third of the increase forecast for this year, the
Centre for Economics and Business Research said.  Home values will rise 2.2 percent next year to an average
183,349 pounds ($296,500), compared with a predicted gain of 6.9
in 2010, the London-based group said in an e-mailed report
today. Property prices will rise by 16 percent in the next four
years, the report said.  The Bank of England last week kept its bond purchase plan
unchanged at 200 billion pounds after the economy grew twice as
much as economists forecast in the third quarter. Some officials
have argued that the biggest budget squeeze since World War II
may hamper the recovery, and the CEBR said it’s “highly
likely” the central bank will expand stimulus.  “House prices may not move much during 2011 but they are
likely to rise significantly in the following three years,”
CEBR Chief Executive Officer  Douglas McWilliams  said in the
statement. Still, “ quantitative easing  is a very powerful
medicine and is likely to have a strong impact on the housing
market eventually.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
