Bank Pekao SA , the unit of UniCredit
SpA that’s Poland’s second-largest bank, said third-quarter
profit rose 6.3 percent as revenue from lending increased.  Net income climbed to 659.7 million zloty ($233 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 620.5 million zloty in the
year-earlier period, the Warsaw-based bank said in a statement
today. That beat the 644.5 billion-zloty  average estimate  of 12
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Pekao is benefiting from accelerating growth in Poland
after the economy expanded at a faster-than-estimated 3.5
percent in the second quarter. It’s forecast to grow at the same
pace for the full year, according to the country’s central bank.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, rose 6.8 percent
to 1.05 billion zloty in the third quarter. At the same time,
fees were little changed at 590.6 million zloty, Pekao said.
Total lending advanced 6.4 percent to 30.5 billion zloty from
the end of last year, according to the statement.  Pekao shares rose 2.1 percent to 196.5 zloty yesterday,
valuing the bank at about 51.5 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
