Oman plans to produce 1 million
barrels of oil a day in the next five years, the country’s oil
minister said.  “We will be disappointed if we fail to achieve the target
of producing 1 million barrels of oil per day,”  Mohammed Bin Hamed al-Rumhy  said today in an interview in Muscat.  The government is planning to start production from new
fields, including Hubhub, which will boost output, he said.  Oman aims to raise its daily production to 850,000 barrels
a day this year, al-Rumhy said in May. Oman crude and condensate
output climbed to 870,800 barrels a day in July, 3.3 percent
more than the previous month, the ministry of economy said in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
