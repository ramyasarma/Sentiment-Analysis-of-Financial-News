involved in a tough debate regarding the austerity program
needed to rein in the budget deficit.”  RBS Declines  RBS , Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, slumped 2.7

world’s biggest maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters
declined to upgrade its forecast for a fourth time in 2010.  “The sector wants upgrades to justify the recent strong
performance and in the absence of any upgrade, the shares have
continued to roll over,” Altium Capital Ltd. analyst  Steve Medlicott  said by telephone.  BT, Antofagasta Rise  BT gained 6.1 percent to 169.1 pence. Earnings before
