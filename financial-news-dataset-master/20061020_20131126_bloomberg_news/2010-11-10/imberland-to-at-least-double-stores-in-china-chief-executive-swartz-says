Timberland Co.  plans to at least
double stores selling its products in China by the end of 2011,
as the U.S.-based maker of waterproof boots seeks to benefit
from rising incomes in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Timberland will also invest in its Hong Kong shops, Chief
Executive Officer  Jeffrey Swartz  said in an interview in the
Chinese city. The Stratham, New Hampshire-based company sells
products through 110 stores in China.  Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd., Trinity Ltd., Salvatore
Ferragamo SpA and other retailers are all expanding in China,
where sales nationwide have jumped 18.3 percent in the first
nine months of the year. Labor costs have also advanced, forcing
companies to offer more wages to retain skilled labor.  “We’re seeing rapid evolution in the Chinese market,”
said Swartz. “Labor is much less available and this puts real
pressure on input costs.”  Timberland manufactures its shoes in factories in China,
Vietnam, Thailand, and the Dominican Republic, Swartz said. It
will soon open a factory in Haiti, he said.  The company is recycling waste to reduce the costs of its
materials, Swartz said. Asia accounted for 11.4 percent of
Timberland’s sales last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
