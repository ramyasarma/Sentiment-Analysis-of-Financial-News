German imports are expected to rise
13.3 percent this year as consumers step up spending before
slowing to 6.8 percent in 2011, the government’s panel of
economic advisers said.   “Strong domestic consumption not only helps compensate for
insecurities in the export sector, at the same time it
contributes to breaking down international imbalances,” the
panel said in a faxed statement.  The panel expects economic growth to slow to 2.2 percent in
2011 after an export-led boom fuels 3.7 percent growth this
year, the report said. Exports will soar 15.5 percent this year;
ebbing to 6.7 percent next year.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
