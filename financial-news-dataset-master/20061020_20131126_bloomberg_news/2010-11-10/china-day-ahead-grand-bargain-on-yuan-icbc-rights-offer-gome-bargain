China is accelerating the
yuan’s appreciation as part of the “grand bargain” to win
U.S. support for Beijing to gain a bigger say at the
International Monetary Fund, says Goldman Sachs Asset
Management’s  Jim O’Neill .  China’s yuan, as known as the renminbi, reached the
strongest level against the dollar since 1993 ahead of a
Group of 20 leaders meeting this week in Seoul. The gain
came after the IMF’s executive board approved a plan that
would make China the third-strongest member in the
organization, a position described by the fund’s chief
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn  as allowing Beijing to take more
“responsibility” in the global economy.  “People forget, but the currency has risen by 3
percent since the summer and has risen nearly 25 percent
over five years,” said O’Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs
Asset, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. It’s not a
“fluke” that China is given a bigger share at the
Washington-based IMF, and “that’s part of the grand
bargain,” he said.  ICBC Rights Offer  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the
world’s largest lender by market value, plans to raise 45
billion yuan ($6.8 billion) in a rights offer to replenish
capital depleted by credit growth.  The bank will sell 11.29 billion shares in Shanghai at
2.99 yuan each and 3.74 billion shares in Hong Kong at the
equivalent price in Hong Kong dollars, according to a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. Investors will be
entitled to 0.45 share for every 10 held.  Reserve Ratio  China’s central bank raised lenders’ reserve
requirements as cash from October’s larger-than-forecast
$27.1 billion  trade surplus  threatened to add to the risk
of asset bubbles and accelerating inflation.  Reserve requirements will increase 0.5 percentage
points from Nov. 16, the People’s Bank of China said in a
 statement  on its website about eight hours after the trade
data. The announcement followed media reports of increases
for selected banks.  Geithner on G-20  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he
believes the  Group of 20 nations  can overcome tensions over
a proposed framework on trade balances, after recent
critical comments from officials in nations including
Germany and China.  “I think it overstates the level of disagreement
about the challenges we have ahead,” Geithner told
reporters en route from Singapore to Seoul for the G-20
leaders’ summit. “We expect we’ll see broad support for
the type of cooperative framework the ministers of finance
first introduced two weeks ago.”  Tencent Earnings  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , China’s biggest Internet
company by market value, said third-quarter profit rose 52
percent as sales of online games and advertising revenue
surged.  Net income  climbed to 2.15 billion yuan ($325 million)
from 1.42 billion yuan a year earlier, Tencent said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. This compares
with the 2.16 billion yuan average of 11 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese Insurers in Canada  Chinese insurance companies will be allowed to invest
in Canada through their wealth management operations,
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said.  The agreement with China gives Canadian financial
markets access to a pool of up to C$106 billion ($106
billion), Flaherty said in a statement from Seoul, South
Korea.  Huaneng Alternative Energy IPO  China Huaneng Group Corp. , the nation’s largest
electricity producer, applied for an initial public
offering for its alternative energy unit in Hong Kong,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Huaneng unit has hired  Morgan Stanley ,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  and  Macquarie Group Ltd.  to manage the $1
billion sale, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Gome, Huang Strike Deal  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. , China’s
second-biggest electronics retailer, and a company
controlled by founder  Huang Guangyu  said they agreed to
appoint Huang’s representatives to the board.  Zou Xiaochun, Huang’s corporate lawyer, will join
Gome’s board as an executive director and Huang Yanhong,
Huang’s sister, will join as a non-executive director, for
three-year terms, Gome said in a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday evening. The board will expand to 13
 directors  from 11, it said. The agreement is subject to a
shareholders’ vote.  MARKETS  U.S.  stocks  advanced, ending two days of declines, as
a rally in oil prices boosted energy shares and Ireland’s
central bank governor said the country may return to bond
markets next year, easing concern that Europe’s debt crisis
will worsen.  Chevron Corp. gained 1.9 percent as oil reached a two-
year high following an Energy Department report showing an
unexpected decrease in crude stockpiles. Bank of America
Corp. rose 2.4 percent, leading financial shares higher.
Ford Motor Co. rallied 3.5 percent as the automaker held
its lead as the top-earning car manufacturer. Boeing Co.
slid 3.2 percent, weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, after suspending test flights of the 787
Dreamliner jet.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.4 percent
to 1,218.71 at 4:17 p.m. in New York, recovering from a 0.8
percent loss. The  Dow  climbed 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 11,357.04. Benchmark indexes reached two-yeah highs last
week after the Federal Reserve expanded its program of
asset purchases to stimulate growth, a tactic known as
quantitative easing.  After the market closed, U.S. stock futures fell,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may erase
yesterday’s gain, after Cisco Systems Inc. projected less
profit than analysts estimated.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Banking stocks: China’s central bank will increase the
