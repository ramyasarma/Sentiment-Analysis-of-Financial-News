Chinese central bank adviser Xia Bin
said the nation should tax inflows of short-term capital and
send a clear signal that speculators bringing hot money into the
country will be punished.  Developing nations should strengthen capital controls after
the U.S. decision to undertake so-called quantitative easing,
Xia told reporters today at a forum in Beijing.  China doesn’t welcome foreign speculators in the nation’s
commercial real estate market, Xia said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
