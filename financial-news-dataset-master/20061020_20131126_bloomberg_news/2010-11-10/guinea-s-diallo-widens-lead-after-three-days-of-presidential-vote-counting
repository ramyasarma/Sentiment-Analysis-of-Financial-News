Guinea’s  Cellou Dalein Diallo , a
former prime minister of the West African nation, widened his
lead after three days of counting ballots cast in the Nov. 7
presidential election.  Diallo had 59.6 percent of the votes counted in 15 of the
country’s 38 electoral districts and 10 overseas embassies,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on data provided by
Pathe Dieng, a spokesman for the electoral commission, in
Conakry today. Opposition leader  Alpha Conde  polled 40.4
percent.  The election is  Guinea’s  first democratic transfer of power
since it won independence from France in 1958. It comes almost
two years after the army seized power following the December
2008 death of President  Lansana Conte , who ruled the world’s
biggest bauxite exporter for 24 years.  “While this is one step in a long and complex process, a
strong foundation is being laid for a sustainable democracy,”
the Atlanta-based Carter Center’s election observation mission
said in a  statement  published on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
