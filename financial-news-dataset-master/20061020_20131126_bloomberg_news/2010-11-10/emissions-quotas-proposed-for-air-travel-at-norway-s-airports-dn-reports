Norway’s Minister of Environment and
International Development Erik Solheim is submitting a proposal
to introduce emission quotas for air travel at Norwegian
airports as of 2012, Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing the
minister.  The quotas could increase ticket prices by as much as 320
kroner ($55) as of 2012, the Oslo-based newspaper
reported. Solheim also wants to cap emissions from air traffic
at current levels, Dagens Naeringsliv said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
