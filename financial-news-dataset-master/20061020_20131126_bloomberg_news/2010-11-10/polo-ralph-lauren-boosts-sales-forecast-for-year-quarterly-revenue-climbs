Polo Ralph Lauren Corp ., the New
York-based seller of the namesake brand clothing, raised its
sales projection for the year as customers snapped up footwear
and apparel.  Sales will increase at “a low double-digit” rate, the
company said today in a statement. In August, the company
projected a “mid-to-high single-digit” rate.  Net income  in the
quarter ended Oct. 2 climbed 16 percent to $205.2 million, or
$2.09 a share, from $177.5 million, or $1.75, a year earlier.  Revenue climbed 11 percent to $1.53 billion, fueled by the
wholesale business in the U.S. and Europe. Consumers are
beginning to spend again as they recover from the worst economic
slump in about 70 years. Ralph Lauren, led by its namesake chief
executive officer, gets about 70 percent of sales from North
America.  Polo Ralph Lauren surged $7.36, or 7.3 percent, to $108.28
at 4 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
making it the biggest gainer in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
The increase was the largest in three months.  Analysts on average projected quarterly profit of $1.69 a
share on sales of $1.49 billion, according to estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
