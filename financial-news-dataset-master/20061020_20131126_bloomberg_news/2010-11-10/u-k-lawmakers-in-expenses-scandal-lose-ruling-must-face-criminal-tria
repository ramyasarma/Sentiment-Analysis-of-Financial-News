Three former lawmakers accused of
filing improper expense claims must face a normal criminal
trial, the U.K.’s highest court ruled.  Judges at the Supreme Court in London today rejected claims
made by former Labour party members of parliament  Elliot Morley ,
 David Chaytor  and  Jim Devine  that they are protected by
“Parliamentary Privilege.”  President of the Supreme Court Nicholas Phillips made the
ruling today, without indicating how the nine-judge panel voted.
The court has said it will give its reasoning for the ruling at
a later date.  U.K. prosecutors in February charged the men over falsely
accounting for their expenses while serving in Parliament. Two
lower courts have previously ruled they should be tried in a
criminal court.  Nigel Pleming, a lawyer for the men, told the Supreme Court
last month the lawmakers don’t claim to be above the law. He
said they brought the case to determine the correct venue for a
trial, and that they should be tried by Parliament itself.  The case is: R v. Chaytor & Others (Appellants).  To contact the reporter on this story:
