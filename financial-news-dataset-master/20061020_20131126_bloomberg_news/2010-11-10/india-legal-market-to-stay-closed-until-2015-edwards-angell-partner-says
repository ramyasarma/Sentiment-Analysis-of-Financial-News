India’s legal market won’t open for
at least five years, according to a lawyer who went to the
country with a delegation of business leaders in conjunction
with U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s visit.  The subject was dropped from the agenda of Obama’s talks
with the Indian government said Shahana Basu Kanodia, a partner
and chair of the South Asia practice group of Boston law firm
Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge LLP, who said she was involved in
preparations for the meetings  India prohibits foreign lawyers from practicing law or
setting up offices in the country. The ban was upheld in
December by the Bombay High Court in a ruling that said Ashurst
LLP, Chadbourne & Parke LLP and White & Case LLP shouldn’t have
been licensed by India’s central bank to open offices.
Liberalization would take “five, six, or seven years,” after
that ruling, Kanodia said.  Indian businesses don’t see many advantages to foreign law
firms entering, she said.  Obama said his three-day visit to India yielded agreements
that will support thousands of U.S. jobs and spur trade in high-
technology goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
