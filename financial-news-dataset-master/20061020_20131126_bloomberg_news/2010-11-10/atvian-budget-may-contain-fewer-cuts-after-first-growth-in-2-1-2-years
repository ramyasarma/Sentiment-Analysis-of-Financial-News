Latvia’s 2011 budget may contain
fewer deficit-cutting measures after the  economy  saw its first
annual growth in 2 1/2 years, Prime Minister  Valdis Dombrovskis 
said today.  The austerity package “could be smaller than previously
planned,” Dombrovskis said on Latvian Independent Television’s
900 Seconds. The government previously agreed to a mix of
spending cuts and tax increases totaling 350 million lati ($679
million) to 395 million lati, he said.  The size of budget cuts will be known Nov. 12, and the
government will discuss the budget with a visiting mission from
the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund,
Dombrobskis said. The Baltic country turned to a group led by
the EU and IMF for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.3 billion) loan after
its second biggest bank needed a state rescue in late 2008.  Latvian gross domestic product grew 2.7 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, the first annual expansion in 10
quarters, the  central statistics office  in Riga reported
yesterday, citing preliminary data.  The economic contraction for all of 2010 “may be close to
zero,” Finance Minister  Andris Vilks  said yesterday, according
to the  Baltic News Service . The government is well positioned to
improve its credit rating within about six months, Vilks said,
according to the Riga-based newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
