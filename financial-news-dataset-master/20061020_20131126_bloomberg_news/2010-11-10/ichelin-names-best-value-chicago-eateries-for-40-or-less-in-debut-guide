The first  Michelin  guide to Chicago
identifies 46 eateries as offering value for money, honoring 20
types of cuisine, from barbecue to Thai food, Polish to Chinese.  The winners of stars will be announced on Nov. 17 and
Michelin gives a preview today by naming good restaurants that
offer two courses and a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or
less. The total of 46 compares with 95 for New York.  “The inspectors found an excellent and diverse selection
of restaurants meeting the criteria for the Bib Gourmand across
the city and in a few of the closer suburbs,” Michelin said in
an e-mailed release. “Bib Gourmands are spots where they send
their friends and families and represent the diversity and
creativity found in the Chicago restaurant scene.”  Michelin & Cie., based in Clermont Ferrand, France, is the
world’s second-biggest tiremaker. The company produced its first
so-called Red Guide at the turn of the 20th century to encourage
motoring. In the U.S., the company also publishes guides to New
York and San Francisco. The Chicago inspectors are all
Americans, Michelin said.  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
