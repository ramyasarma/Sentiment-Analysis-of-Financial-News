More buildings in  Pompeii  may
collapse after the Domus Gladiatoria, the Roman gymnasium for
gladiators, crumbled on Nov. 6 in the ancient city southeast of
Naples, Italian Culture Minister  Sandro Bondi  said.  “More collapses may occur,” Bondi told Italy’s lower
house of parliament today in Rome. “Problems affecting Pompeii
and other issues regarding our cultural heritage have been going
on for decades without anyone being able to fix them or plan an
effective strategy.”  Bondi was asked to testify after the opposition called for
him to resign and accused the government of cutting funding for
heritage sites. Pompeii was destroyed in 79 A.D. when Mount
Vesuvius erupted, killing thousands of people and burying the
city in volcanic ash. In July 2008, Italy declared a state of
emergency to protect the buried ancient city, naming a special
commissioner to oversee its preservation and management.  Bondi said he won’t resign and denied that the collapse was
due to a lack of financing of the archeological site. He said
better management of financial resources is needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
