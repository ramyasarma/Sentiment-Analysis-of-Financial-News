Nigeria’s  labor unions called off a
one-day general strike over the minimum wage in Africa’s top oil
producer after the groups said President  Goodluck Jonathan 
pledged to boost the rate.  The strike, initially planned to last three days, was
halted to give Jonathan time to “act on his promise,”  John Odah ,
secretary general of the Nigeria Labor Congress, an umbrella of
unions, said in a phone interview today from Abuja.  Jonathan asked the labor groups to “embrace continued
dialogue on the issue,” Ima Niboro, the presidential spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. It did not say whether
Jonathan made a new wage offer. Calls made to Niboro’s mobile
phone today did not connect.  The unions are demanding a minimum monthly wage of 52,000
naira ($346), from the current 9,500 naira. A government
committee recommended an increase to 18,000 naira ($120) in
July, union officials say.  The leaders will meet again in early December to consider
any new wage offers made by the government, Odah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
