A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S , the owner
of the world’s largest container-shipping line, lifted its 2010
forecast for a third time in four months on higher freight rates
and predicted that the market will expand next year.  Net income before minority interests will reach $5 billion
this year, the Copenhagen-based company said today. That
compared with an August projection of more than $4 billion.
Third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes almost tripled
to 17 billion kroner ($3.1 billion), beating the 14.5 billion-
krone average  estimate  of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Maersk rose as much as 2.7 percent in Copenhagen. The
company is recovering from its first  annual net loss  in at least
half a century after the shipping market contracted in 2009 for
the first time since containers became the world’s standard
means of carrying freight in the 1970s. Freight rates in the
third quarter were higher than anticipated and the container
market will grow by 6 percent in 2011, Chief Executive Officer
 Nils Smedegaard Andersen  said.  “We’re very optimistic in the longer term on the container
business and also expect growth in 2011,” Andersen said in a
telephone interview from Copenhagen.  Cost Management  Maersk  climbed  as much as 1,310 kroner and was up 540
kroner, or 1.1 percent, to 49,830 kroner as of 11:27 a.m. in
Copenhagen. Before today, the shares had gained 35 percent this
year, compared with an 8.4 percent advance in the  Bloomberg
European 500 Index .  “Maersk has managed to successfully turn an
underperforming container division into a very profitable unit,
with costs well under control,”  Axel Funhoff , an analyst at ING
Equity Research in Brussels who advises buying the shares, write
in a note. “There is a good chance that in the medium term, the
container shipping industry remains disciplined with respect to
capacity and price management.”  Third-quarter net income before minority interests was 9.62
billion kroner, compared with a loss of 838 million kroner a
year earlier. Sales gained 24 percent to 81.2 billion kroner.  Hanjin Shipping Co. , South Korea’s biggest container line,
last week reported third-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates.  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. , based in Singapore, said
on Oct. 19 that container volume increased 12 percent in the
three months ended Sept. 17, and posted profit that beat
estimates.  Freight Rates  The global container shipping market will grow by about 7
percent annually in the next five years as “stability” returns
to the industry, London-based Drewry Shipping Consultants said
in an Oct. 11 report.  Maersk’s container activities, which include Maersk Line,
the world’s largest container shipper, generated net income of
$2.25 billion in the first nine months compared with a $1.59
billion loss a year earlier. Maersk transported the equivalent
of 5.4 million 40-foot containers, 7 percent more than in the
same period last year. Rates were 34 percent higher on average
in the nine-month period, the company said.  More than half of the improvement in the net result stemmed
from the cost cuts that Maersk first started in 2008, while the
rest was caused by higher rates, CEO Andersen said.  The company’s oil and gas unit, the Nordic region’s second-
largest explorer after  Statoil ASA , said net income in the nine-
month period rose to $1.34 billion from $958 million a year
earlier. The division was helped by oil prices that were on
average 35 percent higher than in the same period of 2009,
Maersk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
