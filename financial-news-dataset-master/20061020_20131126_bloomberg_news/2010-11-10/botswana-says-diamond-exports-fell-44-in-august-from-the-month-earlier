Diamond exports from Botswana, the
world’s biggest producer of the gems, fell 44 percent in August
from the previous month, the Central Statistics Office said.  The country exported 1.24 billion pula ($190 million) worth
of diamonds in August, resulting in a 35 percent drop in total
exports to 2.12 billion pula, the Gaborone-based agency said
today on its website. Diamond shipments were 90 percent higher
than the same month in 2009.  Total imports fell 18 percent from the previous month to
2.78 billion pula, the agency said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
