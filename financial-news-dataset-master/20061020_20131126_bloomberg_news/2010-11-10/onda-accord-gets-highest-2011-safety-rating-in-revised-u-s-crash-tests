Honda Motor Co. ’s Accord received
the best possible safety rating among 2011 model-year passenger
cars tested for crashes under new U.S. evaluation standards,
edging ahead of Toyota Motor Corp. and  Hyundai Motor Co.  sedans.  The mid-size Accord, Honda’s top-selling U.S. model, got an
overall five-star rating, according to results posted on the U.S.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website.  Of 40 models tested so far, six rated five stars overall.
Accord is the first to get five stars in each of three crash
categories tested by NHTSA.  Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  said last month that
the ratings are aimed at boosting overall safety and ensuring
the results more accurately reflect the crashworthiness of new
cars and light trucks. Changes include the use of female crash-
test dummies for the first time, along with male versions, to
collect data about injuries to the chest, head, neck and legs.  The  2011 Accord sedan  received five stars on side and
frontal crashes and rollovers, according to NHTSA.  Honda rose 0.5 percent to 3,045 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break in Tokyo. The stock has declined 2.1 percent in
2010.  Hyundai’s  Sonata , with an overall five-star rating, got the
top score for side crashes and rollovers and four stars for
frontal crashes, NHTSA said last month. Toyota’s  Camry , the
best-selling U.S. passenger car, rated three stars overall,
earning three for side and frontal crashes and four for
rollovers.  The agency continues to test 2011 model-year cars and
trucks and is adding the results as they are completed. The
results are available at  http://www.safercar.gov.   To contact the reporters on this story:
