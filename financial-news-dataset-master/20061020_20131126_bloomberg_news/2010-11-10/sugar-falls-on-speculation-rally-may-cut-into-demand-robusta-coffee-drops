Raw sugar declined, ending the
longest rally since 2006, on speculation that consumers will
seek cheaper alternatives after prices surged to a 29-year high.
Cocoa, coffee and orange juice also fell.  U.S. sugar  use  will drop 1 percent in the year that began
on Oct. 1 after climbing 5.4 percent a year earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Prices have more than
doubled since touching a 13-month low on May 7 as adverse
weather damaged crops in Russia, China and Brazil, the world’s
biggest producer.  “Demand for the time being is totally dead,” said  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle, Switzerland.
“With high prices, we will have some substitution of
sweeteners,” such as high-fructose syrup made from corn, he
said.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.3 cent, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at 32.81 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. The price rose in the previous 10 session, the
longest advance since January 2006.  Yesterday, the commodity climbed to 33.32 cents, the
highest level since January 1981.  “There is some profit-taking,”  Bruno Lima , a risk-
management consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in Campinas, Brazil.
“Some buyers may be waiting for prices to fall a bit before
returning to the market.”  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery dropped
