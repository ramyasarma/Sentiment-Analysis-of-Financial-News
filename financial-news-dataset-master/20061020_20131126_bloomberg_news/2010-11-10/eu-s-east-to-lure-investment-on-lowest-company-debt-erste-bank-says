Czech, Slovak and Polish companies
are Europe’s least indebted and their return on capital is among
the region’s highest, making them more attractive for investors
than their peers in the euro region,  Erste Group Bank AG  said.  The three countries are the only European Union members in
which non-financial companies’ gross debt in 2009 was lower than
the value they created that year, Erste wrote in a report
to clients today. This compares with a 203 percent average for
the euro area, with Belgium, Portugal and Ireland owing more
than 300 percent of the gross-value added, the report shows.  While “a huge pile of debt” at non-financials in
developed Europe adds to their “lack of competitiveness,”
peers in central and east Europe have preserved low indebtedness
and raised efficiency during the global financial crisis,  Juraj Kotian , co-head of macroeconomic research in Vienna, wrote in
the note.  “The much lower indebtedness and high return on capital
will enable central and east European companies to efficiently
compete for capital in highly indebted Europe,” Kotian wrote.  Slovak companies had a 26 percent gross return on capital,
the EU’s highest, with returns in Lithuania, Romania, the Czech
Republic and Poland also above 15 percent, the report said. The
euro region had an average of 8.1 percent, with non-financials
in Sweden, Portugal and Belgium returning less than 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
