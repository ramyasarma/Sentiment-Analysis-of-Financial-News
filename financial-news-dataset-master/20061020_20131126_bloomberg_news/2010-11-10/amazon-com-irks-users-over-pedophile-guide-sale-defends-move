Amazon.com Inc., the world’s largest
online retailer, sparked user anger over its sale of a book that
bills itself as a guide for pedophiles.  “The Pedophile’s Guide to Love and Pleasure,” written and
published by Phillip R. Greaves, has been on sale since Oct. 28,
according to Seattle-based Amazon, which defended its decision
to sell the book.  The guide has received 513  customer reviews , 498 of them
giving it one star. Users also associated tags, or categories,
to the guide. The most commonly used was “offensive,” followed
by “disgusting.” Amazon said pulling the book from its online
store would be censorship.  “Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books
simply because we or others believe their message is
objectionable,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.
“Amazon does not support or promote hatred or criminal acts,
however, we do support the right of every individual to make
their own purchasing decisions.”  Parry Aftab is  executive director  of  Wired Safety , a New
York-based nonprofit group that promotes safe use of technology
by children. She said a decision to pull the book would only
draw more attention to it.  “There are better ways of dealing with this issue than
having Amazon not sell it,” Aftab said. “The more noise that
people make about it, the more people will buy it.”  Amazon rose $3.06 to $173.33 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
