Vivo Participacoes SA , Brazil’s
biggest wireless carrier by market share, rose the most in three
months as its third-quarter profit jumped 81 percent after it
increased subscribers and lowered financial expenses.  Vivo’s  preferred shares  rose 3 percent to 52.73 reais at
9:08 a.m. New York time. The shares earlier climbed as much as
4.6 percent, the most since Aug. 18. The  benchmark Bovespa index 
fell 0.2 percent.  Net income advanced to 601.8 million reais ($353.7 million)
from 332.7 million reais a year earlier, Vivo said today in a
regulatory filing. Net operating sales increased 10 percent to
4.61 billion reais. The  average estimate  for profit excluding
some items was 366.1 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  “Vivo’s very strong commercial performance on the postpaid
segment is part of the explanation for the strong results,”
Banco BTG Pactual SA analysts, including  Carlos Sequeira , wrote
in a report to clients today. “The company grabbed 50 percent
of all net new postpaid clients added to the system” in the
quarter.  Vivo ended the three-month period with 57.7 million
clients, an increase of 18 percent from a year earlier. The Sao
Paulo-based company’s share of the Brazilian mobile-phone market
rose to 30.1 percent in September from 29.4 percent a year
earlier, according to telecommunications regulator Anatel. The
market expanded by 15 percent in that period.  Telefonica  Net financial expenses fell to 63.5 million reais in the
quarter from 98 million reais a year earlier, the company said.
The decrease was helped by reduced debt after a payment to
Anatel for 3G licenses, and by lower debt-service costs, Vivo
said. Depreciation and amortization expenses fell 30 percent in
the quarter.  Spain’s  Telefonica SA  bought  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA ’s
stake in the venture that controls Vivo for 7.5 billion euros
($10.3 billion) in July. Telefonica plans to combine
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA , its Brazilian fixed-line unit
known as Telesp, with Vivo to form the largest
telecommunications operator in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
