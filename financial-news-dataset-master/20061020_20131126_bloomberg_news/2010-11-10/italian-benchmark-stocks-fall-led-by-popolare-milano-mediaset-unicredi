Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
dropped 166.64, or 0.8 percent, to 21,411.84 at 11:29 a.m. in
Milan.  The following stocks rose or fell in the Italian equity
market today.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl  (PMI IM) fell 2.9 percent to
3.16 euros. The Milan-based cooperative bank said third-quarter
profit dropped 34 percent to 37.7 million euros ($52 million) on
lower revenue and higher costs.  Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) tumbled 5.2 percent to 5.13 euros,
poised for the steepest retreat since May. The broadcaster owned
by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi posted a loss of 49
million euros in the third quarter on charges related to
investments. The company today reiterated its forecast of an
increase in full-year net income.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM) dropped 1.9 percent to 1.79 euros.
Italy’s biggest bank said third-quarter profit declined 15
percent to 334 million euros after lower trading income
outweighed a drop in bad-loan provisions. The result missed the
388 million-euro average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
