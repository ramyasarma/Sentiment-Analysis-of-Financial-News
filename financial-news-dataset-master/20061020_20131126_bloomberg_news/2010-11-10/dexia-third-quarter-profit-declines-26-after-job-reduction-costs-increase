Dexia SA , the lender that received a
6 billion-euro ($8.2 billion) bailout during the credit crisis,
said third-quarter profit declined 26 percent, hurt by costs
related to job reductions.  Net income  fell to 203 million euros from 274 million euros
a year earlier, the Paris- and Brussels-based bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. Dexia’s costs rose 6.2 percent in the
period, including a charge of 93 million euros related to a plan
to cut an additional 665 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
