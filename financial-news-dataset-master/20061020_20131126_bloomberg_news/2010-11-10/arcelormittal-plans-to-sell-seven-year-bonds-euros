ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest
steelmaker, offered investors about half the yield it paid in
May 2009 to sell 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of bonds.  The new seven-year notes were priced at 232 basis points
more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, equivalent to a yield of 4.742 percent.
The Luxembourg-based company issued the same amount of similar-
maturity notes in May 2009 priced at 9.5 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite concerns of European sovereign debt, it’s still a
great time for companies to come to the market,” said  Suki Mann , a credit strategist in London at Societe Generale SA,
France’s second-largest bank.  ArcelorMittal was downgraded to  BBB- , the lowest
investment-grade ranking, by Standard & Poor’s earlier this
month after the ratings firm said a market rebound in the steel
sector has stalled. Moody’s Investors Service rates the
steelmaker an equivalent Baa3.  The average yield investors demand to hold BBB rated debt
in euros is 5.06 percent, close to the lowest level since March
2007, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Giles Read , a London-based spokesman for ArcelorMittal said
the proceeds of the note sale will be used to refinance debt.  ArcelorMittal issued $2.5 billion of bonds in three parts
in August to repay debt maturing through 2012. The company
issued 1.5 billion euros of four-year bonds in May 2009 priced
to yield 8.375 percent, and 1 billion euros of seven-year notes
at a yield of 9.5 percent, Bloomberg data show.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, ING Groep NV, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Natixis managed the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
