Caja Madrid, Spain’s second-largest
savings bank, plans to swap as much as 17 billion euros ($24
billion) of bonds for new longer-dated debt.  The lender will exchange government-guaranteed securities,
senior unsecured notes and covered bonds due in 2012 and 2013,
said two people with knowledge of the transaction. The swap may
include bonds issued by Bancaja, a lender that’s merging with
its larger counterpart Caja Madrid, the people said.  Holders of Caja Madrid’s government-guaranteed debt will
get new notes with state backing, while investors in senior and
covered bonds will receive comparable debt or securities with
state guarantees, said the people, who declined to be identified
before a public announcement.  Some of the new securities may also be offered to new
investors, the people said.  A Caja Madrid spokesman, who declined to be identified
citing company policy, wouldn’t comment on the transaction.  Covered bonds are backed by mortgages or public-sector
loans and are guaranteed by the issuer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
