A federal judge decided not to send
a Staten Island, New York, investment adviser to jail for
engaging in post-arrest activity similar to the conduct that led
to civil and criminal allegations against him.  U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, New
York, said he would not revoke bail for Kenneth Marsh, owner of
Gryphon Holdings Inc., who faces trial next year.   “The bail will not be revoked because we have to move to
trial,” Weinstein said, noting that Marsh is helping his lawyer
go through thousands of documents.  After his April arrest, Marsh tried to replicate at least
parts of the scheme to defraud investors he’s charged with,
prosecutors said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
