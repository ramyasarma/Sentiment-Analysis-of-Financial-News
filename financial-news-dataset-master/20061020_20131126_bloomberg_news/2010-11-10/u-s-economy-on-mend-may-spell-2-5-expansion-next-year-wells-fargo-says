The U.S. economy is growing “a
little bit quicker” and should expand by 2.5 percent next year,
said  John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC
in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “We definitely have improvement going on in the U.S.
economy,” Silvia said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . His previous estimate for 2011
growth was 2.1 percent.  Silvia cited improvement in Institute for Supply Management
reports on services and manufacturing in October for his 2011
growth forecast.  “I think we’re going to have a very good holiday season
and I think the spring will look good,” Silvia said about
consumer spending.  The jobless rate will be slow to decline, and may stay
close to 9 percent during the next two years, he said.
 Unemployment  has been at 9.6 percent for three straight months.  “A significant part of the unemployment rate is more
structural,” he said. “We have a lot of construction workers
who are just in the wrong spot and they can’t become IT
engineers tomorrow.”  Companies are starting to retain more workers. A Labor
Department report today showed initial  jobless claims  fell
435,000 last week, the lowest level in four months.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
