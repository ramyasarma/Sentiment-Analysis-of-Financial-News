European stocks  fell the most in two
weeks amid renewed concern that the region’s weakest economies
will struggle to reduce their deficits and as companies from
UniCredit SpA to Natixis SA had worse-than-estimated earnings.  Banks tumbled as the extra yield investors demand to hold
Irish government bonds instead of German bunds widened to a
record. UniCredit, Italy’s biggest lender, tumbled 4.6 percent.
Natixis, the investment-banking unit of Groupe BPCE, sank the
most in 15 months. BHP Billiton Ltd. fell 2.4 percent as copper
slid for the first time in five days.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.7 percent to
271.48 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, declining from the
highest level since September 2008. The gauge has climbed 17
percent since May as company earnings topped estimates and the
Federal Reserve unveiled a second round of asset purchases, a
tactic for boosting the economy known as quantitative easing.  “When you have Ireland trading at 600 basis points, Greece
and Spain where they are, you realize the answer is not printing
money,” said  Alberto Espelosin , who helps manage about $12
billion at Zaragoza, Spain-based Ibercaja Gestion. “The
problems in peripheral Europe are far from over.”  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets today. Ireland’s  ISEQ  sank 2.2 percent, the
most since August, as the yield spread of the nation’s
government bonds over German bunds widened to more than 600
basis points for the first time.  Greek, Portuguese Stocks  Greece’s ASE plunged 2 percent as the yield premium to
bunds widened to 900 basis points. Portugal’s PSI-20 slid 0.3
percent as an auction of government debt attracted bids for 2.1
times the amount of bonds offered, compared with a bid-to-cover
ratio of 4.9 in September.  “QE2 had a short-term positive impact but the problems are
still here,” said  Michael Koehler , head of strategy at
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Mainz, Germany. “We had a very
strong start to the earnings season and it’s difficult for
companies to surprise as much now. Investors are also
speculating again that the Chinese economy may be cooling
down.”  China’s central bank raised lenders’ reserve requirements
today as cash from October’s larger-than-forecast $27.1 billion
trade surplus threatened to add to the risk of asset bubbles and
accelerating inflation. Government data due for release tomorrow
will show the nation’s inflation rate climbed to 4 percent in
October, according to the median estimate of 28 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Banks Decline  A  measure of banks  fell the most in seven weeks as
peripheral European bonds tumbled. Banco Santander SA, Spain’s
biggest lender, retreated 2.9 percent to 8.40 euros. Credit
Agricole SA, France’s second-largest bank, declined 4.6 percent
to 11.66 euros.  KBC Groep NV plummeted 5.5 percent to 29.39 euros, a five-
month low. Belgium’s biggest bank and insurer posted a drop in
earnings in its home market and forecasted higher provisions for
Irish loan losses.  UniCredit fell 4.6 percent to 1.74 euros, the largest
drop since June. The bank said third-quarter profit declined 15
percent after lower trading income outweighed a drop in bad-loan
provisions. Net income fell to 334 million euros ($458 million),
missing the 388 million-euro average estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Natixis  plunged 12 percent to 3.93 euros, the biggest
decline since August 2009. Third-quarter profit fell 16 percent
to 305 million euros after changes in value of its own debt
curbed revenue, trailing the 366 million-euro average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BHP, Rio  BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, dropped
2.4 percent to 2,410 pence and Rio Tinto Group, the third-
largest, lost 2.7 percent to 4,333 pence. Copper, nickel, tin
and zinc fell in London trading.  Auto-industry shares fell the most among 19  industry groups 
in the Stoxx 600 as European Union regulators floated the idea
of tightening a cap on carbon dioxide from cars by almost 50
percent over a decade.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen AG, the region’s biggest
automaker, dropped 2.5 percent to 108.65 euros. PSA Peugeot
Citroen declined 2.3 percent to 29.60 euros.  Tiremakers  Michelin & Cie.  and Continental AG slid 3.4
percent to 55.49 euros and 3.5 percent to 57.93 euros,
respectively. Exane BNP Paribas downgraded both companies,
citing the impact of raw-material costs.  Mediaset Falls  Mediaset SpA  slumped 6.5 percent to 5.06 euros, the largest
retreat since May 2009. The broadcaster controlled by Italian
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  posted a loss in the third
quarter because of charges related to investments.  Henkel AG  preferred shares jumped 9.8 percent to 46.17
euros, the biggest jump since November 2008. The German maker of
Loctite glues and Persil detergent boosted its annual profit
forecast and said third-quarter net income rose 96 percent to
337 million euros.  Delhaize Group SA  rose 7.3 percent to 54.62 euros. The
owner of Food Lion supermarkets in the U.S. reported a 9.4
percent gain in third-quarter profit and confirmed its annual
forecast as the decline in U.S. comparable-store sales slowed.  Scottish & Southern Electricity Plc climbed 3.8 percent to
1,160 pence, the largest increase since March 2009, after profit
beat estimates and the utility said it can sustain dividend
growth of 2 percentage points above inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
