The Renault-Nissan alliance is
considering constructing a vehicle-assembly factory in Russia,
Sergei Darkin, the governor of the Primorsky region in the
country’s Far East, said.  “Renault-Nissan has expressed an interest in looking into
the possibility of building a new car assembly plant,” Darkin
told reporters in Seoul today. “We are in talks; I think they
will be successful.”  Oksana Nazarova, a Renault spokeswoman in Moscow,
confirmed that the company is studying a possibility of opening
a plant in the Primorsky region.  Renault SA  and its Japanese affiliate  Nissan Motor Co . may
double their holding of the Russian automaker OAO AvtoVAZ to 50
percent after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  gave the deal his
blessing, Renault Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said on
Nov 2. Renault, Nissan and AvtoVAZ aim for a combined market
share of 40 percent of the Russian market by 2015, or 1.6
million vehicles annually, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
