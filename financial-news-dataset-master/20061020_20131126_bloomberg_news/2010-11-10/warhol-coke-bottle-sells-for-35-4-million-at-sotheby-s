An almost 7-foot-tall Andy Warhol
painting of a glass Coca-Cola bottle sold for $35.4 million
tonight at Sotheby’s in New York.  The price fizzed past the projected $25 million high
estimate but fell short of the $71.7 million paid for a Warhol
green-hued painting of a car crash at Christie’s International
in 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
