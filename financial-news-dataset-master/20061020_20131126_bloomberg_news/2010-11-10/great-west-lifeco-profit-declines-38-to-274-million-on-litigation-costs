Great-West Lifeco Inc. , the owner of
Boston-based Putnam Investments, said third-quarter profit
declined 38 percent after the insurer took provisions for
litigation. The stock had its biggest one-day decline in more
than two months.  Net income fell to C$275 million ($274 million), or 29
cents a share, from C$445 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier,
the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based company said today in a statement.  Great-West, controlled by Montreal’s Desmarais family, said
it recorded a C$225 million litigation provision related to an
Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruling.  The court ordered Great-West to pay C$456 million related
to how its units financed the acquisition of London Life
Insurance Group in 1997. Great-West has said it plans to appeal
the decision.  Great-West is the last of Canada’s four biggest life
insurers to report quarterly results.  Manulife Financial Corp.,
Canada’s largest insurer, said last week that its third-quarter
loss widened to C$947 million, or 55 cents a share. Sun Life
Financial Inc. had net income of C$453 million, or 79 cents a
share, compared with a year-earlier loss.  Great-West, Canada’s second-biggest insurer, fell 65 cents,
or 2.4 percent, to C$26.41 in 4 p.m. trading on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
