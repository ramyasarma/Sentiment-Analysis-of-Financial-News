The pound may extend gains against
the euro should it close stronger than 85.04 pence, Royal Bank
of Canada said, citing technical indicators.  Gains to that level, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of
the euro’s advance between June and October, would “add to
downside risks” for the common currency,  George Davis , chief
technical analyst for fixed-income and currency strategy at the
RBC Dominion Securities unit of Canada’s largest lender, wrote
in a note today.  “This development would then expose congestive support
from September at 84.63 pence, followed by the 61.8 percent
retracement level at 84.02 pence,” Toronto-based Davies wrote.  The euro declined for a fifth day, losing 0.9 percent to
85.36 pence at 5:30 p.m. in London. The common currency climbed
6.2 percent between June 30 and Oct. 29, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security
commodity, currency or index. Support is a level where orders to
buy may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
