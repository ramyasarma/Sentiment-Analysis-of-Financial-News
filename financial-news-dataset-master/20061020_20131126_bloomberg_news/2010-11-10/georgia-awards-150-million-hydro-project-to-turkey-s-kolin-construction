The Georgian government awarded a
$150 million hydropower project to Turkey’s  Kolin Construction,
Tourism Industry and Trading Co. Inc. , the Energy Ministry said.  Kolin will build a cascade of four hydropower plants with a
minimum total capacity of 105.7 megawatts on the Tekhuri River
in the Samegrelo region of western Georgia, the ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today. Construction will take four years,
the ministry said.  Under ministry rules, investors given hydropower plant
concessions agree for 10 years to sell power for domestic
consumption only during three months each winter, when the
former Soviet republic often experiences shortages, and are free
to sell to any customer in Georgia or abroad for the rest of the
year.  President  Mikheil Saakashvili  said on Nov. 8 that Georgia
may receive as much as $5 billion of investment in hydropower
over the next seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
