Kajaria Ceramics Ltd. , an Indian
ceramic tile maker backed by billionaire investor  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala , may spend as much as 1.5 billion rupees ($33.8
million) on a new unit in the nation’s south to meet demand.  “There is huge demand in the south that we are not able to
satisfy,” Finance Director  Sanjeev Agarwal  said in a telephone
interview. “Our cash flow is sufficient to take care of the
expansion.”  India’s expanding economy, which has grown an average 8.5
percent per annum for the past five years, is stoking demand for
building materials used in homes, shopping complexes and
offices. A 52 percent surge in Kajaria’s  share price  this year
compares with a 20 percent advance in the benchmark Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index.  The shares  rose  1 percent to 79.55 rupees as of 10:48 a.m.
local time in Mumbai, while the benchmark stock gauge fell 0.1
percent.  Net income will rise 53 percent from a year earlier to 550
million rupees in the 12 months through March, Agarwal
forecasts, while sales will reach 10.5 billion rupees, a 43
percent increase.  Output at an existing plant in north-western India’s
Rajasthan state will increase by fourfold in January as a new
product line commences, Agarwal said. The unit in southern India
may be built in the year beginning April 2012, he said.  Jhunjhunwala, named by Forbes magazine as the  Warren Buffett  of India, owns about 3.4 percent of Kajaria, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
