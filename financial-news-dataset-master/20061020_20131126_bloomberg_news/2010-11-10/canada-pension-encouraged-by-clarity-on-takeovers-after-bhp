Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
supports a move by Canada to review its foreign takeover rules
after the federal government blocked BHP Billiton Ltd.’s hostile
bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  “We’re encouraged by the government’s signal that they
intend to clarify the guidelines that they will use going
forward,” Canada Pension Chief Executive Officer  David Denison 
said today in an interview.  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said in the House of Commons
on Nov. 4 that foreign investment rules should be reviewed. His
comments came a day after Industry Minister  Tony Clement 
rejected Melbourne-based BHP’s $40 billion bid for Potash Corp.,
saying the proposal doesn’t provide a “net benefit” to Canada.  “What we encourage, and strongly look for is clarity
around how those frameworks will operate,” Denison said. “We
strongly encourage other countries around the world as well, to
make it clear what the rules are and how they will be applied.”  Toronto-based Canada Pension, with C$139 billion ($139
billion) in assets, looks at “any investment opportunity that
comes up” such as Potash Corp., Denison said. “We indicated in
earlier comments that we weren’t involved in anything formal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
