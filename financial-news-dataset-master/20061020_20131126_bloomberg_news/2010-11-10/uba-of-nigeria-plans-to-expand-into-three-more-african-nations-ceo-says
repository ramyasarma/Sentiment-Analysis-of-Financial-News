United Bank for Africa Plc ,
Nigeria’s fourth-biggest lender by market value, plans to start
operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo
and Mozambique before the end of this year, Chief Executive
Officer  Phillips Oduoza  said.  “We already secured the licenses and we are just in the
process of going live in these countries,” he said in an
interview in Lagos today. “We see a lot of potential; this is
the time to start positioning ourselves, and we are gaining a
lot of experience and products from these countries.”  UBA’s branches outside Nigeria will be a part of a holding
company it plans to form to comply with the central bank’s
request that lenders separate their banking and non-banking
businesses to allow for better supervision, he said.  After a debt crisis last year that almost crippled banking
in Africa’s most populous country, the central bank in March
said lenders needed to separate unites and choose whether to
operate as regional, national or international lenders. The
regulator set minimum capital requirements ranging from 15
billion naira ($100 million) for regional banks to 100 billion
naira for international lenders.  UBA shares  rose for a third day, adding 0.3 percent to 9.42
naira by the 1 p.m. close in Lagos, extending their gain this
year to 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
