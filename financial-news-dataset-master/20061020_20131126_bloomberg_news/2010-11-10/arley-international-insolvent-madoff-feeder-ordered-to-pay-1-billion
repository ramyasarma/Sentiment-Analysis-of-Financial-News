Harley International (Cayman) Ltd.,
an insolvent Cayman Islands-based fund that allegedly funneled
money to  Bernard Madoff , was ordered to pay $1.07 billion to
creditors of the convicted con man.  Irving Picard , the trustee overseeing the liquidation of
Madoff’s former firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, sued Harley in May 2009, seeking to recover phony profits
paid to Harley in the six years before the Madoff bankruptcy was
filed.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Lifland in New York today
entered a judgment against Harley, which is being liquidated in
the Cayman Islands, after ruling the fund had failed to contest
the suit within the deadline for doing so.  In an Oct. 29 report to Lifland detailing his efforts over
the past six months, Picard said he plans to sue Harley in a
Cayman Islands court.  “We will take such action as we deem appropriate to seek
to recover on the judgment,” Kevin McCue, a spokesman for
Picard, said in an e-mail today.  A phone message seeking comment from Nicolas Matthews and
Mark Longbottom of Kinetic Partners, the joint liquidators of
Harley, wasn’t immediately returned.  Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year prison sentence in North
Carolina after pleading guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history.  The case is Picard v. Harley International (Cayman) Ltd.,
09-AP-1187, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
