New Zealand’s trading partners could
use the outbreak of a kiwifruit disease in the North Island as
grounds to ban imports of the fruit, the New Zealand Herald
reported, citing Biosecurity Minister  David Carter .  While no trade restrictions have been placed on kiwifruit,
the minister said that such a situation was a “very real
possibility,” according to the Auckland-based newspaper.  Australia and the U.S. said they weren’t planning to ban
the New Zealand fruit after stopping imports of kiwifruit plant
material, the newspaper said. Carter could not “give an
assurance that will be the situation of the future,” the  Herald
reported .  Kiwifruit exports earned New Zealand’s economy about NZ$1.4
billion in the year ended March 31, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
