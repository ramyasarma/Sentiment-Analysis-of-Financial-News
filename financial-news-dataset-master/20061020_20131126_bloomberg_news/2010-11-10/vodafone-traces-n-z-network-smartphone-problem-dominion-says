Vodafone Group Plc has identified
the cause of problems in its New Zealand third-generation mobile
network and expects to have them repaired early next week, the
Dominion Post reported.  Engineers from network supplier Nokia Siemens Networks BV
have isolated the problem, which caused smartphones to stall
when connecting to the Internet, the Post reported, citing Tony
Baird, head of networks at Vodafone New Zealand.  Late yesterday, the company said the issue had been traced
to its cellsite network. The symptoms included missed calls,
delayed text messages, being unable to make calls unless the
device is powered off, and an inability to set up data sessions,
it said on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
