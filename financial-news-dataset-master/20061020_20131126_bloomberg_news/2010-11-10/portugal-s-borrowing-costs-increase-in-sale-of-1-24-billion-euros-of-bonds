Portugal sold 1.24 billion euros
($1.7 billion) of bonds, close to the maximum target of 1.25
billion euros the government planned to raise through debt sales
today. The nation’s bonds fell.  The IGCP, the country’s debt agency, sold 556 million euros
of bonds due in 2016 and 686 million euros of bonds due in 2020.
Both securities drew bids more than twice the amount of debt on
offer. Bonds in Ireland, Portugal and Greece have slumped since
European Union leaders agreed on Oct. 29 to consider German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s proposal for a permanent rescue
mechanism that would involve debt restructuring with losses for
private holders of sovereign bonds.  “The auction went pretty well, but it’s not going to be a
turning point in the market because the bigger picture in the
peripheral market hasn’t changed,” said  Jamie Searle , a fixed-
income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. “There’re
negative headlines about Ireland and that has pushed up
peripheral bond spreads. Portugal remains caught up in that
negative sentiment.”  Portuguese 10-year yields climbed 30 basis points, or 0.3
percentage point, to 7.23 percent today, as Irish bonds led a
slide in debt of Europe’s high-deficit countries. Finance
Minister  Fernando Teixeira  dos Santos said the auction was a
success, while calling on European leaders to quickly clarify
how much bondholders would lose in any debt restructurings.  Yields Rise  The securities due October 2016 were issued at an average
yield of 6.156 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 4.371 percent at a
previous auction of the same-maturity debt on Aug. 25. The
auction attracted bids for 2.3 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1 in August.  The bonds due June 2020 were issued at an average yield of
6.806 percent. That compares with an average yield of 6.242
percent at the last auction of the same-maturity debt on Sept.
22. Today’s auction attracted bids for 2.1 times the amount
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.9 in September.  “It went better than expected,” said  Jose Brandao de Brito , head of financial markets research at Millennium
Investment Banking in Lisbon. “The average yield that came out
in the auction was lower than the yields in the secondary
market.”  The IGCP on Nov. 4 said the combined indicative amount for
the bonds in today’s auction would range from 750 million euros
to 1.25 billion euros.  “The upper end of the interval was practically reached,”
Brandao de Brito said. “In a context in which access to the
market is difficult, that’s good news.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Portuguese
bonds instead of German bunds widened to 446 basis points at 5
p.m. London time today from 432 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
