French Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde said the increase in France’s retirement age that became
law this week shows that the country is capable of completing
economic reforms.  “We’ve finally showed our capacity to reform,” Lagarde
said today on Radio Classique. “It proves we’re able to take a
financial problem and apply rules, even if it’s painful.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
