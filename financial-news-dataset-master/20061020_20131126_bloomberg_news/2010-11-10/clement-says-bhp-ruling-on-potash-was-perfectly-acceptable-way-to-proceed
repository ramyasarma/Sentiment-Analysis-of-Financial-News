Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement said the government made a “perfectly acceptable”
decision when it blocked BHP Billiton Ltd.’s bid for Potash
Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  “This is a perfectly acceptable thing to do in global
commerce,” Clement told reporters today in Peterborough,
Ontario. The government will continue to approve takeovers
except when there is a threat to national interests, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
