Canada’s dollar climbed to the
highest level in seven weeks against the euro on speculation
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will make currencies related to
commodities more attractive.  The loonie rose versus all of its most-traded counterparts
after dropping against most of them in October on concern a
stalled U.S. recovery would slow Canada’s economy. The Canadian
dollar rose versus the greenback today as crude oil gained.  “In the commodity space it’s been far more positive for
prices,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered in New York, in an telephone interview. “You
would expect to see the euro underperform commodity currencies
broadly.”  The Canadian currency climbed 0.9 percent to C$1.3760
versus the euro at 12:50 p.m. in New York, from C$1.3884
yesterday. The loonie gained 0.6 percent to C$1.0022 per U.S.
dollar, from C$1.0080 yesterday.  The loonie was supported as Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty 
said Chinese insurance companies will be allowed to invest in
Canada through their wealth-management operations,  The agreement with China gives Canadian financial markets
access to a pool of up to C$106 billion ($106 billion), Flaherty
said in a statement today from Seoul, South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
