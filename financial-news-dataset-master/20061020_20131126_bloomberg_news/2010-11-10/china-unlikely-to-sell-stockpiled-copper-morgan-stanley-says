China, which has sold aluminum and
zinc from government reserves this year, isn’t likely to sell
copper even as prices gain, according to  Peter Richardson , chief
metals economist at Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.  Richardson made the comments in an interview with Bloomberg
News yesterday in Singapore. Copper futures in New York have
gained 19 percent this year, peaking at $4.0475 a pound
yesterday.  “The higher we go above $4, the greater the temptation
will be to do it but if you’re under siege and you’ve got a
limited amount of ammunition, you could make a serious mistake
firing off too soon.  “Their stockpiles reflect exactly the metals in surplus.
It’s what they’re not selling that’s most illuminating. They
don’t have enough to materially influence the market. They’d be
better off to hold their fire and wait for a push back on the
demand side to soften the price and gradually pick up more, than
fire it off and find they’ve got absolutely nothing because
that’s not how strategic stockpiles are managed.  “In 2006, 2007, they sold aggressively into a very strong
and rising market and virtually denuded themselves of
significant stocks of refined copper. If there’s 1 million tons,
why is it not coming back into the market? There was an excess
imported last year, but it wasn’t 1 million tons.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
