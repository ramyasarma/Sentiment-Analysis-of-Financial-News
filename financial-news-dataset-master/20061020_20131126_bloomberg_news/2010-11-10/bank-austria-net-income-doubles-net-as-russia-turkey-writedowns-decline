UniCredit Bank Austria AG, which
manages most of UniCredit’s units in emerging Europe, said third
quarter net income more than doubled as writedowns on bad loans
fell 31 percent, mostly in Turkey and Russia.  Net income rose to 302 million euros ($415 million) from
139 million euros in the previous year, Vienna-based Bank
Austria said in an emailed statement. Loan loss provisions
declined to 418 million euros from 603 million euros in the
previous year and was also less than in the second quarter.  “The provisioning charge improved, although there are wide
regional variations,” Bank Austria said in the statement. “In
Turkey, successful debt collection efforts enabled the local
bank to release loan loss provisions,” it said. “An easing of
the situation was also seen in Russia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
