Assurant Inc. , the insurer of
foreclosed properties whose stock plunged after a report citing
“evidence of abuses” in the industry, said the pricing of its
policies reflects the “unique risk” of the homes it covers.  “Many of the properties we insure have a history of
multiple losses,” said  Gene Mergelmeyer , president of the New
York-based company’s specialty unit, in a conference call today.  Assurant held the call after its stock fell as much as 17
percent today, following an American Banker article on the
market for so-called force-placed coverage. Mortgage servicers
are profiting at the expense of homeowners and investors by
taking payments from the insurers they select to issue force-
placed policies on properties where distressed borrowers allow
their original coverage to lapse, American Banker said.  Assurant pays commissions that are comparable to those paid
by insurers in the voluntary market, Mergelmeyer said. The
company’s average policy costs about $2,000 and the average
value of the homes it covers is $180,000, the company said.  The insurer slipped $4.48, or 11 percent, to $35.66 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has advanced about 21 percent this year.  Assurant competes with Bank of America Corp., Munich Re and
Australia’s QBE Insurance Group Ltd. for sales of force-placed
coverage. The policies are riskier than typical home coverage
because the properties are more prone to neglect or vandalism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
