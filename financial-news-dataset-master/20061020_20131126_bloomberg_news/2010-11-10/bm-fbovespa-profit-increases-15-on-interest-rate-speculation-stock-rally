BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, said third-quarter
profit rose 15 percent as investors increased interest-rate bets
and an equity market rally boosted the value of stock trades.  Net income excluding some items climbed to 389.2 million
reais ($233.9 million) from 338.4 million reais a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing. That
exceeded the average estimate of 348.6 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of eight analysts. Net income without
adjustments was 293.2 million reais, while net operating revenue
climbed 27 percent to 486.9 million reais.  Investors increased trading of interest-rate futures after
slowing economic growth sparked speculation the central bank
will stop raising the benchmark  Selic  this year. As stocks
advanced, Brazil’s average  market value  in the quarter rose 22
percent from a year earlier to $1.26 billion, increasing the
revenue from trades.  “Uncertainty on the Selic rate spurred investors to make
more bets,” said  Daniel Malheiros , an analyst at Spinelli
Corretora who has a “hold” recommendation on the stock. “On
the Bovespa side, the volume rose. These were the drivers for
growth.”  The company boosted its operational spending forecast for
this year to between 540 million reais and 545 million reais in
a separate filing, up from 520.3 million reais previously
announced. It also forecast planned investments for 2010 at
between 250 million reais and 272 million reais.  BM&FBovespa’s shares have advanced 12 percent this year,
compared to a 4.5 percent increase for the benchmark  Bovespa 
stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
