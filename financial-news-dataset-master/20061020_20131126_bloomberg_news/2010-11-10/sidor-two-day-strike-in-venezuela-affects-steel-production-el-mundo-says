Siderurgica del Orinoco’s two-day
strike at Venezuela’s biggest steel mill, is affecting the
supply of steel this week to the national market,  El Mundo 
reported, citing company President Carlos De Oliveira.  Union workers blocked the entrance to Sidor, as it is
known, on Nov. 8 and 9, Oliveira said, according to El Mundo.
The workers were protesting the non-payment of bonuses and
demanding their contracts be renegotiated, El Mundo said today.  Tahidy Leon, a spokeswoman for Sidor, said the strikers had
blocked other workers from entering the factory. She didn’t have
a figure for how much production was affected.  Oliveria said Sidor is operating at 75 percent of its
capacity following an electricity crisis earlier this year in
which factories were forced to cut production to save energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
