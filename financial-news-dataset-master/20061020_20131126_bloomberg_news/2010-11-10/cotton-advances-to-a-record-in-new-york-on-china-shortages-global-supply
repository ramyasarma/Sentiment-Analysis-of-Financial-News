Cotton futures advanced to record in
New York after the U.S. government cut its estimate on global
production and inventories and cited a shortage in China, the
world’s biggest buyer and consumer.  The March-delivery contract gained as much as 3.3 percent
to $1.5195 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York and traded at
$1.4820 at 11:53 a.m. Singapore time. Futures have doubled this
year, making them the best performer among 19 commodities on the
UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture yesterday lowered its
global output estimate to 115.25 million bales, from 116.68
million bales a month earlier, and forecast that stockpiles will
decline to 42.2 million bales. That will be the lowest global
stockpile in 15 years, according to the agency’s data. A bale
weighs about 480 pounds.  “Cotton supply only continues to get tighter and demand
remains strong,”  Claudio Oliveira , head of trading at New York-
based Castlestone Management LLC., said in an e-mail today.
“Stockpiles worldwide are feeling the pinch.”  The USDA shaved its estimate on China’s inventory by July
31 to 13.221 million bales, from 14.721 million bales a month
earlier, citing “shortages which have become apparent over the
past several weeks, indicating minimal inventories available for
mills to continue operations.”  “The single most important price driver is a supply
shortage in China, which has far exceeded expectations and has
resulted in recent prices paid to producers of an unprecedented
$2 a pound,” the USDA said in its  report  yesterday.  Cotton futures in Zhengzhou advanced to a record for a
fourth straight day, more doubling the price this year, and
boosting costs for textile makers.  The contract for May delivery rallied as much as 2.2
percent to 33,720 yuan ($5,079) a ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange, before trading at 33,385 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
