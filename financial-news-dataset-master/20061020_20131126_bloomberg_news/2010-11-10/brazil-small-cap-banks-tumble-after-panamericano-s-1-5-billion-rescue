Stocks and bonds of Brazil’s
smallest banks tumbled after  Banco Panamericano SA ’s 2.5
billion-real ($1.5 billion) rescue raised concerns over industry
accounting practices.  Panamericano plummeted 30 percent to 4.77 reais at the
close of trading in Sao Paulo at 3 p.m. New York time.  Banco
Industrial e Comercial SA , or BicBanco, sank 5.4 percent to
15.00 reais.  Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA  slipped 1.3 percent to
14.95 reais after earlier losing as much as 6.3 percent. Parana
Banco SA fell 4.4 percent, the most since June, to 14.00 reais.  Panamericano got the bailout from its controlling
shareholder Grupo  Silvio Santos  yesterday after uncovering
“accounting inconsistencies” that led to erroneous financial
statements. The rescue, while likely “an isolated event,” may
increase funding costs for peers, Credit Suisse Group AG said in
a note to clients today.  “People are worried about the sector overall,” said  Ed Kuczma , who helps oversee $21 billion at Van Eck Associates in
New York. “It does raise red flags as it could be part of a
larger network of transactions. A lot of questions need to be
answered.”  Big Banks Benefit  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Latin America’s biggest bank by
market value, rose 1.2 percent to 42.85 reais while  Banco
Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market value,
increased 1.4 percent to 36.50 reais.  “The competitive position of large banks should be
enhanced versus smaller players,”  Marcelo Telles , an analyst at
Credit Suisse, said in the note.  Cruzeiro’s 8.875 percent bonds due in 2020 sank 2 cents on
the dollar to 103 cents, according to Trace. The yield jumped 29
basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 8.41 percent.
BicBanco’s five-year, 5.25 percent notes dropped 1.9 cents to
98.97 cents. The yield soared 44 basis points to 5.49 percent.  Chris Palmer , who oversees about $5 billion as head of
global emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management Ltd.
in London, said he didn’t sell any of his holding in lender
 Banco ABC Brasil SA  in reaction to the rescue. Gartmore doesn’t
hold Panamericano shares.  “The silver lining to this story is that the Brazilian
banking regulator and Brazilian banking system are responsive,”
Palmer said. “That’s going to allow the rest of the banks to
get on with their business. This problem will go away very
quickly.”  Banco ABC Brasil fell 0.8 percent to 16.30 reais after
losing as much as 8 percent earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
