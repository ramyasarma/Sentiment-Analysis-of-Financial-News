Global-warming talks later this
month are the “last chance” for countries to reach an
agreement on cutting emissions of gases blamed for rising
temperatures, India’s environment minister said today.  “The credibility of the entire climate change negotiating
system is at stake,”  Jairam Ramesh  told reporters at a meeting
in Delhi. “If we do not get a set of operational and meaningful
decisions at Cancun everybody will be sick and tired of us.”  Nations will attempt to forge a deal on curbing greenhouse
gases at this month’s  United Nations -organized summit in Cancun,
Mexico, something that eluded last year’s meeting in Copenhagen.  Ramesh was speaking after two days of talks in India’s
capital, where 35 nations agreed that giving poorer countries
access to technology that can reduce emissions should form part
of any “comprehensive and balanced” package finalized in
Cancun.  Negotiations aimed at limiting carbon-dioxide emissions
have been bogged down by conflicts over providing money for poor
countries to adjust to climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
