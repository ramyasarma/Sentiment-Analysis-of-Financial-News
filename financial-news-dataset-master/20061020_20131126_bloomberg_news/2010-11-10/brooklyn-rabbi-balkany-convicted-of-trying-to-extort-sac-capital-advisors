Milton Balkany, a Brooklyn rabbi,
was convicted on charges he tried to extort $4 million from
 Steven Cohen ’s SAC Capital Advisors LP by claiming he could
prevent a federal inmate from telling authorities about alleged
insider trades.  Balkany, 64, was convicted of all four criminal counts of
extortion, blackmail, making false statements and wire fraud.
The trial began Nov. 1. The wire fraud conviction carries a
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  Balkany, who was dean of the Bais Yaakov day school in the
Borough Park neighborhood in Brooklyn, told the Connecticut-
based hedge fund that he was the spiritual adviser to a federal
prisoner in Otisville, New York, according to prosecutors.  He told a lawyer for the hedge fund that the inmate would
keep quiet about alleged illegal trading by the fund in 2004 and
2005 if they paid his school and another school $2 million each,
prosecutors said.  The lawyer instead recorded his phone calls and meetings
with Balkany.  Balkany was arrested in February after taking two checks
from SAC totaling $3.25 million. Balkany told an SAC official at
the time that the inmate wouldn’t talk to federal authorities at
a meeting scheduled the following day. No such meeting was
actually planned, according to the government.  The case is U.S. v. Balkany, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
