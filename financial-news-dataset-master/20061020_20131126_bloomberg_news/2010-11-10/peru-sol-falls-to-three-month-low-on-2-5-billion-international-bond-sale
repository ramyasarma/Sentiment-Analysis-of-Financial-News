Peru’s sol fell to its weakest level
in three months after the government offered $2.5 billion of
bonds in the international market to repay debt and pre-finance
next year’s budget.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.8008 per U.S. dollar at
11:28 a.m. New York time, from 2.7985 yesterday. The currency
earlier touched 2.8035, its weakest since Aug. 17.  Peru plans to sell $1.5 billion of sol-denominated debt due
in 2020 that will yield 5.75 percent, according to a person
familiar with the offering. The government will also sell $1
billion of 40-year dollar bonds that will pay a yield of 5.875
percent, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren’t set.  Peruvian banks and pension funds may need to buy dollars if
they purchase the sol bond, which is redeemable in dollars, said
 Gonzalo Navarro , head trader at Banco Santander in Lima. Foreign
investors participating in today’s bond sale are allowing non-
deliverable forward contracts to expire, spurring demand for
dollars in the spot market, Navarro said.  “Forward contracts of about $200 million are expiring
today,” Navarro said. “Normally a good part of these contracts
are renewed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
