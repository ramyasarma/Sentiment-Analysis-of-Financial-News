The Federal Reserve may not complete
the full $600 billion of securities purchases it announced last
week to stimulate the economy, said Stanford University
economist  John B. Taylor .  “It’s a real possibility” the central bank will stop
before completing the purchases it plans to make through June,
Taylor said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness with  Margaret Brennan .”  “I hope so. They left themselves some wiggle room,” he
said. Though the policy is aimed at lowering  unemployment ,
Taylor said “I don’t see it having that effect. To me it raises
a lot of risks. I don’t think it’s a stimulus.”  Taylor said that skeptics within the central bank may gain
traction with their arguments, such as Fed Governor  Kevin Warsh ,
who said Nov. 8 that he is “less optimistic than some that
additional asset purchases will have significant, durable
benefits for the real economy.”  The Federal Open Market Committee, in its Nov. 3 statement,
said policy makers “will adjust the program as needed.” Taylor
said that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will complete
the purchases.  Taylor, 63, is the creator of the eponymous Taylor Rule,
used to determine the appropriate level for interest rates. He
was an undersecretary of the Treasury during the presidency of
 George W. Bush .  To contact the reporters on this story:
