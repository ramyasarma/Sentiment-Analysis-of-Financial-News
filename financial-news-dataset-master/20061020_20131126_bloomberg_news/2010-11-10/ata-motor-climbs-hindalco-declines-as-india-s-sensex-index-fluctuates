India’s benchmark stock index
declined.  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  and  Hindalco Industries Ltd.  led
the drop after posting quarterly earnings that fell short of
analyst estimates.  Bharti Airtel, the largest mobile-phone operator, dropped
the most in two weeks after its profit fell 27 percent as it cut
call rates to win a larger share of the market in Africa and
compete with 14 other companies in India. Hindalco, the biggest
aluminum producer, slid to its lowest close in four days.  “Investors are reacting to the corporate results,” said
 Kaushik Dani , a Mumbai-based fund manager with Peerless Mutual
Fund, which manages $598 million in assets. Dani declined to
comment on specific shares.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 56.77, or 0.3 percent, to 20,875.71 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, after swinging between gains and losses more
than 25 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 6,275.70. The  BSE 200 Index 
retreated 0.3 percent to 2,652.54.  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at 20 times earnings after
the gauge jumped 20 percent this year, the best performance and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bharti Profit  Bharti Airtel decreased 2.2 percent to 327.05 rupees, its
biggest drop since Oct. 26. Second-quarter  net income  dropped to
16.6 billion rupees ($374 million) in the three months ended
Sept. 30 from 22.6 billion rupees a year earlier. That lagged
behind the 17.8 billion rupee average of 27 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hindalco fell 1.2 percent to 228.1 rupees, its lowest close
since Nov. 4. Quarterly profit was 4.34 billion rupees, short of
the 5.52 billion rupee average estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Higher costs eroded the result, the
company said in a statement.  Drugmaker  Divi’s Laboratories Ltd.  lost 2.6 percent to
721.7 rupees after saying second-quarter profit declined 15
percent to 719.3 million rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, advanced
2.6 percent to 1,302.5 rupees, extending gains from its highest
level in almost two decades as the global economic recovery and
growing demand in China and the U.S. boosted sales of luxury
vehicles.  Group net income , including Jaguar Land Rover, reached
22.2 billion rupees in the three months through September,
exceeding the 17.1 billion-rupee average estimate of 10 analysts
 compiled  by Bloomberg.  ‘Big Turnaround’  “There is a big turnaround in Tata Motors overseas
operations,” said  K.K. Mital , a New Delhi-based fund manager
with Globe Capital Market Ltd. “We are adding more shares of
Tata Motor’s to our portfolio. As the markets are near their
record, we are booking some profits, too.”  Indian passenger-vehicle sales may surpass a 2.4 million
sales forecast in the year ending March, Vishnu Mathur, director
general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said
today in New Delhi.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , the largest maker
of sport-utility vehicles and tractors, surged 3.2 percent to
806.35 rupees, its highest since at least January 1991.  Apollo Tyres Ltd.  rallied 3.1 percent to 75.2 rupees. The
company may raise prices by as much as 5 percent next month
after the cost of natural rubber climbed, the Business Standard
reported, citing  Satish Sharma , chief of India operations at
Apollo Tyres. Chief Financial Officer Sunam Sarkar couldn’t
immediately be reached at his office telephone for comment on
the report.  JK Tyre & Industries Ltd. gained 4.2 percent to 164.85
rupees.  MRF Ltd.  climbed 1.3 percent to 9,484 rupees.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  7.49 billion rupees  of
Indian equities on Nov. 8, extending this year’s record inflows
to 1.29 trillion rupees, according to data on the  website  of the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
