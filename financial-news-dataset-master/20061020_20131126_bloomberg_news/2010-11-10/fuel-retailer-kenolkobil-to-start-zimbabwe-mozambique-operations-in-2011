KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, said it plans to open an office in Zimbabwe in January
as part of its plan to expand in southern Africa.  The company expects to start “business activities” in
Zimbabwe and Mozambique in 2011, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Nairobi-based company today.  The plan is to acquire and build retail fuel stations for
KenolKobil to operate in the two countries,  Charles Njogu , the
company’s spokesman, said today by phone from Nairobi.  “We have somebody looking into the opportunities and
scouting investments,” Njogu said. “Mozambique can also be
used as an import opportunity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
