Telkom South Africa Ltd. , Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company, said first-half profit plunged
as income from the sale of a stake in  Vodacom Group Ltd.  wasn’t
repeated and it impaired the value of its Nigerian unit again.  Net income fell to 1.01 billion rand ($145 million) in the
six months through September from 39.7 billion rand a year
earlier, as sales dropped 5.4 percent to 17.6 billion rand, the
Pretoria-based company said in a stock-exchange statement today.  Telkom impaired the value of  Multi-Links  by 201 million
rand, after a cut of 2.14 billion rand in the financial year
through March. Last year, a profit of 40.5 billion rand was
reported on sale of a 15 percent stake in Vodacom, the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, to  Vodafone
Group Plc .  South Africa’s telecommunications industry “is becoming
more competitive and the regulatory environment continues to
pose challenges,” Acting Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Hedberg 
said in the statement. “It is imperative Telkom changes the way
it operates in order to defend its revenue and grow into new
revenue streams.”  Voice-traffic revenue in South Africa declined 19 percent
as consumers continued to substitute mobile services for fixed-
line products and following a reduction in the fees that phone
operators charge each other to connect calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
