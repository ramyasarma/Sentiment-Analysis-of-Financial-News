The Pakistan Cricket Board suspended
Zulquarnain Haider’s contract after the wicketkeeper left the
national team during its series against South Africa.  Haider, 24, quit Pakistan’s five-match one-day series
against South Africa and arrived in London two days ago seeking
asylum. His brother Raza Haider said yesterday the player
received death threats from match-fixers and felt “pressure”
from within his own squad. He has retired from the national team
and is seeking legal advice over the asylum claim.  The Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed in a  statement  on its
website that it has suspended Haider’s contract and has opened
an investigation into the matter.  “A fact-finding committee has been formulated to establish
the facts surrounding the incidence of Mr. Haider’s
disappearance from the team hotel,” the ruling body said. “PCB
is trying to get in touch with Mr. Haider but the attempts to
contact him have so far remained unsuccessful.”  Haider told Geo News in Pakistan he received the death
threats “to lose the fourth and fifth one-day internationals
against South Africa, but I could not compromise the dignity of
my country.” The PCB said the player didn’t report any issues
to it.  Haider scored a match-winning 19 not out on Nov. 5 as
Pakistan tied the series with South Africa 2-2. South Africa won
the final game two days ago to take the series, which was played
in Dubai because of security concerns preventing Pakistan from
playing matches at home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
