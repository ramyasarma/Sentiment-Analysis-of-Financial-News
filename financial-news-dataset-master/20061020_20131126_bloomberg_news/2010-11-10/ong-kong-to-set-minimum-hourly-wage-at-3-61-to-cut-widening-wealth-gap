Hong Kong’s government plans to set
the level of hourly minimum wage at HK$28 ($3.61), the first
time it’s imposing limits, as it tries to narrow the widening
wealth gap in the city.  The new statutory minimum wage is expected to take effect
from May 1, 2011, should lawmakers pass the bill next week,
Matthew Cheung, the city’s labor secretary, said today. About
314,600 workers would see wage gains after the new rule come
into effect, he said.  A minimum wage in Hong Kong will help address the biggest
gap between the rich and poor in Asia, as the city joins other
administrations on the continent in trying to contain threats to
social cohesion from rising inequality.  “For some businesses, it may be too high and we will have
to see whether they can raise the price of the products so that
they can pay the minimum wage and maintain the profitability of
companies,” said  Raymond So , professor at the business school
of Hang Seng Management College in Hong Kong.  The number of people living in poverty rose to a record
1.26 million, or about 18.1 percent of the population, in the
first half of 2010, from 1.2 million last year, the Hong Kong
 Council of Social Service , an advisory body to the government,
said in an Oct. 3 report.  “I am disappointed with such a low level of minimum
wage,” said  Leung Yiu Chung , a legislator who represents the
Neighbourhood and Worker’s Service Centre and was calling for an
hourly wage of HK$33. “Before I decide whether to vote for the
proposal, I will negotiate with the government and demand they
raise the bar to a more reasonable level.”  Inflationary Pressures  Rising wages and rents will add to inflationary pressures
in Hong Kong, Financial Secretary John Tsang told lawmakers on
Oct. 28, according to a government transcript.  Hong Kong recorded in 2008 the biggest wealth disparity in
Asia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.53, compared with 0.22 for
Beijing and an average of 0.39 for the region, according to data
compiled by the  United Nations . The coefficient measures
inequality in a range from zero to 1, with zero referring to
total equality.  The median monthly income of the poorest 10 percent of
households was HK$3,000 in the second quarter, unchanged from
2005, charity Oxfam Hong Kong said in a  report  this year. The
income of the richest 10 percent gained 16 percent to HK$80,900,
Oxfam said, citing statistics department data.  The city had per-capita GDP of $29,803 in 2009, trailing
only Japan and Singapore in Asia, according to International
Monetary Fund data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
