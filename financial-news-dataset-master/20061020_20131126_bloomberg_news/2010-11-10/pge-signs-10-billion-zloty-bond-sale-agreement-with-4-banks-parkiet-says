PGE SA, Poland’s largest utility,
has signed an agreement with four banks to manage the sale of 10
billion zloty ($3.53 billion) of unsecured bonds with maturities
of up to three years, the daily Parkiet said today, citing the
company’s Chief Financial Officer Wojciech Topolnicki.  Topolnicki said the funds will be used to help finance
construction of two new generating units at PGE’s Elektrownia
Opole power plant and another unit at Elektrownia Turow, and
also to roll over debt on the company’s expiring two-year bond
program, the newspaper said.  ING Bank will lead-manage the bond program with co-managers
Bank Pekao, Nordea Bank and Italy’s Banco Sviluppo, Parkiet
reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
