The  Bovespa  stock index fell for a
second day, dropping to the lowest level in a week, as
speculation borrowing costs will rise faster than previously
estimated dimmed the outlook for real-estate companies.  Homebuilder  Rossi Residencial SA  lost as much as 5.8
percent, helping the benchmark homebuilders gauge extend the
biggest two-day drop since May, as traders bet on higher
interest rates.  BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of Latin America’s
biggest securities exchange, fell to the lowest price since
September after boosting its operational spending forecast.  The  Bovespa  dropped 0.3 percent to 71,458.62 at 12:47 p.m.
New York time. Thirty-seven stocks fell on the measure while 30
gained. The real weakened 0.6 percent to 1.7113 per dollar.  “You’re seeing a rotation into commodities and out of
companies that depend on credit,” said  Mirela Rappaport , who
manages 150 million reais ($87.7 million) at Investport in Sao
Paulo.  The index pared a decline of as much as 1.1 percent
earlier.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , the iron-ore producer
controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, gained 1.7
percent to 13.93 reais even as the  Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month
Price Commodity Index  slumped 1.7 percent amid concern China
will move to cool its economy.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge yesterday fell the most in
three weeks, led by homebuilders and banks, on concern
quickening inflation will spur the central bank to raise
borrowing costs.  Rate Futures  Today, the yield on the interest-rate futures contract due
in January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, rose to the
highest level since September, increasing three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.53 percent.  Rossi fell 5 percent to 15.30 reais as the  BM&FBovespa Real
Estate Index  slid 2.9 percent for a two-day decline of 6.8
percent, the biggest since May 14.  BM&FBovespa said it boosted its operational spending
forecast for this year to between 540 million reais and 545
million reais, up from 520.3 million reais previously announced.
The company’s profit rose 15 percent to 389.2 million reais,
exceeding the average estimate of 348.6 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of eight analysts. The stock slipped 3 percent
to 13.28 reais today.  Brazil’s smallest banks tumbled after Banco Panamericano
SA’s 2.5 billion-real rescue raised concerns over industry
accounting practices. Panamericano plummeted as much as 36
percent, while rival  Banco Industrial & Comercial SA  fell as
much as 8.5 percent.  The  Bovespa  trades for 11 times analysts’ 2011 earnings
estimates, compared with a ratio of 11.6 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index and 15.4 for Mexico’s IPC, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.1 times the
reported profits of its companies, down from 25.5 times a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
