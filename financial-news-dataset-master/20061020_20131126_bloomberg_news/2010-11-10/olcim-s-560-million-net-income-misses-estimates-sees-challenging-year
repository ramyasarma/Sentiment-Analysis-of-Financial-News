Holcim Ltd. , the world’s second-
biggest cement maker, reported third-quarter profit that fell
short of analysts’ estimates and said reaching last year’s
operating profit will be “challenging.”  Net income fell to 544 million francs ($560.1 million) from
673 million francs a year earlier, the Jona, Switzerland-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted net income of 581.6 million francs. Sales
fell to 5.67 billion francs from 5.69 billion francs.  “The European construction sector made hardly any
progress,” Holcim said in the statement. “Reluctance to invest
on the part of governments, together with declining commercial
and industrial construction activity, muted the demand for
building materials.”  Holcim said profit is still being impacted by a tax charge
tied to an overhaul of operations in North America. The Swiss
company  closed factories  in Spain and the U.S. and trimmed costs
by 857 million francs last year to ride out a building slump in
Europe and North America.  Paris-based Lafarge SA, the world’s largest cement maker,
said on Nov. 5 that it will step up asset sales and pare
investment next year as rising energy costs and sluggish mature
markets prompted profit to fall by 8 percent in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
