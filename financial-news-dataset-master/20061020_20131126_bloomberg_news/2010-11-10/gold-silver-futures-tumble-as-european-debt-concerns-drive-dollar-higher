Gold futures fell the most in a week
as the dollar rebounded, eroding the metal’s appeal as an
alternative asset. Silver had the biggest drop since December
2008.  The greenback climbed for the fourth straight session
against a basket of major currencies after U.S. Treasury yields
rose. Gold has climbed 28 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,424.30 an ounce yesterday, on bets the Federal Reserve’s
stimulus plan would erode the value of the dollar.  “Gold was not cheap, so it’s not surprising that it would
go down with the dollar rallying hard,” said  Leonard Kaplan ,
the president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston,
Illinois.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $10.80, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,399.30 at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Nov.
3.  Silver futures for December delivery plunged $2.041, or 7.1
percent, to $26.865 an ounce, the largest decline since Dec. 1,
2008. Yesterday, the price reached $29.34, a 30-year high.  CME Group Inc.’s Comex unit yesterday raised margin
requirements for trading silver to $6,500 per contract from
$5,000, triggering a slump in precious metals after the close of
floor trading.  “When the exchange raises margin requirements, the nimble
traders are going to try to dump and buy at a lower price,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock in Chicago. “That was a bearish catalyst for the
metals.”  ‘Volatility Jacked Up’  Gold jumped 5.4 percent in the previous four sessions.  “The volatility is jacked up, and the question now is if
the commodity trade is over,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  Yesterday, open interest in gold futures reached a record
666,489 contracts, and volume in silver futures rose to an all-
time high of 201,126 contracts.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium and platinum
prices dropped the most since May 20.  Palladium futures for December delivery tumbled $45.90, or
6.2 percent, to $696.75 an ounce.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $71.70, or 4
percent, to $1,737.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
