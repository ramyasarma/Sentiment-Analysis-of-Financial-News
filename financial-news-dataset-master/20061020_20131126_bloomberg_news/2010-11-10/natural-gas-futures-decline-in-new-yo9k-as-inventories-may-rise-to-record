Natural gas futures pared gains in
New York after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles
rose by more than the five-year average injection for last week.  Gas climbed as much as 2.2 percent. Inventories increased
by 80 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 21 to 3.576
trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department said today. The five-
year average gain for the week is 76 billion.  “The 80 billion injection was a pretty good number,” said
Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at FC Stone LLC in
 St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota . “With mild temperatures ahead, we’re
going to see considerable increases in stocks of natural gas.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 1.3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.228 per million British thermal units at 10:52
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas traded at $3.26
before the storage number was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington . The futures have advanced 8 percent this year.  Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
gain of 78 billion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg users
predicted an increase of 80 billion.  A surplus to the five-year average was unchanged from the
previous week at 8.6 percent, the first time since March that
supplies didn’t drop relative to the average.  Supplies were 9 percent above year-earlier inventories,
compared with 10 percent in last week’s report.  Gas stockpiles may climb to a record 3.95 trillion cubic
feet by the end of October, the Energy Department said Sept. 11
in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Normal Weather  The weather may be mostly normal or cooler-than-normal in
the eastern half of the U.S. from Oct. 7 through Oct. 11,
according to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The high in New York on Oct. 9 may be 61 degrees Fahrenheit
(16 Celsius), 5 below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College , Pennsylvania. The high in  Chicago  may be 62
degrees, 4 less than the usual reading.  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.2 percent and lowered its outlook for prices, the
department said in the Short-Term Energy Outlook. Marketed gas
production will average 68.86 billion cubic feet a day this
year, up from 68.72 billion estimated in August, the report
showed. Output may rise 4 percent from last year’s record 66.22
billion cubic feet.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.65 per million British thermal units, below the
previous forecast of $2.67, the data showed.  The surge in gas production from shale formations helped
the U.S. meet 81 percent of its energy demand in 2011, the most
since 1992, according to department data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shale producers use a technique known as hydraulic fracturing,
or fracking, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals
underground to extract gas embedded in the rock.  The number of rigs drilling for gas rose by six to 454 last
week, according to data released Sept. 21 by Baker Hughes Inc.
in Houston. The rig count is down 44 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
