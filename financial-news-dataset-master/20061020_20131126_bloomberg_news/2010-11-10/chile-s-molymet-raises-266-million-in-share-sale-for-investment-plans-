Molibdenos y Metales SA , the world’s
largest molybdenum processor, raised approximately $266 million
through a sale of new shares today in Santiago, the largest
equity issuance so far this year in Chile.  Molymet, as the company is also known, sold 12.7 million
shares, accounting for 10 percent of the company, at 10,350
pesos each in Santiago. Units of IM Trust and Banco de Chile
handled the transaction, according to a press release
distributed after the pricing.  “Most of the funds raised will be used to finance our
investment plans, with a small portion to fund working
capital,”  John Graell , the company’s chief executive officer,
said in a press conference after the pricing announcement.  Molymet has an investment program of $450 million of which
$225 million correspond to projects that are “in an advanced
stage, but haven’t still been approved by the company’s board,”
Graell said.  The company expects to close before the end of the year the
signing of a joint venture to produce molybdenum in South Korea,
and is also negotiating similar joint ventures in Brazil and the
U.S., Graell told reporters.  Molymet initially planned to sell the shares at a minimum
price of 11,000 pesos each, but preferred to lower the price of
the shares as a way to ensure a more diversified group of new
shareholders, Graell said. The offering was approximately 10
times oversubscribed, he said.  “It is great to have an additional liquid metal play in
Chile for the biggest placement since Cencosud SA,”  Eric Conrads , who helps manage about $1 billion in emerging-market
funds at ING Investment Management in New York, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. “The diversified base of
shareholders is a good decision to ensure visibility and
liquidity.”  Molymet fell 9.6 percent to 10,840 pesos at 11:31 a.m. New
York time. The IPSA Index dropped 0.3 percent to 5,010.08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
