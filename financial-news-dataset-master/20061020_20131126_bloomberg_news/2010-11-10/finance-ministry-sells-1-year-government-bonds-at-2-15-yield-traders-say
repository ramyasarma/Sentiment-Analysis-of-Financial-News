China’s finance ministry sold 28
billion yuan ($4.2 billion) in one-year bonds at an average

(China) Ltd. and Industrial Bank Co.  The highest winning-bid yield at the sale was 2.21 percent,
said the traders at the primary dealers required to bid at the
government auctions. The issuance drew bids 1.5 times the amount
on offer, according to the traders.  The average yield at today’s auction was 3 basis points
higher than the 2.12 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
