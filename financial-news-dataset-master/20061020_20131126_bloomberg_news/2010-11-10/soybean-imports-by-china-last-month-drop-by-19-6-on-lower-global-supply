Soybean imports by China, the
biggest consumer, fell 19.6 percent in October from the previous
month on a seasonal decline in global supply.  Imports were 3.73 million metric tons compared with 4.64
million tons in September, according to customs data released
today. Shipments gained 48 percent from the same time last year
and imports in  January to October  climbed 26 percent to 43.9
million tons, customs said.  Soybean futures in Chicago yesterday jumped to the highest
since August 2008, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
lowered its estimate on stockpiles in the nation and around the
world, on higher import demand from China and the E.U. China’s
imports in the year that began Oct. 1 may gain 13 percent to 57
million tons, USDA said yesterday, increasing last month’s
projection by 2 million tons.  “We’ll likely see higher volumes coming in around December
given large prior purchases” made in the last two months, Zhou
Youjin, director of research at Tianqi Futures Co., said by
phone from Shenzhen. Seasonally,  imports  decline in October as
supply is less available, he said.  Rising domestic stockpiles indicate the market is at risk
of oversupply, which can lead to slower sales of processed
products including meal and oil, Zhou said. “There will be
short-term adjustments even though I’m bullish on the
longterm.”  Vegetable oils imports by China in the first 10 months
declined 19 percent from a year ago to 5.5 million tons, customs
data show. Imports in October were 530,000 tons, compared with
640,000 tons in September, data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
