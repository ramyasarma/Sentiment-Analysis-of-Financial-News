Platinum may climb to the record
reached in 2008 as chart patterns signal a further advance,
according to technical analysis from Barclays Capital.  “We were impressed by the rally to a new 2010 high last
week and even more so in the light of further gains this week,
which have extended beyond a retracement level at $1,782” an
ounce, according to the Barclays report dated Nov. 9. “These
signals suggest the risk will be that the rally extends to
Fibonacci resistance at $1,969 and next year possibly all the
way to the 2008 high.”  Platinum for immediate delivery increased as much as 2
percent to $1,808.50 an ounce yesterday, the highest level since
July 2008, and traded at $1,765.50 today. The metal, used in
auto catalytic converters and jewelry, has underperformed other
precious metals this year as production outpaced demand. It
reached an intraday record of $2,301.50 an ounce on March 4,
2008. Platinum jewelry demand could be supported by high gold
prices, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. analysts including London-
based  Paul Galloway  wrote in an Oct. 29 report.  “Near term, the main obstacle to further gains is the
$1,830-$1,845 zone, which marked the cliff edge back in 2008,”
the report said. “A close above that zone would be an important
marker that suggests platinum is making up for lost time.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
