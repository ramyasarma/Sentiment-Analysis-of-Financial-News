Turkey won’t increase the prices it
guarantees to buy alternative energy in draft legislation that’s
before parliament, Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said.  The renewable energy law’s progress through the assembly
has been delayed until after a week-long religious holiday next
week, and the postponement doesn’t mean there’ll be a revision,
Yildiz said yesterday in comments confirmed today by his staff.  The draft guarantees a price of 5.5 euro cents (7 U.S.
cents) per kilowatt-hour for wind and hydroelectric power and 10
cents for solar energy, Yildiz said. Companies are already
investing in wind power at those levels and they’re “investable
figures,” he said in Ankara.  Turkey is seeking to reduce its dependence on imported gas
from Russia and Iran by encouraging alternative energy
production. Excluding energy, the country’s  current-account  last
year produced a surplus of 0.5 percent of gross domestic
product, according to the Treasury. Including energy, the
deficit was 2.3 percent of GDP.  The price for wind energy should be at least 7.5 euro cents
to justify investment,  Mete Maltepe , head of General Electric
Co.’s unit in Turkey, said yesterday in an interview.  Potential investors are lobbying lawmakers for prices of 7
cents for wind energy and 20 cents for solar.  Solar energy is a developing technology and the price
Turkey’s setting marks a “starting point” and could be revised
as the industry develops, Yildiz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
