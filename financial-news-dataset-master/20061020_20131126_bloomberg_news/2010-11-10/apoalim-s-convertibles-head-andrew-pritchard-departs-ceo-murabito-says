Andrew Pritchard, hired three months
ago by Hapoalim Securities USA Inc. to start an institutional
convertible bonds sales and trading business, has left the firm.  Pritchard departed from the unit of Israel’s Bank Hapoalim
today, Chief Executive Officer John Murabito said in a telephone
interview.  “We continue to be very much in the convertibles business
and are committed to it,” said Murabito, declining further
commment.  Kimberlee Brody, who joined Hapoalim in August as a
managing director in the convertibles business, left today as
well, Murabito said.  Pritchard and Brody, both of whom were based in New York,
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Pritchard previously was the head of convertible bonds and
structured products at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, according to an
Aug. 10 statement from the U.S. broker-dealer of Israel’s
largest bank. Brody previously worked at BNP Paribas and Merrill
Lynch & Co., according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
