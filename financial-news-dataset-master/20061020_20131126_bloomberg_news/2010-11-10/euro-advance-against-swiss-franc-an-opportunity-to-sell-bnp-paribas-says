Investors should use the euro’s gain
against the Swiss franc as an opportunity to sell it as the
sovereign-debt crisis will force the European Central Bank to
delay its exit from stimulus measures, BNP Paribas SA said.  “Peripheral concern will remain a top theme with deposit
shifts into Swiss bank accounts supporting the franc,” BNP
analysts led by Hans-Guenter Redeker , global head of currency
strategy in London, wrote in a client note today. “The sharp
bond spread widening will make it difficult for the ECB to
implement its money-market normalization strategy.”  The franc’s gain to around 1.3410 was “a renewed selling
opportunity,” the analysts wrote. The euro rose 0.4 percent to
1.3387 francs as of 9:36 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
