LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA
began buying swap contracts underpinned by Hermes International
SCA stock in early 2008 as a hedge against the financial crisis,
LVMH vice president Pierre Gode told French daily Les Echos in
an interview.  LVMH didn’t plan to acquire Hermes stock via the contracts
at the time of purchase, Gode told Les Echos. The company has
acted within the letter and the spirit of financial regulations,
Gode added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
