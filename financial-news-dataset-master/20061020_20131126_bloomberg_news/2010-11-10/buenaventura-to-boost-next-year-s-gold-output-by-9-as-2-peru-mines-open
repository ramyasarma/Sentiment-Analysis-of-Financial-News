Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, aims to boost gold
production by 9 percent next year after starting up two mines,
Chief Financial Officer  Carlos Galvez  said.  Buenaventura plans to produce 1.2 million ounces in 2011
with the startup of its La Zanja and Tantahuatay gold mines,
Galvez said today in an interview in Lima. The Yanacocha gold
mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 44 percent stake, is slated
to match this year’s output of 1.5 million ounces, he said.  The company is seeking cost cuts from expanded operations,
Galvez said. “That will make us more competitive,” he said.  Buenaventura and South African partner  Gold Fields Ltd. 
will make a decision on whether to develop the Chucapaca gold
deposit in the first half of 2011, Galvez said.  Phoenix-based  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  may
decide next year to triple output at the Cerro Verde copper
mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 19 percent stake, he said.  La Zanja, which produced its first gold bar in September,
will have output of 100,000 ounces next year, he said. The
Tantahuatay gold and copper mine, a joint venture with Phoenix-
based  Southern Copper Corp. , will start producing in the second
half of 2011 to tap surging gold prices, Galvez said.  Record Prices  Before today, gold climbed 29 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,424.30 an ounce yesterday. Gold futures for December
delivery fell $15.60, or 1.1 percent, to $1,394.50 at 12:14 p.m.
on the Comex in New York.  Cerro Verde and Yanacocha, Latin America’s largest gold
mine, will be “major contributors” to earnings next year,
Galvez said. Yanacocha is 56 percent controlled by  Newmont
Mining Corp. , the largest U.S. gold producer.  Buenaventura’s  American depositary receipts  rose $1.60, or
3 percent, to $55 at 1:59 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has climbed 65 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
