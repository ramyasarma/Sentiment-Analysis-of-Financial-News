Henkel AG  rose the most in more than
20 months in Frankfurt trading as the German maker of Loctite
glues and Persil detergent said third-quarter profit almost
doubled and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast.  Henkel’s preferred stock jumped as much as 7.9 percent to
45.38 euros, the  biggest  intraday increase since Feb. 25, 2009,
and was up 7.2 percent as of 10:03 a.m., leading gains in
Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index .  Net income  rose 96 percent from a
year earlier to 337 million euros ($466 million), the
Dusseldorf-based manufacturer said today in a  statement .  Almost half of Henkel’s revenue comes from industrial
adhesives, where demand is increasing as manufacturers recover
from the global recession. The IVK adhesive-maker association in
Germany has forecast a 6 percent industrywide increase in sales
this year, driven by exports. Henkel said today that earnings
per preferred share will rise by more than 45 percent this year
compared with a forecast of more than 25 percent growth.  “Henkel benefits a lot from the recovery in the car and
electronics industry,” said  Martina Noss , an analyst at
Norddeutsche Landesbank in Hanover, Germany, with a “hold”
 recommendation  on the stock.  The increase in the EPS forecast was the third this year.
Henkel, the world’s biggest maker of adhesives, also said that
earnings before interest and taxes as a proportion of sales will
be “well above” 12 percent this year after reaching 11.8
percent in the first nine months. The company has targeted a
14 percent margin by 2012.  “I am confident that we will also reach this target,”
Chief Executive Officer  Kasper Rorsted  said in a  video  on the
company’s website.  Adhesives Unit’s Earnings  Ebit at the adhesives division tripled in the quarter to
268 million euros, while revenue increased 19 percent to 1.95
billion euros.  “The prospect of record-beating returns in 2010 set the
stage for Henkel to achieve its 2012 goal of 14 percent Ebit
margins,”  Simon Marshall-Lockyer , an analyst at Jeffries
International Ltd. in London with a “hold” recommendation,
said in a report to clients. “Significant market-share gains in
a ferociously competitive environment are tribute to the root-
and-branch improvement of the group under  Kasper Rorsted ’s
stewardship.”  Laundry-division profit increased 1.5 percent to 139
million euros as sales rose 8.5 percent. Ebit at the beauty-
products unit, which makes cosmetics and toiletry items, rose 14
percent to 113 million euros, with revenue gaining 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
