A proposed ban on industrial-gas
offsets in the European Union carbon program probably wouldn’t
undermine the market because it’s oversupplied, a trader at RWE
AG said today at a conference in London.   “There will be enough Certified Emission Reductions
available for meeting the absorption capacity of the EU
emissions trading system,” Bjorn Struck, senior emissions
portfolio manager at the trading unit of RWE, Germany’s second-
biggest utility, said at the Climate Finance 2010 conference.
“I don’t think the restrictions will affect the EU ETS a lot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
