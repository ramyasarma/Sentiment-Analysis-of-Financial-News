Moscow Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin 
unveiled a five-year plan to fight traffic jams ranked the worst
in the world.  A set of  proposals  released today, which are due to be
approved in the next month, would place restrictions on long-
haul trucks entering the Moscow region from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on
weekdays. Sobyanin also seeks to remove trolleybuses from the
city center.  Moscow drivers suffer the longest traffic jams of the
world’s 20 major cities, and the average motorist spent 2 1/2
hours stuck in traffic at least once in the last three years,
International Business Machines Corp. said in a study in July.
More than 40 percent of Moscow drivers reported sitting in jams
for more than 3 hours, three times the survey average, IBM said.  President  Dmitry Medvedev , who is seeking to transform
Moscow into an international financial center, last month told
Sobyanin that one of his main tasks would be dealing with
worsening traffic. “Everyone talks about it; it is very
difficult to move around in Moscow,” Medvedev said.  The plan also calls for increasing parking spaces, which
now meet 30 percent of needed capacity, creating a system for
issuing parking tickets and building more roads.  The administration of former Mayor  Yury Luzhkov  proposed
charging motorists a congestion fee to drive in the city center.
While this measure was not included in the new plan, it
suggested levying a payment for use of certain roads which would
vary depending on congestion levels.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
