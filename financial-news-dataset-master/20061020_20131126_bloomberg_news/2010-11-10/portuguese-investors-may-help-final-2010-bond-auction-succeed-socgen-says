Domestic investors are likely to
participate in Portugal’s sale of bonds due in October 2016 and
June 2020 after yields rose, helping the government succeed with
its final sale of the year, Societe Generale SA said.  “Portuguese government bonds are the bonds in Europe,
after Austria, with the lowest domestic ownership,” Ciaran O’Hagan  and  Aro Razafindrakola , fixed-income strategists in
Paris, wrote in an investor note dated yesterday. “There is
scope for this to be increased, with better final investor
interest on the 2020 given its high yield.”  The debt agency may decide to sell less than 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) of securities at the sale, less than the
maximum of 1.25 billion euros, because it “doubtless wants to
signal its presence in the market” and “doesn’t need the cash
right now,” the analysts wrote.  The yield on Portuguese bonds due in June 2020 was 6.92
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
