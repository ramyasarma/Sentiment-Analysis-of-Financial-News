The European Union should consider
accelerating sales of carbon permits in auctions from March
through May starting in 2013 to accommodate utilities’ need to
hedge forward power sales, an analyst at IDEAcarbon said.  “That’s something that the regulators will have to take
into account if they want to avoid a price spike,” Alessandro
Vitelli, an carbon-market analyst at IDEAcarbon, said today at
the Climate Finance 2010 conference in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
