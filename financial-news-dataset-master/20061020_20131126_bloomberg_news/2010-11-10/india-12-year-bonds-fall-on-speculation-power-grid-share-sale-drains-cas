India’s 12-year bonds fell on
speculation investors have less cash to buy debt after a share
sale by the nation’s biggest power-transmission company by sales
drained funds from the banking system.  Power Grid Corp. of India received bids for 1.08 times the
stock on offer as of yesterday, the first day of its share sale,
according to the National Stock Exchange’s website. The yield on
the most-traded 2022 security rose to the highest level in more
than a week as banks, the biggest buyers of government debt,
have depended on the central bank for daily funds since Sept. 9.
They borrowed 1 trillion rupees ($22.5 billion) on average every
day this week, compared with 629 billion rupees last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The share sale has added to the ongoing cash crunch and
has weakened demand for securities,” said  Roy Paul , deputy
general manager at Mumbai-based Federal Bank Ltd. “Bond yields
will remain under pressure to rise because the liquidity
situation may not improve anytime soon.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.03 percent as
of 11:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The price fell 12 paise, or 0.12 per 100 rupee face
amount, to 100.73.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates,
increased to 6.69 percent from 6.67 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
