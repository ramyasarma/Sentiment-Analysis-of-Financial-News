Chinese insurance companies will be
allowed to invest in Canada through their wealth management
operations, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said.  The agreement with China gives Canadian financial markets
access to a pool of up to C$106 billion ($106 billion), Flaherty
said in a statement today from Seoul, South Korea.  “This agreement demonstrates a great deal of confidence in
Canada’s economic prospects and the soundness of Canada’s
financial system,” he said in the  statement .  Canada had been approved in April as a place where Chinese
banks could invest. Today’s agreement is the third under China’s
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor program, which is run
by China’s regulators for banking, insurance and securities,
Flaherty said in the statement.  “The agreement comes at an ideal time as G-20 countries
meet to discuss, among other issues, the need to promote trade
and investment,” the statement posted on Canadian finance
department’s website said. The leaders of the Group of 20
nations meet this week in Seoul.  In a separate release, eight members of the Canadian
Securities Administrators said they have signed an agreement
with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to cooperate on
regulations governing investments by Chinese insurance firms in
Canada.  Foreigners bought a record  amount  of Canadian securities
last year. Canada was first among Group of Seven nations to
emerge from a global recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
