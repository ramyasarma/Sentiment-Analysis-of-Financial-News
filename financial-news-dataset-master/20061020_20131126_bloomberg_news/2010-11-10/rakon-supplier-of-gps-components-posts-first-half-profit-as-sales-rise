Rakon Ltd. , a New Zealand-based
supplier of crystal oscillators for global positioning systems,
posted a first-half profit after sales and market share rose.  Net income totaled NZ$5.6 million ($4.4 million) in the six
months ended Sept. 30 compared with a NZ$6.2 million loss in the
same period a year ago, the Auckland-based company said in a
statement. Sales gained 31 percent to NZ$94.6 million.  Rakon is expanding production in response to demand for
oscillators which are used in smartphones and are a key
component of femtocells, used by companies such as  Vodafone
Group Plc  and AT&T Inc. to improve mobile network coverage. The
company will open a new plant in Chengdu in mid-2011 while its
plants in India and the U.K. have doubled capacity.  The first-half result extends a recovery from 12 months ago
when sales were hit by the global financial crisis, Chief
Executive Officer  Brent Robinson  said in the statement.  The company is well-positioned in all markets and is
comfortable with analysts’ estimates that operating profit, or
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
will be NZ$25 million to NZ$30 million in the year ending March
31, he said.  Operating profit was NZ$13.5 million in the first half and
NZ$4.3 million in the year ended March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
