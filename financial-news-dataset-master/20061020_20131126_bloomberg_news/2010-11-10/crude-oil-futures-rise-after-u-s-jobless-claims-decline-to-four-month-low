Crude oil rose to a two-year high
after a report showed an unexpected decrease in inventories as
imports declined and refineries bolstered operating rates.  Oil climbed 1.3 percent as  supplies  dropped 3.27 million
barrels to 364.9 million last week, the Energy Department said.
Stockpiles were forecast to increase 1.5 million barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Inventories of gasoline
and  distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, fell more than estimated.  “This is a wildly bullish report with draws across the
board,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy-research firm. “The crude
number came as a surprise. The combination of a big increase in
utilization and a drop in imports engendered a substantial
decline in stocks.”  Crude oil for December delivery increased $1.09 to $87.81 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Oct. 8, 2008. Futures are up 11 percent from a
year ago.  Brent crude oil for December settlement rose 63 cents, or
0.7 percent, to end the session at $88.96 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest
settlement since Oct. 3, 2008.  Crude  inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York futures, dropped 1.75 million barrels to 31.8
million, the biggest decline since the week ended Sept. 11,
2009. The decrease left stockpiles at the lowest level since the
week ended April 2.  Refineries  operated  at 82.4 percent of capacity, up 0.6
percentage point from the previous week, the report showed.
Crude-oil imports tumbled 5.7 percent to 8.09 million barrels a
day, the lowest level since January.  Fuel Inventories  Supplies of distillate fuel  fell 4.97 million barrels to
159.9 million last week, the seventh straight decline, according
to the department. It was the biggest drop since February 2007.
Inventories were forecast to slip 2 million barrels, according
to the median of 15 analyst estimates in the Bloomberg survey.  Consumption  of distillate fuel  surged 7 percent to 4.39
million barrels a day, the highest level since August 2008, the
report showed. Demand in the week ended Nov. 5 was up 24 percent
from a year earlier.  “The large jump in distillate demand year-on-year will
bear watching,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York-based hedge fund focusing on energy. “This
could be an emerging trend that signals not only heating demand
but also an uptick in economic activity.”  Gasoline Inventories  Gasoline stockpiles  dropped 1.92 million barrels to 210.3
million, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 20, 2009. A
1 million-barrel fall was projected.  “There are fundamental reasons for today’s rise” in
prices, said  Stephen Schork , president of consultant Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “The gasoline and
distillate supply declines have been massive.”  Gasoline for December delivery climbed 5.12 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.2362 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since May 4.  Heating oil increased 3.52 cents, or 1.5 percent, to end
the session at $2.4419 a gallon. It was the highest settlement
price since Oct. 8, 2008.  Prices also rose after the number of Americans filing
initial jobless claims declined, bolstering optimism that the
U.S. economic rebound will accelerate. The Labor Department said
applications for  jobless benefits  dropped by 24,000 to 435,000,
the lowest level in four months.  The number of people asking for assistance was projected to
fall to 450,000, according to the median forecast of 46
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Goldman Sachs Projection  Global economic growth will drive oil demand and reduce
inventories, which are still “exceptionally high” in developed
countries including the U.S., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a
report dated yesterday.  Spare capacity held by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will decline as the 12-member group, which
pumps 40 percent of the world’s oil, boosts supply to meet
demand, the bank said.  “Despite the recent rally, we believe that forward price
levels offer good hedging opportunities,” Goldman analysts, led
by  Allison Nathan  in New York, said in the report. “We continue
to expect improving fundamentals will provide additional support
to prices.”  $90 Oil  The next target for the December oil contract is $88.33,
which is close to a 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
range generated by this year’s high of $93.55 on May 3 and a low
of $71.50, Schork said.  “Once we break through the retracement the market will
soon head to $90,” Schork said. “The bulls have been
anticipating the moment.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 808,811 contracts as of 3:15
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 685,832
contracts yesterday, 2.6 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.49 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
