Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, recommended buying
contracts of European gasoil for settlement in January 2011 on
the basis that diesel shortages in China will continue.  Chinese supplies of diesel, a category of fuel that
includes gasoil, will be restricted until the end of this year
as a result of Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s five-year plan to reduce
energy consumption, Goldman said. China’s policy of cutting
electricity supplies in order to reach the target has led some
consumers to boost power production from diesel-fired
generators, according to the bank.  “We expect China to export significantly less diesel and
start to import once again,” analysts led by  David Greely  in
New York said in a report today. “We expect this to tighten the
gasoil market, making it the leading edge of the oil complex.”  Gasoil for January delivery was last at $754.50 a ton on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange, having advanced 4.7 percent in
the past month.  Goldman closed a separate recommendation to buy December
contracts of crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The bank
said the trade, first suggested on Feb. 5, would have given a
profit of $8.97 a barrel, or 11.5 percent, to investors. Futures
for December delivery last traded at $86.34 a barrel as of 11:16
a.m. London time.  Oil prices will be “substantially higher” by 2012 as the
global stockpile surplus shrinks and excess production capacity
drops, Goldman said in a note dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
