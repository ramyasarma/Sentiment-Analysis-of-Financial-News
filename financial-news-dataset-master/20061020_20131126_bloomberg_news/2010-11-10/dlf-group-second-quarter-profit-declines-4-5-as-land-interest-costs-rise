DLF Ltd ., India’s biggest developer,
said second-quarter profit fell 4.5 percent as interest costs
and expenditure on acquiring land increased.  Net income  dropped to 4.2 billion rupees ($95 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 4.4 billion rupees a year
earlier, the New Delhi-based developer said today. That’s lower
than the 4.38 billion rupee  average  of 23 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales rose 35 percent to 23.7 billion rupees from a year
earlier, the company said. That compared with the 21 billion
rupee average of 25 estimates. Cost of land and development
rights more than doubled to 8.1 billion rupees and finance
charges rose 74 percent to 4.3 billion rupees in the quarter
from a year earlier.  The central bank, which raised interest rates six times
this year, said on Nov. 2 it plans to cap loan-to-value ratios
at 80 percent, raise the risk weighting on larger housing loans
and increase some provisioning requirements.  Shares  of DLF have gained 0.4 percent this year, compared
with a 20 percent gain in the benchmark stock index. The shares
fell 0.1 percent to 362.7 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of
trading in Mumbai today. The earnings were announced after
market hours.  The company is “concerned” with increases in prices of
commodities which could raise construction costs, it said in a
statement. DLF sold assets not related to their business for
4.13 billion rupees in the quarter, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
