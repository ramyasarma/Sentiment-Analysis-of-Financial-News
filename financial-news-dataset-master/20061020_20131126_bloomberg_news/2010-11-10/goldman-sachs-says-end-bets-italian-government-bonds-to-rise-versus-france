Investors should end bets that
Italian 10-year government bonds will rise relative to
equivalent-maturity French debt after the yield spread between
the two securities widened.  “Sovereign spreads will, in our view, remain volatile into
year-end, and the risk-reward of our recommended trade to be
long 10-year Italy versus France has diminished,” Francesco Garzarelli , chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman Sachs in
London. “We would now recommend closing this position, looking
to explore opportunities in the same direction at a later
stage.”  The Italian-French 10-year  yield spread  was at 115 basis
points as of 12:35 p.m. in London, compared with 117 basis
points when Goldman initiated the trade on Sept. 3. The spread
narrowed to 95 basis points on Oct. 26.     To contact the reporter on this story:
