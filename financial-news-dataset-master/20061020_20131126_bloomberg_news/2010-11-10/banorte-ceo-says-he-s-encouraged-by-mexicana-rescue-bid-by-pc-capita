Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, the
biggest holder of bankrupt Grupo Mexicana de Aviacion SA’s debt,
is “encouraged” by PC Capital SAPI’s offer to rescue the
airline, Chief Executive Officer Alejandro Valenzuela said.  Banorte has provisioned 800 million pesos ($65.4 million)
of Mexicana’s debt and would consider converting that to capital
in the airline, Valenzuela said today in an interview at the
Bloomberg Mexico Economic Summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
