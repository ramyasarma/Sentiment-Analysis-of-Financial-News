Copper futures in London fell for
the first day in five, declining from near a record as China’s
imports of the metal slumped and on speculation that the Chinese
government will step up measures to rein in asset prices.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
was 1.3 percent lower at $8,753 a metric ton at 11:52 a.m. in
Singapore after earlier falling to $8,740.50. The contract
reached $8,884 a ton yesterday, the highest level since July
2008, when it reached an all-time high of $8,940.  “The drop in imports was expected as it was unprofitable
to ship metal into China,” said  Fang Junfeng , an analyst at
China International Futures (Shanghai) Co. Traders are “nervous
today ahead of the CPI number tomorrow and what the government
will do to next to fight rising prices,” referring to the
consumer price index by its initials.  December-delivery copper on the Comex in New York fell as
much as 1.6 percent to $3.9780 a pound, while Shanghai futures
dropped as much as 1.1 percent to 67,250 yuan ($10,131) a ton.  China imported 273,511 tons of copper and products in
October, the customs office said today. This is 26 percent less
than the previous month and 4 percent lower than October 2009.
Government data due for release tomorrow will show the inflation
rate rose 4 percent in October, according to the median estimate
of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the
highest in two years.  China’s property sales climbed for a third month in October,
according to the statistics bureau today, even as prices rose
8.6 percent from a year earlier, adding to speculation that the
government will step up measures to cool the market.  “We’ll see some pullbacks along the way as it’s hard to
justify these levels fundamentally,” said Yan Lei, an analyst
at Guoyuan Securities Co., referring to copper. “The rally is
driven by investment and speculative demand, which has increased
because of the enormous amount of liquidity.”  Aluminum in London fell 0.8 percent to $2,450 a ton, zinc
dropped 2.3 percent to $2,520 a ton, and lead declined 1.3
percent to $2,574.25 a ton. Nickel decreased 1.5 percent to
$24,250 a ton, and tin slipped 1.1 percent to $27,050 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
