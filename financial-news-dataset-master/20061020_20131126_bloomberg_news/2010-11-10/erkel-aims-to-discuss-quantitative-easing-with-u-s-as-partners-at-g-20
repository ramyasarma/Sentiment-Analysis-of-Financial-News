German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
that she will take up U.S. moves on quantitative easing with
President Barack Obama at a Group of 20 summit in South Korea
beginning tomorrow.  Merkel will address the issue with the U.S. “in a spirit
of partnership,” she told reporters in Berlin today before
leaving for Seoul. There’s a need to ensure that there are “no
new asset bubbles” that threaten the return to self-sustaining
economic growth, she said.  The U.S. Federal Reserve last week announced plans to buy
$600 billion of long-term government bonds in its second effort
at so-called quantitative easing, or QE2, aiming to stoke U.S.
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
