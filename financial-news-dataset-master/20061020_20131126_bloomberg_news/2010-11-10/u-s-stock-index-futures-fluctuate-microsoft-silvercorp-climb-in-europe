U.S.  stocks  advanced, ending two
days of declines, as a rally in oil prices boosted energy shares
and Ireland’s central bank governor said the country may return
to bond markets next year, easing concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will worsen.  Chevron Corp. gained 1.9 percent as oil reached a two-year
high following an Energy Department report showing an unexpected
decrease in crude stockpiles. Bank of America Corp. rose 2.4
percent, leading financial shares higher. Ford Motor Co. rallied
3.5 percent as the automaker held its lead as the top-earning
car manufacturer. Boeing Co. slid 3.2 percent, weighing on the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, after suspending test flights of
the 787 Dreamliner jet.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.4 percent to
1,218.71 at 4:17 p.m. in New York, recovering from a 0.8 percent
loss. The  Dow  climbed 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,357.04.
Benchmark indexes reached two-yeah highs last week after the
Federal Reserve expanded its program of asset purchases to
stimulate growth, a tactic known as quantitative easing.  “Currency traders have reversed bets on the sovereign debt
fears, and you see that translating into a weakening dollar and
stronger equity markets,” said  Michael James,  a managing
director at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
“Ireland’s been the focus of sovereign debt concerns over the
last weeks, but the market seems to be weathering those fears.”  The Dollar Index pared gains, rising 0.2 percent to 77.62,
after earlier advancing as much as 0.9 percent. Earlier declines
in stocks today came as Irish 10-year bonds tumbled for a 12th
day, the longest slump since at least 2007. Irish bonds have
plunged on concern the cost of bailing out the nation’s banks
has made the government debt load unsustainable.  Governor Honohan  Irish central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said he’s
convinced the country will be able to return to bond markets in
2011 as the government steps up austerity measures to lower the
budget deficit and restore investor confidence.  “There is no reason why Ireland shouldn’t be able to go
back to bond markets next year,” Honohan, who also sits on the
European Central Bank’s 22-member Governing Council, told
Bloomberg Television in an interview in Dublin today. “It takes
time for markets to be reassured. It takes more than calming
words from me or others.”  U.S. futures fell earlier as China’s central bank raised
lenders’ reserve requirements as cash from October’s larger-
than-forecast $27.1 billion trade surplus threatened to add to
the risk of asset bubbles and accelerating inflation. The step
came a day before the G20 nations meet in Seoul to tackle global
imbalances.  ‘QE2 Backlash’  “It’s a mix of issues -- the European situation, China,
there’s a little bit of backlash to QE2,” said  Michael Nasto ,
senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which manages about
$2.5 billion in San Antonio, Texas. “People are waiting to find
out what’s going to happen at the G20 meeting later this week.
Energy’s leading because the Department of Energy inventory
numbers were all pretty much bullish.”  Bank of America jumped 2.4 percent to $12.57, the biggest
gain in the Dow. Financial stocks rallied 1.4 percent, the most
 out of 10  S&P 500 groups. JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 1.8 percent
to $40.62, while Citigroup Inc. gained 2.8 percent to $4.42.  Chevron rose 1.9 percent to $85.17, leading energy stocks
to the second-biggest gain among 10 industries in the S&P 500.
 Oil  for December delivery surged $1.09 to $87.81 as supplies
dropped 3.27 million barrels to 364.9 million last week, the
Energy Department said. Stockpiles were forecast to increase 1.5
million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, fell more than estimated.  Ford Jumps  Ford rose 3.5 percent to $16.63, an almost seven-year high.
Rival General Motors Co. reported third-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes rose to $2.28 billion from $2.03 billion
during the previous three months of the year, lagging behind
Ford as the most profitable automaker this year, while
overtaking Toyota Motor Corp.  Boeing declined 3.2 percent to $67.07, the largest drop
since Aug. 24. The world’s largest aerospace company suspended
test flights of the 787 Dreamliner jet while it investigates why
one of the planes caught fire and had to make an emergency
landing in Texas. The company was removed from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.’s “conviction buy” list.  Campbell Soup Co. dropped 3.3 percent, the most in 18
months, to $34.85 as the world’s largest soup maker cut its
full-year forecast. Per-share earnings for the year ending July
will climb 2 percent to 4 percent, Campbell said today in a
statement. That compared with a previous  forecast  of 5 percent
to 7 percent.  Invesco  Ltd. fell 3.9 percent to $22.29. Morgan Stanley,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, divested a stake in
Invesco for $664 million, just five months after acquiring it
through the sale of a retail asset-management unit.  Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. rallied 7.3 percent to $108.28, the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The New York-based seller of the
namesake brand clothing raised its sales projection for the year
as customers snapped up footwear and apparel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
