Soybean  output in Brazil’s biggest
producing state will remain unchanged next year, the first time
it will fail to rise since 2007, after dryness delayed planting
and prompted farmers to favor cotton, a producers group said.  Mato Grosso state, which grows about 30 percent of Brazil’s
soybeans, will harvest about 18.8 million metric tons of the
oilseed next year, the same as this year, Glauber Silveira
Silva, head of the  Mato Grosso Soybean Producers Association ,
said in an interview yesterday in Brasilia.  Some farmers gave up growing soybeans in Mato Grosso this
year to plant cotton after the plumage used to make clothes rose
to record prices and dryness hindered soybean planting, Silva
said. Soybean growers delayed planting to wait for a late rainy
season to ensure a proper development of the plants, Silva said.  Cotton futures advanced to a record in New York today after
the U.S. government cut global output forecasts. The March-
delivery contract gained as much as 3.3 percent to $1.5195 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York and traded at $1.4807 at
8:45 a.m. Futures have doubled this year, making cotton the best
performer among 19 commodities on the UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index.  The Mato Grosso Agricultural Research Institute, known as
Imea, estimates soybean production will drop to 18.4 million
tons next year, compared with 18.8 million tons this year and
17.4 million tons in 2009.  Brazil is the world’s largest soybean grower after the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
