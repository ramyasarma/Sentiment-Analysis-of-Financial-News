Argentine lawmakers began to debate
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s 2011 budget bill,
which includes the tapping of $7.5 billion in central bank
 reserves  to pay debt.  The ruling coalition, which last year lost its majority in
the lower house, is seeking approval of the bill envisaging
4.3 percent growth of South America’s second-biggest economy
 growing  and  consumer prices  rising by 8.9 percent.  Adrian Perez, a lawmaker for the Civic Coalition, said the
budget figures aren’t realistic and that opposition blocs will
seek modifications.  “This budget proposal is wrong, it gives the government
about 40 billion pesos ($10.1 billion) in excess revenue and
foresees inflation and growth rates that are inaccurate,” Perez
said to reporters before the session. “As it is, we can’t
approve it. We want to have a reasonable budget.”  The plan to use $7.5 billion in central bank reserves to
pay next year’s debt will fuel inflation as the bank prints
pesos to buy dollars,  Alfonso Prat-Gay , an opposition lawmaker
and former central bank president, said in September, when the
bill was unveiled.  This year, the government plans to use as much as
$6.6 billion out of a record high $52.3 billion in reserves to
pay debt, a move that Prat-Gay says has caused annual inflation
to accelerate to 25 percent.  Fernandez plans an overall budget surplus of 0.13 percent
of gross domestic product, according to the budget document. It
also forecasts that the surplus before interest payments will be
2.46 percent of GDP and that the peso will fall to 4.1 per
dollar next year from 3.9627 at 11:50 New York time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
