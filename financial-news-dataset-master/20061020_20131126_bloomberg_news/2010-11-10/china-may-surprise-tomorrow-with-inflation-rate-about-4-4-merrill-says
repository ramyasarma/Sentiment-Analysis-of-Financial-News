China’s October inflation rate may
“surprise on the upside” by accelerating to “around 4.4
percent,” Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in an e-mailed
note today.  The data is due tomorrow. October’s new lending may also
top estimates by being close to 600 billion yuan, said Hong
Kong-based economist Lu Ting.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists is for October’s inflation rate to hit a two-year
high of 4 percent.  Lu’s comments were in a note after reports that China’s
central bank has told some banks to set aside more money as
reserves, draining cash from the fastest-growing major economy
to limit inflation and asset-bubble risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
