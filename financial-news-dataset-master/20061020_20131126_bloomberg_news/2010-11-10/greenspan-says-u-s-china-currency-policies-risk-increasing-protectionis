Alan Greenspan , former chairman of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, said the U.S. is pursuing a policy of
weakening the dollar that risks increasing trade protectionism
when combined with China’s effort to suppress the renminbi.  “The suppression of the renminbi and the recent weakening
of the dollar are, of necessity, producing firming exchange
rates in the rest of the world,” Greenspan wrote in a column in
the Financial Times today.  The ratio of global exports to gross domestic product,
which recovered following the financial crisis, was again
slowing in the third quarter, Greenspan said. Protectionism
would accelerate that slump, he said.  Leaders of the Group of 20 nations meeting in Seoul should
focus on action to promote “unfettered” global trade, while
discouraging the accumulation of reserves designed to suppress
exchange rates for competitive export advantage, he said.  “China has become a major global economic force in recent
years,” Greenspan said. “But it has not yet chosen to take on
the shared global obligations that its economic status
requires.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
