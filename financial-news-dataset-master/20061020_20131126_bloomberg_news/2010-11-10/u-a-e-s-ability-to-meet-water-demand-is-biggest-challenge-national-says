The U.A.E.’s ability to meet water
demand is its biggest challenge, the National reported, citing
remarks made by the Minister of Environment and Water  Rashid bin Fahad  at a Federal National Council gathering.  The Emirates’ 83 desalination plants, which provide nearly
65 percent of domestic, commercial and industrial water needs,
will be insufficient by 2017, the newspaper said, citing a
report by the consultative assembly. If plants were shut down in
an emergency, available water reserves would last only days, the
newspaper said, citing council member Amal al-Qubaisi.  Each resident in the U.A.E., the fourth-largest member of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, uses 550
liters of water a day, the highest rate in the world, while the
global average is 250 liters, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
