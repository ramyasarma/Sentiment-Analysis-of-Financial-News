China’s daily yuan reference rate
climbed by the most in a month on speculation policy makers will
allow the currency to appreciate before this week’s Group of 20
meeting in Seoul.  The central bank set the rate at 6.6450 per dollar, 0.2
percent stronger than yesterday, the biggest gain since Oct. 8.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate 0.5 percent either side of
that level.  “Policy makers in Beijing are continuing to convey the
message that they are allowing the yuan to appreciate gradually,
but in their own time,” said David Cohen, head of Asian
forecasting at Singapore-based Action Economics.   To contact the reporter on this story:
