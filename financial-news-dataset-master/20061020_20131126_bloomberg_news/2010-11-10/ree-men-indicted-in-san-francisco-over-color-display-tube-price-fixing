Three former executives at two
unnamed color-display tube manufacturing companies face charges
that they fixed prices of cathode ray tubes that were used in
computer monitors, the Justice Department said.  Seung-Kyu Lee, Yeong-Ug Yang and Jae-Sik Kim were charged
in an indictment filed today in federal court in San Francisco,
the Justice Department said in an e-mailed statement. The three
men conspired with other unnamed co-conspirators to eliminate
competition by fixing prices, reducing output and allocating
shares of display tubes, prosecutors said.  “As part of the conspiracy, Lee, Yang, Kim and co-
conspirators exchanged color-display tube sales, production,
market share and pricing information” at meetings in Taiwan,
Korea, Malaysia, China and elsewhere, according to the
statement.  All three men are from Korea, according to the indictment.
The companies where the men were employed aren’t disclosed in
the indictment or the statement. If convicted, they face as long
as 10 years in prison plus a $1 million fine, according to the
statement.  Hannah August, a Justice Department spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment after regular business
hours. Contact information wasn’t available for lawyers
representing Lee, Yang, and Kim.  The case is U.S. v. Lee, 10-00817, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
