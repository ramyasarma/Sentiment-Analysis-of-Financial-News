Queensland agreed to sell the Port
of Brisbane to a group including  Global Infrastructure Partners 
and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, raising A$2.1 billion ($2.1
billion) in cash to replace income lost to the financial crisis.  Q Port Holdings Consortium, which also includes investment
group Industry Funds Management, agreed to buy a 99-year lease,
Queensland Treasurer  Andrew Fraser  said in a statement.  The state government is selling roads, a coal terminal and
its coal-freight rail network to make up an estimated A$14
billion revenue shortfall during the global recession. Fraser
said today’s sale means Queensland taxpayers will escape a A$1
billion bill for infrastructure upgrades at the port.  “The consortium has interests in port terminals across
eight countries and it has the right credentials for owning and
operating the port,” Fraser said in the statement.  Global Infrastructure Partners is a $5.64 billion
infrastructure investment fund founded by  Credit Suisse Group AG 
and  General Electric Co. , according to its website.  That group,  Industry Funds Management  and funds managed by
QIC Ltd., each own about 27 percent of Q Port Holdings, the
state government said. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority owns the
remaining stake of about 19 percent, the government said.  Queensland said last month it planned to raise as much as
A$5.05 billion selling shares of coal-train operator QR National
Ltd. in Australia’s largest initial public offering in more than
a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
