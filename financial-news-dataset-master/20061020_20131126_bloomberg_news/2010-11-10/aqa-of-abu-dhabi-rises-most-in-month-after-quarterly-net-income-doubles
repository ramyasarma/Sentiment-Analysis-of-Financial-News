Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.  jumped
the most in almost a month after the state-run company known as
Taqa said third-quarter profit more than doubled because of
higher oil prices and a one-off gain.  The shares advanced 5 percent, the most since Oct. 13, to
1.47 dirhams at 10:36 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  Net income surged to 218 million dirhams ($59.4 million)
from 90 million dirhams a year earlier. Revenue rose to 5.2
billion dirhams from 3.9 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
