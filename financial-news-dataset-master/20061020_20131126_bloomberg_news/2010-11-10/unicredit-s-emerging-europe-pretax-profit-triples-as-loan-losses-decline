UniCredit SpA , the biggest lender in
emerging Europe, said pretax profit in the region more than
tripled as writedowns of bad loans fell 37 percent from the
previous year and revenue rose 7 percent.  Third-quarter pretax profit was 366 million euros ($504
million) in the region that includes most of eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union and Turkey, UniCredit said in slides
prepared for  presentation  to investors. That compared to 105
million euros in the previous year.  Loan loss provisions declined to 319 million euros, 15
percent less than in the previous quarter, mostly because they
declined in Turkey and Russia. They rose in Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovenia and the Baltics.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
