Chad Pennington will take over as
the Miami Dolphins’ starting quarterback, replacing  Chad Henne 
with the team at 4-4 midway through the season.  The change comes three days after Henne threw three
interceptions in a loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He hadn’t
thrown a touchdown pass in the Dolphins’ past two games.  “This is not an indictment on Chad Henne at all,”
Dolphins coach  Tony Sparano  said during a news conference. “At
this particular time it’s something that I feel like I need to
do for our football team.”  Pennington, in his 11th National Football League season,
started three games for Miami last year before an injury to his
throwing shoulder ended his season.  The 34-year-old Pennington led Miami to an 11-5 record in
2008, a season after the Dolphins went 1-15. Pennington, who
spent his first eight NFL seasons with the New York Jets, is the
league leader with a 66.1 career completion percentage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
