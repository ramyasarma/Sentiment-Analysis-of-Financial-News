European  gasoline  barge prices
climbed as stockpiles of the motor fuel dropped to the lowest
level in more than a year.  BP Plc , the buyer of a jet fuel cargo
this week, bought on the barge market.  Gunvor International Ltd. and AOT Trading AG purchased
premium gasoline for a third day. BP started an ethylene plant
at its Gelsenkirchen chemicals site in Germany.  Brent crude for December dropped 0.1 percent to $88.91 a
barrel at 5:11 p.m. local time on ICE. The contract rose 0.7
percent yesterday to $88.96 a barrel.  Light Products  Gasoline traded from $784 to $786 a ton, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus
Bulletin Board and the Platts pricing window. Barges changed
hands at $763 to $776 yesterday.  Total SA  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought for a second day
on the so-called barge market, where most deals are for 1,000 or
2,000 tons. Those prices are for Eurobob grade fuel, to which
ethanol is added before being sold to motorists.  Stockpiles of  motor fuel  in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
plunged 8.2 percent to 716,000 tons in the week to today,
according to PJK, an industry consultant in Oosterhout,
Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since Oct. 22 last year.
Supplies left for Egypt, Mexico, and Nigeria.  The front-month  gasoline crack  widened for a third day to
$3.05 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker in London. That compares with $2.85 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  BP bought two jet fuel barge lots at a premium of $44 a ton
to December ICE gasoil futures, the survey showed. Deutsche
Lufthansa AG sold the fuel. No deals were done in the Platts
window yesterday.  The November ICE gasoil contract expired today, with the
amount to be delivered through the exchange falling to the
lowest level since June.  Gasoil for delivery this month totaled 880,000 tons as 880
lots were tendered for shipment, according to data on
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s  website . That compares with
422,300 tons in October and 357,500 ton last November.  Deliveries of gasoil usually rise in the winter, when
demand for heating oil peaks. Figures can be skewed by product
being taken to put into storage.  Gasoil for December delivery gained $1.75, or 0.2 percent,
to $758.75 a ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange as of
4:39 p.m. local time.  Ultra low sulfur diesel barges changed hands at a premium
of $16 a ton to December ICE gasoil. That’s little changed from
yesterday’s deals at $16 and $17 premiums to that contract.  Refinery News  BP  started an ethylene plant at its Gelsenkirchen chemicals
site in Germany, the country’s second-largest producer of the
commodity, following maintenance.  The unit resumed operations on Nov. 8,  Robert Wine , a
London-based BP spokesman, said today by phone. One of two
cracking units was scheduled to shut in September and October
for the work, a person with knowledge of the matter said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
