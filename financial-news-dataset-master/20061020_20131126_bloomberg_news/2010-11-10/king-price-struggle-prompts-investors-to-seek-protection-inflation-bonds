U.K. inflation-linked bonds are
rebounding from the worst quarterly drop since the start of 2009
as Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  struggles to contain
rising consumer prices.  The securities have gained 0.3 percent since Oct. 26, when
the statistics office said the U.K.  economy grew  twice as fast
as analysts forecast in the third quarter, according to indexes
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They had lost 1.345
percent since the start of October.  Investors are buying more protection against inflation as
the strength of the economy, a falling pound and the prospect of
a sales-tax increase next year threaten to push the cost of
living higher, strategists say. The central bank said in its
quarterly inflation report today that there are “significant
uncertainties” around the outlook for inflation and that the
near-term overshoot of the target may be “more pronounced” if
commodity prices continue to rise.  “We see value in short-dated index-linked bonds as we
believe inflation will remain sticky in the near term,” said
 Graeme Caughey , who helps oversee about $234 billion at
Edinburgh-based Scottish Widows Investment Partnerships, the
biggest holder of U.K. inflation bonds according to regulatory
filings. “With the policy that the Bank of England is pursuing,
and other factors such as impending tax increases, it hard to
see this trend reversed any time soon.”  Inflation  stayed at 3.1 percent in September, exceeding the
government’s 3 percent limit for a seventh month. The bank’s
forecasts in August had showed the average rate would stay below
the ceiling through each quarter of next year and drop as low as
1.5 percent at the start of 2012.  King’s View  King told executives on Oct. 19 that “it may be some
while” before inflation returns to the Bank of England’s
central 2 percent target. He predicted it will eventually slow
below the goal because of “extremely subdued” price pressures
in the aftermath of the recession.  Before then, the inflation rate will stay higher because of
the government’s plans to raise sales tax in January to 20
percent from the current 17.5 percent. The pound has dropped by
about a fifth against the currencies of the U.K.’s major trading
partners since the start of 2007, raising the cost of
commodities and other imports. Oil prices have climbed 88
percent since the start of 2009, while cotton has more than
doubled this year, touching a record yesterday.  Retail-price inflation, a cost of living measure used in
wage negotiations and as a benchmark for inflation-linked bonds,
is even higher than the consumer-price measure targeted by the
Bank of England, touching 4.6 percent in September.  ‘Persistently High’  “Inflation may well move up a bit higher and stay
persistently high for longer than the Bank of England thinks,”
said  Philip Rush , an economist at Nomura International Plc in
London. “It’s quite likely they’ll end up having to lift their
near-term inflation forecasts.”  Rush says inflation may still be at about 3.1 percent at
the start of 2011, and commodity-cost increases raise the risk
that it may be even higher.  Consumers’ inflation expectations have also shown signs of
picking up. A YouGov Plc survey for Citigroup Inc. showed
Britons’ predictions for price increases in the next year rose
to 3 percent in October, matching the highest level since 2008.  “Inflation is definitely an issue in the U.K., at least in
the near term,” said  Pavan Wadhwa , head of European interest-
rate strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London. “Investors
should not underestimate that risk, and I see a benefit of
inflation protection in this environment.”  Investor Protection  Inflation-linked bonds track consumer-price gains to
compensate investors for the erosion of debt values caused by
inflation. The bonds outperform regular bonds as consumer-price
expectations increase, sending breakeven rates higher. When
investors buy inflation-protected bonds, they receive so-called
real yields, which tend to be lower than those of nominal bonds.
The advantage of index-linked bonds is that their principal
increases with inflation.  The  10-year breakeven rate , a gauge of market expectations
of price growth, recovered to 2.9 percentage points today from a
low for the year of 2.5 percentage points on Aug. 25. An August
report showing the U.K. economy grew the fastest in nine years
lifted investors’ outlook on prices. Before that, credit-rating
cuts and rising bond yields in Ireland and other European
nations signaled the possibility of a return to recession and a
slump in inflation.  The outlook for inflation has split the Bank of England’s
nine-member rate-setting panel three ways.  Andrew Sentance  has
sought since June to increase the benchmark interest rate to
bring consumer prices under control, while  Adam Posen  last month
wanted to expand bond purchases to support the recovery.  BOE Decision  The bank last week declined to follow the U.S. Federal
Reserve in pumping more stimulus into the economy, and instead
left the key rate at a record low of 0.5 percent and held its
bond-purchase plan, began in March last year, at 200 billion
pounds ($321 billion). Minutes of the decision will be published
on Nov. 17.  “There’s a market perception that policy makers here are
willing to take inflation risk to support growth,” said  Robin Marshall , a director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson
Investment Management in London, which manages $20 billion in
assets. “We’re overweight inflation-linked gilts.”  Posen argues that the economy faces a risk of deflation and
that Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s budget squeeze may create a
“material drag-down” on growth. The government plans to cut
annual spending by 81 billion pounds by 2015, shedding 490,000
public-sector jobs in the process.  Job Cuts  “Prices will come down again next year,” said  John Hydeskov , senior foreign-exchange analyst at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “Nearly half a million people will be laid off over
the next four to five years, and that will continue to lower
price pressures in the economy.”  For now, data and business surveys suggest companies have
been able to charge customers more to offset higher costs.
Producer prices jumped the most in six months in October, the
Office for National Statistics said Nov. 5.  Prices charged by service companies climbed at the fastest
pace in two years, according to a survey by the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply and Markit Economics. Shop
prices rose 2.2 percent last month from a year earlier, the most
since January, the British Retail Consortium said Nov. 3.  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in London, said that even though the economic recovery may
falter, investors can protect themselves against the persistence
of the inflation bout next year by buying inflation protection
for shorter maturities.  “The frustration is, given how weak the economy is,
inflation hasn’t come down,” said Hill. “There’s a good reason
for holding the shorter dated index-linked bonds for inflation
protection.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
