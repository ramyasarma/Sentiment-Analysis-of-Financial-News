Abu Dhabi  shares  climbed a third day
this week after  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.  said third-quarter
profit more than doubled and on speculation last week’s declines
were overdone given economic growth prospects.  Abu Dhabi National, the state-run company known as Taqa,
rose 3.6 percent after net income surged because of higher oil
prices and a one-off gain.  Aldar Properties PJSC  climbed 2.2
percent. The  ADX General Index  advanced 0.2 percent, the most
since Nov. 7, to 2,761.66, at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi.
Qatar’s  QE Index  climbed 0.5 percent to 8,040.78, the highest in
more than two years led by  Qatar National Bank.   “The strong Taqa earnings helped lift Abu Dhabi shares,”
said  Humam Al-Shamaa,  economic adviser at Al-Fajer Securities in
Abu Dhabi. “The drop last week was overdone and investors are
buying Aldar on yesterday’s news.”  A decline of 2.4 percent last week has left the 66
companies in Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index  valued at 10 times
estimated earnings,  data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 13.5 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. 
The United Arab Emirates economy may expand 2.4 percent this
year from a previous estimate for growth of 1.3 percent, the
International Monetary Fund said in an Oct. 24 report.  Taqa increased the most since Oct. 11 to 1.45 dirhams. Net
income rose to 218 million dirhams ($59.4 million) from 90
million dirhams a year earlier. Separately, the company expects
to complete the refinancing of a $3 billion loan by the end of
the year, Chief Financial Officer  Doug Fraser  said today.  Aldar’s Loss  Aldar, the biggest property developer in Abu Dhabi, jumped
to 2.34 dirhams, the highest level since Nov. 3. Aldar yesterday
reported a third-quarter loss of 731.2 million dirhams compared
with profit of 270.1 million dirhams a year earlier. The median
estimate of three analysts was for a loss of 215 million
dirhams, according to Bloomberg data.  “Investors had been shorting Aldar in anticipation of weak
third-quarter results,” said  Omar Abdallah , director at A/T
Capital Management in Dubai. “Once they came out, there’s been
short-covering on the stock, which has pushed the price up.”
Short-covering refers to the closing out of bets that an asset
would weaken.  Qatar National Bank climbed to the highest in more than
five years, adding 1.3 percent to 170.2 riyals. The country’s
biggest lender by assets received orders worth $6 billion for
its $1.5 billion dollar bond sale.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index  dropped 0.5 percent, while
Kuwait’s  gauge  and Oman’s  MSM30 Index  advanced 0.2 percent.
Bahrain’s  gauge  retreated 0.5 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul
All Share Index  decreased 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
