Hungary’s main stock index headed
for its  biggest drop  in almost four months after the government
posted a budget plan showing a special tax on industries will
last two years longer that previously stated.  The BUX Index sank 2.4 percent to 22,774.23 as of 12:34
p.m. in Budapest, heading for the biggest decline since July 19.
The retreat was the largest among the 89 equity indexes tracked
by Bloomberg worldwide.  Next year’s budget plan includes revenue projections for a
special tax on selected industries through 2014, instead of
ending the temporary levy after 2012 as earlier announced,
according to the draft posted on Parliament’s website.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced a special tax on
energy companies, telecommunications operators and retail chains
on Oct. 13 as part of a package to reduce the government
deficit. In July, Hungary fell out with the International
Monetary Fund and European Union, which provided the country
with a bailout during the global credit crisis in 2008, over the
extent of its deficit.  “Obviously if they extend all the crisis taxes it doesn’t
help stocks,”  Zoltan Reczey , an analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz
RT, said in a phone interview.  OTP Bank Nyrt. slumped 3.9 percent, the biggest drop in
more than a month. Hungary’s largest lender said July 23 it will
pay a total of 41 billion forint ($206 million) under a special
bank tax in 2010, 5 billion forint under a levy introduced by
the previous government and 36 billion forint under the tax on
financial institutions approved July 22.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the former phone monopoly, retreated
1 percent to 597 forint. The company, now controlled by Deutsche
Telekom AG, said Nov. 4 it may have to pay 27 billion forint
each year through 2012 as a result of a special tax.  Mol Nyrt., the country’s largest refiner, sank 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
