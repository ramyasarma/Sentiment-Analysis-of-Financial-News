Investcorp Bank BSC , the Bahrain-
based alternative-investment firm, expects the share of Gulf
Arab investors in its hedge funds to rise to about half in a few
years from about 30 percent now as they seek bigger returns.  “There is a lot of interest from the Middle East” in
hedge funds as they have provided better returns than equity
markets and with lower volatility,  Deepak Gurnani , Investcorp’s
head of hedge funds and chief investment officer, said in an
interview in Dubai today. Middle East funds are likely to
boost allocations to hedge funds over the next six to nine
months, he said.  Investcorp’s funds of hedge funds business manages $4.7
billion, including $1 billion of its own money, Gurnani said.
About 70 percent of the investors in its hedge funds are U.S.
institutions, he said.  Investcorp posted a profit of $102.2 million in the fiscal
year through June, compared with a loss in the preceding year as
income from hedge-fund investments rebounded and the decline in
value of its private equity assets halted. The company, which
invests in private equity, funds of hedge funds and real estate,
had $9.7 billion of assets under management at the end of June,
up from $8.8 billion a year earlier.  Investors’ allocations to hedge funds may vary from
5 percent to 40 percent of their portfolios, although it is
lower for Middle Eastern funds than those in the U.S., Gurnani
said. Investments by Middle East funds in hedge funds will
consequently rise at a faster pace, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
