Porsche SE ’s owners exercised the
right to sell an Austrian automotive trading company to
 Volkswagen AG  for 3.3 billion euros ($4.5 billion).  The founding Porsche and Piech families exercised a put
option to sell Porsche Holding Salzburg to Europe’s largest
carmaker, Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW said in a statement today.
The deal, to be completed by Sept. 30, 2011, is part of an
August 2009 transaction for Volkswagen to buy a controlling
stake in the sportscar maker’s operating business.  “This decision by the Porsche and Piech families is a
clear commitment to implementing the integrated automotive
group,” Volkswagen said in the statement.  Porsche and VW agreed last year to combine after the 911
sports-car maker’s debt tripled to more than 10 billion euros
following a failed bid to buy VW by securing stock through
options trading. VW has since purchased 49.9 percent of
Stuttgart, Germany-based Porsche’s operating business for 3.9
billion euros, setting the stage for a merger in 2011.  VW Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said last
month that he may put on hold the combination to first resolve
U.S. lawsuits and German tax disputes. As part of the original
deal, VW has the option to pay cash for the remaining stake in
Porsche’s carmaking operations without merging with Porsche’s
holding company. Under this scenario, Porsche’s holding company
would continue to manage its VW stake and be legally responsible
for the pending U.S. litigation.  China, Austria  Porsche Holding Salzburg, which distributes cars in Europe
and China, sold 421,000 vehicles in the year ended March 31,
generating  sales  of 12.2 billion euros. The company employs
20,300 people.  Porsche shareholders will be asked Nov. 30 to approve a
capital increase of about 5 billion euros in the first half of
2011 with the Porsche and Piech families due to contribute 2.5
billion euros.  Exercising the put option “presses the trigger for another
part of the process, giving the families the cash to buy Porsche
shares in a capital increase,” said  Adam Hull , an analyst at
WestLB AG in London with a “buy” recommendation on both
carmakers.  “But it’s not enough in itself,” Hull said. “Whether the
process can go ahead as planned will depend on the lawsuits”
and whether Porsche is successful in January with a motion to
dismiss them, he said.  Debt  Volkswagen’s  preferred shares  fell 2.80 euros, or 2.5
percent, to 108.65 euros at the 5.30 p.m. close of trading in
Frankfurt. Porsche’s preferred stock lost 21.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to 43.33 euros.  Today’s deal will make a “significant contribution” to
reach VW’s goal of overtaking  Toyota Motor Corp.  as the world’s
biggest carmaker by 2018, Winterkorn said today.  Porsche’s debt shrank to 6 billion euros as of July 31 from
11.4 billion euros a year earlier, mainly because of the 3.9
billion euros VW paid for the stake in the sportscar making
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
