French inflation held steady in
October as a stronger euro helped diminish higher costs for
dollar-priced food and energy products and slack in the economy
limited companies pricing power.  Consumer prices based on European Union methodology rose
1.8 percent from a year earlier, matching 1.8 the September
increase, the Paris-based national statistics office  Insee  said
today. That matches economists’ expectations, according to the
median of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The euro climbed more than 16 percent through the end of
October from its level on June 7, softening the impact of higher
global food and energy prices. With spare capacity remaining in
the economy in the wake of France’s worst recession since World
War II, underlying price pressures will probably remain
contained, economists said.  “The strong euro is offsetting some of the impact of
rising food and energy prices,” said  Joost Beaumont , an
economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. “France is still coping
with the aftermath of recession. The spare capacity in the
economy should keep core inflation down.”  In neighboring Germany, which shares the single European
currency, prices rose 1.3 percent in both September and October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
