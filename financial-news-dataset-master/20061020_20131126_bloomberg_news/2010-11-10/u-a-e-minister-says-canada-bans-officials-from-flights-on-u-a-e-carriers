United Arab Emirates Foreign
Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan said Canada has
banned its government officials from flying on U.A.E. air
carriers, calling the action an “escalation” of a dispute
between the countries over landing rights for commercial
flights.  “I don’t think it’s a smart decision,” Sheikh Abdullah
said at a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council foreign
ministers in Abu Dhabi. “This is an escalation.”  U.A.E. carriers including Emirates have been seeking dozens
of new landing slots in Canada, contending that the six weekly
flights currently allowed aren’t enough to meet demand.
Transport Canada, the government agency that oversees the
airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots on
concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada’s traffic
to cities such as Frankfurt.  On Nov. 9, the U.A.E. embassy in Ottawa said the nation
will begin requiring Canadian visitors to apply for visas,
starting Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
