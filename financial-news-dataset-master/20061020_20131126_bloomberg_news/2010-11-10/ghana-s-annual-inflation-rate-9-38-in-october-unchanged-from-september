Ghana’s inflation rate was unchanged
in October as the strength of the local currency helped to
stabilize the cost of imported goods and services.  Consumer prices increased by 9.38 percent from a year
earlier, the same rate as in September, Ebo Duncan, a
statistician with the Ghana Statistical Service, told reporters
today in the capital, Accra.  “It is a good reading, showing that ongoing price pressures
are being contained,”  Lisa Lewin , head of sub-Saharan Africa
analysis at Business Monitor International, said in an e-mailed
note today. “The implications for the December rate-setting
meeting are neutral. The November inflation reading will be the
real one to watch in this regard.”  The inflation rate has fallen from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009 after Ghana’s cedi halted its decline
against the dollar. The cedi, which fell 15 percent against the
U.S. currency in the first half of 2009, has been little changed
in the past 12 months.  Slowing inflation has enabled the central bank to cut its
key interest rate by 4.5 percentage points this year. The last
reduction, in July, took the rate to 13.5 percent from 15
percent. The rate was maintained during the September review.  “We expect inflation to remain in single digits this year,”
the deputy governor of the Bank of Ghana,  Kofi Wampah , said on
Oct. 7. “The bank looks to properly position the key interest
rate when it holds its last meeting this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
