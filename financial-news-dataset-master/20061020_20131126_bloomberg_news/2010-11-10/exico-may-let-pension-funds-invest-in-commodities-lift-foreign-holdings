  Mexico  may allow pension funds, the
nation’s biggest institutional investors, to tap global
commodities that are trading at near two-year highs.  The industry’s regulator is holding discussions on allowing
Afores, as the government-regulated funds are known, to invest
in raw materials, Pedro Ordorica, president of the agency, said
at the Bloomberg Mexico Economic Summit in Mexico City.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
traded at its highest level since Oct. 3, 2008 yesterday after
the U.S. Federal Reserve decided last week to pump $600 billion
into the world’s largest economy. Mexican authorities are also
studying how pension funds can increase their foreign
investments to boost returns, Ordorica said.  Mexican government-regulated pension funds had 1.42
trillion pesos ($116 billion) under management in October, the
regulator known as Consar said in a statement today on its
website.  The regulator will change investment rules in the first
quarter of 2011, Ordorica said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
