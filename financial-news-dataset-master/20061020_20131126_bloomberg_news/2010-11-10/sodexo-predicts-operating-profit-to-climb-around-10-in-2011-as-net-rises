Sodexo , the world’s second-largest
catering company, posted a 4.1 percent increase in full-year
profit and forecast earnings and revenue growth for next year
after winning contracts at a faster pace.  Net income in the 12 months through August advanced to 409
million euros ($563 million) from 393 million euros a year
earlier, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France-based Sodexo said today in
a statement. That compared with the 407.8 million-euro average
of nine analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sodexo said it won 8 percent more contracts than in the
previous year, compared with 6 percent growth in fiscal 2009.
The company is hiring and  investing  to widen its lineup of
services such as building-maintenance and cleaning. Latin
America and Asia are leading growth in revenue.  “Sodexo finished the year strongly,”  Nigel Parson , an
analyst at Evolution Securities in London, said in a research
report. He said he plans to raise his estimate of 2011 earnings
before interest and tax by about 2 percent.  Sodexo forecast a 10 percent increase in operating profit
at constant exchange rates, following a 9.5 percent gain in
fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 organic sales will rise 3 percent to 4
percent, after climbing 2.5 percent last year, the company also
said. Total sales rose 3.9 percent to 15.3 billion euros.  Higher Dividend  Sodexo  fell 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 47.80 euros at
11:05 a.m. in Paris trading, valuing the company at 7.51 billion
euros. The shares have risen 20 percent this year, about
matching the almost 21 percent gain for larger rival  Compass.   The company exceeded objectives set at the beginning of the
year, Chief Executive Officer  Michel Landel  said in the
statement. “Solid earnings growth, the strong generation of
cash during the year and its strong confidence for the future,”
led the company to propose a dividend of 1.35 euros a share, 6.3
percent higher than the year earlier.  On-Site Service Solutions, Sodexo’s food and facilities
management business, increased sales by 4.3 percent to 14.6
billion euros. Revenue at the company’s service-voucher unit
fell 3.1 percent to 689 million euros because of the revaluation
of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the Brazilian
real. Excluding currency shifts, acquisitions and disposals, the
unit’s so-called organic sales climbed 7.3 percent.  Organic revenue rose 1.7 percent in continental Europe and
1.9 percent in North America. The rest of the world, including
Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, increased
sales by 7.5 percent on the same basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
