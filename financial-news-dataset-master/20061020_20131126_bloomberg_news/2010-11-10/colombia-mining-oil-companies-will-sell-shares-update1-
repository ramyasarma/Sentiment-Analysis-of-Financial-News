Colombian mining and oil companies
may sell shares in initial public offerings next year as
integration with Peru and Chile boosts investor demand, said
 Juan Pablo Cordoba , president of the nation’s stock exchange.  Investors in Peru and Chile, who will be able to buy shares
on all three exchanges in January, have also expressed interest
in Colombian banking stocks, Cordoba said today in an interview
in Lima.  “We have good momentum in gold, oil and gas in Colombia,
so there’s a lot of investor interest in that area,” Cordoba
said. “There’s a significant portfolio of companies looking to
list on the Colombian market, which is a very attractive and
deep source of financing.”  Colombia has lined up $50 billion in mining and energy
projects through 2015, according to the Mines and Energy
Ministry. Mining companies, including South Africa’s  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd . and Canada’s  Greystar Resources Ltd. , are exploring
for gold in Colombia, while London-based  Rio Tinto Group  is
studying an aluminum project.  Central American companies seeking lower costs and access
to a deeper investor base may also try to list shares on the
integrated exchange, Cordoba said.  The integrated Andean market will have a value of $661
billion, second in Latin America behind Brazil’s $1.75 trillion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  IGBC Index  fell 2.5 percent to 15,830.63, while the
Colcap Index dropped 2.5 percent to 1,889.62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
