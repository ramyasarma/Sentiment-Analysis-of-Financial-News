Russia’s trade  surplus  widened to
$10.4 billion in September from a revised $8 billion a month
earlier as imports fell for the first time this year.  Imports declined to $23.55 billion from $23.82 billion in
August, the central bank said today on its  website . Exports rose
to $33.96 billion from $31.78 billion.  Russian retail sales fell in September, the first monthly
decline this year, after disposable incomes shrank, signaling a
possible slowdown in the economic recovery. Sales dropped as
inflation accelerated after the worst drought in at least 50
years damaged crops and pushed up food prices, Economy Minister
 Elvira Nabiullina  said Oct. 25.  Machinery and other manufactured equipment accounted for 45
percent of all imports from the Baltic states and countries
outside of the former Soviet Union, according to the Federal
Customs Service. Energy, including oil and gas, accounted for 72
percent of exports, the customs office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
