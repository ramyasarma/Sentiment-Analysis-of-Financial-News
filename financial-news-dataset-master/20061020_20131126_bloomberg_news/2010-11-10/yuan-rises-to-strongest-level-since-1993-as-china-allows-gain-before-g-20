China’s yuan climbed to the
strongest level against the dollar since 1993 on speculation the
country’s central bank will permit faster appreciation before
Group of 20 leaders meet tomorrow in Seoul.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily reference rate at
6.6450, 0.2 percent stronger, the biggest gain since Oct. 8. The
appreciation came before the summit of the G-20 leaders who are
seeking to avert a worldwide “currency war” and address global
imbalances. Chinese regulators yesterday tightened controls on
capital inflows, ordering banks to hold more foreign-currency
positions and strengthening auditing of overseas fundraising.  “International pressure has had a big impact on recent
faster gains in the yuan,” said Liu Dongliang, a Shenzhen-based
analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the country’s sixth-largest
lender by market value. “Regulators are tightening monitoring
on hot-money inflow channels, which will pave the way for faster
appreciation.”  The yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.6395 a dollar as of 2:41
p.m. in Shanghai, the strongest level since China unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. It earlier reached
6.6353. The currency surged 0.51 percent yesterday, the biggest
daily advance since China abandoned a peg against the greenback
in July 2005.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4430 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Liu estimated the yuan will rise to between 6.5 to 6.6 a
dollar by the end of this year.  Trade Surplus  China posted a larger-than-forecast $27.1 billion  trade
surplus  in October, the customs bureau said today. The surplus,
the second biggest this year, compared with the $25 billion
median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
 Exports  gained 22.9 percent from a year earlier and imports rose
25.3 percent, the customs data showed.  China told some lenders, including Bank of Communications
Co., to increase their reserve ratios by half a percentage
point, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Chinese consumer prices rose 4 percent in October from a year
earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of the data due
tomorrow. That would be the fastest pace since October 2008.  Deputy financial chiefs from Group of 20 nations are still
debating currency and current-account issues in the lead up to
the Seoul summit, said Kim Yoon Kyung, a spokesman for South
Korea’s G-20 preparation committee. Controversy over currencies
has been greater than expected and the deputies meeting have yet
to agree on the wording of draft documents for their leaders,
Kim told reporters in Seoul today.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said Nov. 8
that it is “overwhelmingly” in China’s interest to let the
yuan rise, as the House of Representatives attempts to impose
punitive duties on Chinese imports.  -- Belinda Cao . Editors: Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
