U.S. stocks rose, halting a two-day
slide, as a rally in oil lifted energy producers and concern
eased that Ireland’s debt crisis will worsen. Treasuries
fluctuated following a $16 billion 30-year bond auction, while
the dollar trimmed gains.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 0.4 percent to
1,218.71 at 4 p.m. in New York. The 30-year yield was little
changed at 4.25 percent and the  Dollar Index  climbed 0.3
percent, paring an earlier 0.9 percent rally as the U.S.
currency erased gains versus the euro. Irish 10-year bond yields
rose for a 12th day and touched a record 622 basis points more
than German bunds. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodities
index snapped a nine-day rally, its longest since 2005.  The S&P 500 halted a retreat from last week’s two-year high
as oil climbed 1.3 percent to $87.81 a barrel, the most since
2008, as government data showed an unexpected drop in supplies.
Financial markets fluctuated for much of the day as investors
awaited a Group of 20 nations meeting in Seoul tomorrow, where
leaders will discuss global imbalances in the wake of a Federal
Reserve plan to buy $600 billion in Treasuries to spur growth.  “Currency traders have reversed bets on the sovereign debt
fears, and you see that translating into a weakening dollar and
stronger equity markets,” said  Michael James , a managing
director at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
“Ireland’s been the focus of sovereign debt concerns over the
last weeks, but the market seems to be weathering those fears.”  Irish Concern  Concern over the Irish debt crisis eased after the nation’s
central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said he’s convinced the
nation will be able to return to bond markets in 2011 as the
government steps up austerity measures to lower the budget
deficit and restore investor confidence.  About two stocks gained for each that fell on U.S.
exchanges. Citigroup Inc. and Chevron Corp. climbed more than
1.9 percent each to lead financial and energy companies to the
top gains among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  Boeing Co. slid 3.2 percent, limiting the Dow Jones
Industrial Average’s advance, after the world’s largest
aerospace company suspended test flights of the 787 Dreamliner
following a fire that forced an emergency landing. The 30-stock
Dow rose 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,357.04.  A presidential commission’s leaders proposed a $3.8
trillion deficit-cutting plan that would cut Social Security and
Medicare, reduce income-tax rates and eliminate tax breaks
including the mortgage-interest deduction. The co-chairmen of
the panel appointed by President  Barack Obama  suggested reducing
Social Security spending by raising the retirement age to 68 in
about 2050 and 69 in about 2075. The plan also would slow the
rate at which benefits grow. The savings would come between 2012
and 2020.  ‘Better Start Thinking’  “This country’s out of money and we better start
thinking,” said co-chairman  Erskine Bowles . Without “tough
choices,” he said, “we’re on the most predictable path toward
an economic crisis that I can imagine.”  U.S. stock-index futures erased losses in premarket trading
after the Labor Department said applications for jobless
benefits declined by 24,000 to a four-month low of 435,000 in
the week ended Nov. 6, lower than the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. The trade deficit narrowed more than
forecast in September, the Commerce Department said.  The yield on 10-year Treasuries slipped one basis point to
2.65 percent, erasing gains after the Fed announced plans for 18
open-market operations to buy $105 billion of debt during the
next 30 days as it expands its policy of quantitative easing.  Bond Auction  The U.S. sold $16 billion of the 30-year bonds today at a
yield of 4.32 percent, compared with the average forecast of
4.288 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s
18 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered,
was 2.31, the lowest since November 2009.  Bidding for the $24 billion of 10-year notes sold yesterday
amounted to 2.80 times the securities sold, the least since
February.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  fell 0.7 percent, retreating
from a two-year high as more than four stocks declined for every
one that rose.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto Group sank more
than 2 percent.  Irish bonds fell for a 12th day, extending their longest
stretch of declines since at least 2007. LCH Clearnet Ltd. said
today it will raise margin requirements for customers trading
Irish government bonds after debt yields soared. Ireland’s
Honohan said investors remain concerned about problems
“hiding” within the nation’s banks.  ‘Hiding Somewhere’  “I sense a concern in the market that some other problems
might be hiding somewhere,” Honohan, who is a member of the
European Central Bank’s Governing Council, said at the Irish
parliament in Dublin today. “Attention has naturally focused on
the residential mortgage book, and the scale of the loan-losses
that need to be allowed for here,” he said. “There is nothing
else hidden in banks.”  The yield on the Irish 10-year bond jumped 70 basis points
to 8.64 percent, according to Bloomberg generic yields. The
difference in yield, or spread, between Portuguese 10-year debt
and bunds widened 24 basis points to 460 basis points. The
nation sold 1.24 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of 2016 and 2020
bonds. Germany and Italy also sold securities today.  The pound strengthened 0.8 percent against the dollar to
trade at $1.6117 after the Bank of England said inflation is
likely to fall back toward its 2 percent target over a two-year
forecast period. The yuan gained as much as 0.17 percent to
6.6325 per dollar, the highest level since the central bank
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Cotton futures for March delivery fell 6 cents, the maximum
allowed by the exchange, or 4.1 percent, to $1.4111 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S in New York. Earlier, the fiber touched a record
$1.5195, the highest level in 140 years of trading.  Emerging Markets  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  slipped 0.4 percent.
Hungary’s BUX index tumbled 4.7 percent, the most among global
equity indexes, after a draft of the 2011 budget indicated a
crisis tax on companies may be extended two years. Russia’s
Micex index lost 1.3 percent. China’s  Shanghai Composite Index 
fell 0.6 percent, its second straight decline, and  Philippine
Stock Exchange Index  slid 1.6 percent, the most since August.  China banks’ reserve requirements will increase 0.5
percentage points from Nov. 16, the People’s Bank of China said
in a statement on its website. The announcement followed media
reports today of increases for selected banks.  Inflows of cash from monetary easing abroad and investors
speculating on gains in the yuan threaten to worsen Chinese
inflation forecast to have risen to a two-year high in October.
The trade imbalance and currency curbs that have pushed China’s
foreign-exchange reserves to $2.65 trillion will be discussed by
Group of 20 leaders meeting in Seoul from tomorrow.  “There is no doubt that China is on its way to further
tightening,” said  Danny Yan , Hong Kong-based fund manager at
Taifook Asset Management, which oversees about $400 million.
“The whole world is flooded with capital that has nowhere to
go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
