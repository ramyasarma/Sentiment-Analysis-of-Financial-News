Soybeans dropped from a 26-month
high in Chicago and wheat and corn retreated on speculation
demand for U.S. crops will decline as the dollar strengthens.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, advanced for a fourth day after Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said the central
bank wants to make sure the currency retains its purchasing
power. A stronger dollar makes U.S. crops more expensive for
importers using other monies.  “The strengthening of the dollar has made it more
difficult for the grains to hold onto the higher levels we saw
yesterday,” said  Justine White , an analyst at VM Group in
London. “This will remain a factor. Grains and beans are like
many other commodities, still being pushed and pulled along by a
changeable macroeconomic background complex.”  Soybeans for January delivery slid 6.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.2275 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Yesterday prices reached $13.4475, the
highest level since Aug. 28, 2008, as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture lowered estimates for national and global stockpiles
on higher  import  demand from China and the European Union.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 7 cents, or 1 percent,
to $7.1475 a bushel. The grain declined 2 percent yesterday, the
most in a week.  Corn Drops  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 1.4 percent to 223 euros ($306.96) a metric ton.  March-delivery corn retreated 5.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$5.8475 a bushel in Chicago. The grain has jumped 48 percent in
the past year on speculation that hot, dry weather in August
hurt crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  “The strength of the dollar caused a lot of traders to
call out of the market,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at
Commodity Broking Services Pty, said by phone from Sydney.  The ThomsonReuters/Jefferies CRB Index fell for the first
time in 10 sessions, losing as much as 0.4 percent.  The USDA yesterday forecast national corn output of 12.54
billion bushels, 1 percent below a month-earlier estimate and
4.4 percent less than last year’s record 13.11 billion. Stocks
will total 827 million bushels as of Sept. 1, down from 902
million predicted in October and less than half the 1.708
billion at the end of last year, it said.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast corn
production at 12.542 billion bushels and stockpiles of 831
million bushels.  “The report yesterday was somewhat underwhelming for corn
and wheat,” VM Group’s White said. “The market has almost
become accustomed to these reports delivering some sort of shock
factor, which has tended to give prices added impetus to the
upside. This time round it didn’t deliver the same jolt.”  Prices surged on Oct. 8 as the USDA cut crop-supply
forecasts. Soybeans jumped 6.6 percent that day, corn added 6
percent and wheat gained 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
