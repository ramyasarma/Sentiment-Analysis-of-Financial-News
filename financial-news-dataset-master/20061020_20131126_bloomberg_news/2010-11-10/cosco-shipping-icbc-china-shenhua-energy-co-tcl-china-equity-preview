China’s benchmark stock index rose
as banks and oil refiners advanced after Moody’s Investors
Service boosted the nation’s debt rating and speculation mounted
the government will raise fuel prices. Consumer-related
companies erased gains on concern costs will rise.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  climbed 1.1 percent after
Moody’s  said it boosted China’s rating one step to Aa3, the
fourth-highest grade.  PetroChina Co.  and China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. jumped more than 5 percent, contributing most to
gains, as investors bet higher energy prices would boost margins.
Liquor maker  Kweichow Moutai Co.  slid 2.1 percent.  “There’s still room for stocks to go up, because we have
abundant liquidity both home and abroad,” said Zhang Ling, a
fund manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co.  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, climbed 32.39, or 1 percent, to
3,147.74 at the 3 p.m. close, even as three stocks fell for each
that rose. The  CSI 300 Index  added 0.3 percent to 3,509.98, led
by energy stocks.  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 33 percent from its July
5 low as fund flows to emerging markets surged. Stocks in the
gauge are valued at 17.8 times estimated earnings, less than
half the multiple of 43 when the market peaked in 2007.  The index gained as much as 2.3 percent today after Moody’s
raised China’s foreign and local debt rating to Aa3, the fourth-
highest ranking, citing financial strength and the ability to
contain losses from a credit boom. The ratings company
maintained a positive outlook.  Monetary Policy  The People’s Bank of China said in a statement yesterday
banks’ reserve requirements will rise 50 basis points from Nov.
16, the first nationwide increase since May. China ordered some
lenders, including Bank of Communications Co., to increase their
reserve ratios by an additional 50 basis points from Nov. 15, a
person with direct knowledge of the matter said yesterday.  The central bank ordered lenders to set aside more reserves
after October’s larger-than-forecast $27.1 billion trade surplus
threatened to add to the risk of asset bubbles. Inflation
accelerated to 4.4 percent in October, the fastest pace in two
years, and more than the 4 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 28 economists, according to the
statistics bureau today. In September, prices rose 3.6 percent.  Banks Gain  Agricultural Bank climbed 1.1 percent to 2.80 yuan. Bank of
Communications Co. gained 0.8 percent to 6.18 yuan.  The nation’s efforts to tackle asset bubbles and avert the
spread of bad loans has meant the “likely containment and
effective management” of losses from record lending last year
to counter the financial crisis, Moody’s said. That combined
with China’s “resilient” economic growth were reasons for the
upgrade, the ratings company said.  PetroChina gained 7.7 percent to 12.74 yuan, the most since
September 2008.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the nation’s
largest oil refiner, added 5.2 percent to 9.49 yuan, the biggest
gain in 11 months. The two stocks’ advance together accounted
for 91 percent of the gain on the Shanghai Composite.  “Oil prices are the primary reason supporting the shares
today,” Yin Xiaodong, an analyst with Beijing-based Citic
Securities Co., said by telephone today. “Some investors are
speculating that domestic retail fuel prices will be raised if
crude continues to rise.”  China last increased fuel prices by 3 percent on Oct. 26
under a mechanism that allows the government to revise gasoline
and diesel prices when crude costs change more than 4 percent
over 22 working days. Crude futures in New York have risen 7.2
percent since last month’s adjustment.  Crude in New York rose as much as 0.8 percent to $88.55 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
the highest since Oct. 9, 2008. Futures were at $88.41 a barrel
at 4:11 p.m. Singapore time.  Oil Processing  China’s crude oil processing volume rose to a record last
month after refiners increased production to ease a domestic
fuel shortage, the China Mainland Marketing Research Co., which
compiles data for the National Bureau of Statistics, said today.  “The diesel shortage and stronger processing data add to
the positive sentiment for Sinopec and PetroChina,” Yin said.  Kweichow Moutai lost 2.1 percent to 175.92 yuan.
Heilongjiang Agriculture Co. declined 1.9 percent, erasing an
earlier gain of 1.2 percent.  Higher gasoline and diesel prices will add to costs for
manufacturers and farmers and increase inflationary risks.  -- Chua Kong Ho ,  Zhang Shidong . With assistance from Wang Ying in
