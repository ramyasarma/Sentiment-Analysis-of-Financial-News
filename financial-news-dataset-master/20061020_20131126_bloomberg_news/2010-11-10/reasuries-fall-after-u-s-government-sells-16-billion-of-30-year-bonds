Treasuries rose after the Federal
Reserve announced plans to buy $105 billion of debt during the
next 30 days and the Treasury completed $72 billion in sales of
notes and bonds.  The benchmark 10-year note erased declines as the central
bank offered details of its expanded policy of quantitative
easing to bolster the economy. Thirty-year bond yields
fluctuated after touching a six-month high as a $16 billion
auction of the securities drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, of 2.31, the lowest since November 2009.  “The auctions are out of the way, they came on the cheap
side and now, after everything, the Fed is still buying,” said
 David Ader , head of government bond strategy at Stamford,
Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group LLC. “The biggest seller,
the Treasury, has left the market, and the biggest buyer, the
Fed, is getting ready to start, and that has brought some
strength back into the market.”  The benchmark  10-year note  yield fell three basis points to
2.64 percent at 5:22 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The price of the 2.625 percent notes due in
November 2020 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
29/32. Two-year note yields fell two basis points to 0.43
percent after touching 0.48 percent, the highest since Sept. 17.  Yield Rise  The yield on the current  30-year bond  fell two basis points
to 4.23 percent. The yield earlier touched 4.33 percent, the
highest since May 18 and has increased 11 basis points so far
this week.  The central bank will conduct 18 open-market operations
from Nov. 12 through Dec. 9, according to a statement on the New
York Fed’s website. The central bank is buying an additional
$600 billion of Treasuries through June and expects to reinvest
$250 billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed
debt and agency securities into Treasuries.  “Due to holidays and other scheduling tasks, the $105
billion for the first cycle will be front-loaded into this
Friday to next Friday rather than being smoothly distributed
over calendar time,”  Jim Vogel , head of agency debt research at
FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a note to clients.
“The initial maturity ranges of the first several purchases also
skew a little longer than the average for the next four weeks.”  Spread View  The yield difference between Treasury 10-year notes and 30-
year bonds was 159.7 percentage points, an all-time high. The
spread has averaged 52.8 percentage points since the start of
2000.  More than $442 billion of Treasuries changed hands today
through ICAP Plc, the most since September 2008 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, according to data from the world’s largest inter-
dealer broker. The average daily volume during the past three
months is $285 billion.  “The Fed is going to be a presence in our market just
about every day for the next 30 days,” said  John Briggs , a U.S.
government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s RBS
Securities unit in Stamford, Connecticut, one of 18 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “What the market’s doing is
finally getting it in front of their eyes again, whereas we’d
had supply all week and a tenuous 30-year auction. Now we have
the Fed buybacks, and one is as soon as Friday.”  Auction Results  In the 30-year bond auction, indirect bidders, a class of
investors that includes foreign central banks, bought 38.4
percent of the securities today, compared with 32.4 percent of
the bonds at the October auction and an average for the past 10
sales of 35.03 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.8 percent of
the bonds, compared with an average of 17.8 percent for the past
10 offerings.  “We cheapened all day and it still wasn’t enough to take
down the supply well,” said  George Goncalves , head of interest-
rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc.,  a primary dealer. “This
is not setting a good tone to the market after what were two
good auctions. It’s a warning signal that there are real
concerns about the Fed’s policy, and they are manifesting
themselves.”  Thirty-year bonds have returned 9.9 percent this year,
compared with 8.1 percent for the overall Treasury market as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury sold $24 billion of 10-year notes yesterday at
a yield of 2.636 percent, compared with the average forecast of
2.644 percent in a Bloomberg News survey. The Treasury Nov. 7
sold $32 billion in three-year debt at a yield of 0.575 percent,
compared with the 0.577 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg
News.  The bond market is closed tomorrow in observance of Veterans
Day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
