A bailout of Ireland and Portugal
through the European Financial Stability Facility would resolve
current market tension and not lead to contagion, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The likelihood of Ireland and Portugal entering an IMF-
designed adjustment program funded by the EFSF has, in our view,
increased,” Francesco Garzarelli , chief interest-rate
strategist at Goldman in London, wrote in a research report
today. “Unlike in the aftermath of the Greek ‘bailout,’ we are
of the view that such an outcome will not lead to contagion.
Rather, it may mark a resolution of ongoing European Monetary
Union sovereign tensions.”  Irish bonds  fell for a 12th straight day, widening the
yield spread with benchmark German bunds by 31 basis points to
as much as 586 basis points, the most on record. Portuguese
bonds also fell, widening the yield spread by 11 basis points to
454 basis points, also a record.   To contact the reporter on this story:
