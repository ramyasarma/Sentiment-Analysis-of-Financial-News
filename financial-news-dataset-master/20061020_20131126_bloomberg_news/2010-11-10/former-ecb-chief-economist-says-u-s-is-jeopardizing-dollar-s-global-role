Former European Central Bank chief
economist  Otmar Issing  said the U.S. is jeopardizing the
international role of the dollar if it continues to ignore the
causes of its current account deficit.  “The dollar still is a leading currency but policies in
the U.S. -- if they continue -- are endangering the special
position of the dollar,” Issing said in an interview with
 Deutschlandradio Kultur  broadcast today. “The U.S. has to start
at home. The approach to criticize Germany and make it
responsible for global problems is misleading.”  Issing said he’s “glad” that G-20 leaders meeting in
Seoul this week aren’t aiming for a “quick shot” in reducing
global current-account imbalances. The yuan hasn’t appreciated
enough, Issing added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
