The Australian dollar fell toward a
one-week low as an increase in the nation’s unemployment rate
overshadowed a larger-than-forecast gain in jobs.  The so-called Aussie also dropped against all of its 16
major counterparts after a government report showed the jobless
rate rose to 5.4 percent in October from 5.1 percent in the
previous month. The currency also declined on speculation China
will report today that consumer and producer prices climbed,
adding to concerns the nation will seek to cool economic growth.  “When you get that many people searching for jobs and
there’s only limited supply, what happens is the unemployment
rate increases,” said  Richard Grace , chief currency strategist
in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “You might see a
bit of selling involved, but I don’t think this is a game
changer for the Australian dollar.”  The Australian currency fell to $1.0022 U.S. cents as of
12:03 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0053 in New York yesterday, when it
touched 99.76 cents, the lowest since Nov. 3. It reached $1.0183
on Nov. 5, the most since Australia scrapped foreign-exchange
controls in 1983. The Aussie dropped to 82.37 yen from 82.72 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 78.40 U.S. cents from 78.29. It
touched 77.38 cents yesterday, the weakest since Nov. 3. It
traded at 64.39 yen from 64.42 yen.  The number of people employed in Australia increased 29,700
in October after rising 49,600 in September, the government said.  China’s consumer prices rose 4 percent and producer prices
gained 4.5 percent in October from a year ago, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The People’s Bank of China yesterday raised lenders’
reserve requirements as cash from October’s larger-than-forecast
$27.1 billion trade surplus threatened to add to the risk of
asset bubbles and accelerating inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
