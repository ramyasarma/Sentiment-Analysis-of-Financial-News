Tribune Co.  removed five executives
from a $43 million bonus program because they are being sued
over their roles in the 2007 leveraged buyout blamed by
creditors for the media company’s bankruptcy.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Kevin J. Carey  in Wilmington,
Delaware, today approved paying more than $40 million in bonuses
to about 630 other managers.  Brian J. Gold , a Tribune attorney, today disclosed the
decision to deny the payments to the executives after objections
were lodged by creditors and the Office of the U.S. Trustee, an
arm of the Justice Department that monitors bankruptcies.  “I would have sustained those objections for reasons that
are obvious,” the judge said. “It is wise that the debtor came
to that decision.”  Tribune filed for bankruptcy in 2008, one year after real-
estate billionaire  Sam Zell  led a buyout that added more than
$8 billion in debt onto the Chicago-based newspaper and
television company. Lower-ranking creditors claim the five
executives violated their fiduciary duty to Tribune by pushing
for the buyout.  The creditors sued the executives, Zell and the lenders
behind the buyout, claiming the transaction was a fraudulent
transfer because it left the company insolvent and benefitted
only shareholders, insiders and the lenders.  The five executives are  Chandler Bigelow , Daniel G. Kazan,
Harry Amsden,  Robert Gremillion  and David D. Williams.  The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
