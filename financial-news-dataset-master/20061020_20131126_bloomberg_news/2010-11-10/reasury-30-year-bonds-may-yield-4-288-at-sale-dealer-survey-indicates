The Treasury Department’s $16
billion sale of 30-year bonds may draw a yield of 4.288 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in November 2040, yielded 4.28
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Last month’s long-bond offering drew a yield of 3.852
percent, compared with 3.82 percent at the September auction.  The Oct. 14 sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.49,
versus 2.73 at the September auction of the securities and an
average of 2.7 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 32.4 percent of the bonds at the
October sale. The average for the past 10 offerings was 35
percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.1 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 8.3 percent in
September and an average of 17.8 percent at the past 10
auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 9.9 percent this year,
compared with 8.1 percent for the overall Treasury market as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. is selling $72 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt on Nov. 8 at a
yield of 0.575 percent and $24 billion of 10-year securities
yesterday at a yield of 2.636 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
