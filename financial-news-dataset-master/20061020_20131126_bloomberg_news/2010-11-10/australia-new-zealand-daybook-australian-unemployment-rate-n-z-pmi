An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks halted a two-day slide as energy
shares rose on higher oil prices and Ireland’s central bank
governor said the country may return to bond markets in 2011,
easing concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.
*Chevron Corp. gained 1.6 percent as oil climbed following an
Energy Department report showing an unexpected decrease in crude
stockpiles. Citigroup Inc. rose 3.1 percent, leading a measure
of banks higher. Boeing Co. slid 3 percent after suspending test
flights of the 787 Dreamliner following a fire.

2:15 p.m. in New York, recovering from an earlier decline of as
much as 0.4 percent.
*The Dow average rose 0.1 percent to 11,356.4. Benchmark indexes
reached two-yeah highs last week after the Federal Reserve
expanded its program of asset purchases to stimulate growth, a
tactic known as quantitative easing.  London: European stocks fell the most in two weeks amid renewed
concern that the region’s weakest economies will struggle to
reduce their deficits and as companies from UniCredit SpA to
Natixis SA had worse-than-estimated earnings.
*Banks tumbled as the extra yield investors demand to hold
Irish government bonds instead of German bunds widened to a
record.
*UniCredit, Italy’s biggest lender, tumbled 4.6 percent.
Natixis, the investment-banking unit of Groupe BPCE, sank the
most in 15 months. BHP Billiton Ltd. fell 2.4 percent as copper

271.48 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, declining from the
highest level since September 2008.
*The gauge has climbed 17 percent since May as company earnings
topped estimates and the Federal Reserve unveiled a second round
of asset purchases, a tactic for boosting the economy known as
quantitative easing.  Tokyo: Asian stocks outside Japan fell, dragging down the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index for a second day, as Chinese companies
declined on concern the government will seek to cool asset
inflation. Japanese banks advanced.

market value, jumped 4.2 percent in Tokyo after the Financial
Times said Group of 20 leaders meeting this week may seek to

5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar gained for a second day versus the yen as
U.S. Treasury yields rose following a bond auction that drew
lower-than-average demand, bolstering the appeal of assets
denominated in the currency.

1:39 p.m. in New York, from 81.69 yesterday. The yen depreciated
0.8 percent to 113.37 per euro, from 112.51 yesterday.

*The greenback erased an advance versus the euro as U.S. stocks
reversed losses. The 16-nation currency earlier fell amid
concern that some governments in Europe may struggle to pay
their debt.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries erased declines after the Federal Reserve
announced plans for 18 open-market operations to buy $105
billion of debt during the next 30 days as it expands its policy
of quantitative easing.

May 18.

the prior month to 273,511 metric tons in October, the country’s
customs office said today. Price have surged more than fivefold
