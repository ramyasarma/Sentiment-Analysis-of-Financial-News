A fire at a detention center housing
underage gang members in northern El Salvador that killed 22 and
injured 23 may have been caused by a short circuit, said
 Salvadoran police  spokeswoman Zulma Chicas.  Red Cross spokesman Carlos Mendoza said 10 survivors are in
critical condition and are being hospitalized in the capital,
San Salvador, after receiving treatment in Ilobasco, 53
kilometers (34 miles) northwest of the capital.  Riot police have established order at the Centro Integrado
de Jovenes Infractores de Ilobasco, Chicas said. Preliminary
reports suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit at 5:45
a.m. while inmates were asleep, Chicas said.  “We are investigating what exactly caused the fire,”
Chicas said by phone from San Salvador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
