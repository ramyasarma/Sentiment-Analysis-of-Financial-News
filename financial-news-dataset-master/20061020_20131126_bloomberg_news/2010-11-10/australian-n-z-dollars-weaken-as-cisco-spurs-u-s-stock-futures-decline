The Australian and New Zealand
currencies fell as Cisco Systems Inc. projected less profit than
analysts’ estimates, reducing investor demand for riskier assets
and spurring declines in U.S. stock futures.  The so-called Aussie fell to $1.0029 as of 9:36 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0053 yesterday in New York. The New Zealand
dollar slid 0.4 percent to 77.99 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
