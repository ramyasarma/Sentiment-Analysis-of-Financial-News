Japan and Bolivia agreed to study
plans to jointly develop the world’s largest deposit of lithium
at the Salar de Uyuni salt flat in the South American nation.  State-owned Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. will
provide testing equipment and personnel for a pilot plant being
built by Bolivia, the Japanese agency said today in a  statement 
on its website. The agency signed the agreement with Corporacion
Minera de Bolivia yesterday in La Paz, the statement said.  Japan, South Korea and France are vying to secure supplies
from Uyuni. Demand for lithium, used in battery powered cars and
portable electronics, may triple to about 110,000 metric tons in
the next decade, James D. Calaway, chairman of lithium miner
Orocobre Ltd., said last month.  Jogmec, as the agency is known,  Mitsubishi Corp.  and
 Sumitomo Corp. , Japan’s largest and third-biggest trading
companies, have jointly developed technology to extract lithium
and the agency has proposed sharing the technology with Bolivia.  Bolivia is home to about 5.4 million metric tons of
lithium, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That’s enough
of the metal to make batteries for more than 4.8 billion
electric cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
