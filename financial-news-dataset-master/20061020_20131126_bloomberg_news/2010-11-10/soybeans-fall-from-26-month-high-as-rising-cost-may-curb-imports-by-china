Soybeans fell from a 26-month high
on speculation that this year’s rally will slow purchases of
U.S. exports by China, the world’s biggest consumer.  China imported 3.73 million metric tons in October, down 20
percent from September, customs data show. Imports during the
first 10 months of this year gained 48 percent from a year
earlier. The China National Grain & Oils Information Center said
on Oct. 21 that last month’s shipments would rise to 4.65
million tons. Futures surged 46 percent since the end of June as
Chinese demand expanded.  “Chinese imports are slowing more quickly than expected,”
said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “China has already bought a
lot of soybeans this year, so it’s not surprising to see a
slowdown.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $13.195 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $13.4475,
the highest level for a most-active contract since August 2008.  Food  prices in China, the world’s most populous nation,
climbed 8 percent in September from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Oct. 21.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
