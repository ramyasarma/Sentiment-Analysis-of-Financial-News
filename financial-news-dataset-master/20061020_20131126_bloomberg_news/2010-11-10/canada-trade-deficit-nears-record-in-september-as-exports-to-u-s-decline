Canada’s  trade deficit  widened more
than economists predicted in September, almost matching a record
set two months earlier, as exports to the U.S. fell and imports
reached the highest level in 22 months.  The deficit widened to C$2.49 billion ($2.48 billion) in
September, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today, while
raising its estimate for the August gap to C$1.49 billion from
an initial report of C$1.34 billion. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted a September deficit of C$1.6 billion,
according to the median of 22 estimates.  The deficit was a record C$2.51 billion in July as a
sluggish global economy and a stronger Canadian currency pared
exports and boosted imports. The Bank of Canada  said last month 
the economic recovery will depend more on exports and investment
as government stimulus and consumer spending wane. The bank
forecast trade would lower the economic growth rate by 1.9
percentage points this year and boost it 0.3 point next year.  Trade “is weighing heavily” on the recovery, said BMO
Capital Markets economist  Benjamin Reitzes  by telephone from
Toronto. “Because domestic demand is strong you are getting a
big pull in imports and U.S. growth remains lackluster so
exports really aren’t the growth engine they can be.”  Slowing Growth  Canada’s economic expansion probably slowed to a 1.5
percent annualized pace in the third quarter from 2 percent in
the second, with trade a drag of 3 percentage points, Reitzes
said.  The Canadian dollar climbed 0.3 percent to C$1.0052 per
U.S. dollar at 10:54 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0080
yesterday, when it traded at par with the U.S. dollar for a
third day. One Canadian dollar buys 99.59 U.S. cents.  Exports to the U.S. tumbled 3.6 percent in September on
fewer shipments of passenger vehicles, the lowest since November
2009, Statistics Canada said. Overall  exports  fell 1.7 percent
to C$33.1 billion. The volume of shipments, which removes the
effect of price changes, was 2.2 percent lower while the prices
received for exports rose 0.5 percent.  Canada’s total  imports  rose 1.2 percent to C$35.6 billion,
the highest since November 2008. The gains were led by the two
largest categories, a 5.6 percent increase for industrial goods
and materials, and a 3.2 percent rise for machinery and
equipment. The volume of imports grew 0.1 percent while import
prices rose 1.1 percent, the agency said.  The  trade surplus  with the U.S., Canada’s largest trade
partner, narrowed to C$1.61 billion in September from C$2.85
billion the prior month.  The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in
September as a drop in the dollar pushed exports to the highest
level in two years, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The gap shrank 5.3 percent to $44 billion, smaller
than the $45 billion median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
