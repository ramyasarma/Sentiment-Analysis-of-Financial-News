Thales SA , Europe’s biggest maker of
defense electronics, is in talks with banks to refinance a 1.5
billion-euro ($2.1 billion) credit line, according to three
people with knowledge of the situation.  The company approached a group of eight to 10 lenders to
ask for a similar-sized five-year revolving credit to replace
the loan maturing next year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. Money in a
revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s been repaid.  The initial group of banks may commit around 150 million
euros each towards the financing, two of the people said. More
lenders are expected to join the deal at a lower level,
according to the people.  Thales offered to pay initial interest of 50 basis points
more than benchmark rates on money it draws from the facility,
the people said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A spokeswoman for Neuilly-Sur-Seine, France-based Thales
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment.  BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. were bookrunners on the credit line Thales
is replacing, which was signed in 2004, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company paid initial interest of 20
basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate on that
deal, Bloomberg data show.  Thales is rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB+ by
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
