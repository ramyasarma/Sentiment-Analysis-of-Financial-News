Wah Nam International Holdings Ltd. ,
a Hong Kong-based mining and transport company, offered A$929
million ($931 million) in stock to buy the shares it doesn’t own
in  Brockman Resources Ltd.  and  Ferraus Ltd.  The shares rose.  The offer of 30 shares for each of Brockman’s valued the
Perth-based iron ore company at A$6.47 a share, 36 percent more
than its close yesterday. Wah Nam offered 6 of its shares for
each of Ferraus, the equivalent of A$1.29 a share, Wah Nam said
in a statement. That’s 50 percent higher than yesterday’s close.  Buying the two Australian companies will add Ferraus’s
exploration assets and Brockman’s Marillana iron ore project to
Wah Nam’s copper mine in China. The Hong Kong company said Nov.
3 it was considering buying several mining assets.  “The offer is at a quite significant premium and
illustrates the level of corporate activity in the Australian
resources sector, especially among the mid-cap miners,” said
 Jamie Spiteri , head dealer at Shaw Stockbroking Ltd. “A lot of
the funding for corporate moves is still coming from Asia.”  Ferraus rose 28 percent to A$1.10 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
trade in Sydney, the most in 18 months. Brockman gained 26
percent to A$5.97, the highest in 10 years. Wah Nam climbed 7.1
percent to close the morning session at HK$1.81.  Shareholders should take no action, Brockman said today in
a statement. It’s being advised by UBS AG. Ferraus, which also
told its holders to take no action, is being advised by Gryphon
Partners Pty Ltd. Wah Nam indicated it would lodge its bidders
statement “shortly,” Ferraus said in a statement.  Pilbara Region  Wah Nam, with a market value of HK$7.1 billion ($912
million), already owns respective stakes of 22.63 percent and
19.8 percent in  Brockman  and Ferraus. The company will trade
its shares on the Australian exchange should the offers succeed,
said Wah Nam, which is being advised by OSK Capital Hong Kong
Ltd. and Capital Investment Partners.  Brockman’s Marillana iron ore project in Australia’s
Pilbara region is scheduled to start output in 2013 and reach
annual production of 17 million metric tons to 20 million tons
of iron ore a year, the company said on its website. Ferraus
also owns iron ore exploration assets in the Pilbara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
