Madagascar’s security forces used
tear gas today to remove opposition party members who were
protesting in the capital against a constitutional referendum
planned for next week.  Police banned public gatherings by all political parties
not registered before the Nov. 17 vote, according to a notice
published in local newspapers on the Indian Ocean island nation
yesterday.  Fetison Rakoto Andrianirina, head of the TIM party loyal to
former President  Marc Ravalomanana , said they were not told
about the ban in time to stop their own advertisements of the
rally at a sports stadium in Antananarivo.  The government hopes the new constitution will end a
political and economic crisis after President  Andry Rajoelina 
ousted Ravalomanana last year. Opposition parties are refusing
to take part because the constitution was developed from a
September national conference that they boycotted, Andrianirina
said in a phone interview today.  The parties will “carry on demonstrating until this
referendum is canceled,” he said.  Military Colonel Richard Ravalomanana said in a phone
interview today that the protestors were trying to “prevent the
referendum by destabilizing the peace.” He said six
demonstrators were arrested and two vehicles set on fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
