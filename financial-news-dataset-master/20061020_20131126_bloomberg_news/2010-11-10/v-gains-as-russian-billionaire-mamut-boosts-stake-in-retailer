HMV Group Plc , the music and DVD
retailer that owns Waterstone’s bookstores, rose as much as 4.9
percent in London trading after Russian billionaire  Alexander Mamut  increased his stake to more than 3 percent.  Mamut’s purchase yesterday “highlights the huge valuation
anomaly in the shares,”  Nick Bubb , an analyst at Arden Partners
Plc, said today in a note. “An investment of 5 million pounds
is chicken-feed to Mamut at this stage, but his ultimate
intentions are unclear.”  HMV rose 2.72 percent to 47.25 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close
in London, giving it a market value of 200.1 million pounds
($322 million). The Maidenhead, England-based company’s stock
had slumped 49 percent this year.  HMV is adding loyalty cards and diversifying into live
music venues and festivals to boost  sales  as competition
increases from supermarkets and online retailers.  Mamut’s experience in the technology market may lead him to
think that HMV’s online investments are “under-recognized and
underpin the value of the business at this ultra-low level,”
Bubb said.  Mamut bought 000 Evroset, the Russian mobile-phone retailer
that controls about a third of the country’s market, in 2008 and
sold a 49.9 percent stake to OAO VimpelCom for $226 million.
Mamut and other investors bought OAO Polymetal, Russia’s biggest
silver producer, in 2008. His net worth was estimated at $1.5
billion by Forbes Magazine in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
