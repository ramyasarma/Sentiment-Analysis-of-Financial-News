Cuba’s Communist Party leaders called
for debate on letting state-owned companies die off and on
ending a dual currency system, EFE reported.  Party leaders, in a 32-page document published today, also
called for the country to reduce its dependence on imports, EFE
said. The paper was released to kick start debate among Cubans
on economic reforms ahead of a Communist Party congress set for
next April, the first since 1997, the Spanish newswire reported.  The document defends socialism as the only political system
capable of leading the island through its economic crisis and
suggested any reforms will not include political change, EFE
said.  In September, Cuba announced it will dismiss 500,000 state
workers, or about 10 percent of the workforce, as the island
faces the worst economic slump since the former Soviet Union
ended support in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
