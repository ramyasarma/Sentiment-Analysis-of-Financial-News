Deputy financial chiefs from Group
of 20 nations are still debating currency and current account
issues in the lead up to the Seoul summit, said Kim Yoon Kyung,
a spokesman for South Korea’s G-20 preparation committee.
Controversy over currencies has been greater than expected and

wording of draft documents for their leaders, Kim told reporters
in Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
