A European Union decision to fine 11
airlines a total of $1.1 billion for coordinating air-cargo fuel
and security surcharges should lead to a quicker resolution of
an Australian lawsuit seeking compensation on behalf of
businesses in the country, a law firm said.  “The airlines have been trying to deny that there is a
case to answer in this country,”  Brooke Dellavedova , a
principal at the class-action law firm  Maurice Blackburn , said
in an e-mailed statement. “Given Australia’s geographic
isolation and our reliance on international air freight there is
no doubt that Australian businesses were affected.”  Air France-KLM Group ,  British Airways Plc  and Qantas
Airways Ltd. were among the airlines fined yesterday by the
European Commission. The fines were issued three years after
regulators sent complaints to 26 airlines, following coordinated
antitrust raids worldwide that led to jail terms for some
executives, fines and settlements. U.S. authorities have fined
18 airlines at least $1.6 billion and filed criminal charges
against 14 executives for price-fixing.  Maurice Blackburn sued seven airlines including Qantas and
British Airways on behalf of Australian businesses, claiming
they were overcharged on air-cargo shipments.  In August, a full panel of the Federal Court of Australia,
overturned a judge’s ruling dismissing the lawsuit and allowed
it to proceed.  A hearing is scheduled in Melbourne on Nov. 22.  The case is Between Auskay International Manufacturing &
Trade Ltd. and Qantas Airways Ltd. VID903/2009 and VID48/2010.
