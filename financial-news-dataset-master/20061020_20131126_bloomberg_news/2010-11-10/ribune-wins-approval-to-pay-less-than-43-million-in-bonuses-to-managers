Tribune Co. won approval to split
less than $43 Million in bonuses to hundreds of managers after
the bankrupt media company denied payments to five executives
who were sued for their roles in a 2007 leveraged buyout.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey said in Wilmington,
Delaware, that he planned to approve the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
