Hochtief AG , Germany’s biggest
construction company, which is trying to ward off a takeover bid
by Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA, said it will
revive plans to raise money by shedding stakes in some units.  The Essen-based builder aims to sell a majority stake in
Hochtief Concessions in 2011 and a stake in Aurelis Real Estate
GmbH “as early as 2012,” a year earlier than previously
announced, the company said in an e-mailed statement.
Hochtief shelved a planned initial public offering in the
concessions unit last year citing the Dubai financial crisis.  In the statement, the builder said it expects to report
earnings before tax of about one billion euros ($1.38 billion)
in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. It forecasts
consolidated net income of about 600 million euros in 2011,
about 500 million euros in 2012 and about 450 million euros in
2013, it also said.  The construction company seeks to boost its share value in
a restructuring program to make ACS’s bid more expensive, the
Rheinische Post newspaper said in a report. Hochtief may cut 
its operating divisions to three or four from six, saving 
about 40 million euros ($55 million) a year from 2012, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  ACS owns about 30 percent of Hochtief and plans to raise
its stake to slightly more than 50 percent over time. It made a
mandatory offer of eight of its own shares for five Hochtief
shares in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
