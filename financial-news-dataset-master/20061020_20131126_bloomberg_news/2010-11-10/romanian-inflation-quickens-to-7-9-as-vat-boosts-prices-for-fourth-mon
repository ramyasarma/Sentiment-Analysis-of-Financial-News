Romania’s  inflation  rate rose for a
fourth consecutive month in October as the lingering effects of
a 5 percentage-point increase in the value-added tax pushed
prices higher throughout the economy.  The rate advanced to 7.9 percent, the highest since August
2008, from 7.8 percent in September, the Bucharest-based
 National Statistics Institute  said today in an e-mail. On the
month, prices advanced 0.55 percent.  Romania raised VAT to 24 percent in July to meet a budget
deficit target of 6.8 percent of gross domestic product for this
year and 4.4 percent for 2011. The country turned to the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union for a 20
billion-euro ($27.6 billion) bailout during the worst recession
in 20 years.  The central bank on Nov. 4 raised its inflation forecast to
8.2 percent for this year and 3.4 percent for 2011. That
compares with August estimates of 7.8 percent and 3.1 percent.  Food price inflation accelerated to an annual 5.5 percent
in October compared with 4.8 percent in September, the institute
said. Prices for services rose an annual 6.1 percent, compared
with 6.4 percent in September, and non-food prices gained 10.6
percent, compared with 10.7 percent the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
