The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate, a
gauge of inflation expectations, rose after the Bank of England
said a “near-term overshoot” of its price target may be “more
pronounced” if commodity prices continue to rise.  The breakeven rate rose 3 basis points to 2.89 percent as
of 11 a.m. in London. It’s derived from the yield difference
between index-linked and regular bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
