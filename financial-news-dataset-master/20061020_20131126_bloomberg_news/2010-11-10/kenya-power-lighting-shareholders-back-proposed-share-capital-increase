Shareholders of  Kenya Power &
Lighting Co. , the East African country’s monopoly power
distributor, approved a proposed rights offer, share split and
conversion of preference stock, Chairman Eliazar Ochola said.  The proposals, including an eight-for-one share split, were
voted on at a shareholders meeting today in Nairobi, the
capital. The price at which stock will be sold to existing
shareholders will be determined by the company’s board within
two weeks, Managing Director  Joseph Njoroge  said at the meeting.  Kenya Power plans to raise as much as 10 billion shillings
($124.1 million) in the offer, which opens on Nov. 25 and closes
on Dec. 15, Njoroge said on Oct. 28. The funds will be invested
in the refurbishment and development of the country’s power
distribution network, he said.  Shares in KPLC , as the company is known, were unchanged
today after falling 0.6 percent to 218 shillings yesterday. The
stock has gained 56 percent this year, outperforming a 42
percent advance in the  NSE-20 Index  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
