What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that U.S. export
demand will ease after prices climbed to a 26-month high, said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the dollar’s rally against a basket of major
currencies erodes the appeal of U.S. exports, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents lower in Chicago
after China’s imports slowed last month, Grow said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $4 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open down 0.05 cent to 0.1 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
