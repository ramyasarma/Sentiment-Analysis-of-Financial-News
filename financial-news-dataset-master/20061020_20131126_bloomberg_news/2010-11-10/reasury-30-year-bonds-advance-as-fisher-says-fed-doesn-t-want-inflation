Treasury 30-year bonds declined amid
speculation that demand may decline at today’s $16 billion
auction with the Federal Reserve focusing purchases on shorter-
maturity debt.  The previous 30-year bond sale drew a higher-than-forecast
yield and saw lower demand than the average of recent auctions,
as Treasury completes $72 billion of note and bond sales this
week. The bonds earlier rose for the first time in six days as
investors sought the safety of U.S. debt as bond yields tumbled
in Ireland, Greece and Portugal. The Fed plans to reveal details
of its extended quantitative easing plan to buy Treasuries to
bolster the economy.  “The auction results will tell us if anyone cares at these
levels,” said  Larry Dyer , a U.S. interest rate strategist with
HSBC Holdings PLC’s HSBC Securities unit in New York, one of 18
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “You want to see real-
money demand that can hold bonds over time. You need a
fundamental value to get them well placed.”  The yield on the 30-year bond rose four basis points to
4.29 percent at 12:11 p.m., the highest since June 3, according
to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.875 percent security due in
August 2040 fell 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 93
3/32.  The yield on the 10-year note rose eight basis points to
2.74 percent.  European Bonds  The Irish bond headed for its longest losing streak in at
least three years, sending the yield difference, or spread, over
benchmark German 10-year debt to a record. Ten-year Portuguese
yields jumped 28 basis points to 7.20 percent, while Greek and
Spanish bonds also slumped. Bunds fell as a sale of two-year
notes attracted the lowest demand since May.  “We’ve had some substantial peripheral spread widening and
that has contributed to a rally in Treasuries, from earlier lows
as the focus in the market is turning,” said  Christopher Bury ,
co-head of fixed-income rates at Jefferies & Co. in New York,
one of the 18 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “People
are keeping an eye on the European situation, and an eye on the
auction and Fed announcement, and it is contributing to the
volatility.”  Yield Spread  The yield  difference  between Treasury 10-year notes and 30-
year bonds touched 154.88 percentage points, near the all-time
high of 159 percentage points, which it touched yesterday. The
spread has averaged 52.8 percentage points since the start of
2000.  The previous 30-year bond sale on Oct. 14 was weaker than
forecast, drawing a yield of 3.852, higher than the average
estimate of 3.831 percent in a Bloomberg News survey. Investors
 bid  for 2.49 times the amount of debt available at a sale of 30-
year securities last month, versus an average of 2.70 for the
past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 32.4 percent of the securities, lower
than the 35.81 percent average of the past 10 auctions  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.1 percent of
the bonds, compared with 17.61 percent at the 10 previous sales
of the debt.  Fed Plans  Today, the Fed plans to reveal details about its plan
announced last week to buy an additional $600 billion in
government debt to support the economy. It bought $1.7 trillion
of assets from December 2008 through March.  The Fed said in a statement Nov. 3 at the end of a two-day
Federal Open Market Committee gathering that it will make 4
percent of its purchases in the 17- to 30-year sector, less than
the other sectors.  “We are seeing a pretty sharp selloff,” said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income and
currencies at the primary dealer Royal Bank of Canada in New
York. “Some of this represents some illiquidity in the market
and reduced appetite to take risk with the inexperience of QE
trading still setting in and before the Fed Purchase schedule is
known.”  The Fed has been reinvesting the principal payments from
its holdings of mortgage securities in Treasuries. The Fed has
bought $75.845 billion of Treasuries since it began the program
on Aug. 17. Policy makers are seeking to keep holdings in the
System Open Market Account at about $2 trillion by using the
proceeds of principal payments from its agency mortgage-backed
securities and agency debt.  Yesterday, Treasury sold $24 billion of 10-year notes at a
yield of 2.636 percent, compared with the average forecast of
2.644 percent in a Bloomberg News survey. Treasury Nov. 7 sold
$32 billion in three-year debt at a yield of 0.575 percent,
compared with 0.577 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
