OAO EuroSibEnergo, Russian
billionaire  Oleg Deripaska’s  power utility, plans to seek $1.5
billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong by the end of
the year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  EuroSibEnergo plans to sell a 25 percent stake, the person
said, declining to be identified because the information hasn’t
been made public. The company will start meeting with potential
investors next week, the person said.  “This valuation looks a little bit expensive compared to
its emerging-markets hydro-generator peers,” Alexander
Seleznev, an analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said by phone.
“An IPO would improve transparency because it would show the
detailed accounts of both its main assets, IrkutskEnergo and
Krasnoyarsk Hydro Power Plant.”  The sale would be the second by a company controlled by
Deripaska in Hong Kong this year.  United Co. Rusal , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, raised about $2.2 billion in January
in the first IPO in China by a Russian company.  Rusal’s stock lost 30 percent from its listing in January
to its low for the year reached on June 18. The shares have
rebounded and are now up 8.9 percent for 2010.  EuroSibEnergo sells more than half its electricity to Rusal
and is Russia’s second-largest hydropower producer after OAO
RusHydro. Deripaska owns EuroSibEnergo via the same EN+ Group
holding company that holds his 48 percent stake in Rusal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
