Oil recovered from earlier losses as
the dollar slumped against the euro, countering signs of
sputtering demand in the U.S. and China, the world’s biggest
energy users.  Crude for December delivery rose as much as 32 cents to
$87.04 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $86.96 at 8:38 a.m. London time. Earlier,
the contract fell as much as 55 cents to $86.17.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
