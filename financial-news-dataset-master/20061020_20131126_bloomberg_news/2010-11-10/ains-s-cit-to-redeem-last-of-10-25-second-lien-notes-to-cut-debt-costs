CIT Group Inc. , the business lender
led by  John A. Thain , will repay the last $752 million of its
10.25 percent second-lien notes as the company reduces high-cost
debt left from its bankruptcy last year.  CIT intends to complete the redemption Jan. 4, resolving
the last of $2.15 billion of Series B notes, the New York-based
firm said today in a statement. The company said it will pay 102
percent of the principal amount for the $752 million of notes.  “The redemption of all our Series B Notes is another
milestone in our post-restructuring efforts,” said Thain, the
chief executive officer, in the statement. “Once complete, we
will have extinguished more than $6.5 billion of high-cost debt
over a twelve month period.”  Thain, 55, has been using cash from asset sales and
customer repayments of loans to reduce CIT’s debt. To overhaul
the business, he’s upgrading risk-management systems and
negotiating with federal regulators for permission to take more
low-cost deposits through a bank subsidiary to fund lending.  CIT repaid $4.5 billion of first-lien debt and refinanced
another $3 billion at lower rates earlier this year, it said.  Before seeking bankruptcy protection last year, the lender
had relied on the short-term capital markets, which dried up for
the company after losses from bad loans, including  subprime
mortgages . The firm’s debt was reduced by more than 20 percent
to $43.3 billion in the bankruptcy, which wiped out $2.3 billion
of government bailout money.  CIT had $35.9 billion of long-term borrowings as of Sept.
30, according to a company filing.  CIT fell 76 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $42.94 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock is up 56
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
