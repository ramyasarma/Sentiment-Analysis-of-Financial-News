California Public Employees
Retirement System, the largest public pension in the U.S., plans
to invest $500 million in companies working on curbing
greenhouse-gas emissions and improving the environment.  The internally managed fund mimics  HSBC Holdings Plc ’s
 Global Climate Change Benchmark Index . Calpers said it will
target companies with “a material portion” of sales from
alternative-energy production and conservation; water, waste and
pollution control; or finance activities such as carbon trading.
The HSBC-based model includes 380 securities, Calpers said.  “This new index has kept pace with non-environmental
investments in recent years, and has outperformed our external
environmental managers who have focused solely on excluding
polluting companies from their portfolios,”  George Diehr ,
Calpers investment committee chairman, said in the statement.  The $221.5 billion pension fund, which earned 13.3 percent
on its holdings in the past fiscal year, has placed $500 million
since 2006 with external managers who won’t invest in
“polluting companies,” Diehr said. The Sacramento-based plan
also has poured $1.5 billion into private-equity firms that
target companies working on environmental technologies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
