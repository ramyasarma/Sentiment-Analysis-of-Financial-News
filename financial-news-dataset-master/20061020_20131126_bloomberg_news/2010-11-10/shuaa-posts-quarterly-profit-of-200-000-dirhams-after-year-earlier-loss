Shuaa Capital PSC , the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest investment bank, reported a third-quarter
profit after posting a loss in the year-ago period as it
restructured and focused on its fee-generating business.  Net income for the period was 200,000 dirhams ($54,455),
compared with a 269 million-dirham  loss  a year ago, the Dubai-
based bank said in a statement on the Dubai bourse website
today.  Shuaa’s nine-month loss narrowed to 36.9 million dirhams
from 375.5 million a year ago and the bank reduced its
liabilities by 206.1 million dirhams, it said. Total assets were
2.18 billion dirhams at the end of the third quarter, including
a cash reserve of 412 million dirhams.  The results are “clear proof that the company’s turnaround
is on track,”  Sameer Al Ansari , Shuaa’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “Our balance sheet is strong,
de-risked and underleveraged. Our excellent liquidity position
will allow us to reinvest and focus on the growth of our core
businesses, most of which have recorded profits this quarter.”  Dubai’s DFM General Index has tumbled 21 percent this year,
while average daily volumes have dropped 65 percent to 161
million, compared with the year-earlier period, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shuaa’s  asset management and investment banking units
returned to profit, while the bank’s private equity and finance
divisions remained profitable, it said. Revenue from Shuaa’s
investment banking activities rose to 6.9 million dirhams from
2.4 million dirhams a year earlier. Net profit rose to 2.9
million from 400,000 dirhams.  Saudi Arabia is a “key part” of Shuaa’s growth plans and
the bank said it is “well positioned to build and further
solidify” its presence in the region’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
