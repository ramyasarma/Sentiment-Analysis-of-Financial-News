Municipal debt yields rose in most
maturities yesterday, with rates on  top-rated tax-exempt  debt
due in 20 years climbing to the highest level since July.  Twenty-year AAA general obligations jumped about 0.13
percentage point today to 3.69 percent, according to the
Bloomberg Valuation index for that maturity. States and
municipalities had planned to sell $11.2 billion in municipal
debt this week, the most since Oct. 29, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That means many issuers must offer
greater yield to persuade investors to buy their debt.  The market is having trouble absorbing sales in a week
shortened by the Veterans Day holiday in the U.S., said  Jim Holihan , a portfolio manager at New York-based Evercore Partners
LLC.  “It’s a lot of supply to come in four days,” said
Holihan, who helps oversee about $1 billion in municipal
securities. “We haven’t handled it well.”  Yields on  two-year AAA debt  fell for a second-straight day,
dropping 1 basis point to 0.44 percent after touching 0.42
percent, the lowest since Sept. 22, according to a two-year
Bloomberg Valuation index. The  difference in yield  between 2-and
30-year bonds is 3.75 percentage points, the most since June 28,
Bloomberg Valuation data show.  Investors are making defensive moves against possible
inflation being brought about by the Federal Reserve’s expansion
of its policy of buying long-term securities to bolster the
economy, Holihan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
