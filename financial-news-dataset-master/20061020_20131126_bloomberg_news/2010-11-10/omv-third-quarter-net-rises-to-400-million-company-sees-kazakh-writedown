OMV AG , central Europe’s biggest oil
company, said third-quarter profit rose 12 percent, beating
analyst estimates.  Net income excluding costs of revaluing inventories rose 12
percent to 290 million euros ($400 million), or 97 cents a
share, from 259 million euros, or 87 cents, a year earlier, the
Vienna-based company said in a statement on its website today.
Analysts had expected profit to fall to 249 million euros,
according to the median of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  OMV said last month that it would take a charge of about
250 million euros in the third quarter, mainly for writedowns on
two underperforming oil and gas fields in Austria and
Kazakhstan. The two fields also hurt OMV’s production, with the
company expecting to miss its 2010 production target of 325,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2 to 3 percent.  The company last month agreed to take over Turkey’s biggest
fuel retailer, Petrol Ofisi, by buying a 54 percent stake from
Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS for 1 billion euros, taking its
holding to 96 percent. Once the transaction closes, which OMV
said in October would likely be within three months, the company
expects a writedown on its original 41.58 percent stake in
Petrol Ofisi, according to today’s statement.  The “existing book value per share” will be reduced to
the “price payable per share for the 54.17 percent” OMV agreed
to acquire last month, while it had previously been reported at
equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
