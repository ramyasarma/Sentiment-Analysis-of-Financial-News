Kansai Paint Co. , Japan’s biggest
paint maker, said first-half profit rose 70 percent on demand in
India and China. The shares fell after the company reiterated an
annual forecast that was less than analysts’ estimates.  Net income climbed to 7.32 billion yen ($89 million), from
4.3 billion yen a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Sales rose to 120.4 billion yen from 103.8 billion
yen, aided by a 20 percent increase in Asia outside Japan.  Kansai Paint, which has been accumulating a stake in South
African rival  Freeworld Coatings Ltd. , is considering other
acquisitions, President  Yuzo Kawamori  said today at a briefing
in Osaka, where the company is based.  “We want to scour the four corners of the globe” to find
good companies, he said. “We are extremely interested in
growing markets.”  Kawamori said his company now owns 27.6 percent of
Freeworld, which manufactures household and automotive paint,
making it a subsidiary. He declined to say whether Kansai Paint
would seek a bigger share of the company, based in Paulshof in
northern Johannesburg.  Kansai Paint left its full-year earnings outlook unchanged
at 13.1 billion yen, short of the 13.7 billion yen average of
four analysts’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.  Shares Drop  The  shares , which had risen in the morning, fell the most
in 18 months after the earnings results were announced at the
noon trading break in Japan. They closed 5.4 percent lower at
740 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since
April 28, 2009. The benchmark  Nikkei  225 Stock Average added 1.4
percent.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, rose 47 percent to 11.8 billion yen in
the first-half, beating the 11.7 billion yen average of four
analysts’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. The gain in revenue
in the period was less than the analysts’ average estimate of
121.3 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
