Verizon Communications Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. phone carrier, increased  Lowell McAdam ’s
salary by 70 percent to $1.4 million following his promotion to
chief operating officer from head of its wireless unit.  McAdam, 56, was previously making a base salary of
$825,000, New York-based Verizon said today in a regulatory
filing. The changes went into effect this month.  Verizon has named McAdam as a likely successor to Chief
Executive Officer  Ivan Seidenberg  when the 63-year-old CEO
retires. Under McAdam’s leadership at Verizon Wireless, the unit
has grown through  customer  wins and acquisitions to become the
largest mobile-phone service provider in the country. The mobile
division also has become Verizon’s biggest source of  revenue  and
profit as traditional home-phone customers have declined.  McAdam’s potential short-term bonus was increased to 187.5
percent of his base salary from 112.5 percent, Verizon said. His
long-term incentive package, which includes company shares, was
increased to a possible 625 percent of his salary from 525
percent. The combined pay could give McAdam as much as $12.8
million in compensation.  Francis Shammo , who was promoted to  chief financial officer 
in September, was awarded a $75,000 increase to his $600,000
base salary, according to the filing.  Verizon  declined  16 cents to $32.85 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 4:04 p.m. The stock has gained 6.1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
