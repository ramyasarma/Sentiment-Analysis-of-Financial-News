African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. , the
miner part-owned by South Africa’s first black billionaire,
boosted Chairman  Patrice Motsepe’s  total remuneration by 74
percent last year even as profit declined.  Motsepe, who indirectly owns about 40 percent of the
platinum, copper and nickel producer, was paid 11.72 million
rand ($1.7 million) in the 12 months through June, including an
accrued bonus of 5.75 million rand. In March,  Forbes Magazine 
estimated his net worth at $2.3 billion.  The remuneration of  Andre Wilkens , the company’s chief
executive officer, rose 86 percent to 12.96 million rand during
the 12 months, including a salary of 4.86 million rand and a
bonus of 6.81 million rand, the company said in its  annual
report  posted on its website today. In addition, Motsepe and
Wilkens were awarded 13,079 and 13,154 performance shares,
respectively.  Higher bonuses were paid after production rose and costs
fell, ARM said. Metals prices in the local currency were also
higher than expected, contributing to earnings that beat the
company’s own targets, it said.  Still, ARM’s  profit dropped  37 percent during the year, it
said in August. The company paid shareholders a dividend of 2
rand per share for the period.  ARM fell 82 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 196.99 rand as of
12:53 p.m. in Johannesburg, reducing the gain during the past 12
months to 24 percent. That lags behind the  FTSE 350 Mining
Index’s  34 percent advance and beats the FTSE/JSE Africa Mining
Index’s 15 percent increase.  ARM expects a “serious” deficit in platinum group metals
and copper in the “medium to long term,” Wilkens said in the
report. The company plans to increase its exposure to copper to
benefit from improved prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
