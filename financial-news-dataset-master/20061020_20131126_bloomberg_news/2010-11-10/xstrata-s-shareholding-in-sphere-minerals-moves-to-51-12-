Xstrata Plc , the biggest thermal
coal exporter, moved closer to completing the A$514 million
($516 million) takeover of Sphere Minerals Ltd. after more than
half of the iron ore developer’s shareholders accepted the offer.  Xstrata now holds 51.12 percent of Sphere, according to a
regulatory filing sent to the Australian stock exchange. Genesis
Investment Management, with 7.98 percent of the company, agreed
to the bid, Sphere said yesterday.  Xstrata is seeking to create an iron ore division to
compete with larger rivals  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and  Rio Tinto Group ,
who generate their largest sales from the steelmaking raw
material. BHP, Rio and Vale SA, the biggest iron ore company,
control about three-quarters of world trade in the commodity.  Sphere has three projects in Mauritania, including half of
the $1.65 billion Guelb el Aouj development. Xstrata, based in
Zug, Switzerland, has agreed to spend as much as $106 million on
an initial study of the Republic of Congo’s Zanaga site.  Xstrata has offered A$3 per share for Sphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
