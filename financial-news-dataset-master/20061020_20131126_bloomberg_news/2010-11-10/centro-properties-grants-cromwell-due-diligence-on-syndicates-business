Centro Properties Group , the
Australian shopping-mall owner that ceded control to creditors
in 2008, has granted property trust Cromwell Group the right to
conduct exclusive due diligence on its MCS Syndicates funds
management business.  The decision follows “a detailed and extensive” process
by Centro that has sought interest from several interested
parties, Centro Chief Executive Officer  Robert Tsenin  said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange today.  “The potential transaction, should it proceed, will
continue to provide a superior service to investors, and create
value for all our stakeholders,” Tsenin said.  Centro, which manages an A$18.6 billion collection of 712
shopping centers in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., said in
July it was seeking partners for its unlisted funds management
business, after restructuring and extending A$2.7 billion of
debt. The group, which had A$18.4 billion of debt as of June 30,
is also seeking buyers for more than A$4 billion of assets,
according to a person familiar with the situation.  The Melbourne-based company said on Nov. 4 that a number of
parties have approached it with expressions of interest in its
business and assets.  Any transaction following the due diligence by Brisbane-
based Cromwell is subject to obtaining the required consents and
approvals, Centro said. Centro MCS is the direct property
division of Centro Properties and manages investments in 35
syndicates with a value of A$3.2 billion in Australia and $2.5
billion in the U.S., according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
