Sri Lanka’s parliament today voted
to approve a bill to legalize gambling, a move that may attract
casino developers eager to profit from tourists flocking to the
island after the end of its civil war.  The Gaming Special Provisions Bill will “provide for the
designation of areas in which persons interested to start the
business of gaming can set up their establishments,” according
to the legislature’s  website .  Billionaire  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala -backed Delta Corp. said Oct.
4 that it plans to open casinos in Sri Lanka in the next six
months to tap a surge in visitors after the end of the nation’s
26-year war with Tamil rebels. Sri Lanka’s tourist arrivals rose
44 percent in the first nine months of the year, according to
the nation’s tourism agency.  Sri Lanka’s $42 billion economy may grow as much as 8
percent in 2010, the central bank said on Sept. 21. The nation’s
troops defeated the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
in May last year, ending their quest for a separate homeland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
