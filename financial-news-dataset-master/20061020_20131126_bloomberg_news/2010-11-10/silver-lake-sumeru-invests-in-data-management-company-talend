Silver Lake Sumeru , a division of
the private-equity firm that focuses on midsize businesses, made
an investment in  Talend , a company that aims to help customers
save money by managing their data more efficiently.  Talend, run out of Los Altos, California, and Paris, has
240 employees and 1,500 customers, including  EBay Inc. , Virgin
Mobile and Sony Corp., according to a statement today. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Talend relies on open-source software to manage companies’
data, meaning it uses code that’s freely developed by a
collective of programmers. The company most recently  raised  $8
million in April, for a total of $28 million. At the same time
as the Silver Lake deal, Talend announced that it has purchased
Sopera, a provider of open-source middleware -- software that
helps different systems communicate.  In August, Talend announced that  Nick White  would be
joining the company as chief financial officer. He was
previously finance chief of SpringSource Inc., which was
acquired by VMware Inc. in 2009.  Silver Lake, based in Menlo Park, California, has more than
$14 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
