China will become “more
aggressive” in increasing borrowing costs and continue ordering
banks to set aside more reserves to tackle accelerating
inflation, according to  Jun Ma  at Deutsche Bank AG.  The country may allow a faster appreciation of the yuan,
increase subsidies for low-income households and farmers, and
possibly delay price increases for power, gas, water, oil and
public transport, Ma, chief economist for Greater China at
Deutsche Bank, said in the report.  The central bank may raise  interest rates  by 75 basis
points in the coming 12 months and there may be price controls
on grains and cotton, the report said.  Supermarkets, restaurants, agriculture, apparel and cement
may benefit from rising inflation, while power producers and
some residential property developers are “potential victims”
of government policies to tackle rising prices, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
