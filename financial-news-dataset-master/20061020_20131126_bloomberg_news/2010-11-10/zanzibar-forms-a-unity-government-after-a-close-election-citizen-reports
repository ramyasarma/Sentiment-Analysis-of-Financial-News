Zanzibar formed a unity government
that includes  Seif Sharif Hamad  of the opposition Civic United
Front as vice-president, the  Citizen  reported, citing a
Abdulhimid Yahya Mzee, secretary to the Revolutionary Council.  Zanzibar approved a constitutional change to allow for a
power-sharing government in a referendum in July, the Dar es
Salaam-based newspaper reported today. Under the agreement, the
two parties in a unity government will negotiate how to divide
up ministerial posts, it said.  President  Ali Mohamed Shein  of the ruling Chama cha
Mapinduzi party won 50.1 percent of the vote in the Oct. 31
election, with Hamad winning 49.1 percent, the Citizen said,
citing official election results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
