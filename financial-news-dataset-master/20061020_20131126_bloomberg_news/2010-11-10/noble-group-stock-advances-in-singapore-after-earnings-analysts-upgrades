Noble Group Ltd., the Singapore-
based commodities supplier backed by China’s sovereign wealth
fund, rose to the highest in almost eight months in Singapore
trading after it posted a 19 percent rise in third-quarter
profit and brokers upgraded the stock.  The  shares  rose as much as 1.9 percent to S$2.17, the
highest since March 22, and were trading at S$2.16 as of 9.49
a.m. on the local stock exchange. The key index fell 0.5 percent.  Noble was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at
CIMB-GK Securities with a 12-month target price of S$2.45 per
share. Credit Suisse also raised its rating to “outperform”
from “neutral” and increased its share-price estimate to
S$2.55 from S$1.65. Phillip Securities raised its rating to
“buy” from “hold” and set its target price at S$2.33.  Net income  rose to $157.2 million, or 2.53 cents a share,
in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $132.1 million, or 2.47
cents, a year earlier, yesterday in a statement to the local
stock exchange.  Sales for the quarter rose 79 percent to $14.94 billion,
lifting the nine-month revenue by 82 percent to a record $39.26
billion, it said. Noble, which received almost three quarters of
its gross profit last year from energy and agriculture
operations, is benefitting as crude oil, corn and soybean prices
hover at two-year highs, while cotton is at a record.  “Higher revenue levels reflected the impact of a more
stable economic environment which returned commodity price
levels to more normalized levels,” the company said yesterday.  Noble wants to grow its grain and oilseeds businesses to
take advantage of rising global food demand, Chief Executive
Officer  Ricardo Leiman  said Sept. 28. It aims to double annual
profit to $1 billion in three years as consumption of sugar,
grains, coal and other resources increases in Asia.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
