Group of 20 governments have
complied with 64 percent of the policy commitments they made in
June, according to an academic study.  The performance is better than the 62 percent compliance
following the 2009 summits in London and Pittsburgh, according
to a  report  today from the G20 Research Group at the University
of Toronto and the G8 Research Centre at the University Higher
School of Economics in Moscow.  Canada, the U.K. and Australia all fulfilled more than 80
percent of the goals set in Toronto in June, with India the
weakest performer at 40 percent. A total of 95 percent of the
pledges made on reforming international financial institutions
were met, while financial regulation was one of the topics on
which there was the weakest delivery, with 53 percent of the
aims satisfied.  G-20  leaders begin their fifth summit tomorrow in Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
