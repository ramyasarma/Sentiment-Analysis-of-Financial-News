The number of Americans filing
initial jobless claims last week fell to the lowest level in
four months, reinforcing evidence the U.S. labor market is
healing.  Applications for jobless  benefits  declined by 24,000 to
435,000 in the week ended Nov. 6, lower than the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The total number of people collecting
unemployment insurance fell to the lowest level since November
2008, and those receiving extended payments also declined.  Fewer firings are a first step to improvement in the labor
market, followed by faster job and income growth that will help
fuel gains in consumer spending. Bigger increases in payrolls
are also required to bring down an  unemployment  rate that’s
close to 10 percent.  “This is further confirmation that the job market is
slowly improving,” said  Russell Price , a senior economist at
Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit. “We are now headed in the
right direction and may make some progress in breaking free of
the range we’ve been stuck in since the beginning of the year.”  Stock-index futures erased earlier losses and Treasury
securities dropped after the report. Futures on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent to 1,212.3 at 8:46 a.m. in New
York. The yield on the 10-year note, which moves inversely to
price, rose to 2.71 percent from 2.66 percent late yesterday.  Trade Gap  The Commerce Department said today that the trade deficit
narrowed to $44 billion in September from $46.5 billion a month
earlier. Import prices in October rose 0.9 percent, Labor
Department figures showed.  Jobless benefits applications, which dropped to the lowest
level since the week ended July 10, were projected to fall to
450,000, according to the median forecast of 46 economists in
the Bloomberg survey.  Estimates  ranged from 435,000 to 469,000.  There were no special factors behind the drop in claims, a
Labor Department said as the figures were released. The
government’s seasonal factors anticipated a bigger increase in
unadjusted claims than actually occurred, the official said.  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, dropped to 446,500 last week, the lowest
since Sept. 13, 2008, from 456,500, the report showed.  Continuing Claims  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 86,000 in the week ended Oct. 30 to 4.3 million, in
line with the median projection.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
286,000 to 4.73 million in the week ended Oct. 23.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, dropped to 3.4 percent in
the week ended Oct. 30, from 3.5 percent in the prior week.  Twenty-eight states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 25 reported a decrease. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly employment report
-- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in recent
months as some companies continue to cut staff, while others
expand, pointing to an uneven recovery.  Federal Reserve  A slower pace of economic growth and elevated unemployment
were reasons that prompted Federal Reserve policy makers last
week to announce a second round of large-scale asset purchases.  Job openings fell in September for a second month, a Labor
Department report showed yesterday. It also indicated that
compared with the 14.8 million Americans who were unemployed in
September, there are 5 people vying for every opening, up from
about 1.8 when the recession began in December 2007.  Hiring may get a boost as retailers take on extra workers
for the holiday shopping season that starts this month. Kohl’s
Corp., a department store chain, plans to hire about 40,000
people for the holiday period, 21 percent more than last year.
Toys “R” Us Inc. said it may add about 45,000 employees for
the season, including 10,000 at its temporary stores.  Some companies are still paring workers.  Parker Hannifin
Corp. , a maker of valves and pumps used in factory equipment,
this week said it cut about 170 jobs in its industrial segment
and about 20 in the aerospace unit, and closed some plants in
its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
