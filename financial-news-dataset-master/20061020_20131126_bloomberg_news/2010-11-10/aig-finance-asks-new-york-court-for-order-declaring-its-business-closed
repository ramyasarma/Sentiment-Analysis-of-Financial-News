AIG Finance Holdings Inc., a New
York-based investment company, is seeking a court order
declaring its business closed and notifying creditors and
depositors to present their claims for payment.  AIG Finance Holdings was formed in 1996 to serve as a
holding company for AIG Finance (Hong Kong) Ltd., which was sold
in October 2009, and the company has no remaining operations,
according to a petition filed Nov. 8 in New York state Supreme
Court in Manhattan.  AIG Finance was a subsidiary of a subsidiary and a holding
company for a Hong Kong entity American International Group Inc.
sold off last year, AIG spokesman  Mark Herr  said in an e-mail.
AIG Capital Corp., the company’s sole shareholder, has approved
the dissolution, the petition says.  AIG Finance sent a letter April 30 to New York state’s
 Superintendent of Banks  regarding the company’s proposed
voluntary liquidation, according to the petition. The banking
department responded that it had no objection, the company said.  Attorney  Dan Schulman , who represents the company, did not
immediately return a call for comment.  The case is In the matter of the Voluntary Liquidation and
Dissolution of AIG Finance Holdings Inc., 651940/2010, New York
state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
