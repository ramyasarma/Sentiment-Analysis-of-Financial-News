Hong Kong property transactions
exceeding HK$20 million ($2.6 million) jumped 86 percent in the
seven months to Oct. 31, underscoring that more government curbs
may be needed to cool prices that have surged 50 percent since
early 2009.  There were 3,223 transactions from April 1 to Oct. 31 as
recorded by the Inland Revenue Department, the government said
in an e-mail transcript of an answer to a lawmaker in the city’s
parliament today. Stamp duties collected more than doubled to
HK$6.16 billion from the same period a year ago, it said.  Hong Kong has raised mortgage down payments, increased land
supply, and stopped offering residency to foreigners who buy
properties in the city to dampen prices. Home values have
exceeded the previous peak of 1997, with Chinese buyers
accounting for a third of new purchases in the first half.  “All the government measures are not going to impact
luxury housing much, because they don’t use a lot of leverage,”
said  Nicole Wong , real-estate analyst at CLSA Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Financial Secretary John Tsang in his February budget
raised the stamp duty on sales of more than HK$20 million to
4.25 percent from 3.75 percent from April 1, citing the
increased risk of a property bubble.  The U.S. Federal Reserve’s expansion of stimulus will add
to the risk of a housing bubble in Hong Kong and may force extra
measures to cool prices, said  Norman Chan , the head of the
city’s central bank, on Nov. 4.  Property Stocks Fall  The Hang Seng Property Index, which  tracks  seven developers
in Hong Kong, fell for a second day, dropping 1.5 percent as of
3:33 p.m. local time. The gauge has  gained  15 percent this year,
compared with a 12 percent advance in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index.  Sales of new homes doubled in October on record-low
mortgage rates and an influx of wealthy mainland Chinese buyers.  Hong Kong home prices surged about 50 percent since the
beginning of 2009, according to an  index  compiled by Centaline
Property Agency Ltd., the city’s biggest closely held real-
estate agency.  Home prices more than doubled from a trough in 2003 on a
recovering economy, low interest rates, and an influx of
mainland Chinese buyers whose travel restrictions to the city
have been gradually relaxed. Prior to 2003, home values went
through a slump that began shortly after the Asian financial
crisis hit in 1997.  -- Bonnie Cao . Editors:  Andreea Papuc ,  Linus Chua   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
