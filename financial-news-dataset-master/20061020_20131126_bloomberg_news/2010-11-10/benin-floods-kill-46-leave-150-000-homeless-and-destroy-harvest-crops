A month of heavy rains in  Benin  has
killed 46 people, left 150,000 without homes and affected key
harvests of rice, sorghum and corn, the country’s Interior
Minister said.  The West African nation appealed for $46.9 million in aid
from international donors, Martial Sounton told reporters in the
commercial capital, Cotonou, today.  Almost 400 people have been killed and 1.8 million affected
by floods in Central and West Africa this year, the United
Nations  said  Oct. 26.  Thousands in  Togo , which neighbors Benin, were displaced
last month after the Mono River overflowed its banks. At least
17 people were killed in northern Ghana in September after
Burkina Faso released water from dams into tributaries of the
Volta River, which runs through both nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
