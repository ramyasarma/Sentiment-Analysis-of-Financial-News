Macquarie Group Ltd.’s  South African
securities unit sold 750 million rand ($109 million) of bonds to
fund expansion in Africa’s biggest economy, according to
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. , which helped arrange the sale.  Demand for the bonds, which form part of a 5 billion-rand
domestic-bond program, exceeded supply by 1 1/2 times,
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank, Africa’s largest lender, said
in an e-mailed statement. Rand Merchant Bank, the Johannesburg-
based unit of South Africa’s second-biggest financial services
company,  FirstRand Ltd. , also helped arrange the transaction,
according to the statement.  “It is very nice to bring a new international name into
the South African market,” Standard Bank and Rand Merchant
Bank, said jointly in a separate e-mail to Bloomberg News.
“Investor demand was good.”  The sale comprised 400 million rand of bonds maturing Nov.
9, 2011, that were priced to yield 55 basis points above the
three-month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate, South Africa’s
benchmark money market rate, Standard Bank spokesman Ross
Linstrom said in a telephone interview. The so-called three-
month Jibar rate held steady at a record low 5.865 percent as of
1:05 p.m. local time today.  Macquarie Securities South Africa also sold 350 million
rand of bonds due Feb. 9, 2011, at 25 basis points above the
three-month Jibar rate, Linstrom said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
