Swiss stocks declined for a second
day amid speculation China will raise interest rates to cool the
world’s second-biggest economy.  Syngenta AG  and  Lonza Group AG  lost 2.1 percent and 2.3
percent respectively as economic data suggested industrial
growth was slowing.  Transocean Ltd . shed 2.3 percent, retreating
for the first time this week.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA  rose
4.2 percent after reporting an surge in profit.  The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  of the country’s biggest
stocks slipped 0.2 percent to 6,505.29 at the 5:30 p.m. close of
trading in Zurich, extending its decline this week to 1.3
percent, the biggest drop since August. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also fell 0.2 percent today.  “Chinese inflation concerns are depressing Swiss equities,
but we were expecting a correction anyway after the recent
rally,” said  Thomas Haerter , chief strategist at Swisscanto
Asset Management AG in Zurich. The SMI advanced 4.7 percent
through September and October.  China’s central bank may raise interest rates within weeks
after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in 25 months in
October, a Bloomberg News survey of economists showed.  The SMI swung between gains and losses earlier today as
Irish and 10-year government bonds increased for the first day
in 14 after Group of 20 leaders meeting in Seoul held emergency
talks on the nation’s fiscal crisis.  GDP  Switzerland’s leading industrial companies declined after
the European Union said the economy in the neighboring single
currency zone weakened in the third quarter from the fastest
pace in four years.  Gross domestic product in the 16-nation euro zone rose 0.4
percent from the second quarter, when it increased 1 percent,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists expected a gain of 0.5 percent, the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. Industrial output
fell 0.9 percent in September from the previous month, the
largest drop in 18 months, a separate report showed.  Syngenta, Europe’s biggest maker of chemicals, lost 2.1
percent to 280.20 Swiss francs. Basel, Switzerland-based Lonza,
which operates production sites in China, fell 2.3 percent to
83.15 francs.   Transocean , an offshore oil driller, dropped the most in
more than a week, losing 2.3 percent to 66.45 francs. Crude for
December delivery fell as much as $2.28, or 2.6 percent, to
$85.53 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Richemont  Richemont added 4.2 percent to 53.55 francs. The world’s
largest luxury goods maker reported net income of 646 million
euros ($884 million) in the six months ending Sept. 30, from 344
million euros in the year-earlier period.  “It’s an excellent set of figures, driven by core watch
and jewelry divisions in Americas and Asia-Pacific,” said  Jon Cox , an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. “I would expect a
serious upward move in consensus estimates.”  Julius Baer Group Ltd ., the 120-year-old Swiss private
bank, jumped 2.6 percent to 40.25 francs after saying client
assets increased to 175 billion francs on Oct. 31 from 166
billion francs at the end of June.  Net money inflows “accelerated the momentum” of the first
six months and were “well into” the bank’s target of 4 percent
to 6 percent of assets, Baer said, without giving a figure.  “Baer seems to be on track to reach its growth targets,
but the low client activity and the growth initiatives are a
burden for profitability,”  Tobias Bruetsch , an analyst at Bank
Vontobel AG with a “hold” recommendation on the stock, wrote
to clients.  On its first day listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange luxury
residential developer  Peach Property Group AG  climbed 3.8
percent to 33.20 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
