Copper  imports  by China, the world’s
largest consumer, declined for the second month to the lowest
level in a year, as high international prices and ample domestic
supplies reduced the appeal of buying from overseas.  Shipments of copper and products fell 26 percent to 273,511
metric tons from 368,410 tons in September, the General
Administration of Customs said on its website today.  China’s copper output increased in September, after dipping
in July and August, as high prices and high raw-material
supplies encouraged production. Inventories in Shanghai
warehouses increased 21 percent last month.  “Imports should be lower, as Shanghai and London prices
were not good for arbitrage,” Fan Junmei, an analyst at
Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co., said by phone from Shenzhen.  Copper production gained 3.3 percent from August to 405,000
tons in September, according to the statistics bureau. “Our
survey on utilization rates showed that production might be
slightly higher in October,” Zhu Lin, an analyst at data
provider Shanghai Metals Market, said by phone yesterday.  Copper inventories at Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored
warehouses expanded to the highest level in two months as of
last week, according to the bourse. Imports stored in Shanghai’s
bonded warehouses have at least doubled in the past three
months, Na Liu, Scotia Capital’s China strategy advisor, said in
an e-mail yesterday.  Arbitrage trading by buying the metal in London and selling
in Shanghai has been mostly unprofitable since late July,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Arbitrage traders
try to profit by buying metal in London and selling it in
Shanghai, exploiting a gap in prices.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange declined
1.2 percent at $8,748 at 12:25 p.m. in Shanghai, after reaching
a 28-month high yesterday.  China also imported 310,000 tons of scrap copper, down 24
percent from 410,000 tons in September, data from the Beijing-
based customs showed. Imports of aluminum and the metal’s
products increased 7.5 percent to 70,729 tons from 65,772 tons
in September.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-Smith.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
