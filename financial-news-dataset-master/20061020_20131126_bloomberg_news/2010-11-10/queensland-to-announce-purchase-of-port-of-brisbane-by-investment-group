Andrew Fraser, the treasurer for
the Australian state of Queensland, will meet with members of
the media today at 2:40 p.m. Brisbane time to discuss a
transaction involving the Port of Brisbane.  Queensland will announce the A$2.3 billion sale of the port
to a group led by Macquarie Group Ltd. and Queensland Investment
Corp., the Australian newspaper reported earlier, without saying
where it got the information.  Fraser’s office announced the news conference in an e-
mailed news release.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
