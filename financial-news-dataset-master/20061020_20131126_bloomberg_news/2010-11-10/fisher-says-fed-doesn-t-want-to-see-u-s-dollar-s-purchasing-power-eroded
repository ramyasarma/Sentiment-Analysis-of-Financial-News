Federal Reserve policy makers support
a strong U.S. currency and want to ensure that it doesn’t lose
its purchasing power, said Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher .  “All of us are believers in a strong dollar,” Fisher said
in a Fox Business Network interview today. “We want to make
sure that the dollar has its purchasing power,” and “we want
to make sure it is of great international standing,” he said.  Fisher said yesterday that the central bank’s decision to
undertake a second round of large-scale Treasury purchases may
be the “wrong medicine” for the economy.  The Fed decided last week to buy an additional $600 billion
of Treasuries through June to help boost growth. Including
Treasury purchases from reinvesting proceeds of mortgage
payments, the Fed will buy a total of $850 billion to $900
billion of securities through June.  “We’ll have a better chance of getting it right again if
the people that are elected to Congress and the Senate would get
their act together in terms of incentivizing businesses and
getting fiscal control,” said the 61-year-old regional bank
chief. He votes on the rate-setting Federal Open Market
Committee next year.  Fisher said “we don’t want inflation” and that he’s
concerned about “protectionist impulses out there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
