Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-
biggest mining company, could start a $10 billion share buyback
next year and still sustain record forecast spending on its mine
projects, according to Citigroup Inc.  Such a buyback would be 6 percent earnings per share
accretive, Citigroup analysts led by London-based  Heath Jansen 
said in a report dated yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer  Tom Albanese  has slashed debt that
ballooned after the company’s $38.1 billion takeover of Alcan
Inc. in 2007 and boosted  profits  aided by higher prices for
metals, iron ore and coal. In August, Rio reported first-half
income more than tripled to $5.85 billion.  “We expect Rio to move into a net cash position in 2011,”
the analysts wrote. “This will allow the company to look at
growing through M&A or returning cash to shareholders through
buybacks.”  The company may have net cash of $9.4 billion in 2011,
rising to $23.9 billion in 2012, Citigroup estimated. Rio has
forecast spending on its projects, including expanding its iron
ore operations in Western Australia, of $9 billion next year, 50
percent more than estimated in 2009.  “Our priority is investing in value adding growth,” Rio
Tinto said today in an e-mailed statement. “Additionally we
target a single A credit rating and are committed to resuming
our progressive dividend policy over the longer term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
