A permanent extension of tax cuts
is needed “to reduce the uncertainty in America” that’s
chilling business investment and hiring,  John Boehner , the
presumptive U.S. House speaker, said today.  Asked whether he’s willing to compromise with President
 Barack Obama  on the tax reductions enacted in 2001 and 2003,
the Republican leader said he wants the cuts, which expire at
the end of this year, to be made permanent for all taxpayers.  Congress will take up the issue when it returns next week
for a lame-duck session, following the midterm elections that
put Republicans in charge of the House and reduced the
Democrats’ majority in the Senate. Democrats will retain
control of both houses of Congress until January.  “You can’t invest when you don’t know what the rules are,
when you don’t know what the tax rates are going to be next
year,” the Ohio lawmaker told reporters. “That’s why making
these permanent will be the most important thing we can do to
help create jobs.”  Obama has favored a permanent extension of current tax
rates on earnings up to $200,000 for individuals and up to
$250,000 for households. Since the election gave Republicans a
gain of at least 60 House seats, Obama has signaled a
willingness to compromise with Republicans, who argue that
allowing rates for higher-income Americans to expire would hurt
small businesses that pay taxes as individuals.  Boehner said that “extending all of the current tax rates
and making them permanent will reduce the uncertainty in
America and help small businesses begin to create jobs again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
