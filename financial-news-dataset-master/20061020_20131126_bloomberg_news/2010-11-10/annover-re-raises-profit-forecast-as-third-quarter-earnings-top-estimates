Hannover Re , the world’s third-
biggest reinsurer, raised its full-year earnings forecast after
profit in the third quarter jumped 66 percent, boosted by a one-
time tax gain.  Net income  increased to 271 million euros ($374 million) in
the three months through September, from 163 million euros in
the year-earlier period, the Hanover, Germany-based reinsurer
said in an e-mailed  statement  today. That beat the 252 million-
euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hannover Re, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin ,
raised its 2010 profit target to more than 700 million euros
from about 600 million euros previously. The measure stood at
582 million euros after the first nine months. The company said
on Oct. 20 that third-quarter and full-year earnings would
probably benefit from a gain of 100 million euros following a
court ruling on tax provisions.  The reinsurer aims for net income of about 650 million
euros in 2011, it said in a presentation on its  website  today.
Hannover Re reiterated that it’s targeting a dividend payout
ratio of 35 percent to 40 percent of net income.  “That would translate into a dividend in the range of 2.05
euros to 2.30 euros a share for 2010,” Chief Financial Officer
 Roland Vogel  said on a conference call today.  Hannover Re, which is 50.2 percent owned by German insurer
 Talanx AG , gained 53 cents, or 1.4 percent, to 37.23 euros as of
9:10 a.m. in Frankfurt today. The shares have climbed 14 percent
this year, valuing the company at about 4.5 billion euros.  Investment Income  The reinsurer’s investment income rose to 321 million euros
in the quarter from 281 million euros a year ago. That beat the
264 million-euro average analyst estimate. Hannover Re started
to invest in listed equities again in the third quarter, it
said, adding that the share of equities among its investments
won’t exceed 2.8 percent by the end of the year.  Hannover Re’s biggest claims in the quarter were about 88.5
million euros for an  earthquake  that struck New Zealand in
September and 15.1 million euros for floods in eastern Europe in
August, the company said on its  website .  Reinsurers, which help primary insurers shoulder risks for
clients, are benefitting from a benign June-through-November
U.S. hurricane season, the second in a row. This year’s storm
season, which can generate reinsurers’ most costly claims, has
not resulted in major damages.  Munich Re , the world’s biggest reinsurer, yesterday raised
its 2010 profit forecast after third-quarter earnings increased,
helped by the mild hurricane season and better-than-estimated
investment income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
