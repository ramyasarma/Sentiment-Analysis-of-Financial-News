Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. ’s
Australian franchisee shut 21 of its 51 stores in the country,
taking the total number of such closures to 24, as it attempts
to restructure while in administration.  Krispy Kreme Australia today closed 15 stores in New South
Wales, including two in Sydney’s business district, five in
Victoria and one in Queensland, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. Three stores in the Australian Capital Territory were
closed last week.  Krispy Kreme Australia said that in October it appointed
voluntary administrators, the Australian version of a Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing in the U.S., after directors concluded that
due to a number of underperforming stores the company was at
risk of not meeting its financial obligations.  The store closures resulted in 15 full-time, 142 part-time
and 44 casual jobs being lost, Krispy Kreme said.  Allied Brands Ltd. , the former franchise holders of Baskin-
Robbins ice cream and Cookie Man stores went into voluntary
administration last month, blaming “continued expansion” as
business “struggled in an uncertain economic environment” for
creating a shortage of cash.  Baskin-Robbins canceled its franchise agreement with Allied
Brands last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
