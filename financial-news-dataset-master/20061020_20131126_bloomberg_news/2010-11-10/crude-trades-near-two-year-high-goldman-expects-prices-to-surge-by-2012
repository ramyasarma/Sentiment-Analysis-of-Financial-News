Crude oil fell in New York before a
government report that may show that U.S. stockpiles rose last
week, while the dollar recovered against the euro.  Oil for December delivery fell as much as 62 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $86.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $86.15 at 11:09 a.m. London time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
