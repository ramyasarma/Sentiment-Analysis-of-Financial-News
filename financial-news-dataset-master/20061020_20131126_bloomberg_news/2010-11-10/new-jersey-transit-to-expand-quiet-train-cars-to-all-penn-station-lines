New Jersey Transit , the largest U.S.
statewide public-transit system, plans to add designated quiet
railcars on all peak-time weekday trains by the end of 2011,
Executive Director  James Weinstein  said.  The agency has gotten “overwhelmingly positive” feedback
from commuters on a 90-day pilot program that began Sept. 7,
Weinstein wrote in a report for an agency board meeting in
Newark today. Passengers in quiet cars are asked to refrain from
using mobile phones, talking loudly and operating electronic
devices with sound.  “We hope to add quiet commute systemwide by the end of
next year or sooner,” Weinstein told board members today.  The agency became the largest U.S. transit operation to
offer quiet cars when it began testing the program in the first
and last cars of trains on its Trenton-to-New York line. New
Jersey Transit trains carry about 170,000 commuters to and from
New York City daily, according to its  website .  The quiet service will be added Jan. 3 to the Midtown
Direct, North Jersey Coast and Raritan Valley lines, according
to Weinstein’s report. The agency also will expand the program
on the Northeast Corridor line, adding quiet cars to all peak-
period trains that begin or end at New York Penn Station or
Newark Penn Station.  As in the pilot program, the first and last cars of each
train will be designated for quiet commute, New Jersey Transit
said in a press release.  The program is similar to one used by  Amtrak  on its Acela
and Northeast Regional trains on the East Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
