Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” for a 25th consecutive day in the Central business
district, the city’s Environmental Protection Department said on
its website.  The pollution index had a reading of 116 at the Central
roadside monitoring station, 124 in Causeway Bay and 118 in Mong
Kok as of 6 a.m., the department said.  Readings above 100 at roadside stations trigger a
government warning that people with heart or respiratory
illnesses should avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
