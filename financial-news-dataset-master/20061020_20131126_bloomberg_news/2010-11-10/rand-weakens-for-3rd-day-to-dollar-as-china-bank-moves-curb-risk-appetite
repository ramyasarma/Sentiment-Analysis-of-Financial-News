The rand weakened for a third day
against the dollar on concern that measures by China to cool
asset-price growth will slow the world’s fastest-growing
economy, reducing demand for higher-yielding assets.  The rand depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 6.8956 per
dollar and traded 0.5 percent weaker at 6.8765 by 1:33 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.8445. Against the euro,
the rand added 0.1 percent to 9.4742.  China’s central bank will increase the reserve ratio
requirement for the nation’s banks by 50 basis points from Nov.
16, according to a statement posted to the People’s Bank of
China’s website today. Emerging-market stocks fell the most in
two weeks as analysts bet a report tomorrow will show China’s
inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in two years in
October, putting pressure on policy makers to raise rates.  “There are inflation concerns in China so the market seems
to be expecting them to enter a tightening phase,”  Warrick Butler , a trader at Johannesburg-based  Standard Bank Group Ltd. ,
Africa’s biggest lender, said in a telephone interview from the
city. “Market participants are a bit less inclined to invest in
riskier assets at the moment. Momentum seems to be building for
a bit of a correction in the rand.”  China raised interest rates last month for the first time
in three years and is considering introducing property taxes to
curb the risk of asset-price bubbles, measures that may slow
growth in the world’s second-largest economy. The steps helped
property prices rise at the slowest pace in 10 months in
October, a report today showed.  Government bonds fell in South Africa for a fourth day,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
losing 21 cents to 126.17 rand. The yield on the bond rose more
than 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.019 percent,
the highest level since Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
