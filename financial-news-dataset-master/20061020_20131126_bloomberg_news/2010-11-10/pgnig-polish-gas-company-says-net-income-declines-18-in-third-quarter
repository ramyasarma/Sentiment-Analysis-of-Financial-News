Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , Poland’s dominant gas company, said net income
fell as the weaker zloty and higher oil prices meant gas imports
were less profitable. Analysts called for a steeper drop.  Net income fell to 344.1 million zloty ($121.9 million)
from 417.2 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based
company known as PGNiG said in a regulatory statement today.
That compares with the 184.8 million-zloty mean estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  PGNiG  imports about two-thirds of its gas from Russia,
buying the fuel at a price set in dollars based on a nine-month
average of oil-related products, and selling it at a rate set in
zloty by Poland’s energy regulator.  The increase in oil prices and the weakening of the zloty
caused import costs to climb from a year ago with the company
reporting a 2 percent margin on selling the fuel, compared with
a 12 percent margin a year earlier.  Sales rose 13 percent to 3.88 billion zloty as both
industrial and individual customers bought more gas than a year
earlier. PGNiG sold 10 billion cubic meters of gas in the first
three quarters of 2010, 7.5 percent more than a year ago, when
the economic slowdown cut demand from industrial clients.  In the third quarter, volume gas sales rose 9 percent to
2.4 billion cubic meters.  The company said that the exploration and extraction
segment generated earnings before interest and taxes of 246
million zloty in the period, compared with a loss of 6.7 million
zloty a year earlier, after PGNiG’s revenue from  selling oil 
increased 63 percent to 221 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
