Copper fell the most in two weeks as
imports tumbled to a one-year low in China, the world’s largest
metals consumer.  Inbound  shipments  of copper and products fell 26 percent
from the prior month to 273,511 metric tons in October, the
country’s customs office said today. Price have surged more than
fivefold since the end of 2002 as miners struggled to keep up
with surging demand from China and other emerging economies.  “If Chinese demand starts slow down, there’s going to be a
big ripple effect through the market,” said  Matt Zeman , a
metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.  Copper futures for delivery in December dropped 6.55 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $3.9775 a pound at 11:48 a.m. on the Comex in
New York. A close at that price would mark the biggest loss
since Oct. 27.  Prices touched $4.0475 yesterday, the highest level since
July 2008. The metal jumped 5.8 percent last week, the biggest
advance since the end of July, as the Federal Reserve’s plan to
purchase $600 billion of Treasuries boosted the demand outlook
for commodities.  Copper “had a nice run last week, and is vulnerable to
profit-taking,” Zeman said. “The uptrend is still in place and
I will be surprised to see prices fall below $3.90.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $128, or 1.4 percent, to $8,730 a ton ($3.96 a
pound).  Tin, nickel, aluminum, lead and zinc also fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
