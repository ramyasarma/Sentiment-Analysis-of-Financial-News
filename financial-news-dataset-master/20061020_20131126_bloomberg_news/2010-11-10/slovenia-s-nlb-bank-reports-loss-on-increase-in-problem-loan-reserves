Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest lender, reported a loss of 32.9 million euros
($43.4 million) in the nine-month period as bad loan provisions
continued to climb.  The loss compared with a 50.4 million profit for the same
period a year earlier, the Ljubljana-based bank said in a
statement to the city’s stock exchange today. Reserves to cover
bad loans for the period from July to September amounted to 87
million euros, bringing the total provisions for this year to
205.5 million euros.  Slovenia’s biggest financial-services company will continue
to set aside cash reserves for bad loans into 2011, chief
executive officer  Bozo Jasovic  said in an interview on Nov. 5.
Jasovic expects the pace of increases to slow next year.  Nova Ljubljanska along with its two smaller rivals had its
rating cut by Moody’s Investors Service in September because of
a weak  economy . Slovenia’s gross domestic product dropped the
most among the 16-nation sharing the euro last year. GDP is
forecast to expand an annual 0.9 percent this year and
accelerate to 2.5 percent next year, according to the
government’s economic institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
