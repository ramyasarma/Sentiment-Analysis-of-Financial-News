Former  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp .
Chairman  Joe Moglia  was named president and coach of a new
 United Football League  franchise in Virginia.  Moglia, a former defensive coordinator for Dartmouth
College who has been serving as an adviser for the University of
Nebraska football team, will lead the expansion  Virginia
Destroyers  in 2011.  The Destroyers will be the sixth franchise in the UFL, a
professional league funded by a group of private investors.  Moglia, a Fordham University graduate who began his Wall
Street career with Merrill Lynch & Co. in 1984, helped coach
Dartmouth to Ivy League championships in 1981 and 1982. He
served as chief executive officer of TD Ameritrade, the third-
largest U.S. retail brokerage by client assets, from 2001 to
2008.  Coaching has “been my goal and is where my heart, passion
and skill set lie,” Moglia said in a statement. “I know
football, but what I really know is how to bring together a
team, a program and an organization in a way that enables them
to win. I have done that my entire life. I am ready to do that
on the football field.”  Moglia, 60, has hired former New York Giants linebackers
coach  Tom Olivadotti  as defensive coordinator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
