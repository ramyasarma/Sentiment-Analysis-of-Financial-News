Peru sold $2.5 billion of bonds
denominated in dollars and soles today in the biggest sale of
local currency debt by a Latin American government.  Peru sold $1 billion of 40-year bonds to yield 5.875
percent, and the equivalent of $1.5 billion of bonds denominated
in soles due in 2020 to yield 5.75 percent, the Finance Ministry
said in an e-mail today. The dollar bond’s yield is the lowest
for any regional issue of 30 years or more, the ministry said.  The sale reflects investor confidence in Peru and its sol-
denominated assets, the ministry said. The issue reduces the
government’s debt repayment burden, extends the average life of
public debt and replaces debt in foreign currency with debt
denominated in soles, it said.  Finance Minister  Ismael Benavides  said it was an opportune
moment to tap the international market, ”given the high
liquidity, low global rates and considering the demand for
Peruvian papers.”  Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale,
according to a person familiar with the offering who couldn’t be
identified because he isn’t allowed to speak publicly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
