Level Global Investors LP, the hedge
fund run by  David Ganek  whose offices were raided by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation on Nov. 22, told clients today that the
government said it wasn’t a target of its insider-trading probe.  The firm, with offices in New York and Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in the letter it received a search warrant and
subpoena last week and met with the U.S. Attorney’s Office on
Nov. 23. Investigators confirmed today it wasn’t a target of the
investigation, according to a letter sent to investors.  “Nor, in fact, has the firm been alleged to have engaged
in any misconduct or wrongdoing,” Level Global said in the
letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.  Diamondback Capital Management LLC, a hedge fund whose
offices were also raided on Nov. 22, told clients today that the
government was examining one of its portfolio managers who was
put on leave. The Stamford, Connecticut-based firm said it
received a grand jury subpoena and was told by the government
that it isn’t the target of the probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
