Safaricom Ltd. ,  Kenya’s  biggest
company by market value, will start selling 4.49 billion-
shillings ($55.47 million) of bonds tomorrow, it said.  The sale of the 5-year, fixed- and floating-rate debt will
close on Dec. 14, the company said in a statement in the
Nairobi-based Daily Nation today. The pricing of the bonds will
be announced later, it said.  “The proceeds from each issue of notes will be applied by
 Safaricom Ltd.  for its general corporate capital purposes.”  Safaricom received regulatory approval to sell bonds worth
12 billion shillings on Oct. 5, 2009, and offered a first
tranche of 5 billion shillings. The sale attracted bids of 7.5
billion shillings, all of which the company took up, it said
Nov. 2, 2009.  In the fiscal year through March 2011, Safaricom plans to
spend 23 billion shillings on capital expenditure, Chief
Financial Officer  Chris Tiffin  said Nov. 11.  “Probably expect about the same level next year,” Tiffin
said. “About 20 percent of that will be on the 3G network.”  The company is the only operator of a third-generation
telecommunications network in  Kenya , East Africa’s biggest
economy. In the first half of its fiscal year, Safaricom became
the biggest importer of laptops as it seeks to boost Internet
access. It also bought 400,000 data-enabled handsets, or
smartphones and sold 45,000 data modems, Chief Executive Officer
 Bob Collymore  said on Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
