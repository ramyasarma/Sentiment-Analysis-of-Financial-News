The estate of the late financier
 Lionel Pincus , founder of buyout company Warburg Pincus LLC,
sold his Park Avenue duplex in Manhattan for $12 million, city
property records show.  Pincus lived in the 16-room apartment, encompassing the
24th and 25th floors of 733 Park Ave., for at least 30 years,
according to a court documents filed in 2009. The 7,000-square-
foot (650-square-meter) property was put up for sale in January
for $12.5 million, according to listings website  StreetEasy.com .  “Interior staircase plus elevator landing on each floor,”
reads the  listing  by Joan Kaplan, a broker with the Corcoran
Group Inc. “Encompassing two full floors and 16 rooms, the
apartment features stunning city views north and south up and
down Park Avenue and west towards Central Park.”  City property records filed yesterday named CES Trust as
the buyer of the six-bedroom apartment.  Pincus died in October 2009 at age 78. He had moved from
733 Park Ave. to the Pierre hotel in 2006, according to a
lawsuit filed by his sons in August 2009.  Warburg Pincus  has invested more than $35 billion in 600
companies since inception, including  Inspire Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. and Fidelity National Information Services Inc.  The company traces its roots to E.M. Warburg & Co., an
investment banking and private investment counseling company
founded in 1939 by Eric M. Warburg. In 1966, Warburg was
acquired by Lionel I. Pincus & Co., a venture capital,
investment and consulting firm that Pincus created in 1964.  To contact the reporter on this story:
