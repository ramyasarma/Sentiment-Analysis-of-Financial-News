Zambia’s opposition leader Michael
Sata has been told to go to the office of the Drug Enforcement
Commission, which investigates money laundering.  Investigators, who last week questioned Sata over
allegations surrounding a $100,000 bank transfer, have summoned
him to their offices at 11 a.m. in Lusaka, Sata, leader of the
Patriotic Front, said in a phone interview today. Police fired
tear gas to disperse a crowd of Sata’s supporter when he was
questioned in the capital on Nov. 25.  Edward Mumbi, the former chief executive of Sata’s
Patriotic Front who is now a member of the ruling party, on Nov.  6 accused Sata of paying the money to Catholic priest Frank
Bwalya to encourage him to be critical of the government ahead
of 2008 elections.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
