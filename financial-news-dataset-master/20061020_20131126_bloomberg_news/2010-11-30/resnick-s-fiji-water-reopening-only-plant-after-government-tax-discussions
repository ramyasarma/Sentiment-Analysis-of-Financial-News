Fiji Water LLC, part of billionaire
 Stewart Resnick ’s closely held  Roll International Corp. , is
today reopening its only producing plant in the Pacific Ocean
nation, reversing a decision to shut because of higher taxes.  Fiji Water, the biggest selling premium bottled water in
the U.S. market after  Danone SA ’s Evian brand, will reopen
the bottling plant after a two-day shutdown following
discussions with Fijian officials and after agreeing to “comply
with Fiji’s new water tax law,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement.  The government last week raised the tax applicable to Fiji
Water to 15 cents a liter from one-third of a cent, according to
the national budget speech. That compares with tax of one tenth
of a cent on smaller producers, Fiji Water said.  Prime Minister Commodore  Voreqe Bainimarama , who took power
in a December 2006 bloodless coup, had ordered Fiji Water’s
Director of External Affairs David Roth to leave the country on
Nov. 22 for “interfering in the domestic affairs and governance
of Fiji,” according to a statement on the government’s website.  The company, which said it generates more than F$130
million ($69.3 million) in export revenue annually, employs
almost 400 workers at its plant in Fiji.  To contact the reporter on this story:
