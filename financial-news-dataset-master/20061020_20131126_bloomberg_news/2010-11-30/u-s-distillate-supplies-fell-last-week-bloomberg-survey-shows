U.S. distillate fuel inventories
probably fell for a 10th week as consumption increased, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles  of distillates, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, dropped 1.1 million barrels in the seven days
ended Nov. 26 from 158.3 million, according to the median of 17
analyst  estimates  before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Fifteen of the respondents forecast a decrease and two said
there was a gain.  “Seasonal demand is increasing, which is likely to
engender another distillate draw,” said  Jason Schenker ,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant. “Rising demand shouldn’t be a surprise
because the weather is getting colder.”  Consumption of  distillate fuel  rose 0.6 percent to 3.8
million barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 19, up 3.9 percent
from a year earlier, the department reported on Nov. 24.  Gasoline inventories  probably climbed 300,000 barrels from
209.6 million the prior week. Ten analysts anticipated a gain
and seven forecast a decline.  Stockpiles  of crude oil probably decreased 1.15 million
barrels from 358.6 million the previous week. Sixteen
respondents gave crude-supply estimates. Twelve projected a drop
and four said there was an increase.  Refineries operated  at 85.9 percent of capacity last week,
up 0.4 percentage point from the previous week, according to the
median of analyst responses. U.S. refineries often restart units
in November after conducting maintenance to prepare for the
winter heating season.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
