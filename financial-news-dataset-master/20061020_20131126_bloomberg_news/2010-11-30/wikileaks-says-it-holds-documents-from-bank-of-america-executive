WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange ,
who told Forbes magazine that he’ll release documents from a
U.S. bank next year, said in 2009 that his group had a hard
drive from a  Bank of America Corp.  executive.  “We are sitting on 5GB from Bank of America, one of the
executive’s hard drives,” Assange said in the Oct. 9, 2009,
 interview  with Computerworld magazine, referring to five
gigabytes of data. “To have impact it needs to be easy for
people to dive in and search and get something out of it.”  WikiLeaks plans to release “either tens or hundreds of
thousands of documents depending on how you define it,” Assange
said in a Nov. 11 interview with Forbes, declining to identify
the bank from which the documents came. He said the release
would occur early next year and would include “some flagrant
violations, unethical practices.”  WikiLeaks.org, a nonprofit group that releases information
governments and businesses want to keep confidential, yesterday
began posting on its website what it says are secret,
confidential or in some cases unclassified U.S. embassy cables
written from December 1966 to February 2010.  Five gigabytes can hold about 323,900 pages if saved as
Microsoft Word documents or 500,500 pages of e-mails, according
to conversion  estimates  from Reed Elsevier Plc’s Lexis-Nexis.  Mark Stephens , a London attorney for WikiLeaks, didn’t
respond to a phone message seeking comment.  Scott Silvestri , a
spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
