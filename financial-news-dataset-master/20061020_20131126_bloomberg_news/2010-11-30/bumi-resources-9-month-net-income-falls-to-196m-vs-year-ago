PT Bumi Resources , Indonesia’s
biggest coal producer, posted a 37 percent decline in nine-month
profit from a year earlier as finance costs surged.  Net income fell to $195.6 million, or 1 cent a share, from
$310.6 million, or 1.6 cents a share, the same period a year
earlier, the company said in a statement posted on the Indonesia
Stock Exchange  website  today. Interest expenses and finance
charges increased to $449 million from $80.3 million.  “Year to date September 2010 net income at $195 million is
already higher than full-year 2009,” which was $190 million,
 Dileep Srivastava , Bumi’s corporate secretary, said in an e-mail
today. “This is in spite of higher interest charges.”  Bumi, based in Jakarta, expects  revenue  to increase as much
as 15 percent this year because of an increase in coal’s average
selling price, Srivastava said Nov. 11. Revenue rose to $3.17
billion in the nine-month period from $2.65 billion a year
earlier, Bumi said in the statement filed today.  Sales volume through Sept. 30 this year was 44.9 million
metric tons, compared with 41.2 million tons in the same period
a year earlier, Srivastava said. The average selling price for
coal was $74.30 a ton compared with $57.90 a ton for the same
period a year ago, he said.  “We foresee upcoming upside risk for Bumi Resources early
next year from the coal price settlement to Japan,”  Bagus Hananto , a PT NISP Sekuritas analyst who has a “Buy”
recommendation on Bumi’s stock, wrote in a note today. With the
“spot price hovering above $100 per ton and likely to go higher
amid recent bad weather, this would make the contract price to
Japan more favorable.”  Debt Reduction  Bumi posted $3.2 billion in revenue last year, with a
selling price of $63.1 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Bumi is on track to  cut debt  by $600 million in 2010 and
by another $1 billion in 2011,” Srivastava said. “That is
expected to reduce the interest burden significantly, leading to
an increasingly robust bottom line going forward.”  Bumi’s 2010 net income is forecast at $336.6 million,
according to the  mean estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The company, a unit of  PT Bakrie & Brothers , an investment
holding company controlled by the family of billionaire and
politician  Aburizal Bakrie , may produce and sell 60 million tons
of coal this year, missing an initial target of 64 million tons
due to prolonged heavy rain, Srivastava said Nov. 11. It
produced 60 million tons and sold 58 million tons last year.  A La Nina weather event has brought heavier-than-usual
rainfall to parts of Australia and Asia this year, including
Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The rains hurt tin
and coal production, and have also been blamed by industry
groups in the country for lower palm oil and cocoa output.  Vallar Deal  Bumi  gained 4.7 percent to 2,775 rupiah a share at 10:38
a.m. Jakarta time. The stock has risen 14.4 percent this year,
compared with the 40 percent gain in the benchmark  Jakarta
Composite Index .  Nathaniel Rothschild ’s Vallar Plc agreed earlier this
month to invest $3 billion in two Indonesian coal companies,
including Bumi Resources. After the deal, Vallar will be renamed
Bumi Plc and Bakrie Group will be the largest shareholder.
Bakrie is the first major Indonesian business to tap the  U.K.
equity market , home to mining stocks with a total market value
of more than $250 billion.  The deal would give the  Indonesian miner  the financing it
needs to almost double output by 2013 and make it the world’s
biggest exporter of power station coal,  Indra Bakrie , who will
become chairman of Bumi Plc, said Nov. 18.  A presence in London will allow the company to refinance
its $4.2 billion in debt at lower interest rates, freeing up
cash to invest in expansion, Bakrie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
