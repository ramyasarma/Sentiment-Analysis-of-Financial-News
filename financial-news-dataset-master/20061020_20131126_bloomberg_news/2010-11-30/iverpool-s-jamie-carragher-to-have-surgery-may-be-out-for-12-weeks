Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher
will have surgery on a dislocated shoulder and is likely to be
out of action 12 weeks.  The 32-year-old sustained the injury in the 2-1 defeat at
Tottenham two days ago, a result that left the Reds 10th in
English soccer’s Premier League.  “I’ll be having surgery at the end of the week,”
Carragher told his club’s website. “The average is about 12
weeks. I’d like to come back before that but I’ve got to make
sure it’s right. It will probably be late February or early
March when I’m looking to come back.”                    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
