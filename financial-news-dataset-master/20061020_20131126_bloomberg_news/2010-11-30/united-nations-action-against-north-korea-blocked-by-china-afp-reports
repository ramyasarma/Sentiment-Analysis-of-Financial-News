China is blocking attempts by the UN
Security Council to condemn North Korea over its attack on the
South and its nuclear activities, Agence France-Presse reported
today, citing unnamed diplomats.  “It is unacceptable to ‘condemn’ or even ‘express concern’
over North Korea,” the agency quoted a diplomat as saying.  Security Council contacts on North Korea since its
artillery attack on November 22 were not held yesterday, the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
