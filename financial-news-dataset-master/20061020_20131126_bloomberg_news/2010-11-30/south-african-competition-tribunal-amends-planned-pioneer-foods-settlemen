South Africa’s National Treasury won
a dispute with the country’s Economic Development Ministry to
have a 500 million-rand ($70.4 million) antitrust fine imposed
on  Pioneer Foods Ltd.  paid to the National Revenue Fund.  An agreement brokered by the Economic Development Ministry
that half of the fine should be paid into an agribusiness fund
has been amended, the Competition Tribunal said today.  The government departments will propose the creation of a
fund, to be included in the national budget, that will focus on
promoting agribusiness, they said in a joint statement today.  The Treasury said the payment of fines into any fund except
for the National Revenue Fund was illegal, Johannesburg-based
Business Day reported today, citing legal papers filed by the
Treasury to the Competition Tribunal.  Pioneer, based in Paarl, agreed on Nov. 2 to pay the fine
to settle antitrust cases, including price-fixing in flour and
corn processing, and collusion in flour, bread and corn prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
