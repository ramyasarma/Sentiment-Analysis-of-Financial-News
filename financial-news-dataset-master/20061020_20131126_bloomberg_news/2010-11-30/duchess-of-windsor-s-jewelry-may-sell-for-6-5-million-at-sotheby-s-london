Jewels that King Edward VIII gave
the woman for whom he abdicated sold for 8 million pounds ($12.5
million) in London tonight, almost twice the presale estimate, 
as collectors battled for works by Cartier.  The King of England stepped down in 1936 to become the Duke
of Windsor and marry U.S. divorcee  Wallis Simpson .  Sotheby’s  was
offering 20 pieces that previously belonged to her. The Windsors
were enthusiastic jewelry collectors. They commissioned pieces
from Cartier and other makers during their courtship in the U.K.
and married life in the Bahamas and France.  Eleven Cartier pieces were included in the sale that was
estimated to raise as much as 4.2 million pounds at hammer
prices. Among these was an onyx-and-diamond bracelet designed,
with the Duke’s encouragement, in the form of a panther by
Jeanne Toussaint for Cartier in 1952. This fetched 4.5 million
pounds with fees. It was estimated to sell for between 1 million
pounds and 1.5 million pounds, as was a flamingo-shaped brooch
by Toussaint that the Duchess bought in 1940. The brooch 
fetched 1.7 million pounds with fees.  “The inscriptions tell the story of perhaps the greatest
love story of the 20th century,” said  David Bennett , Chairman
of Sotheby’s Jewelry in Europe and the Middle East.  An unidentified owner was selling the items, which were
acquired at Sotheby’s record “Jewels of the Duchess of
Windsor” sale in Geneva in April 1987, the year after her
death. At that auction, the panther bracelet and flamingo brooch
sold for the equivalent of 860,082 pounds and 497,942 pounds,
said Sotheby’s.  Charm Bracelet  The Duchess’s Cartier diamond charm bracelet today sold for
601,250 pounds against a low estimate of 350,000 pounds. The
piece featured nine gem-set Latin crosses that commemorate
moments of personal significance to the couple, including an
assassination attempt on the King.  An 18-carat gold and gem-set cigarette case by Cartier 
inscribed with the words ``David from Wallis Christmas 1935'' 
and engraved with a map of holiday destinations they enjoyed 
together fetched 181,250 pounds. It was estimated to sell for 
at least 150,000 pounds.   All four lots went to telephone bidders. The flamingo was 
bought by the Collection Cartier and the panther was a record 
for a piece by Cartier, said Sotheby's. The panther was also 
the most expensive bracelet sold at auction.  Sotheby’s  1987 Duchess of Windsor sale in Geneva fetched
75.4 million Swiss francs ($71.7 million), which remains an
auction record for a single-owner collection of jewelry.  Today’s 20-lot sale carried an official low estimate of 2.9
million pounds, based on hammer prices. All the lots sold.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
