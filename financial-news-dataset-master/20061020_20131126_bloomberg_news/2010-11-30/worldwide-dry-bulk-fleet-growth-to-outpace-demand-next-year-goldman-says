The commodity shipping fleet will
expand at a faster pace than demand next year, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts said.  The fleet will swell by 11 percent, exceeding an 8.4
percent increase in demand, Goldman analysts  Scott Malat  and
Varun Gokarn wrote in a report dated Nov. 29. Port delays and
rising shipments up and down the Chinese coast may narrow the
resulting “supply-demand gap,” they wrote.  The estimates were part of new research rating the shares
of Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. and DryShips Inc. as
“neutral.” Diana Shipping Inc. was rated a “buy.” The
analysts gave the overall dry-bulk shipping industry a
“neutral” rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
