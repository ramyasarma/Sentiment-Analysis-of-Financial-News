Business Secretary  Vince Cable  said
the U.K. government won’t “indulge unacceptable bonuses” at
banks and held out the possibility of forcing all listed
companies to disclose the pay of high earners.  “We do need transparency in the U.K., not just for banks
but for high pay in general,” Cable said on BBC Radio 5 today.
“Disclosure is important. That’s the way in which shareholders
keep track of the companies in which they’re investors.”  Cable denied he was in disagreement with Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne , who is trying to persuade European
Union countries to join the U.K. in forcing more disclosure.  Morgan Stanley senior adviser  David Walker  last year told
the U.K. government that banks should disclose the number of
individuals who earn more than 1 million pounds ($1.6 million).
Osborne’s decision to seek international agreement reduces the
likelihood such a move will take place.  “It’s better to do it internationally,” Cable said. He
raised the possibility of unilateral U.K. action. He has already
begun a review into helping shareholders control the activities
of businesses they own, listing takeovers and salaries as two
areas of concern.  To contact the reporter on this story:
