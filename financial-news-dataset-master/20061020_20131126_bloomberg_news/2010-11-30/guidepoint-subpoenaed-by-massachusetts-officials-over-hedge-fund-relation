Guidepoint Global LLC, a research
firm that links investors with experts, was subpoenaed by
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth  William F. Galvin  in
connection with its relationship to a hedge fund in the state.  “The recent pronouncement about the role of expert
consultants and hedge funds is extremely troubling,” Galvin
said in an e-mailed statement today. “It is the responsibility
of my office as sole regulator of small state-registered hedge
funds to fully explore and investigate the role these firms play
with these state registered entities.”  Mark Semer , a spokesman for New York-based Guidepoint,
declined to comment.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed this week that
the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation
related to illegal trading on Wall Street. Don Ching Trang Chu,
an employee of expert-network firm Primary Global Research LLC
in Mountain View, California, was arrested on Nov. 24 for
allegedly providing insider information to hedge funds. He was
charged in a criminal complaint filed by U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara’s office in Manhattan.  Hedge funds including Diamondback Capital Management LLC
and SAC Capital Advisors have received government subpoenas
related to the probe. None has been accused of wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
