U.K. stocks retreated for a third
day to a 10-week low as banks and insurers fell amid continuing
concern that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is worsening.  Barclays Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Resolution Plc tumbled more than 2 percent as credit-default
swaps on European bank bonds surged to the highest level since
April 2009.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  dropped 0.4 percent to
5,528.27 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has fallen
2.6 percent in November, the biggest monthly drop since June.
The broader  FTSE All-Share Index  lost 0.5 percent today while
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  slid 0.4 percent.  “Investors remain in the clutches of edgy sentiment with
concerns over Europe remaining at the fore,” said  Giles Watts ,
head of equities at City Index in London. “Providing substance
to the fears is the continued pressure on the euro.”  The euro fell to 10-week lows versus the dollar and the yen
today as investors shunned riskier assets. The FTSE 100 has
dropped 2.5 percent over the past two days after a bailout of
Ireland at the weekend failed to reassure investors that the
debt crisis will be contained.  Barclays, the U.K.’s third-biggest lender, dropped 2.6
percent to 256.15 pence and RBS retreated 2.4 percent to 37.59
pence, sending a  gauge  of banks to the lowest level since July.  Resolution, Standard Life  Resolution, an insurance buyout firm, fell 3.8 percent to
211.3 pence, while Standard Life Plc, Scotland’s second-biggest
insurer, lost 3.7 percent to 201.2 pence.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on junior debt
of banks and insurers soared as much as 25.5 basis points to
320, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Swaps on Italy, Spain,
Portugal and Ireland jumped to records, driving Europe’s
benchmark index of government debt risk to an all-time high.  The following stocks also rose or fell in the U.K. and or
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Essar Energy Plc  (ESSR LN) gained 4.1 percent to 522 pence,
the best performer in the FTSE 100. The Indian power generator
and refiner will join the MSCI United Kingdom Index after the
close of trading today. Joining an index can boost a company’s
stock price because funds that mirror it buy shares of the
members.  Findel Plc  (FDL LN) jumped 6.5 percent to 12.25 pence after
the U.K. home-shopping and educational-supplies company said
talks aimed at refinancing the balance sheet were at an
“advanced stage.”  Holidaybreak Plc  (HBR LN) rallied 7.4 percent to 290 pence
after the travel company said full-year profit soared to 20.2
million pounds ($31.4 million) as more customers took
educational and adventure trips.  Halma Plc  (HLMA LN) slid 4.7 percent to 313.6 pence. Numis
Securities lowered its recommendation for the shares to “hold”
from “add” after the world’s second-biggest maker of smoke
detectors reported first-half results.  RPC Group Plc  (RPC LN) jumped 3 percent to 288.25 pence
after the U.K. maker of plastic containers said first-half net
income rose 64 percent to 13.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
