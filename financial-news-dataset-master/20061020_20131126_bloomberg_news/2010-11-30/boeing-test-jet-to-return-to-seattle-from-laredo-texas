A Boeing Co.  Dreamliner  test jet
damaged in an in-flight fire on Nov. 9 is returning to Seattle
today from Laredo, Texas.  The 787 took off at 2 p.m. Central Standard Time and is
expected to arrive about four hours later, according to the
FlightAware.com  website  that tracks the aircraft. Technicians
replaced a power panel and burned insulation, and made repairs
to the internal structure,  Lori Gunter , a Boeing spokeswoman,
said today in a telephone interview.  The plane made an emergency landing in Laredo after a fire
knocked out some of the systems during a test flight. The
incident led Boeing to halt flights of all six test aircraft.
Last week, the Chicago-based company said it will revise the
Dreamliner’s program schedule as it alters some software and
power-distribution panels.  Today’s flight is being staffed by two pilots and four crew
members. The plane will land at Boeing Field, the flight-test
home base for the fleet, where four other test planes sit. The
sixth plane is in Everett, Washington, undergoing scheduled
maintenance, Gunter said.  Boeing fell 59 cents to $63.77 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 18 percent
this year.  The company has said the fire in its 787 was likely caused
by “foreign debris” that led to a short circuit or electrical
arc. A stray aluminum washer shorted out a power panel, causing
the blaze during the Nov. 9 flight, said three people familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be identified because Boeing
hasn’t confirmed the details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
