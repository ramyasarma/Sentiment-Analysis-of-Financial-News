The yield difference between two-
year and 10-year Treasury notes may narrow as the Federal
Reserve buys securities this week as part of its asset-purchase
program, according to BNP Paribas SA.  “This week, there are four remaining Fed buybacks, two
today, no coupon auctions and month-end extension buying
flows,” analysts at the bank, including Cyril Beuzit  in London,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “All of these factors should
be supportive of Treasuries, and the 2s-10s curve should flatten
in such a scenario.”  The yield difference betwen the two- and 10-year notes was
229 basis points as of 8:52 a.m. in London. That’s the least
since Nov. 12, according to Bloomberg generic data. The 10-year
note yield was at 2.79 percent, with the two-year note yield at
0.5 percent.  “We stay bullish on Treasuries, with our year-end forecast
being 2.60 percent for the 10-year note,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
