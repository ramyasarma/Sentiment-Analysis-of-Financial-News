JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, hired former  Merrill Lynch  & Co.
wealth-management executive  Michael Falcon  to head its
retirement-services division in the U.S. and Canada.  Falcon will report to  George Gatch , chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Investment Management Americas, the New York-based
bank said today in a statement. He is currently president of
Samuel Bennett Inc., a financial and media consulting service
founded by  Jean Chatzky , the financial editor for NBC’s Today
show.  Falcon, who was at Merrill Lynch from 2000 to 2008, is
returning to the bank that gave him one of his first jobs after
graduating from Indiana University Bloomington in 1984,
according to his  biography on LinkedIn . He has been in the
finance industry since 1985 when he joined Chase Manhattan Bank,
which became part of JPMorgan through several acquisitions.  “Bringing on someone with Michael’s experience will ensure
that we expand our retirement offering to be even more
comprehensive, addressing new market realities and the current
needs of Americans who are saving for retirement,” Gatch said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
