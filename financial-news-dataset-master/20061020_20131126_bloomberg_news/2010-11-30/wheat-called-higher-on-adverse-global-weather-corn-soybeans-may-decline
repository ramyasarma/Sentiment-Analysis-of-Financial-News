What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on concern that adverse weather
will reduce global production and crop quality, boosting demand
for U.S. supplies, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on concern that burgeoning European debt will erode
demand for commodities, Gerlach said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the CBOT amid speculation that the European Union may
have to bail out more members, damping the global economy and
demand for raw materials, including grain, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
