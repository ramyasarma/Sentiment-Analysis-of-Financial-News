Almost one in five drivers in the
U.S. who died in car crashes tested positive for drugs,
according to the U.S. highway-safety regulator.  Of drivers tested after dying in car crashes last year, 18
percent had drugs in their bodies, up from 13 percent in 2005,
the Washington-based National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said in a statement today. Sixty-three percent of
the 21,798 drivers who died in accidents in 2009 were tested.  “Today’s report provides a warning signal that too many
Americans are driving after having taken drugs, not realizing
the potential for putting themselves and others on the highway
at risk,” NHTSA Administrator  David Strickland  said in the
statement. The study is the agency’s first analysis of drugged-
driving deaths.  The study, which included illicit and some prescription
drugs, looked at crashes from 2005 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
