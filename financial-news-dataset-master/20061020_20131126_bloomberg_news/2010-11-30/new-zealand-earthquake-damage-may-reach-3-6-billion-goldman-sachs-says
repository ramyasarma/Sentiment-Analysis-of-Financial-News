Damage from New Zealand’s worst
earthquake in eight decades may total as much as NZ$4.9 billion
($3.6 billion) and take four years to repair, according to a
Goldman Sachs report.  The damage estimate is higher than the  Treasury
Department ’s provisional NZ$4 billion forecast because of
aftershocks since the initial 7 magnitude temblor rocked
Canterbury province on Sept. 4,  Philip Borkin , an economist at
Goldman Sachs & Partners New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland, said in
the e-mailed report.  More than 138,000 damage claims have been lodged with the
Earthquake Commission, the government-owned insurer responsible
for repairs, ahead of a Dec. 4 deadline. About 3,300 properties
are on land that needs to be stabilized, and in some cases
protection such as underground retaining walls will be required
before rebuilding can start, the  government  said today.  “For the majority of property owners, the recovery process
is relatively straightforward and the repair process can start
now,” as long as the commission has assessed their case,
Earthquake Recovery Minister  Gerry Brownlee  said in an e-mailed
statement.  For a further 5,500 properties, land damage can be fixed
while the building repair is carried out, according to the
government report, which mapped about 22,500 sites overall.  Boost to Economy  Rebuilding homes, office buildings and pipelines will boost
New Zealand’s  economy  over the next two years, adding 0.8
percentage point to growth by the third quarter of 2011, when
reconstruction is expected to be at a peak, Borkin said. By the
end of 2012, gross domestic product will still be 0.4 point
higher than in the absence of the earthquake, he said.  Homebuilding and repair is expected to surge 5.1 percent in
the year ending June 30, 2011, from a year earlier as the
increase in Canterbury rebuilding offsets depressed activity
elsewhere, Borkin said. Excluding the earthquake effects,
residential construction is forecast to increase 2.1 percent.  Goldman Sachs assumes building and contents damage to about
145,000 homes will cost NZ$2.5 billion. It said the cost to
20,000 non-residential buildings will be NZ$1.4 billion and
added an estimated NZ$1 billion for infrastructure repairs.  Infrastructure repair is expected to be completed by mid-
2012 and the reconstruction of houses may take until 2014,
Borkin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
