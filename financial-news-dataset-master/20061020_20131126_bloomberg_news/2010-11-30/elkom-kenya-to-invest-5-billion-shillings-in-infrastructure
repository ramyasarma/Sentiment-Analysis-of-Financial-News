Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of  France
Telecom SA , plans to spend as much as 5 billion shillings ($62
million) next year expanding its network in the East African
nation, Chief Executive Officer  Mickael Ghossein  said.  The company, based in Nairobi, will increase mobile-phone
base stations to 1,100 by the third quarter of 2011, compared
with 650 now, Ghossein said in an interview today.  “This year we are investing 4 billion shillings,” he
said. “Orange will have one of the best coverage” areas in the
country. Orange is the mobile-phone unit of France Telecom.  The French operator has invested almost 200 million euros
($260 million) since 2008 when it began operations in Kenya, the
Nairobi-based unit said in April.  Telkom Kenya has a 22 percent shareholding in The East
African Marine System, a fiber-optic Internet cable also known
as Teams, and 8 percent of the East African Submarine System,
known as Eassy. The company has as many as 80,000 customers
using its broadband Internet service and another 1 million
accessing the Internet through mobile phones, he said.  Telkom Kenya, which is 49 percent state-owned and 51
percent held by France Telecom, will own 10 percent of a fiber-
optic link known as Lower Indian Ocean Network 2, or Lion 2,
that will be built by the French operator, Ghossein said. The
link will be completed in June 2012, the company said in
October.  “Today, Kenya has 7 terabytes per second of capacity. In
the future Kenya will have around 11 terabytes per second
capacity. That means Kenya will have enough capacity to feed”
other countries, Ghossein said.  Telkom Kenya is presently leasing fiber-optic capacity to
Uganda and will sell additional bandwidth to Tanzania, Ethiopia
and Somalia when it becomes available, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
