South Africa’s National Treasury
held talks with the Department of Economic Development late
yesterday in an attempt to resolve a dispute over where the cash
fine imposed on  Pioneer Foods Ltd.  should be paid.  “There were still talks last night that might sort it out
before the hearing resumes today,” Jabulani Sikhakhane, a
spokesman for the National Treasury, said in a phone interview
in Johannesburg today.  The treasury is demanding that the 855 million rand ($120
million) penalty for anti-competitive behavior should be paid
into the National Revenue Fund, while the  Department of Economic
Development  has brokered an agreement allowing Pioneer to pay
250 million rand of the fine into an agribusiness fund instead.  The hearings at the Pretoria-based Competition Tribunal,
which issued the fine against Paarl-based Pioneer, are due to
continue later today, Lerato Motaung, the registrar at the
Competition Tribunal said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
