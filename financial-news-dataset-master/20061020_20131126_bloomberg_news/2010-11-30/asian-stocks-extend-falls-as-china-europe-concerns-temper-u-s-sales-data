Asia stocks fell, erasing the
regional benchmark’s gain for the month, amid concerns about
possible interest rate increases in China and the spread of
Europe’s debt crisis to countries beyond Greece and Ireland.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.7 percent to 128.74 at
12:42 p.m. in Tokyo, with declines deepening after Japanese
markets reopened from lunch. More than two stocks fell for each
that rose.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
