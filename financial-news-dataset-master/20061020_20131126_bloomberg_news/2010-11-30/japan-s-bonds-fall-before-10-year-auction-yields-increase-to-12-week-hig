Japan’s 10-year bonds fell,
completing their biggest monthly loss since April 2008, on
speculation investors cut their holdings to prepare for an
auction of benchmark securities tomorrow.  Ten-year yields climbed to the highest level in 12 weeks
before a U.S. report tomorrow that economists said will show
employers added jobs for a second month. Today’s decline in debt
may prompt the government to increase the coupon at tomorrow’s
2.2 trillion yen ($26 billion) auction from 1 percent at the
previous sale.  “Investors find it hard to make big moves before
tomorrow’s 10-year sale, and that’s limiting upward momentum”
for bonds, said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at
Okasan Securities Co. “The current yield level suggests the
coupon for the securities will be 1.2 percent.”  The yield on the 1 percent note due September 2020 climbed
1.5 basis points to 1.19 percent as of 3:10 p.m. in Tokyo at
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price fell 0.130 yen to 98.332 yen. The yield
earlier increased to 1.195 percent, the highest since Sept. 6.
Ten-year yields have risen 27 basis points this month.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.02 to
140.87 at the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
contracts fell to 140.41 yesterday, the lowest since June 17.  Debt Sale  The previous 10-year sale on Nov. 2 drew bids for 3.91
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.85 at the October offering.  Primary dealers, companies that are required to bid at
government debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds before an
auction in case prices decline before they can pass on the new
securities to investors.  U.S. companies added 72,000 jobs this month after hiring
43,000 workers in October, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before the report from ADP Employer Services tomorrow.  The decline in debt was tempered as Japanese reports today
showed industrial production dropped for a fifth month and the
unemployment rate increased.  Factory output fell 1.8 percent in October, after dropping
1.6 percent in the prior month, the Trade Ministry said. The
jobless rate climbed to 5.1 percent last month from 5 percent in
September, a statistics bureau report showed.  The production data “confirmed a rapid slowdown in the
economy toward year-end, which is not a sell factor for bonds,”
said  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates strategist in Tokyo at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain’s biggest government-owned
bank. “As Europe’s contagion risks get bigger, that could
prompt flight to quality. JGBs may be supported given their
yields are at an attractive level.”  Five-year yields fell 1.5 basis points to 0.445 percent
after rising to 0.47 percent yesterday, the  highest  since May 12.  -- With assistance from Yumi Ikeda in Tokyo. Editors:  Nicholas Reynolds , Nate Hosoda   To contact the reporter on this story:
