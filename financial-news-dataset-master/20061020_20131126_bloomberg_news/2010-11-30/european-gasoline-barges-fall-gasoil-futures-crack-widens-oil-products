European  gasoline  barges gained as
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA bought lots. Prices for
Eurobob grade advanced 6.8 percent this month.  Gasoil’s crack, or premium to Brent, shrank. Total also
bought a barge of jet fuel.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $782 and $783 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. Later in the day, trades
took place from $785 to $787 a ton during a Platts trading
window. That compares with deals yesterday from $770 to $788.  Shell bought 2,000 tons of the 5,000 tons that changed
hands in the morning. Gunvor International Ltd. was the main
seller. Total was the main buyer of the 6,000 tons that traded
in the afternoon. The transactions are for Eurobob grade, to
which ethanol is added to make the finished automotive fuel.  Gasoline’s crack  narrowed to $5.95 a barrel from $6.40
yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker in London.  Naphtha’s crack fell to $3 a barrel from $3.30 yesterday,
PVM data shows. Naphtha is used in gasoline and petrochemical
production.  Middle Distillates  Total purchased 2,000 tons of jet fuel from Air France-KLM
at a premium of $59 a ton to December ICE gasoil, priced for
loading from Dec. 6 to Dec. 10 in the ARA-area, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts window which
ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in London. That’s in line with
yesterday’s trade.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $8 to $9 a ton
relative to December ICE gasoil, the survey showed. That’s
cheaper than Nov. 26 trades at premiums of $5.50 to $6.50.  Gasoil for December delivery decreased 0.8 percent to
$728.75 a ton as of 5:03 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The January contract shed 0.6 percent to
$734.50, according to the exchange.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, narrowed for
a third day to $11.73 a barrel from $11.89 yesterday, according
to data on ICE. Brent crude for January declined 0.7 percent to
$86.77 a barrel on ICE.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded twice at a $21 a ton
premium to December ICE gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That’s
in line with trades on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
