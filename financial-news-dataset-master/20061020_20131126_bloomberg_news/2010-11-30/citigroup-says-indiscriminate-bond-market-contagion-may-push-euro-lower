The euro may face renewed selling
pressure as political efforts to control Europe’s debt crisis
fail to stem increasing bond yields, including those for Belgian
and French debt, Citigroup Inc. said.  “Euro-area contagion is becoming fairly indiscriminate,”
 Valentin Marinov , a currency strategist in London, wrote in an
investor report today. “There is so far little indication that
euro-area politicians will act quickly and forcefully enough to
prevent further spread widening. We cannot exclude more euro
selling.”  The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3108 as of 6:48 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
