Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the U.K.’s 3.25 billion-pound ($5.1 billion)
bilateral loan to Ireland didn’t mean he would be willing to
offer the same support to other European countries in trouble.  “I’ve said that Ireland is a very special case,” Osborne
told CNBC television in an interview in London yesterday, citing
Britain’s economic ties with the only country with which it
shares a land border. “It’s certainly not a blank check for
other countries.”  Osborne said the U.K. hadn’t offered a bilateral loan to
Greece earlier this year. He refused to be drawn on possible
bailouts for Portugal or Spain, saying Britain would still be
prepared to offer support through the International Monetary
Fund.  European leaders are struggling to contain a worsening
sovereign debt crisis that forced Ireland last week to follow
Greece and ask for an international bailout. While European
Union governments agreed on Nov. 28 to give Ireland an 85
billion-euro ($110 billion) rescue package,  Spanish  and Italian
bonds then dropped on concern they may also need help as they
try to get budgets under control.  The chancellor denied that a banking crisis in Ireland
would have led to a secondary crisis in Britain. “There’s no
indication that I’ve received that that’s the case,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
