Irish  consumer confidence  stayed
close to its lowest level in 17 months this month as the country
was forced to seek financial aid and the nation braced itself
for higher taxes and spending cuts.  The consumer sentiment index rose to 48.4 from 48.1 in
October, KBC Ireland and the  Economic & Social Research
Institute  in Dublin said in an e-mailed statement today. The
October reading was the lowest since May 2009.  Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  will detail a plan next week
to save 6 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in 2011, part of an
effort to narrow the biggest fiscal deficit in the euro area.
The cost of bailing out the country’s lenders, including  Anglo
Irish Bank Corp ., forced the state to agree on Nov. 28 an 85
billion-euro international aid package.  “Even if Irish consumers remain very gloomy, confidence is
not completely in freefall,”  Austin Hughes , chief economist at
KBC Ireland, said in the statement. While “the prospects for
household finances is likely to be very difficult, it may not be
quite as awful as had been feared.”  KBC’s gauge of how consumers viewed their current situation
slipped to 76.6 in November from 76.7 the previous month. A
measure of households’ expectations rose to 29.4 from 28.8.  Lenihan will lay out the 2011 budget on Dec. 7, the first
step in a four-year plan to narrow the deficit to the European
Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 from
about 12 percent this year. Irish 10-year bonds fell today,
widening the  yield spread  against German bunds, Europe’s
benchmark, by 15 basis points to a record 664 basis points.  “The December and January results should tell us whether
this month represents a possible turning point or is merely a
statistical aberration,” said Hughes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
