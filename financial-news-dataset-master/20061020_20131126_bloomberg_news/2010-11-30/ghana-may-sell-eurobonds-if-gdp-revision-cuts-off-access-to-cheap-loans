Ghana may sell more Eurobonds should
the West African nation’s new middle income status cut off
access to concessionary borrowing, Deputy Minister of Finance
and Economic Planning Seth Terkper said.  “We may turn to the international capital market,”
Terkper told a conference in the capital, Accra, today. “We
will widen the tax net but if taxes and concessionary loans do
not meet requirements in the mean time, then we may have to turn
to the market.”  The Ghana Statistical Service said on Nov. 5 that the
economy is 75 percent bigger than previously calculated, raising
per-capita income to $1,318, above the $976 threshold to be
defined as a middle-income nation. That may reduce cheap loans
from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.  Ghana’s 8.5 percent fixed-rate Eurobond due October 2017
yielded 6.13 percent as of 1:22 p.m., up from 6.01 percent
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. Ghana sold $750 million
of 10-year Eurobonds paying interest of 8.5 percent in 2008.  The 2011 budget approved this month raised estimated tax
revenue to 24.8 percent of GDP next year from 23.5 percent in
2010. The revision to GDP means the tax ratio was probably
closer to 16 percent this year, Alan Cameron, sub-Saharan Africa
analyst at Business Monitor International, said on Nov. 15.  Among some of the measures announced in the budget were the
introduction of taxes in the aviation industry, increases in
import tariffs and a reduction in tax exemptions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
