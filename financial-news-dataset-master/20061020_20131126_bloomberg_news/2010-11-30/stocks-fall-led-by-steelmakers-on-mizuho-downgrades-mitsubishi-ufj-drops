Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
plunged the most in seven weeks on concern China will act
further to slow inflation and as steelmakers and banks dropped
after analysts cut investment ratings.  TDK Corp., an electronics maker that gets more than 30
percent of its sales from China, dropped 3.6 percent.  Nippon
Steel Corp.  and JFE Holdings Inc., Japan’s top-two steelmakers,
fell at least 2.6 percent after Mizuho Securities Co. lowered
its recommendations on the shares. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., the country’s largest bank by market value, slumped
2.2 percent following a rating cut at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “Worries that China will raise the interest rate are
increasing,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager at
investment strategy department at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“People are worried growth in China would slow down if the
country tightens its policies.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.9 percent to 9,937.04 at 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, the most since Oct. 12 and the first close below 10,000
since Nov. 17. The broader  Topix  index lost 1.6 percent to
860.94, with six times as many stocks retreating as advancing.
All but one of the Topix’s 33 industry groups dropped.  The Nikkei decreased the most among major equity gauges in
the Asia-Pacific region. Declines accelerated this afternoon
after a plunge by the  Shanghai Composite Index  in China, Japan’s
biggest export destination, and as the euro weakened against the
yen, cutting the outlook for earnings from business in Europe.  Japan’s industrial production fell and the unemployment
rate unexpectedly climbed in October, the government and the
statistics office said today, providing early signs that the
country’s economy will likely shrink this quarter.  Best Performer  The Nikkei 225 rose at the fastest pace among gauges for
the world’s 40 largest equity markets this month to yesterday,
when it climbed to its highest close since June. The 8 percent
gain for all of November was the gauge’s biggest monthly advance
since March.  This year, the Nikkei has fallen 5.8 percent, compared with
increases of 6.5 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 3.3 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 17.4 times estimated
 earnings  on average, versus 14 times for the S&P 500 and 11.6
times for the Stoxx 600.  TDK, the world’s largest maker of magnetic heads for disk
drives, tumbled 3.6 percent to 5,390 yen. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co., which is the world’s biggest maker of giant
excavators and gets more than one-fourth of its  sales in China ,
sank 3.1 percent to 1,908 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of earth
movers that gets about 20 percent of its sales in China,
retreated 2.4 percent to 2,318 yen.  Inflation in China  China needs to raise interest rates by another 200 basis
points to curb inflation, given existing excess liquidity, Zhong
Jiyin, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
wrote in a commentary in the China Daily today.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, a gauge of
manufacturing, is scheduled to be released tomorrow.  The yen appreciated to 109.99 against the euro today, the
highest level since Sept. 15. A stronger yen reduces the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency.  Steelmakers  declined the most  among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups today. Nippon Steel tumbled 4.5 percent to 277 yen, the
most since October 2009. JFE Holdings lost 2.6 percent to 2,661
yen. The companies were cut to “neutral” from “outperform”
at Mizuho Securities, which said profit will miss forecasts in
the fiscal year ending March. Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd.,
which was reduced to “underperform” from “neutral,” slid 3.3
percent to 203 yen.  Steelmakers Tumble  The Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information, that Japanese steelmakers may have to increase
spending on raw materials by more than 50 billion yen ($590
million) for the January-to-March period from the current
quarter because of rising prices of iron ore and coking coal.  Nintendo Co., the world’s biggest maker of portable video-
game machines, was the  biggest support  for the Topix. The stock
jumped 3.4 percent to 22,730 yen, the most since Aug. 18.
Nintendo said it sold more Wii game consoles in the U.S. in the
week including “Black Friday,” the Friday following the
Thanksgiving holiday, so named because that’s when many U.S.
retailers become profitable.  Rating cuts at Credit Suisse dragged down a group of  banks 
in the Topix by the most since Oct. 15.  Shinichi Ina , an analyst
at the brokerage, lowered his recommendations on Mitsubishi UFJ,
Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. and
Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. to “neutral” from
“outperform.”  Mitsubishi UFJ  slid 2.2 percent to 396 yen. Mizuho fell 1.5
percent to 133 yen. Sumitomo Trust retreated 2.8 percent to 444
yen. Chuo Mitsui dropped 2.3 percent to 295 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
