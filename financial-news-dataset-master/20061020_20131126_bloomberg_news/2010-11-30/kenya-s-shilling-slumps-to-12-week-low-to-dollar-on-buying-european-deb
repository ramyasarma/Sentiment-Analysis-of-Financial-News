Kenya’s shilling depreciated to the
lowest in 12 weeks versus the dollar as businesses purchased
dollars to pay for goods and as concern Europe’s debt crisis
will worsen curbed demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened for
a fourth day, decreasing as much as 1.2 percent to 81.88, the
lowest since Sept. 9, before trading 0.1 percent down at 81 by
3:02 p.m. in Nairobi from a close of 80.95 yesterday.  “Businesses in energy, telecommunications and
manufacturing are busy in the forex market as they purchase
dollars to pay off invoices and the weakening of the euro has
also affected the shilling,”  Joel Mbuvi , head of treasury at
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview from Nairobi.  The euro dropped below $1.30 for the first time in more
than 10 weeks today on concern Spain, Italy and Portugal may
require a bailout following Ireland’s 85 billion-euro ($111
billion) package.  The shilling is expected to trade within the 80.80-81.30
range as inflows from tourism and agricultural exports are
expected to offset year-end dollar demand, Mbuvi said.  Tea production by the world’s largest producer of the black
variety of the leaves increased 5.3 percent in the 12 months
through September compared with a year earlier, the Central Bank
of Kenya said in an e-mailed statement today.  “In value terms, tea was 44 percent up due to improved
prices,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
