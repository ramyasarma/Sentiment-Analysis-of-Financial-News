New York  Governor-elect  Andrew Cuomo 
today accused Democratic Assembly members of widening the state
deficit by failing to act to close this fiscal year’s spending
gap.  “For them to come back and do nothing is very
distressing,” Cuomo told reporters in Albany after meeting
Assembly Democrats. They made “a bad situation worse” because
failing to close this year’s gap makes next year’s $9 billion
deficit larger, he said.  Cuomo, 52, a Democrat, won the seat Nov. 2 with 61 percent
of the vote. He met the lawmakers in an Albany hotel one day
after they declined to vote on a bill to cut state spending to
close a $315 million gap in the state’s $135.3 billion  budget .  New York, the third most-populous U.S. state, faces a $9
billion to $10 billion deficit in the fiscal year beginning
April 1, 2011, according to Budget Director  Robert Megna .  To contact the reporter on this story:
