Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said today that the economy is “not growing fast
enough to materially reduce the unemployment rate” and the rate
is “about the same as it was when the recession officially
ended.”   The share of unemployed who are jobless for more than six
months is greater than 40 percent, Bernanke said at an event in
Ohio.  “This is very unusual and very worrisome because people
who are out of work for an extended period, their skills tend to
erode,” Bernanke said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
