Pakistan’s military chief, General
 Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , told the U.S. ambassador in March 2009
he’d be prepared to force out President  Asif Ali Zardari  to
safeguard political stability, according to a diplomatic cable
provided to the  Guardian newspaper  by Wikileaks.org.  Kayani said he would stop short of a coup and keep the
government led by Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani  in
place, according to the cable, which said he made the comment
during a fourth meeting with the ambassador in a week. He
mentioned  Asfandyar Wali Khan , leader of the Awami National
League Party, as a possible replacement for Zardari, it said.  The meeting occurred amid a stand-off between Zardari and
opposition leader  Nawaz Sharif  over the reinstatement of judges
fired under military rule in 2007. Six days after the meeting,
Zardari agreed to reinstate Pakistan’s chief justice, who had
been the focal point of sometimes violent street protests.  Gilani’s government extended Kayani’s term for an
additional three years in July to help in the fight against
Taliban factions close to the border with Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
