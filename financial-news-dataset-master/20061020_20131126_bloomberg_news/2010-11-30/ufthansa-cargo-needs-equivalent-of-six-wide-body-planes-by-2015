Deutsche Lufthansa AG ’s cargo unit
said it needs extra aircraft equivalent to six Boeing Co. MD-11
wide-bodies by 2015 to match growth in the air-freight market.  The division, which ranks as the world’s fifth-largest
cargo carrier, forecasts a 5 percent annual gain in its freight
traffic from 2012 to 2015, driven by Asian demand,  Andreas Otto ,
the unit’s sales chief, said in a presentation in Frankfurt.  Lufthansa currently has 18 MD-11 freighters each able to
carry more than 90 metric tons. The cargo unit has recalled four
jets from desert storage as trade rebounds from the steepest
slump in six decades, and is targeting a record annual  operating
profit  after posting a nine-month figure of 230 million euros
($299 million) versus a 200 million-euro year earlier loss.  Lufthansa Cargo will establish a hub for transporting
pharmaceuticals in Hyderabad, India, to meet increasing demand
for medical shipments, Otto said. It’s also building a warehouse
for cooling freight at the Frankfurt hub which will begin
operations in the second half of next year, he said.  The German carrier’s global freight growth is likely to
average 4.6 percent in the years from 2012 to 2026, the
executive said, according to an e-mailed copy of his comments.  Specialist operators FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service
Inc. are the world’s biggest cargo carriers, with Korean Air
Lines Co. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. ranked third and
fourth, based on International Air Transport Association figures
for scheduled freight-ton kilometers in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
