Enbridge Energy Partners LP  expects
to increase the flow rate on its Line 6A crude-oil pipeline
tomorrow after repairs are completed on a pump station that
experienced a power failure Nov. 25.  “Enbridge and Lockport Terminal power utility continue
working diligently on repairs to restore power to the Lockport
Line 6A pump station,” Lorraine Grymala, a company spokeswoman
based in Superior, Wisconsin, said in an e-mail. The work is
expected to be completed tomorrow “at which time we expect to
return to pre-incident rates.”  Enbridge reduced flow rates on the line after a power
failure originating from a utility station that feeds the
Houston-based company’s Lockport terminal occurred last week.  The 670,000-barrel-a-day line runs between Superior and
Griffith, Indiana. “Enbridge continues to work with shippers to
manage scheduling, high upstream inventory levels, and feeder
reduction rates,” Grymala said.  Enbridge said Nov. 26 it expected the repairs to be
completed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
