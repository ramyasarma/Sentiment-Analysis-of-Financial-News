LCH Clearnet published in error
confidential information on the Internet about trading in
carbon-emission allowances, the Financial Times reported, citing
a statement from the clearing house.  The data, including names of individual traders, was
mistakenly placed on the website of marketing company Climate
Markets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
