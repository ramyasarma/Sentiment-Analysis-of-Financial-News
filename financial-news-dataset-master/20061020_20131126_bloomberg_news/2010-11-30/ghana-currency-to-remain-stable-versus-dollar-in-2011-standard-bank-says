Ghana’s currency, the cedi, is
poised to remain stable in 2011 even as the country’s economy
may grow faster than a government forecast of 12.3 percent,
 Standard Bank Group Ltd.  said.  The cedi will “remain in its 1.41-1.45 trading range over
the coming year” versus the dollar,  Stephen Bailey-Smith , the
London-based head of Africa research at the continent’s biggest
lender, in an e-mailed response to questions today. “We believe
the authorities are both willing and able” to preserve the
current rate.  The cedi retreated for a fourth day versus the dollar,
trading 0.3 percent weaker at 1.4535 by 1:48 p.m. in Accra,
according to Bloomberg data. Ghana’s central bank attempted to
keep the currency below 1.4500 to the dollar by selling about
$25 million on Nov. 24 and is likely to intervene again
tomorrow, Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader at  Access Bank Plc ,
said yesterday.  Ghana will begin pumping oil Dec. 15 from its offshore
Jubilee oilfield. The country will produce about 1.3 million
barrels this year as oil production alone will add 11.8 percent
to the country’s gross domestic product, Bailey-Smith said. The
overall economy may grow as much as 17.8 percent, according to
the bank’s 2011 forecast, which assumes an oil price of $90 per
barrel.  Ghana’s finance ministry forecast 12.3 percent growth next
year assuming an oil price of $70 per barrel. Crude oil for
January delivery fell 1.1 percent to $84.83 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The West African nation is Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer after South Africa and the world’s second-largest cocoa
grower after neighboring Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
