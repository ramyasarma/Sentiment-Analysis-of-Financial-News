National Bank of Canada  had its
biggest one-day decline in 10 weeks after the National Post
reported the lender cut as many as 40 jobs in the investment-
banking unit.  The Montreal-based bank fell 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
C$67.84 at 4:17 p.m. trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
biggest drop since Sept. 21.  Canada’s sixth-largest bank is cutting jobs, half of them
in Toronto, in the institutional equity division at its National
Bank Financial unit, the Post reported, citing unidentified
people.  Claude Breton, a spokesman for National Bank, declined to
comment. National Bank is scheduled to release fiscal fourth-
quarter earnings after the close of markets today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
