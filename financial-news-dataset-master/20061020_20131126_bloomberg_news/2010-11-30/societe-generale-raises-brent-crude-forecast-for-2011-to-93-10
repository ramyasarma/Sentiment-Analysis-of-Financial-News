  Societe Generale SA , France’s
second-biggest bank, raised its forecast for Brent crude oil
prices in 2011 by 9.4 percent because of rising demand for fuel
from emerging markets such as China.  Brent crude will average $93.10 a barrel next year, up from
the previous forecast of $85, according to a report e-mailed
report by the commodities research team led by Paris-based
 Frederic Lasserre . The bank also increased its estimate for oil
demand growth in 2011 to 1.6 million barrels a day from 1.4
million. Prices will also climb as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
second round of purchases of U.S. treasuries, known as
quantitative easing, pushes the dollar lower.  “We believe these drivers will be bullish for oil prices
over the next year,” the report said. Quantitative easing “and
a lower interest rate, high liquidity environment; second
bullish oil fundamentals due to strengthening oil demand and the
beginning of stockdraws to rebalance the physical markets.”  Brent crude for January settlement fell as much as 69 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $86.65 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. The contract rose $1.76, or 2.1 percent, to
$87.34 a barrel yesterday.  The bank recommended buying the December 2012 Brent crude
futures contract to take advantage of the bullish “medium-term
fundamentals.  Demand Gain  Societe Generale also increased its 2010 crude demand
growth forecast to 2.3 million barrels a day from 1.8 million.
The increases in consumption will cause the oil inventories of
the countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development to fall to 56 days of cover by the second half of
2011 from 60 days now, the bank said.  Rising demand will reduce the spare production capacity
held by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 3
million barrels a day by 2013 from 5.5 million barrels this year.  The 2011 demand growth breaks down into a 170,000 barrel
decline in the OECD countries and 1.76 million barrels gain in
emerging markets, the report said.  “The non-OECD growth is led by China, other Asia, Latin
America and the Middle East; there has been no change to that
story,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
