Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. , a
manufacturer of electric motors for automakers, surged to the
highest in more than three years in Hong Kong trading after
first-half net income rose six-fold as car sales rebounded.  The  stock  climbed as much as 18 percent to HK$6.03, the
highest level since February 2007, and traded 15 percent higher
at HK$5.83 at 12:13 p.m. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dropped
1.2 percent.  “Johnson Electric has benefited from the rebound of car
sales in the U.S. in the first half of this year,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-based research director at Cinda International
Holdings Ltd. “But investors should be cautious as Europe’s
debt crisis may slow automobile demand in the near future.”  Net income  climbed to $92.9 million for the six months
ended September, from $14.6 million a year earlier, according to
a company statement to the city’s stock exchange yesterday.  Sales jumped 27 percent to $1.03 billion as government-led
stimulus programs globally led to a “broader recovery in
industrial output compared to the extraordinarily depressed
levels at the height of the economic crisis,” Chairman  Patrick Wang  wrote in the statement.  Citigroup Inc. analyst  Eric Lau  changed the stock rating to
“buy” and increased the share-price estimate to HK$6.9 from
HK$3.1, according to a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
