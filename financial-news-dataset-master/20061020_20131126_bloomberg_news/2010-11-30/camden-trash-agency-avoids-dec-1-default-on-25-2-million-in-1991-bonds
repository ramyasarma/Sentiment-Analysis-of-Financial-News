The Camden County Pollution Control
Financing Authority in New Jersey will make the $25.2 million
final payment on its series 1991A-1991D revenue bonds as
scheduled Dec. 1, avoiding default, according to a public notice
to bondholders.  The agency won approval from New Jersey’s Department of
Environmental Protection to use restricted accounts to cover the
principal and interest on the bonds, which reach final maturity
tomorrow, according to the notice, which was sent yesterday. The
planned payment avoids what state officials said would have been
the first  New Jersey  bond default since the 1930s.  The agency operates a landfill in Pennsauken, where it is
based, and a trash-to-energy incinerator in Camden, a city where
about one-third of the residents live in poverty, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau.  The state Treasury Department, which has contributed about
$150 million to cover debt payments on the incinerator since
1999, has agreed to subsidize future payments to replenish the
restricted accounts, according to William Tambussi, authority
attorney. The state is also scheduled to pay $2.1 million of the
Dec. 1 payment, according to testimony during a Nov. 23 Local
Finance Board hearing on the incinerator debt.  Bond Prices Drop  The prospect of a default drove the price of the bonds to
as low as 53.5 cents on the dollar Nov. 22, from par on Oct. 26,
according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board trading
records compiled by Bloomberg. The price has dropped by more
than 41 percent since Nov. 12, when the state Treasurer  Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff  said his office wouldn’t cover the payment, as
it had in the past.  Moody’s Investors Service maintained its Caa1 rating on the
authority, its fifth-lowest non-investment grade, according to a
report released today. The agency will have no bonds outstanding
after the Dec. 1 payment, David Luthman, its deputy executive
director, said in a telephone interview today.  The Camden trash operation generated $36 million in
operating revenue in 2008 against $28 million in annual costs,
according to the most recent annual financial report filed for
bondholders. It received $6 million annually in state aid in
2006 and 2007 to cover debt-service expenses, the report shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
