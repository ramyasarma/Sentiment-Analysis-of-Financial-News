Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
praised nonprofit group  Wikileaks.org  for its “bravery” after
the group began to publish 250,000 diplomatic cables and said
that U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  should resign.  “I have to congratulate the people of Wikileaks for their
bravery and courage,” Chavez said today on state television.
“Clinton should resign, it’s the least she can do with all of
this spying and delinquency in the State Department.”  WikiLeaks, which releases information that governments and
businesses want to keep confidential, yesterday began posting on
its website what it says are secret, confidential or in some
cases unclassified U.S. embassy cables written from December
1966 to February 2010.  Cables revealed that the U.S. has worked with countries in
the region to try to isolate Chavez, according to Spanish
newspaper  El Pais , which was given copies of the documents in
advance. Chavez said today that those efforts have failed.  “This exposes the U.S. empire for what they are, their
mask has fallen off,” Chavez said. “They’ve tried to isolate
this soldier. It didn’t work and certainly won’t work now.”  Wikileaks is  preparing to release  more than 2,000
diplomatic
cables from the U.S. embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, the second
highest amount in Latin America after its embassy in allied
Bogota, Colombia, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
