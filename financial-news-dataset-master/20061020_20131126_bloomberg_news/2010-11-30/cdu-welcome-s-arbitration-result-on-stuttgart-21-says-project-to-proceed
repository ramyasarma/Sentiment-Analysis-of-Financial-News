German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Christian Democrats welcomed the result of arbitration talks
backing a planned high-speed rail project in Stuttgart, saying
the project will proceed “bringing jobs and competitiveness.”  The result of the mediation process between the project’s
backers, including state-owned railway Deutsche Bahn AG and the
CDU-ruled state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, and opponents including
the opposition Greens party “is in favor of the continuation of
Stuttgart 21,” CDU General Secretary Hermann Groehe said in an
e-mailed statement.  An arbitration committee chaired by Heiner Geissler
recommended modifications to the project today, which should be
undertaken with all due transparency, Groehe said.  “The talks have made clear that there will be no halt to
the project,” Groehe said. “Growth needs conduits and the new
station is a necessary and meaningful infrastructure project for
all” the state. “That’s why the CDU nationally backs the state
government.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
