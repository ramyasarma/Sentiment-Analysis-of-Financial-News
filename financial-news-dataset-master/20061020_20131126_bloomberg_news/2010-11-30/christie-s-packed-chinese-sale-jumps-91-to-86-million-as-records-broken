An ink painting by Fu Baoshi that
sold for an artist record HK$70.1 million ($9 million) helped
 Christie’s International  beat its presale estimate for the
company’s autumn Hong Kong auctions with two days still to run.  In a day dominated by mainland Chinese buyers, London-based
Christie’s sold HK$669 million of classical and modern Chinese
paintings, 91 percent more than a year earlier and more than
double the company’s estimate of HK$260 million.  “There are some quality paintings being auctioned today,”
said Ye Maozhong, 43, owner of a Beijing-based advertising
company, who bought four  Xu Beihong  (1895-1953) paintings for
about HK$30 million. “The prices are reasonable and I am happy
-- I did what I came here to do,” said Ye, wearing a red and
black sweater, black jeans and thick-rimmed glasses.  Christie’s had estimated its weeklong sale of wine, art,
antiques, watches and jewelry at the  Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Centre  would total more than HK$1.7 billion.
 Sotheby’s  sale in October raised HK$3.09 billion, beating its
previous record in the city in April by more than 50 percent.
The two are a benchmark of demand for luxury items in Asia.  “The Song of the Pipa Player” by Fu (1904-1965) sparked
one of several intense bidding battles in the afternoon session
that was won by an unidentified mainland Chinese buyer, soaring
past the HK$40 million high estimate. Chinese buyers bought 19
of the top 20 lots, including three ink paintings by  Zhang Daqian  (1899-1983) that fetched a combined HK$123 million.  Artist Records  Including today’s tally, Christie’s Hong Kong sales have so
far fetched a combined HK$1.93 billion, setting 25 artist
records.  The highlight of the morning’s sale of classical paintings
was from Bada Shanren, one of the names taken by the mercurial
Zhu Da, a 17th-century prince who became a monk and then one of
the Qing dynasty’s most famous painters. His “Mynah, Poem in
Running Script Calligraphy” sold for HK$11.3 million, more than
seven times its high estimate. His “Pine and Lingzhi,” which
had the highest presale estimate at HK$5 million, sold for
HK$10.2 million.  Yesterday, with Christie’s jewelry department all wearing
something pink in their attire, the auction house sold a 14.23
carat pink diamond for HK$179.9 million, the highest auction
price for a diamond in Asia. The sale of gems and jade raised a
total of HK$612.6 million, Christie’s biggest ever.  Balinese Legend  That followed three days of sales of Asian contemporary and
Chinese 20th-century art that broke more than a dozen artist
records, including those for Bali-based German painter Walter
Spies, whose “Balinesische Legende” (Balinese Legend) sold for
HK$16.9 million; and Chinese expatriate Sanyu, whose “Potted
Chrysanthemum in a Blue and White Jardiniere” fetched HK$53.3
million.  Christie’s art sales include a buyer’s premium of 25
percent on the first HK$400,000, 20 percent up to and including
HK$8 million, and 12 percent of the remainder. Estimates are for
the hammer price, which doesn’t include the commission.  Today, Christie’s continues with Chinese antiques,
including a selection from the Fonthill House collection,
assembled by Alfred Morrison, one of the foremost 19th-century
English collectors of Chinese art.  One of the top lots is a pair of Imperial cloisonne enamel
censers, each in the form of two cranes, from the Yongzheng
period (1723-1735), which are estimated to sell for more than
HK$120 million.  To contact the writers on the story:
