U.K. stocks rallied the most in three
months as concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
spread eased and a report showed that Chinese manufacturing
expanded for a fourth month, boosting raw-material companies.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group
Plc led bank shares higher after three days of losses. Rio Tinto
Group advanced 3.1 percent and Xstrata Plc surged 5.8 percent as
metal prices gained.  Sage Group Plc  climbed the most in 18
months as the U.K.’s largest software maker reported profit that
topped estimates.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  gained 114.23, or 2.1 percent,
to 5,642.5 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, rebounding from
yesterday’s lowest level since September. The gauge fell earlier
this week after the European Union-led bailout of Ireland failed
to reassure investors that the region will contain its
sovereign-debt crisis. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also advanced
2.1 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  rose 1.5 percent.  “We are bullish on U.K. equities and see decent upside
into the end of 2011,” UBS AG strategists  Nick Nelson  and  Karen Olney  wrote in a report dated Nov. 30, as they introduced their
6,700 estimate for the end of 2011 for the FTSE 100. That would
mark a 19 percent rally from yesterday’s close. “We see
valuation and fund flows as strongly supportive.”  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company, gained
3.1 percent to 4,207 pence. Xstrata rose 5.8 percent to 1,367
pence as copper, lead, nickel and tin prices increased on the
London Metals Exchange.  China’s Economy  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index  for November rose to
55.2, the fastest pace in seven months, from 54.7 in October,
according to the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing. The
reading beat the 54.8 median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. A PMI released by HSBC Holdings Plc also
jumped.  Sage  climbed 5.3 percent to 271 pence as the company said
full-year profit increased to 227.3 million pounds ($353.7
million), beating analysts’ estimates for 220 million pounds.
Sage generated sales of 1.44 billion pounds. Analysts had
predicted sales of 1.43 billion pounds, according to the median
of 19 estimates.  Royal Bank of Scotland  gained 6.1 percent to 39.9 pence.
Lloyds rallied 6 percent to 64.1 pence. Barclays Plc rose 4.6
percent to 268 pence.  Sovereign Swaps  The FTSE 350 Banks Index climbed 2.9 percent, the most
since Nov. 4, after having fallen for three consecutive days
amid concern that the region’s debt crisis would worsen. The
gauge climbed as Portugal and Ireland led a decline in the cost
of insuring against losses on government and corporate bonds in
Europe. Contracts on Belgium, Italy, and Spain also fell from
record levels, helping to push down the region’s benchmark index
of sovereign swaps from an all-time high.  Prudential Plc  climbed 5.5 percent to 599 pence, pacing a
rally in U.K. insurers, after saying it plans to double profit
from Asia by 2013. Aviva Plc, the U.K.’s second-biggest insurer,
rose 4.1 percent to 369.2 pence and Legal & General Group Plc
increased 3.5 percent to 94.6 pence.  Thomas Cook Group Plc  retreated 4.5 percent to 178 pence.
Europe’s second-biggest tour operator posted a full-year loss of
2.6 million pounds as the shutdown of European airspace after a
volcanic eruption disrupted the company’s travel business and
caused costs to increase.  Numis Securities Ltd. lowered its recommendation for the
tour operator to “hold” from “add.”  De La Rue Plc soared 10 percent to 637 pence, the biggest
gain in seven years, after the Financial Times cited a BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research report giving the world’s biggest
printer of banknotes a “fair value” of as much as 830 pence a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
