A former Deutsche Telekom AG
security manager was convicted today of breach of trust and
fraud for his involvement in the spy scandal at Europe’s biggest
phone company.  The Bonn Regional Court sentenced Klaus Trzeschan to a term
of three and a half years, the sentence prosecutors had sought.
The defense had asked for only a fine. Trzeschan had admitted
that he worked on the corporate spying at the company.  The case centers on allegations that managers at the
company obtained phone records for journalists and supervisory
board members to search for the sources of news leaks.
Prosecutors raided offices of Deutsche Telekom and its former T-
Mobile unit in May 2008 after the company filed a criminal
complained over the issue.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
