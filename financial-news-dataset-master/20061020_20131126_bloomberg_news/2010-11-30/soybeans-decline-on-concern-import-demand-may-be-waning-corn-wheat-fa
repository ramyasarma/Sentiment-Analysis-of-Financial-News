Soybeans declined, set for the first
monthly loss in five in Chicago, on concern that demand for the
U.S. oilseed may be waning as China, the world’s largest buyer,
cracks down on speculators.  January-delivery soybeans lost 0.3 percent to $12.3175 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 11:52 a.m. Singapore
time, headed for a 0.3 percent loss this month.  Soybeans for export, inspected at U.S. ports fell 15.1
percent to 48.9 million bushels in the week to Nov. 25, from a
week earlier, the nation’s Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter
of the oilseed.  “On the bearish front, China continued to crack down on
speculators whom it blamed for forcing up the price of many
commodities and causing inflation to rise,” Ker Chung Yang, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte. in Singapore, said in an e-
mailed report.  The government has pledged to control prices and may
increase interest rates a second time this year to slow the
fastest inflation in two years and to curb food costs that
jumped 10.1 percent in October. China will also make buying and
selling commodity futures more expensive to cool speculation.  China will sell 300,000 metric tons of soybeans in auctions
on Dec. 3, the Hefei National Grain Trade Center said in a
statement last week. The Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology will work to increase supplies of cooking oil, sugar
and cement to stabilize prices, according to a statement posted
on the ministry’s website yesterday.  Wheat Drops  Wheat for March delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $6.885 a
bushel, increasing the monthly loss for the most-active contract
to 4.3 percent. Wheat for export inspected at U.S. ports rose
4.3 percent to 20.8 million bushels in the week to Nov. 25 from
a week earlier, the USDA said. That takes the total volume bound
for shipment since June 1 to 548.9 million bushels, up 27.7
percent from a year ago.  About 47 percent of the U.S. winter-wheat crop was  rated 
good to excellent in the week ended Nov. 28, unchanged from a
week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday.
That compares with a rating of 63 percent for the same period
last year.  March-delivery corn declined 0.2 percent to $5.52 a bushel,
widening the monthly loss to 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
