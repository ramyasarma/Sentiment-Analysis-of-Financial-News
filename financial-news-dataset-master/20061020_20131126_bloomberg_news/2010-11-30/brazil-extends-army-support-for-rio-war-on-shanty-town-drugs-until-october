Rio de Janeiro’s Governor  Sergio Cabral  asked Brazil’s Defense Ministry to keep 2,000 troops in
Rio’s occupied shanty towns until October as the city tries to
reduce violence ahead of the 2014 soccer World Cup.  Rio wants the military to control the Complexo do Alemao
and Vila Cruzeiro favelas, as the shanty towns are known, until
the local police can set up bases there, Cabral said in an
 interview  on CBN radio today. In the meantime, state police will
be trained to take over from the army in these areas, Cabral
said.  “Crime won’t stop our policy to recapture territory,”
Cabral said during the interview. Support from the Defense
Ministry will help the state recover an area that was
“impregnable” until now, he said.  Complexo do Alemao, a cluster of a dozen favelas in the
northern area of Rio, was the city’s biggest crime stronghold
before it was taken over and occupied by police and armed forces
on Nov. 28. The offensive, which involved more than 20,000
police, was Brazil’s biggest security operation and aims to
restore order in the city ahead of the 2014 soccer World Cup and
the 2016 summer Olympics.  Cabral announced his request for the support of the armed
forces after a meeting with President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  in
Brasilia last night, the state government said in a  statement  on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
