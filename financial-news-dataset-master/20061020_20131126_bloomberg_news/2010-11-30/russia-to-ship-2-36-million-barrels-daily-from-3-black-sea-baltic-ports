Russia, the world’s largest oil
producer, will ship an average 2.36 million barrels of crude a
day from three ports next month, according to a loading
schedule.  The data includes the ports of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea,
and Novorossiisk and Tuapse in the Black Sea.  The country will also export 1.2 million metric tons of
East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline crude from the port of
Kozmino next month, according to the schedule.  The previous preliminary schedule showed 2.3 million
barrels a day from the three ports for November loading and 1.4
million tons of ESPO crude from Kozmino.  To contact the reporter on this story:
