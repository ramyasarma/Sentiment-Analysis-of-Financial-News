The European Commission’s economic
forecasts for Hungary "lack credibility and are professionally
unjustified," Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  told state-run
news agency  MTI  late yesterday .  The Commission’s projection is "unacceptable both ethically
and professionally" and the European Union’s executive arm has
failed "to guess correctly" all macroeconomic data over the past
5 years, Matolcsy said, according to Budapest-based MTI.  The Commission was party to two "large-scale frauds" by
approving Hungary’s  budget  targets for 2006, when the deficit
turned out to be almost twice as wide as the plan and in 2010,
when the fiscal plan contained "grave trickery," Matolcsy said,
MTI reported.  The Commission expects Hungarian  gross domestic product  to
expand 2.8 percent in 2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012 versus the
government’s projection for growth of 3 percent next year and
3.5 percent in 2012.  It forecast the budget shortfall widening to 4.7 percent of
economic output next year and 6.2 percent in 2012 from an
estimated 3.8 percent next year. The government targets a gap of
less than 3 percent in 2011. The Commission estimates don’t
include the effect of the government’s plan to direct private
pension-fund accounts to the budget.  The government is sticking to its own economic forecasts,
MTI cited Matolcsy as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
