Dubai received its first cargo of
liquefied natural gas from Qatar yesterday, said John Barry,
vice president for technical and production in the Middle East
and North Africa for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc .  “Shell is not an equity investor in the project” and serves
instead as a project and technical adviser, Barry said at a
conference in Dubai today. “Shell is also involved in sourcing
the LNG.”  Dubai began discharging the LNG at 1:00 am today, he said.  Shell said last year that it had entered an agreement to
ship Qatari LNG to Dubai in the neighboring United Arab Emirates
for 15 years. Shell is a shareholder in QatarGas4, an LNG
production plant, that is scheduled to begin producing fuel by
February.  Qatar already provides gas to the U.A.E. through the
Dolphin Energy Ltd. undersea pipeline, and the country plans to
boost its annual production capacity for LNG to 77 million tons
by the end of this year.  Shell, the largest investor in Qatar, expects its
$19 billion Pearl gas-to-liquids plant there to be fully
operational in the first quarter of 2012, Krey Stirland, the
company’s commercial manager for Qatari operations, said on
Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
