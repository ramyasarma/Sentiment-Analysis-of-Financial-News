AG Industries Ltd.  was suspended
from trading on  Johannesburg’s stock exchange  after saying a
group of banks took steps to take over assets of the glass and
aluminum products maker.  “The group is no longer in a position to trade and the
directors have instructed all the companies in the group to
cease all trading and any other activities,” AG said in a
statement to the Stock Exchange News Service today.  AG, which has a market capitalization of 86.4 million rand
($12.1 million), is considering ways to resolve the situation
and prevent the loss of 1,000 jobs.  AG on Oct. 6 reported a loss for the year through June of
192 million rand, saying that it was negatively affected by a
slowdown in construction. The stock has lost 79 percent of its
value over the last year in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
