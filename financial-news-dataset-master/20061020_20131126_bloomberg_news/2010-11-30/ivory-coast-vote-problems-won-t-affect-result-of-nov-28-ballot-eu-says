Problems in  Ivory Coast’s 
presidential election this week were not enough to affect the
results, according to a European Union observer mission in the
country.  The process was deemed acceptable in 96 percent of polling
stations, Maria Espinosa, vice chairwoman of the group. There
were “irregularities and intimidations” in some of the centers,
she said.  Ivorians are waiting for results from the run-off election
Nov. 28 that saw former Prime Minister  Alassane Ouattara 
challenge President  Laurent Gbagbo  for control of the world’s
top cocoa grower. The country has been split between the north
that supports Ouattara and the south, which Gbagbo courts for
votes, since an uprising in 2002.  Results released yesterday by the electoral commission from
ballots cast overseas showed Ouattara leading with about 60
percent and Gbagbo with 40 percent.  Cristian Preda, head of the EU mission, said they received
reports today that journalists were told to leave the
commission’s headquarters in the commercial capital. Bamba
Yacouba and Baba Coulibaly, spokesmen for the commission, didn’t
answer calls made to their mobile phones by Bloomberg today.  The area around the commission was blocked off today by
fences guarded by Ivorian soldiers and at least three vehicles
belonging to the United Nations.  Cocoa for December delivery rose $29, or 1.1 percent, to
$2,750 per metric ton by 9:20 a.m. in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
