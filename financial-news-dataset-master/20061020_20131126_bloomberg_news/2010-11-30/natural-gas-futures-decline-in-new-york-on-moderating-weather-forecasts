Natural gas futures fell for a
second day in New York on forecasts of above-normal temperatures
in the central U.S. that may limit demand for the heating fuel.  Futures dropped as warmer-than-normal weather is likely in
the central and southwestern U.S. from Dec. 10 through Dec. 14,
according to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in
Rockville, Maryland. Temperatures may be normal in the Northeast
and Great Lakes region during that period, MDA said.  “The cold would really have to be sustained for prices to
maintain this level,” said Jay Levine, the president of Enerjay
LLC, an energy advisory company in Portland, Maine. “We still
have an overhang of supply.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $4.18 per million British thermal units on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas futures rose 3.5 percent
this month and have dropped 25 percent this year.  The low temperature in Detroit on Dec. 11 may be 28 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), 3 degrees above normal, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “People are trying to determine which way the weather is
going to go,” said  Mike Rose , the director of energy trading
for Angus Jackson Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “We’re
still very well supplied, and until we see higher industrial
demand, I think we’re going to sit at these levels.”  U.S. gas production rose 3.7 percent in September as output
from onshore wells increased, the Energy Department reported
yesterday.  Gas Production  Output  climbed to 75.14 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 72.44 billion in August, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in a monthly report known as
EIA-914.  Inventories  of the fuel in the week ended Nov. 19 were 9.5
percent above the five-year average, wider than a 9.3 percent
surplus the previous week, the Energy Department said on Nov.
24. Stockpiles fell 6 billion cubic feet to 3.837 trillion cubic
feet, according to the department.  The total number of oil and natural-gas rigs operating in
the U.S. rose last week, led by an increase in natural-gas
drilling, according to data published today by Baker Hughes Inc.  Gas rigs rose by 17 to 953, Baker Hughes said. The total
was down 41 percent from a peak of 1,606 in September 2008.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 4.42 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $4.1627 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
170,271 as of 2:55 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
271,000. Volume was 245,547 yesterday. Open interest was 757,873
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 800,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
