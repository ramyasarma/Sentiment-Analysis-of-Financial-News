Shares of Reliance Communications
Ltd. dropped to a record low in Mumbai trading even as India’s
second-largest mobile-phone operator welcomed a government probe
into the ownership of Swan Telecom.  Reliance Communications fell as much as 3.7 percent to 123
rupees, the lowest price since listing in March 2006, and was at
125.55 rupees at 9:30 a.m. local time. The company has been the
worst performer on the benchmark Sensitive stock index for the
past three months, according to Bloomberg data.  Reliance Communications complied with all laws and ceased
to be shareholder in Swan before the company was given a phone
services license, Reliance said in an e-mailed statement after
the close of market hours yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
