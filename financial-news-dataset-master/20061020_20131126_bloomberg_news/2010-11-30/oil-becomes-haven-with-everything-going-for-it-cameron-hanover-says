Crude oil is becoming a haven for
investors amid declines in stocks and currencies, according to
Cameron Hanover Inc.  “The fact that oil prices have managed, yet again, to
ignore bearish dollar and equity news illustrates how far this
market has come,” the New Canaan, Connecticut-based energy
adviser said in a report yesterday. Oil “seems to have
everything going for it at this point. There was a time when oil
prices reacted to what the euro was doing; now, traders seem to
be turning to oil when they can’t turn to the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
