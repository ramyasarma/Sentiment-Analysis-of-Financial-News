Flybe, the U.K.’s biggest domestic
airline since it bought assets of  British Airways Plc  in 2007,
plans a listing on the London Stock Exchange following an
initial public offering to finance fleet expansion.  The stock sale will raise about 60 million pounds ($93
million), Chief Executive Officer  Jim French  said today in a
statement. Half of the proceeds will be used to fund the
purchase of 35 jets, half to strengthen cash balances and help
the carrier pursue acquisition opportunities, he said.  “The company has come a long way in a short time,” French
said in the statement. “A listing will assist Flybe in achieving
the next stage of its exciting strategy for growth.”  Shares of Flybe, also Europe’s biggest regional carrier,
may be priced at 285 pence to 385 pence, according to terms of
the deal obtained by Bloomberg News, with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch the sole sponsor and bookrunner and Investec and
Execution Noble as lead managers. The IPO is likely to be priced
on Dec. 9, with the stock trading a day later, the terms show.  Pretax profit at Flybe dropped 47 percent to 6.8 million
pounds in the year ended March 31 as the recession hurt demand
for flights, prompting the Exeter, England-based carrier to cut
fares. The passenger total fell 1.3 percent to 7.2 million.  BA Purchase  Founded in 1979 as Jersey European Airways after the island
in the English Channel to which it flew, the company was renamed
British European in 2000 before taking on its current identity
two years later after switching to a low-cost strategy.  Flybe acquired  British Airways ’ BA Connect unit for 521
million pounds in 2006, adding more than 50 routes and doubling
the number of customers to become No. 1 in Europe’s regional
market, where smaller planes serve secondary routes.  The company ordered 35 88-seat  Embraer  175 regional jets
valued at $1.3 billion in July from Brazil’s Empresa Brasileira
de Aeronautica SA, together with options for 65 planes and
“purchase rights” for a further 40. The current fleet consists
of 14 Embraer 195 jets and 54 Bombardier Inc. Q400 turboprops.  The family trust of late steel tycoon  Jack Walker  owns 69
percent of Flybe stock, with employees holding about 16 percent.
 British Airways , Europe’s third-largest carriers, owns a 15
percent stake and will buy enough shares to maintain that level.  French said on Sept. 20 that Flybe is in talks over two
purchases as it seeks to build bases in continental Europe, with
the potential deals “digestible” rather than “transformational.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
