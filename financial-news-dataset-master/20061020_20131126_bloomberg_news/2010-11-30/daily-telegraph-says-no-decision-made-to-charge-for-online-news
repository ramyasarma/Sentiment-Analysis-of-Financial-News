Telegraph Media Group’s Daily
Telegraph, Britain most-read broadsheet newspaper, said it
hasn’t decided on whether to charge readers to access its
content online.  The Financial Times reported earlier today the Telegraph
planned to erect a paywall for its news content next year.  “Absolutely no decisions have been made on the
introduction of a paid-content model,” the London-based
Telegraph said in a statement. Like its peers, the Telegraph
“continually evaluates the developments in the digital
sector,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
