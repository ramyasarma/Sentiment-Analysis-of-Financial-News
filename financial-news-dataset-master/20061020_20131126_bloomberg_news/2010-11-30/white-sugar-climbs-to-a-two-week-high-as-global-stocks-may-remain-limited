Sugar declined, snapping a five-
session rally, after India said it may allow exports next month.
Coffee also dropped, and cocoa gained.  Sharad Pawar, India’s farm minister, said that the
government will decide on easing sugar-export curbs in the third
week of December. The Indian Sugar Mills Association said the
nation, the world’s second-biggest producer, may allow sales of
as much as 2 million metric tons in the year started Oct. 1.
Prices fell 5.4 percent in November, the first monthly decline
since May.  “News from India sent the market down in a hurry,” said
 Marius Sonnen , the president of Sonnen & Co., a New York-based
sugar trader. “People want some clarity on the amount of sugar
that will be available from India.”  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 0.8 cent, or 2.8
percent, to settle at 27.55 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price rose 8.4 percent in the
previous five sessions.  India will have “adequate” sugar for local use in the
year started Oct. 1 with output at 24.5 million tons and
domestic use at 22.5 million to 23 million tons, said K.V.
Thomas, a junior farm minister. Inventories from the previous
season were 5.1 million tons following two years in which supply
trailed demand, he said.  ‘Off the Table’  “One could point a finger at the announcements from India
for today’s fall,” said  Jeff Bauml , a senior vice president at
R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in New York. “Also, a lot
of traders are taking their chips off the table as they head
into the holiday season.”  Sugar prices gained 22 percent in the past 12 months.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery dropped
$17.80, or 2.5 percent, to $710 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 1.45 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.012 a pound in New York, the fourth
straight drop.  Robusta-coffee futures for March delivery advanced $10, or
0.6 percent, to $1,809 a ton in London, after earlier falling as
much as 1.1 percent.  Cocoa futures for March delivery gained $52, or 1.9
percent, to $2,807 a ton in New York.  Exports from  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer,
fell 17 percent in October from a year earlier, according to
data from the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro.  Ivory Coast harvests its main cocoa crop from October to
March.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery rose 38 pounds,
or 2 percent, to 1,904 pounds ($2,968) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
