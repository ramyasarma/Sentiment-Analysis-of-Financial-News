Japan’s  bonds  rose the most in almost
two weeks as speculation Europe’s debt crisis will spread caused
investors to seek the refuge of government debt.  Benchmark  yields  fell from a three-month high after the
Wall Street Journal said European policy makers are planning a
more rigorous round of “stress tests” for banks. Bonds also
gained after Bank of Japan board member  Miyako Suda  said the
chance deflation will end in Japan in the fiscal year starting
April 2011 isn’t high. The government sold 2.2 trillion yen ($26
billion) of 10-year bonds today.  “It will take a strong consensus among European nations to
eliminate investor concerns about the region’s debt markets,”
said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps oversee $11 billion as a manager
of fixed-income trading at Okasan Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“People are turning to safer assets like JGBs and U.S. bonds.”  The yield on the 1 percent bond due September 2020 fell 4.5
basis points to 1.14 percent as of 3:51 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.391 yen to 98.767 yen.  The decline in yield was the most since Nov. 19. They
earlier climbed to 1.195 percent, matching the highest level
since Sept. 6.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.46 to
141.33 at the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Debt Crisis  Concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen has shifted to
Portugal and Spain since Nov. 28, when the region’s governments
gave Ireland an 85 billion-euro ($110.8 billion) rescue package.
Standard & Poor’s said yesterday it may cut Portugal’s credit
ratings on concern the government has made little progress on
boosting economic growth to offset the fiscal drag from
scheduled 2011 budgetary cuts.  “External factors are not justifying an ongoing hike in
yields, as Europe’s debt issue reemerges and an increase in U.S.
yields takes a pause,” said  Naomi Hasegawa , a senior debt
strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co., a unit of Japan’s largest lender by assets. “Market
participants are poised to look for reasons to buy back bonds.”  Ten-year yields may drop to 1.10 percent by year-end,
Hasegawa said. Should her forecast prove accurate, investors who
buy the securities today will make a 0.5 percent return,
Bloomberg calculations show.  The gain in bonds was tempered as the 10-year auction drew
less demand than some traders forecast.  The lowest price at the sale was 100.01 yen, below the
100.10 median forecast of 14 traders in a Bloomberg News survey.
The offering drew bids for 2.41 times the amount on offer, down
from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.91 times at the
previous auction in November.  “The auction ended weaker than I had expected,” said
 Satoshi Yamada , chief quantitative analyst in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “But bonds are being supported as
people buy them on dips with yields around 1.2 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
