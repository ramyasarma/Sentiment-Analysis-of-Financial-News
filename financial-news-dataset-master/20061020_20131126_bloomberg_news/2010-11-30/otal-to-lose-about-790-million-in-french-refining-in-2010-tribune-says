Total SA will lose about 600 million
euros ($787 million) in its French refining operations this year,
compared with a loss of 1 billion euros in 2009, daily La Tribune
said, citing Chief Financial Officer Patrick de la Chevardiere.  The loss includes an impact of between 130 million and 150
million euros from strikes against French pension reform, the
newspaper said.  Total has received several offers for its U.K. service
stations, La Tribune said, without elaborating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
