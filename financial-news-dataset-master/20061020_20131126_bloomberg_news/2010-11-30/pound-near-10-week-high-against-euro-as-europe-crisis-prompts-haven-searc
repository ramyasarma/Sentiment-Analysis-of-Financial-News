The pound advanced to its strongest
in 10 weeks against the euro as concern that the common-currency
area’s debt crisis will worsen spurred investors to buy British
assets as they sought safer alternatives.  Sterling rose for a second day and posted its biggest
monthly gain since January 2009 against the common currency. The
extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity gilts surged to the most since
March 2009.  “The pound is deemed to be a haven from the euro area,”
said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “The fact that it’s outside the
euro currency area is seen to have tangible benefits, and
sterling may well outperform.”  The pound gained 0.6 percent to 83.75 pence per euro as of
5:04 p.m. in London, after climbing to 83.52 pence, its
strongest since Sept. 20. That pushed its gains since the end of
October to 3.6 percent. It was little changed at $1.5569.  Gains in gilts pushed the 10-year note yield down twelve
basis points to 3.22 percent, paring it appreciation since Oct.
29 to 18 basis points. The two-year  yield  fell nine basis points
to 0.9 percent, paring its advance this month to six basis
points.  The  spread  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts instead
of German bunds with a similar maturity was at 55 basis points
today, down from 71 basis points a week ago. The spread was as
high as 103 basis points in May, the most this year.  Peripheral Bonds  Gilts are still set for their first back-to-back monthly
losses since May 2009, according to indexes developed by Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit. U.K. government securities
have gained 7 percent since the end of 2009, compared with 1.4
percent by the 16 nations that share the euro, the gauges show.  Losses by bonds in Europe’s so-called peripheral debt
markets sent the spread between 10-year Italian securities and
similar-maturity German debt to more than 200 basis points for
the first time since 1997. Ten-year gilts yielded 144 basis
points less than similar-maturity Italian securities today.  Against the dollar, the pound has lost 2.9 percent since
Oct. 29, set for the biggest monthly loss since May.  An index of consumer sentiment declined 2 points to minus
21, GfK NOP Ltd., a research group in London said in an e-mailed
statement today. Economists predicted no change from minus 19 in
October, according to the median of 13 forecasts in a  Bloomberg
News survey . A measure of sentiment on the economy for the
coming year fell 2 points to minus 22.  Britain’s currency has risen 0.5 percent in the past month,
compared with a 3.7 percent decline by the euro and a 3.8
percent gain by the U.S. currency, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the
performance of a basket of 10 developed-country currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
