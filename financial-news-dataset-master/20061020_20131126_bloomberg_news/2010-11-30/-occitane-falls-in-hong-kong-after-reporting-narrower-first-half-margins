L’Occitane International SA , the
French maker of skin-care products, perfumes and soaps, dropped
the most in almost seven months in Hong Kong trading after
reporting first half profit margin narrowed.  L’Occitane , the first French company to hold an initial
public offering in Hong Kong,  slid  6.1 percent to HK$20.95, the
biggest decline since its debut in May. The benchmark Hang Seng
Index fell 0.7 percent.  Profit margin  contracted to 9 percent in the six months
ended September from 9.7 percent a year ago, the company
reported yesterday. Operating margin narrowed to 11.5 percent
from 12.5 percent. The contraction was because of expenses on
store expansion and marketing,  Aaron Fischer , an analyst at CLSA
Asia Pacific Markets, said in an interview today.  “There’s some disappointment because of the lower margins,
but we were quite positive on the state of results,” Fischer
said by phone. “Today’s a bit of profit-taking, and the current
weakness is a buying opportunity.”  First half net income  grew  19 percent to 29.8 million euros
($39.1 million) and sales expanded 28 percent to 331 million
euros, L’Occitane said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  Today’s decline trims L’Occitane’s  gain  since it started
trading on May 7 to 39 percent. The Hang Seng has gained 14
percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
