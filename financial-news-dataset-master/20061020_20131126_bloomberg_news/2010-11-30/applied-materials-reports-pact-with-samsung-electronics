Applied Materials Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of chipmaking equipment, agreed to sell gear to
 Samsung Electronics Co.  at a discount for three years as part of
an accord to avoid lawsuits related to industrial espionage.  Santa Clara, California-based Applied Materials will
provide “volume-based rebates” on purchases of semiconductor
products by Samsung and its affiliates, the U.S. company said in
a statement yesterday. The agreement started Nov. 1.  South Korean prosecutors charged 10 employees of Applied
Materials in connection with leaks of Samsung’s chip-making
technologies to smaller rival Hynix Semiconductor Inc. through
the equipment maker for more than four years, the  Seoul Eastern
District Prosecutors’ Office  said Feb. 3. No charges were
brought against the companies. Applied Materials said in
February that its former South Korea head was among those
indicted.  Samsung has “agreed to reconcile with Applied Materials
related to technology leaks,” Nam Ki Young, a spokesman at the
Suwon, South Korea-based company, said by telephone, declining
to provide further details because they’re confidential.  The agreement does not affect criminal charges against
individuals, including the ongoing proceedings against the
current and former employees at Applied Materials’ South Korean
branch pending in the Seoul Eastern District Court, the
statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
