Derek Jeter  responded to the New
York Yankees’ $45 million, three-year offer by suggesting a
package averaging about $23 million a year for four or five
seasons, the Associated Press reported.  The AP, quoting a baseball executive familiar with the
negotiations who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the All-Star shortstop and the Yankees haven’t held
contract talks in more than a week.  The executive also told the AP that Jeter’s agent,  Casey Close , first suggested a deal averaging about $25 million a year
for six years. Those figures were first reported last week by
the Daily News, and Close then told the Star-Ledger in an e-mail
message that “the recently rumored terms of our contract
proposal are simply inaccurate.”  Jeter’s 10-year, $189 million contract expired last season,
when he batted .270 with a .340 on-base percentage, both the
lowest since he became a full-time player in 1996. Jeter, 36, is
an 11-time All-Star who has won five World Series titles in 16
years with the Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
