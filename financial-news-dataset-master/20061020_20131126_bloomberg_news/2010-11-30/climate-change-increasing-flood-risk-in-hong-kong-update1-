Climate change is increasing the
risk of flooding in Hong Kong and China’s Pearl River Delta,
according to a report by the  Civic Exchange  think tank and
researchers at the University of Leeds.  Sea levels in the region may rise 20 centimeters (7.9
inches) by 2050, forcing more than a million people to move to
higher areas, according to the report.  The Hong Kong Observatory has recorded a higher incidence
of heavy rain storms in the past decade, increasing the risk of
flooding in lowland areas of the delta, the study showed.  The authorities in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong
province need to formulate a regional strategy to tackle the
problem and more information should be released about which
areas are at risk, Christine Loh, Civic Exchange’s chief
executive officer, told a media briefing in Hong Kong today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
