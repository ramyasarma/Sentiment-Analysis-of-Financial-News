Corn declined in Chicago on
speculation rainfall in South America will increase crops of the
grain.  As much as 3 inches of rain fell in parts of Brazil and
Argentina, the biggest corn exporters behind the U.S., in the
past three days and about 2.5 inches more may fall this week,
Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report.  “It’s difficult to pick a fundamental direction in prices
for the rest of the year,” said  Alexander Bos , an analyst at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London. “The dryness in Argentina is
supportive, though there’s rain in the forecast. Argentina will
be the big concern in the next few months.”  Corn for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$5.5125 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain has gained 33 percent this year as dry
weather in August curbed U.S. production. Prices have declined
5.3 percent this month after five gains in a row.  Soybeans for January delivery dropped 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $12.34 a bushel. The oilseed has jumped 11 percent
since the end of September on rising Chinese demand and is
little changed this month after four monthly gains in a row.  Wheat for March delivery was unchanged at $6.905 a bushel.
The grain has advanced 4.4 percent since the end of July as the
worst Russian drought in a half-century curbed production and
caused the country’s government to ban exports. Wheat has slid
3.7 percent in November.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris gained 0.3 percent to 223 euros ($290.64) a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
