Daimler AG ’s truck unit, the
world’s largest maker of heavy vehicles, said its return on
sales may average 8 percent in the next three years as markets
rebound.  Industrywide demand for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks
will increase by 8 percent to 2.6 million vehicles through 2013,
when the market is likely to peak, while Daimler will probably
boost annual deliveries by more than 40 percent to exceed
500,000 in the period, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said
today in a statement.  Daimler Trucks, which shut plants in Asia and North America
and shed workers during the recession, posted 500 million euros
($651 million) in operating  profit  in the third quarter after
losing 127 million euros a year earlier. Truckmakers including
 Volvo AB , MAN SE and  Scania AB  boosted orders after demand
slumped during the sharpest contraction since World War II.  “The economy is rebounding, and with it the demand for
commercial vehicles,”  Andreas Renschler , the head of Daimler
Trucks, said in the statement. “It’s true that this is market-
specific and is happening at different speeds from market to
market, but the indications overall are positive worldwide.”  The division’s  return on sales  was a negative 5.5 percent
in 2009. The three-year target would beat margins of 5.6 percent
in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2007. Daimler’s bus unit is aiming
for earnings before interest and taxes of 6 percent of sales
throughout the business cycle, the company said. That would
compare with 4.3 percent last year and 8.4 percent in 2008.  Savings programs totaling 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion)
at Daimler Trucks’  North American  operations and the Fuso brand
in Japan are ahead of schedule, the company said.  Truck markets this year will expand by 5 percent in Europe,
10 percent to 15 percent in North America, 50 percent in Brazil,
and 20 percent to 30 percent in Japan, Daimler said.  Daimler, which is also the world’s second-largest maker of
luxury cars,  rose  as much as 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 50.35
euros and was up 0.3 percent as of 10:11 a.m. in Frankfurt
trading. The stock has gained 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
