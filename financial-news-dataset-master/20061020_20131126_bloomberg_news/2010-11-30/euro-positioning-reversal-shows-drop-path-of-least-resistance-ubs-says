A reversal of futures traders’ bets
that the euro will gain against the U.S. dollar shows the
currency may decline through the end of the year, UBS AG said.  “Current positioning should offer no significant obstacle
to further downside” for the euro against the dollar, Gareth Berry , a currency strategist in Singapore, wrote in a note to
clients today. “The developing sovereign risk crisis inside the
euro zone has become the central theme. Further euro-dollar
weakness looks like the path of least resistance as year-end
approaches.”  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 8,293 on Nov. 23,
compared with net longs of 8,606 a week earlier, according to
figures published yesterday by the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  The euro was little changed at $1.3113 as of 7:12 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
