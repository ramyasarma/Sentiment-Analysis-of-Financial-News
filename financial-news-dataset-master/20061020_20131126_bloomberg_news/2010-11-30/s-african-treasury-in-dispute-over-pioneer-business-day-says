South Africa’s National Treasury has
hired legal counsel to argue against a settlement brokered
between Pioneer Foods Ltd. and the Department of Economic
Development that allows it to pay 250 million rand into an
agrobusiness fund rather than the National Revenue Fund,
Business Day reported, citing the Treasury.   Pioneer, which is based in Paarl, faces an 855 million rand
penalty for anticompetitive behavior.    The agreement breaches the constitution and the rules of
public finance, the Treasury said, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
