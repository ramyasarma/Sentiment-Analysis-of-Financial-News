Porsche SE common shareholders
approved their half of a 5 billion-euro ($6.5 billion) share
sale that the sports-car maker is seeking to reduce debt before
merging with Volkswagen AG.  Holders of common stock, which is controlled by the Piech
and Porsche families, unanimously backed the measure, the
Stuttgart, Germany-based carmaker announced at today’s annual
general meeting.   Preferred shareholders still need to vote this evening
whether to back their half of the capital increase. Porsche
needs at least 75 percent approval from both share classes for
the full measure to pass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
