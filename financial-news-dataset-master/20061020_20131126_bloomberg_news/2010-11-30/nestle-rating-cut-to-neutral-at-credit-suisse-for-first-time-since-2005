Nestle SA , the world’s largest food
company, had its share rating cut at Credit Suisse for the first
time in almost six years after the stock’s outperformance versus
peers caused the brokerage to reassess its opinion.  The  recommendation  was lowered to “neutral” from
“outperform,” where it had been since January 2005. The shares
trade at 17 times profit, a premium to peers, compared with a
price-earnings ratio of 12 in 2005, when they were at a discount
to rivals, Credit Suisse analyst  Alex Molloy  wrote in a report.  No analyst has a sell rating on Nestle, and almost 60
percent of recommendations are “buy,” according to Bloomberg
data. The stock, which touched a record last week, fell as much
as 1.7 percent today, the  steepest intraday drop  since Aug. 6.  “It may be time to draw breath” as the stock trades at a
15 percent premium to U.S. and European peers, Molloy wrote.  Nestle has less potential to improve profitability after
increasing its food and beverage operating margin to 13.5
percent this year, excluding  acquisitions , from 11.8 percent in
2005, according to the analyst.  Credit Suisse estimates that 40 percent of the gain in
Nestle shares since the March 2002 initial public offering of
its Alcon Inc. unit came from the eye-care company. Nestle sold
its remaining majority stake in Alcon in August.  Nestle Chairman  Peter Brabeck-Letmathe  is vice chairman of
Credit Suisse Group AG, which advised Nestle on its sale of
Alcon to Novartis AG and the acquisitions of the Gerber baby
food brand and medical nutrition unit from the same Basel,
Switzerland-based drugmaker. Credit Suisse provided investment
banking services to Nestle in the past 12 months, the note said.  Buybacks, Dividends  Nestle fell 1.2 Swiss francs, or 2.2 percent, to 54.55, its
biggest drop since May 7. The  stock  touched a record 56.90
francs in intraday trading on Nov. 26 and has risen 15 percent
in the past year, giving a market value of 189 billion Swiss
francs, more than any other European company.  Nestle shares have gained about 43 percent in the past five
years,  compared with  a 1.9 percent gain in Kraft Foods Inc., the
world’s second-largest food company.  Nestle, which got $28.3 billion for its majority stake in
Alcon, will probably return most of the cash it has accumulated
through buybacks and  dividends  over the coming three years,
Molloy said in the report.  The KitKat maker may spend 7.5 billion francs a year on
buybacks and 2 billion francs to 3 billion francs annually on
acquisitions, which would leave Nestle with net debt of about
19.5 billion francs at the end of 2013, he said.  Nestle will probably maintain its stake of about 30 percent
in L’Oreal SA as an acquisition of the cosmetics maker wouldn’t
make “financial or commercial sense,” Molloy wrote.  “Nestle’s business today is in terrific shape, and there
is more to come,” Molloy also wrote. Earnings per share will
rise 3 percent this year and 6 percent in 2011, he estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
