(Corrects to say Monaco is a vice chancellor in first
paragraph.)  Tufts University named Anthony P.
Monaco, a physician, neuroscientist and a vice chancellor at the
University of Oxford in England, as its next president.  Monaco, 51, will take over next year, the university in
Medford, Massachusetts, said today on its website. In his
academic research, Monaco identified the first gene specifically
involved in human speech and language, according to Tufts.  Monaco earned an undergraduate degree at Princeton
University in Princeton, New Jersey, and his M.D. and Ph.D. at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He has spent the
last 20 years at Oxford and is a native of Wilmington, Delaware.
 Tufts  conducted an international search, considering candidates
from business, public service, nonprofits and academia, James A.
Stern, chairman of Tufts board of trustees, said in a letter.  “ Anthony Monaco  is a pioneering life scientist with a
record of exceptional accomplishment as a university leader,
biomedical researcher and teacher,” Stern said. “Tony will
bring to the presidency of Tufts deeply held commitments to
academic excellence, diversity, a global perspective and the
university’s central role in society.”  Monaco succeeds  Lawrence S. Bacow , who announced in
February that he would step down in 2011 after 10 years as
president.  Tufts was founded in 1852. Graduates include Pierre
Omidyar, chairman of EBay Inc., and  Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan Chase
& Co.’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
