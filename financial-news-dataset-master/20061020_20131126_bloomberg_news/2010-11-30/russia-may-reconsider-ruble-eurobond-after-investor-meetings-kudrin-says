Russia may reconsider a plan to
offer ruble-denominated Eurobonds after meeting with investors,
Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  The government is meeting bond investors this week to gauge
potential interest in the offering and hasn’t set terms for the
sale, Kudrin told reporters in Moscow today.  Russia in April sold its first foreign-currency bond since
defaulting on $40 billion of domestic debt in 1998. The
government plans its first overseas sale of ruble debt this year
and may sell as much as $3 billion of the bonds with maturities
of as much as five years, Deputy Finance Minister  Dmitry Pankin 
said on Sept. 8.  "This will be decided together with the consultants at the
time of the issue," Kudrin said. "So far, we are holding a
roadshow. We are finding out the conditions. If we don’t like
the terms, we may weigh the necessity of the sale."  The world’s biggest energy exporter in April sold $5.5
billion of five-year and 10-year dollar notes.  The government expects to spend $6.9 billion next year
servicing its external debt, up from $2.9 billion in 2010 and
the largest amount for any year until 2019, according to the
Eurobond sale’s prospectus, obtained by Bloomberg. The annual
cost of servicing debt is estimated at $4.5 billion in 2012 and
$4.2 billion in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
