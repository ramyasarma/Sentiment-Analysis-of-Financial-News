Italian teenager  Matteo Manassero 
became the youngest golfer to be named European Tour rookie of
the year following a record-breaking start to his professional
career.  Manassero, 17, turned professional in May and earned
890,401 euros ($1.2 million) in 14 events. He’s the youngest
tournament winner in European Tour history and finished 31st on
the  Road to Dubai  money list.  “I never expected to win on tour so quickly and to win the
Rookie of the Year Award is a perfect way to end my first season
as a professional,” Manassero said in a statement.  Manassero captured his first title at the Castello Masters
last month in his 11th start as a professional. At 17 years and
188 days, he broke the record for youngest winner on the
European Tour set by  Danny Lee , who was 18 years and 213 days
when he won the Johnnie Walker Classic in 2009.  Manassero was also the youngest person to become a full
member of the European Tour, topping the mark set by  Seve Ballesteros , who was 17 years and 200 days when he joined in
1974.  He’s the first Italian recipient of the Rookie of the Year
Award, which is selected by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of
St. Andrews, the Association of Golf Writers and the European
Tour. The award began in 1960.  To contact the reporter on this story:
