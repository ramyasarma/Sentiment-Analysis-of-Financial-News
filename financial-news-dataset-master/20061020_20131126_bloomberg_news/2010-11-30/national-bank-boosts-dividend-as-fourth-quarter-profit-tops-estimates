National Bank of Canada  raised its
dividend more than analysts expected, becoming the first of
Canada’s six biggest banks to increase the payout in two years.  The bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 4 cents, or 6.5
percent, to 66 cents a share, the Montreal-based lender said in
a statement today. It’s the first dividend increase since 2007
for Canada’s sixth-biggest bank.  The dividend was raised after fourth-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates. Net income for the period ended Oct. 31
climbed to C$287 million ($280 million), or C$1.66 a share, from
C$241 million, or C$1.39, a year earlier. National, the first
lender to report fourth-quarter results, was forecast to earn
C$1.57 a share, based on a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  Canada’s six largest banks are expected to reduce loan-loss
provisions by 37 percent in the fourth quarter, lifting overall
profit, according to Canaccord Genuity analyst  Mario Mendonca .
National Bank set aside C$37 million for bad loans in the
quarter, a 31 percent decline.  National Bank’s dividend increase surpassed the  Bloomberg
Dividend Forecast  of 64 cents a share. The forecast is based on
company guidance, analysts’ estimates and other factors. Other
Canadian lenders may raise their payouts this quarter or next
year, after the country’s financial-services regulator in
September told banks they no longer need “increased
conservatism” in capital management.  “They are probably on the leading edge of one of those
banks where it’s going to be a greater allocation to dividend
and share buybacks,” said  Craig Fehr , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co. in St. Louis. “They don’t have the robust
opportunities” that other Canadian banks have, he said.  Stock Declines  National Bank fell 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to C$67.84 at
4:17 p.m. trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares
climbed 13 percent this year, compared with the 7 percent
increase on the  S&P/TSX Banks Index .  Before one-time items, National Bank earned C$1.63 a share,
topping the C$1.55-a-share average  estimate  of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg news. Revenue was little changed at almost
C$1.1 billion.  The results include a C$15 million charge for severance pay
in the investment-banking unit. The National Post reported
earlier today that the bank cut as many as 40 jobs in the unit,
according to unidentified people.  Personal and commercial banking profit rose 34 percent to
C$145 million as loans rose. Wealth management earnings climbed
19 percent to C$31 million. Financial markets, which includes
investment-banking operations, fell 29 percent to C$104 million
on lower trading revenue.  Record Profit  For the year, National Bank earned a record profit of
C$1.03 billion, up 21 percent from C$854 million in fiscal 2009.  Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce are scheduled to report results Dec. 2, followed by
Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia on Dec. 3. Bank of
Montreal and Canadian Western Bank release results Dec. 7 and
Laurentian Bank reports Dec. 8.  (National Bank will hold a conference call tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
