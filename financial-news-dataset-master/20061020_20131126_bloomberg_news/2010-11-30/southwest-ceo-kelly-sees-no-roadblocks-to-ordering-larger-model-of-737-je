Southwest Airlines Co.  Chief
Executive Officer  Gary Kelly  said he sees no roadblocks to
converting  Boeing Co.  737-700 orders to larger, more fuel-
efficient 737-800 models.  “The 800 is a very good airplane for the mission,” Kelly
said in an interview today in Washington. “It is more cost
effective than the 700 is, in many cases, for us. It allows us
to seriously consider service to places like Hawaii.”  Asked whether there was anything he knew of that would stop
Southwest from changing the plane orders to 800s, Kelly said,
“No. In other words, as we continue to prepare our projects and
our work plans, we’ve only confirmed what we believe.”  The  Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association , the union for
cockpit crews, is scheduled to announce tomorrow whether members
approved contract terms that would allow the Dallas-based
carrier to fly the 800 model. Southwest is the  largest operator 
of Boeing 737s, the only type of aircraft it flies.  “The pilot vote is obviously a key milestone,” said
Kelly, who declined to predict the outcome. “Once we have that
in hand, I think virtually all the obstacles are cleared at that
point, assuming that they agree.”  Kelly said he expects the airline to make a final decision
next month. Southwest had said it would need to declare by
tomorrow whether to convert some existing 700 orders to 800s for
the planes to be delivered in 2012. Flight attendants approved
contract revisions Nov. 18.  A Southwest 737-800 would have 175 seats, 28 percent more
than a 737-700, the airline has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
