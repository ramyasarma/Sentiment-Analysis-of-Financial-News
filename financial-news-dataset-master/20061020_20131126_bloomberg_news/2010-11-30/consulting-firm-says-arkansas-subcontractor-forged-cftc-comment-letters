Forged comment letters sent to the
U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commissio n were generated by a
subcontractor to a Boston-based public relations firm hired to
influence how regulators will implement rules for derivatives
trading.  The Dewey Square Group, which confirmed the campaign and
said it had been unaware that the letters were fraudulent, would
not identify its client.  Bloomberg News reported yesterday that forged comment
letters purportedly from an  H.J. Heinz  Co. executive, a Burger
King Co. franchise and at least five other Arkansas-based
officials or businesses were sent to the CFTC.  “Dewey Square had no reason whatsoever to believe that the
letters were not authentic and had no knowledge that they were
in fact unauthorized until questions were raised in media
accounts,”  Ginny Terzano , principal of Dewey Square, said in a
statement today.  Dewey Square Group ran a multi-state grassroots advocacy
campaign and hired Goggans Inc., a Little Rock, Arkansas-based
lobbying firm, to help build support, Terzano said. Dewey Square
hired Goggans between the middle of October and the middle of
November, Terzano said. The forged letters were sent by a
contractor for Goggans, said Miles Goggans, the firm’s founder.  The fraudulent letters to the CFTC were critical of banks
for their “cartel-like control” of the $583 trillion swaps
market. The letters were in response to a CFTC proposal to limit
conflicts of interest in clearinghouses and trading platforms in
the swaps market. Dewey Square said some letters also were sent
to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is considering
similar rules.  Nasdaq Response  Nasdaq OMX Group  Inc. was among financial companies that
lobbied U.S. lawmakers during the Dodd-Frank debate on ownership
restrictions on derivatives clearinghouses, according to
congressional lobbying records.  Nasdaq, which is a majority owner of a swap clearinghouse,
International Derivatives Clearing Group LLC, hired  Michael Oxley , former chairman of the House Financial Services
Committee, in November 2009 to lobby on legislation sponsored by
Representative  Stephen Lynch , a Massachusetts Democrat, to cap
ownership stakes in clearinghouses, according to congressional
records.  Frank De Maria, senior vice president of corporate
communications at Nasdaq OMX, declined to comment today on
whether the company had hired Dewey Square.  Terzano said in an interview that Dewey Square does not
disclose its list of clients. “Dewey Square works for many
coalitions, nonprofits, businesses and organizations,” she
said.  In a separate statement, Goggans said he had been unaware
of the forgeries.  ‘Deeply Regret’  “This action was the sole doing of a subcontractor of mine
who has worked for me only this past year,” Goggans said. “I
deeply regret what this has done to these Arkansas businesses
and individuals, and deeply regret that this inexcusable conduct
occurred in the course of work I performed for Dewey Square, a
firm that has the highest standards of professionalism and
ethics.”  According to his website, Goggans was an aide to former
Arkansas Senator  David Pryor , a Democrat, working on agriculture
issues. Goggans’s site includes a photo of him standing next to
Pryor’s son, incumbent Arkansas Senator  Mark Pryor , in hunting
gear at what is described as an east Arkansas dove hunt.  The site says Goggans has been lobbying since 1993. “A
single word describes our attitude about relationships and our
success,” the site says. “Trust.”  The fraudulent letters were among more than 150 comments
sent to the CFTC on the swaps clearinghouse proposal, which
stems from the Dodd-Frank finance-regulatory overhaul enacted in
July.  Identical Language  The letters contained nearly identical language and
included signatures from Arkansas public officials, including
Dallas County Sheriff Donny Ford and Washington County Judge
Marilyn Edwards.  Edwards has turned the matter over to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said George Butler, the civil attorney for
Washington County. Butler said falsifying letters from a public
official is a felony under Arkansas state law.  “It does appear to constitute forgery,” he said.  The letters also appear to violate the federal False
Statements Act, said Ronald M. Jacobs, an attorney at  Venable
LLP . The act makes it a felony to send false statements to
regulators.  “It would pretty clearly apply to a forged comment letter
to a government agency, and so there are fines and prison terms
that could be associated with that crime,” Jacobs said.  Political campaigns, public relations firms and consultants
sometimes use form letters to generate apparent grassroots
support for their points of view from individuals, small
businesses and citizen groups.  Climate Letters  A case of fraudulent letters surfaced a year ago during the
debate over energy and climate change legislation. U.S.
Representative  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat, said at
a hearing on Oct. 29, 2009 that his investigators found more
than a dozen forged letters sent to U.S. lawmakers as part of a
campaign run by the Washington-based political consulting firm
Bonner & Associates, under contract with the American Coalition
for Clean Coal Electricity.  No charges have been filed in the matter. Jacobs, who
advised the ACCE at the time, said The False Statements Act
exempts letters sent to Congress.  The derivatives rule in question was proposed in October by
CFTC commissioners, who requested public comments by Nov. 17.
The CFTC must complete a rulemaking by Jan. 14.  Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked
to specific events such as changes in interest rates or the
weather.  Reducing Risk  The Dodd-Frank law aims to move over-the-counter swaps
trades to clearinghouses, in order to reduce risk in the
financial system by requiring parties to post collateral. The
law directs regulators to write rules for the clearinghouses to
limit conflicts of interest.  The CFTC’s proposed regulation would allow clearinghouses
to choose between two types of ownership restrictions. Under the
first, there would be a 20 percent cap on a clearinghouse
member’s equity stake or voting control and a 40 percent cap on
the collective stake that members and restricted non-member
companies could hold in one clearinghouse.  Restricted Companies  The restricted companies would include bank holding
companies with at least $50 billion in assets, non-bank
financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve, swap
dealers, major swap users and their affiliates.  The second option would impose a 5 percent cap on the
ownership stake and control any clearinghouse member or non-
member could have. The second option wouldn’t include an
aggregate cap.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,
which represents banks, securities firms and other companies,
said in a Nov. 12 comment letter to the CFTC and the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it does not believe there is a
requirement in the law for regulators to impose aggregate
ownership limits.  ‘Beyond What is Necessary’  The proposed regulations “go beyond what is necessary to
effectively mitigate conflicts of interest, and would have the
effects of limiting access to necessary capital and stifling
innovation,” the association said in the letter.  Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, intends to register
as a swap execution facility,  Ben Macdonald , global head of
fixed income at Bloomberg LP, said in a Nov. 17 comment letter
to the CFTC on the proposed regulation. The Bloomberg LP letter
doesn’t comment specifically about the proposed ownership limits
for clearinghouses.  The seven forged public comment letters identified by
Bloomberg News oppose the second part of the proposal.  To contact the reporters on this story: Silla Brush in
