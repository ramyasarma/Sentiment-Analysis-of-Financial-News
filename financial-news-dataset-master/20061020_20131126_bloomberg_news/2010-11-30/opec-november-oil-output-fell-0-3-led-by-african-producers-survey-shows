The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’  crude-oil output fell in November, led by
Nigeria, where attacks by armed groups are reducing production,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production slipped 80,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an
average 29.05 million barrels a day, according to the survey of
oil companies, producers and analysts. October output was
revised higher by 120,000 barrels. Production by members with
quotas, all except Iraq, dropped 80,000 barrels to 26.7 million,
1.855 million above their target.  “The Nigerian production numbers aren’t a surprise, given
the fact that tensions are rising and rebels have had some
success in attacking pipelines and terminals,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy, a
Stamford, Connecticut-based broker.  Nigeria’s production slipped 30,000 barrels a day to 2.12
million, the first decrease since August, according to the
survey. It was the largest reduction of any member. Africa’s
biggest producer exceeded its quota by 447,000 barrels, the most
in OPEC.  The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta
attacked an offshore platform operated by  Exxon Mobil Corp.  on
Nov. 14. Nigerian troops raided camps on Nov. 17 and freed
hostages seized at the Exxon Mobil and  Afren Plc  facilities. The
army arrested militants it said were responsible.  Militant Offensive  Attacks in the southern  Niger River  delta, home to the
country’s oil and gas industry, cut more than 28 percent of
Nigeria’s oil exports between 2006 and 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A recent surge of attacks, following a
period of relative calm after thousands of fighters disarmed
under a government amnesty plan, has drawn a military crackdown.  Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude for loading in December and
January will be affected by a force majeure declared by Royal
Dutch Shell Plc on Nov. 19 after a pipeline leak, a company
spokesman said on Nov. 23. Bonny Light is a low-sulfur grade
prized by refiners because of the proportion of high-value
gasoline it yields.  Force majeure is a legal clause that allows producers to
miss export obligations because of circumstances beyond their
control.  “If this were a time of year when U.S. refiners were
clamoring for Bonny Light, there would have been a stronger
market reaction,” Armstrong said.  Crude oil for January delivery declined $1.62, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $84.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures have increased 6 percent this year.  Angola and Nigeria  Angola and  Venezuela , which reduced production by 20,000
barrels this month, were tied for the second-biggest decline.
Angolan output averaged 1.73 million barrels a day in November,
213,000 barrels above its target. Venezuela pumped an average
2.18 million, the least since June, and 194,000 barrels above
the country’s quota.  Libya, Iran and Algeria bolstered production by 10,000
barrels each in November, the only increases in OPEC. Libya
pumped 1.575 million barrels, the highest level since January
2009, and 106,000 barrels in excess of its target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
