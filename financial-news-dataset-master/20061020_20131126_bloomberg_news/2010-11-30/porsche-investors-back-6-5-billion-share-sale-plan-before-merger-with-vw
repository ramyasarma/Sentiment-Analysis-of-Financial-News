Porsche SE investors approved a
share sale of 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) that the sports-car
maker is seeking to reduce debt before merging with Volkswagen
AG.  Of preferred shareholders voting at Porsche’s annual
meeting today, 88 percent supported the measure, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based carmaker said. Holders of common stock, controlled
by the Piech and Porsche families, unanimously backed the
measure. Porsche needed at least 75 percent approval from both
share classes for the increase to pass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
