Umeme Ltd. , a Ugandan power
distributor owned by Actis LLP’s Infrastructure 2 Fund, will
invest $32 million next year to improve substations, boost new
connections and set up prepayment systems, it said.  The company has invested $96 million in expanding and
refurbishing the nation’s electricity network since winning the
concession in March 2005, it said in a statement published in
the Kampala-based Daily Monitor newspaper today. That’s 47
percent more than the $65 million the company was required to
invest by March 1, 2010, according to its concession terms.  Umeme holds a 20-year distribution concession in the East
African nation until 2025. CDC Group Plc, an investor in
developing countries owned by the U.K. government, is the
 largest investor  in the Actis fund that owns  Umeme .  To contact the reporter on this story:
