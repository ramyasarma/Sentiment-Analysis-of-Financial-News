Aberdeen Asset Management Plc , the
U.K.’s biggest independent fund manager, said it probably won’t
bid for rival  Gartmore Group Ltd.  as it reported 2010 pretax
profit that more than doubled, beating analysts’ estimates.  “We’re extremely unlikely to be buying Gartmore,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Gilbert said today on a conference
call with reporters. “Gartmore’s strong preference is to keep
the business intact and probably merge with someone smaller
than us.”  Profit before tax and exceptional items was 210 million
pounds ($326 million) for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, compared
with 85.1 million pounds a year earlier, the Aberdeen, Scotland-
based firm said earlier today in a statement. That beat the
190 million-pound median estimate of 14 analysts  surveyed 
by Bloomberg.  Gilbert, who founded the company in 1983, has made at least
eight acquisitions in the past five years by purchasing assets
and fund managers from banks undergoing restructuring amid the
credit crisis. The firm has risen 31 percent since the beginning
of September as investors speculated it may begin to profit from
those purchases.  Gartmore has dropped 52 percent since its initial public
offering in December last year after two of its star fund
managers quit, forcing Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Meyer  to
put the firm up for sale. Fellow fund manager Schroders Plc has
also ruled itself out of the bidding.  Star Fund Managers  “The model doesn’t really fit our structure,” Gilbert said.
“We have a more team-based approach. They’re more the star fund
manager approach. It’s more akin to Jupiter or Henderson than
us,” he said, referring to rivals Jupiter Fund Management Plc
and Henderson Group Plc.  Aberdeen’s assets under management climbed 22 percent to
178.7 billion pounds, helped by the acquisition of Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s fund-management business in January. The
 MSCI World Index  gained 2.4 percent to 1111.52 points in the
year to Sept. 30.  Aberdeen climbed 2.2 pence, or 1.2 percent, to 181.2 pence
at 8:06 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about 2.1
billion pounds.  Net income was 92.6 million pounds in fiscal 2010, compared
with a loss of 8.1 million pounds in 2009. The firm raised its
final dividend to 3.8 pence a share, bringing the total payout
for the year to 7 pence from 6 pence last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
