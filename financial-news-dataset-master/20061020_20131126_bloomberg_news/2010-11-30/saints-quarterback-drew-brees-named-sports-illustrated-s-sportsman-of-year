New Orleans Saints quarterback  Drew Brees  was named Sports Illustrated’s  Sportsman of the Year  after
leading his team to its first Super Bowl title and helping the
city rebound from Hurricane Katrina.  Brees, coming off of a shoulder injury, joined the Saints
for the 2006 National Football League season one year after the
hurricane destroyed much of New Orleans. From 2006 through 2009,
he threw for 18,298 yards, the most in the NFL, culminating with
a 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts last February in the
Super Bowl.  Off the field, the  Brees Dream Foundation , established in
2003 to support cancer research and the education of needy
children, has raised more than $2 million, according to Sports
Illustrated.  “Drew’s accomplishments go far beyond delivering a Super
Bowl title to a notoriously long-suffering franchise,”  Terry McDonell , group editor for Sports Illustrated, said in a
statement. “He has been a driving force in a battered city’s
ongoing efforts to rebuild and renew while simultaneously
resurrecting his own career.”  New York Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  was last year’s
winner. Other selections since Sports Illustrated began
publishing in 1954 include Roger Bannister, the first recipient
after breaking the four-minute mile barrier;  Muhammad Ali 
(1974);  Sandy Koufax  (1965);  Michael Jordan  (1991); and  Tiger Woods , the only two-time winner (1996 and 2000).  To contact the reporter on this story:
