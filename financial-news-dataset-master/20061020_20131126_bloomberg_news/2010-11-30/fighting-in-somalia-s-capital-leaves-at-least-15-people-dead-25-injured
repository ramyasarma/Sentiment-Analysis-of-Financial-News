At least 15 people died and 25 were
injured in fighting in  Somalia’s  capital, Mogadishu, that began
late yesterday and continued this morning, said Ali Muse Sheikh,
head of the city’s ambulance service.  Clashes erupted after Islamist fighters attacked government
positions in the north of city late yesterday, Colonel Farah Ali
Mohamed, a government security officer, said in a phone
interview today. A separate battle broke out in the south of the
city earlier today and involved mortar fire, he said.  “Our staff has collected eight corpses and 25 wounded
people from late last night until this morning,” Muse said.
“Almost all the casualties sustained shrapnel wounds. The
victims included women and children.”  Seven of the people admitted to Mogadishu’s main Medina
Hospital died from their injuries, said Marian Abdullahi, a
nurse at the facility.  Rebel fighters from groups including al-Shabaab, the
militia that the U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda, have
been fighting the Somali government for the past three years.
Most of southern and central Somalia has been seized by the
rebels, while President  Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’ s government
controls only parts of Mogadishu.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
