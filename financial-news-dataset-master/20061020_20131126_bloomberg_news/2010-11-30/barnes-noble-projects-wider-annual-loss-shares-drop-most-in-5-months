Barnes & Noble Inc. , the largest
U.S. bookstore chain, forecast a wider loss for the year,
sending the shares down the most in five months.  The loss for the year will be as much as $1.15, the New
York-based company said in a statement today. In August, the
company forecast a loss of up to 65 cents. The stock fell as
much as 17 percent.  The book chain, led by Chief Executive Officer  William J. Lynch  Jr., is investing in e-readers as more customers switch to
reading on devices like  Amazon.com Inc.’s  Kindle. Last quarter,
the retailer released a color version of its Nook e-reader.  The company also said today that it’s still completing a
review of its strategic options, including a potential sale.
There’s no guarantee a transaction will occur, the company said.  Barnes & Noble declined $1.43, or 9.6 percent, to $13.44 at
9:40 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
stock earlier sank as low as $12.27, the largest intraday
decline since June 29.  The net loss narrowed to $12.6 million, or 22 cents a share
in the quarter ended Oct. 30, from $24 million, or 43 cents, a
year earlier, Barnes & Noble said. Earnings this quarter will be
90 cents to $1.20, the bookseller said. Analysts project $1.24 a
share, the average of five  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
