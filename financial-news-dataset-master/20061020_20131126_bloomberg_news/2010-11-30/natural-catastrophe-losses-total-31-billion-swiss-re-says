The cost to insurers of natural
disasters rose to about $31 billion in the first 11 months of
this year after earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand and winter
storm Xynthia in Europe,  Swiss Reinsurance Co.  said.  “Despite notably higher than average earthquake losses,
overall claims in 2010 were in line with the 20-year average due
to unusually modest U.S. hurricane losses,” the Zurich-based
reinsurer said today in an e-mailed statement. Insured natural-
catastrophe losses in 2009 totaled $22.7 billion, Swiss Re said.  Insured losses from February’s 8.8-magnitude quake in Chile
are estimated at  $8 billion , making it the costliest disaster in
2010, according to the world’s second-biggest reinsurer.
Xynthia, which struck at the end of the same month, may cost
insurers $2.85 billion while September’s earthquake in New
Zealand cost $2.68 billion, Swiss Re said.  Man-made disasters triggered additional losses of about $5
billion, including $1 billion of property claims from the
Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, Swiss Re
said. Insured losses from natural catastrophes this year were 30
percent less than the $44 billion reported in 2008, when claims
were boosted by hurricanes Ike and Gustav.  Insured losses from the deadliest event this year, the
earthquake that killed 222,570 people in Haiti, were minimal,
Swiss Re said. The total economic cost of natural disasters more
than tripled to $222 billion while the 260,000 people who lost
their lives was the highest number since 1976.  “While most of the costliest events caused by the
earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand and the winter storm in
Western Europe were covered by insurance, events like the
earthquake in Haiti and floods in Asia were barely insured,”
 Thomas Hess , chief economist of Swiss Re, said in the statement.  The total cost of natural catastrophes this year may
increase further because of the ongoing European winter storm
season, Swiss Re said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
