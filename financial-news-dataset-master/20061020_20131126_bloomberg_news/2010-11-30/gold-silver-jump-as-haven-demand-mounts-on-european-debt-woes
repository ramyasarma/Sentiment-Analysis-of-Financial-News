Gold futures rose to a two-week high
as Europe’s escalating debt woes boosted demand for precious
metals as a haven asset. Silver jumped 3.7 percent, capping the
biggest monthly gain since May 2009.  The dollar climbed to a 10-week high against the euro.
Investor concern has shifted to burgeoning debt in Spain and
Portugal after European governments bailed out Ireland and
Greece. This year, gold is up 26 percent, reaching a record
$1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9, and silver has surged 67 percent.  “Gold is moving higher predominantly on the continued fear
of debt contagion in Europe,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  Gold futures for February delivery rose $18.60, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $1,386.10 an ounce at 1:33 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Nov. 23.  Earlier, the metal reached $1,391.10, the highest since
Nov. 12. In November, the price rose 2.1 percent, the fourth
straight monthly gain.  Silver futures for March delivery jumped $1.019 to $28.212
an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $28.39, the highest since
Nov. 9. The commodity gained 15 percent this month  The most-active contract reached a 30-year high of $29.34
on Nov. 9. This year’s gain is the biggest among 19 raw
materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Investors should continue to hold gold as a hedge against
currency debasement and long-term inflation, Societe Generale SA
said in a report.  ‘Beyond $1,600’  “It’s all on the fear of contagion in Europe,” said
Lannie Cohen, the president of  Capitol Commodity Services Inc. 
in Indianapolis. “That’s going to fuel gold beyond $1,600 in
2011.”  In June, gold priced in euros reached a record as Greece
got a bailout.  “The euro-zone backdrop puts a floor on gold prices,”
said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago.  Lion Fund Management Co. became the first firm to receive
approval from China’s government to invest in overseas exchange-
traded funds backed by gold. China was the second-biggest buyer
of gold in the third quarter, according to the producer-funded
World Gold Council.  “There’s more perceived demand from China since a previous
barrier for entry into the gold market has been lifted,” said
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago.  India was the leading gold buyer last quarter.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $8.15, or 1.2
percent, to $703 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In November, the price gained 9 percent, the fifth straight
monthly increase. The metal, which isn’t a CRB component, has
surged 72 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery advanced $21.80, or
1.3 percent, to $1,666.40 an ounce. In November, the price fell
2.4 percent, ending a two-month rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
