The San Francisco 49ers defeated the
Arizona Cardinals 27-6 as running back  Brian Westbrook  rushed
for 136 yards and a touchdown after an injury to starter  Frank Gore .  Troy Smith  threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to  Michael Crabtree  and rookie  Anthony Dixon  added a 1-yard touchdown run
for the 49ers last night at University of Phoenix Stadium in
Glendale, Arizona.  Although 4-7, the 49ers have won four of their past six
games and are one game out of first place in the National
Football Conference’s West Division. Seattle and St. Louis are
tied atop the four-team division at 5-6.  The Cardinals fell into last place in the division at 3-8
with their sixth straight loss. San Francisco won on the road
for the first time in five games this season.  Gore suffered a first-quarter hip injury for the 49ers and
didn’t return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
