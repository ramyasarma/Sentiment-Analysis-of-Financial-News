The benchmark index for U.S. stock
 options  rose to a two-month high amid concern that European
governments won’t contain the region’s debt crisis.  The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index  is known, rose 9.3 percent to 23.54 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York. It closed above its average price from the past 200 days
for the first time since Oct. 4. The VIX measures the cost of
options used to protect against losses in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index , which fell 0.6 percent to 1,180.55. The volatility
gauge has rebounded after falling to 18.04 on Nov. 19, the
lowest level since April 26.  “We’re seeing this continued momentum picking up in the
euro zone as it kind of feeds on itself and that’s got people
cautious,” said  Dan Deming , a  VIX options  trader at Stutland
Equities LLC on the floor of the CBOE. “There’s been an
increase in seismic activity in the VIX with significant moves
and a definite trend higher. There’s something underneath this
market that’s got a lot of people nervous.”  Stocks fell around the world amid concern the European debt
crisis is worsening. Equities, government bonds and the euro are
being dragged down by concern Portugal and Spain may suffer the
fate of Ireland, which had to ask for an 85 billion-euro ($111
billion) rescue package to help bail out its banks.  In Europe, the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
increased for a third day to close at the highest level since
July. The  VStoxx Index , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, advanced 1.3
percent to 31.07 in Frankfurt. The  Euro Stoxx 50  lost 0.7
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
