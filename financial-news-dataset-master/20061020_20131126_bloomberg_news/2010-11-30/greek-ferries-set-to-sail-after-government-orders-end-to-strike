Domestic ferry services from
Greece’s main port of Piraeus resumed today after the Greek
government directed striking sailors back to work.  The  Pan-Hellenic Seamen’s Federation  began the strike Nov.
23, disrupting services to the Greek islands. After a meeting
this morning, the union decided to return to work although it’s
opposed to the government’s order.  “The Pasok government, unable to find mature solutions to
the serious demands of seamen, took refuge in a deeply
undemocratic and anti-labor measure of political mobilization,”
the union said in an e-mailed statement today, referring to
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s ruling Pasok
Party.  The federation wants to negotiate a collective bargaining
agreement with shipping companies and is seeking wage and
pension guarantees. The walkout has affected deliveries to and
from the hundreds of inhabited Greek islands that rely on ferry
links with the mainland for fresh produce and other goods.  “Some ferries have begun running, but there will be a
delay to the immediate restoration of links to all island
destinations,” an operator of  Piraeus Port ’s ferry
information telephone helpline said today.  Greece’s government last used the emergency order in
August, commandeering trucks and threatening truckers with jail
if they didn’t call off a strike that starved Greek gas stations
of fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
