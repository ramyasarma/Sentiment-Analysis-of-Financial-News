Troy Tulowitzki  signed a contract
extension with the Colorado Rockies that may be worth $134
million over seven years and keep the All-Star shortstop with
the team through the 2020 season.  Tulowitzki, 26, has three seasons left on his current six-
year, $25.75 million deal, MLB.com says. The Rockies will pick
up his option in 2014 and the six-year extension covers the
2015-20 Major League Baseball seasons, the team said in a
 statement  without disclosing financial terms.  Tulowitzki will get $134 million over the final seven
seasons,  MLB.com reported , without saying where it got the
information. It’s the biggest contract offered by the team since
signing first baseman  Todd Helton  to a nine-year, $141 million
extension that began in 2003.  “This deal is huge for me,” Tulowitzki, who helped the
Rockies reach the World Series as a rookie in 2007, said during
a news conference. “I’m really lucky. I can’t wait to be here
for all of my career.”  While Tulowitzki missed six weeks last season with a
fractured left wrist, he still hit .315 with 27 home runs and 95
runs batted in. He was selected to the National League All-Star
team, won a Gold Glove for his defense and finished fifth in the
NL Most Valuable Player voting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
