South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  retreated for a third day, falling 449.84, or 1.5
percent, to 30,266.40 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the mining company that
comprises almost 10 percent of the index, dropped 5.11 rand, or
1.6 percent, to 309.99 rand, a third day of decreases.  BHP
Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s biggest mining company,
declined 2.31 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 250.69 rand. Emerging-
market stocks headed for the biggest monthly retreat since May
on concern Chinese interest-rate increases and Europe’s debt
crisis will slow global growth.  Grand Parade Investments Ltd.  (GPL SJ), the investment
company with interests in tourism and gambling, fell 9 cents, or
3.2 percent, to 2.76 rand, the lowest close since Nov. 15. Grand
Parade said Thuo Gaming Gauteng Ltd. agreed to buy the assets
and contracts from its Playmeter Leisure Services Ltd. unit.  Harmony Gold Mining Co.  (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
producer of the metal, retreated for a fourth day, falling 1.67
rand, or 2.1 percent, to 78.95 rand, the lowest close since Nov.
2. The company was reduced to “underweight” from “equal
weight” at Morgan Stanley.  Life Healthcare Group Holdings Ltd.  (LHC SJ), the operator
of hospitals and healthcare facilities, rose 16 cents, or 1.1
percent, to 14.45 rand, the highest close since Nov. 16. The
company said revenue for the year through September advanced 11
percent to 8.79 billion rand ($1.2 billion) from a year earlier.  Miranda Mineral Holdings Ltd.  (MMH SJ), the South African
minerals explorer, slipped 2 cents, or 2.6 percent, to 75 cents,
the lowest close since Nov. 18. Miranda said its loss for the
year through August widened to 18.8 million rand from 8.8
million rand a year earlier.  Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ), Africa’s largest media company,
retreated for a second day, losing 11.03 rand, or 3 percent, to
354 rand, the lowest since Nov. 17. Profit may be “hit” by the
increasing cost of sport on pay television and increased
spending on business development, the Cape Town-based company
said.  Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, fell 4.81 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 315.30 rand,
the lowest close since Oct. 27. Oil dropped from the highest in
two weeks, with January futures falling as much as 1.3 percent
