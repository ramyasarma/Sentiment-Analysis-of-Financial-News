U.K. next-month natural gas declined
from its highest level since February 2009 as National Grid Plc
forecast increased supply. Power tracked the fuel lower.  National Grid forecast the U.K.’s pipelines will hold 367
million cubic meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, almost 20 million more
than at the start of today. The grid manager  forecast demand 
will rise to 433 million cubic meters by that time, 89 million
more than normal for the time of year.  Gas for December lost 1.8 pence, or 3.3 percent, to 52.85
pence a therm, according to broker data on Bloomberg as of 9:50
a.m in London. That’s equal to $8.21 a million British thermal
units. The contract yesterday rose 3.4 percent. Same-day gas
fell 3.2 percent to 55 pence a therm, erasing yesterday’s gain.  “The markets are retracting from yesterday’s over-reaction
on low temperatures,” Cedric Van Caillie, a risk manager for
Europe at Waregem, Belgium-based Summit Energy, said by e-mail.
“Fundamentally the markets are well-supplied through Norwegian
and liquefied natural gas supply.”  The country used 435 million cubic meters of gas yesterday,
the highest  consumption  since Jan. 13 as freezing weather
boosted demand for the heating fuel.  London temperatures may decline to minus 6 degrees Celsius
(21 degrees Fahrenheit) on Dec. 3 from today’s minus 1 degree,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data. Gas is used to heat about
80 percent of the country’s homes and businesses and is used to
generate about half of Britain’s electricity supply.  U.K. baseload power for the next working day lost 7.25
pounds, or 12 percent, to 53.75 pounds ($83.47) a megawatt-hour.
The contract yesterday advanced to 61 pounds, its highest level
since January 2009, broker data show. Baseload power is
delivered around the clock.  Traders often use near-term prices to gauge future costs.
Power for the first three months of next year lost 2.9 percent
to 47.70 pounds a megawatt-hour. The first-quarter gas contract
declined 3.2 percent to 53 pence a therm.  Bloomberg compiles prices from brokers including ICAP Plc,
GFI Group Inc. and Spectron Group Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
