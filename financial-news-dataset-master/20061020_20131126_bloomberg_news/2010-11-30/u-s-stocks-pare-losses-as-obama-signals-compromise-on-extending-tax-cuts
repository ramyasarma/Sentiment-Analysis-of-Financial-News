U.S. stocks pared losses, helping
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reclaim its third straight
monthly advance, after President  Barack Obama  suggested he’s
willing to compromise with Republicans on extending tax cuts.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent to 1,185.54 at 1:07 p.m. New
York time after losing as much as 1.2 percent.  “The American people did not vote for gridlock,” Obama
said. “There must be some sensible common ground” to resolve
differences on taxes, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
