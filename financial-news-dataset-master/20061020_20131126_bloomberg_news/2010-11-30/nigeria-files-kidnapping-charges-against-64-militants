Nigerian prosecutors have filed
kidnapping and armed-robbery charges against 64 militants
alleged to have attacked an offshore platform operated by  Exxon
Mobil Corp.  on Nov. 14.  The militants, who were read 15 charges each at a
magistrate court in Port Harcourt yesterday, didn’t enter a plea
and were returned to police custody, said Suleiman Abba, police
commissioner in the oil industry hub of Port Harcourt, by phone
today.  Nigerian troops raided militant camps on Nov. 17 and freed
hostages taken in attacks on the facilities of Exxon Mobil and
 Afren Plc , arresting the militants the army said were
responsible. Those freed include two Americans, two Frenchmen,
two Indonesians, a Canadian and 12 Nigerians.  Attacks by armed groups in the southern  Niger River  delta,
home to the country’s oil and gas industry, cut more than 28
percent of Nigeria’s oil exports between 2006 and 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. A recent surge of attacks,
following a period of relative calm after thousands of fighters
disarmed under a government amnesty plan, has drawn a military
crackdown.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
largest source of U.S. oil imports.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Exxon
Mobil, Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures
with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. that pump
most of the West African nation’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
