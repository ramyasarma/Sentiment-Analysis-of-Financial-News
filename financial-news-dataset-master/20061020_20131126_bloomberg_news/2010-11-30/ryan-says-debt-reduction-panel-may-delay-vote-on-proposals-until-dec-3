Representative Paul Ryan, a
Republican member of President Barack Obama’s deficit-cutting
commission, said the panel may delay a vote on its plan and that
it’s unlikely to get enough votes for approval.  “I don’t think there’s 14 and I don’t think I’ll be one
of those 14,” Ryan of Wisconsin said in an interview. The panel
needs agreement from 14 of its 18 members to forward a proposal
to Congress. Ryan said the commission’s co-chairmen are likely
to seek a delay in the vote from tomorrow until Dec. 3 to give
members more time to consider the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
