General Motors Co. , the maker of the
Chevrolet Volt gasoline-electric car, will hire 1,000 engineers
in Michigan to help expand the automakers’ lineup of electric-
drive vehicles.  The hiring will increase GM’s workforce of electric-vehicle
engineers to about 3,000,  Rob Peterson , a company spokesman,
said today at an event to mark the start of production of the
$41,000 car. Detroit-based GM plans to sell 10,000 Volts next
year and 45,000 in 2012.  The Volt, begun under former Chief Executive Officer  Rick Wagoner , is the centerpiece of GM’s effort to position the
company as innovative and environmentally friendly.  Dan Akerson ,
who took over as CEO in September, has said he wants GM to be
“at the forefront” of electric-car development.  “GM is going to lead the industry in the adoption of
various vehicle-electrification technologies,” Akerson said
today in a statement. “We want to give our customers energy
choices other than petroleum and to make the automobile part of
the solution when it comes to the environment.”  GM rose 40 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $34.20 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
gained 3.6 percent from their $33 sale price in an initial
public offering earlier this month.  Volt Requests  More than 200,000 people have requested more information
about the Volt, said John Hughes, the car’s marketing manager.  GM could raise output by 25 percent to 50 percent of the
Volt’s 10,000-unit plan for 2011 if demand increases, said  Tom Stephens , vice chairman of global product operations. Limited
capacity for batteries and other key components would restrict
GM from increasing much more, he said in an interview.  GM is auctioning off the first for-sale Volt and donating
the proceeds to Detroit’s public schools system. The high bid as
of 5:11 p.m. was $105,000, according to a website GM set up for
the auction.  The Volt can drive for 35 miles solely on electric power
and an additional 340 miles on the gasoline engine, GM said
today in a statement.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated the
Volt’s energy use as the equivalent of 93 miles per gallon in
electric-only mode and 60 mpg in gasoline-electric driving, GM
said. In gasoline-only mode, when the battery is drained, the
car would get 37 mpg, GM said.  Chrysler Group LLC is hiring 1,000 engineers and high-tech
workers for its small and midsize vehicles, Mike Palese, a
company spokesman, said today.  About 40 percent of those workers will be contract
employees, he said in an e-mail. The Wall Street Journal
reported Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler’s hirings earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
