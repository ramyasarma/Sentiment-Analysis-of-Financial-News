     Nov. 30 (Bloomberg) ---  Shaftesbury Plc , the owner of more
than 500 shops, restaurants and offices in central London,
reported its first full-year profit in three years and said
Chief Executive Officer  Jonathan Lane  will retire in 2011.
      Net income  in the 12 months through September was 167.1
million pounds ($260 million) compared with a loss of 58.4
million pounds the previous year, the London-based company said
in a statement today. Profit excluding a 183.6 million-pound
gain in property values increased 4.7 percent to 22.1 million
pounds, or 9.7 pence a share.  Most of Shaftesbury’s tenants skirted the recession after
the weak pound lifted the number of high-spending tourists
visiting the West End. Sales at stores on Bond, Oxford and
Regent streets rose  7.7 percent  in October from a year earlier,
bolstering rents and property in the area.  Net asset value was “a little below our expectations”
after other companies with exposure to the West End reported
higher values, said  Miranda Cockburn , an analyst at Matrix Group
Ltd. with an “add” rating on the shares.  Net asset value , excluding changes in the value of fixed-
income derivative investments and deferred tax, advanced almost
24 percent to 414 pence a share, the company said. Cockburn was
expecting 419 pence a share.  Second-Best Performer  Shaftesbury  fell 6 pence, or 1.4 percent, to 435 pence in
London trading, reducing the company’s market value to 988
million pounds. The shares rose about 22 percent in the 12
months through Nov. 26, the second-best performance of the 16
members of the  FTSE All-Share Real Estate Investment Trust Index .
It trailed behind Great Portland Estates Plc.  Lane, 65, has been CEO since founding the company in 1986.
Shaftesbury said it has started the search for a successor. He
will stay on the company’s board as deputy chairman.  Net rental income rose 5.7 percent to 57.6 million pounds
as the company made acquisitions, reduced its vacancy rate and
started to raise rents.  Shaftesbury plans to pay a second-half dividend of 5.25
pence a share, taking the total for the year to 10.25 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
