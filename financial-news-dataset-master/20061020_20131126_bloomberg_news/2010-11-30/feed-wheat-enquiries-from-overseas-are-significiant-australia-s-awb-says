AWB Ltd., Australia’s largest wheat
exporter, said it was receiving “significant” inquiry for feed
wheat for delivery into Asia and Pacific markets.  “The 2010 drought in Russia and Ukraine has limited that
region’s supply potential, current record U.S. ethanol
production is absorbing U.S. corn and with the outlook for
rising demand for coarse grains in China, prices for feed wheat
are holding up well,” AWB General Manager Commodities Mitch
Morison said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
