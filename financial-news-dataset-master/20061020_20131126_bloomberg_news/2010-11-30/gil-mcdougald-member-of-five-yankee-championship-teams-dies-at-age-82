Gil McDougald , the first New York
Yankees player to win the Rookie of the Year award and a member
of five World Series championship teams with the Yankees, has
died of prostate cancer,  the team said .  McDougald, who died two days ago at his home in Wall
Township, New Jersey, was 82. He spent his entire 10-year Major
League Baseball career with the Yankees, from 1951 to 1960, a
period during which New York won eight American League pennants.  McDougald played second base, third base and shortstop, and
was an All-Star in five of his 10 seasons. He had a career
batting average of .276 in 1,336 games, with 112 home runs and
576 runs batted in.  The San Francisco native is survived by his wife, Lucille;
seven children; 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren,
the Yankees said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
