Italy’s Serie A soccer players will
strike Dec. 11-12 over the renewal of contracts, news agency
Ansa reported, citing Leonardo Grosso, the vice president of the
Italian soccer players’ association Assocalciatori.  Negotiations between the players’ group and representatives
of the Italian soccer league broke down today without an
agreement, Ansa said. “The strike by players is an
irresponsible decision,” Serie A President Maurizio was quoted
as saying by Ansa.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
