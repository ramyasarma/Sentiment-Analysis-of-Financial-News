Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho was
banned for two Champions League matches after being found guilty
of improper conduct because he urged two players to get red
cards to clear their disciplinary slate before the next round.  Mourinho, who was fined 40,000 euros ($52,000), will miss
one match, with the other suspension deferred for a probationary
period of three years, UEFA, European soccer’s governing body,
said today on its website.  Players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, who both got
delibrately dismissed from the Nov. 23 match against Ajax, were
fined 20,000 euros, and Iker Casillas and Jerzy Dudek, who
relayed Mourinho’s instructions, were fined 10,000 euros and
5,000 euros, respectively. UEFA’s disciplinary body fined the
soccer club 120,000 euros.  Ramos, a defender, and midfielder Alonso were ejected after
time wasting in the closing minutes of Real’s 4-0 win at the
Amsterdam Arena. They are scheduled to serve a suspension in
Real’s last group game against Auxerre on Dec. 8, which the
Spanish team can afford to lose, before becoming available for
the first knockout round.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
