OAO Gazprom , Russia’s natural-gas
export monopoly, said the South Stream pipeline across the Black
Sea to Europe may cost about 15.5 billion euros ($20 billion).  The offshore part of the link may cost 10 billion euros at
current prices, while the onshore section in Europe may cost 5.5
billion euros, the Moscow-based company said in an excerpt from
its corporate magazine, published today on its website.  Gazprom and  Eni SpA  plan to build a 900-kilometer pipeline
across the Black Sea and extend it to southern and central
Europe to deliver Russian gas, bypassing transit states such as
Ukraine. Russian gas flows to Europe were interrupted at least
twice during freezing weather over the last five years because
of pricing and debt disputes with Ukraine.  An investment decision on the project may be made in mid-
April, Gazprom said.  Gazprom plans to build four lines across the sea, all of
which will bypass Ukraine’s exclusive economic zone, Leonid
Chugunov, head of Gazprom’s project management department, said
in an interview with the corporate magazine.  Bulgaria will probably be the first country to host the
onshore section of South Stream while one or two lines of the
pipeline may reach the neighboring Romanian coast, Chugunov
said. From Bulgaria, the pipeline’s main route will run to
Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria and southern Italy, he said.
Offshoots to Macedonia, Croatia, Hungary, Greece and Turkey may
also be built.  To contact the reporter on this story:
