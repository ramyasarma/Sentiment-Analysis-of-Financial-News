Robert Daniel Soros , son of George
Soros, will invest $50 million in the Hong Kong initial public
offering of  China ZhengTong Auto Services Holdings Ltd. , the
Oriental Daily News said, citing unidentified market sources.  ZhengTong, which plans to raise as much as HK$4.1 billion
($528 million) from the IPO after deducting share-sale fees, is
the second biggest dealer of  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  autos
in China, according to its listing prospectus. The company also
runs sales outlets for brands of other overseas carmakers
including Nissan Motor Co. and General Motors Co., the
prospectus said.  Kelly Fung, of Porda International Finance (Group) Holding
Co., a public relations firm that represents ZhengTong, was not
immediately available to comment on the Oriental Daily report.  China’s surging vehicle demand has been boosting the income
of ZhengTong and other auto dealers and pushing them to expand
their networks. ZhengTong’s revenue rose 64 percent in 2009 from
a year earlier to 4.98 billion yuan ($747 million), according to
the listing document.  The company, which had 22 dealerships by the end of June,
aims to use the share-sale proceeds to more than triple its
number of outlets to 68 by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
