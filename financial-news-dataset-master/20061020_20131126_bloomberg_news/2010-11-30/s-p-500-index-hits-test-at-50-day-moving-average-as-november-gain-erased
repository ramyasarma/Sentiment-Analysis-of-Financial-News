For the second time in two sessions,
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has rebounded after falling
below its average price from the past 50 days, a level watched
by analysts who make forecasts based on chart patterns.  The  stock gauge  dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 1,174.14
earlier, erasing its November gain, amid concern the European
debt crisis is worsening. It  climbed back  above 1,180 as of 4
p.m. New York time. The index dropped 1.3 percent to 1,173.64
yesterday, then reversed most of the slump in the final 90
minutes of trading, closing at 1,187.76.  Should today’s recovery hold it may mean there’s enough
demand to prevent a bigger  selloff , said  Ryan Detrick , senior
technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management, said he’s less
concerned this month’s retreat will worsen compared with the
decline in April and May because five of ten industries in the
S&P 500 are above their 50-day moving average, versus none six
months ago.  “From a technician standpoint, this is encouraging,” said
Detrick in a telephone interview from Cincinnati. “Yesterday’s
 rally  from the lows coupled with today so far does suggest
there’s some buyers down around that level. That’s a heavily
watched trend line.”  Falling Through July  Detrick predicted on May 25 that a retreat in the S&P 500
below its February low of 1,044.50 would send the index toward
1,000. It dropped below that level on June 29 and subsequently
slipped as low as 1,010.91 on July 1.  The S&P 500’s  moving average  for the last 50 days is
1,178.07, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
1,177.31 yesterday, the data show.  The  slump  in April and May, driven by concern some European
nations will be unable to repay their debt, drove the 10 main
S&P 500 industries down to an average of 5.1 percent below their
50-day average. Now, the groups are 1.1 percent above that level
on average, Bloomberg data show.  The  S&P 500  is 15 percent above this year’s low on July 2
after companies reported higher-than-estimated profit and the
Federal Reserve’s plan to increase asset purchases lifted stock
prices. To some technical analysts, who base investment
decisions on price and volume charts, a close below the 50-day
moving average may signal a lasting retreat.  ‘Much Better’  “This is a much  better selloff  for the U.S. than the April
and May selloff,” said New York-based Shaoul, who helps oversee
$1 billion and whose flagship fund beat 89 percent of peers over
the past year. “This selloff is quite selective.”  The S&P 500 lost 13 percent in May and June, its biggest
retreat since the bull market began in March 2009. The equity
 benchmark  closed below its 50-day moving in the beginning of May
and didn’t move above it until the mid-July.  While a decline below the 50-day moving average would
accelerate losses, it may also bring an earlier end to the
selloff, said  Ralph Acampora , a technical analyst at Geneva-
based Altaira Wealth Management.  “Right now you had a very mild short-term correction,”
Acampora said in an interview from New York. “You have a little
bit of a floor below it. If we were to break through it to the
downside, it would extend the correction. If it did break down,
it would probably create a bit of a down draft and that would
probably end the correction.”  The 200-day average for the stock index is increasing and
remains below the 50-day measure, which is reason to doubt that
stocks will keep falling, according to  Christopher Verrone , a
technical analyst at New York-based Strategas Research Partners.  The gauge has fallen 3.7 percent after rising to a two-year
high on Nov. 5 on speculation China will raise interest rates to
tame inflation and concern the sovereign-debt crisis will spread
to southern Europe. The S&P 500 hasn’t closed below its 200-day
moving average, now at 1,133.73, since Sept. 10.  “I’m not too concerned,” Verrone said. “The continuation
of this correction seems pretty shallow.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
