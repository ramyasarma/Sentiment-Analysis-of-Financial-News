China Gas Holdings Ltd. , the energy
supplier to mainland homes and businesses, fell the most in more
than two years in Hong Kong trading after first-half profit
missed estimates and the stock was downgraded by two brokerages.  The  shares  dropped as much as 21 percent, the most since
Sept. 18, 2008, and were down 13 percent at HK$3.88 at 10:14 a.m.
local time. The benchmark Hang Seng index declined 0.1 percent.  China Gas posted net income of HK$93 million ($12 million)
in the six months to September, compared with a median estimate
of HK$301 million in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts. The
stock was downgraded today to “Neutral” at Credit Suisse Group
AG and “Hold” at Mirae Asset Securities HK Ltd.  “Profit was below our expectation and market consensus
estimates,”  Ricky Ng , an analyst at Mire Asset Securities,
wrote in a research note. “Natural gas volume sales growth and
margins in the LPG business were lower than our estimates.”  The energy supplier runs 140 city piped-gas projects in
China, 102 gas filling stations for vehicles and 44 liquefied
petroleum gas distribution projects, according to yesterday’s
earnings  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
