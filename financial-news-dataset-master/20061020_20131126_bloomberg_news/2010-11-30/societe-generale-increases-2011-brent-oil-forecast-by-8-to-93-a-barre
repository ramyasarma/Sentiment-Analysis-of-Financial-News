Societe Generale SA  raised its crude
oil price forecast for next year to $93 a barrel from $85 on
consumption gains and increased investor interest.  Brent crude oil traded on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange will average $90 in the first quarter of 2011,
$92.50 in the second and $95 in the last two,  Michael Wittner ,
the bank’s New York-based head of oil market research, said in a
report today.  West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade deliverable against
the New York futures contract, will trade at a 50 cent discount
to Brent next year because of a “structural oversupply
situation in the U.S. Midcontinent,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
