Oil options volatility gained as the
underlying crude futures fell, following heating oil lower, as
concern the European Union may have to bail out more member
states pushed the euro to the lowest level in 10 weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.1 percent as of 4:00 p.m. in New
York, up from 29.5 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for January delivery dropped $1.62, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $84.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices rose 3.3 percent this month, the third
consecutive increase, and are up 6 percent this year.  Heating oil for December delivery dropped 4.12 cents, or
1.7 percent, to expire at $2.3169 a gallon on the Nymex. Futures
gained 4.4 percent in November and have risen 9.3 percent so far
this year.  January $75 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today with 2,101 lots changing hands. They added 7 cents
to 17 cents a barrel. January $80 puts, the next-most active
contract, climbed 39 cents to 85 cents a barrel with 2,051
contracts trading.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  January $90 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday with 8,165 lots changing hands. They advanced 26 cents
to 59 cents. January $80 puts, the next-most-active option, fell
43 cents to 46 cents with 7,743 contracts traded.  Open interest  was highest yesterday for December 2011 $100
calls with 45,871 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls
with 31,786 and December 2012 $100 calls at 27,711 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
