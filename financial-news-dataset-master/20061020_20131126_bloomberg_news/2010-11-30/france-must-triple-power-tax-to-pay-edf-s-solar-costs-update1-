A French tax on electricity must be
almost tripled next year to pay for a seven-fold increase in
subsidies for solar energy paid for by  Electricite de France SA ,
according to the energy watchdog.  The tax should increase to 12.90 euros ($16.80) a megawatt-
hour from the current 4.50 euros to pay for an increase in the
cost of renewable power, mostly solar, France’s CRE regulator
said in  documents  published today. The cost of solar power for
state-controlled utilities is projected to rise to 915 million
euros next year from 128 million euros in 2010.  A 2011 budget law being debated in parliament would raise
the tax to 7.50 euros a megawatt hour. The tax has been
“insufficient” since 2009 and has led to a shortfall for EDF,
according to the regulator. The shortfall was 1.4 billion euros
last year and is estimated to exceed 1 billion euros this year.  Solar energy costs for EDF have come under increasing
scrutiny as capacity has expanded while subsidized rates for
power have remained relatively high. The government cut the so-
called feed-in tariff for solar power on Sept. 1 for a second
time since January to counter what it called a speculative
bubble in the industry. A planned solar-policy overhaul, to come
as soon as this week, may include an annual capacity growth cap
of 500 megawatts, the government has said.  Cutting Prices  Feed-in tariffs require utilities to buy electricity from
renewable sources at more than the standard rate. EDF, France’s
former power monopoly, pays more for solar power than for the
nuclear power it produces at 58 reactors and what it can buy on
European spot electricity markets. The added cost is passed on
to consumers through the tax.  The government is preparing to cut the price EDF pays for
solar energy about 10 percent and cap the annual volume of
installations, Les Echos reported today, citing people it didn’t
identify.  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA, which is developing solar and
wind energy in France,  dropped  as much as 2.8 percent to 28.46
euros and was trading at 28.62 euros at 4:02 p.m. in Paris. The
shares have dropped 21 percent since the start of the year.  A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Francois Fillon said a
meeting on solar energy is planned for Dec. 2. She declined to
say whether there will be a further drop in solar prices.  The regulator estimates that EDF will pay an average of 546
euros a megawatt-hour for solar power in 2011. This compares
with estimated spot market power prices of 55 euros.  Solar Capacity  The tax is supposed to cover the cost to state utilities
for solar, wind and other renewable energies as well as
subsidies for power to needy households and rural zones.  The total costs will rise to an estimated 3.5 billion euros
in 2011 compared with 2.2 billion euros last year, the regulator
said. The costs of solar power will make up 26 percent of the
total next year, compared with 2 percent in 2009.  France will have 860 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity
installed and connected to the grid at the end of 2010 and a
total of 2,150 megawatts by the end of next year, according to
the regulator. This estimate takes into account the fact that
more capacity is in the pipeline than EDF’s power distributor
 ERDF  can connect.  A government report in September on solar costs and the
stipulations in the 2011 budget law are the first positive steps
towards reducing the impact on EDF’s debt, the company said in a
Nov. 15 earnings presentation.  Reducing Subsidies  A proposed tax increase of 7.50 euros a megawatt hour, as
planned in a draft law before parliament, is lower than the 9.30
needed to cover 2011 costs and the 12.90 required to pay EDF’s
past solar shortfall, the regulator said today.  The government needs to revise solar targets and further
cut subsidies to curb costs to consumers that may balloon to a
cumulative 54 billion euros by 2020, according to the  report ,
written for the government by economist  Jean-Michel Charpin .  New installations should be capped at 300 to 500 megawatts
a year, Charpin wrote. France is on track to surpass its 2020
target for installed solar capacity by 2013 as companies rush to
profit from inflated tariffs, he said.  Companies rushed to install  solar power  as tariff increases
became automatic under a 2006 law and as installation costs
declined, according to Charpin. Returns were as high as 26
percent in the sunniest parts of France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
