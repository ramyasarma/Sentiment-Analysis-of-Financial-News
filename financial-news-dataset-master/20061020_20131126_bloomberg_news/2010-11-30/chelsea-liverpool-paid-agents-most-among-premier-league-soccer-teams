Chelsea and Liverpool soccer clubs
paid more than 9 million pounds ($14 million) in agents’ fees,
the most among Premier League teams, official figures show.  Defending league champion Chelsea paid agents almost 9.3
million pounds from Oct. 1, 2009, to Sept. 30, 2010, while
Liverpool spent just over 9 million, the Premier League said in
a statement.  The league’s 20 clubs paid a total of 67.1 million pounds
to agents for 742 player transactions that included trades,
loans and contract extensions. The figures were published by the
Premier League as part of its drive to improve transparency
about how the game is run.  Manchester City is third on the list at 5.9 million pounds,
down from a league-high 12.9 million pounds the previous year.
Tottenham at almost 5.4 million pounds and Sunderland at 4.4
million pounds round out the top five clubs.  League leader Manchester United ranked 12th at 2.3 million
pounds. West Bromwich Albion, with 614,195 pounds, and
Blackpool, with 45,000 pounds, were the bottom two on the list
after earning promotion last season from the second-division
Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
