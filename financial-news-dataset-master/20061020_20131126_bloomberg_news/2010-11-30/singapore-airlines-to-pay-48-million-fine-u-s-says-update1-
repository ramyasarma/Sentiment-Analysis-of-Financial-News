Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd. 
agreed to plead guilty and pay a $48 million criminal fine for
its role in a conspiracy to fix prices, the U.S. Justice
Department said.  The department filed a one-count felony charge in federal
court today accusing the company of helping fix prices between
2002 and 2006, the Justice Department said in an e-mailed
statement.  The plea deal, which requires court approval, is the latest
in the department’s ongoing investigation into the air-cargo
industry. Including today’s events, 20 airlines and 17
executives have been charged and more than $1.7 billion in fines
have been levied.  In a statement, Singapore Airlines Cargo said it has
cooperated with the investigation.  “The company decided to accept the offer after consulting
its legal advisers and carefully weighing its options,”
according to the statement.  Other airlines that have agreed to pay fines in the
investigation are Polar Air Cargo LLC, a unit of Atlas Air
Worldwide Holdings Inc.; Air France-KLM Group; Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd.; SAS Cargo Group A/S and Martinair Holland NV, a
unit of KLM.  To contact the reporters on this story:
