Copper in London declined, set for
the first monthly drop in five, on speculation that China, the
world’s largest consumer, may raise interest rates or increase
the required reserve ratio for banks again to curb inflation.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped as much as 0.5
percent to $8,177 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $8,185 at 12:05 p.m. Shanghai time, heading for a 0.2
percent November loss. Copper for March delivery on the Comex in
New York fell 1 percent to $3.73 a pound.  “Rumors of another China rate hike hit stocks first and
then weighed down commodities,” Wang Ning, an analyst at
Xiangyu Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  China’s stocks fell, sending the benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index toward its first monthly drop since June. It
closed the morning session 3.1 percent lower at 2778.866.  China may see inflation quicken again this month, after
rising food costs drove prices higher in October, making it
“almost certain” that inflation will top 3 percent for the
full year, Sheng Songcheng, former head of the central bank’s
Shenyang branch, wrote in a commentary in the official Financial
News daily today.  The central bank should clearly state that it’s shifting to
a “prudent” monetary policy and there is still room for
further increases in reserve requirement ratios for banks, he
said in the commentary. Sheng is head of the central bank
headquarters’ statistics and analysis department, according to a
bank official, declining to be named due to agency rules.  Copper for March delivery in Shanghai declined 1 percent to
61,830 yuan ($9,273) a ton as of the midday break, set for the
first drop in five months.  China Demand  In the Chinese physical market, end-user demand has
declined because spot inventories remain plentiful, while the
discount at which imported metal trades over futures continues
to widen, brokerage MF Global Holdings Ltd. said in a report
yesterday.  Although copper’s fundamental backdrop remains quite
bullish, “we suspect that prices have likely done too much too
quickly, and would not be surprised to see a retest of the
recent lows going into yearend,” senior commodity analyst
 Edward Meir  wrote in the report.  Copper will exceed $11,000 a ton by 2013 because of supply
shortages, researcher GFMS Ltd. said in a note yesterday. The
market may move back into surplus in the first half of 2011 as
economies slow, before returning to a shortage, the note said.  Aluminum in London rose 0.2 percent to $2,274 a ton, zinc
was little changed at $2,075 a ton and lead added 0.3 percent to
$2,195 a ton. Nickel was unchanged at $22,425 a ton, while tin
gained 0.3 percent to $23,975 a ton.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Matthew Oakley, Jarrett Banks.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
