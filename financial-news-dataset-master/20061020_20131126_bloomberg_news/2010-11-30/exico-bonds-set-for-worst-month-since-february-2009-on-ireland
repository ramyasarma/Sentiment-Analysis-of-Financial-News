Mexico’s benchmark peso bonds had
their biggest monthly slide since February 2009 as investors
shun riskier assets on concern the Irish debt crisis may spread
to other European nations.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 gained 61
basis points, or 0.61 percentage point, this month to 6.952
percent at 5 p.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander
SA. That’s the biggest increase in yields since February 2009,
when they rose 87 basis points. The price of the security fell
6.82 centavos to 127.23 centavos per peso.  “Everything is derived from the Ireland situation,” said
 Omar Martin del Campo , the head trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in
Mexico City. “Markets continue to assimilate the negative news.
There is fear that contagion is headed to Portugal, Spain.”  The yield on the Mexican security fell 14 basis points
today.  The euro dropped and European government securities were
dragged down on speculation that Spain and Portugal may need to
ask for a bailout similar to the $111 billion package for
Ireland. The dollar rose 1.1 percent to $1.2983 per euro.  The peso plunged 1.1 percent this month to 12.4877 per
dollar, from 12.3449 on Oct. 29, the first drop since August.
The peso rose 0.1 percent today. So far this year, the peso has
gained 4.8 percent against the dollar.  Record Low  Yields on the benchmark government bond plunged to a record
low of 6.258 percent on Oct. 12. Foreign investors sought higher
yields as the U.S. kept its benchmark interest rate near zero,
and Citigroup Inc. added Mexican government bonds to its World
Government Bond Index in October, drawing Asian investors.  Mexico’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at a
record low 4.5 percent for a 15th-straight meeting on Nov. 26.  Foreign capital inflows to Mexico have moderated recently,
central bank Governor  Agustin Carstens  said yesterday.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in dollar options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.
The bank sold $600 million in dollar options today that can be
exercised in December.  None of the options were exercised today or this month,
only the second month that traders haven’t triggered any since
the options have been available.  The bank is open to increasing the amount of options
auctioned monthly to help curb a gain in the currency as
investors in the U.S. seek higher yields, Carstens said Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
