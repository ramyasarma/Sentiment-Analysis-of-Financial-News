U.S. stocks pared losses after a
gauge of consumer confidence increased more than forecast to a
five-month high, bolstering confidence in the economic recovery.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.6 percent to
1,180.63 at 10:03 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 1.2
percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.5 points, or
0.4 percent, to 11,007.99.  The Conference Board’s confidence index increased to 54.1,
exceeding the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, from a
revised 49.9 in October, figures from the New York-based
research group showed today. Measures of employment and income
expectations improved.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
