Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  sued
 Bank of America Corp. , claiming $150 million on a collateralized
debt obligation.  Lehman is seeking to prevent Bank of America from using
“unenforceable” clauses of the deal to “improperly” change
Lehman’s right to priority payment on the CDO, according to a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.  Seeking money to pay creditors, the bankrupt investment
bank has been using lawsuits and requesting court rulings to
preserve disputed payment rights on derivatives transactions.
The disputes hinge on conflicts between bankruptcy law and the
rules governing swap agreements.  Lehman earlier successfully sued BofA over a lending issue,
demanding the return of $500 million of deposits.  Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based BofA, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment on the new lawsuit.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
