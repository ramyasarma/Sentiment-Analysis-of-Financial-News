Japan will cull about 20,000
chickens at a farm in the western prefecture of Shimane after
the country’s first case of avian influenza since 2009 was
discovered by the government today.  The government has asked the farm operator, which also
raises about 3,300 chicks, not to move the birds out of the area
to contain the disease, Yuji Kawakami at Shimane Prefecture’s
livestock office said today by phone. The owner of the egg-
laying chicken farm in Yasugi city found five dead birds
yesterday, he said.  The government has asked farms within a radius of 10
kilometers from the Yasugi farm not to move birds, according to
the  Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries.  “Preventing the spread of bird flu is important from the
standpoint of crisis management,” Chief Cabinet Secretary
 Yoshito Sengoku  told reporters in Tokyo today.  Japan raised a total of 178 million egg-laying chickens and
107 million broilers as of Feb. 1, 2009, the latest data from
the ministry show. A broiler is a commercial-grade young chicken
typically seven weeks old at the time it is killed, the most
common type of chicken available in supermarkets.  Japan culled about 288,000 pigs, cows and cattle this year
to contain the nation’s first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
since 2000. It is the worst loss Japan’s livestock industry has
ever sustained, according to the ministry. The disease was
discovered in the southern prefecture of Miyazaki in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
