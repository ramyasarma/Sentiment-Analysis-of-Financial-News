U.K.  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly dropped to a four-month low in November as looming
public-spending cuts dented Britons’ outlook for 2011, a report
by GfK NOP Ltd. showed.  The index of sentiment declined 2 points to minus 21, the
research group said in an e-mailed statement in London today.
Economists predicted no change from minus 19 in October,
according to the median of 13 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News
survey . A measure of sentiment on the economy for the coming
year fell 2 points to minus 22.  Britain faces the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II
to tame the record budget deficit, prompting the loss of 330,000
public-sector jobs by April 2015. The Treasury’s fiscal watchdog
yesterday cut its economic growth forecast for 2011 and said the
U.K. faces a  “sluggish” recovery .  The report “is clearly not good news,”  Nick Moon ,
managing director of GfK NOP Social Research, said in the
statement. “What is more worrying in this month’s figures is
that the worst-performing elements of the index are those that
look to the future.”  A gauge of Britons’ views on their personal finances for
the coming 12 months fell 5 points to minus 7, and a measure
covering the last year held at minus 13. An assessment of the
country’s general economic situation in the last 12 months fell
3 points to minus 46.  A gauge on the climate for making major purchases fell 2
points to minus 17. GfK NOP conducted the survey of 1,999 people
from Nov. 5 to Nov. 14.  OBR Forecasts  The Office for Budget Responsibility cut its 2011 growth
forecast for the U.K. to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. The
government watchdog still reduced its forecast for public-sector
job losses from a June estimate of 490,000 and raised its
projection for growth this year to 1.8 percent from 1.2 percent.  The outlook for the economy has divided Bank of England
policy makers, who decided this month to leave their bond
purchase plan at 200 billion pounds ($311 billion) and the key
interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent. One member,  Andrew Sentance , has been calling for higher interest rates since June
to stem inflation, while  Adam Posen  maintained a push for a
second month to boost bond purchases to stoke growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
