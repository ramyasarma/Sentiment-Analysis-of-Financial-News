Hong Kong’s  Environmental Protection
Department  reported “very high” air pollution at three
roadside stations in the city this morning.  The Air Pollution Index was 115 in Central, 103 in Causeway
Bay and 103 in Mong Kok as of 10 a.m., the department said on
its website. Readings at the other 11 stations registered
between 52 and 62.  Readings above 100 trigger a government  warning  for people
with heart or respiratory ailments to reduce physical exertion
in heavily trafficked areas. The Hong Kong government  advises 
against long-term exposure to API levels between 51 and 100. The
average hourly reading for Central for the  month  of November was
107.  To contact the reporter on this story:
