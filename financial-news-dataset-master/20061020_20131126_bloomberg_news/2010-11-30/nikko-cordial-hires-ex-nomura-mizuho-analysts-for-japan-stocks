Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. ’s brokerage unit hired five Japan equity analysts from
rivals  Nomura Holdings Inc. ,  Mizuho Securities Co.  and Macquarie
Group Ltd. and will recruit more by the end of March.  Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., the brokerage unit of Tokyo-
based Sumitomo Mitsui, hired quantitative analyst  Keiichi Ito 
today and Japanese banks analyst  Shinichiro Nakamura  on Nov. 29,
said  Kenichiro Yoshida , the head of Nikko’s equity research
division. Both were from Nomura.  The brokerage plans to boost its stock analysts in Tokyo to
about 30 this fiscal year from 24 now in a bid to fully start
Japan equity coverage in April, said Yoshida, who joined the
company in May from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Sumitomo Mitsui is
expanding the business after buying Nikko and investment banking
operations from  Citigroup Inc.  for $6.5 billion last year.  “Pharmaceuticals, food and chemicals are the industries we
want to start coverage of and hire analysts for,” Yoshida, who
heads the equity research department formed in August, said in
an interview on Nov. 29.  Nikko also hired auto-parts analyst  Takao Oshitari  from
Mizuho on Nov. 1 and construction and real estate analyst
 Junnosuke Shinkawa  from Macquarie Securities Ltd., Yoshida said.
Former Mizuho analyst  Ken Murakoshi , who also joined in November,
will cover mid-sized industrial companies, according to Yoshida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
