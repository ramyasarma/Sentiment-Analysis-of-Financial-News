The Asian Development Bank may
provide loans to a 580-megawatt solar power park in India’s
Gujarat state as the country aims to increase its solar power
capacity to meet growing demand.  The solar power park is being developed in Charanka village
by the Gujarat state government, Naoki Sakai, a senior climate
change official from the bank, said in a Dec. 22 telephone
interview  from Manila, where the lender is located. The project
will use both solar photovoltaic and solar thermal power, he
said.  For solar photovoltaic projects, energy from the sun is
converted directly to electricity, while in solar thermal
projects, the sun’s energy is used to make steam which is then
used to generate power.  “We already provide some portion of technical assistance”
to the project, Sakai said. The bank is exploring the
possibility of providing financial assistance including a loan,
he added.  He declined to say the amount of the loan the bank is
considering, saying that it has not made any decision on
financial assistance.  “The government would like to make this solar park as a
showcase” for various kinds of technology, Sakai said. India
aims to generate 20 gigawatts of solar power by 2022.  The ADB could also provide support for power transmission
in India, he said.  Editors-- Baldave Singh, John Viljoen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
