The rand strengthened 1.8 percent
this week against the dollar as signs of a global economic
recovery prompted some investors to buy the currency to benefit
from South Africa’s yield advantage.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 0.2 percent to 6.7338 per dollar and traded at 6.7468 as
of 1:05 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.7451.  “Long-term growth and inflation expectations are
strengthening,” BNP Paribas said in a note to the market today.
“We stay bullish on the rand in the short term.”  Spending by U.S. consumers increased in November for a
fifth month, showing the biggest part of the economy is
strengthening heading into 2011. Household purchases rose 0.4
percent after a 0.7 percent increase in October that was almost
twice as large as previously estimated, figures from the
Commerce Department showed yesterday. The rand has surged 40
percent since the start of last year as developed nations cut
rates to near zero to pull their economies out of recession,
while South Africa’s  main central bank rate  is still 5.5 percent
after a series of reductions.  “Speculative flows are at a minimum while exporters are
active because the mines don’t stop producing,”  George Glynos ,
managing director of  Econometrix Treasury Management , which
advises South African banks on foreign-exchange transactions,
said by phone from Johannesburg today. The rand may advance to
6.50 versus the dollar in the next six months, Glynos said,
adding that 6 rand to the dollar is “very possible” even as
countries including the U.S. use methods like quantitative
easing to manipulate currencies.  Government bonds snapped two days of declines, with South
Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
adding 5 cents to 123.82 rand. The yield on the bond retreated 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
