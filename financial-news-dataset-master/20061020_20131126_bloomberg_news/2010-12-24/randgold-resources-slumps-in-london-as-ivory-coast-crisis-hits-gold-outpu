Randgold Resources Ltd. , a producer
of the metal in West Africa, sank to an eight-month low in
London trading after saying the political crisis in Ivory Coast
would have a “negative impact” on fourth-quarter performance.  Randgold  fell 235 pence, or 4.3 percent, to 5,265 pence at
12:30 p.m. local time, the lowest closing price since April 27.  Instability in Ivory Coast, caused by conflicting claims to
the presidency, has delayed equipment deliveries to Randgold’s
Tongon mine, affecting output, the company said yesterday in a
statement.  A stand-off between  Laurent Gbagbo , president for a decade,
and  Alassane Ouattara , the United Nations-backed winner of the
Nov. 28 election, has sparked violence in the country. Gbagbo
has the backing of the army after the Constitutional Council
dismissed the vote count in some northern areas, where Ouattara
draws much of his support, and named him as victor.  Randgold said Tongon would produce about 35,000 ounces of
gold this year, down from an earlier forecast of 75,000 ounces.
The Jersey, Channel Islands-based company also cut its output
target for its Loulo mine in Mali to between 80,000 ounces and
85,000 ounces following maintenance to prevent power failures.  Randgold said “the effect of the continuing political
impasse in Cote d’Ivoire on its Tongon mine and a below-target
contribution from its Loulo complex would have a negative impact
on its fourth-quarter performance and its year-end results,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
