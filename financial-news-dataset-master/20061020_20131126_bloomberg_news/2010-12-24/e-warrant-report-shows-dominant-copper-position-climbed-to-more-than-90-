One unidentified company has the
potential to own at least 90 percent of the copper in warehouses
monitored by the London Metal Exchange, the largest such
position in two years, bourse data showed.  The so-called dominant position indicated in the Warrant
Tom Banding Report was previously 80 percent to 89 percent and
last exceeded 90 percent on Nov. 7, 2008, according to the LME.
The report is used by the LME to apply guidelines that oblige
the owner to lend metal at fixed rates. The figure includes
stockpile holdings and futures contracts that expire in the next
two trading days. Ninety percent of the LME stockpiles is worth
about $3.5 billion at today’s price.  The metal, used in everything from car wiring to plumbing,
has climbed 27 percent this year after stockpiles declined.
 Inventories  are heading for the first annual decline since 2004
as mining companies failed to keep pace with demand. Copper has
tripled in two years on demand from China, the largest buyer.  “It’s purely demand for exposure to copper as a commodity
that’s driving the price,” said  Kevin Tuohy , a metals trader at
MF Global U.K. Ltd. in London. As far as the dominant position
is concerned, “the metal is still there, still in the
warehouse. It’s not being consumed or moved out of the
warehouse, so no, not attaching too much importance to it.”  Copper Prices  Copper for delivery in three months rose $30, or 0.3
percent, to $9,330 a metric ton on the LME by 1:18 p.m. in
London. Stockpiles stand at 370,725 tons. One party actually
owns 80 percent to 89 percent of the stockpiles, not counting
open futures positions, as of Dec. 22, according to the
exchange.  A dominant position holder is anyone owning at least 50
percent of LME registered stockpiles. There has been a dominant
owner in copper since Nov. 24.  The fee to borrow copper for one day, also known as the
tom-next spread, jumped to $13 today, the highest since Dec. 14.  One sign of the metal’s scarcity is the premium that can be
charged for metal for immediate delivery as opposed to in three
months, a market condition called backwardation, according to
 Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
That so-called spread was $49 a ton yesterday, according to the
LME. The market has been in backwardation since Nov. 8.  The spread rose to as high as $241 a ton in July 2008 when
copper jumped to a then record $8,940. Copper climbed to an all-
time high of $9,392 on Dec. 21 when the spread was $40.  Total stockpiles will decline over next year as supplies
fall short of demand by 825,000 tons, Barclays Capital said in a
report on Dec. 22. The shortage this year is estimated at
449,000 tons, according to Barclays.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
