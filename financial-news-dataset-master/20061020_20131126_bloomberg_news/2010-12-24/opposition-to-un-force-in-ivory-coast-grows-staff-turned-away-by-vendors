Some vendors in Ivory Coast are
refusing to sell members of the United Nations’
peacekeeping force in the country fuel for their
helicopters and vehicles while staff are being turned away
from food stalls in markets, a spokesman for the force
said.  Sentiment against the 9,105-strong force is growing in
the commercial capital, Abidjan, where  Laurent Gbagbo  has
refused to step down as president after a Nov. 28 vote saw
 Alassane Ouattara  recognized by the UN, the U.S. and
neighboring states as the victor, Amadou Bachirou, a UN
military spokesman, said in an interview from the city
today.  On Dec. 20 the United Nations Security Council
extended the mandate of the mission in Ivory Coast for six
months, defying Gbagbo’s demand that they withdraw. The
force has helped keep the peace in the country since a 2002
civil war divided the nation, the world’s biggest cocoa
producer, into a rebel-held north and a government
controlled south.  The aim of the election was to reunite the country.
Gbagbo has ruled since 2000.  Gangs of youths loyal to Gbagbo yesterday blocked a UN
patrol in Abidjan from passing, accusing members of the
force of being “rebels” and singing the national anthem.  Political violence has left 173 people dead since Dec.
16, when security forces opened fire on Ouattara supporters
as they protested in Abidjan, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
