Copper rose for the first time in
three days in London after stockpiles declined in China, the
world’s largest buyer, amid supply disruptions in Chile.  Copper stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell 5.8 percent this week, the exchange said
on its website today. Prices have climbed 3.2 percent this week
after owners of the Collahausi mine in Chile indicated they may
not be able to supply all customers after a port accident.  “A drawdown in Shanghai inventories and ongoing concerns
over Collahuasi’s main exit route for its concentrates are
keeping copper supported,” said Leon Westgate, a London-based
analyst at Standard Bank Plc.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed $60, or 0.7
percent, to $9,360 a metric ton as of 5:03 p.m. on the London
Metal Exchange. Prices are up 27 percent this year.  China’s copper inventories dropped 7,410 tons to 120,426
tons, based on a survey of seven warehouses in Shanghai, the
Shanghai Futures Exchange said on its website.  Stockpiles  have
declined in four of the past five weeks.  The port at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
venture, the world’s third-largest copper mine, may remain
closed for “a couple of months” after a Dec. 18 accident,
according to  Miguel Angel Duran , head of Anglo American’s
Chilean operations. Owners of Collahuasi on Dec. 20 declared
force majeure, a legal clause that allows companies to miss
deliveries because of circumstances beyond their control.  Collahuasi processes ore into concentrate, an intermediary
product that’s transported by pipeline to the Patache port in
Chile.  Canceled Warrants  Orders  to draw copper from LME stocks, or canceled
warrants, jumped 17 percent to 19,475 tons, according to data
from the exchange today.  The fee to borrow copper for one day, the so-called tom-
next spread, was last at a premium of $13, compared with
yesterday’s closing $2 premium. An increase in the fee may
indicate tightening supply.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME fell 0.3 percent to
$26,800 a ton, lead declined 0.5 percent to $2,437.50 a ton and
zinc rose $1 to $2,299 a ton. Aluminum fell $2 to $2,430 a ton.
Stockpiles of aluminum in Shanghai declined for a second week to
the lowest in more than seven months, losing 3,077 tons to
441,622 tons, based on a survey of 12 warehouses in Shanghai,
Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the exchange said.  Nickel climbed 1.4 percent to $23,921 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
