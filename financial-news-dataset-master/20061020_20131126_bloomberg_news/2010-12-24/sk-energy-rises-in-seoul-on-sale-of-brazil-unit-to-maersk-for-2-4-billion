SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s biggest
oil refiner, rose to the highest in more than three years in
Seoul trading after the company agreed to sell its Brazilian
unit for $2.4 billion.  The  stock  climbed 4.2 percent to 196,500 won at 10:41 a.m.
local time, headed for the highest close since Nov. 7, 2007. The
benchmark Kospi index fell 0.1 percent.  SK Energy said yesterday it agreed to sell its SK do Brasil
Ltda. to  Maersk Oil , a unit of A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, and will
use the proceeds either to invest in producing and developing
oil fields or to purchase overseas oil companies. The unit holds
a 40 percent stake in the Polvo field, a 20 percent share in the
Wahoo discovery and owns 27 percent of the Itaipu field.  “The announcement is a Christmas gift for SK Energy’s
shareholders,”  Kim Jae Jung , an analyst at Woori Investment &
Securities Co., said in a note today. “SK Energy sold the
assets as it would have taken too much time and money to develop
the deepwater fields in Brazil.”  SK Energy holds stakes in 30 oil and gas projects in 16
countries. The company has 500 million barrels of oil reserves
and produces 75,000 barrels of crude a day, according to
yesterday’s statement.  The Polvo field in Brazil currently produces 10,000 barrels
of oil while the other two blocks are under exploration,
according to SK Energy. In its third-quarter earnings statement
on Nov. 15, the South Korean company said the assets of its
Brazilian unit were valued at 511 billion won ($443 million) at
the end of 2009.  Yesterday’s deal shows that SK Energy’s assets have been
undervalued, Cho Seung Yeon, an analyst at HMC Investment
Securities Co., said in a note to clients today. Cho raised his
price estimate for the stock by 27 percent to 280,000 won,
maintaining a “buy” rating.  Separately, SK Energy agreed to sell its coal mining
business to sister company SK Networks Co. for 236.6 billion won
($205 million).  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
