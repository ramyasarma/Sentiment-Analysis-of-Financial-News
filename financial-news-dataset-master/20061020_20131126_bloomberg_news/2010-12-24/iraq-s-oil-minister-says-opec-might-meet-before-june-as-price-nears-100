(Corrects 2011 Iraqi oil output in second paragraph of
story published Dec. 24.)  The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries may meet before its next regularly scheduled
gathering in June, Iraqi Oil Minister  Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi 
said today.  He also said he is “happy” with the current price of oil
and that Iraq’s output in 2011 will be 2.5 million barrels a day.  The minister spoke to reporters in Cairo, where he is
attending tomorrow’s meeting of the  Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries .  Crude oil for February delivery advanced $1.03 to $91.51 a
barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
highest settlement since Oct. 3, 2008. Prices are up 15 percent
this year.  OAPEC , seven of whose members are also part of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was established
in 1968 to foster the development of the petroleum industry in
member states as part of an economic integration plan among Arab
countries.  OPEC, which accounts for 40 percent of global oil supply,
decided at its last meeting in Quito, Ecuador, on Dec. 11 to
maintain its production of  24.845  million-barrel-a-day target,
set in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
