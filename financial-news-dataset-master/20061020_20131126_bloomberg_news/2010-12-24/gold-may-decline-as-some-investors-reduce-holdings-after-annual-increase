Gold rose for the first time in
three days in London as concern about Europe’s debt crisis
spurred investors to protect their wealth.  Fitch Ratings yesterday downgraded Portugal by one level
and said the country’s economy faces a “deteriorating” outlook
as the government struggles to contain the euro region’s fourth-
largest budget deficit. Gold climbed to a record $1,431.25 an
ounce on Dec. 7 amid mounting concern about the fiscal health of
countries including Ireland, Spain and Greece.  “Gold prices have risen largely on the sovereign risk in
Europe,” said  Chris Kwon , a trader at Seoul-based KTB
Securities Co. “Bullion will probably soon break the $1,400
mark again.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose $4.83, or 0.3 percent, to
$1,384.93 an ounce at 12:45 p.m. in London. Gold futures for
February delivery closed at $1,380.50 on the Comex in New York
yesterday. Trading is closed today.  Bullion rose to $1,380.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,373.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Spot
prices advanced 26 percent this year, heading for a 10th
consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak in at least
nine decades.  The euro gained against the dollar after Standard & Poor’s
said yesterday that France deserves an AAA sovereign credit
rating because of the “wealth and depth” of its economy and
the view that President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government will
consolidate its budget gap.  Eleven of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 58 percent, said that the metal will rise next
week. Five predicted lower prices and three were neutral.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 3.12 metric
tons to 2,101.3 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,114.6
tons on Dec. 20.  Silver for immediate delivery in London was little changed
at $29.2725 an ounce. Palladium gained 1.6 percent to $764.25 an
ounce. Platinum was 0.4 percent higher at $1,726.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
