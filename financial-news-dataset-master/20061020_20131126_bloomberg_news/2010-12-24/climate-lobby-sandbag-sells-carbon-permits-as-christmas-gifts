Sandbag , a climate lobby group, is
offering people a way of supporting European Union efforts to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by canceling permits as a
Christmas gift.  The London-based group bought EU carbon permits from St.
Helens and Knowsley NHS Trust, a group of hospitals in northern
England that had a surplus. Sandbag is selling them to
individuals or groups who have no need for them so that they
reduce the number of allowances traded in the market.  “Carbon destruction is the perfect last minute eco-
present,” Michael Buick, Sandbag’s director, said in an e-
mailed statement. “It’s a direct action to reduce pollution in
one of the smartest ways possible and a political call for
change.”  EU carbon permit futures fell to their lowest in almost
five months. Allowances for December 2011 dropped as much as 1.3
percent to 13.90 euros ($18.24) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London, the lowest intraday price since July
27. They were at 14.03 euros as of 10:03 a.m.  Sandbag didn’t specify how many permits they held or how
many tons of carbon dioxide had already been destroyed.  Each permit eliminated from the marketplace theoretically
raises the cost of permits for utilities, businesses and
factories, thus providing an incentive to invest in low-carbon
energy or technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
