Mauritius is targeting foreign
direct investment of 12 billion rupees ($393 million) next year,
up from more than 10 billion rupees in the first nine months of
this year, said Ramaprakash Maunthrooa, managing director of the
country’s Board of Investment.  “We will continue to consolidate our traditional markets
and sectors as well as target new avenues of investment” from
Russia, Egypt, India, China and the Middle East and the Far
East, he said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
