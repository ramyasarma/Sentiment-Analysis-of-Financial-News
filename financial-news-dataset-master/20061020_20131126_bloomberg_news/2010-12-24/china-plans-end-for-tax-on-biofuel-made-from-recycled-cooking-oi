China will end the consumption tax
on producing biodiesel with used edible oil, the Ministry of
Finance said in a statement posted on its website today.  The move, which will decrease the production cost by about
900 yuan per metric ton, can increase biofuel production and
help to prevent restaurants cooking with used oil, the statement
said.  The policy will take effect retroactively from Jan. 1,
2009, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
