Motorists in the western section of
London’s congestion charge zone will no longer be required to
pay for driving in the area from tomorrow.  The removal of the extension, which includes parts of
Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea, may result in 10
percent to 15 percent more daytime traffic entering the area,
London Mayor Boris Johnson  said  in response to questions in the
London Assembly last year.  “The removal of the extension follows a public
consultation on its future that was promised by the Mayor in his
election manifesto, and that saw 62 percent of respondents back
its removal,” the Mayor’s office said in a  statement  on its
website Dec. 22.  London’s congestion charge was introduced in February 2003,
and extended west in 2007. Motorists who drive within its area
of operation currently pay a daily charge of 8 pounds ($12), set
to rise to 10 pounds from January.  London residents living in the extension, who are currently
entitled to a 90 percent discount on the charge, will pay full
price from Jan. 1 onwards if they drive into the central area
which remains in operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
