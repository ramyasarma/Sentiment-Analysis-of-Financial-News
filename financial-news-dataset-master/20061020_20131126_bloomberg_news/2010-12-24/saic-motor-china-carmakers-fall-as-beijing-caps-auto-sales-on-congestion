SAIC Motor Corp., FAW Car Co. and
Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. fell in pre-market trading in
Shanghai and Shenzhen after the city of Beijing introduced
measures to ease congested roads.  SAIC dropped 1.2 percent to 15.81 yuan in Shanghai, while
FAW Car fell 0.4 percent to 16.70 yuan and Changan lost 0.3
percent to 10.30 yuan in Shenzhen.  Beijing, ranked as having the world’s worst traffic, will
limit the number of new passenger vehicles in the Chinese
capital to ease congested roads.  The government will issue a quota of 240,000 new vehicle
license places through a lottery system next year, with about 88
percent allocated to individual buyers, according to a statement
released yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
