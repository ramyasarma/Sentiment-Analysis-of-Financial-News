Mark Sanchez ’s ability to start
against the Chicago Bears will be a “game time-type decision”
after the New York Jets quarterback’s injured shoulder is
evaluated, coach  Rex Ryan  said.  Two days ago, Ryan said Sanchez was recovering well and
that he was “99 percent sure” Sanchez would start against the
Bears. Yesterday, Ryan said he misunderstood the severity of the
second-year quarterback’s injury and that Sanchez may not start.  “He’s got a sore shoulder, there’s no question about it,”
Ryan said.  Sanchez, 24, injured his right shoulder in the first
quarter of the Jets’ 22-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Dec. 19. Sanchez stayed in the game with pain in his shoulder
and has been limited in practice for the past few days.  Sanchez has started 32 of the Jets’ 33 games since being
selected with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. The former
University of Southern California quarterback has completed 54
percent of his passes this season for 3,022 yards and 16
touchdowns. He has thrown 12 interceptions, all in the past nine
games.  The Jets (10-4) can clinch a playoff spot with a win over
the Bears (10-4) this weekend or a victory against the Buffalo
Bills (4-10) on Jan. 2.  If Sanchez cannot start, Ryan said he was very comfortable
with 16-year veteran  Mark Brunell  running the offense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
