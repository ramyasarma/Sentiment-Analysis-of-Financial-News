Kenya’s inflation rate rose to 4.5
percent in December, the highest in 10 months, led by food and
transportation costs, the statistics office said.  Inflation accelerated from 3.8 percent the month before,
the office said in an e-mailed statement from the capital,
Nairobi, today. Transportation costs rose 3.45 percent in the
month, while food and non-alcoholic drinks climbed 1.76 percent,
it said.  Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy, reintroduced fuel
price controls from Dec. 15 after retail prices leaped 12
percent this year, Energy Minister  Kiraitu Murungi  said on Dec.
7. Wholesale profit margins have been capped at 6 shillings (7
U.S. cents) per liter (0.26 gallons) and retail margins at 3
shillings, Murungi said.  Fuel prices rose to 96.2 shillings a liter in September
from 86.2 shillings in January, according to the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics. Oil futures in New York increased by 0.8
percent over the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
