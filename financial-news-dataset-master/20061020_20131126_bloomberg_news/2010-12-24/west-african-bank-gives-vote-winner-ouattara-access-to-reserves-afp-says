The Central Bank of West African
States, or BCEAO, recognized  Alassane Ouattara  as Ivory Coast’s
president, giving him control over state reserves previously
governed by  Laurent Gbagbo , Agence France-Presse reported,
citing a statement by the bank.  The seven finance ministers of the member states backed
Ouattara after the United Nations, the African Union and the
Economic Community of West African States had supported him as
the rightful winner of Nov. 28 elections, the news service
reported late yesterday.  The finance ministers of the West African Monetary Union
decided to “only allow the rightfully appointed representatives
of the legitimate government of Ivory Coast to carry out any
transactions on the accounts that are open in its name,” AFP
cited the statement as saying.  The West African franc, which Ivory Coast uses, is pegged
to the euro in an arrangement with the Bank of France. Gbagbo
has refused to accept defeat in the presidential elections and
has rejected international calls to step down as the leader of
the world’s top cocoa grower.  -- Editors:  Alastair Reed ,  Renee Bonorchis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
