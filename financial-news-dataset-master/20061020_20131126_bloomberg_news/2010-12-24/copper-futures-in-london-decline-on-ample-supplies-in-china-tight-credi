Copper gained, poised for a fourth
weekly advance, as positive U.S. economic data and expectation
of higher Chinese imports boosted the demand outlook.  The metal for three-month delivery erased earlier declines
to gain 0.6 percent to $9,353 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange as of 3:24 p.m. in Shanghai, or 0.4 percent less than
the record $9,392 reached Dec. 21. The bourse will be closed on
Dec. 27 and Dec. 28.  “The uptrend remains intact given favorable data and news
from the U.S.,” Peng Qiang, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co.,
said by phone from Beijing. “The drop on Wednesday and Thursday
was due to profit-taking after the contract hit a record.”  Household purchases in the U.S. rose 0.4 percent after a
0.7 percent increase in October that was almost twice as large
as previously estimated, figures from the Commerce Department
showed yesterday. First-time filings for jobless insurance
declined by 3,000 to 420,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, matching
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, according to
Labor Department figures.  In Chile, the port at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s
Collahuasi venture, the world’s third-largest copper mine, may
remain closed for “a couple of months” after a Dec. 18
accident, Miguel Angel Duran, Anglo’s head of Chilean
operations, told reporters in Santiago yesterday.  Copper may rally to new records as China imports more of
the metal in the first quarter and the launch of exchange-traded
products locks up physical supplies, Yang Changhua, a senior
analyst at metal researcher Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. said Dec. 22.  Shanghai Gains  Copper for March delivery on the Shanghai exchange closed
0.4 percent higher at 68,950 yuan ($10,397).  The Shanghai bourse said yesterday it will allow copper and
aluminum at bonded warehouses to be delivered against futures
contracts, a move expected to facilitate physical flows and
bring Shanghai prices closer to international market levels. Two
warehouses at Yangshan port in Shanghai will provide delivery
services from March 16 next year.  Three-month aluminum in London climbed 1 percent to $2,456
a ton, zinc rose 0.3 percent to $2,305.75 a ton, and lead fell
0.4 percent to $2,440 a ton. Nickel gained 1.5 percent to
$23,960 a ton, and tin dropped 0.7 percent to $26,700.  -- Helen Sun , with assistance from Matt Craze in Santiago.
