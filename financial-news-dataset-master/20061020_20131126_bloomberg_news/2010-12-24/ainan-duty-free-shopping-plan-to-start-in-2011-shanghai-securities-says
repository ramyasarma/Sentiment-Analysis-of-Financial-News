China has approved a duty-free
shopping plan for Hainan province, the Shanghai Securities News
reported, citing unidentified people.  Foreign tourists will be able to get a tax rebate on items
purchased in the province from Jan. 1, 2011 and this will be
available for Chinese consumers at a later date, the newspaper
said today, without elaborating.  Chinese consumers will be able to get their sales tax
returned if they spend no more than 5,000 yuan ($754) each time,
the report said, without giving a figure for foreign travelers.
The tropical island attracted 23 million tourists from both
China and overseas last year, data from Hainan’s provincial
government show.  “The rules are expected to boost the attractiveness of
Hainan, which is already well known as a holiday resort for its
climate,” said  Wang Jianhui , an analyst with Southwest
Securities Co in Beijing.  China’s government has been taking measures to boost the
country’s domestic consumption in a bid to transform the economy
to a more consumer-driven one. The government has outlined a
plan to build Hainan into an international tourism hub, with
revenue from the industry rising to 124 billion yuan by 2020
from 21 billion yuan in 2009.  Chinese tourists have long favored places such as Hong Kong
as a shopping destination because sales tax isn’t levied.
Travelers from mainland China spent HK$83 billion ($10.7 billion)
in the former British colony last year, accounting for 70
percent of spending by all visitors, according to the  Hong Kong
Tourism Board .  Worldwide, the number of Chinese outbound travelers is
expected to hit 54 million in 2010 and they are projected to
spend 48 billion yuan, the China Tourism Academy said in a
report released in April. More than 100 million Chinese will
make overseas trips in 2015 and each of them is forecast to
spend $1,000, according to figures by the think-tank, which is
affiliated to the China National Tourism Administration.  -- Michael Wei . Editors:  Garry Smith ,  Hwee Ann Tan .  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
