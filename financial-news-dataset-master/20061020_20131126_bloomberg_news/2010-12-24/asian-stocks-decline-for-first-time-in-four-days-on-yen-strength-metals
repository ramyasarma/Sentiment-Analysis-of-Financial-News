Asian stocks  declined, driving the
benchmark index to its first drop in four days, as lower metal
prices dragged down mining companies and Japanese exporters fell
after the yen gained yesterday, when Tokyo markets were closed.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 mining company, lost
0.9 percent in Sydney. Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker
that earns about 75 percent of its sales overseas, retreated 1.3
percent in Tokyo. Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of
chip-testing equipment, dropped 1.8 percent in Tokyo after
revising a takeover offer.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co.  plunged
5.7 percent in Seoul after selling new shares at a discount.  “The market seems to be taking a bit of breather today
after a pretty strong month,” said  Matt Riordan , who helps
manage about $7 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment
Management Pty. “The economic data has been looking pretty
reasonable and there’s nothing data-wise or news-wise that’s
particularly negative. There’s probably a bit of profit taking
going on at the end of the calendar year.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 0.2 percent to 135.25 as
of 7:36 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than two stocks declining for
each that advanced. The gauge is set for a 5 percent gain this
month as reports showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded
faster than estimated and the country’s retail sales increased
last week, bolstering confidence in a global economic recovery.  Indexes Retreat  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.7 percent after
being closed yesterday for a holiday. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index decreased 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index dipped
0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.3 percent, led
by Chinese automakers on concern government curbs will car
sales. China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7 percent.  Markets in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore shut early
for Christmas Eve.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  advanced 13 percent this year
through yesterday on speculation that growth in corporate
profits will weather Europe’s debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb
property-price inflation and concern about the pace of the U.S.
economic rebound. That matches the gain by the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in the U.S. and beats the 11 percent increase by the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Asian benchmark plunged 43 percent in 2008 and
rebounded 34 percent last year, its biggest gain since 2003.  Stocks in the MSCI index were valued at 14.8 times
 estimated earnings  on average at yesterday’s close, compared
with 14.7 times for the S&P 500 and 12.5 times for the Stoxx
600.  Metal Prices, Currency  Material-related and consumer companies  dropped the most 
today among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. BHP Billiton fell 0.9 percent to A$46.04 in Sydney. Rio
Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest mining company, declined
1 percent to A$86.36.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent
yesterday in New York. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six
metals including copper and aluminum slipped 0.8 percent
yesterday, dropping for a second consecutive day.  Nissan lost 1.3 percent to 785 yen in Tokyo. Mazda Motor
Corp., with about 24 percent of sales in North America and 17
percent in Europe, sank 2.5 percent to 239 yen.  The dollar depreciated to as low as 82.86 against the yen
yesterday in New York, the weakest level since Dec. 14. The euro
slid to as low as 108.46 against the Japanese currency
yesterday, near the lowest level this month. That cuts the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency.  ‘Lock in Profits’  “The stronger yen will likely lead investors to sell
shares to lock in profits,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.  Advantest  dropped 1.8 percent to 1,853 yen after Verigy
Ltd., a maker of testing equipment for semiconductor
manufacturers, said Advantest raised its takeover offer by 23
percent. Advantest said it amended its offer, without providing
details.  In Seoul, Hyundai Merchant Marine plunged 5.7 percent to
37,150 won. Hyundai Elevator Co. agreed to buy 1.8 million new
shares in the shipping line for 32,000 won each, according to a
regulatory filing.  Dongfeng Motor Group Co., the Chinese partner of Nissan,
tumbled 7.9 percent to HK$13.08 in Hong Kong.  Geely Automobile
Holdings Ltd. , whose parent bought Volvo Cars, lost 6 percent to
HK$3.43. The city of Beijing introduced measures including
limiting the number of new passenger vehicles in the Chinese
capital to ease congested roads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
