Banco Santander SA  said its Mexican
unit agreed to pay 2 billion pesos ($162 million) for the
mortgage operations of General Electric Co. to become that
country’s second-largest home lender.  Santander will gain a portfolio of about 24 billion pesos
in the deal, which will be completed in the first half of 2011,
the Madrid-based bank said today in a statement to Mexico’s
stock exchange. Santander agreed to pay undisclosed financing
costs, according to the statement.  Santander is expanding in Latin America’s second-largest
economy after agreeing in June to pay $2.5 billion to buy back
the stake in its Mexican unit that it had sold to Bank of
America Corp. in 2003. GE Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt 
has sold units including plastic and reinsurance to streamline
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company, the world’s biggest
maker of jet engines, power-plant turbines and locomotives.  “This sale is consistent with our strategy to exit non-
strategic businesses that lack scale to help reduce GE Capital’s
balance sheet while investing in core industrial and commercial
finance platforms, including in Mexico,” said  Mark Begor , CEO
of GE Capital, Restructuring Operations, in a statement.  Santander had about 34 billion pesos in home loans at the
end of October, putting it  fifth  in Mexico behind BBVA Bancomer
SA, Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit
and Bank of Nova Scotia, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
