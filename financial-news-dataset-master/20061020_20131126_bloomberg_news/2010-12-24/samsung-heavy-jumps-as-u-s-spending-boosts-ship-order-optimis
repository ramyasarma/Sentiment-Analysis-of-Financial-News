Samsung Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s second-largest shipyard, led gains by shipbuilders in
Seoul trading after an increase in U.S. consumer spending stoked
optimism about the outlook for container-vessel orders.  Samsung Heavy  climbed as much as 7 percent, the biggest
intraday rise in almost a year, to 42,700 won and traded at
41,800 won as of 12:41 p.m.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s biggest shipbuilder, advanced as much as 5 percent to
462,000 won, the highest intraday price in more than three
years. The benchmark  Kospi Index  slid 0.2 percent.  U.S. household purchases rose 0.4 percent last month, the
fifth straight increase, the Commerce Department said yesterday,
reinforcing confidence about the economic recovery. The pick-up
may stoke orders for new container ships, particularly larger
vessels that will be able to serve U.S. east coast ports from
2014 following work to widen the Panama Canal, said  Cho In Karp ,
head of research at Heungkuk Securities Co.  “With global trade growing, there are expectations that
shipping lines will look to order more big container ships next
year,” Seoul-based Cho said by phone. “Korean yards will
benefit because they’ve won most of the orders for these vessel
this year.”  Hapag-Lloyd AG ordered 10 container vessels able to carry
at least 13,000 container boxes each from Hyundai Heavy earlier
this month. The shipping line changed a previous order for six
ships as part of the deal.  NOL Order  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., Singapore’s biggest container
line, ordered two ships capable of carrying 10,700 containers
each earlier this year from  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. , as part of a wider $1.2 billion deal.  Jinhae, South Korea-based STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co.
won an order for as many as 10 13,000-box ships from Zodiac
Maritime Agencies Ltd. in October, according to Clarkson Plc,
the world’s largest shipbroker.  Daewoo Shipbuilding , the world’s third-largest shipyard,
climbed as much as 4.8 percent to 37,100 won.  Hyundai Mipo
Dockyard Co. , a unit of Hyundai Heavy, jumped as much as 5.1
percent to 225,500 won.  STX Offshore  rose as much as 3.5 percent
to 26,450 won.  Worldwide, shipping lines ordered vessels that can carry a
combined 591,800 20-foot containers in the first 11 months of
this year, an increase of more than sixfold from a year earlier,
according to Clarkson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
