SAIC Motor Corp. , China’s largest
automaker, fell the most in two weeks in Shanghai trading after
the city of  Beijing  decided to limit the number of new passenger
cars in the nation’s capital to ease congestion on the roads.  SAIC Motor  declined as much as 3.1 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Dec. 9, and was 1.8 percent lower at 15.72
yuan as of the 11:30 a.m. trading break. Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co. lost 3.3 percent to 6.75 yuan in Shenzhen while
 Dongfeng Motor Group Co.  plunged 7.9 percent to HK$13.08 as of
the 12:30 p.m. break in Hong Kong, poised for its biggest fall
since January 2009. Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd.
also fell as much as 8.9 percent.  Beijing, ranked as having the world’s worst traffic
congestion, will issue a quota of 240,000 new vehicle license
plates through a lottery system next year, with about 88 percent
allocated to individual buyers, according to a statement
released yesterday. The quota is just one third of the number of
new passenger cars registered this year, said  Shin Chung Kwan ,
an auto analyst at KB Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.  “Auto sales growth in China may be slowed down by the
policy,” said  Xu Minfeng , an analyst at Central China
Securities Holdings in Shanghai. “The market is also worried
that more cities may follow Beijing’s example to introduce
similar policies to curb growth of vehicle ownership.”  Hyundai Drops  Tax cuts and government subsidies aimed at spurring auto
sales have fueled a surge in traffic across China as the nation
surpassed the U.S. last year to become the world’s biggest car
market. Officials are looking to allay residents’ concerns after
Beijing tied with Mexico as having the world’s worst traffic, a
 survey  by International Business Machines Corp. this year found.  Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s biggest carmaker which
sold 637,686 vehicles in China through November this year, also
fell in Seoul trading. The stock fell as much as 3.3 percent,
the biggest intraday drop since Dec. 10, to 176,500 won and
changed hands at 178,000 won as of 2:03 p.m.  The Seoul-based automaker earlier this week said sales in
China may reach 720,000 units next year, with 2010 deliveries
projected to surpass 700,000 vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
