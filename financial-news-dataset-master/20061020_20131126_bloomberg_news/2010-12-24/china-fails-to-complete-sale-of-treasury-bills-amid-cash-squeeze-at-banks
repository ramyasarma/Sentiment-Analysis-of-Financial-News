China’s finance ministry failed to
draw enough demand at a bill sale for the second time in a
month, reflecting a cash squeeze sparked by increases in banks’
reserve-requirement ratios and seasonal demand for funds.  The ministry sold 16.76 billion yuan ($2.53 billion) of 91-
day securities, falling short of the planned 20 billion yuan
target, according to traders at the lead underwriters of
government debt, who asked not to be identified. The average
winning yield was 3.6769 percent, according to the traders. That
compared with 3.22 percent on the debt of similar maturity in
the secondary market yesterday.  The finance ministry in February published a list of 48
lead underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp, Postal Savings Bank of China, Guotai
Junan Securities Co, BOC International (China) Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
