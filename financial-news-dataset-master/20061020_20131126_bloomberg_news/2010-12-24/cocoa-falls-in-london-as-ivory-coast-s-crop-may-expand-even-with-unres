Cocoa futures in London fell for the
first time this week as production may expand in the Ivory
Coast, the world’s biggest grower. Refined sugar was little
changed and coffee declined.  Ivory Coast’s cocoa crop for the season that started on
Oct. 1 will be 1.3 million metric tons, Macquarie Group Ltd.
said in a report on Dec. 6. That would be up from year-earlier
output of 1.2 million tons, Macquarie said. Violence in the
Ivory Coast since a disputed presidential election on Nov. 28
has left 173 people dead in the past week.  “Prices are really depending on the situation in the Ivory
Coast,” said  Jonathan Bouchet , an analyst at OTCex Group in
Geneva. If the country’s political issues are resolved,
“shipments could resume at a normal pace,” he said.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 4 pounds, or 0.2
percent, to 2,036 pounds ($3,143) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in
London. Prices are down 9.5 percent this year.  Sugar prices in London were little changed after rising to
the highest level in at least 21 years. India asked sugar
mills to sell 1.92 million tons, including 218,000 tons
to the government, in January, according to a government
statement today.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery fell 50 cents
to $820.40 a ton after earlier rising to $823, the highest price
since at least 1989. Futures are up 16 percent this year.  Robusta coffee for March delivery declined $14, or 0.7
percent, to $1,997 a ton. Prices are up 54 percent this year.  Exchanges in New York are closed for Christmas. Liffe is
closed Dec. 27 and Dec. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
