U.K. citizens are readier to
contribute money to charitable causes than people in the U.S.
and elsewhere in Europe, but less willing to give of their time,
the Financial Times reported, citing the latest public-opinion
poll it commissioned from Harris Interactive.  Only 25 percent of British respondents said they would do
voluntary work to support public services such as health care,
education and policing, compared with 42 percent in Italy and
the U.S., the newspaper said.  On the other hand, 77 percent of the Britons said they had
given money to charity in the previous 12 months, compared with
72 percent in the U.S. and 41 percent in Germany, the FT said.  The results of the poll may be seen as casting doubt on the
U.K. government’s attempt to sell the notion of “the big
society,” with local volunteers taking on some functions from
the state, the newspaper said.  The poll of 6,260 adults in Britain, Germany, France,
Italy, Spain and the U.S. was conducted online between Dec. 8
and Dec. 13, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
