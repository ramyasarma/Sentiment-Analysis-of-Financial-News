Kenya’s shilling weakened for the
third day, its longest streak of declines in a month, as both
supply and demand for currency fell ahead of the Christmas
holiday, a dealer said.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined 0.2
percent to 80.70 to the dollar at 11:45 a.m. in Nairobi, from a
close of 80.55 yesterday.  “Guys are winding up and we are only seeing residual
corporate demand,”  Bernard Matimu , chief dealer at Nairobi-
based  NIC Bank Ltd.  said in a telephone interview today. “There
is very little in terms of supply and demand.”  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency against
six trading partners, gained 0.1 percent to 80.363 from
Thursday’s close of 80.496.  To contact the reporter on this story:
