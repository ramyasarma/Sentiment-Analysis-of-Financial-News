     Dec. 24 (Bloomberg) ---  China National Offshore Oil Corp. 
will halt oil exploration at its last block in Kenya next week
to focus on neighboring Uganda, after failing to strike
commercially viable oil or gas, Business Daily reported.  The Chinese company was the biggest single investor in
Kenya’s exploration industry three years ago with six of the
country’s 22 exploration blocks, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Energy,
 Patrick Nyoike .  The company’s departure will leave exploration in the hands
of Texas-based  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , which has five blocks,
and the U.K.’s  Tullow Oil Plc , which has five blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
