The euro will overcome the region’s
deficit crisis and support the stability of the international
monetary system, said Song Zhe, China’s ambassador to the
European Union.  The strengthening of the euro’s status will help “promote
the building of a diversified global currency system,” Song
said in a  statement  on the Foreign Ministry’s website yesterday.  Vice Premier  Wang Qishan  said on Dec. 21 his nation has
taken “concrete action” to help the EU address its debt
crisis. China is willing to invest 4 billion euros ($5.3
billion) to 5 billion euros in Portuguese government debt in the
first quarter of next year, Jornal de Negocios reported on Dec.
16, without saying where it got the information.  The EU is China’s largest trading partner, with bilateral
trade increasing 33.1 percent in the 11 months through November
from a year earlier to $433.88 billion, China’s customs
department said Dec. 10.  The euro gained for the first time in eight days versus
Japan’s currency before Dec. 29 reports forecast to show
European inflation pressures accelerated last month and German
consumer prices rose. The currency climbed 0.2 percent to 108.93
yen.  Europe’s M3 money supply, which the European Central Bank
uses as a gauge of future inflation, grew 1.6 percent in
November from a year earlier, the most since September 2009, a
Bloomberg survey of economists showed. The inflation rate in
Germany, calculated using a harmonized European method,
increased to 0.9 percent in December, according to a separate
Bloomberg survey.  A press official with the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, who declined to be identified because of the agency’s
rules, said last week the regulator doesn’t comment on
speculation. It hasn’t replied to a fax seeking comment on
reports that China plans to buy Portugal’s debt.  -- Jiang Jian-Guo ,  Judy Chen . Editors: Sandy Hendry, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
