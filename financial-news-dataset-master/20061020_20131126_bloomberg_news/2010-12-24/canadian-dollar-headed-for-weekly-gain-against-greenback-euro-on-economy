Canada’s dollar made weekly gains
against its U.S. peer and the euro as crude oil at a two-year
high and rising stock prices spurred demand for higher-yielding
assets.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, is up 2 percent
this month and 0.8 percent over the past five days versus the
greenback, rebounding from two consecutive weekly losses, on
speculation the  Bank of Canada  will resume its cycle of
interest-rate increases in 2011. The loonie has gained more than
12 percent this year versus the Danish krone, the most among its
16 most-traded counterparts.  “Canadian data has not been bad enough to change
perceptions that the Bank of Canada will start to hike in the
second quarter,”  David Watt , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, wrote in an e-
mail. “There are few reasons for the rally in the U.S. dollar
versus the Canadian dollar to be sustained and good argument to
fade it.”  The Canadian currency climbed to C$1.0062 per U.S. dollar
at 11:47 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0140 on Dec. 17. It
appreciated 1.3 percent to C$1.3198 versus the euro, after five
straight gains through today.  “The U.S. growth picture still seems pretty good,” Watt
said. “Risk sentiment is holding its own. Stocks continue to
churn out gains and now oil prices are starting to gain
momentum. A test of parity will likely align with a test of $100
a barrel in oil.”  Bank of Canada  Brent crude oil rose as much as 49 cents to $94.74 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest
since October 2008. Prices have gained 2.3 percent this week,
and 20 percent this year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent this week.
U.S. markets are closed today.  The Bank of Canada, which next meets Jan. 18, left its
benchmark interest rate at 1 percent on Dec. 7 for a second
straight time to gauge the global economic recovery after three
successive increases.  Economists predict the central bank will lift the target
overnight rate to 1.25 percent by the end of June, according to
the weighted average of 23 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Canadian government bonds were mixed. The benchmark 10-year
note’s yield fell 2 basis points to 3.17 percent, from 3.19
percent on Dec. 17. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The
yield touched 3.37 percent Dec. 14, the highest since June 21.
The price of the 3.5 percent security due in June 2020 rose 11
cents to C$102.55.  Bond Yields  Two-year yields rose six basis points to 1.70 percent.
Five-year yields climbed five basis points to 2.44 percent.  Government bonds have lost 0.4 percent this month, paring
the gain this year to 5.8 percent, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Index.  Canadian  gross domestic product  grew 0.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of C$1.24 trillion ($1.22
trillion) in October following a 0.1 percent contraction in
September, the nation’s statistics agency said yesterday in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 0.3
percent gain, based on the median of 21 forecasts.  Reports earlier in the week showed wholesale prices
unexpectedly stalled, inflation decelerated, while retail sales
rose more than economists had forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
