TNK-BP , the Russian joint venture of
BP Plc and a group of Russian billionaires, delayed the
appointment of  Maxim Barsky  as chief executive officer.  Barsky will take over from billionaire shareholder  Mikhail Fridman  sometime next year after the “finalization of stock
options and long-term incentive plans,” the Moscow-based
company said in a statement today following a board meeting.  In November 2009, TNK-BP agreed to keep Fridman as interim
head of the company through 2010 before promoting Barsky to the
top job from Jan. 1, 2011. The succession plan ended a dispute
between the rival groups of shareholders that resulted in former
CEO  Bob Dudley  being forced to flee Russia in 2008. Dudley has
since taken over as head of London-based BP.  At today’s meeting, TNK-BP’s board approved a 15 percent
increase in the company’s “organic” investment program to $4.6
billion next year, according to a statement. The producer aims
to increase oil and gas output by 1.3 percent to an average of
1.96 million barrels a day in 2011.  The board also accepted the resignation of Executive
Director  Viktor Vekselberg , another of the shareholders, though
he will remain a board member. BP Deputy Chief Financial Officer
 Brian Gilvary  will replace Ian MacDonald on the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
