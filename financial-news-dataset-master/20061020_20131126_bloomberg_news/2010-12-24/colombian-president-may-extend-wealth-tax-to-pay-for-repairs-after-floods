Colombia’s President  Juan Manuel Santos  said his government is considering extending for one year
and broadening a tax on high-income earners to help pay for the
damage caused by the worst rains in 30 years.  The tax, which currently is levied on people with assets of
more than 3 billion pesos ($1.5 million), may be extended to
those with more than 1.5 billion pesos, Santos said in an
interview with  RCN Radio . The tax was scheduled to expire in
2014. The government is not considering raising the value-added
tax, Santos said.  Santos is looking to raise funds to help victims of rains
over the past two months that have killed at least 238 people,
left thousands homeless and damaged about 1 million hectares
(2.47 million acres) of farmland.  The government estimates flooding may have caused 10
trillion pesos in damage and could hurt economic growth and fuel
a short-term surge in food prices in the coming months. Colombia
yesterday lowered its 2010 growth estimate to 4.5 percent from 5
percent after third-quarter growth came in under expectations.  Gross domestic product  rose 3.6 percent in the third
quarter from the same 2009 period, down from a revised 4.4
percent expansion in the second quarter, the statistics agency
reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected GDP to rise
4.4 percent, according to the median of 29 forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
