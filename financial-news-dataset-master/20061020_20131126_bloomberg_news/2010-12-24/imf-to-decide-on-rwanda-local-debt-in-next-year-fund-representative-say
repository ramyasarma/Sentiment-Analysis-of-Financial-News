(Corrects to remove reference to assessment of local-
currency debt in first paragraph of story published on Dec. 24.)  The International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank will begin an assessment of the resilience of
Rwanda’s financial industry in February, said Dmitry Gershenson,
the fund’s representative in the East African country.  “Rwanda’s banks are sufficiently resilient to deal with
shocks,” Gershenson said in an e-mailed response to questions
today from Kigali, the capital. “At the same time, high credit
concentration and notable, albeit falling non-performing loans,
call for vigilance on the way forward. A large proportion of all
loans are allocated to just a few big borrowers.”  Rwanda’s maturity mismatch, where savings are short term
and borrowers demand long-term credit, is a more severe problem
compared with other markets, Gershenson said.  Sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, increased
access to financial services and a deeper financial market may
lead to higher savings in the long term, he said.  Almost 80 percent of Rwandans have no access to formal
financial services, according to a survey commissioned the by
U.K.’s  Department for International Development . The country is
rebuilding its economy after it suffered a genocide in which
800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed over a
period of 100 days in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
