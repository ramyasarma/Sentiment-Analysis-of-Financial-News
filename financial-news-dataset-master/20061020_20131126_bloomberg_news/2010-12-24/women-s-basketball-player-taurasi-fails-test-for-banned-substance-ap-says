Two-time WNBA champion  Diana Taurasi  tested positive for a banned stimulant while playing in
a professional women’s basketball league in Turkey, the
Associated Press reported, citing her attorney Howard Jacobs.  The Turkish basketball federation today identified the
substance as modafinil, used to treat sleep disorders, the AP
said. U.S. sprinter Kelli White was stripped of her
championship medals in the 100- an 200-meter races at the 2003
world competition in Paris after she tested positive for the
stimulant.  Jacobs said Taurasi’s “A” sample came back positive and
that the player has asked that her “B” sample be tested, AP
said. She has been provisionally suspended from playing until
the next test in the first week of January.  Taurasi, who has won two Olympic gold medals, plays for
the Phoenix Mercury and led the WNBA in scoring for a league-
record fourth straight year, averaging 22.6 points per game,
the wire service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
