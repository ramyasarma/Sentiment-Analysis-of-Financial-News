Fans of  Elvis Presley ,  Miles Davis ,
 Bob Dylan ,  John Lennon  and the Rolling Stones know what to put
at the top of their wish lists this Christmas.  Multidisc box sets from each of the stars will provide
hours of listening through the holiday season, if not into the
New Year. For those who are disappointed by Santa’s presents,
there’s consolation in that some of the wallet-busting prices
will drop in the post-Christmas sales.  “The Complete  Elvis Presley  Masters” (RCA/Legacy) runs to
more than 35 hours and is suitably king-size (after a few turkey
and peanut butter sandwiches maybe). On the plus side, it has
more than 800 tracks, including some of the finest in rock, and
100 rarities, making it a must for Elvis completists. On the
negative side, it contains dross (“Froggy Went A Courtin’,
Rehearsal Jam”). More songs are being found each year as albums
are released in new editions, so it won’t be comprehensive for
long. Rating: ***. The  first edition , at $749, is getting hard
to find, though a second edition is in the works for January
2011. There are shorter Presley box sets such as the four-CD
“Elvis 75” (Sony) $40, which cherry-picks well. Rating ****.  “The Genius of  Miles Davis ” 43-CD set (Columbia/Legacy)
also costs $749. This pulls together eight earlier box sets, now
getting tough to find, covering  Davis’s  best Columbia period.
The plus point is the exceptional package in a trumpet case,
with a T-shirt and a replica of Miles’s mouthpiece. Rating: ***.
There are better and cheaper sets available, such as last year’s
70-CD “The Complete Columbia Album Collection” (Sony), which
some online retailers now price at about $240. Rating: ****.  “The Original Mono Recordings” by  Dylan  (Columbia/Sony
Legacy) costs $130 and does what it says in the prosaic title.
The set presents his first eight albums on CD in their pristine
form. Without the fake stereo effects, the words shine, much as
they did on “The Beatles in Mono” set in 2009. Rating: ****.  “The  Rolling Stones  1964-1969” and “The Rolling Stones
1971-2005” (Universal) are the equally unimaginatively titled
box sets of the better  Stones  albums -- all presented in their
original vinyl form. Expect to pay about $310 and $419,
respectively, and get in return 23 studio LPs, two “Big Hits”
collections and two rare EPs. Rating: ***.  “Signature Box” (EMI) is the  Lennon  contribution to the
box-set melee: 11 CDs priced about $150. The set has everything
from bleak masterpieces such as “Isolation,” not recommended
at Christmas, to “Happy Xmas (War is Over),” which is only
bearable at this time of year. Rating: ***½.  “ Apple Records Box Set ” (Capitol) is $330 or less: a
replica fruit crate containing 17 discs by artists chosen by the
Beatles for the band’s record label.  James Taylor ’s eponymous LP
and classical composer  John Tavener  have big potential, while
some of the rest ( Billy Preston , Badfinger,  Mary Hopkin ) simply
cast light on the Fab Four’s passing enthusiasms. Rating: **.  “ Sandy Denny  Deluxe Box Set” (Universal, $350) pulls
together recordings by the British folk-rock singer, whose sweet
voice boosted Fairport Convention and Fotheringay. “Who Knows
Where the Time Goes” is one of the best songs of its era,
though seven versions will be too much for some. Rating: **½.  Also recommended:  Bruce Springsteen : “The Promise: The
Darkness on the Edge of Town Story” (Columbia, $100, rating
***½); “ Michael Jackson ’s Vision” (Epic/Legacy, $40, rating
***½);  Jimi Hendrix , “West Coast Seattle Boy” (Experience
Hendrix/Legacy, $70, rating ***.)  ( Mark Beech  writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
