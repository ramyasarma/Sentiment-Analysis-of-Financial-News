Nigeria LNG Ltd., the operator of
the largest liquefied natural-gas plant in sub-Saharan Africa,
said its liquefaction plant on the southern Bonny Island was
shut down on Dec. 22 after a power cut.  The Bonny community, “customers, gas suppliers and other
affected parties have been duly notified,” Ifeanyi Mbanefo, a
company spokesman, said by phone today from Lagos, Nigeria’s
economic capital. “Power is being gradually restored to the
plant and facilities.”  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 49 percent of
Nigeria LNG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc has a 25.6 percent stake,
 Total SA  holds 15 percent and  Eni SpA  holds 10.4 percent. The
company, which operates six production trains at the Bonny
plant, has long-term contracts with buyers in Italy, Spain,
Turkey, Portugal and France and also sells on the spot market.  Nigeria had proven natural gas reserves of 185 trillion
cubic feet as of January this year, the world’s eighth-largest,
