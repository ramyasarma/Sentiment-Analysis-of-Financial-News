Apollo Global Management LLC , a New
York-based private-equity firm, agreed to pay $1.2 billion for
distressed property loans held by Credit Suisse Group AG,
according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The mortgages are backed by buildings in Europe, said the
person, who asked not to be named because the agreement hasn’t
been made public.  Demand for commercial property loans has increased as banks
around the world strengthen balance sheets and begin to sell
non-core property assets. Private-equity firms including TPG
Capital and KKR & Co. have vied for ING Groep NV’s real estate
investment unit, according to people familiar with the matter.
Morgan Stanley said last month that European real estate stocks
will probably outperform the broader market into 2011.  Apollo last month completed the purchase of the real estate
investment unit of Citigroup Inc., adding more than $3 billion
to its assets under management.  Rick Matthews , an outside spokesman for Apollo, declined to
comment, as did  Steven Vames , a spokesman for Credit Suisse.  The Wall Street Journal reported the Credit Suisse deal
earlier today. Credit Suisse has already written down the loans
to below their face value of $2.8 billion, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
