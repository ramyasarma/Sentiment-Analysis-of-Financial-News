The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  closed
above 6,000 for the first time since June 2008, extending the
benchmark measure’s fourth-straight weekly advance.  Resolution Ltd., BG Group Plc and Schroders Plc all surged
at the close of trade today, dragging the index higher. JJB
Sports Plc rallied 24 percent on the broader All-Share Index
after the retailer announced a share sale to shore up its
finances. Randgold Resources Ltd. dropped after the metals
producer said the political crisis in Ivory Coast would have a
‘negative impact’’ on its earnings.  The FTSE 100 increased 12.85, or 0.2 percent, to 6,008.92
at the 12:30 p.m. close in London, extending its weekly gain to
2.3 percent. The  FTSE All-Share  rose 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  slipped 0.2 percent at the 1:15 p.m. close
in Dublin.  “The prolonged Santa rally has left the market looking
strong ahead of the holidays and there is still the potential
for further gains before the end of the year,” David Jones,
London-based chief strategist at IG Index said.  The FTSE 100 yesterday briefly passed 6,000 in intraday
trading for the first time since June 2008, as reports from the
U.S. added to evidence that the recovery in the world’s largest
economy is intact. So far this year, the FTSE 100 has climbed 11
percent.  Resolution rose 2 percent to 239.5 pence,  rallying  at the
close of trade today. BG Group advanced 1.2 percent to 1,337.5
pence and Schroders also rallied, gaining 1.4 percent to 1,900
pence.  JJB Sports Jumps  JJB Sports  jumped 24 percent to 5.3 pence, its largest gain
in almost six months, after the unprofitable sporting-goods
maker announced plans to raise at least 31.5 million pounds
($48.6 million) to help the company survive. JJB will sell the
new shares at 5 pence each, more than yesterday’s closing price
of 4.3 pence. The sale has the support of JJB’s main
shareholders, while Bank of Scotland Plc has agreed to waive a
January test of JJB’s banking covenants.  Randgold Resources  dropped 4.3 percent to 5,265 pence after
the metal producer said its fourth quarter was “turning out to
be even tougher than anticipated.” Ivory Coast President
 Laurent Gbagbo ’s refusal to handover the presidency to  Alassane Ouattara , the winner of the country’s Nov. 28 election, has led
to violence, delaying equipment deliveries to Randgold’s Tongon
mine, affecting output, the company said yesterday in a
statement.  GKN Plc, which makes aircraft components for Airbus SAS,
lost 3.5 percent to 218 pence, snapping the stock’s longest
stretch of gains since October 2009.  Eatonfield Group Plc  dropped 12 percent to 0.5 pence after
the property developer reported a 13.8 million pounds loss in
the year to June 30, wider than last year’s 4.4 million pounds
loss.  To contact the reporters on this story:
