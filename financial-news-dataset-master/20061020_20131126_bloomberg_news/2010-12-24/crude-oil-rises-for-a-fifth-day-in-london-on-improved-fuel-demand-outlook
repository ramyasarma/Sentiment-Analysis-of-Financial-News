Crude oil gained for a fifth day in
London as rising inflation made investors favor commodities over
other asset classes and snowstorms returned to parts of Europe.  Oil posted its longest rising streak in six weeks as heavy
snow struck northern France, raising expectations fuel demand
will increase. Crude also traded near the highest in two years
after confidence among U.S. consumers rose.  “Energy demand in China, India is growing, but the biggest
mover for energy markets is financial investors,” said  Juerg Kiener , chief investment officer at fund manager Swiss Asia
Capital Ltd. in Singapore. “Investors whose bonds are maturing
are thinking what to buy next. This money will flow into
commodities.”  Brent crude oil for February settlement rose as much as 49
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $94.74 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange, and was at $94.59 at 2:27 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday it increased 60 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $94.25 a barrel to settle at the highest level since Oct. 1,
2008. Prices have gained 3.2 percent this week.  West Texas Intermediate oil for February delivery advanced
$1.03 to $91.51 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement since Oct. 3, 2008. Prices are
up 15 percent this year. Electronic and floor trading is closed
today ahead of the Christmas holiday.  China’s inflation reached a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in
November, according to the statistics bureau earlier this month.
Bonds in the country were the worst performers in Asia for the
second time in four years.  Crude Survey  Futures may rise next week, a Bloomberg News survey of 30
analysts and traders showed. Sixteen respondents, or 53 percent,
forecast crude will rise through Dec. 31. Last week, 53 percent
said the market would drop.  Oil rose yesterday after confidence among U.S. consumers
advanced, spurring optimism that fuel demand will increase. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of  consumer
sentiment  for December climbed to 74.5 from 71.6 in November.  Market conditions will determine whether the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries decides to increase production
quotas next year, Shokri Ghanem, chairman of Libya’s National
Oil Corp. told reporters in Cairo, without specifying a
timeframe. Libya’s top oil official is in the Egyptian capital
to attend a Dec. 25 meeting of OPEC’s seven Arab-country members.
Oil prices will reach $100 a barrel, Ghanem said.  OPEC, which accounts for 40 percent of global oil supply,
decided at its last meeting in Quito, Ecuador, on Dec. 11 to
maintain its production target of 24.845 million barrels a day,
set in 2008. OPEC’s next meeting is scheduled for June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
