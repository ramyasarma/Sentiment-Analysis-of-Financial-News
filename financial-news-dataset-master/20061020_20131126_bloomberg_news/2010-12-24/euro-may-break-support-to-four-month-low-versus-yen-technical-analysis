The euro may fall to a four-month
low against the yen should it drop below major support levels
established in the past month, said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and
currency dealer at Okasan Securities Co.  Support at 108.35 yen marks the euro’s weakest point on
Nov. 30, and the 108.49 yen level represents an ascending trend
line that connects the lows of Aug. 24, Sept. 8 and Dec. 23,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Daily momentum indicators
such as the moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD, also
show the euro is likely to weaken versus the yen, Soma said.  “The euro looks pretty bad against the yen on the
charts,” Tokyo-based Soma said in an interview. “The bias is
on the downside, with a clear break below 108.35 yen targeting
the August low of 105.44 yen.”  Europe’s currency rose to 109.04 yen at 9:53 a.m. in Tokyo
from 108.74 yen in New York yesterday, when it fell to 108.46
yen, the least since Dec. 1. The 105.44 yen level reached on
Aug. 24 was the weakest since July 2001. The euro has sunk 18
percent against Japan’s currency this year, set for the biggest
loss since 2008.  The euro’s MACD against the yen was minus 0.7102 today,
below the signal line of minus 0.5405, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day
exponential moving average from the 12-day average. The signal
line is a nine-day exponential moving average of the MACD , and
provides buy and sell signals to some analysts.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy
orders may be clustered while resistance refers to a level where
there may be sell orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
