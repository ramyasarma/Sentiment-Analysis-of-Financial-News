Halifax Bank, the mortgage-lending
division of  Lloyds Banking Group , said it was unable to process
debit and credit card transactions overnight due to a technical
problem.  An unspecified number of customers would have been unable
to use their debit and credit cards last night and early this
morning, Lloyds spokesman Ian Kitts said by phone today. All
delayed transactions have been processed and customers shouldn’t
experience problems today, he said.  “Due to a technical error overnight, we experienced a
slight delay in processing debits and credits for Halifax and
Bank of Scotland customers,” Kitts said in an e-mailed
statement. “This only affected transactions that were due to be
processed through the night.”  Halifax apologized for any inconvenience caused to
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
