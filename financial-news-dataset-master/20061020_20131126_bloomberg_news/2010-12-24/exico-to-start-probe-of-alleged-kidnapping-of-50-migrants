Mexican authorities are
investigating allegations that about 50 Central Americans were
kidnapped in the southern part of the country.  Interior Minister  Francisco Blake Mora  instructed state and
federal police to intensify efforts “to clear up the facts”
about the alleged incident in the town of Chahuites in Oaxaca
state on Dec. 16. Blake Mora will be in touch with his
counterparts in all three countries, yesterday’s e-mailed
 statement  said.  The governments of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador
asked Mexican authorities to investigate the kidnapping of 50
migrants and find the victims in a joint  statement  Dec. 22.  The Central American nations “demand that those responsible
are found and punished to prevent this type of crime from
occurring again,” the statement said.  The governments called on Mexico to investigate the
incident after hearing witness accounts, according to the
statement.  The probe follows the August discovery of 72 bodies of
Central American and South American migrants in a mass grave in
the state of Tamaulipas, on the U.S. border. Criminal gangs in
Mexico have a history of extorting money from migrants,
 Alejandro Poire , the government’s security spokesman, said that
month.  Editors: Jonathan Roeder, Ben Richardson  To contact the reporters on this story:
