SAP AG  argued in a court filing that
it shouldn’t have to pay $211.7 million in interest that  Oracle
Corp.  claims it is owed as part of a $1.3 billion copyright-
infringement jury verdict it won against SAP last month.  SAP , based in Walldorf, Germany, said in today’s filing in
federal court in Oakland, California, that it will argue later
that the entire verdict should be thrown out. Meanwhile, any
interest awarded in the case would be “duplicative” of the
jury award, SAP said in the filing.  Oracle , based in Redwood City, California, and the second-
largest maker of business application software behind  SAP ,
claims interest on the verdict should go back to 2005 and 2006
when SAP should have negotiated a license for the software
copyrights that were infringed.  “Even if prejudgment interest were not duplicative, the
jury’s award, if it stands, more than adequately accomplishes
the goals” of copyright protections, according to the filing.
The jury award “fully compensates, and, really, overcompensates
Oracle,” SAP argued.  The $1.3 billion in damages awarded Nov. 23 for copyright
infringement by a now defunct SAP software maintenance unit
called TomorrowNow is the largest U.S. jury award of 2010,
according to Bloomberg data.  Deborah Hellinger , an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
