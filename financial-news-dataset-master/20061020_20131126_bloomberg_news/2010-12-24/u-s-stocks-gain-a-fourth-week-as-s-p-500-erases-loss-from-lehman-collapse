U.S. stocks rose for a fourth week,
completing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s recovery from the
plunge that followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008
collapse, after data showed the economy is gaining strength.  The S&P 500 fell yesterday after its price-earnings
multiple climbed to a six-month high. JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Alcoa Inc. and Bank of America Corp. climbed more than 3.9
percent to lead gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  after
the economy grew last quarter at a faster pace than previously
estimated.  Chesapeake Energy Corp.  rallied 9.9 percent after
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  boosted his ownership of the
second-biggest U.S. natural-gas producer.  The  S&P 500  rose 1 percent to 1,256.77 this week, topping
its close of 1,251.70 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading
session before Lehman filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy and
prompted a 46 percent drop for the stock index through March
2009. The  Dow  added 81.58 points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,573.49.
U.S. stock exchanges are closed today for the Christmas holiday.  “This week reflects a gradual increase in investor
optimism,” said  Mark Freeman , a money manager at Westwood
Management Corp. in Dallas, which oversees $10.5 billion. “That
optimism is based on data that is showing an economy gradually
improving. The Lehman milestone reinforces the notion that we’re
in a recovery process.”  GDP Report  The  S&P 500  rallied after a report showed the world’s
largest economy expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, marking a pickup in growth that may extend into
2011 as companies and consumers gain confidence to spend. The
revised increase in gross domestic product compares with a 2.5
percent estimate issued last month. The stock rally pushed the
benchmark index’s valuation to 15.7 times reported profits, the
highest since June.  Optimism about U.S.  stocks  among investment newsletter
writers rose to the highest level since the middle of October
2007. The proportion of bullish publications among about 130
tracked by Investors Intelligence, which has examined forecasts
in newsletters since 1963, jumped to 58.8 percent on Dec. 21,
from 56.8 percent a week earlier. The S&P 500 has risen 14 of
the past 17 weeks, which last happened in 1972, according to
 Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s New York-based senior index analyst.  Alcoa rose 5.4 percent to $15.34 for the second-biggest
gain in the Dow as TheStreet.com’s  Jim Cramer  said the largest
U.S. aluminum producer may be bought for $22 a share next year.  “We won’t comment on speculation,” said Mike Belwood, an
Alcoa spokesman.  JPMorgan Gains  JPMorgan  rose the most in the 30-stock Dow, gaining 6.1
percent to $42.08 and helping drive financial stocks to a 2.4
percent gain as a group, the most among 10 industries in the S&P
500. Federal lawmakers agreed on Dec. 21 to fund the government
at current levels through March 4, denying budget increases
financial regulators had sought to meet new responsibilities
imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul of the
industry approved by Congress in July.  Bank of America  climbed 3.9 percent to $13.06. Information
on the lender that may be released by WikiLeaks, a group that
publishes leaked government and corporate documents on its
website, is unlikely to be new, said  Dick Bove , an analyst at
Rochdale Securities.  Chesapeake surged 9.9 percent to $25.61. Icahn, the 74-
year-old investor known for buying into companies he deems
undervalued and pushing for a change or sale, boosted his stake
in the company to about 5 percent from 2.5 percent and said he
is holding talks with management about raising the share price.  Jabil Circuit Inc.  had the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
jumping 14 percent to $19.93. The electronics manufacturer
forecast second-quarter earnings of at least 49 cents a share,
exceeding the 45-cent average of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  American Express Co.  fell 2.8 percent to $42.77 after
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said proposed federal caps on debit-card
fees may be followed by similar cuts for credit cards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
