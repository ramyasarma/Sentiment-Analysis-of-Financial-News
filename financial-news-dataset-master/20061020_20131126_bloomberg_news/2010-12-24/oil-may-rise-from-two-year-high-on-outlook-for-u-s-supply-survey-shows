Oil may increase from a two-year
high next week amid speculation that the U.S. Energy Department
will report inventories tumbled this week, extending the biggest
monthly supply drop in four years.  Sixteen of 30 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast crude oil
will rise through Dec. 31. Eight respondents, or 27 percent,
predicted prices will fall and six estimated there would be
little change. Last week, 53 percent of analysts forecast the
market would drop.  Supplies fell 5.33 million barrels last week to 340.7
million, government figures released Dec. 22 showed. Stockpiles
have declined by 19 million barrels, or 5.3 percent, this month,
the most since December 2006. The drop was mainly along the Gulf
Coast, where refiners have a tax incentive to cut inventories at
year’s end. Prices touched a two-year high of $91.63 yesterday.  “Another supportive inventory report and early positive
indications regarding the just-ended holiday shopping season
will further the year-end rally,” said  John Kilduff , a partner
at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses
on energy. “A run at $100 per barrel is possible.”  Same-store sales at a selection of U.S. retailers posted
their biggest holiday jump last week, climbing 4.2 percent,
according to a chain-store sales index released Dec. 21 by the
New York-based International Council of Shopping Centers and
 Goldman Sachs Group . Household purchases increased in November
for a fifth month, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday.  Crude oil for February delivery increased $2.91, or 3.3
percent, to $91.51 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement price since Oct. 3, 2008.
Futures are up 19 percent from a year ago. Nymex floor trading
is closed today for the Christmas holiday.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 46 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
