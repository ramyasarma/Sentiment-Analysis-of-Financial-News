Mylan Inc.  agreed to pay $65 million
to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. and Texas alleging it inflated
prescription drug prices, increasing the cost of reimbursing
pharmacies and other providers.  The generic-drug maker, based in Pittsburgh, admitted no
wrongdoing in agreeing to the payment, it said today in a
statement.  Since 2003, Mylan has been sued by 18 states making similar
allegations, according to the company’s 2009 annual report filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Last year, Mylan, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson
agreed to pay $124 million to settle claims they violated the
U.S. False Claims Act by underpaying Medicaid rebates, the
Justice Department said.  The current suit was provisionally resolved early this
year, Mylan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
