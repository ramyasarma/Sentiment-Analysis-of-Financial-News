Police in Mumbai are hunting a four-
member team of a Pakistan-based militant group said to be
planning attacks in the city, Agence France-Presse reported,
citing Joint Commissioner of Police Himanshu Roy.  The group is planning strikes during the Christmas and New
Year festivities, Roy said, according to the report. The police
released a photograph of one of the alleged members of the
Lashkar-e-Taiba, blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed
166 people, and appealed people to be on their guard, AFP said.  The police warning came after security was stepped up in
Mumbai earlier in the week following intelligence reports of a
possible terror attack targeting foreigners, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
