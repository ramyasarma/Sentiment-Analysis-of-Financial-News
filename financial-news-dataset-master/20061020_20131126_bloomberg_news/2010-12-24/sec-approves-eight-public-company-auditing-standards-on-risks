The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission approved new accounting rules designed to help
investors assess fraud risks and material changes in a public
company’s financial condition.  The changes are “designed to benefit investors by
establishing requirements that enhance the effectiveness of the
auditor’s assessment of and response to the risks of material
misstatement in an audit,” the regulator said yesterday in a
statement.  Changes include more emphasis on fraud risks, disclosures,
multilocation audit requirements, and a new concept of
materiality, the SEC said as it approved the rules, proposed in
September by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The risk standards replace rules written 20 to 30 years
ago, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
