Apollo Tyres Ltd ., India’s biggest
tiremaker by market value, paced gains among its rivals after
the government reduced the import tax on natural rubber to help
lower the cost of the main raw material.  Apollo surged as much as 5 percent to 67.1 rupees and was
at 66.4 rupees at 11:24 a.m. Mumbai time.  MRF Ltd. , the second
biggest, jumped as much as 4.6 percent to 7,510.4 rupees and  JK
Tyre & Industries Ltd.  surged 7 percent to 144 rupees, the most
since since Sept. 6.  All three companies were among the best performers today on
the BSE 500 Index, according to Bloomberg data.  India, the fourth-biggest natural-rubber producer, reduced
the import tax to 7.5 percent for purchases up to 40,000 tons
until March 31, from 20 percent, after tire companies sought a
concessional rate amid a record rally in prices of the material.
Rubber accounts for 42 percent of their raw-material expenses.  Futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange reached a 30-year
high of 383 yen on Nov. 11 as rain in Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia, the top three growers, interrupted tapping and lowered
output.  Prices  in India reached a record last month, exceeding
200 rupees a kilogram for the first time.  India Trade Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said Nov. 30 that the
government may allow imports of as much as 100,000 tons at a
lower duty to meet surging demand for tires as rising incomes
boost car sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
