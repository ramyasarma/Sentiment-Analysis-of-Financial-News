China plans to organize patrols to
safeguard fishing around the Diaoyu Islands in the East China
Sea next year, China Daily reported, citing Zhao Xingwu,
director of the nation’s Fishery Administration.  Patrols will also be conducted around the Nansha Islands in
the South China Sea to protect the nation’s fisheries, the paper
said, citing Zhao.  A Chinese trawler collided with Japanese Coast Guard boats
in September near the disputed isles known in Japan as Senkaku
and Diaoyu in China, hurting ties between the two nations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
