Thomas Nides , Morgan Stanley’s chief
operating officer, was confirmed by the Senate as deputy
secretary of state for management and resources.  Nides, 49, has been with Morgan Stanley since 2005. His
resume includes jobs in politics and public relations such as a
stint as chief of staff for then-Democratic Connecticut U.S.
Senator  Joseph Lieberman  during his unsuccessful vice-
presidential campaign in 2000.  Before joining Morgan Stanley, Nides was worldwide
president and chief administrative officer of Burson-Marsteller,
the global public relations company, and chief administrative
officer and member of the executive board of Credit Suisse First
Boston. He also was a senior vice president and member of the
operating committee at Fannie Mae.  Nides earned $3.1 million in salary and bonuses in 2008,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The State Department
position pays $179,700 a year, according to the Office of
Personnel Management  website .  Nides was nominated in September to the position, which is
the equivalent of the department’s chief operating officer. In
addition, he will advise Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  on
involvement with the National Economic Council and on inter-
agency economic policy issues. The Senate confirmed him
yesterday, just before the chamber adjourned.  He replaces  Jacob Lew , who was confirmed last month as
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
