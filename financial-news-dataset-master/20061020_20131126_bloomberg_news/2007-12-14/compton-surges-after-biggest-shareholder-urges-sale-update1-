             Compton Petroleum Corp. surged the
most in six years after Centennial Energy Partners LLC, its
biggest shareholder, said the Canadian oil and natural-gas
producer should consider selling itself.  
 Calgary-based Compton rose $1.03, or 13 percent, to C$9.25
on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest gain since October
2001. About 1.7 million shares changed hands, more than triple
this year's daily average of 481,000 shares.  
 Shares of Compton, which is exploring for oil and gas in
western  Canada , have fallen 52 percent since the start of 2006.  
 ``We no longer have confidence that Compton management has a
specific plan to eliminate that valuation discount and deliver an
acceptable share price,'' Centennial Managing Member Peter K. Seldin said in a letter to Compton Chairman Melvin Belich and
Chief Executive Officer Ernest Sapieha  
 Compton should ``begin a formal process to review the
company's strategic options, including the potential sale,''
according to the letter, a copy of which was filed to regulators.  
 Sapieha didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  
 Centennial Energy Partners and its affiliated partnerships
own 19.8 percent of Compton's shares, according to the letter.
