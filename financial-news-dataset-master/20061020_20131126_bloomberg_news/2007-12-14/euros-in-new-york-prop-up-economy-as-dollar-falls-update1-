             Bronagh Cullinan and three friends
from Ireland happily bypassed the Statue of Liberty and the
Empire State Building on a recent visit to New York.  
 Instead, they made a beeline for boutiques and department
stores where they could buy $400 shoes that would cost the
equivalent of $600 to $700 at home.  
 ``We save so much, we can't afford not to come over,'' said
Cullinan, 34. The women, interviewed on Dec. 5, said they each
planned to spend at least 5,000 euros -- about $7,300 -- during a
week of shopping.  
 From  Macy's  to  Manolo Blahnik , the falling dollar is making
New York City a hot destination for Western Europeans. The trans-
Atlantic boom is bolstering the city's economy at a time when its
real estate market has cooled and Wall Street profits have
decreased.  
 ``The power of the euro is the most important thing to happen
to us since we got featured in `Sex and the City,''' the HBO
cable-television show, said George Malkemus, president of luxury-
shoe maker Manolo Blahnik, in a telephone interview. ``We have
affluent European women coming in to buy five or six pairs who
might have bought one years ago.''  
 It's that way around  Manhattan  as merchants and hotels reap
the benefits of euros and pounds having more buying power in
dollar terms.  
 ``We have six days to do our Christmas shopping, and we have
seen all of Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue,'' said Michaela
Gilles, 40, an office manager for a textile company in
Duesseldorf,  Germany , as she shopped for toys at FAO Schwarz.  
 Foreigners made up 17 percent of the city's 44 million
visitors last year and generated half of the $24.7 billion that
tourists spent, according to  NYC & Co. , the convention and
visitors' bureau.  
 Loaded With Purchases  
 ``If you see someone walking out with lots of bags, they
must be from somewhere else,'' said Sharon Mosse, a New York
marketing executive, as she exited Barney's, a high-end
department store on the Upper East Side. ``You hear a lot of
people talking German, Italian and French.''  
 The largest number of visitors is from the U.K., 1.7 million
last year. While Ireland ranks eighth, its tourists spend the
most, an average of $389 a day, according to surveys conducted
for NYC & Co.  
 ``I don't think there are any people left in  England  and
Ireland -- they're all here,'' said Joan Wolff, senior manager of
Macy's Herald Square store.  
 The store, Macy's flagship, has been getting as many as
6,000 foreign visitors a day, she said.  
 ``British tourists would spend 1 pound two years ago and it
was $1.50 in our economy,'' said George Fertitta, chief executive
officer of NYC & Co. ``Now we feel it as $2, and they feel it as
having a lot of buying power.''  
 Tax Revenue  
 Tourism contributed $1.94 billion to the city's tax coffers
last year. Officials expect an increase this year with the influx
of international shoppers, said Marcia Van Wagner, chief
economist for the  Comptroller's  office.  
 Hotel occupancy is averaging about 90 percent this year, and
hotel tax revenue, which totaled $325.8 million last year, is up
18 percent, according to the city  Finance Department .  
 ``It's clearly great for the economy to have the European
tourists coming here at a time when we're experiencing a little
bit of a slump,'' Van Wagner said.  
 Back in 2003, international travel to New York hit a six-
year low, NYC & Co. said. The euro, now trading at $1.45,
averaged $1.13 then, and the pound, now at $2.03, averaged $1.63.  
 ``It's kind of depressing to see the tables turned with all
these people coming here to shop, when we're the ones who used to
go to London and Paris and  Rome  to buy lots of stuff,'' said
Mosse, 57.  
 New Jersey, Too  
 The shopping sprees spill across city limits. Hundreds of
European bargain hunters fill buses at the Port Authority
terminal, bound for  Jersey Gardens , an Elizabeth, New Jersey,
outlet mall where many stores sell designer-label clothes and
accessories.  
 ``Our Irish customers are up 30 percent from last year,''
said Crystal Stell, marketing director. ``All our international
travelers are up.'' Cullinan said her group ran into
acquaintances from Dublin at the mall.  
 Merely being from abroad wins shoppers a deal at some
stores. Both Jersey Gardens and  Macy's Inc. (M)  reduce prices for
shoppers with non-U.S. passports.  
 ``They come to our visitors' center, show their passports
and get an 11 percent discount on apparel,'' said Elina Kazan,
spokeswoman for Macy's East.  
 The deals can be so good for those paying with euros or
pounds that buyer's remorse may set in -- for the purchase not
made.  
 Jennifer Gordon Smith, 32, a magazine editor from  London ,
was tempted by $650 strappy snakeskin sandals at Manolo Blahnik
in Midtown. She already had splurged on a pair of Prada suede
boots for $900, so she passed on the sandals. Once home, she had
second thoughts.  
 ``I have regretted it ever since,'' Smith wrote in an e-
mail.
