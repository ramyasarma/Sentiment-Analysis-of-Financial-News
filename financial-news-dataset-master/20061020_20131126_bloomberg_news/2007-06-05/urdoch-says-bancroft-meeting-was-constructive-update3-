             Rupert Murdoch  held ``constructive''
talks today with Dow Jones & Co.'s controlling Bancroft family
over his proposal to purchase the company for $5 billion.  
 ``We had a very long, constructive meeting, and we've both
gone away to consider both sides,'' Murdoch said in a brief
interview after meeting with representatives of the Bancrofts.  
 The talks marked the first meeting with the Bancrofts since
Murdoch announced his takeover bid for the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal on May 1. Bancroft family members, with 64
percent of the voting power at New York-based Dow Jones, have
controlled the company for 105 years and said last week they are
willing to consider buyout offers.  
 News Corp. (NWSA)  has offered Dow Jones shareholders $60 a share,
a 65 percent premium to the closing price on April 30, the day
before Murdoch's offer became public. The Bancrofts are heirs to
the family that has controlled Dow Jones since 1902.  
 Shares of Dow Jones fell $1.04 to $60.16 at 4:18 p.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading on anticipation the
Bancrofts may accept the offer from Murdoch, 76. The stock
jumped 15 percent on June 1, pushing the company's share price
above Murdoch's bid.  
 ``There's some nervousness about what will come from this
meeting,'' Steven Barlow, an analyst at Prudential Equity Group
in New York who rates Dow Jones shares ``neutral,'' said before
Murdoch's statement. ``Murdoch is not going to cave on
everything. He'll do his damnedest to keep it at $60.''  
 Class A  shares  of  News Corp. (NWS)  fell 1 cent to $22.57. They
have gained 5.1 percent this year.  
 Open to Talks  
 ``The parties had a constructive dialog and have gone back
to consider our positions,'' according to a statement agreed to
by both sides and issued by Roy Winnick, a spokesman for the
Bancrofts.  
 Until last week, the Bancroft family had resisted selling
the company to New York-based News Corp. They changed course and
decided on May 31 to open talks after reviewing Dow Jones's
prospects and conditions in the publishing industry.  
 Their decision also came after competitors Thomson Corp.
and Reuters Group Plc agreed to combine in a $17.2 billion deal.
Dow Jones said on May 8 advertising sales at the Wall Street
Journal dropped 12 percent in April.  
 Today's meeting took place at the offices of the Bancrofts'
legal adviser, New York-based Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.  
 Murdoch is trying to persuade the Bancrofts he is sincere
in his pledge to maintain the editorial independence of
publications that include the Wall Street Journal and Barron's,
as well as Dow Jones Newswires and the MarketWatch.com financial
news site.  
 `Newspaper Man'  
 Bloomberg LP, parent of  Bloomberg News , competes in
providing financial news and information.  
 Murdoch convinced Thomson Corp. in 1981 to sell him the
Times of  London , and won the backing of management with promises
of editorial independence. Murdoch has made similar promises to
the Bancrofts, who he is wooing with letters, flattery and
assurances he won't tamper with the Journal's independence.  
 ``He'll try to show them he is a newspaper man at heart and
convince them that he'll do what's right,'' said Richard Dorfman, managing director of Richard Alan Inc., an investment
firm focusing on media companies based in New York. ``He's put
on the charm offensive.''
