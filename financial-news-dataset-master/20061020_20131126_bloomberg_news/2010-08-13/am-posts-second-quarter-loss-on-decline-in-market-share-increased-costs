             (Corrects loss amount in second paragraph in story from
Aug. 13.)  
 Tam SA, the owner of Brazil’s
biggest airline by market share, posted its second consecutive
quarterly loss after its market share fell and costs increased.  
 The net loss was 154.1 million reais ($86.9 million),
compared with net income of 555.1 million reais a year earlier,
Tam said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Net sales rose 15
percent to 2.61 billion reais.  
 Tam’s share of Brazilian air travel slid to an average 42
percent from January to July from 47 percent in the same period
a year earlier because of increased competition from carriers
such as Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and Azul Linhas Aereas
Brasileiras. Its international market share fell to 84 percent
from 86 percent in the period, according to an Aug. 10 filing.
Tam said operating costs advanced 6.3 percent in the quarter,
including a 37 percent jump in fuel expenses.  
 The company’s results were “disappointing,” Sara Delfim
and Renato Mimica, analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research, wrote in a report today. “Although we expect a
significant ramp up in margins in the second half of the year,
driven by higher revenues per unit, we are still cautious after
the weak results.”  
 Tam fell 2.6 percent to 27.63 reais at 9:55 a.m. New York
time in Sao Paulo trading. The shares have dropped 25 percent
this year before today, compared with a 3.8 percent decline in
the benchmark Bovespa index.  
 Tam forecast domestic demand will rise between 14 percent
and 18 percent this year. The company also predicted increases
of 14 percent for domestic supply and 8 percent for
international.  
 Tam’s frequent-flier unit, Multiplus SA, raised 723.9
million reais in its initial public offering in February, about
a third less than it sought. The airline sold shares in
Multiplus to expand the program and bolster earnings.
