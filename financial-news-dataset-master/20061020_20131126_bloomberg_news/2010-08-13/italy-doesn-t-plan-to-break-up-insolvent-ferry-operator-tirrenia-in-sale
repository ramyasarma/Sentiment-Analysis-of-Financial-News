Mediterranean Shipping Co, an
Italian-Swiss shipping company, plans to bid for Tirrenia di
Navigazione SpA, Italy’s insolvent state-owned ferry operator,
Il Sole 24 Ore reported, citing MSC founder  Gianluigi Aponte .  MSC will make the bid through Grandi Navi Veloci SpA, a
company in which it bought a 50 percent stake this year, Aponte
told Sole.  Italy approved “emergency financial provisions” for
Tirrenia in August to help guarantee ferry services after
failing to sell the company. Tirrenia, founded in 1936, runs
passenger and cargo ships linking the mainland with the islands
of Sardinia, Sicily and Corsica and with Albania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
