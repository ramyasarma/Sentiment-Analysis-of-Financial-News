             OAO Comstar United Telesystems,
Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov 's telecommunications
company, said its third-quarter financial results will be hurt
by a non-cash charge of $196 million.  
 The charge comes from the revaluation of the call and put
option as part of Comstar's agreement last year to buy 25
percent plus one share in the OAO Svyazinvest national fixed-
line phone monopoly, Moscow-based Comstar said today in an e-
mailed statement.  
 The charge reflects the 40 percent increase in the market
price of the Comstar global depositary receipt from $9.25 on
June 30 to $12.95 on Sept. 30. The year-to-date impact of the
revaluation is a non-cash charge of about $222 million,
Comstar said.
