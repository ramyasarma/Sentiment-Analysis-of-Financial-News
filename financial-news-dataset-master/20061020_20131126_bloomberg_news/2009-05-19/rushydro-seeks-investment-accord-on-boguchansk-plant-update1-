             OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s state-owned
hydropower utility, said it’s seeking a binding accord with
United Co. Rusal to ensure the Boguchansk power plant project is
completed on time.  
 About $1 billion is needed to complete the project, which
is being developed by both companies, RusHydro said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 Rusal’s lawyers are studying the agreement submitted by
RusHydro, Rusal spokeswoman Vera Kurochkina said in an e-mail.  
 RuHydro and Rusal are developing the power plant and an
aluminum smelter in Siberia. They have disagreed over the costs
and timing of the projects. Aluminum producer Rusal is trying to
renegotiate $7.4 billion borrowed from more than 70 foreign
banks after commodity prices tumbled.
