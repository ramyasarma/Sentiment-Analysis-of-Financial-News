             Bloomberg's Rich Jaroslovsky 
discusses personal-finance online service Mint.com and its 
impact on the industry. Intuit Corp., maker of Quicken budgeting
software, purchased Mint last year and put its founder Aaron 
Patzer in charge of its entire consumer-financial operation. 
Jaroslovsky examines if the move was money in the bank. (Source:
