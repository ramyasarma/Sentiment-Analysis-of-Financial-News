Australia’s parliament has approved
legislation for a structural split of Telstra Corp.’s retail
business from its copper-wire network with the House of
Representatives today passing bills amended in the Senate.  The Senate, the parliament’s upper house, made the
amendments when it passed the legislation on Nov. 26.  The legislation needed to be passed to allow Prime Minister
Julia Gillard to proceed with plans to spend A$35.7 billion ($34
billion) building the network and pay compensation to Telstra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
