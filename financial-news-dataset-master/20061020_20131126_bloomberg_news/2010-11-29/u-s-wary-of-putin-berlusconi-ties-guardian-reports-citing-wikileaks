Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s close relationship with Russian premier  Vladimir Putin  concerned U.S. authorities,  according to the Guardian , one
of five newspapers that have published diplomatic cables posted
by WikiLeaks.org.  Cables between the U.S. embassy in Rome and Washington
mention “lavish gifts” exchanged between Putin and Berlusconi
and lucrative energy contracts sought by the Italian prime
minister, the Guardian said.  Italian Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini  said Nov. 26 that
the publication of “classified reports” on U.S. foreign
relations could have “negative repercussions” for Italy.  The Guardian also published a  summary  of a confidential
conversation between Frattini and U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  on its website. The summary contains Frattini’s criticism
of Turkey for what he terms its “double game” of reaching out
to both Europe and Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
