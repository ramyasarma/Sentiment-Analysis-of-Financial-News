Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, offered to buy 51 percent of  Massmart Holdings
Ltd . for 16.5 billion rand ($2.34 billion) and will retain the
South African company’s listing on Johannesburg’s bourse.  Wal-Mart has “irrevocable” support for its 148 rand per
share offer from shareholders representing 35 percent of
Massmart, the companies said in a statement today. Another 15
percent of investors have offered “non-binding” support to the
bid.  Wal-Mart is planning to use South Africa, the continent’s
largest economy, as its platform for expansion in Africa to
counter slowing growth in U.S. home market. Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart faces opposition from labor unions in
its attempt to establish itself in the country.  Massmart  rose  2.30 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 144 rand as of
9:10 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The offer needs approval from at least 75 percent of
Massmart investors, the statement said. Wal-Mart will seek a
waiver to make a mandatory offer to shareholders from South
Africa’s regulators. A mandatory offer is triggered when a
shareholder breaches a 35-percent threshold, under South African
law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
