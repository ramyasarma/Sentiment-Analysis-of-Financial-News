British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc 
formed a joint venture with Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corp. to
start an Arabic-language news service, its first foreign-
language channel.  The 24-hour channel will run under the Sky News brand from
Abu Dhabi and start broadcasting in 2012 to the Middle East and
northern Africa, BSkyB said today in a statement. Abu Dhabi
Media is an investment company run by  Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan , owner of English soccer club Manchester City.  “The Middle East and North Africa is a highly attractive
region for media investment and Abu Dhabi is an excellent
location from which to enter this exciting marketplace,” BSkyB
Chairman  James Murdoch  said in the statement.  BSkyB already broadcasts Sky News in English in the Middle
East. The company, which rejected a 7.8 billion-pound ($12.2
billion) offer from  Rupert Murdoch’s  News Corp. for the 61
percent of the broadcaster that News Corp. doesn’t already own,
is expanding the brand to gain viewers outside the U.K.  The service will compete with Arabic channels including Al
Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Saudi Arabia’s  Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal , who has a 7 percent stake in News Corp., will also start
a news television channel “in the near future,” Kingdom
Holding Co. said in July.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
