Japan’s Ministry of Education will
add  196 kanji  to its list of common characters, the first change
since the list was established in 1981, as the spread of
computers allows writers to type out difficult characters.  The “ Joyo Kanji ,” a standardized list of 1,945 characters
taught to Japanese students through high school, will be
expanded to 2,136 characters starting tomorrow, said Yasuhiro
Takeda, a researcher at the ministry’s language division. Five
kanji will be removed from the list.  Review of the additions started in 2005, when an initial
list of 45,000 kanji from books, websites and newspapers were
selected by the ministry. The list was pared by the Council for
Cultural Affairs, a government body comprising professors,
authors and corporate executives, using public comments through
the Internet, Takeda said.  “Our daily life has significantly changed since the guide
was made 29 years ago,” said Takeda. “Now it’s more common to
type characters instead of handwriting them.”  “ Utsu ,” one of the new characters, means depression and
has 29 strokes. The character has been typically written in
hiragana, the Japanese phonetic alphabet. “ Monme ,” a Japanese
measurement of weight, is among the five characters being
removed from the list. A 5-yen coin weighs one monme.  The literacy rate for Japanese older than 15 years is 99
percent, according to United Nations Development Program Report
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
