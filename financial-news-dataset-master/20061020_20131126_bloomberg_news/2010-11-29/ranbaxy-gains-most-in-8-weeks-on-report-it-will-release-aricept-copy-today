Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. , India’s
largest drugmaker by sales, climbed the most in almost a month
after the company won approval to sell a copy of Eisai Co.’s
Aricept Alzheimer’s drug in the U.S.  Shares of  Ranbaxy  rose 3.8 percent to 566.75 rupees in
Mumbai trading, for the biggest gain since Nov. 1.  The Food and Drug Administration said today that it
approved Ranbaxy’s copy on Nov. 26. Ranbaxy will have exclusive
rights to sell the generic drug for six months, according to a
report from PharmAsia News on Nov. 27.  Krishnan Ramalingam , a spokesman for Gurgaon, India-based
Ranbaxy, declined to comment.  “This is a significant positive development,”  Vikas Sonawale , an analyst at Religare Securities who has a “buy”
rating on the stock, wrote in a note to investors on Nov. 27.
The drug could have sales of $252 million over six months,
Sonawale wrote.  Religare Securities’ parent Religare Enterprises Ltd. is
controlled by the billionaire brothers Malvinder and Shivinder
Singh, who sold their family’s 35 percent stake in Ranbaxy to
Tokyo-based  Daiichi Sankyo Co.  in 2008.  Sales of Aricept, the world’s top-selling Alzheimer’s
disease medicine, rose 6.3 percent to 322.8 billion yen ($3.8
billion) in the year ended March 31, Eisai said in May.  Ranbaxy, 64 percent owned by  Daiichi Sankyo , received
tentative FDA approval for generic Aricept in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
