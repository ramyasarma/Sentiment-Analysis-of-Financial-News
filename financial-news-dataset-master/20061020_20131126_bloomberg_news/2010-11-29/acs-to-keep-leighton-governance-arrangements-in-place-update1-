Actividades de Construcción y
Servicios SA , making a hostile bid for Hochtief AG, agreed to
keep the governance framework of the German company’s Australian
unit Leighton Holdings Ltd. to protect minority shareholders.  Under the accord, Madrid-based ACS won’t increase its stake
in Leighton to more than 55 percent and limit board
representation to four of 12 seats, Sydney-based Leighton said
in a statement to the Australian stock exchange today.  Leighton, Australia’s biggest construction company, is 54.5
percent owned by Essen, Germany-based Hochtief, with the stake
valued at almost the whole of Hochtief. Germany’s biggest
builder has been trying to stave off a 2.7 billion euro ($3.6
billion) takeover bid by ACS, its largest shareholder.  “The existing governance arrangements, which have been in
place for a long period of time with Hochtief, have contributed
substantially to the value created for all of Leighton’s 67,000
shareholders,” Leighton Chairman  David Mortimer  said in the
statement. “ACS has confirmed that it does not intend to make
any changes to the current arrangements which exist between
Leighton and Hochtief.”  Australia’s Takeover Panel today said it rejected
Hochtief’s bid to block the ACS offer. Hochtief had appealed
against the panel’s Nov. 8 decision that the takeover attempt
wasn’t unacceptable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
