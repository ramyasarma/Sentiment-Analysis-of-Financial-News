Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach
 Jon Gruden  has drawn the interest of the University of Miami
following  Randy Shannon ’s Nov. 27 firing, the Miami Herald
reported.  Gruden, who is now a National Football League analyst for
ESPN’s “Monday Night Football,” has been the focus of the
Atlantic Coast Conference school’s coaching search, and Miami
would be willing to pay Gruden far more than it paid Shannon,
the  Herald said , citing a school trustee.  Gruden in a statement released last night by  Walt Disney
Co .’s ESPN said: “I am committed to Monday Night Football and
to ESPN.”  The 47-year-old Gruden led the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl
title during the 2002 season, the first of his seven years with
the team. He also coached the Oakland Raiders for four seasons,
compiling a 98-81 career coaching record with five division
titles. This is Gruden’s second season as a television analyst.  Shannon, 44, was fired after his team lost to the
University of South Florida to drop to 7-5. He was 28-22 in four
seasons, and signed a four-year extension before the start of
the 2010 campaign that was worth $1.5 million per year,
according to the Palm Beach Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
