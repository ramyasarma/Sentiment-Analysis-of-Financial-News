South Korean President Lee Myung Bak
said patience only invites more provocation from North Korea. It
is difficult to expect North Korea will give up nuclear weapons,
the president said in a televised national address today. Lee
will build up South Korea’s military and make North Korea pay
for any more provocation, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
