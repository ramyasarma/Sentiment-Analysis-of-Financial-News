Gold fell for the third straight
session as a strengthening dollar eroded the appeal of the
precious metal as an alternative asset.  The euro fell to the lowest in two months against the
dollar on speculation that Europe’s debt crisis will spread.
Investors also sought the U.S. currency as a haven amid concern
that the conflict between North Korea and South Korea will
escalate. Before today, gold had gained 24 percent this year,
touching a record $1,424.30 an ounce in New York on Nov. 9.  “We are seeing people turn to the dollar and shedding risk
assets,” said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago. “Gold is having a tough time along with other
risk assets.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $3.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,360.40 an ounce at 10:09 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal lost 1.1 percent in the previous two sessions.  Silver futures for March delivery dropped 7.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $26.70 an ounce on the Comex. Before today, the
metal jumped 59 percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $1.25, or 0.2
percent, to $680.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, the price surged 66 percent this year.
Platinum futures for January delivery fell $8.20, or 0.5
percent, to $1,637 an ounce. The metal has climbed 12 percent
this year through Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
