Pacific Century Motors, which is
acquiring parts supplier Nexteer Automotive from  General Motors
Co. , said it’s considering more acquisitions in the U.S. that
aren’t likely to take place until after next year.  Pacific Century is focused on making Nexteer the top global
supplier of steering parts, Chairman  Zhao Guangyi  said today in
an interview in Saginaw, Michigan. More U.S. takeovers are a
second priority, he said.  “We haven’t finalized any, but we believe we will have
more in the near future,” he said through a translator.  Nexteer is now the fourth-largest steering-parts supplier
by market share, Chief Executive Officer  Bob Remenar  said.
Revenue this year will be about $2 billion, he said.  Pacific Century, formed by Tempo Group and an affiliate of
the Beijing government, said today that the Nexteer acquisition
will be effective tomorrow. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The price may have been about $450 million, a person
familiar with the matter said in July. The takeover is the
largest acquisition of an auto-parts supplier by a Chinese
entity, the companies said today.  GM, which acquired Nexteer from Delphi Automotive LLP last
year, later deemed it a non-core asset and said in January it
would sell the steering unit. Nexteer, which had $2.1 billion in
revenue in 2008, has more than 60 customers worldwide, including
GM and Ford Motor Co.  Nexteer’s business includes operations in 22 factories, six
engineering facilities and 14 customer support centers, Pacific
Century said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
