South African wine producers need to
look at increasing exports to China, which is set to become the
seventh largest consumer of wine by 2012, Standard Bank Group
Ltd. said.  China “offers real opportunities for South African wine
makers,” Willie Du Plessis, director of agricultural banking at
the Johannesburg-based bank, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “This is particularly crucial in light of the fact that
local demand for wines has remained at very similar levels since
1993,” he said.  South Africa is the world’s seventh-largest wine producer,
and people drinking an average of about 7.5 liters a year (1.98
gallons), according to South African Wine Industry Information &
Systems  statistics . That compares with France’s average of 54
liters. South Africa exported about 390 million liters of wine
in 2009, of which 4 million went to China, Du Plessis said.  South African wine producers aren’t planting enough new
vines and those they are planting are mostly of the white grape
variety, increasing risks to producers, he said.  Planting of vines decreased by more than 60 percent over
the past 5 years, and of the vines being planted, 82 percent are
white cultivars because of oversupply in the red wine market, Du
Plessis said. This trend “increases the producer’s risk,”
making it difficult to adapt to changing market demands.  By expanding into countries such as China, wine growers can
“buffer against market shifts,” Du Plessis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
