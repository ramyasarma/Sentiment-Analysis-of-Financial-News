Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
said the U.S. “strongly condemns” yesterday’s release of
diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks website.  “It puts people’s lives in danger, threatens our national
security and undermines our efforts to work with other countries
to solve shared problems,” Clinton told reporters today at the
State Department. “We are taking aggressive steps to hold
responsible those who stole this information.”  WikiLeaks, a nonprofit group that releases information the
government wants to keep confidential, has begun posting on its
website what it says are more than 250,000 U.S. State Department
documents written from December 1966 to February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
