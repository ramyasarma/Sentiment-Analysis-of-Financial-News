Russia may import gran if the
country doesn’t have enough supplies after its worst drought in
at least 50 years, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said.  “I asked colleagues form other countries to reserve some
grain volumes to ship to Russia should it face shortage,” Putin
said in Moscow today.  Russia’s crop fell to 60.3 million metric tons this year
from 97.1 million tons in 2009 because of the drought.   To contact the reporter on this story:
