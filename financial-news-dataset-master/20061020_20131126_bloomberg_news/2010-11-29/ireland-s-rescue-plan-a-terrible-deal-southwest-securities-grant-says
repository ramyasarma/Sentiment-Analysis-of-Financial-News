Ireland’s rescue plan won’t provide
a lasting solution for the nation’s economic woes because the
package leaves it burdened with an unmanageable level of debt,
said  Mark Grant , managing director at Southwest Securities Inc.  “The European Union has saddled Ireland with an
unsustainable amount of annual interest payments that cannot, in
any way, be met,” Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Grant wrote in
a note to institutional clients received yesterday. “This is a
terrible deal for the people of Ireland. The path is to fiscal
ruin.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
