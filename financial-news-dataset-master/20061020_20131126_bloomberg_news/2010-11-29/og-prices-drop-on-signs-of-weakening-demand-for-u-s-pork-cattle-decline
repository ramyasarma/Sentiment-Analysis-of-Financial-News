Hog futures had the biggest drop in
almost two weeks on signs of slackening demand for U.S. pork and
increasing supplies of animals available for slaughter. Cattle
also declined.  On Nov. 26, wholesale pork fell for the first time in more
than a week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Demand
has peaked for the year, and supplies are ample after
meatpackers processed 4.2 percent more hogs in October than in
September, said  Lane Broadbent , a vice president of KIS Futures
Inc. in Oklahoma City.  “We’ve already got the hogs bought that needed to get
killed for the Christmas holiday,” Broadbent said. “That meat
is in the pipeline now.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.925 cent, or 1.2
percent, to settle at 76.225 cents a pound at 1:04 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest decline for the most-
active contract since Nov. 16. The price has gained 16 percent
this year.  The average hog carcass  weighed  208.09 pounds (94.4
kilograms) on Nov. 24, up 0.3 percent from the previous day,
USDA data show.  Hogs also fell on concern that escalating tensions between
North and South Korea will hurt demand for U.S. meat exports.  South Korea, the sixth-largest buyer of U.S. pork, said it
plans to conduct artillery drills tomorrow on the island shelled
by North Korea last week.  The conflict raises doubts on “how much demand we’re going
to have overseas,” Broadbent said.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.45 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $1.05775 a pound. The price has gained 23 percent
this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement dropped 0.35
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.184 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
