Chinese provinces including
Guangdong, Jiangsu and Henan halted plans to increase natural
gas costs after the government called for stable prices, China
National Radio  reported today  without citing anyone.  Hebei province won’t raise gas prices this year while Anhui
will refrain from increasing heating, water, gas and public
transportation costs before the end of March next year, China
National Radio reported.  Inflation in China rose to the highest in more than two
years last month, prompting the government to tell local
departments and commodity companies, including energy producers,
to keep prices stable.  China raised wholesale gas prices by 25 percent in June in
the first increase in more than two years. Local governments
will decide when and by how much to raise fees paid by
consumers, with a limit of 10 percent above state-set
benchmarks.
