Kenya’s shilling weakened for the
third day versus the dollar, heading for the lowest level in
more than a month.  The shilling depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 80.85 per
dollar at 2:37 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, set for the lowest
since Oct. 26. The currency had closed at 80.80 the last trading
session.  “Trading is expected to remain subdued with no central
bank participation as we go toward the end of the year where
businesses scale down their operations such as capital
expenditure,” Steve Lagat, a trader at Nairobi-based CFC
Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
