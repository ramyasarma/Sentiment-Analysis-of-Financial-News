Copper will exceed $11,000 a metric
ton by 2013 because of shortages, researcher GFMS Ltd. said,
implying a 33 percent gain from the metal’s current price.  The market may move back into surplus supply in the first
half of next year as economies slow, before returning to
shortages in the following six months and thereafter, London-
based GFMS said in a report distributed today.  Refined copper production will expand by an average 3.4
percent a year from 2011 to 2013, GFMS said. Demand in China,
the world’s biggest consumer of the metal, will increase 6
percent annually, accounting for two-thirds of global growth
from 2010 to 2013, the research company said.  Copper for three-month delivery was at $8,255 a ton at 2:40
p.m. on the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
