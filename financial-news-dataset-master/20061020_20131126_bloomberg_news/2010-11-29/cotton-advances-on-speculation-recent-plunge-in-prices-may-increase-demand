Cotton jumped on speculation that
recent price declines may encourage buyers such as China to seek
supplies, draining stockpiles.  Cotton for March delivery advanced as much as 3.3 percent
to $1.1546 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York and traded at
$1.154 at 2:40 p.m. Tokyo time. The most-active contract dropped
9.3 percent last week, the most since February 2009. Before
today, prices had plunged 26 percent since reaching a record on
Nov. 10.  “The prices have had enough correction from the peak,”
said  Han Sung Min , a broker at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co.
in Seoul. “Negative issues, including China’s measure to curb
speculation and inflation, have already been factored into the
market and investors are focusing on demand amid tight supply.”  Cotton for September delivery rose as much as 1.4 percent
to 25,050 yuan ($3,755) a metric ton before trading at 24,955
yuan on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The Zhengzhou  exchange 
would raise margin requirements for cotton, rice and sugar
contracts to 12 percent at the settlement today, the bourse said
Nov. 24. Trading limits were widened to 7 percent, it said.  China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy and
biggest cotton user, has pledged to control  prices  and may raise
interest rates again to limit inflation. Guotai Junan Securities
Co. predicted as many as three increases in borrowing costs by
June 30.  “To control inflation, China may increase its purchases
from overseas,” Han said. “The problem is how much stockpiles
in the U.S. are available for export.”  China Output Decline  Cotton futures in New York have jumped 51 percent this
year, touching an all-time high of $1.5195 a pound in November
amid surging demand from China and plunging  inventories  in the
U.S., the leading exporter.  China’s cotton output may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, research company Cncotton.com has said.  Demand in China is forecast to outpace supply by 17 million
bales in the year ending July 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has forecast. Stockpiles in the U.S. are predicted
to fall to 2.2 million bales this season, down 25 percent from
2.95 million last year. A bale weighs about 480 pounds (218
kilograms).   To contact the reporter on this story:
