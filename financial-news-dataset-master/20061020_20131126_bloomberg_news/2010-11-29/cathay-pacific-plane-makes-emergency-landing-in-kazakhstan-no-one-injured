Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Hong
Kong’s biggest carrier, said one of its Boeing Co. 747-400s made
an emergency landing in Kazakhstan after pilots detected a
cabin-pressurization system fault.  Oxygen masks were deployed on the Amsterdam-Hong Kong
flight in line with safety procedures before the diversion,
according to a statement posted on the carrier’s website today.
A replacement plane will collect the 326 passengers and crew,
all of whom were unharmed, the airline said.  The passengers on flight CX270 were unable to leave the
aircraft for about four hours after landing at Kazakhstan’s
Karaganda airport because of local immigration requirements, the
airline said. The carrier has informed Hong Kong’s Civil
Aviation Department about the incident and begun an
investigation.  The stranded passengers and crew are expected to arrive in
Hong Kong about 6:20 a.m. tomorrow, according to the statement.
The airline has a fleet of 22 passenger 747 planes, according to
its  website .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
