Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian shares fell on concern Europe’s debt crisis may
spread, even after this year’s bailouts of Greece and Ireland.  American depositary receipts of Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, dropped 0.7
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest bank by market value,
lost 1.1 percent following a rating cut at Credit Suisse Group
AG. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest mining company,
retreated 0.9 percent in Sydney today as metal prices fell.  “There remain uncertainties about Europe’s debt issues,”
said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “People are worried about other countries, such
as Portugal and Spain.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 10,080 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,125 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,080
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index slid 0.5 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index slipped 0.1 percent yesterday in New
York as Ireland’s bailout failed to ease investor concern that
Europe’s debt crisis may spread to the southern region.  Valuations, Yen  Ireland, swamped by the bursting of a decade-long real-
estate bubble and unemployment approaching 14 percent, became
the second country to tap European assistance this year,
following Greece. Officials meeting last weekend in Brussels
agreed to an 85 billion-euro bailout package ($111 billion).  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 7.6 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.5 percent for
the S&P 500 and 3.3 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.3 times estimated
 earnings  on average, compared with 14 times for the S&P 500 and
11.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 84.41 against the dollar just before
midnight in Tokyo, the lowest rate since Sept. 27. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Japan’s unemployment rate in October rose to 5.1 percent
from the previous month’s 5.0 percent, the statistics bureau
said today in Tokyo. The median forecast of 25 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
