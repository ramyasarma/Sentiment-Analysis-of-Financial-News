Novozymes A/S, the world’s largest
maker of industrial enzymes, has sued rival Danisco A/S in
Denmark in a patent infringement case, the two companies said
today.  The case concerns the phyzyme enzyme and is related to a
patent invalidation lawsuit Danisco brought against Novozymes
earlier this year in a U.K. court., said Annegrethe Jakobsen, a
Novozymes spokeswoman. Hearings in Danish court are expected to
begin next year, she said.  Danisco confirmed the lawsuit and declined to comment any
further, said Carl Corneliussen, a spokesman for the company.  The two companies are also involved in another patent-
infringement case in the U.S. regarding an enzyme used in
biofuel production.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
