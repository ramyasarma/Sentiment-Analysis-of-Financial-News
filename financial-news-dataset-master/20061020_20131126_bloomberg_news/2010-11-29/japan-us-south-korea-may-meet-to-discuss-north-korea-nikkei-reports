Japan, the U.S. and South Korea may
hold a diplomatic meeting in Washington on Dec. 6 on how to
address the North Korea situation, Nikkei English News said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  The three countries want China to help control North Korea
and will discuss China’s proposal to hold a six-party summit
that will include North Korea, Nikkei said.  South Korean President Lee Myung-bak’s visit to Japan,
which was scheduled for mid-December, is being renegotiated,
Nikkei said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
