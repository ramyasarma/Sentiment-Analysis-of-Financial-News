Actors  Anne Hathaway  and  James Franco  will co-host the 83rd Academy Awards telecast as  Walt
Disney Co.’s  ABC seeks to increase ratings for a third year.  The 2011 Oscars ceremony will be broadcast live from the
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on Feb. 27, the  Academy of Motion
Picture Arts & Sciences  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The academy and ABC are looking to continue growth that
began with the 2009 show, when 36.3 million viewers tuned in to
see “Slumdog Millionaire” win the best-picture Oscar. The 2010
telecast rose to 41.7 million with  Steve Martin  and  Alec Baldwin 
as hosts and “The Hurt Locker” taking the best-movie award.  Franco is the star of “127 Hours,” director Danny Boyle’s
drama based on the true story of a hiker who amputates his own
arm after becoming trapped in a remote desert canyon. Hathaway’s
“Love and Other Drugs,” about a woman who falls in love with a
pharmaceuticals salesman, played by  Jake Gyllenhaal , also is in
theaters.  Oscar nominations will be announced on Jan. 25 in Beverly
Hills, California.  Disney, based in Burbank, California,  fell  28 cents to
$36.42 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
The shares have gained 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
