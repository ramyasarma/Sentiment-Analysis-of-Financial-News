     Nov. 30 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose, completing a
fifth-straight monthly gain, as gold producers advanced after
Europe’s debt crisis spurred demand for the precious metal and
Research In Motion Ltd. rallied on analyst’s “buy” rating.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, gained
3.4 percent as the metal advanced to a two-week high. RIM, the
BlackBerry maker, gained 5.4 percent after the upgrade from
 Peter Misek , an analyst at a Jefferies Group Inc.  “We’re in one of those risk-aversion phases,” said
 Danielle Park , a partner at Venable Park Investment Counsel
Inc., which manages at least C$1 million ($974,000) each for
more than 250 families. “People are not enthused about
equities, they’re worried about sovereign risk. Gold is
something that’s been successful, so they’ll do more of that.”  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 57.23
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,952.88 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
index has gained 2.2 percent this month, second to Japan among
24 developed-market benchmarks. The series of monthly gains is
the longest since September 2009.  The S&P/TSX has climbed 10 percent this year, led by raw-
material producers, as gold soared 26 percent. Eight of the
world’s 20 largest gold companies are Canadian.  The euro fell to a 10-week low today as bond yields rose in
Spain, Greece and Ireland. Ireland agreed to an 85 billion-euro
($111 billion) aid package from other European governments on
Nov. 28, after Greece got a bailout in May.  Gold gained 1.4 percent to $1,386.10 an ounce in New York
as investors sought an alternative to holding currency.  Exploration Results  Barrick advanced 3.4 percent to C$52.91, the highest price
since March 2008. Yamana Gold Inc., Canada’s fourth-largest gold
producer, rose 4 percent to C$11.98 after saying exploration
results in Mexico and Brazil “support significant increases in
mineral resources.” Centerra Gold Inc., which mines in
 Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia , climbed 6.6 percent to C$20.04 after a
joint-venture partner reported drilling results from a project
in Turkey.  International Tower Hill Mines Ltd., which is developing a
gold project in Alaska, jumped 11 percent from a record close to
C$10.56 after announcing drilling results. The company said it
found “the highest grade gold mineralization over the largest
intercepts on the project to date.”  RIM, Canada’s largest technology company, rallied 5.4
percent to C$63.25 after Misek raised his  rating  on the shares
to “buy” from “hold.” Misek said RIM’s new operating system
is “better than expected” and that market-share losses in
large companies are “slower than feared.”  Selling Shares  Technology-patent owner Wi-LAN Inc. tumbled 5.5 percent to
C$4.48 after announcing an equity offering. The company will
sell 5 million shares at C$4.35 a share.  Copper futures rose 1.4 percent after UniCredit SpA said
supplies of the metal will trail demand by 1 million metric tons
in the next two years.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, gained 3.5 percent to C$51.01. Inmet Mining Corp.,
which produces copper, zinc and gold, advanced 1.7 percent to
C$61.92 after saying it will pay Leucadia National Corp. $552
million in cash and stock for Leucadia’s 30 percent stake in
Spain’s Las Cruces copper mine.  Pharmaceutical company Resverlogix Corp. soared 37 percent
to C$3.43, extending its four-day gain to 81 percent. The
company said yesterday clinical trials showed that its heart
drug RVX-208 lowered low-density lipoproteins, also known as bad
cholesterol.  Resverlogix shares had plunged 70 percent from Nov. 15 to
Nov. 24 as the company reported less success with its drug than
Merck & Co. reported for its cholesterol treatment, anacetrapib.  To contact the reporter on this story;
