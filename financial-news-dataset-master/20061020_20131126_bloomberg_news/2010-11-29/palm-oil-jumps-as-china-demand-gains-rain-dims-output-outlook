Palm oil rebounded from two straight
weeks of losses, on signs that demand in China is rising even as
heavy rain reduces yields in Malaysia and Indonesia, the biggest
producers of the commodity.  February-delivery futures rose 3.3 percent to 3,381 ringgit
($1,070) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the
highest level since Nov. 11. The price dropped 1.6 percent last
week and 0.8 percent the week before.  Exports from Indonesia, the top producer, jumped 13 percent
to 1.45 million tons in October from a year ago, the Indonesian
Palm Oil Association said Nov. 25. Shipments to China surged 25
percent to 215,900 tons and sales to India climbed 24 percent to
596,600 tons. The two countries are the biggest users.  “There are enough fundamentals to support prices,”  Arhnue Tan , a senior plantation analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn, said
by e-mail. “With the festive season coming up, and Malaysian
supplies looking vulnerable, I think that crude palm oil prices
will continue to be quite strong.”  Chinese demand picks up before the Lunar New Year, the
biggest festival on the country’s calendar, when demand for food
soars. The celebration will fall in early February next year.  Malaysian palm oil output  fell 1 percent to 14.3 million
tons in the first 10 months of the year, according to data from
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Output in Indonesia may decline to
21.8 million tons, less than 22.5 million tons forecast earlier,
on lower yields, the China National Grain & Oils Information
Center said today, citing OilWorld, an industry publication.  Exports from Malaysia rose 19 percent to 1.32 million tons
in the first 25 days of November compared with the same period
in October, Intertek said Nov. 25. Shipments rose 25 percent to
1.36 million tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  ‘Global Deficit’  “The palm oil market is still characterized by below-
average production growth,” OilWorld said in its November issue.
A “global production deficit of vegetable oils looming in
2010/11 has propelled prices in recent weeks to their highest
levels in more than two years.”  January-delivery soybean oil traded in Chicago, which can
influence palm oil futures as the oils are substitutes, jumped
as much as 1.5 percent to 51.02 cents a pound. January-delivery
soybeans rose as much as 0.8 percent to $12.485 a bushel.  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil narrowed to $49.17 a
ton, the smallest in seven days, data on the  Bloomberg show .  Soybean imports by China, the world’s biggest buyer, may
rise 38 percent in the October-to-December period from a year
earlier, Grain.gov.cn, a division of the China National Grain &
Oils Information Center, said on Nov. 26.  Imports may be 14 million tons, 3.8 million tons more than
a year ago, said Grain.gov.cn, citing its own analysis based on
customs and shipping data. Total imports this year may rise 27
percent from 2009 to more than 54 million tons, it said.  Higher Margins  China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange raised margins on palm
oil, soybean, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, polyethylene and
polyvinyl chloride contracts to 10 percent today. The exchange
also raised the contracts’ daily trading limit to 6 percent.  China has pledged to control prices by cracking down on the
use of bank credit to speculate in agricultural markets and by
selling soybeans and vegetable oil from state reserves.  September-delivery palm oil on the Dalian exchange climbed
1.7 percent to 8,776 yuan ($1,316) a ton, and soybean oil for
delivery in the same month rose 1.3 percent to 9,474 yuan a ton.  CME Group Inc.’s March palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, gained as much as 4.7 percent to
$1,073.75 a ton at 5:02 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
