Bresnan Broadband Holdings LLC plans
to sell $250 million of eight-year senior notes through BBHI
Acquisition LLC to help finance its purchase by Cablevision
Systems Corp., according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  Proceeds will be used, along with borrowings under a senior
secured credit line and an equity contribution from a
Cablevision unit, to finance the acquisition of Bresnan
Broadband and provide it with working capital, said the person,
who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.   The notes will be marketed from today through Dec. 1, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
