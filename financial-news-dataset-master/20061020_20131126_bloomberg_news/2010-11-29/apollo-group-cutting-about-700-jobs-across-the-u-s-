Apollo Group Inc ., which operates
the University of Phoenix, is cutting about 700 full-time jobs,
mostly among the for-profit college’s admissions personnel
across the U.S.  The jobs cuts will save about $8 million in quarterly
employee pay, Phoenix-based Apollo Group said today in a
regulatory filing. The firings will cost about $5 million in the
quarter ending tomorrow, the company said in the filing.  New student enrollment in the current quarter may fall more
than 40 percent as the U.S. government toughens restrictions on
recruitment, Apollo said Oct. 13. The company withdrew its
 forecast  that day, citing the changing regulatory environment.  “In recent months, we have accelerated the shift in our
approach to student admissions, and have refined our business
model,” Alex Clark, a spokesman for the University of Phoenix,
said in an e-mail. “These staffing reductions are intended to
better align our operations with these business decisions.”  Apollo fell 16 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $34.30 at
the 4 p.m. New York time close of Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The shares  declined  38 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
