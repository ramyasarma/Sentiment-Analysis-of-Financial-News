Sugar rose to the highest price in
more than a week on concern that supplies will decline in
Brazil’s Center South growing region, the world’s largest.
Coffee and cocoa declined.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South fell 5.2 percent in
the first two weeks of November, industry association  Unica  said
today. The region may yield 32.85 million metric tons in the
year ending in March 31, said  Bruno Lima , a risk-management
consultant at FCStone Group Inc. Unica forecast 33.7 million on
Aug. 26. The nation accounts for 54 percent of global exports,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Concern about Brazil is looming large on the market,”
Lima said by telephone from Campinas, Brazil.  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at 28.35 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, after touching 28.7 cents, the highest
since Nov. 19. The price rose for a fifth session, the longest
rally since Nov. 9. Last week, the most-active contract advanced
8 percent.  Production in Brazil’s Center South fell to 1.46 million
metric tons between Nov. 1 and Nov. 15, from 1.54 million in the
year-earlier period, Unica said.  Prices have doubled since touching a 13-month low on May 7
as concern mounted that supply will decline from Brazil, China
and Russia because of adverse weather.  In London, refined sugar for March delivery gained $9.40,
or 1.3 percent, to $727.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Australia, Czarnikow Forecast  Shipments from Queensland Sugar Ltd., which handles more
than 90 percent of overseas shipments from Australia, the
world’s third-biggest exporter, may drop 14 percent for the year
ending June 30, Chief Executive Officer  Neil Taylor  said Nov.
24.  Global supplies are set to fall short of demand by 2.8
million tons during the year ending in September 2011,
registering a deficit for a third consecutive year after bad
weather damaged crops in some of the biggest producing
countries, Czarnikow Group Ltd. said in a report today.  Czarnikow cut its global cane-sugar production forecast to
134.5 million tons from 137.9 million tons in August.  Cocoa for March delivery declined $39, or 1.4 percent, to
$2,755 a ton in New York, after earlier gaining as much as 1.9
percent. In London, cocoa for March delivery slipped 8 pounds,
or 0.4 percent, to 1,866 pounds ($2,902) a ton.  Ivory Coast Election  Six people were killed in clashes in the build-up to
elections in Ivory Coast, the biggest cocoa producer, in which a
candidate representing the rebel-held north is pitted against an
incumbent who draws support from the south. The violence
prompted the government to impose a nighttime curfew for six
days to Dec. 2 as votes are counted.  Ivory Coast has been divided between the north and the
government-controlled south since an uprising in 2002.
Supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo hold opposition leader
 Alassane Ouattara  responsible for the revolt, while rebels blame
the government for treating northerners as second-class
citizens.  Robusta coffee for March delivery slid for a fourth
session, declining $36, or 2 percent, to $1,799 a ton in London.
The price retreated 3.9 percent last week.  Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 0.05 cent to $2.0265
a pound in New York. Earlier, it declined to $1.99, the lowest
level since Nov. 17  To contact the reporters on this story:
