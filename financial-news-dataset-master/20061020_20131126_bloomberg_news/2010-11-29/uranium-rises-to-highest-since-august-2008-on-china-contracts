Uranium rose to the highest in more
than two years after China Guangdong Nuclear Power Co. agreed on
long-term supply with the two largest producers and expectations
Asia’s biggest economy will boost its reactor-building targets.  Uranium-oxide concentrate rose 10 cents to $60 a pound on
the market for immediate delivery, Denver-based pricing service
 TradeTech LLC  said in a report dated Nov. 26. Two sales totaling
less than 500,000 pounds took place last week as volumes slid
due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, TradeTech said.  “China’s imports this year equal about 20 to 25 percent of
global consumption,”  Max Layton , a metals analyst with
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London, said by phone. “That’s four
times what I estimate China to consume, which tells us they are
building up stockpiles.”  China’s uranium demand may rise to 20,000 tons annually by
2020, more than a third of the 50,572 tons mined globally last
year, according to the  World Nuclear Association . China
Guangdong agreed to buy 29 million pounds of uranium through
2025 from  Cameco Corp.  last week after striking a deal with the
miner’s larger rival Kazatomprom earlier this month.  One million pounds of uranium translate into about 385 tons
of the radioactive material, according to Macquarie’s Layton.
The metal is processed into fuel for atomic power plants.  Nuclear Target  China hosted its first International Nuclear Symposium last
week at which the country’s nuclear agency’s vice chairman, Zhao
Chenkun, said the target to install 40,000 megawatts of nuclear
capacity by 2020 will be increased, TradeTech reported. China
may double its current 2020 target, TradeTech and Cameco said.  “Sellers were encouraged by the announcement this week
that China made further long-term commitments,” TradeTech said
in the report.  China Guangdong, one of the nation’s two main nuclear
utilities, plans to triple its 17,000 megawatts of capacity by
the end of this decade, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based  Cameco 
said Nov. 24.  China has stockpiled 17,000 tons of uranium over the last
five years and may buy at least 35,000 tons more over the next
decade to maintain stock that is a multiple of the country’s
annual need, Macquarie’s Layton said. About 40,000 tons of
uranium would fuel 100,000 megawatts of capacity over two years,
he said.  “China’s gone aggressively and secured all of the Uzbek,
roughly half of the Kazakh and some Namibia material just for
this year,” Layton said. Although China does not buy uranium in
the spot market, its purchases have drained the material
available in that market, he said.  Deals with Kazakhstan, the world’s biggest supplier of the
material, Uzbekistan, and Namibia has taken more than 6 million
pounds out of the spot market, according to Layton’s estimates.
“I see uranium’s new floor at $55 now,” he said.  Uranium hit a peak of $138 a pound in June 2007, according
to TradeTech, while rival pricing service  UxC , based in Roswell,
Georgia, measured the top at $136 a pound. The price tumbled 69
percent as companies increased output and the U.S. sold off some
material from stocks.  The radioactive metal traded at less than $7 a pound at the
start of 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
