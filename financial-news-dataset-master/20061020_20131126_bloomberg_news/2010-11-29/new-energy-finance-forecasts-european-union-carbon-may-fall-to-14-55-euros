European Union carbon dioxide
permits may fall as low as 14.55 euros ($19.17) this week as
the United Nations issues credits to projects linked to
hydrofluorocarbon-23, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  Alternatively, the price may rise to 15.50 euros if
freezing weather boosts demand for power generation and emission
permits, London-based analysts including Konrad Hanschmidt said
today in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
