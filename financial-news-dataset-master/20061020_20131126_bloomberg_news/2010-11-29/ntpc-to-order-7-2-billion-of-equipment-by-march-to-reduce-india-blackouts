NTPC Ltd. , India’s biggest power
producer, plans to place orders for generators worth at least
328.5 billion rupees ($7.2 billion) by March 31 as it
accelerates capacity addition to help reduce blackouts.  The  utility  will buy nine generators of 660 megawatts each
and the same number of 800-megawatt units, Chairman  Arup Roy Choudhury  said in an interview at his office in New Delhi Nov.
26. The equipment cost per megawatt is 25 million to 30 million
rupees, he said.  NTPC , which failed to meet its capacity addition target in
the year ended March 31, aims to speed up construction of plants
to meet demand in Asia’s second-fastest growing major economy.
Capacity addition will more than double to 3,150 megawatts this
year, with another 5,500 megawatts to follow in the year ending
March 2012, Choudhury said.  “One of the biggest concerns for NTPC has been the
execution of projects,” said  Harshad Shukla , an analyst at KR
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt., who has a one-year price
target of 233 rupees on the stock. With the orders, “NTPC’s
project execution is expected to move up,” he said.  NTPC and its ventures have plants that can generate 32,694
megawatts, according to the company’s  website . The utility is
targeting 75,000 megawatts by March 2017.  Local Units  NTPC  shares  gained 1.4 percent, the most since Oct. 25, to
179.40 rupees in Mumbai trading. The stock has declined 24
percent this year compared with a 11 percent gain in the
benchmark  Sensitive Index .  Companies that win bids to supply the equipment will need
to set up local manufacturing units to avoid delays, Choudhury
said. Delivery of generators must start within 16 months from
the time the orders are placed, he said.  NTPC may form a partnership with Nuclear Power Corp. of
India to build a plant in Haryana state in the north of the
country, Choudhury said. The generator may take a 49 percent
stake in the venture.  India is seeking investments from domestic and overseas
companies to increase generation capacity after the government
pledged to provide electricity to households nationwide by 2012.
The country’s installed capacity was 167,278 megawatts at the
end of October and the government is targeting an increase to
200,000 megawatts in two years to sustain economic growth of 8
percent, according to the power ministry.  India’s economy  grew  at 8.8 percent in the three months
ended June 30, the fastest pace in more than two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
