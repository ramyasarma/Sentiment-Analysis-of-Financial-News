Hewlett-Packard Co. , the world’s
largest computer maker, sold $2 billion of bonds to repay
commercial paper borrowings as companies cut back on the short-
term IOUs.  “I love the fact companies are getting off that ‘CP
crack,’ as we call it, because it is enticing at such low levels
that you become quite easily addicted to it,” said  Timothy Cox ,
an executive director of debt capital markets at Mizuho
Securities USA in New York. “It tells us more and more that
companies are looking to extend debt, get rid of short-term
obligations and clean their balance sheets up.”  Companies are taking advantage of yields near record lows
to  cut back  on commercial paper, short-term borrowings that
typically mature in 270 days or less. The amount outstanding has
declined for a fourth straight week to $1.065 trillion in the
period ended Nov. 24, Federal Reserve data show. HP’s commercial
paper surged to $5.17 billion on July 31 from $294 million in
October 2009, according to a regulatory filing.  The company issued $650 million of 2.2 percent, 5-year
notes that yield 73 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, and $1.35 billion of 3.75 percent, 10-year debt at a
spread of 95 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The 10-year
notes bear HP’s lowest coupon for that maturity, while the 5-
year debt has the second lowest rate after 2.125 percent
securities issued in September, the data show. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  September Offering  The weighted average interest rate of 0.3 percent on HP’s
commercial paper on July 31 compares with a 1.2 percent rate in
October 2009, according to the Sept. 9 filing. The highest-rated
non-bank issuers pay  an annualized  0.22 percent for 90-day
paper, compared with 1.29 percent two years ago, Fed data show.  The computer maker’s long-term borrowing costs have fallen
in the past few years, boosting the appeal of issuing bonds to
repay commercial paper. Today’s offering compares with a
February 2008 sale of 4.5 percent, 5-year notes and 5.5 percent,
10-year debt, Bloomberg data show.  HP last week forecast first-quarter profits that exceeded
analysts’ expectations and said it would boost research and
development efforts. The Palo Alto, California-based company
said it will earn about $1.28 a share with sales of $32.8
billion to $33 billion in the three months ended in January,
versus profit of $1.22 a share and revenue of $32.8 billion
estimated by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service  rates  the company A2 and Standard
& Poor’s grades it an equivalent A.  Sale Managers  HP last sold debt on Sept. 8, issuing $3 billion of notes
in a three-part transaction, including the 2.125 percent debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from that sale
were slated to repay outstanding commercial paper and to finance
acquisitions, said a person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, UBS AG and Wells
Fargo & Co. managed today’s sale, Bloomberg data show.  Seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding is at the
lowest since the week ended Sept. 22, and compares with $1.256
trillion a year ago, Fed data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
