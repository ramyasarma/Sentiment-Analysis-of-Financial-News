O3b Networks Limited , the developer
of a satellite network for phone and Internet operators in
emerging markets, said it completed its $1.2 billion funding
from banks and investors including  SES SA  and  Google Inc.   O3b, which stands for the “Other 3 billion” or about half
of the global population that doesn’t have access to broadband
Internet, plans “to provide the speed of fiber optics with the
reach of satellite, serving billions of end users around the
world,” according to an e-mailed statement.  Beside SES, the world’s largest publicly traded satellite
operator, and Google, investors in O3b include  John Malone ’s
 Liberty Global Inc.,  Allen & Co., North Bridge Venture Partners
and HSBC Principal Investments. The group of equity investors
has provided $410 million, including $230 in new equity
investment.  The new investment “has allowed us to secure our funding
and to achieve our goal of reaching the billions who have so far
been poorly served or completely cut off from the Internet,”
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Rigolle  said in the release.  Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales SA and
Finmeccanica SpA, is building the first constellation of eight
medium-earth orbit Ka-band satellites for O3b, the statement
said. The launch by Arianespace, the world’s biggest commercial
satellite launcher, is set for the first half of 2013 from
French Guiana.  To contact the reporters on this story:
