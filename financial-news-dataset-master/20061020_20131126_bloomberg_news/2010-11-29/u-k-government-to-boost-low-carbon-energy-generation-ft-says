The U.K. government will announce in
the next two weeks plans to set a minimum price for carbon aimed
at increasing certainty for investors in low-carbon energy
generation, the Financial Times reported.  At the same time, mechanisms to promote nuclear power
generation and renewables such as wind power will be proposed,
the newspaper said.  The changes will be the biggest since the electricity
industry was sold to investors 20 years ago, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
