The euro fell to the lowest level in
more than two months against the dollar and yen as an 85
billion-euro ($112 billion) aid package for Ireland failed to
stem concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will broaden.  Europe’s shared currency was poised to be the worst
performer this month against its 16 most-traded counterparts as
global stocks dropped and the cost of insuring debt from Spain
and Portugal soared. Irish opposition parties criticized the
terms of the bailout led by the European Union and International
Monetary Fund and announced yesterday.  “What has been driving the euro today is concern about
European sovereigns despite the fact there has been a bailout
package,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at
Barclays Plc in New York. “There were some moves that were
designed to calm markets but given there are a lot of these
uncertainties still on the horizon, markets are continuing to
sell the euro.”  The 16-nation currency weakened 0.9 percent to $1.3125 at 5
p.m. in New York and reached $1.3064, the weakest since Sept.
21. The euro slid 0.7 percent against the yen to 110.60, from
111.37, and touched 110.26, the lowest since Sept. 15.  The Japanese currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 84.26 per
dollar, from 84.10 yen on Nov. 26. It reached 84.41, the weakest
level since Sept. 27.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid as much as 1.3 percent
before paring losses, and the  MSCI World  Index fell 0.8 percent.  Worst in November  The euro has fallen 5.81 percent in November versus the
greenback, with the Danish and Norwegian currencies in second
and third place with declines of 5.76 and 4.93 percent. The
Taiwanese and Canadian dollars were the best performers for the
month.  The Irish rescue shifts attention to Portugal, which last
week passed the deepest spending cuts in more than three
decades, and Spain.  The cost of insuring debt of Spain and Portugal reached
record levels, according to CMA. Prices for credit-default swaps
on Portugal jumped 37 basis points to 539, and contracts on
Spain climbed 28.75 to 351.5.  Ireland said it will pay average annual interest of 5.8
percent on the aid package, which breaks down into 45 billion
euros from European governments, 22.5 billion euros from the IMF
and 17.5 billion euros from Ireland’s cash reserves and national
pension fund.  “The currency markets are being completely driven by the
credit markets, and until the credit markets in Europe show any
bit of stabilization it’s hard to imagine the euro finding a
significant bottom,” said  Boris Schlossberg , director of
research at online currency trader GFT Forex in New York.  Bailout Compromise  European finance leaders also backed a Franco-German
compromise on post-2013 sovereign bailouts that waters down
calls by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for investors to assume
losses and share the costs with taxpayers.  The euro will weaken to $1.2588 if it closes below its 200-
day moving average of $1.3131, Citigroup Inc. said earlier,
citing technical indicators. It dropped earlier below the
average.  “The 200-day moving average has been a pretty good
indicator going back quite a number of years back to 2007,”
said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at Citigroup in
New York. “A close below that level today would suggest we are
going to extend this move.”  The euro has slid 9 percent this year in the worst
performance in a measure of 10 developed-nation currencies,
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes show. The yen
has been the top performer, gaining 12 percent, and the dollar
has risen 0.2 percent.  Loonie Climbs  Canada’s dollar advanced to a two-month high versus the
euro. The currency, nicknamed the loonie, outperformed those of
other commodity-exporting countries such as Norway and
Australia, buoyed by its proximity to the U.S. and its perceived
safety. The loonie gained as much as 1.2 percent to touch
C$1.3355 per euro, the strongest level since Sept. 16.  The dollar is poised for its first monthly gain versus the
yen since April as concern that military action on the Korean
peninsula will escalate underpinned demand for the relative
safety of the U.S. currency.  South Korea has doubled its artillery strength on the
disputed island of Yeonpyeong, which was shelled by North Korea
last week, Yonhap News reported. The North Koreans have
installed surface-to-air missiles in the area, it said.  Won Gains  The South Korean won still rose against all of its 16 major
counterparts, rebounding from a near an 11-week low versus the
dollar, as investors speculated exporters took advantage of a
more favorable exchange rate to repatriate income.  “As scary as the North Korean situation may seem, it’s not
the real signal coming from Asia, it’s not the beginning of a
war on the peninsula,” said  Marc Chandler , global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York.  The won strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,152.46 per dollar,
the biggest gain in a week. It touched 1,172.50 on Nov. 24, the
weakest level since Sept. 9.  The ICE’s  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of 6 major U.S. trading partners, climbed as much
as 1 percent to touch 81.142, the highest level since Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
