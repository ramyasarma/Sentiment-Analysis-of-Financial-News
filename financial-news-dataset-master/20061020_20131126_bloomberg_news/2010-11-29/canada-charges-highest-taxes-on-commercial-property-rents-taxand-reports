Commercial-property owners in Canada
pay tax of about 54 percent on their rental income, more than
anywhere else in the world, according to a report by  Taxand .  The U.S. has the second-highest tax rate of about 41
percent, while Norway is third with 36 percent, the tax adviser
said in a statement today. Almost 34 percentage points of the
Canadian charges are accounted for by income tax and a real
estate tax. Finland charges the lowest tax rate of 9 percent.  The average tax rate among the 23 countries in the survey
fell by 0.75 percent to 23.5 percent last year, as landlords
benefited from increased tax deductions as a result of
depreciation charges.  “Whilst governments will undoubtedly have considered an
increase to plug budgetary deficits, authorities are clearly
more concerned about the potentially disastrous knock-on effect
that could be caused by a depressed property market,” said
Keith O’Donnell, head of real estate at Taxand.  Norway charges the most tax on commercial property sales
with a rate of about 21 percent, Taxand said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
