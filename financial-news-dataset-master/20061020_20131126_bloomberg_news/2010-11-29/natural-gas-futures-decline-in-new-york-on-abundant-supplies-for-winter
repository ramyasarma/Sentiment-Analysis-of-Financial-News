(Corrects Alaska production figure in 13th paragraph of
story that ran yesterday.)  Natural gas futures fell the most in
four weeks on speculation that above-normal supplies will be
sufficient during the peak-demand U.S. winter heating season.  Gas futures dropped as  inventory levels  in the week ended
Nov. 19 were 9.5 percent above the five-year average, wider than
a 9.3 percent surplus the previous week, the Energy Department
said on Nov. 24. Colder-than-normal weather may blanket most of
the eastern and central U.S. from Dec. 4 through Dec. 8,
according to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland.  “The market knows we can handle just about anything Mother
Nature can throw at us this winter,” said  Phil Flynn , an
analyst with PFGBest in Chicago. “We haven’t seen a price level
that has caused natural gas production to fall off
dramatically.”  Natural gas for January delivery dropped 18.9 cents, or 4.3
percent, to settle at $4.21 per million British thermal units on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest one-day decline
since Nov. 1. Gas futures have tumbled 24 percent this year.  Prices fell after rising to $4.487, a Fibonacci retracement
level, said Pax Saunders, an analyst with Gelber & Associates in
Houston. Fibonacci sequences are used by some technical traders
to predict points of support and resistance as markets repeat
earlier moves.  “We have some major resistance at the $4.45-to-$4.50
level,” Saunders said.  Temperatures may be below-normal in the Southeast from Dec.
9 through Dec. 13 and normal in the Northeast and most of the
Midwest during that period, Commodity Weather Group said.  Cold Weather  The high temperature in New York on Dec. 6 may be 44
degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius), 2 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.
The high in Chicago may be 41, 2 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas  stockpiles  in the U.S. fell 6 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Nov. 19 to 3.837 trillion cubic feet, last week’s
Energy Department report showed.  U.S. natural gas production  rose 3.7 percent in September
as output from onshore wells increased, the Energy Department
reported today.  Output climbed to 75.14 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 72.44 billion in August, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in a monthly report known as
EIA-914.  Gas Production  Output in the lower 48 states rose 0.7 percent to 66.33
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 65.85 billion, the
report showed. Production in Alaska increased 34 percent to 8.81
billion cubic feet a day.  “The production data confirms what people already know,”
said  Allen Rather , an independent energy analyst in Victoria,
Texas. “It’s a reason to take profits at a key technical
level.”  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 30.03 cents, or 7.9 percent, to $4.1185 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
224,585 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
272,000. Volume was 71,100 on Nov. 26. Open interest was 747,985
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 801,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
