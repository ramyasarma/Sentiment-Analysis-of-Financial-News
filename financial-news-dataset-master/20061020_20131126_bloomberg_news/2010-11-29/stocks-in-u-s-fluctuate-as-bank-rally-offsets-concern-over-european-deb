U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as energy shares rose and Wells Fargo & Co. led banks
higher, helping the market overcome an early drop triggered by
concern Europe’s debt crisis may spread to the southern region.  Wells Fargo  led a gauge of banks to the biggest gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after RBC Capital Markets said it
expects the lender to boost dividends early next year.
Halliburton Co. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. rose at least 1.7
percent as crude oil climbed to the highest level in two weeks.
 Visa Inc.  lost 2.6 percent as Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said
mobile-network operators may take market share.  The  S&P 500  slipped less than 0.1 percent to 1,188.88 as of
3:22 p.m. in New York, erasing most of an earlier decline of as
much as 1.3 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped
20.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,071.11.  “There’s a lot of mixed currents,” said  John Kattar ,
chief investment officer at Eastern Investment Advisors in
Boston, which manages $1.7 billion. “I’m encouraged that the
market is showing some resilience after a disappointing day
overall. Oil did not show any weakness and stocks are following.
That against the backdrop of pretty good retail sales on Black
Friday.”  The  S&P 500  is 16 percent above this year’s low on July 2
as companies reported better-than-estimated profits and the
Federal Reserve’s plan to increase asset purchases lifted stock
prices. The equity benchmark has fallen 2.9 percent since
reaching a two-year high on Nov. 5 on speculation China will
raise interest rates to tame inflation and amid concern the
sovereign-debt crisis will spread to southern Europe.  Banks had the biggest gain among 24 groups in the S&P 500.
 Wells Fargo  rose 2.4 percent to $27.30 as RBC Capital Markets
said it expects the largest U.S. home lender to be among the
first allowed by regulators to increase payouts early next year.
Bank of America Corp. rose 2.1 percent to $11.35. Huntington
Bancshares Inc. gained 4.2 percent to $5.79.  To contact the reporters on this story:
