South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for a second day, shedding 465.14, or 1.5
percent, to 30,716.24 in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the company that comprises
about 10 percent of the index, dropped 9.90 rand, or 3.1
percent, to 315.10 rand, the lowest since Oct. 20. Copper
fluctuated in New York and London, paring a climb to a one-week
high as equities retreated after Ireland’s bailout failed to
ease concern Europe’s most-indebted nations will need further
aid.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s biggest mining
company, retreated 3.99 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 253 rand, a
second day of declines. Lead, nickel, tin and zinc also fell.  Coal of Africa Ltd.  (CZA SJ), gained 20 cents, or 2.4
percent, to 8.40 rand, its biggest advance since Nov. 18. The
Australian developer of coal mines in South Africa agreed to buy
the Chapudi coal project and other exploration assets from Rio
Tinto Minerals Development Ltd. and Kwezi Mining Ltd. for $75
million.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  (IMP SJ), the world’s second-
biggest producer of the metal, fell to the lowest since Nov. 3,
slumping 4.74 rand, or 2.3 percent, to 204.01 rand. Platinum
dropped for a third day, losing as much as 1 percent to
$1,631.63 an ounce.  Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, slipped 8.57 rand, or 1.3
percent, to 677 rand, the lowest in almost a week.  Mvelaserve Ltd.  (MVS SJ) closed at 12.90 rand in its debut
on the JSE. The security and facilities-management company was
spun off from  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd.  (MVG SJ), which jumped 33
percent to 2.75 rand.  Old Mutual Plc  (OML SJ), the U.K.’s third-largest insurer
by market value, dropped 45 cents, or 3.2 percent, to 13.70
rand, the first decline in four days. The company may delay the
initial public offering of its U.S. asset management unit amid
fluctuating markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
