     Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose, led by energy
producers, as crude oil advanced to a two-week high after U.S.
consumers spent more over the Thanksgiving weekend than they did
last year.  Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer,
gained 1.6 percent after the U.S. National Retail Foundation
said holiday-weekend spending increased 6.4 percent from 2009.
Cenovus Energy Inc., the nation’s fifth-largest energy company,
rose 1.7 percent. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
producer of the precious metal, declined 1.3 percent as the U.S.
dollar rose against a basket of world currencies. Royal Bank of
Canada, the country’s largest lender by assets, rose 0.7 percent
as an index of Canadian banks climbed.  “People going out and really spending money, that is
largely a function of what they’re going to make in the
future,” said  Jennifer Radman , who helps oversee C$1 billion
($981 million) as a money manager at Caldwell Investment
Management Ltd. in Toronto. “With that comes overall economic
growth and higher energy prices. The more stuff we’re making,
the more factories are open and the more we’re driving.”  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 2.94
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,895.65 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto.  The S&P/TSX has climbed 1.7 percent this month, behind only
Japan among developed-market benchmarks. Energy companies have
led the Canadian benchmark as oil futures have rallied 5.2
percent.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 2.4 percent today to
$85.73 a barrel. Forecasts of colder-than-normal weather in
Europe helped spur fuel prices.  Energy Shares  Suncor gained 1.6 percent to C$34.69. BlackPearl Resources
Inc., which produces oil in Canada, surged 5.9 percent to C$5.39
for the second-biggest gain in the S&P/TSX. Cenovus Energy,
Canada’s fifth-largest energy company by market value, advanced
1.7 percent to C$29.69. Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the largest
owner of the Syncrude project, increased 2.4 percent to C$27.75.  Husky Energy Inc., Canada’s third-largest energy company by
revenue, retreated 3.7 percent to C$24.57 after announcing a
C$860 million asset purchase and C$1 billion equity offering.  The U.S. dollar climbed against the euro and shares of
metals producers dropped after an 85-billion-euro ($113 billion)
aid package for Ireland failed to allay concern over budget
deficits in Europe.  Barrick fell 1.3 percent to C$51.19. Kinross Gold Corp.,
Canada’s third-largest gold producer, declined for a fifth day,
slipping 2.3 percent to C$17.75. Semafo Inc., which mines gold
in Africa, lost 2.1 percent to C$12.05.  Rubicon Minerals Corp. , which explores for gold in Canada
and the U.S., soared 33 percent to a record C$6.13 after
announcing a resource estimate for part of its Phoenix Gold
Project in Ontario.  Banks Advance  All eight publicly traded  Canadian banks  rose. Royal Bank
gained 0.7 percent to C$55.38. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, the country’s fifth-largest lender by assets, advanced
0.4 percent to C$79.41. Regional lender Canadian Western Bank
rallied 1 percent to C$26.78.  Uranium One Inc., the uranium producer in which Russia’s
ARMZ is buying a controlling stake, fell 5.9 percent to C$5.09.
 John Redstone , an analyst at Desjardines Securities, cut the
shares to “hold” from “buy,” citing recent share-price
appreciation.  The shares jumped 22 percent this month as uranium prices
surged and the U.S. approved ARMZ’s purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story;
