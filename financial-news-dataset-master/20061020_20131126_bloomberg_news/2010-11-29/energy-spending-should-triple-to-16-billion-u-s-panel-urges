U.S. spending on energy research
should triple to $16 billion a year and be reviewed as often as
national defense policies, President  Barack Obama ’s top
science advisers said in a report.  Energy policy should be developed and updated with
“strategic quadrennial reviews,” similar to those produced by
the Defense Department, according to the report today from the
 President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology . The
system should be transformed within two decades to ensure
reliable supplies of clean, affordable energy, the advisers
said.  An increase in government and private funding for energy
technologies will be needed for the U.S. to “leapfrog” other
countries investing in energy, according to the report. The U.S.
should use its purchasing power to advance innovation and review
energy tax subsidies that are “misaligned” with policy goals.  “This will be a major undertaking, given the large number
of federal policies that affect the development, implementation,
and use of energy technologies,”  John Holdren , director of the
Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a letter
accompanying the report. “Unleashing this innovation could be
one of the most important and enduring accomplishments of your
Administration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
