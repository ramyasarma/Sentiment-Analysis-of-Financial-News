Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
biggest seller of hybrid-electric automobiles, said it will
repair about 650,000 Prius cars worldwide to correct a water-
pump flaw that can cause the vehicles to lose power.  Toyota plans to fix 378,000 vehicles from model years 2004
through 2007 in the U.S.,  John Hanson , a spokesman for the
Toyota City, Japan-based company, said yesterday. The automaker,
the world’s largest, will also repair 180,000 Prius cars in
Japan, 70,000 in Europe and 7,000 in Australia for the same
flaw, Tokyo-based spokesman  Paul Nolasco  said by phone today.  A fault in the water pump can cause air bubbles to build up
and disrupt the flow of coolant, which can lead to overheating,
Hanson said. In the U.S., the repair campaign isn’t a recall as
Toyota determined it’s not a safety issue and here have been no
accidents or injuries connected to the flaw, Hanson said.  Toyota  rose 0.9 percent to 3,330 yen in Tokyo as of the 11
a.m. trading break today. The shares have  fallen  14 percent
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
