Global Logistic Properties Ltd. ,
which raised S$3.9 billion ($3 billion) last month in
Singapore’s biggest initial public offering since 1993, said
second-quarter net income more than tripled.  Profit rose to $85.4 million ($64.9 million), or 4.9 cents
a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $27 million,
or 1.55 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 14 percent to
$113.3 million from $99.8 million, it said in a statement to the
Singapore exchange.  The overseas logistics unit of  Government of Singapore
Investment Corp. , which planned to use S$1.7 billion of the
 proceeds  to expand in China and Japan, said earnings surged as
it increased the leasable space in China and revenue from Japan
was boosted by a stronger yen.  “In China, strong domestic demand continues to drive
demand for logistics facilities,”  Jeffrey Schwartz , executive
director, said at a media briefing. “We are currently exploring
new markets in China. The scarcity of logistics facilities in
Japan will drive rental rates up.”  Global Logistic has gained 13 percent from the IPO sale
price of S$1.96, including an 11 percent jump on the first day
of trading. Today, the shares rose 0.5 percent to S$2.22 on the
Singapore stock exchange. The stock was sold at the top end of
the range marketed to investors.  Yen’s Gain  The yen climbed 5.9 percent against the U.S. dollar in the
three months, the biggest quarterly gain in a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  GIC , manager of more than $100 billion of Singapore’s
foreign-exchange reserves, owns about 52 percent of the company
through its subsidiaries, according to the sale  prospectus .  Global Logistic  owns, manages and leases 296 properties
within 122 integrated parks, according to its prospectus. It
manages and leases a gross floor area of about 6.2 million
square meters (66.7 million square feet) in its network spread
across 25 major cities in China and Japan, according to a sale
document.  Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. ’s initial offering in the
city-state in 1993 raised more than S$4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
