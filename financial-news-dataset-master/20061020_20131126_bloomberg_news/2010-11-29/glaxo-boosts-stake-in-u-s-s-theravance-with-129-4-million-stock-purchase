GlaxoSmithKline Plc  will buy about
$129.4 million of stock in  Theravance Inc ., increasing its stake
to 19 percent in the U.S. drugmaker that’s helping to develop
the Relovair asthma treatment.  Glaxo, based in London, agreed to buy 5.75 million
Theravance shares at $22.50 each in a private placement, the
companies said in a statement today. The transaction with South
San Francisco-based Theravance is set to close today, the
companies said.  Glaxo is developing Relovair as a successor to its best-
selling product, the Advair asthma inhaler. Advair generated
4.98 billion pounds ($7.76 billion) in sales for Glaxo last
year, accounting for about 18 percent of the  U.K. company’s
sales . Relovair is in the final stages of trials in humans.  “We have built a strong relationship with Theravance,”
 Moncef Slaoui , Glaxo’s chairman of research and development,
said in the statement. The agreement “reflects the confidence
we have in the Relovair program and the wider late stage
respiratory pipeline that we have built up through the
collaboration.”  Glaxo signed its first collaboration agreement with
Theravance in 2002 and entered into a wider alliance with the
U.S. company two years later. In 2007, Glaxo declined to
exercise an option to buy half of Theravance’s stock. The two
companies are jointly developing a number of drugs.  Theravance rose $2.35, or 10 percent, to $25.20 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Glaxo
 shares  slipped 19 pence, or 1.5 percent, to 1,241.5 pence in
London trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
