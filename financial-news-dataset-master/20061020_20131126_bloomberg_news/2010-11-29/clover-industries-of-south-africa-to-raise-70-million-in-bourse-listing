Clover Industries Ltd., South
Africa’s biggest dairy company, may raise as much as 500 million
rand ($70 million) in a public share offering that will be used
to relocate plants, boost production and make acquisitions.  The company will offer about 47.6 million new shares priced
from 9 rand to 12 rand each, the Johannesburg-based company said
in a stock-exchange statement today. It plans to begin trading
on the bourse on Dec. 14.  Clover plans to buy out minority shareholders in some of
its subsidiary businesses and buy "high-margin" companies, Chief
Executive Officer  Johann Vorster  said on a conference call
today.  The company has “a clearly defined strategy to expand the
business and the listing represents a major milestone in
positioning Clover for its next growth phase,” Vorster said in
an e-mailed statement.  Clover’s “primary capital project” is the 350 million-
rand Project Cielo Blu, which is aimed at removing
inefficiencies in the business, including moving factories
closer to suppliers, according to the statement.  The company has more than 14,000 points of sale across
Africa’s largest economy, the statement said.  Clover began operating in 1898 with a butter factory and a
fresh milk distribution business in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal
province. The company operated as a farmer’s cooperative until
2003, when it was converted to a public company. The company’s
brands include Ultramel, Butro, Super M and Tropika.  To contact the reporter on this story:
