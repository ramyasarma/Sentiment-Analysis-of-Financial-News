France’s soccer league will apply to
the country’s television regulator this month for a license to
run a pay channel for showing matches,  Le Figaro  said, citing
 Frederic Thiriez , head of the Ligue de Football Professionnel.  CFoot, as the station would be called, could start showing
second-tier games starting in July and buy Orange Sport to
obtain rights for top tier Saturday night matches, according to
the newspaper, adding that France Telecom’s Orange Group is
likely to pull out of the business.  Soccer broadcasting rights are coming up for renegotiation
for the period between 2012 and 2016, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
