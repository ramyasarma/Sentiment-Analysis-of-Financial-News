Oil traded near its highest in more
than two weeks in New York after U.S. consumers spent more over
the Thanksgiving weekend than last year, signaling fuel demand
may increase in the biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures, which are rising for the third month, gained 2.4
percent yesterday after the average U.S. shopper increased
purchases by 6.4 percent from the 2009 period, a report from the
National Retail Federation showed. Crude also advanced amid
speculation that colder-than-normal weather may boost demand for
heating fuel in the eastern U.S. and Europe.  Sentiment is “bullish after a report showed U.S. consumer
spending over the Thanksgiving weekend was 6.4 percent higher
year-on-year,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today. “Speculation of a colder than usual winter in
eastern U.S. and Europe this year is expected to boost heating
fuel demand, also lending support to higher prices.”  The January contract was at $85.80 a barrel, up 7 cents, in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:48
a.m. Sydney time. Yesterday, it added $1.97 to $85.73, the
highest settlement since Nov. 11. Prices are up 5.4 percent this
month and 8 percent higher this year.  About 212 million shoppers went to stores and websites over
the holiday weekend in the U.S., on average spending $365.34,
the Washington-based National Retail Federation reported.  Temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S. will be lower
than normal from Dec. 7 to Dec. 13, according to a forecast from
the U.S. Climate Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Maryland.  Distillate Demand  Supplies of distillates, which include heating oil and
diesel,  probably fell  for a 10th time last week as demand
increased, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Stockpiles dropped
1.1 million barrels in the seven days ended Nov. 26 from 158.3
million, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates before
the department’s report today. Oil supplies probably decreased
900,000 barrels from 358.6 million.  U.S. consumption of  distillate fuel  rose 0.6 percent to 3.8
million barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 19, the Energy
Department reported last week.  Temperatures in Paris may be as low as minus 5 degrees
Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) today, compared with an average minimum
of 4 for this time of the year, according to CustomWeather Inc.
London temperatures may decline to minus 6 on Dec. 3.  Brent crude for January settlement rose $1.76, or 2.1
percent, to $87.34 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
