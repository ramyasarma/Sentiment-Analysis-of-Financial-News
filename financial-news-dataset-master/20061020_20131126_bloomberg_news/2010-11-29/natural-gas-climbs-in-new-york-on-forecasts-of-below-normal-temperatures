Natural gas futures climbed in New
York, reaching the highest price in almost four months, on
forecasts of below-normal temperatures that would boost demand
for the heating fuel.  Colder-than-normal weather may blanket most of the eastern
and central U.S. from Dec. 4 through Dec. 8, according to
Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland. Temperatures may
be below-normal in the Southeast from Dec. 9 through Dec. 13.  “At least in the short term, it looks like we should see
some cold weather,” said  Tom Saal , senior vice president of
energy trading at Hencorp Becstone Futures in Miami.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 7 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.469 per million British thermal units at 9:11
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after reaching $4.487,
the highest intraday price since Aug. 9. Gas futures are down 20
percent this year.  “As long as the market can stay above $4 or $4.25, we
ought to continue to work a little bit higher,” Saal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
