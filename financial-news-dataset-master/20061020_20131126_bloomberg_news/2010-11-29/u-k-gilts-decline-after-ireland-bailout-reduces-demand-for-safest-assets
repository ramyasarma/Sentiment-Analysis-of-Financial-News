U.K. government bonds rose as
Ireland’s 85 billion-euro ($112 billion) aid package failed to
ease concern that the euro-area’s debt crisis will worsen.  The gains pushed two-year yields down from the highest in a
week as investors sought relative safety in U.K. assets. Gilts
also stayed higher after the Office for Budget Responsibility
revised its 2010 growth estimate higher and the Debt Management
Office increased its issuance estimate for the current fiscal
year by 0.1 percent. Irish, Italian, Spanish and Belgian bonds
fell. The pound climbed to a one-week high against the euro.  “Investors are still uncertain about the fiscal outlook in
the euro area, and very skeptical that policies announced this
weekend will draw a line in the sand,” and are opting for
alternatives to euro-region bonds, said  Nicholas Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for money managers.  The two-year U.K. bond  yield  declined two basis points to
0.995 percent at 4:28 p.m. in London, after being as high as
1.06 percent, the most since Nov. 22. The 4.5 percent security
maturing March 2013 gained 0.40 or 4 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 107.84. The 10-year gilt yield dropped one basis
point to 3.33 percent, leaving it 26 basis points higher since
Oct. 29.  The pound lost 0.3 percent to $1.5552 and was 0.8 percent
stronger at 84.25 pence per euro, pushing its advance against
the common currency in the past week to 1.3 percent. Sterling
has gained 3.1 percent versus the euro since Oct. 29, set for
the biggest monthly gain since June.  Britain’s currency has gained 0.4 percent in the past
month, compared with a 3.1 percent decline by the euro,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes,
which track the performance of a basket of 10 currencies.  Shorter-Dated Gilts  Gilts are still set for their first back-to-back monthly
losses since May 2009, according to indexes developed by Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit. U.K. government securities
have gained 7 percent since the end of 2009, compared with a
2.01 percent gain by the 16 nations that share the euro, the
gauges show. Spanish bonds have lost 3.8 percent since Dec. 31.  Shorter-dated gilts also rose as reports showed banks
granted fewer loans for buying homes in October while  prices 
fell for a fifth month in November.  The average cost of a U.K. home fell 0.8 percent from
October, Hometrack Ltd., the London-based property researcher
said in an e-mailed statement today. Lenders granted 47,185
loans to buy homes, compared with 47,369 in September, the Bank
of England said today in London. The reading is less than half
the level at the start of 2007.  MPC Testimony  Members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee
gave no indication the central bank plans to step up so-called
quantitative easing during their testimonies to lawmakers in
London last week. The Confederation of British Industry last
week said its retail-sales index rose in November.  The OBR, set up by Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to oversee Treasury forecasts, increased its prediction
for this year’s economic growth to 1.8 percent from 1.2 percent.
The Treasury’s fiscal watchdog cut the 2011 growth forecast to
2.1 percent from 2.3 percent.  Britain’s government will issue 165.2 billion pounds of
gilts in fiscal 2010/2011, from an earlier projection of 165
billion pounds, the London-based Debt Management Office said in
a statement today. The Treasury sold a record 227.6 billion
pounds of debt in the fiscal year that ended in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
