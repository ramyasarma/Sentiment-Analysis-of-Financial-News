Arrests of English and Welsh soccer
fans for disorderly conduct at matches in the 2009-2010 season
fell by 10 percent from the previous campaign, according to the
U.K. Home Office.  There were 3,391 arrests in the season, a decline of 395,
according to a statement e-mailed today. The figures include the
World Cup in South Africa, where no English or Welsh fans were
arrested, the Home Office said.  The U.K. has used banning orders for the last decade to
prevent supporters with criminal histories from attending
matches. Those bans increased to 3,248 in November from 3,180 12
months earlier. Ministers and police said the situation has
improved since 2000, when 950 British hooligans were expelled
from Belgium in one night during the European championships.  “There are many factors behind this and the greatest
credit must go to the fans,” Crime Prevention Minister James
Brokenshire said in the statement. “But I want to see them
continue to build on that good behaviour. We must also applaud
the work of police in making football a safer environment for
all.”  England is bidding to host the 2018 World Cup, and a
committee at FIFA, the sport’s governing body, will vote Dec. 2
on where the event will be held.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
