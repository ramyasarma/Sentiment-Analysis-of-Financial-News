The  U.S. Supreme Court  refused to
question a $27,750 award to music companies in a suit against a
woman who was 16 when she illegally downloaded 37 songs using a
file-sharing network.  The suit against Whitney Harper of San Antonio was one of
more than 30,000 filed by the recording industry against alleged
copyright infringers from 2003 to 2008. Most of the cases led to
settlements, and Harper’s was one of only a handful still being
fought in court.  In her Supreme Court appeal, Harper sought to reinstate a
trial judge’s conclusion that she was an “innocent infringer”
who should have to pay only $200 per song, rather than the $750
minimum that would otherwise apply under federal copyright law.  Harper said she believed that playing music through a file-
sharing network was akin to listening to an Internet radio
station.  A New Orleans-based federal appeals court said Harper’s
beliefs didn’t make her an innocent infringer because the record
companies had put copyright notices on compact discs that were
sold in stores.  Justice  Samuel Alito , alone among the justices, said he
would have scheduled arguments on the appeal, saying he
questioned the relevance of the notice placed on compact disc
cases.  “A person who downloads a digital music file generally
does not see any material object bearing a copyright notice,”
Alito wrote.  The companies that sued Harper included units of  Warner
Music Group Corp.,   Vivendi SA  and  Sony Corp.   The case is Harper v. Maverick Recording Company, 10-94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
