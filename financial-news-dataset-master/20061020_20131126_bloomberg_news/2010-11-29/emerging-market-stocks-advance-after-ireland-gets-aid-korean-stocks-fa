Stocks in eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa fell, sending the benchmark index to a two-month
low, as Europe’s bailout of Ireland failed to ease concern that
the region’s debt crisis will slow economic growth.  The  MSCI Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa Index 
declined 1.3 percent to 354.88 at 2:01 p.m. in London, extending
three straight weeks of losses. Turkey’s  ISE National 100 Index 
dropped more than 2 percent and the lira weakened. Hungary’s BUX
Index  plunged  more than 20 percent from its 2010 peak, poised to
become the first emerging-market stock gauge to enter a bear
market since global equities began falling this month.  Investors speculated an 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) aid
package for Ireland may not be enough to restore confidence in
indebted European nations including Portugal and Spain. The MSCI
EMEA index has retreated 8.4 percent from this year’s high on
Nov. 9 amid concern the region’s debt crisis will erode demand
for emerging-market assets.  “The fear is that this may be just a test run before the
more substantive issues of Portuguese and Spanish debt talks
have to begin,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Moscow-based
UralSib Financial Corp., said in an e-mailed note. “That
concern will hang over markets for months.”  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  of shares in 21 developing
nations was little changed at 1,080.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
