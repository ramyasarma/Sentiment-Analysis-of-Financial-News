England set Australia 297 to win the
series-opening Ashes cricket Test after unbeaten centuries by
Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott guided the touring team to 517-
1 in its second innings.  Cook made a career-best 235, while Trott scored 135 as they
shared a ground-record partnership of 329 runs. Captain Andrew
Strauss, who yesterday scored 110, declared the second innings
before the tea break on the final day.  There are 41 overs remaining in the match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
