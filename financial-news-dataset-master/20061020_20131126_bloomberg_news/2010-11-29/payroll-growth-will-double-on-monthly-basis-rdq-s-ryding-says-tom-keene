Payrolls in the U.S. are poised to
grow by about 200,000 a month, double the pace so far this year,
said  John Ryding  of RDQ Economics in New York.  “We’re really signaling a stronger jobs picture,” Ryding,
the firm’s chief economist and co-founder, said today in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  While the pace of job growth is “Not strong enough to make
major inroads in the unemployment rate,” he said, it “would be
quite welcome as another baby step along the road to a stronger
economic recovery.”  Employment increased by 145,000 workers this month after a
151,000 gain in October that marked the biggest advance since
May, according to the median forecast of 82 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News ahead of Labor Department data on Dec. 3.  The jobless rate was 9.6 percent for a fourth consecutive
month in November, according the survey median. It would be the
16th month of joblessness at 9.5 percent or higher, the longest
such stretch since records began in 1948. The worst recession
since the 1930s caused the loss of 8.4 million jobs.  Ryding cited improvement in claims for unemployment
benefits as evidence the job market is on the mend. Claims
declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week ended Nov. 20,
according to the Labor Department. The total number of people
receiving unemployment insurance decreased to the lowest in two
years, and those on extended payments also fell.  Lehman Crisis  “The four-week average is now down below the level it was
at when the Lehman crisis broke in September 2008,” he said.
The overall economy is “on a bit of an upswing here.”  Initial reports from the Thanksgiving holiday weekend
suggest U.S. consumers are boosting their spending, Ryding said.
About 212 million shoppers went to stores and websites over the
holiday weekend, on average spending $365.34, the National
Retail Federation said yesterday.  “The consumer is showing that they are willing to spend,
not at a spectacular pace,” Ryding said. “By all accounts, it
looks like we’re getting” close to 3 percent spending growth.  At the same time, small businesses have been reluctant to
invest and hire, partly because of concern that tax rates will
rise next year unless Congress extends reductions enacted under
President  George W. Bush , which expire Dec. 31.  “One other thing that would help is tax certainty,”
Ryding said. “We are therefore 33 days away from the end of the
year. And we do not know what the tax rates are going to be in
2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
