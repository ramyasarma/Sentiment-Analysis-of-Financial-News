U.K. stocks declined as an increase
in the cost of insuring the debt of Iberian countries outweighed
an 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) aid package for Ireland.  Resolution Ltd.  sank 3.1 percent as  JPMorgan Chase & Co .
initiated coverage of the buyout firm founded by Clive Cowdery
with an “underweight” rating.  Allied Irish Banks Plc  and  Bank
of Ireland Plc  surged in Ireland.  Gartmore Group Ltd.  rose 2.2
percent as the Financial Times reported that  Henderson Group Plc 
hired advisers to examine its options to buy the London-based
company.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  erased previous gains,
declining 0.4 percent to 5,645.80 at 11:07 a.m. in London. The
broader  FTSE All-Share Index  slid 0.4 percent today, while
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  gained 0.8 percent.  “The initial sigh of relief from the Irish aid package
faded - as it did with the announcement of aid seeking last week
- when looking at the details,” said Christian Weber, a senior
credit strategist at  UniCredit SpA  in Munich. He added that
“equities have done better than credit over the past weeks”
and “we are also nearing the year-end and people look to lock
profits in a low activity environment.”  European finance chiefs ended crisis talks on Ireland
yesterday by endorsing a Franco-German compromise on post-2013
rescues that means investors won’t automatically take losses to
share the cost with taxpayers as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
initially proposed, to the consternation of bond traders.  The cost of insuring debt of Spain and Portugal soared to
record high levels, according to CMA prices for credit-default
swaps. Contracts on Spain climbed 14 basis points to 336 while
Portugal rose 23 basis points to 524.  FTSE 100  The FTSE 100 is down 4 percent since reaching the highest
level in more than two-years on Nov. 5 amid concern the
sovereign-debt crisis will spread from Ireland to southern
Europe and speculation China will raise interest rates to tame
inflation.  Resolution plummeted 3.1 percent to 218.2 pence. JPMorgan
Chase initiated coverage of the stock with an “underweight”
rating. The brokerage said in a note that “the corporate
structure of Resolution (the value share, the management fees
and the other incentive fees) means that the shares deserve a
structural discount versus peers in our opinion.”  Shire Plc  ended a three day gain, falling 1.1 percent to
1,550 pence. Jefferies Group Inc. downgraded the Dublin-based
drug company to “hold” from “buy.”  Banking Shares  Allied Irish Banks surged 7.9 percent to 36.9 euro cents,
extending a 14 percent gain on Nov. 26, while Bank of Ireland
jumped 20 percent to 31.8 euro cents, the steepest increase
since May, after the government said the country’s two biggest
lenders will receive money to boost their core capital ratios,
which gauge financial strength.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  added 1 percent to 39.06
pence, after dropping 5.3 percent on Nov. 26.  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc  fell 1.5 percent to 60.9 pence after gaining as much
as 3 percent.  Gartmore Group, the U.K. fund manager that slumped earlier
this month after losing star money manager  Roger Guy , rose 2.2
percent to 105.3 pence. Henderson Global Investors has asked
advisers to examine the possibility of Henderson buying a
portion or all of rival Gartmore, the Financial Times reported
on its website on Nov. 26, citing unidentified people familiar
with the situation.  Norkom Group Plc  surged 13 percent to 1.23 euros, advancing
for a third day. The Irish maker of anti-fraud banking software
said it is in talks with a number of parties which may or may
not lead to an offer for the company. The talks are at a
“preliminary stage,” it said Nov. 26.  Unite Group Plc  increased 2.8 percent to 193.8 pence,
paring a 4.3 percent decline on Nov. 26. The company said it
sold 143.9 million pounds of assets to the Unite U.K. Student
Accommodation fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
