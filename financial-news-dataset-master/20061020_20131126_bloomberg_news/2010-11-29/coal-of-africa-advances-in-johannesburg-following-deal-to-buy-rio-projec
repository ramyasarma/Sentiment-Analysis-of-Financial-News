Coal of Africa Ltd. , a producer of
the fuel in South Africa, advanced the most in a week in
Johannesburg after agreeing to pay $75 million for a project in
the country partly owned by Rio Tinto Minerals Development Ltd.  Coal of Africa, based in Perth, Australia, rose 2.4
percent, the most since Nov. 18, to 8.40 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg. It will buy the Chapudi Coal Project in
Limpopo province from companies held by Rio Tinto Minerals and
Kwezi Mining (Pty) Ltd., according to a statement today.  “It’s a good quality asset, very good premium coking
coal,”  Mark Heyhoe , an analyst at Westhouse Securities Ltd. who
has a “buy” rating on Coal of Africa, said from London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
