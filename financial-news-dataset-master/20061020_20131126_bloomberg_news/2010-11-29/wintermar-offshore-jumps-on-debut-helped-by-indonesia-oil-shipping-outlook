PT Wintermar Offshore Marine , which
provides shipping services to the petroleum industry in Asia,
gained as much as 32 percent in its trading debut in Jakarta.  Jakarta-based  Wintermar  surged to as much as 500 rupiah a
share, before trading at 400 rupiah, or a 5.3 percent gain, at
11:07 a.m. local time, compared with a 0.7 percent drop on the
benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index .  Wintermar raised 342 billion rupiah ($38 million) selling
900 million new shares at 380 rupiah apiece in an initial
offering earlier this month to repay debt and help fund vessel
purchases.  The Indonesian shipping company is seeking to tap increased
local demand after the government barred vessels with foreign
flags from carrying cargo between the nation’s seaports. A
transport ministry  regulation  issued in November 2005 said that
for oil and gas transport, the rule took effect in January this
year.  Wintermar plans to allocate $100 million in capital
spending next year to buy 11 new vessels, Corporate Secretary
Pek Swan Layanto said. About 80 percent of the capex will be
funded from bank loans, the rest from IPO proceeds, she added.  “We’re adding more vessels to anticipate an increase in
demand from local oil and gas companies with the implementation
of the cabotage rules,” Layanto said, adding the company
currently owns 59 ships.  Wintermar expects net income to grow 35 percent to 45
percent next year from an estimated 100 billion rupiah this year,
Layanto said. Revenue may grow 30 percent from 650 billion
rupiah, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
