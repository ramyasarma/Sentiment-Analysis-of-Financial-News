Peak Sport Products Ltd ., the
Chinese sportswear maker that sponsors 12 U.S. National
Basketball Association players, will increase the size of its
stores while targeting a net increase of 800 stores next year.  The sportswear company endorsed by the Phoenix Suns’  Jason Richardson  will close some of its smaller stores, Chief
Financial Officer  Denis Tsoi  said in an interview in Guangzhou.
 Peak Sport , with 7,009 stores in China as of Sept. 30, plans to
open 1,000 outlets by the end of the year, he said.  Peak Sport, which has  gained  28 percent in Hong Kong
trading this year, or six times faster than the benchmark Hang
Seng Index, is in talks to increase retail outlets in the U.S.,
Tsoi said. The company plans to boost distribution in the
world’s biggest economy, where it’s building a research and
development center, he said.  Same-store sales will grow between 12 percent to 15
percent in the fourth quarter and in 2011, Tsoi predicted. Peak
Sport derives 89 percent of  sales  from China, where  retail
sales growth  has averaged 18.3 percent in the first 10 months
of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Asia is giving us the strongest growth,” Tsoi said at a
Nov. 26 interview during a conference organized by Samsung
Securities Co. in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. Sales
in Asia excluding China were 2.9 percent of its total last year.  Same-store or comparable sales strip out the effect of
newly opened or closed outlets.  Peak Sport  rose 1.1 percent to HK$5.50 at the 12:30 p.m.
