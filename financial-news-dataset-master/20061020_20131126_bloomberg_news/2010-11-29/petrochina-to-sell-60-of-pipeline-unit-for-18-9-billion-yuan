PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest
oil producer, is seeking a state-owned buyer that will pay 18.9
billion yuan ($2.8 billion) for its 60 percent stake in a
natural gas pipeline operator in Beijing.  The buyer of the PetroChina Beijing Natural Gas Pipeline
Co. stake must be state-owned to ensure the unit’s “long-term
healthy development,” PetroChina said in a statement to the
China Beijing Equity Exchange today.  PetroChina Beijing Natural Gas was established in 1991 by
PetroChina’s parent  China National Petroleum Corp.  and the
Beijing municipal government. It was set up to build pipelines
to transport gas from the northwestern province of Shaanxi to
the Chinese capital, according to the city government. The
capital’s gas demand may rise 17 percent this year, the Beijing
government said last month.  The buyer must have the ability to provide “sufficient”
natural gas supplies to the pipeline operator, Beijing-based
 PetroChina  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
