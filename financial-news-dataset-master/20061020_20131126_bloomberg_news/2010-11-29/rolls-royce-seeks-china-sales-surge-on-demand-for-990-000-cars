Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. ,
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s luxury nameplate, plans to
sell 800 cars in China in 2011 as it aims to raise sales
eightfold in two years in the world’s largest auto market.  The automaker delivered almost 500 cars in China in the
first 10 months of 2010, compared with about 100 for the whole
of last year,  Paul Harris , the company’s Asia Pacific regional
director, said in an interview on Nov. 26. Rolls-Royce includes
Hong Kong in its China sales.  The exclusive marque, which competes with  Volkswagen
AG ’s Bentley and  Daimler AG ’s Maybach, is selling more
of its Phantom and Ghost sedans in China as rising incomes in
the world’s fastest growing major economy boost sales of luxury
cars. China has 875,000 millionaires, 6.1 percent more than last
year, according to a report in April by the Shanghai-based  Hurun
Research Institute .  “The Chinese market in general is showing only one
direction,” Harris said. “That’s exceptional growth, and it’s
going to be ongoing for quite a while.”  A Rolls-Royce Phantom starts at 6.6 million yuan ($990,000)
and buyers pay 4.1 million yuan for a Ghost in China where
consumers pay higher taxes on imported luxury models. In the
U.S., the Phantom starts at $380,000.  BMW  fell 2.6 percent to 57.74 euros in Frankfurt trading
yesterday as Germany’s benchmark DAX Index closed 2.2 percent
lower. The stock is up 82 percent this year.  Ghost Demand  Munich-based BMW bought the rights to Rolls-Royce cars for
45 million pounds ($70 million) in 1998, and began building them
at a new factory in 2003.  China will become Rolls-Royce’s biggest market, surpassing
the U.S., as early as next year as the Ghost spurs demand for
its cars, Singapore-based Harris said. The company sold about a
third of its cars in the U.S. in 2009.  Rolls-Royce may add as many as four more dealers in China
by the middle of next year, in second-tier cities such as
Tianjin and Wuhan, he said. The Goodwood, England-based
carmaker, headed by Chief Executive Officer  Torsten Mueller- Oetvoes , currently has eight dealerships in the nation.  The latest Ghost model, introduced in December, has boosted
growth for the exclusive marque after the financial crisis
depressed sales 17 percent in 2009. Rolls-Royce delivered 2,007
cars through October worldwide, already surpassing the record
since BMW took over of 1,212 in 2008, and its 1,002 deliveries
last year.  Import Duties  The  Phantom  comes with a 6.75 liter engine and soft leather
upholstery as standard. An extended wheelbase version of the
Phantom costs 8.2 million yuan, the company said.  Imported luxury cars cost more in China than in countries
such as the U.S. as the vehicles are subject to high import
duties and consumption taxes. An imported car with an engine
bigger than 4.0 liters will face an import duty of 25 percent,
value-added taxes of 17 percent, and a consumption tax of 40
percent, according to researcher  J.D. Power & Associates .  Chinese customers ordering a Phantom now will have to wait
until late May next year to receive their cars, Harris said.  “It’s a story of success for Chinese entrepreneurial
businesses, the Chinese entrepreneur works hard and wants to
reward himself for a job well done,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
