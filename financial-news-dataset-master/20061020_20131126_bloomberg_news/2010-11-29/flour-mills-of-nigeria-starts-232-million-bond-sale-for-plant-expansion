(Correct currency conversion in headline, first paragraph.)  Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc , which
processes grain and sells cement, started accepting orders for
its sale of 35 billion naira ($232 million) of five-year bonds
as part of a 70 billion-naira debt-sale program.  The coupon rate on the notes is “conservatively projected
at 11 percent per annum although the company believes it could
achieve more favorable terms given current market conditions,”
Flour Mills said in a prospectus e-mailed today by Lagos-based
 Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc , one of the placing agents in the sale.
The book-building process closes on Dec. 2, with UBA Capital
Ltd. acting as the lead bookrunner on the sale while  Guaranty
Trust Bank Plc  and Zenith Capital Ltd. are joint issuing houses.  The funds will be used to refinance existing loans with
Zenith Bank Plc, expand the company’s milling business and
invest in a sugar refinery, both of which are located in the
Apapa area of Lagos, it said.  The bonds are rated A at Agusto & Co., a Lagos-based
company. That’s the third-highest rating on Agusto’s  rating
scale . Flour Mills doesn’t have ratings from Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Flour Mills’ stock gained 1.5 percent to close at 70 naira
by 12:30 p.m. on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in Lagos. The stock
has gained 114 percent this year, compared with 18 percent by
the benchmark  All Share index  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
