China’s government will hold an
annual economic conference in Beijing late next week to set
guidelines for  monetary  and fiscal policy in 2011, two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  Officials may discuss lending and inflation targets at the
Dec. 10-12 meeting, one of the people said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. State Council and central bank press
officers declined to comment.  China’s central bank has said that it will guide monetary
conditions back to “normal” after unprecedented lending drove
the nation’s economic recovery since 2008. After raising
interest rates in October, officials have threatened to impose
price controls and pledged to use tools such as sales of state
food reserves to counter the  fastest inflation  in 25 months.  President  Hu Jintao  and Premier  Wen Jiabao , government
officials and some executives of state-owned enterprises
attended last year’s meeting.  The government’s shift away from policies adopted to
counter the global financial crisis has included raising rates,
scrapping a currency peg, and boosting banks’ reserve
requirements. At the same time, policy makers have continued to
describe monetary policy as “moderately loose” and the
nation’s fiscal stance as “proactive.”  Credit Growth  Domestic banks extended about 6.9 trillion yuan ($1
trillion) of  new loans  in the 10 months through October,
according to central bank data. In addition, lenders have made
600 billion yuan of new loans this month, the 21st Century
Business Herald reported Nov. 23. The figures suggest that the
government’s full-year target of 7.5 trillion yuan may be
breached.  Overall credit growth should be curtailed to 15 percent
next year from an estimated 18.8 percent this year,  Xia Bin , an
academic adviser to the People’s Bank of China, said Nov. 25.  Officials at the work meeting may set a higher inflation
target of 4 percent for 2011, up from this year’s 3 percent, and
shift to describing monetary policy as “prudent,” the China
Business News reported Nov. 24, citing an unidentified person
who has consulted on policy. In October,  inflation  was a more-
than-estimated 4.4 percent.  -- Luo Jun ,  Li Yanping , with assistance from  Zhang Dingmin  in
