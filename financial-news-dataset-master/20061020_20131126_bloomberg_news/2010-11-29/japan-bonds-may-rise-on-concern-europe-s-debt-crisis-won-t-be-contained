Japan’s five-year notes rose as data
showed the nation’s industrial production dropped for a fifth
month and the jobless rate increased, adding to signs an
economic recovery is losing momentum.  Five-year Japanese government bond  yields  retreated from a
the highest since May amid concern an 85 billion-euro ($111.6
billion) bailout for Ireland won’t keep Europe’s debt crisis
from spreading, spurring demand for safer assets. Japan’s 10-
year yields rose to a 12-week high on speculation investors
reduced their debt holdings to prepare for tomorrow’s auction of
10-year securities. The spread in  yield  between five- and 10-
year debt increased to the widest level in nine weeks.  Japan’s factory output data “confirmed a rapid slowdown in
the economy toward year-end, which is not a sell factor for
bonds,” said Akito Fukunaga, chief rates strategist in Tokyo at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain’s biggest government-
owned bank. “As Europe’s contagion risks get bigger, that could
prompt flight to quality. JGBs may be supported given their
yields are at an attractive level.”  The yield on the 0.3 percent note due September 2015 fell
1.5 basis points, or 0.015 percentage point, to 0.445 percent at
the 11:05 a.m. break in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The price rose 0.07
yen to 99.318 yen. Five-year yields reached 0.47 percent
yesterday, the highest since May 12.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.09 to
140.76 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contracts touched 140.41
yesterday, the lowest since June 17.  Ten-year yields gained 1.5 basis points to 1.19 percent,
matching the highest since Sept. 6. They have risen 27 basis
points this month, the biggest monthly advance since April 2008.  Factory Output  Japan’s factory output fell 1.8 percent in October after
dropping 1.6 percent in September, the government reported
today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was a 3.2 percent drop. The nation’s jobless rate climbed
to 5.1 percent in October from 5 percent in September, another
report showed.  Demand for bonds was limited before the Ministry of Finance
sells 2.2 trillion yen ($26.1 billion) of 10-year bonds
tomorrow. The prior 10-year sale on Nov. 2 drew bids worth 3.91
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.85 at the October sale.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds in case prices
decline before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  “Investors find it hard to make big moves before
tomorrow’s 10-year sale, and that’s limiting upward momentum”
for bonds, said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in Tokyo at
Okasan Securities Co. “The current yield level suggests the
coupon for the securities will be 1.2 percent.”  The spread in yield between five- and 10- year debt
expanded to 74 basis points today, the widest level since Sept.
