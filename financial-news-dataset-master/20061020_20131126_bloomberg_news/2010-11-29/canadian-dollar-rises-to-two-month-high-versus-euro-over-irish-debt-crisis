Canada’s dollar strengthened versus
the greenback as crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, climbed
to a two-week high.  The loonie, as the currency is also known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, climbed to a two-month high
versus the euro as an Irish bailout package failed to ease
concern that Europe’s debt crisis will spread. The Canadian
dollar outperformed the currencies of other commodity exporters
such as Norway and Australia.  “The Canadian dollar strength is paired up with oil
today,” said  Darren Richardson , senior corporate dealer in
Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online foreign-exchange
dealer. “There’s very good performance in oil.”  Canada’s currency gained 0.3 percent to C$1.0181 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0213 on Nov. 26. The
loonie appreciated 1.2 percent to C$1.3363 per euro, from
C$1.3523, after touching C$1.3355, the strongest level since
Sept. 16. The Canadian dollar has appreciated 0.1 percent
against the greenback in November, headed for what would be a
third consecutive monthly gain, the longest winning streak since
the three months ended May 2009.  January futures on crude oil rallied 2.5 percent to $85.89
a barrel. The price climbed as high as $85.90, the strongest
intraday level since Nov. 12.  European governments sought to quell market turmoil
menacing the euro, handing Ireland an 85 billion euro ($113
billion) aid package and diluting proposals to force bondholders
to bear some cost of future bailouts. The cost of insuring debt
from Spain and Portugal soared to record highs as concern
mounted that the nations may need to be bailed out.  ‘Relatively Robust’  “We’ve got issues of financial instability not just in
Ireland but in a number of other nations, and the Canadian
financial system remains relatively robust,” said  David Watt ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit in Toronto.  The Aussie fell 0.2 percent to 96.31 U.S. cents against the
greenback, while Norway’s krone traded at 6.1561. The euro
dropped 0.9 percent to $1.3125.  “The attractiveness of Canadian assets has been driving
very strong support of portfolio flows into the country,” said
 Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto. “A lot of it is a continuation of concern and malaise
over what’s going on in the euro zone.”  The Bank of Canada left its benchmark overnight rate
unchanged at 1 percent last month after three successive
increases starting in June. Policy makers are next scheduled to
decide on borrowing costs Dec. 7.  Labor Market  Employment in  Canada  rose by a net 19,800 in November after
a gain of 3,000 in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The report
from Statistics Canada is due Dec. 3.  “There could be some upside risk to the employment number
this week,” said  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign exchange
at Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “If that happens, that would
certainly put the Bank of Canada on the radar in terms of rate
hikes.”  Canadian government bonds rose, with the yield on 10-year
debt dropping three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
3.08 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in
June 2020 increased 27 cents to C$103.45.  The  current account deficit  widened to a record in the
third quarter, with payments sent abroad exceeding receipts from
outside Canada by C$17.5 billion ($17.2 billion), Statistics
Canada said today.  Separate figures showed the industrial product price index
rose 0.5 percent in October, while the gauge of raw materials
advanced 1.7 percent. Both gains were bigger than the median
forecasts in Bloomberg News surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
