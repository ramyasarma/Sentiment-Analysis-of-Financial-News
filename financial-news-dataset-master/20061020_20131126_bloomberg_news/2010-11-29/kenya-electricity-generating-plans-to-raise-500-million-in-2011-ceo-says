Kenya Electricity Generating Co.,
the East African nation’s biggest power producer, plans to raise
about $500 million next year to bolster its generating capacity,
Chief Executive Officer Edward Njoroge said.  “This year we have raised, mainly from the development-
finance institutions, about $1 billion,” Njoroge said in an
interview in Cape Town today. “Any money that we are raising
for next year” will be used for projects that are due to come
on stream in 2015.  Kengen, as the utility is known, wants to partake in a
government-backed initiative to build a nuclear power plant in
Kenya by 2022, Njoroge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
