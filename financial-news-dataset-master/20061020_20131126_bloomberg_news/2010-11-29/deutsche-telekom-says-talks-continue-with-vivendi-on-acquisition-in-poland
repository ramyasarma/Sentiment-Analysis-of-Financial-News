Deutsche Telekom AG  said it’s still
negotiating with Vivendi SA on the German phone company’s plan
to buy full control of Polish mobile-phone operator Polska
Telefonia Cyfrowa Sp. z o.o.  The amount being negotiated includes a second payment for
the 48 percent stake Deutsche Telekom acquired in PTC in 2006 as
well as the purchase of the remaining 3 percent of outstanding
PTC stock owned by two holding companies controlled by Poland’s
Elektrim SA and Vivendi, said  Anna Bischof , a spokeswoman for
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom. She declined to disclose a
possible price.  Deutsche Telekom and Paris-based  Vivendi  are close to
completing an agreement on PTC, German magazine Der Spiegel
reported, citing unidentified people close to the companies.
Deutsche Telekom wants to spend more than 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) on the purchase of the shares, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
