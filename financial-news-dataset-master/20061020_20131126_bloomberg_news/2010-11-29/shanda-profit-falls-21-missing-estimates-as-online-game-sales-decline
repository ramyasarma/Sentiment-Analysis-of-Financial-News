Shanda Games Ltd. , China’s second-
biggest operator of online games, said third-quarter profit fell
21 percent after the introduction of new titles and upgrades
failed to lift revenue.  Net income dropped to 289 million yuan ($43.1 million),
from 366.6 million yuan, a year earlier, Shanda Games said in a
statement today. This compares with the 328.3 million yuan
average of seven analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shanda posted its second-straight drop in quarterly sales
as the Shanghai-based company struggled to gain players for
older games such as “Mir 2” and “World of Legend.” Chinese
rivals including  Tencent Holding Ltd.  and  NetEase.com Inc.  are
boosting spending to offer new titles in the world’s biggest
Internet market.  Sales fell 14 percent to 1.1 billion yuan, Shanda said.
This followed a 4 percent drop in second-quarter revenue,
according to the company’s earnings report in September.  Shanda’s ADRs rose 0.5 percent to $5.69 in New York trading
today before the announcement. The stock has declined 44 percent
this year, compared with the 2 percent gain in the Hong Kong-
traded shares of Tencent, the biggest online game operator in
China.  In July, Shanda rolled out “Dragon Nest,” a multi player
role-playing game with three-dimensional graphics, after
unveiling expansion packs for “Mir 2” in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
