Former National Football League
running backs  Curtis Martin ,  Jerome Bettis  and  Marshall Faulk 
are among 26 semifinalists for the  Pro Football Hall of Fame  in
their first year of eligibility.  The Hall of Fame’s selection committee chose the
semifinalists for the Class of 2011 from a list of 114
preliminary nominees.  Deion Sanders , who played 17 NFL seasons
as a cornerback and kick returner, was also selected as a
semifinalist in his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility.  Martin, 37, ranks fourth in NFL history with 14,101 rushing
yards, trailing only  Emmitt Smith ,  Walter Payton  and  Barry Sanders , all of whom are in the Hall of Fame.  Martin spent eight of his 11 seasons with the New York Jets
and retired in 2005.  Bettis, 38, is the league’s fifth-leading rusher with
13,662 yards and won a Super Bowl title with the Pittsburgh
Steelers during his last NFL season in 2005. He played 10 of his
13 seasons in Pittsburgh.  Faulk, 37, won the NFL’s Most Valuable Player Award in 2000
and his 136 touchdowns are seventh-most in league history. He
rushed for 12,279 yards in 12 seasons and won a Super Bowl ring
with the St. Louis Rams after the 1999 season.  Former San Francisco 49ers owner  Edward DeBartolo , Jr. and
NFL Films founder  Ed Sabol  -- both of whom were previously
eligible -- are also semifinalists for the first time.  The group will be reduced to 15 finalists during a vote in
January. The 2011 Hall of Fame class, which will include four to
seven new members, will be determined Feb. 5, the day before the
Super Bowl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
