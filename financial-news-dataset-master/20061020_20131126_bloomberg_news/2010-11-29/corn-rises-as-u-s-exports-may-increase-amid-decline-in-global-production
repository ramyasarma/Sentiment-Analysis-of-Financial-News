Corn rose on speculation that
reduced global grain production will boost demand for supplies
from the U.S., the biggest exporter.  Russia’s agricultural regulator Rosselkhoznadzor said last
week the country is seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of corn
from Argentina. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today said that he
has contacted other nations to reserve supplies after Russia’s
worst drought in at least 50 years reduced output. U.S.
exporters sold 120,000 tons to Mexico, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today.  “Talk of Russia seeking Argentina corn will offer
support,” said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “We will need to
confirm Argentina sales to Russia to sustain rallies.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.25 cent to close at
$5.5325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has surged 48 percent since the end of June, reaching a
26-month high of $6.175 on Nov. 9, as adverse weather reduced
the size of the U.S. crop.  Combined global production of feed grains including corn,
sorghum and barley will fall 2.1 percent to 1.085 billion tons
in the marketing year that began Oct. 1, reducing reserve
inventories before next year’s harvest by 20 percent, the USDA
said earlier this month.  Argentina, the world’s second-biggest corn shipper, will
authorize the export of 5 million tons from the crop now being
planted, starting Feb. 15, the national agricultural exports
agency said Nov. 24.  Russia Imports  Russia may import 500,000 tons of feed barley from the
European Union before July, the Grain Producers’ Union said Nov.
26. The country may also import 2 million tons of corn from
Ukraine and 500,000 tons of barley from Kazakhstan, Sergei
Shakhovets, the head of analytics at the Moscow-based union,
said last week.  The country will have a shortfall of 2.5 million to 3
million tons of feed by March or April and will probably need
imports to bridge the gap, Shakhovets said. Russia may need to
import as much as 5 million tons of grain in the year that ends
June 30, he said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower. Corn is the
country’s biggest crop, valued at $48.6 billion in 2009,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
