Gold may fall to $1,315 an ounce in
the coming weeks as a head-and-shoulders pattern develops,
indicating a 3.2 percent decline, according to technical
analysis by Dolmen Stockbrokers.  The attached chart shows gold’s rally stalled last week
between the 50 percent and 61.8 percent retracement levels of
the metal’s drop from Nov. 9 to Nov. 16, according to so-called
Fibonacci analysis. The second attached chart shows bullion is
forming a head-and-shoulders pattern and may fall toward $1,315,
a level identified by one of the pattern’s troughs.  “Bearish momentum divergence and a potential head and
shoulders reversal pattern point towards lower prices over the
coming weeks with main neckline support at $1,315,” John
Tracey, a technical analyst at Dolmen Stockbrokers in Dublin,
wrote in a report today.  A head-and-shoulders pattern is formed by three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline connecting the base of the three peaks, also a
support level, may signal the reversal of a trend. A fall below
the $1,315 level “would see an accelerated sell off towards
$1,227 major support,” Tracey said.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,357.92 an ounce at
12:20 p.m. in London. Prices reached a record $1,424.60 on Nov.
9 and are up 24 percent this year. The metal has outperformed
global equities, U.S. Treasuries, and most industrial metals.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
