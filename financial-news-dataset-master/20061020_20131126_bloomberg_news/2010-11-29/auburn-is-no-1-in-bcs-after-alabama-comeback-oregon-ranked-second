Auburn University moved past the
University of Oregon for the top spot in college football’s Bowl
Championship Series rankings after rallying from a 24-point
deficit to beat defending champion Alabama 28-27.      Auburn (12-0) has a .9779 rating out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, while Oregon (11-0) is at .9777. Texas Christian
University (12-0) is third at .917.   While TCU has finished its regular-season schedule, Auburn
next plays South Carolina on Dec. 4 in the Southeastern
Conference championship game and Oregon visits Oregon State the
same day. The final BCS standings are released Dec. 5 and the
teams finishing No. 1 and No. 2 will play for the national
championship on Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona.   The BCS is determined using the USA Today coaches’ poll,
the Harris Interactive poll and six computer rankings.   Stanford (11-1) is the BCS’s highest-ranked one-loss team
at fourth, followed by Wisconsin (11-1), Ohio State (11-1),
Arkansas (10-2) and Michigan State (11-1). Boise State fell to
11th from fourth after a 34-31 overtime loss to Nevada that
ended the Broncos’ chances of playing for the national title.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
