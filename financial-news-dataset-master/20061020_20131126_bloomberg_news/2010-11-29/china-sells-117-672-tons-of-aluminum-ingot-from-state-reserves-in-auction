China sold all the aluminum ingots
it offered from the state reserve at below market prices,
according to the result of a tender posted today on the website
of the National Development and Reform Commission.  A total of 117,671 metric tons were sold at an average
price of 15,395 yuan ($2,308) a ton through public auctions on
Nov. 23-24, said the State Bureau of Material Reserve, which is
a department of the commission. The highest price was 16,000
yuan and the lowest 15,150 yuan, it said.  This was the second auction of aluminum the agency offered
this month, having previously sold 95,767 tons. China has
already sold zinc, lead, sugar, cotton, corn, paper pulp, and
magnesium, from state inventories this year in an effort to ease
shortages and curb price gains.  “The result is in line with our expectation, and similar
to the last tender,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at Cofco Futures
Co., said by phone from Beijing. “Whether there will be further
sales depends on market prices.”  China authorities are easing power limits on aluminum
producers, which may lead to plant restarts as early as next
month, said Beijing-based analyst Wan Ling at CRU International
Ltd. on Nov. 25. In Henan, the country’s largest aluminum
producing region, conditions improved after Nov. 10, she said,
adding the energy cuts could still trim the country’s output by
300,000 tons this year.  Aluminum traded on Changjiang, Shanghai’s largest
nonferrous metals market, was quoted from 16,030 yuan to 16,070
yuan a ton when the tender was scheduled to take place, down
from around 16,150 yuan at the beginning of this month.  The world’s largest consumer is estimated to have a 350,000
ton surplus this year, down from an earlier forecast of 800,000
tons, said Li Yang, an analyst at researcher Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co., on Oct. 27.  Metal for delivery in three months traded on the London
Metal Exchange gained 0.6 percent to $2,284 a ton at 2:08 p.m.
in Shanghai. Aluminum on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained
0.4 percent to 16,400 yuan a ton at the same time.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Matthew Oakley.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
