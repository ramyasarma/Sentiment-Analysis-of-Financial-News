What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on concern that dry weather
damaged U.S. crops and rain hurt yields and the quality of grain
in Australia, said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that China will increase purchases from
the U.S. to restock government inventories, Grow said. Soybean-
meal futures may open steady to $1 lower per 2,000 pounds, and
soybean oil is expected to open up 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that Russia may purchase grain
from Argentina, increasing demand for U.S. supplies from other
importers, Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
