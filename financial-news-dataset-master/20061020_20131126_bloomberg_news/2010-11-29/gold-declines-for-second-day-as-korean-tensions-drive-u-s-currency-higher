Gold declined for a second day as
military and political tensions on the Korean peninsula drove
the dollar to a two-month high, eroding demand for the metal.  Immediate-delivery gold fell as much as 0.8 percent to
$1,353.30 an ounce and was at $1,361.85 at 2:47 p.m. in Tokyo.
Bullion has gained 24 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,424.60 an ounce on Nov. 9. Gold for February delivery dropped
0.2 percent to $1,362.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  South Korea resisted China’s call to resume six-party talks
with North Korea, as its navy began maneuvers with U.S. warships
amid threats of a “merciless” response by the North. North
Korea on Nov. 23 shelled a South Korean fishing community and
military base, killing four people.  “Given geopolitical risks on the Korean peninsula,
speculators prefer to put money into the dollar rather than a
traditional safe haven like gold,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at Tokyo-based broker Fujitomi Co.  U.S. and South Korean warships led by the aircraft carrier
USS George Washington have begun four days of drills in the
region. North Korea “will deal a merciless military counter-
attack at any provocative act of intruding into its territorial
waters,” according to a Rodong newspaper commentary carried
yesterday by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.  Dollar Gains  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency’s value against
six counterparts, rose as much as 0.4 percent to 80.652, the
highest since Sept. 21. The dollar gained as much as 0.5 percent
against the euro after European Central Bank council member
Christian Noyer said monetary easing creates the potential for
global imbalances.  European finance chiefs ended crisis talks in Brussels
yesterday, handing Ireland an 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) aid
package amid speculation that Portugal and perhaps even Spain
will require external support.  In China, the Shanghai Futures Exchange will increase
margins on gold, copper and aluminum after the market closes
today as the country moves to curb speculation and restrain
quickening inflation.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell to 2,083.18
metric tons as of Nov. 26 from 2,085.08 on Nov. 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a
record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14. Silver holdings declined to
14,770.30 tons on Nov. 26 from 14,930.29 tons, the highest
amount since at least February, data from four providers show.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.3 percent to $26.64 an
ounce after losing 3.2 percent on Nov. 26. The price reached
$29.36 an ounce on Nov. 9, the highest level since March 1980.  Palladium dropped 1.1 percent to $673 an ounce, while
platinum lost 0.2 percent to $1,643.50 an ounce. Both metals are
used in jewelry and pollution-control devices for cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
