U.S. stocks trimmed losses as banks
rallied and technology companies pared earlier declines, helping
the market recover from an early slide triggered by concern
Europe’s debt crisis will spread.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.5 percent to
1,183.47 at 2:33 p.m. in New York after slumping as much as 1.3
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.13
points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,017.87, trimming a 163-point
slide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
