Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
said homosexuals should be arrested because he thinks same-sex
relationships are unnatural, the Daily Nation reported.  Opinions among some people that Kenya’s new constitution
legalizes homosexuality aren’t correct, the Nairobi-based
 newspaper  cited Odinga as telling supporters in his
constituency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
