Australia’s dollar fell to the
lowest level in almost eight weeks against the greenback on
concern that conflict in Korea will escalate and an aid package
for Ireland won’t resolve Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The New Zealand dollar touched a one-month low versus its
U.S. counterpart as investors’ appetite for currencies linked to
global growth cooled. The Aussie also weakened as government
data showed business profits in the South Pacific nation
unexpectedly dropped in the third quarter.  “People don’t want to keep buying the Aussie due to the
Korean situation, as it is not only a commodity currency but
also an Asian currency,” said  Marito Ueda , senior marketing
director at FX Prime Corp., a foreign-exchange margin company in
Tokyo.  Australia’s currency fell 0.5 percent to 95.95 U.S. cents
at 1:06 p.m. in New York, from 96.45 cents on Nov. 26. The
currency touched 95.67 cents, the lowest since Oct. 5. It
declined 0.3 percent to 80.91 yen, from 81.12 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, dropped 0.7
percent to 74.49 U.S. cents, from 74.99 cents, and reached 74.29
cents, the lowest level since Oct. 27. The kiwi fell 0.4 percent
to 62.83 yen, from 63.06.  The Aussie and kiwi declined against most of their major
counterparts as global stocks dropped when an 85 billion-euro
($113 billion) international rescue for Ireland failed to ease
concern Europe’s most-indebted nations will need further aid.
The MSCI World Index of equities fell 1.1 percent.  South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak  vowed to make North
Korea pay for military attacks on a disputed island as China
sought talks to defuse the tension.  Australian business profits had the first quarterly decline
in a year. Gross operating profits fell 1.5 percent from the
previous quarter, the government said today. That compares with
the median forecast for a 4 percent gain in a Bloomberg News
survey of 18 economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
