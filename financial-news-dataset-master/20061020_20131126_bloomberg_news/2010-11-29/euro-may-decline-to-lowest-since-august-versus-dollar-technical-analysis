The euro may fall to the lowest
level in more than three months against the dollar as technical
indicators signal it’s locked in a downtrend, according to
Gaitame.Com Research Institute Ltd.  Europe’s currency dropped below $1.3363 last week, which
represents a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
currency’s advance from $1.1877 on June 7 to $1.4282 on Nov. 4.
The currency has failed to rebound above that level, indicating
that its gains are likely to be capped, said  Takuya Kawabata , a
researcher at the unit of Japan’s largest foreign-exchange
margin company in Tokyo.  “The 38.2 percent line will probably become resistance,”
Kawabata said in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday.
“The euro continues to be in a downtrend.”  The euro dropped yesterday below the 200-day moving average
around $1.3130 and touched $1.3064 below the 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement at $1.3080.  Investors may test the levels of $1.2796 and $1.2588,
Kawabata said. The first level is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement, the second level is the euro’s low on Aug. 24.
The last time the euro traded weaker than $1.2588 was July 13.  The euro traded at $1.3116 as of 7:54 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3125 in New York yesterday.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates a currency
may move to the next level. Resistance refers to an area where
sell orders may be clustered. Support is an area where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a currency.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
