UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest
insurer in the U.S. by sales, forecast lower 2011  profit  after
saying in October its earnings would be hurt by rising medical
costs and the U.S. health-care overhaul.  The company expects 2011 adjusted earnings of $3.50 to
$3.70 a share, the Minnetonka, Minnesota-based  insurer  said
today in a statement. That would be down from the $3.85 to $3.95
it estimated for 2010 on Oct. 19 and again today. For 2011, the
average estimate by 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $3.67.  Stephen Hemsley , UnitedHealth’s chief executive officer,
said during an investor call on Oct. 19 that earnings may
decline because of a new U.S. rule that would force insurers to
spend more money on patient care.  Ana Gupte , an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, said UnitedHealth’s
forecast today, its first for 2011, was “conservative.”  “The company is typically very conservative on initial
guidance and gives itself substantial room to ‘beat and raise’
as the year progresses,” Gupte said today in an e-mail. “I
would take this as good news.”  UnitedHealth’s forecast reflects the early effect of this
year’s health-care overhaul law, as well as an anticipated
slowdown in patient volumes, Gupte said.  UnitedHealth  rose  71 cents, or 2 percent, to $36.59 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
increased  24 percent  in the 12 months through today.  The Department of Health and Human Services issued rules on
Nov. 22 that compel insurers to spend from 80 to 85 percent of
premiums on medical care. United Health spent 80.1 percent in
the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
