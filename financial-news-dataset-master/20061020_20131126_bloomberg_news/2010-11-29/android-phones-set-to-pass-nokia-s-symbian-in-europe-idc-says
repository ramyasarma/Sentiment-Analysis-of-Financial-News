Google Inc. ’s Android software will
be Europe’s top smartphone platform next year, according to
researcher IDC.  Android phones accounted for 23 percent of western Europe
shipments in the third quarter, behind  Nokia Oyj ’s Symbian and
 Apple Inc. ’s iPhone platforms, IDC analyst  Francisco Jeronimo 
said in an interview. Android is set to pass Symbian and iPhone
in the region, he said, adding that it is already second to
Symbian worldwide.  Nine-month sales of Android devices in Western Europe were
led by  HTC Corp.  with 39 percent of shipments, followed by Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications AB with 27 percent and  Samsung
Electronics Co.  with 14 percent, Jeronimo said. Samsung is
gaining following the launch of the Galaxy S in the second half,
he said.  “The iPhone was last year’s hot device and now people are
looking for something different,” said Jeronimo, who is based
in London. The Galaxy S is seen as offering similar feel,
function, and third-party applications to an iPhone for a lower
price, he said.  Nokia shipped its new flagship N8 handset at the end of the
third quarter, giving customers a fast touchscreen with revamped
Symbian software to compete with the iPhone and Android. Sony
Ericsson and other companies that sold Symbian smartphones in
Europe have switched to Android on new models, leaving Nokia in
control of Symbian.  Smartphones are expected to account for 49 percent of
western Europe handset shipments in 2011, up from 35 percent
forecast for this year, Jeronimo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
