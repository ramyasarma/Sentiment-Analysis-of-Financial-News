Netflix Inc. , the online and DVD film
rental service, named  David Wells  to replace Chief Financial
Officer  Barry McCarthy . The shares fell in extended trading.  Wells, who served most recently as vice president of
financial planning and analysis, will take on the new role as of
Dec. 10, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said today in a
statement. McCarthy is leaving to explore positions outside the
company, Netflix said.  Wells becomes CFO as Netflix is working to secure more
content for its online streaming business. Last month, the
company introduced its first Internet-only subscription in the
U.S. at $7.99 a month. As of Sept. 30, two-thirds of the
company’s 16.9 million subscribers had used its Web service.  Netflix dropped $6.85, or 3.6 percent, to $182.96 at 5:19
p.m. in extended trading. The shares, which have more than
tripled this year,  fell  $3.66 to $189.81 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  McCarthy’s departure will not affect negotiations with
content suppliers,  Steve Swasey , a Netflix spokesman, said in a
telephone interview today. McCarthy had planned to step down at
the end of 2004 and decided to stay longer to help the company
expand its business and fend off competitors, Swasey said.  The company’s contract, signed in 2008 with Liberty Media
Corp.-owned Starz, lets it offer films from Sony Corp. and
 Walt Disney Co.   To contact the reporters on this story:
