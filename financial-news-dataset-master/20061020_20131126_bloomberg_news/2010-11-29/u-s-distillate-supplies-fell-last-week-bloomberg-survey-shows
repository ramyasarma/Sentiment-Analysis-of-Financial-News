U.S. distillate fuel inventories
probably fell for a 10th week as consumption increased, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles  of distillates, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, dropped 1.1 million barrels in the seven days
ended Nov. 26 from 158.3 million, according to the median of 11
analyst  estimates  before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Ten of the respondents forecast a decrease and one said there
was an increase.  “Distillate stocks should indicate a moderate decline as
implied demand likely rebounded further in response to colder
temperatures,” said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch &
Associates, a Galena, Illinois, consulting firm.  Consumption of  distillate fuel  rose 0.6 percent to 3.8
million barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 19, up 3.9 percent
from a year earlier, the department reported on Nov. 24.  Gasoline inventories  probably rose 750,000 barrels from
209.6 million the prior week. Seven analysts anticipated a gain
and four projected a decline.  Stockpiles  of crude oil declined 900,000 barrels from 358.6
million the previous week. Seven respondents projected a decline
and four said there was an increase.  Refineries operated  at 85.8 percent of capacity last week,
up 0.3 percentage point from the previous week, according to the
median of analyst responses. U.S. refineries often restart units
in November after conducting maintenance to prepare for the
winter heating season.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 1 in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
