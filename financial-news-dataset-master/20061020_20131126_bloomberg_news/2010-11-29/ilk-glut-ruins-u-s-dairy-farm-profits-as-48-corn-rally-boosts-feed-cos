This year’s agriculture boom is a
bust for U.S. dairy farmers as surging costs for cattle feed
compound a glut of milk products.  While the 27 percent jump in wheat prices and 48 percent
gain in cotton may send farm income to a record, dairies will
lose money in 2011 for the second time in three years, said Mike
Brown, an economist at Glanbia Foods Inc., which processes milk
in Idaho and New Mexico. Corn, a feed ingredient, jumped 33
percent in the two months ended Oct. 31, almost three times the
gain in  wholesale-milk prices . Futures slumped 11 percent.  Dairy farmers expanded herds following the 70 percent jump
in prices to a record in 2007, just before the U.S. began its
longest recession since before World War II and unemployment
rose to the highest level in a quarter century. Weaker demand
was compounded by this year’s drought, floods or freezing
weather from Canada to Kazakhstan that ruined crops and boosted
competition for U.S. grain that dairies require.  “The crop farmers around here have been driving around
with new equipment all the time,” said Linnea Kooistra, who
owns a 250-cow herd in Woodstock, Illinois, with her husband,
Joel. “They’ve been making so much money the last couple of
years because of high commodity prices, but for livestock
farmers, it’s really been a hard time.”  ‘Rough Times’  Farmers lost $2.50 to $4 on average for every 100 pounds
(45.4 kilograms) of  milk  last year, and the deficit may be $1 to
$3 in the first half of 2011, Brown of Glanbia Foods said. The
company’s three plants in Idaho and a joint venture in New
Mexico process a combined 22 million pounds a day and make
cheese and whey.  “We don’t think some dairymen will be able to survive,”
Brown said from his office in Evanston, Illinois. “They’re
looking at some rough times.”  Corn futures have risen 48 percent since the end of June,
the biggest gain in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 raw materials after sugar. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
cut its estimate for the  crop  on Nov. 9 for a third straight
month because of flooding in Iowa and Missouri and hot, dry
weather from Illinois to Ohio.  Futures jumped to $6.175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade that day, the highest since August 2008. Soybeans and
wheat are up more than 37 percent since the end of June and
cotton reached a record on Nov. 10.  Farm Income  Crop rallies may send  farm income  higher than the record
$87.4 billion reached in 2004, according to  Neil Harl , an
agricultural economist at Iowa State University and a former
adviser to the governments of Ukraine and the Czech Republic.  On Nov. 24,  Deere & Co. , the largest maker of agriculture
equipment, forecast that U.S. net farm  cash income  will jump 31
percent this year to the highest ever, before gaining an
additional 15 percent in 2011.  While higher farm incomes improve prospects for Deere
tractors and Mosaic Co. fertilizers,  Dean Foods Co. , the biggest
U.S. milk processor, said on Nov. 9 that consumers are swapping
name-brands for cheaper products.  “Our industry is going through a wrenching ordeal,” Dean
Foods Chief Executive Officer  Gregg Engles  said on a conference
call Nov. 9, after the Dallas-based company reported a 51
percent drop in third-quarter net income.  Culling Herd  The National Milk Producers Federation spent $240 million
culling more than 231,000 cows in the past two years. The
industry-funded group stopped subsidizing the  herd reductions 
last month in favor of promoting exports,  Jerry Kozak , the
federation’s president, said Oct. 28.  The U.S. herd had almost 9.12 million head in October, or
0.2 percent more than a year earlier, according to the USDA.
 Milk output  will rise to a record 192.8 billion pounds this
year, the USDA said Nov. 9. Production per cow in May, usually
the peak month, reached a record 1,868 pounds, the data show.
Cheese inventories reached 1.037 billion pounds in October, the
highest for the month since 1984.  Consumers  aren’t benefiting from the glut. While farmers
sell to processors at higher prices, it’s not enough to cover
additional feed costs. Processors in turn are charging more to
retailers. Grocers sold whole milk at $3.321 a gallon (3.8
liters) on average in October, up 9 percent from a year earlier
and the highest since January 2009, Bureau of Labor Statistics
data show.  Losses Mount  Mounting losses will force producers to keep sending cows
to slaughter, said Phil Plourd, the president of Blimling &
Associates, a commodity researcher in Cottage Grove, Wisconsin.
That should reduce supply and drive  milk prices  to $17 per 100
pounds by the end of 2011, he said. Futures rose 0.8 percent to
settle at $13.81 at 1:10 p.m. today on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  About 60,700 dairy cows were  slaughtered  in the week ended
Nov. 13, or 11 percent more than the same time a year earlier,
according to the most recent USDA data. That’s the ninth
consecutive week of higher year-on-year figures.  Ed Schoen, a farmer in Phelps, New York, is selling 155 of
the 575 acres (233 hectares) of cropland he co-owns to raise
cash for his 180-cow dairy. Schoen said he lost $140,000 in 2009
because of higher costs and lower milk prices.  “We were still under water” for the first nine months of
this year, Schoen, 65, said. “It just got drastic enough that
in order to pay the bills and bring things back into line, we
had to liquidate some real estate.”  Carrying Debt  Plunging exports and rising global production sent futures
for class III milk, used to make cheese, to a six-year low of
$9.24 per 100 pounds in February 2009 on the CME. Farmers took
loans to avoid bankruptcy, and those debts will carry into 2011,
said Jim Dunn, an agricultural economist at Pennsylvania State
University in University Park.  Wholesale-milk prices rose 4.2 percent to $16.94 per 100
pounds in October, the latest USDA data show. Corn futures
advanced 17 percent.  The “cost of production has been higher in 2010, because
they’ve got a lot more interest and principal payments,” Dunn
said. “If 2010 had occurred without 2009 in front of it, nobody
would have thought anything of it. Because of the  balance-sheet 
deterioration in 2009, a number of farmers weren’t able to make
money in 2010 either.”  The industry is pinning its hopes on rising exports to
China, Russia and India, said Hayley Moynihan, a Christchurch,
New Zealand-based senior analyst at agriculture lender Rabobank
International. The U.S. Dollar Index, tracking the currency
against six counterparts, slumped 8.5 percent in the third
quarter, the most in eight years.  ‘Attractive Global Prices’  A weaker dollar “makes exporting more attractive from a
U.S. perspective,” Moynihan said by e-mail. There are
“attractive global prices for dairy commodities, in comparison
to domestic U.S. market returns, due to good demand for dairy
products from developing countries,” she said.  Record shipments of milk products to countries including
China led New Zealand, the world’s biggest dairy exporter, to
narrow its trade deficit in October, Statistics New Zealand said
today in Wellington. Total  exports  climbed 16 percent from
September to NZ$3.68 billion, led by an increase in milk powder.  Earlier this month, the U.S. dollar dropped to a 31-month
low against the New Zealand dollar, boosting the appeal of
American supplies. Dairy products account for almost a quarter
of New Zealand’s merchandise  exports  and 7 percent of the
economy, according to the USDA.  Obama Boost  Agriculture already is giving President  Barack Obama  a
boost toward his goal of doubling overseas sales of U.S. goods
by 2015.  Farm exports  from the U.S., the world’s largest grain
shipper, may top the 2008 record of $115.3 billion in 2011,
according to  Joe Glauber , the USDA’s chief economist.  Dairy exports totaled $2.751 billion in the first nine
months of 2010, on pace to break the 2008 record, according to
the Arlington, Virginia-based U.S. Dairy Export Council.  Third-quarter shipments of cheese rose 69 percent to 45,788
metric tons, led by sales gains to Mexico, South Korea and
Japan, council data show.  Nonfat-dry milk , the biggest export
product by value this year, surged 45 percent, driven by
consumption in Southeast Asia.  “We’ve already gotten some very nice demand recovery in
export markets,” said  Scott Brown , an economist at the
University of Missouri. “2011 will continue to see some
expansion.”  That may not be enough to eliminate the  glut , said Cal
Brandt, 50, who runs a 110-cow dairy herd with his brother in
Bryant, Wisconsin. He lost about $128,000 in 2009 and was
unprofitable in six of the first 10 months of this year.  “The biggest problem with the dairy industry is every time
the price gets to $17 or $18, guys start adding onto their farm
operations,” Brandt said. “When you start adding cows, that’s
when the prices fall quickly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
