Irish banks’ senior bonds rose after
the nation’s 85 billion-euro ($113 billion) bailout spared
holders of the debt from having to share in lenders’ losses.  Bank of Ireland Plc’s 1.47 billion euros of senior
floating-rate notes due September 2011 rose 8.25 cents on the
euro to 91.6 cents as of 4:22 p.m. in London, a 10 percent
increase, according to composite prices compiled by Bloomberg.
The securities fell 7 percent on Nov. 26 on concern senior
noteholders were being lined up to take some of the burden of
the imminent Irish rescue.  Senior bondholders will escape the cost of the bailout led
by the European Union and International Monetary Fund, with
holders of subordinated debt forced to share in the pain. Under
the agreement, Irish lenders will receive 35 billion euros of
the overall package, with 10 billion euros set aside for their
immediate recapitalization.  “There should be a relief rally on senior debt of Irish
and other peripheral banks, as well as those banks identified as
having large exposure to peripheral countries,”  Olivia Frieser 
and  Ivan Zubo , BNP Paribas SA analysts in London, wrote in a
note to clients.  Allied Irish Banks Plc’s 1.5 billion euros of September
2011 senior floating-rate securities climbed 8.2 cents to 87.7
cents, a 10 percent rise, Bloomberg composite prices show. The
notes tumbled 7.2 percent at the end of last week.  Senior bonds of Anglo Irish Bank Plc, which the government
nationalized in January 2009, gained. The lender’s 750 million
euros of floating-rate notes due in January 2011 added 7.5
cents, or 9 percent, to 90 cents, Bloomberg composite prices
show.  Subordinated Bonds  Subordinated bonds of Irish lenders also pared last week’s
declines, even after  Ajai Chopra , deputy director of the
European Department of the IMF, said holders of this debt may
have to share in bank losses.  Ireland is “exploring” further deeply discounted
liability management exercises by its banks, after Anglo Irish’s
“very successful” debt exchange, Chopra said at a press
conference yesterday.  Bank of Ireland’s 420 million euros of subordinated 4.625
percent notes due 2019 rose 8 cents, or 20 percent, to 47.5
cents, according to composite prices on Bloomberg. Allied Irish
Banks’ 419 million euros of 10.75 percent subordinated notes due
2017 climbed 0.75 cent to 30.3 cents.  The situation for subordinated bondholders holding dated
securities has “marginally improved,” said  Jose Mosquera , who
manages $41 million as a Madrid-based asset manager at  Breogan
Global Financial Fund .  “Burden-sharing by subordinated debt holders would take
place when capital needs arise, after the initial injection
provided by the package,” Mosquera said. Any potential buyback
may “very well follow a non-coercive route, such as a tender at
market prices,” he said.  European and IMF officials also agreed a permanent facility
over the weekend, known as the European Stabilization Mechanism,
to help ailing governments and replace the existing 440 billion-
euro rescue package put in place earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
