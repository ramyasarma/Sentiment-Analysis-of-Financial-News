Apollo Global Management LLC , the
private-equity firm run by  Leon Black , named  Marc Spilker , a
former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive, to the new position
of president.  Spilker, 46, will oversee Apollo’s day-to-day operations
and sit on the company’s executive committee, which includes
Black and senior managing director  Josh Harris , the New York-
based firm said in a statement today. He is scheduled to start
Dec. 1.  Spilker was previously the co-head of investment management
at Goldman Sachs, turning the responsibilities over to  Edward Forst  at the end of February. He retired from New York-based
Goldman Sachs in May, Apollo said. Goldman Sachs’ investment
management division oversees about $1 trillion in assets,
according to the statement.  “His successful career at Goldman Sachs and his extensive
knowledge of the alternative asset management industry make him
an ideal addition to our executive committee,” Black said in
the statement.  Spilker earned an undergraduate degree from the University
of Pennsylvania and a master’s degree in business from the
university’s Wharton School. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1990 and
became a partner in 1996.  Before joining the investment-management division in 2006
as the head of global alternative asset management, Spilker was
responsible for U.S. equities trading and global equity
derivatives. He previously oversaw fixed income, currencies and
commodities in Japan and served as global head of foreign-
exchange options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
