Copper gained after Europe agreed to
a bailout for Ireland, outweighing tensions on the Korea
Peninsula. Aluminum and zinc also increased.  The metal for three-month delivery rose as much as 1.4
percent to $8,355.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $8,325 at 2:39 p.m. in Shanghai. Three-month zinc
advanced 2.2 percent to $2,150.50 a ton.  “As the Ireland debt crisis dissipates, copper has found
some support,” Wu Jianjian, an analyst at Yong’an Futures Co.,
said by phone from Hangzhou.  European government officials, meeting yesterday in
Brussels, agreed on offering Ireland an 85 billion-euro ($113
billion) lifeline, while scaled back proposals to saddle
bondholders with losses in future budget crises.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, erased earlier
gains, and traded little changed at 80.352 as of 2:41 p.m. in
Singapore. Asian stocks advanced, with the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index climbing 0.5 percent to 129.57.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
expects demand for some metals, including iron ore and copper,
will double over the next 15 years to 20 years, Chief Executive
Officer Tom Albanese said today. Demand will be driven by the
increasing modernization of developing nations, he said.  In Chile, Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
venture in northern Chile continues to operate normally as a
strike at the world’s fourth-largest copper mine entered a
fourth week. The company is employing non-union employees and
contract workers, while it negotiates individually with union
members, a spokeswoman said on Nov. 26.  Speculation Curb  In China, the world’s largest metals consumer, Shanghai
Futures Exchange will start to increase margins after the market
closes today. The rates on copper, aluminum, steel wire, gold
and fuel oil futures will rise to 10 percent, steel-reinforcing
bars and zinc to 12 percent, and rubber to 13 percent.  The bourse will also widen the daily price-move limits for
all products to 6 percent.  “The latest measure seemed to have damped market
participants’ trading interest,” Wu said.  Copper for March delivery in Shanghai increased 1.3 percent
to close at 62,440 yuan ($9,362) a ton.  South Korean President Lee Myung Bak told visiting Chinese
State Councilor Dai Bingguo yesterday in Seoul the time isn’t
right to resume six-party talks with North Korea, Yonhap News
said. Lee said today to make Kim Jong Il’s regime pay for
military attacks after it shelled a South Korean island, killing
four people.  Aluminum in London gained 0.4 percent to $2,280 a ton, and
lead added 1.2 percent at $2,307 a ton. Tin increased 0.4
percent to $24,300 a ton, while nickel advanced 1.2 percent to
$22,830 a ton.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Ravil Shirodkar.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
