Gold rose for the first time in
three sessions on speculation that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis will boost demand for the precious metal as a haven.  The euro fell to a two-month low against the dollar after a
bailout for Ireland failed to ease concern that the region’s
debt crisis will spread. Gold has gained 25 percent this year,
touching a record $1,424.30 an ounce in New York on Nov. 9.  “If your currency is declining in value, there’s a move to
get into something that will hold its value, and gold is that
instrument at the moment,” said Frank Lesh, a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.  Gold futures for February delivery rose $3.20, or 0.2
percent, to $1,367.50 an ounce at 2 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. In the previous two sessions, the metal lost 1.1 percent.  The euro dropped as much as 1.3 percent against the dollar
on speculation that Spain and Portugal may be next to ask for
aid. Gold priced in euros reached a record in June when Greece
sought a bailout.  Gold’s gains may be limited because “a big head-and-
shoulders top is forming on the daily chart,” said Matt Zeman,
a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “People
are shying away from gold.”  The chart pattern occurs when prices form three consecutive
peaks, with the middle being the highest. The start of a decline
is signaled when the metal falls below a support level in line
with the low points between the peaks.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 42.1 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $27.193 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has jumped
61 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $16, or 2.4
percent, to $694.85 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has surged 70 percent this year. Platinum
futures for January delivery slipped 60 cents to $1,644.60 an
ounce. The metal has climbed 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
