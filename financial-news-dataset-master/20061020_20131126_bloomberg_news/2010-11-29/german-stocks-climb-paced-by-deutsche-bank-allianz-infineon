German stocks  fell as optimism that
the 85 billion-euro ($111.3 billion) aid package for Ireland
will stem Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis withered and investors
demanded higher returns at Italian and Belgian bond auctions.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and Daimler AG, the world’s
biggest makers of luxury cars, led European carmakers lower. MAN
SE and ThyssenKrupp AG each lost more than 3 percent. Phoenix
Solar AG advanced as UBS AG recommended buying the shares.  Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index  declined 2.2 percent to
6,697.97 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, the gauge’s
largest decline in five months. The regional  Euro Stoxx 50 Index 
last week tumbled 3.8 percent, its worst weekly showing since
July, as concern grew that more countries in Europe will
struggle to reduce budget deficits and will face higher
borrowing costs. The broader HDAX Index in Germany also dropped
2.2 percent today.  “The risk of an escalation of tensions persists,”  Tammo Greetfeld , senior equity strategist at UniCredit Research in
Munich, wrote today. “The performance of national equity
markets will continue to diverge strongly. We remain underweight
equities and underweight Stoxx Europe Banks.”  Ireland, swamped by the bursting of a decade-long real-
estate bubble and with unemployment approaching 14 percent,
became the first country to tap the European Union’s 750
billion-euro rescue fund. The government said it will pay
average interest of 5.8 percent on the bailout package, which
also includes 22.5 billion euros from the International Monetary
Fund and 17.5 billion euros from the country’s own resources,
including the National Pension Reserve Fund.  European finance chiefs ended crisis talks in Brussels
yesterday by endorsing a Franco-German compromise on post-2013
rescues that means investors won’t automatically take losses to
share the cost with taxpayers as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
initially proposed to the consternation of bond traders.  Italy, Belgium Debt Sales  Still, Italy’s borrowing costs rose at a sale of 6.8
billion euros of bonds today. The Italian Treasury sold 3
billion euros of securities due in March 2021 at a yield of 4.43
percent, compared with 3.89 percent at a sale on Oct. 28, data
from the Bank of Italy showed today. Yields on 2013 notes also
climbed to 2.86 percent from 2.32 percent.  The cost of insuring bonds sold by the government of
Belgium rose 7 basis points to a record 168, according to CMA
prices for credit-default swaps.  BMW, Daimler Fall  BMW lost 2.6 percent to 57.74 euros, while Daimler declined
3.4 percent to 49.79 euros. European carmakers slid 3.1 percent
today, the  worst performance  among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Porsche SE  retreated 3.2 percent to 55.88 euros even after
the maker of the 911 sports car posted a 155 million-euro profit
in its fiscal first quarter, compared with a 431 million-euro
loss a year earlier.  MAN, Europe’s third-largest truckmaker, fell 4.1 percent to
90.59 euros. ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, slipped
3.7 percent to 29.56 euros.  Phoenix Solar  increased 8 percent to 23.60 euros, the
biggest gain in more than six months. The maker of solar power
systems was rated a new “buy” at UBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
