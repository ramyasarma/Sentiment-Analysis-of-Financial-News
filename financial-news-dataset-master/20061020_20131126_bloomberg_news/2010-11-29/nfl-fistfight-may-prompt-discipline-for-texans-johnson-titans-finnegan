Andre Johnson  of the Houston Texans
said he expects to be disciplined by the National Football
League after an on-field fistfight with Tennessee cornerback
 Cortland Finnegan .  Wide receiver Johnson and Finnegan may face fines or
suspensions for the incident during the fourth quarter of the
Texans 20-0 win yesterday. Both players were ejected.  “I just lost my cool and I wish I could take back what
happened, but I can’t,” Johnson told reporters. “I’m pretty
sure that I’ll be disciplined for it. When that time comes,
I’ll find out what it is and have to deal with it.”  Johnson had nine catches for 56 yards and a touchdown
yesterday, when he became the first player in NFL history to
catch at least 60 passes in each of his first eight seasons.  After receiving a game ball from Texans coach  Gary Kubiak 
in the locker room, Johnson apologized to his teammates, fans
and the organization. Finnegan didn’t speak to the media after
the game.  The incident started when Finnegan, playing about one yard
off the line of scrimmage, jumped forward when the ball was
snapped and shoved Johnson in the facemask with both hands.  Johnson grabbed Finnegan’s facemask, tore his helmet off
and grabbed him by the jersey as the players swung each other
around. The Titans’ cornerback responded by pulling Johnson’s
helmet off and flinging it to the ground. Johnson then tossed
Finnegan to the ground and took three swings.  Exchanged Words  “He was mad because we exchanged some words,” Johnson
said. “He snatched my helmet off and I snatched his off and it
went from there.”  Johnson appeared to connect on two punches to Finnegan’s
head and missed on an uppercut before officials intervened.  “It’s out of character for me,” Johnson said. “I hope
that I’m not suspended for the next game.”  Houston (5-6) next plays at Philadelphia on Dec. 2.
Tennessee (5-6) hosts Jacksonville on Dec. 5.  Johnson was fined $7,500 by the NFL last season for pulling
Finnegan to the ground by his face mask during a scuffle in a
34-31 Houston win. Finnegan was fined three times over a three-
week span earlier this season, Fox Sports said.  “It’s not good for the game,” said Titans coach  Jeff Fisher , who is co-chairman of the NFL’s competition committee.
“You don’t want to see a player slug another player like
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
