The euro traded near a two-month low
against the yen on concern that Ireland’s banking crisis will
spread to Portugal and Spain amid signs the region’s economic
recovery is slowing.  The currency headed for its first monthly loss versus the
dollar since August after Spanish 10-year bonds slid by the most
since the euro’s debut and before data that may show Europe’s
unemployment rate held at a 12-year high. The dollar was close
to a two-month high against the yen ahead of a report forecast
to show U.S. consumer confidence rose a second month. The
Australian dollar rose for the first time in four days after the
nation’s building approvals increased by the most since March.  “Markets think Europe’s debt crisis story won’t end here
with Ireland,” said  Shinichi Hayashi , a dealer at Shinkin
Central Bank, the central institution for Japan’s financial
cooperatives. “There’s uncertainty over the banking sector in
other countries in the region. I see the euro falling.”  The euro bought 110.56 yen as of 11:52 a.m. in Tokyo from
110.60 yen in New York yesterday, when it touched 110.26, the
lowest since Sept. 15. It was at $1.3137 from $1.3125. The
dollar fetched 84.14 yen from 84.26 yen yesterday when it
appreciated to 84.41 yen, the strongest level since Sept. 27.  The 16-nation euro area’s jobless rate remained unchanged
from the previous month at 10.1 percent in October, according to
a Bloomberg News Survey of economists before today’s report.
That’s would be the highest reading since 1998.  Gross domestic product  in the 16-nation euro region may
grow at a 1.5 percent rate in 2011 from 1.7 percent this year,
the Brussels-based European Commission said in a report
published yesterday.  ‘Somewhat Lower’  The euro has fallen 1.4 percent in November versus the yen
and 5.8 percent against the greenback, the worst performance
among major currencies.  “As markets continue to fret over Irish contagion, we
wouldn’t be surprised to see further declines in the euro-
dollar,”  Spiros Papadopoulos , a senior economist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, wrote in a research note
today. The next key support level is viewed as around $1.3000
per euro, he said.  Investor concern has shifted to Spain and Portugal since
Nov. 28, when European governments sought to bolster the euro by
giving Ireland an 85 billion-euro ($112 billion) bailout package
and scaling back proposals that would have forced bondholders to
bear some costs of future aid.  The 10-year Spanish bond yield jumped 28 basis points
yesterday to as high as 5.45 percent, the highest since 2002.
The  difference  in yield, or spread, over German bunds rose to a
euro-era record of 267 basis points.  U.S. Data  “Portugal needs to assure strong fiscal consolidation
continuing in 2012 and beyond,” European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said yesterday. If
growth proved to be “somewhat lower” than expected, “then
it’s essential still to meet fiscal targets by taking additional
measures,” he said. Rehn will speak in Brussels today.  The dollar is poised for its first monthly gain since April
against the yen on speculation the U.S. economic recovery is
picking up. The Conference Board’s confidence  index  climbed to
53.0 this month from 50.2 in October, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists before today’s report.  “We’ll likely to get a series of favorable economic data
for the dollar,” said  Keiji Matsumoto , a currency strategist in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Improving consumer
sentiment is one of factors that pushes the greenback higher.”  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the dollar against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, was at 80.745
from 80.837 yesterday, when it touched 81.142, the highest since
Sept. 21.  Australia Permits  The so-called Aussie advanced after a government report
showed the number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments advanced 9.3 percent from September.  “The data has been rather positive, and I think that’s
given a little bit of support to the Aussie,” said  Mitul Kotecha , the Hong Kong-based head of global foreign-exchange
strategy at Credit Agricole CIB. “A jump in building approvals
was particularly surprising, quite robust reading.”  Australia’s currency was at 96.35 U.S. cents from 96.31
cents yesterday when it reached 95.67 cents, a level not seen
since Oct. 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
