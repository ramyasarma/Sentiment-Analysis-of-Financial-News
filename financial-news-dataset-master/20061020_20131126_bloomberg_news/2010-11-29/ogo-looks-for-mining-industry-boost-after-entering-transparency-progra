Togo  is hoping to attract mining
companies after it entered into a program that boosts
transparency in the industry, said Energy and Mines Minister
Noupokou Dammipi.  “There are certainly potential investors who want to come
in Togo and invest in the mining industry but they may be
scared,” Dammipi said in an e-mailed response to questions Nov.
24. By joining the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative, the Lome-based government “would like to send a
signal to investors across the world that Togo is a safe and
sure destination for business in the mining sector,” he said.  Togo’s mining industry has been dominated by phosphates,
the ingredient for fertilizers. The West African nation has been
investing to boost production, including investing in new
equipment in order to triple production to 3 million metric
tons, Dammipi said in September. Last month, Italy’s  Eni SpA 
signed an agreement to explore for oil off its coast.  The Oslo-based transparency program sets standard for
companies and countries involved in extractive industries to
 publish revenue  earned from oil, gas and mining, according to
its website.  Ghana, Togo’s neighbor and Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, and Liberia are Africa’s only full-member countries.
Togo was named a candidate country on Oct. 19 and has two years
to become compliant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
