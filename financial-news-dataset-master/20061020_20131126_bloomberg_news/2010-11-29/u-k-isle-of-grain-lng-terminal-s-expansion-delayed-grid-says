The Isle of Grain liquefied natural
gas terminal near London may not have a fourth expansion for two
years or more, according to the head of National Grid Plc.  “We clearly are not going to be starting investing in
Grain Four this year, as we might have been, because we haven’t
reached a commercial agreement yet,”  Steve Holliday , the
network manager’s chief executive officer, said in a Nov. 26
interview in London. “It would be great if it was six months
but it could be two plus years.”  The terminal is scheduled to complete its phase-three
expansion this year, bringing total investment to about 1
billion pounds ($1.6 billion), according to National Grid’s
 website . The facility will be able to import 14.8 million tons
of LNG a year, or about 20 percent of Britain’s annual gas
demand. E.ON AG, Iberdrola SA and Centrica Plc have bought
import capacity for the third phase, which increases the number
of import slots to 250 a year and includes a new jetty able to
handle the world’s biggest LNG ships, known as Q-Max tankers.  A fourth expansion would increase storage capacity at the
Isle of Grain, which has the world’s largest above-ground  LNG
tanks , according to National Grid.  BP Plc, Algeria’s Sonatrach, GDF Suez SA also have import
capacity at Grain. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid to ease
transportation and storage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
