Texas Christian University  accepted
an invitation to become an all-sports member of the  Big East
Conference , Fanhouse.com reported.  The Fort Worth, Texas, university will begin Big East play
during the 2012-13 school year, the  website said,  citing
unidentified people from within the industry.  The Horned Frogs would become the Big East’s ninth football
team and 17th basketball team.  TCU went undefeated in football during the regular season,
posting a 12-0 record out of the Mountain West Conference.  The Horned Frogs are third in the Bowl Championship Series
standings, behind Auburn and No. 2 Oregon. The rankings
determine which two schools will play for the national
championship on Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona. Auburn still must
face South Carolina in the Southeastern Conference championship
game on Dec. 4, while Oregon plays Oregon State.  The Big East said a few weeks ago that it wanted to raise
its football membership to 10 schools, and it also has made an
offer to Villanova, which is a member for all sports except
football, according to Fanhouse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
