Japanese  stocks  rose, driving the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to the highest close since June, as the
yen at a two-month low against the dollar improved the outlook
for export earnings and analysts boosted investment ratings.  Nissan Motor Co. , which is Japan’s third-largest carmaker
by sales and gets about 75 percent of its revenue abroad,
climbed 1.5 percent. Sony Corp., an electronics maker, and
Marubeni Corp., a trading company, advanced at least 2.5 percent
on higher brokerage ratings. Taiheiyo Cement Corp., Japan’s
biggest cement maker by sales, gained 3.9 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper said the company’s profit will likely jump.  “The yen is supporting Japanese stocks today,” said
 Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees $26 billion. “Japanese
stocks are still lagging behind as people had sold stocks on
concern about earnings because of the yen’s appreciation.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent to 10,125.99 at 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, its highest close since June 21. The broader  Topix  index
gained 0.9 percent to 874.59, with more than three times as many
stocks advancing as declining. The two gauges climbed the most
among major equity benchmark indexes in the Asia-Pacific region.  The Nikkei has dropped 4 percent this year, compared with
gains of 6.6 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the
U.S. and 5 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Japanese gauge are valued at 17.7 times estimated  earnings  on
average, compared with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 11.9 times
for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Yen Weakens  Nissan rose 1.5 percent to 797 yen. Kyocera Corp., an
electronics maker that gets more than half of its sales outside
Japan, advanced 1.9 percent to 8,600 yen. Nintendo Co., the
world’s biggest maker of portable video-game machines, rallied
2.2 percent to 21,980 yen. Canon Inc., a camera maker that
derives about 80 percent of its revenue abroad, gained 1 percent
to 4,040 yen.  The yen depreciated to 84.20 against the dollar today in
Tokyo, matching its rate in New York on Nov. 26 and the lowest
level since Sept. 28. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when converted into their home
currency.  “People are less worried that companies will cut their
profit forecasts,” said  Takero Inaizumi , head of equity
research in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors Securities Co.  Sony  advanced 2.8 percent to 2,970 yen, the highest close
since May 13, after Nomura Holdings Inc. boosted its
recommendation on the company to “buy” from “neutral.” The
stock was the  biggest support  for the Topix.  Trading Companies Gain  Marubeni leapt 3.6 percent to 554 yen, the highest price
since May. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its  rating  on the
company to “buy” from “neutral,” and Daiwa Securities Group
Inc. increased its rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Other trading companies also increased as Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc. reiterated its “buy” rating on the industry,
citing earnings and valuations.  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s
largest commodities trader, gained 0.9 percent to 2,140 yen.
Sojitz Corp. leapt 3.7 percent to 168 yen. Itochu Corp. rose 1.5
percent to 790 yen.  Masaaki Shirakawa , the governor of the Bank of Japan, said
today in a speech that expanding a 5 trillion-yen ($59.5 billion)
fund set up to buy government and corporate debt and other
assets is a “probable option.”  “Shirakawa’s comment reassured the market,” said Takashi
Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Inc., a Tokyo-based brokerage.  Taiheiyo Cement jumped 3.9 percent to 106 yen. The cement
maker will probably say operating profit tripled in the year
ending March because of cost reductions and a recovery in demand
in Japan, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co., a  smaller rival  of Taiheiyo
Cement, advanced 3.8 percent to 193 yen, the highest level since
September 2009. The report said profit will probably rise 24
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
