The World Bank is revising its
energy strategy for Africa and plans to support projects that
will generate a further 30 gigawatts of electricity on the
continent over the next five years, a bank official said.  “We are looking at various projects in the whole of sub-
Saharan Africa to see which ones are ready to go,” Reynold
Duncan, an energy specialist at the World Bank, told reporters
at a conference in Cape Town today. “We are not going to
provide money for 30 gigawatts. I cannot say how much the World
Bank has set aside. We take the lead, we try and facilitate
investment and financing from others.”  Sub-Saharan Africa currently has the capacity to generate
68 gigawatts of power, with South Africa accounting for about 40
gigawatts, Anton Eberhard, a professor at the University of Cape
Town’s Graduate School of Business told the conference. Thirty-
three countries can produce less than 500 megawatts of power and
eleven less than 100 megawatts, he said.  “Two out of three Africans do not have access to
electricity,” Eberhard said. “The rate of population growth is
outstripping new connections.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
