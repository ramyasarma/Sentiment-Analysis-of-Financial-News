Sony Corp.  and  Sharp Corp.  denied a
report they have scrapped plans to jointly make liquid-crystal
display panels at Sharp’s plant in Sakai, near Osaka.  Sony is continuing talks on LCD production with Sharp and
may increase its stake in the joint venture that operates the
plant to as much as 34 percent by the end of April,  Shigenori Yoshida , a Tokyo-based spokesman, said today by telephone,
responding to a weekend report in the Yomiuri newspaper.  Sharp spokesman Toshiyuki Matsumura said there has been no
change to its contract with Sony concerning liquid-crystal
display supply or ownership of the venture. Matsumura made the
comments by phone today from Osaka, where Sharp is based.  The Yomiuri  reported  Sony would cancel its plans to jointly
produce liquid-crystal display panels with Sharp and boost
procurement from Taiwan. The report said Sony may also drop its
plan to raise its stake in the firm from the current 7 percent.  Sony rose 2.2 percent to 2,951 yen as of 11 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sharp gained 0.9 percent to 822 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
