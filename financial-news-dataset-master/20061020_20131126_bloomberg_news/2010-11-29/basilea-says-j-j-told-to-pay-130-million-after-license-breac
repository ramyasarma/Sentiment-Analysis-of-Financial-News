Johnson & Johnson  should pay  Basilea
Pharmaceutica AG  $130 million as compensation for lost income
related to a breach of the license agreement covering the
antibiotic ceftobiprole, a tribunal found.  The Netherlands Arbitration Institute tribunal found J&J in
breach of the accord and said the payment is “immediately
enforceable,” Basel, Switzerland-based Basilea said today in an
e-mailed statement. The sum is meant as compensation for lost
milestone payments, other damages and interest, Basilea said.  Basilea said in June that Europe’s drug regulator rejected
a renewed request to have ceftobiprole recommended for sale. The
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the scientific
advisory panel for the European Medicines Agency, said in
February that trials hadn’t followed “good clinical practice”
at some sites and the drug shouldn’t be approved. U.S. health
regulators last December similarly rejected ceftobiprole because
trial data were “unreliable.”  Basilea  said today it’s “focusing on completing the return
of ceftobiprole to Basilea at the latest by February 2011 so
that we can move forward with its future development.”  The Swiss company last year filed the arbitration claim
against J&J relating to delays in the drug’s development. The
companies ended their partnership in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
