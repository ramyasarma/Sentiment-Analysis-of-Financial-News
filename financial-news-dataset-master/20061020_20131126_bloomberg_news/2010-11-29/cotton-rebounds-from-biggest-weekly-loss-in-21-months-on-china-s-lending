Cotton rose the most allowed in New
York, after slumping by the exchange limit three times last
week, as efforts to curb inflation may be less severe than
expected in China, the world’s top consumer. Orange juice fell.  Data from China’s central bank suggest the country’s
domestic banks may end up lending more money this year than the
government intended. After raising interest rates last month,
officials have threatened to impose controls to curb agriculture
prices and the fastest inflation in 25 months. Cotton has
dropped 24 percent from a record earlier this month.  “The Chinese stepping on the brakes is not as severe as
initially feared,” said  Peter Egli , the director of risk
management in Chicago at Plexus Cotton Ltd., a U.K.-based
merchant. “That may have led to a little bit of a turnaround in
the Chinese market.”  Cotton for March delivery rose by the exchange maximum of 4
cents, or 3.6 percent, to settle at $1.1576 a pound at 2:37 p.m.
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber lost 9.2 percent last
week, the biggest such drop since February 2009.  Cotton futures have jumped 53 percent this year, reaching a
record of $1.5195 a pound on Nov. 10. Prices surged on concerns
that mounting demand in China would outpace dwindling supplies
in countries around the world, especially in the U.S., the
largest exporter.  China’s domestic banks extended 6.9 trillion yuan ($1.04
trillion) of new  loans  in the 10 months through October,
suggesting that the government’s full-year target of 7.5
trillion yuan may be breached, according to central bank data.  Cotlook Index  The  Cotlook A Index , which reflects the average of the five
cheapest cotton prices at Far East ports, fell 3.2 percent to
$1.4335 a pound today. The difference between the Cotlook A
Index and cotton futures prices was 27.59 cents today, down from
a 15-year high of 36.34 cents last week.  “The physical prices as represented by the A Index are way
overvalued or the futures market is way undervalued,” Egli
said. “Maybe the two will approach each other again.”  In China, demand will outpace supply by 17 million bales in
the year that ends in July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
forecast earlier this month. The Asian nation may import 15
million bales, up 38 percent from last year, according to a Nov.
9 USDA  report . A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Cotton output in China may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, research company Cncotton.com has said.  China’s government will hold an annual economic meeting in
Beijing late next week to set guidelines for monetary and fiscal
policy in 2011, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Officials may discuss lending and inflation targets at the Dec.
10-12 meeting, one of the people said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 1.15 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $1.502 a pound in New York.
Earlier, the most-active contract touched $1.493, the lowest
since Oct. 26. The commodity has advanced 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
