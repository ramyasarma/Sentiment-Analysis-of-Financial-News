Foxconn Technology Group’s
Singapore unit has sued  Creative Technology Ltd . for failing to
pay $500,576 for supplies and services that Foxconn, the world’s
biggest contract manufacturer of electronics, said it provided.  Foxconn Singapore Pte said Creative, the maker of the Zen
music player and Ziio tablet computer, repeatedly failed to make
payment and didn’t give any “substantive” reason for its
refusal, according to a Sept. 8 lawsuit filed with the Singapore
High Court. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 3.  Foxconn isn’t entitled to any payments because there are no
contracts with either Foxconn or its flagship  Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co ., Creative claimed in court papers.  Foxconn refused Creative’s request for a discount on the
fees, according to court papers. Foxconn, controlled by Taiwan’s
richest man  Terry Gou , in September cut its long-term growth
target by 50 percent after raising wages and accelerating
factory relocation plans in China.  Edmund Ding , spokesman for Taipei-based Hon Hai declined to
immediately comment on the lawsuit. Creative spokeswoman  Wynne Leong  couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Creative fell 0.5 percent to S$4.01 as of 3:12 p.m. in
Singapore trading, extending its decline this year to 38
percent. The company reported a $3.6 million  loss  in the fiscal
first quarter ended Sept. 30, widening from a $1.04 million
deficit a year earlier.  The case is Foxconn Singapore Pte v Creative Technology
Ltd. S614/2010 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
