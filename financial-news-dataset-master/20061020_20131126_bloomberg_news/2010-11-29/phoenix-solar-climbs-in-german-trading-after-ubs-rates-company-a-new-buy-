Phoenix Solar AG  rose as much as 9.5
percent in Frankfurt as UBS AG initiated coverage of the German
manufacturer of solar-power systems with a “buy” rating.  The shares traded as high as 23.94 euros and were at 23.60,
an 8 percent gain, at 1:46 p.m. local time. The stock was the
best performer on the 87-member  WilderHill New Energy Global
Innovation Index , which declined 0.8 percent.  Sulzemoos-based Phoenix Solar trades at a 50 percent
discount to its peers in terms of enterprise value and earnings,
UBS analyst  Jean-Francois Meymandi  wrote in the report today.
The stock trades at about 3.8 times estimated 2011 enterprise
value divided by earnings before interest and tax, he said.  Today’s gain reduced the company’s year-to-date loss to 44
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
