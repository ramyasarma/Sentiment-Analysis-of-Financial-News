Anadarko Petroleum Corp ., the U.S.-
based partner in  BP Plc ’s damaged Gulf of Mexico well, said
it made a third “major” natural gas discovery off Mozambique.  Drilling at the Lagosta prospect found more than 550 feet
(168 meters) of net gas pay, the Woodlands, Texas-based company
today said in a statement. The discovery is within 20 miles of
the company’s Barquentine and Windjammer prospects.  “The three discoveries announced to date already exceed
the resource size threshold necessary to support a liquefied
natural gas development,”  Bob Daniels , the company’s senior
vice president for worldwide exploration, said in the statement.  The Windjammer discovery, announced in February, was the
company’s first deep-water gas discovery off Mozambique. In
October, Anadarko said drilling at the Barquentine exploration
well encountered more than 416 net feet of gas pay.  Having drilled to a depth of 13,850 feet in 5,080 feet of
water, Anadarko said it plans to drill an additional 8,770 feet
before moving the rig southwest to the Tubarao exploration well.
