India’s stocks rose as some
investors judged a four-day slide in the benchmark index amid
corruption probes as excessive relative to the outlook for the
nation’s economic growth.  Reliance Industries Ltd. , the nation’s most valuable
company, surged the most in more than six months. Drugmaker
 Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.  increased the most in a month after
PharmAsia News said it got U.S. approval to sell a drug. India’s
government will tomorrow say that gross domestic product rose
above 8 percent for a third consecutive quarter, according to
the median  estimate  of 30 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “We remain bullish on India’s economic growth,” said New
Delhi-based  D.K. Aggarwal , who manages about $100 million as
chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd. “Some stocks
are available at a bargain after last week’s fall. It’s a good
time to buy.” Aggarwal is buying shares of drugmakers, consumer
goods companies and software exporters while avoiding those of
real estate companies. He declined to name specific shares.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
advanced 268.49, or 1.4 percent, to 19,405.10 as of the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National
Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to 5,830. The  BSE 200 Index 
increased 1.3 percent to 2,427.63.  Bribery Probe  The Sensex has lost 7.6 percent since reaching an all-time
high on Nov. 5 as officials said they will investigate the sale
of phone licenses for below-market prices and authorities
arrested eight Indian bankers and brokers following a bribery
probe. A four-day slide to Nov. 26, the longest since May,
erased 4.1 percent from the gauge.  Reliance Industries jumped 3.8 percent to 998.4 rupees, its
steepest gain since May 10. Its  relative strength index , a gauge
of how rapidly prices advance or decline, was 28.65 on Nov. 26,
the lowest level since Aug. 31. A reading below 30 signals to
some analysts that the stock is poised to rise, while a reading
above 70 suggests it may fall. The stock was today’s biggest
gainer on the Sensex.  ICICI Bank Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender,
gained 2.7 percent to 1,154.3 rupees, erasing a 2.1 percent drop
over the previous week.  F&C Asset Management Plc , a U.K. fund that owns shares in
India’s largest software services company and mortgage lender,
is holding on to the investments because the companies will be
sheltered from corruption probes that drove a three-week decline
in the Sensex.  Mahtani Picks  “These issues are manageable so long as there is no
systemic risk,”  Sam Mahtani , who helps oversee about $2.5
billion as a director of emerging-market equities at F&C Asset
in London, said in a telephone interview on Nov. 26. “I
wouldn’t be changing anything at the moment.”  F&C Asset funds bought shares of  Housing Development
Finance Corp. , the country’s biggest mortgage lender, in July,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mahtani also holds  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. , the largest software services
provider,  HDFC Bank Ltd. , the nation’s No. 3 lender, and  Infosys
Technologies Ltd. , Tata’s largest rival.  Housing Development gained 1.5 percent to 694.85 rupees,
trimming a 3.4 percent slide in the previous four trading
sessions. Tata Consultancy advanced 2.3 percent to 1,071.3
rupees, while Infosys added 0.7 percent to 3,063.95 rupees.
 Wipro Ltd. , the third-biggest, increased 2.5 percent to 417.75
rupees.  Ranbaxy  Ranbaxy jumped 3.8 percent to 566.75 rupees, its steepest
advance since Nov. 1. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave
Ranbaxy approval to sell a generic version of Eisai Co.’s
Aricept Alzheimer’s treatment from today, PharmAsia News
reported Nov. 27.  Krishnan Ramalingam , a spokesman for Ranbaxy,
declined to comment.  GMR Infrastructure Ltd.  surged 5.4 percent to 46.15 rupees,
the most in six months. The GMR Group, controlled by billionaire
 G.M. Rao , said it’s selling a 50 percent stake in Massachusetts-
based InterGen to China Huaneng Group for $1.23 billion.  The Central Statistical Organisation GDP report is due at
11 a.m. tomorrow in New Delhi. India’s economy expanded 8.2
percent in the three months ended September, according to the
economists’ survey.  Foreign fund inflows have almost doubled this year to an
all-time high as investors bet consumer spending will boost
corporate earnings.  Overseas  investors  sold a net  5.32 billion rupees  ($166.6
million) of Indian shares on Nov. 25, reducing this year’s
record inflows to 1.316 trillion rupees, the Securities &
Exchange Board of India said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
