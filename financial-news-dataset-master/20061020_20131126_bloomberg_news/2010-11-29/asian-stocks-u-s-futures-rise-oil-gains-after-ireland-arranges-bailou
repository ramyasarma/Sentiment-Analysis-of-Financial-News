The euro weakened, global stocks
extended losses into a fourth week and Spanish and Portuguese
bonds dropped as Ireland’s 85 billion-euro ($113 billion)
bailout failed to ease concern the region’s most-indebted
nations will need further aid.  The euro slid against its 16 major counterparts as of 4 p.m.
in New York. The MSCI World Index of equities in 24 developed
nations slipped 0.8 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
lost 0.1 percent, erasing most of an earlier drop of 1.3 percent
as banks rallied and the gauge rebounded above a chart level
watched by traders. Spain’s 10-year bond yield added 25 basis
points and Portugal’s climbed 14 basis points as the cost of
insuring the countries’ debt against default jumped to records.
Oil rallied 2.4 percent to $85.73 a barrel.  The MSCI World slumped below its lowest closing level since
Oct. 5 as concern over Europe’s debt crisis overshadowed
National Retail Federation data showing U.S. shoppers spent 6.4
percent more than last year over the holiday weekend. Declines
in global stocks over the past three weeks wiped out $2.3
trillion from  markets . Italy’s bonds slumped after the nation’s
borrowing costs rose at a sale of debt today.  “Investors are still very concerned about what happens
next, what happens to other countries, what happens to the
euro,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.5 billion as chief
investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. “It’s good to see
some positive surprises on the U.S. retail side. Still, Europe
is a story with legs. An Irish bailout might be a good short-
term event. However, it’s an ongoing negative.”  Euro, Franc  The euro declined 0.9 percent to $1.3120, after sinking to
a two-month low of $1.3064, and slid 0.7 percent versus the yen
and 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc. The franc advanced
against 13 of its 16 main counterparts.  The yield on Italian 10-year debt advanced 22 basis points
to 4.65 percent as the government auctioned 6.8 billion euros of
bonds due in 2013, 2017 and 2021. Credit-default swaps on
Portugal jumped 36.5 basis points to 538.4, and contracts on
Spain climbed 28.5 to 351.2, according to CMA. The Markit iTraxx
SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments increased
9.4 basis points to a record 197.5, based on closing prices.  Irish bonds fell, erasing earlier gains, to send the extra
yield investors demand to hold 10-year Irish bonds instead of
benchmark German bunds three basis points  higher , widening for
the seventh day. The cost of default swaps on Irish government
debt rose 5.3 basis points to 603.8, while contracts on Greece
dropped 5.9 basis points to 966.4, according to CMA.  ‘Far From Over’  “The choices are still between default, deliberate
devaluation and divorce from the euro,”  Kit Juckes , head of
foreign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA in London,
wrote in a report. “The weekend bailout offers a delay in
making these choices rather than providing the answers markets
were looking for. The bottom line is that the crisis is far from
over.”  The S&P 500 added to last week’s 0.9 percent retreat, while
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Coca-Cola Co. tumbled more than 1.2
percent to lead declines in 20 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.  The S&P 500 rebounded after its earlier decline today sent
the index as low as 1,173.64, below its 50-day moving average,
currently about 1,177, for the first time since September,
Bloomberg data show. Technical analysts who base investment
decisions on price charts say retreats below such levels often
lead to faster declines.  Economy Watch  Investors also awaited a U.S. jobs report forecast to show
employment increased by 145,000 workers this month after a
151,000 increase in October that marked the biggest advance
since May, according to the median forecast of 67 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Labor Department’s Dec. 3
report.  Manufacturing, the industry leading the U.S. recovery that
began in July 2009, expanded in November for a 16th consecutive
month, economists expect data released on Dec. 1 to show.  “Focus will revert back to equity markets given the deluge
of economic data due this week, which will set the tone for
December and the potential for a Christmas rally given the
resolution of the euro-zone sovereign crisis, at least for
now,” said  Rajeev Shah , a credit strategist at BNP Paribas SA
in London.  The MSCI World Index is trading at about 12.3 times the
estimated earnings of its companies for the next year, near the
16-month low of 11.4 reached in July, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Retail Sales  Retailers  in the S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent as a group.
About 212 million shoppers went to stores and websites over the
holiday weekend, spending $365.34 on average, the National
Retail Federation said yesterday. The proportion of sales online
rose to more than one-third of the total, the highest ever, the
trade group said.  Wells Fargo & Co.  climbed 2.1 percent to lead a rally in
banks after RBC Capital Markets said it expects the company to
be among the first group of lenders that regulators will allow
to increase dividends early next year.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slumped 1.7 percent, the most in
two weeks. Daimler AG, the world’s second-largest luxury
carmaker, dropped 3.4 percent. Banco Santander SA, Spain’s
biggest lender, slipped 2.7 percent. Bank of Ireland Plc soared
16 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.5 percent. Sony Corp.,
Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, added 2.8
percent as Nomura Holdings Inc. rated the stock a “buy.”
Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest automaker by sales,
climbed 1.5 percent.  Hungary Bear Market  Hungary’s BUX index dropped 2.6 percent to extend its
decline from its 2010 peak to more than 20 percent, making it
the first emerging-market stock gauge to enter a bear market
since global equities began falling this month. Turkey’s
benchmark index fell 3.1 percent, bringing its retreat from the
peak on Nov. 9 to 10 percent, the threshold for a so-called
correction.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  slipped less than 0.1
percent, erasing gains of as much as 0.7 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index retreated 0.3 percent after President Lee Myung Bak
said North Korea will be made to pay for any more provocation as
his nation and the U.S. held joint military exercises.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities rose 1.3 percent. Gold
futures gained, heading for the first gain in three days. Gold
for February settlement climbed 0.2 percent to $1,367.50 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
