             Triad Guaranty Inc. (TGIC) , the Winston-Salem,
North Carolina-based mortgage insurer, borrowed $80 million from a
 credit line  to preempt any cash shortages amid rising defaults on
U.S. home loans.  
 The company tapped the funds ``in light of current market
conditions,'' Triad said in a regulatory filing today. The insurer
said it has the option to increase its credit line by $20 million.  
 Triad  shares  have fallen 54 percent this year, compared with
the 4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's Smallcap 600 Index, as
mortgage foreclosure filings in the U.S. jumped 58 percent to
573,397 in the first half, according to Irvine, California-based
RealtyTrac Inc. Mortgage insurers protect lenders from borrower
defaults.  
 ``We're seeing an increase in defaults in Florida and
California along with the rest of the industry, but this is more to
demonstrate our financial flexibility than to meet any immediate
need,'' Triad Chief Financial Officer Ken Jones said in an
interview.  
 The company placed the funds in short-term investments, the
filing said.
