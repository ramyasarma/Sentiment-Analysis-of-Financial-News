             Investors should sell the pound
against the dollar, betting the U.K. currency will depreciate to
$1.40, according to UBS AG.  
 “There  are seven re asons to sell sterling,”  Gareth Berry ,
a strategist in Singapore, wrote in an e-mailed report received
today. Among the reasons, “the rest of the Bank of England
Monetary Policy Committee is unlikely to join Andrew Sentance in
voting for rate hikes,” he said. “The beneficial impact of
last month’s budget has now been priced into sterling. Third,
the scale of the budget cuts forecast for the next four years
will undermine growth.”  
 The pound declined 0.7 percent to $1.4963 as of 7:46 a.m.
in London, falling to less than $1.50 for the first time since
July 1.  
 UBS said investors should end the trade should the U.K.
currency climb to more than $1.5270.
