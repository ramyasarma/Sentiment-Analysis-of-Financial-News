             Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin ’s
political action committee raised $865,815 in the year’s second
quarter and she used some of that money to help a primary
challenger to incumbent Senator  Lisa Murkowski , a fellow
Republican, in her home state.  
 Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, gave
$82,500 through her PAC to Republican candidates from April
through June, including $5,000 to lawyer Joe Miller, who is
challenging Murkowski in Alaska’s Aug. 24 primary. Palin’s PAC
gave $5,000 to Murkowski’s campaign last year, before Miller
entered the race.  
 Palin, 46, defeated Murkowski’s father, then-Governor  Frank Murkowski , in the state’s 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary,
and won the office that November. Palin resigned from the
governorship a year ago.  
 Frank Murkowski , 77, appointed his daughter to succeed him
in the Senate in 2002 when he was elected governor, and Lisa
Murkowski, 53, won a full six-year term in 2004.  
 Miller, a former federal judge, has criticized Murkowski
for her support of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was
passed by Congress in late 2008 and provided U.S. tax funds to
help banks and other companies.  
 Palin’s Praise  
 On her Facebook page, Palin said that “contested primaries
are so good for America’s political process.” She praised
Miller as a “bold reformer who is not afraid to stand up to
special interests.”  
 Murkowski’s campaign spokesman, Steve Wackowski, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  
 Palin’s PAC also gave $5,000 to ex-professional football
player Clint Didier, who is opposing former state senator  Dino Rossi  in Washington state’s Aug. 17 Republican primary for the
right to take on incumbent Democratic Senator  Patty Murray .  
 Primary winners who were backed by Palin’s PAC include
 Sharron Angle , who won the Republican nomination in Nevada last
month to run against Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a
Democrat. Palin’s PAC contributed $2,500 to Angle, a former
state lawmaker who also was supported by Tea Party activists in
her race against 10 other Republicans.  
 The PAC also gave $4,000 to Vaughn Ward in Idaho, who lost
the Republican nomination for the state’s sole U.S. House seat
to state Representative Paul Labrador in a May primary. The
incumbent is freshman  Walt Minnick , considered by analysts as
one of the most vulnerable House Democrats.  
 Between Jan. 1 and June 30, SarahPAC raised $1.3 million.  
 Palin is a potential 2012 Republican presidential
candidate. While individuals can’t spend PAC money on their own
campaigns, they can use it to make donations and to travel on
behalf of candidates for federal, state and local office.
