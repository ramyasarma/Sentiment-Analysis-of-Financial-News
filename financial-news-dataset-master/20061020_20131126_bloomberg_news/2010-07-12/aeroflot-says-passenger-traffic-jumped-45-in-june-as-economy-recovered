             OAO Aeroflot, Russia’s largest
airline, said passenger traffic jumped 45 percent in June from
the same month last year as the economy recovered from the
steepest decline on record.  
 Aeroflot carried 1.1 million last month, compared with
758,084 in June 2009, the state-run company said today in an e-
mailed statement.
