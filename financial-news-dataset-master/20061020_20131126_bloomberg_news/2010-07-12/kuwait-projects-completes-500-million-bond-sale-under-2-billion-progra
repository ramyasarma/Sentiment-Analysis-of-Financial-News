             Kuwait Projects Co.  said it raised
$500 million by selling 10-years bonds to gain access to long-
term funds in the first global issue by a private company in the
Middle East and North Africa this year.  
 The bonds received $1.8 billion in bids and were priced at
644.2 basis points over the U.S. dollar mid-swap rate and 647.3
basis points over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, Kuwait’s
biggest privately-owned investment company known as Kipco said
in an e-mailed statement today. The bonds were sold under
Kipco’s $2 billion euro medium term note program and carry a
fixed-rate coupon of 9.375 percent, it said.  
 The sale is “the first international bond issue by a
private sector corporate from the Middle East and North Africa
region in 2010, as well as the first US dollar denominated
offering from a Kuwaiti institution since 2009,” Kipco said. The
money will be “used to extend the company’s maturity profile and
further diversify KIPCO’s investor base,” it said.  
 BNP Paribas SA,  Citigroup Inc  and HSBC Holdings Plc managed
the bond sale. The bonds are rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service, its second-lowest investment grade score, Kipco said.  
 Companies in the six Arab countries that make up the Gulf
Cooperation Council, including the United Arab Emirates and
Kuwait, have raised $8.2 billion from bond sales so far this
year compared with $15.5 billion from bond sales in the first-
half of last year, according to Bloomberg data.
