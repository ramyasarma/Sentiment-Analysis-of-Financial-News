             Time Warner Inc.  is consolidating
the online operations of its Sports Illustrated magazine and
Turner Sports to challenge Internet sports destination ESPN.com.  
 Sports Illustrated will continue to create all editorial
content, and Turner Sports will handle the technical operations,
ad sales and marketing for  SI.com , New York-based Time Warner
said today in a statement.  
 The partnership between the Time Inc. magazine and Turner
Broadcasting cable-television units further cements Time
Warner’s grab for more of the sports entertainment market. In
April, Turner and  CBS Corp.  agreed to a $10.8 billion, 14-year
contract for the broadcast, Internet and wireless rights to the
men’s college basketball championship tournament. New York-based
CBS and Turner outbid  Walt Disney Co. ’s ESPN.  
 Time Warner said the partnership will create new revenue
and marketing opportunities for SI.com, Golf.com and Turner’s 19
sports and entertainment websites, including those for Nascar
racing and professional baseball and basketball. The units will
also work together to produce new mobile products and
applications. Sports Illustrated already produces a tablet
version of its content for  Apple Inc. ’s iPad.  
 Time Warner fell 9 cents to $30.10 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 3.3
percent this year. Burbank, California-based Disney added 2
cents to $33.77.
