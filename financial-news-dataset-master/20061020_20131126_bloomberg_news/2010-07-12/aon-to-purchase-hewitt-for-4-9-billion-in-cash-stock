             Aon Corp. , the world’s largest
insurance broker, led decliners in the Standard & Poor’s 500
after agreeing to buy  Hewitt Associates Inc.  for $4.9 billion.  
 Aon fell $2.72, or 7.1 percent, to $35.62 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest drop in
more than a year. The cash-and-stock deal values Hewitt at $50 a
share, or 41 percent more than the consulting firm’s closing
price on July 9, Chicago-based Aon said in a statement today.
Hewitt soared 32 percent, or $11.39, to $46.79.  
 “In the short term it’s a negative,” said  Meyer Shields ,
an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., who has a “buy” rating
on Aon’s stock. “Integrations are always messy, and Aon is
using an undervalued stock to pay for it.”  
 Chief Executive Officer  Greg Case , 47, is more than
doubling the size of Aon’s consulting business as  Marsh &
McLennan Cos. , the second-biggest insurance broker, is scaling
back its advisory activity. Consulting firms are under pressure
to grow after benefits-consulting company Towers Watson & Co.
was formed this year in a $3.5 billion merger.  
 Aon will pay $25.61 in cash and 0.6362 of a share for each
Hewitt share. Aon’s share slide was the most since it fell 14
percent on May 1, 2009.  
 The purchase is Aon’s  biggest , surpassing its $1.4 billion
acquisition of reinsurance broker Benfield Group Ltd. in 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, which
earns commissions by matching buyers and sellers of insurance,
is seeking to boost  revenue  with the purchase of Hewitt, which
provides payroll and consulting services to 3,000 clients.  
 ‘Stick to Insurance’  
 “Aon’s acquisition significantly expands its consulting
revenue base at a time when we think it should be decreased,”
 Rob Haines , an analyst with CreditSights Inc., said today in a
research note. “Insurance companies should stick to
insurance.”  
 Aon may be downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service on the
deal, the ratings firm said in a statement. Moody’s changed the
outlook on Aon’s Baa2 debt rating to negative from stable.  
 “This is about growth and building our firm,” Case said
on a conference call. In consulting, “we really weren’t exactly
where we thought we might be able to be, which is why we started
to think who would be the best partner in that space.”  
 Aon will merge Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Hewitt with its
Aon Consulting unit and rename the division Aon Hewitt. The
company said it expects to reap $355 million in annual savings
by cutting back-office costs and overlapping managers.  Russ Fradin , chairman and CEO of Hewitt, will head the division and
report to Case, who was a consultant with McKinsey & Co. before
replacing Patrick Ryan as Aon’s CEO in 2005.  
 Job Cuts  
 “The way that consulting is run is often different from
other businesses, and you have to have senior management that
understands that,” said  Peter Bendor-Samuel , CEO of Everest
Group, a Dallas-based consulting firm that advises companies on
outsourcing strategies. “It influenced Case and also gives some
comfort to investors.”  
 Aon will cut jobs for “redundancies” following the
transaction, Case said.  
 Consulting revenue at Aon fell about 7 percent last year to
$1.3 billion. New York-based Marsh & McLennan’s consulting
 division , which includes the units Mercer and Oliver Wyman,
posted about $4.6 billion in revenue last year, down 11 percent
from 2008.  
 More Consulting  
 The acquisition is going make Aon more of a consulting
operation, said  Paul Newsome , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP in Chicago. “There’s going to be some scale
benefits. The other thing they get is better recognition. I
think from a pure consulting perspective, Hewitt is a better
name than Aon.”  
 Marsh & McLennan agreed to sell its Kroll security-
consulting business for $1.13 billion in June. The firm, led by
CEO  Brian Duperreault , is expanding its flagship insurance
brokerage business by acquiring smaller middlemen.  
 Aon said it’s paying about 7.5 times Hewitt’s forecast
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for the 2010 fiscal year.  Credit Suisse Group AG  and  Morgan
Stanley  will arrange a $1 billion three-year term loan and a
$1.5 billion bridge loan.  
 “The proposed funding structure would more than double
Aon’s debt burden and reduce its financial flexibility,”  Bruce Ballentine , a Moody’s analyst, said in the ratings firm’s
statement.  
 Credit Suisse acted as a financial adviser to Aon and
 Citigroup Inc . advised Hewitt on the deal. Aon said it expects
to complete the purchase by mid-November.
