             Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s election
loss could lead to a downgrade of Japan’s credit rating should
it hamper his ability to address the world’s largest public debt,
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service said.  
 The Democratic Party of Japan’s upper-house defeat
yesterday is “potentially negative” because of legislative
gridlock,  Takahira Ogawa , director of sovereign ratings at
Standard & Poor’s in Singapore, said in a phone interview today.
Any ensuing political turmoil might have “negative rating
implications,”  Thomas Byrne , senior vice president at Moody’s
in Singapore, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  
 Kan campaigned on a pledge to tackle the government’s
 record debt  by cutting spending and raising the nation’s 5
percent sales tax. The ruling coalition lost its majority in the
chamber, and it lacks two-thirds of members in the more-powerful
lower house, making it hard to pass laws without support from
opposition parties.  
 “It will be difficult for the government to push through
the necessary reforms and restructuring in the public sector and
the taxation system,” Ogawa said. Still, he said it remains
possible Kan will be able to work with other parties. Losing
control of the upper house “doesn’t necessarily mean that the
government cannot do any meaningful policy,” he said.  
 Watching the Election  
 Both Ogawa and Byrne said they will watch the DPJ’s
leadership election in September. Kan said he doesn’t plan to
step down as party president.  
 Byrne said the election loss “could have negative rating
implications if it leads to renewed leadership instability and a
wavering of commitment by the ruling party for fiscal discipline
and deficit reduction, or an ebbing in confidence in government
policy or in the economy.”  
 Moody’s has an Aa2 rating on Japan’s sovereign debt, and
S&P carries an AA grade. Both are the third-highest levels.  
 Fitch Ratings said it is too early to determine how the
election might affect its AA- local currency rating for Japan,
according to  Andrew Colquhoun , director at the company’s Asia-
Pacific sovereign group.  
 ‘More Complicated’  
 “The coalition’s loss of its majority in the upper house
will make it more complicated to build necessary parliamentary
support for fiscal consolidation,” Colquhoun said by e-mail.
“But I still view it as possible that the parties can find
enough common ground to work towards that goal. The outlook on
the ratings remains stable, but Fitch looks for a credible
fiscal consolidation plan to head off longer-term pressures on
Japan’s creditworthiness.”  
 S&P downgraded the outlook on Japan’s credit in January,
citing the lack of a plan by Kan’s predecessor  Yukio Hatoyama  to
address the country’s record  debt burden . In June, Kan released
a fiscal strategy that included halving the annual budget
deficit by 2015 and balancing the books by 2020.  
 Ogawa responded to that plan by saying he needs “more
numbers and more specific policies.” Japan remains “very
vulnerable,” he said on June 22.  
 “Effective policy measures to increase revenue and reduce
expenditure to achieve fiscal consolidation are key,” S&P wrote
in a statement today. “If the fiscal position of the government
erodes further, or there is a lack of concrete measures aimed at
fiscal consolidation, we may lower the sovereign ratings on
Japan.”

     Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan lost control of parliament’s upper house, undermining legislative efforts to cut the world’s largest public debt and creating the possibility of a third leadership change in a year. The ruling Democratic Party of Japan won 44 seats, compared with 51 for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, according to results compiled by public broadcaster NHK.
