             Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, reported sales to dealers in China fell 2.7
percent in June as  strikes  at parts makers led the automaker
to suspend production, creating a shortage of vehicles.  
 Sales fell to 50,113 units in the month, according to an
e-mailed statement today, while rising demand for cars pushed
up sales 22 percent in the first half of the year, from the
same period a year earlier. Honda’s China sales also fell
10.3 percent in May from a year earlier, the company said.  
 Honda’s declines in sales come after it announced in May
that it would raise production capacity in China by 28
percent to 839,000 vehicles a year by the second half of 2012
and introduce two new models to take advantage of rising
demand. China’s wholesale passenger car sales rose 19 percent
in June to 1.04 million units, according to a July 9 report
by the  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers .  
 At least eight strikes in the past two months at parts
suppliers to Honda, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.
have forced the automakers to suspend production for days or
hours. Before May, Honda’s last monthly sales decline was in
March 2009 as the financial crisis undermined demand,
according to the company.  
 Honda closed two plants in Guangzhou, Guangdong province
on May 24 and factories in Guangzhou and Wuhan, Hubei
province, on May 26 after 1,850 workers at a parts-making
unit went on strike for higher wages. The four factories
resumed production June 5.  
 Honda gained 3.1 percent to close at 2,687 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The shares have dropped 14 percent this
year, compared with a 9.5 percent decline in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average.
