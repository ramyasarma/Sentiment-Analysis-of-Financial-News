             The three Czech parties that pledged
to cut state spending signed a coalition agreement under which
they will create a majority government with an aim to curb the
 budget  deficit.  
 With the accord, the Civic Democrats, TOP09 and Public
Affairs closed talks on a program after winning May 28-29
elections. The parties, who have already divided up Cabinet
posts, will have 118 of the 200 seats in parliament, the largest
majority since the country became an independent state in 1993.  
 President  Vaclav Klaus  said he will name the new Cabinet,
led by Prime Minister  Petr Necas  of the Civic Democrats, in
Prague tomorrow at 10 a.m. According to the Constitution, the
government must seek a vote of confidence within 30 days of
being appointed.  
 The three parties already agreed to limit the public
finance deficit at 4.8 percent of  gross domestic product  next
year, compared with 5.3 percent targeted for this year. Necas
said on June 30 that the 2011 shortfall shouldn’t exceed 4.6
percent and that the government will aim to bring the gap to
within the European Union’s limit of 3 percent by 2013.
