             Corn futures may decline in Chicago
after the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that the
nation’s stockpiles will be bigger than analysts expected.  
 Corn for December delivery was little changed at $3.955 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:11 p.m. in London.
Prices dropped 0.3 percent on July 9.  
 Corn reserves in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, will be 1.373 billion bushels, the USDA said in the
report on July 9. The USDA estimates were “not as bullish as
expected,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a report
published today.  
 The U.S. agency also raised its estimate for U.S. soybean
production to 3.345 billion bushels, up 35 million, as the area
harvested was forecast to expand to a record 78 million acres
(31.6 million hectares).  
 Soybeans for November delivery lost 0.3 percent to $9.5075
a bushel.  
 September-delivery wheat was 0.1 percent higher at $5.3875
a bushel. Wheat futures earlier gained as much as 0.7 percent as
dry weather persisted in Russia and Kazakhstan, raising concern
that global supply may be smaller than estimated by the USDA.  
 Milling wheat futures for November delivery declined 0.6
percent to 160 euros ($201) a metric ton on Liffe in Paris.  
 The USDA on July 9 cut its estimate of global stockpiles
of wheat at the end of the 2010-2011 marketing year by
6.9 million tons to 187 million tons from a month earlier. The
agency pared output estimates for some exporters including
Russia and Kazakhstan on concern dry weather will curb yields.
