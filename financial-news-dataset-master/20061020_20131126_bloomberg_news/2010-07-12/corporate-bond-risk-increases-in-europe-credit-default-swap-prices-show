             The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 8.5
basis points to 537, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at
10:30 a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and an increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2 basis points to 117.25, JPMorgan
prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from default also
increased, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks
and insurers up 4 at 135.5 and the subordinated index 11 higher
at 213.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
