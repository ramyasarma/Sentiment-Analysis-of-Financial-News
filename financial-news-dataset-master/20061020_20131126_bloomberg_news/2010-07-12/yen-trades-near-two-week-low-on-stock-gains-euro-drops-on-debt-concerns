             The yen erased earlier losses
against the euro and the dollar as a slide in Chinese stocks
boosted demand for the relative safety of Japan’s currency.  
 The yen traded at 111.55 per euro as of 12:28 p.m. in Tokyo
from 111.62 yesterday in New York, after earlier falling to
112.08. Japan’s currency was at 88.58 per dollar from 88.62.
