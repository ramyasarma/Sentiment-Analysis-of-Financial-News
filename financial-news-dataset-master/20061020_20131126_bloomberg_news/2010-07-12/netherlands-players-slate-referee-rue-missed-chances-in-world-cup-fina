             The Netherlands blamed English
referee  Howard Webb  and missed chances for their defeat in
yesterday’s soccer World Cup final in South Africa.  
 Winger  Arjen Robben  and midfielder  Nigel de Jong  questioned
calls made by Webb, and particularly his decision to wave play
on when Robben appeared to have been pulled back in front of the
Spanish goal. Spain’s winner, four minutes before the end of
extra time, came moments after the Netherlands was denied a
corner following a free kick that bounced off their opponents’
wall, prompting Dutch players to confront the linesman.  
 “If you have a World Cup final you need a World Cup
referee,” said Robben. The Netherlands are now the only nation
to have played in three World Cup finals and lost them all.  
 Robben’s criticism of the referee was echoed by midfielder
 Wesley Sneijder  and Dutch coach  Bert van Marwijk  in a game that
was littered with fouls, including a 13-minute spell during the
first half when five players were booked. Netherlands defender
 John Heitinga  was red carded in extra time and in total a record
14 yellow cards were issued, including the two that led to the
dismissal.  
 “It’s the final and everybody wants to win the game,”
said De Jong. “You have to go to the limits sometimes,
sometimes you have to put in a hard tackle.”  
 Even so, the squandered chances prompted Van Marwijk to say
that the “best team won.”  
 Bayern Munich winger Robben, who missed the two clearest
chances created by either team during regulation time, took
responsibility for the first miss, when he failed to find the
back of the net with only goalkeeper  Iker Casillas  to beat.  
 “The first one was clearly my fault,” he told reporters.
“The second chance was a sending off, there was no advantage,”
said Robben, referring to Webb’s decision not to award a free
kick as Spain’s defenders hauled him back.  
 “We did this to ourselves, I guess,” Dutch coach Van
Marwijk conceded after the match. “It’s very bitter in defeat
and very sad.”
