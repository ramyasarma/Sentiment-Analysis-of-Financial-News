             A scheduled joint navy drill by the
U.S. and South Korea in the Yellow Sea is “hostile to China,”
 Li Jie , a researcher at the Chinese navy’s military academy,
wrote in a commentary published in today’s China Daily newspaper.  
 A spate of recent activity by U.S. aircraft carriers is a
reminder of unfriendly moves by its navy in the waters of the
Yellow Sea since the 1990s, Li wrote.
