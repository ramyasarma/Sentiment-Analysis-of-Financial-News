             Zodiac Aerospace SA needs no partner
and can continue growing on its own, Chief Executive Officer
Oliver Zarrouati told Les Echos in an interview published today.
The company rejected a takeover approach from Safran SA because
a combination would “create no synergies,” Zarrouati said,
adding that he doesn’t expect Safran to make a hostile bid on
Zodiac.
