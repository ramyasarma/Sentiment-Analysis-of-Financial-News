             OAO Seventh Continent  advanced by
the most in almost two weeks after Kommersant reported the
Moscow-based food retailer will get a $650 million credit line
from Alfa Bank.  
 Majority owner  Alexander Zanadvorov  restructured a $560
million personal debt to a group of banks, according to
Kommersant, citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t
identify.  
 Seventh Continent traded 6.6 percent higher at 270 rubles
at 10:41 a.m. in Moscow, the biggest intraday gain since June
30. The stock earlier jumped by as much as 8.5 percent.
