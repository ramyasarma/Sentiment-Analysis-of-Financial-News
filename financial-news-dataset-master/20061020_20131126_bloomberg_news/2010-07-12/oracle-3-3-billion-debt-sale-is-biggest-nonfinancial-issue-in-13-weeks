             Oracle Corp ., the world’s second-
largest software maker, sold $3.25 billion of bonds in two parts
in its first offering in more than a year and the biggest debt
sale by a nonfinancial borrower in 13 weeks.  
 The company’s $1 billion of 3.875 percent 10-year notes
yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and
its $2.25 billion of 5.375 percent 30-year bonds pay a 140
basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Oracle will apply proceeds to repay debt due in January
2011, to replenish cash used to pay debt that matured in May,
and for general corporate purposes, according to a person
familiar with the transaction, who declined to be identified
citing lack of authorization to publicly comment on the sale.  
 The software maker, which has acquired 67 companies since
the start of 2005, “views this as an advantageous time to lock
in some long-term funding,” said  Dave Novosel , an analyst with
corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit.  
 “Oracle likes to keep a lot of cash on hand just in case
there are opportunities in terms of acquisitions,” Novosel,
based in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “This gives
them more flexibility in the capital structure, pushing debt
further out.”  
 Sun Purchase  
 The company sold $4.5 billion of debt in June 2009 to help
finance its acquisition of Sun Microsystems Inc., which was
completed in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The $7.3 billion purchase helped boost fourth-quarter profit at
the company. Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, had $1
billion of floating-rate notes that matured in May and has $2.2
billion of debt coming due in January, according to a July 1
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Today’s offering is the biggest by a nonfinancial issuer in
the U.S. corporate market since  Telefonica SA , Europe’s second-
largest phone company, issued $3.5 billion of debt in April
through its financing affiliate, Bloomberg data show. Including
financial issuance, the previous biggest offering was on July 7,
when Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, the German development
bank, sold $5 billion of securities.  
 Deborah Hellinger  and  Karen Tillman , spokeswomen for
Oracle, didn’t return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment on
the offering.  
 Oracle issued $1.75 billion of 10-year notes last year that
priced at 99.627 cents on the dollar to yield 5.052 percent, or
a 155 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The company sold
$1.25 billion of 30-year bonds that priced at 99.334 cents on
the dollar to yield 6.175 percent, or a 185 basis-point spread,
the data show.  
 Outstanding Bonds Decline  
 The debt due in 2039 fell 3.53 cents to 112.082 cents on
the dollar, raising its yield to 5.27 percent, or 123.6 basis
points more than benchmarks, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The notes due in 2019 fell 0.41 cent on the dollar to yield 3.65
percent, a 58.1 basis-point spread, Trace data show.  
 The company sold more 30-year bonds than it has ever
previously issued, Bloomberg data show.  
 As of May 31, $16.6 billion of Oracle’s more than $18
billion in cash and securities were held by foreign divisions,
Standard & Poor’s said in a note today.  
 “Whatever their balance is, it’s not always readily
available, because it’s tough to repatriate it from foreign
countries sometimes because of tax consequences,” Novosel said.
“That’s another reason they’d prefer to issue here.”  
 The notes are rated A by S&P, five levels below the top
investment grade and may be given an equivalent A2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.  
 ‘Financial Flexibility’  
 “Oracle has sufficient financial flexibility to fund
ongoing acquisitions and share repurchases from cash on hand and
available liquidity sources without materially weakening its
financial profile,” S&P analysts wrote in the note.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BNP
Paribas managed the sale for the company, the person said.  
 Microsoft Corp ., the world’s largest software maker, raised
$1.15 billion of interest-free financing from its first sale of
convertible bonds last month, Bloomberg data show. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.
