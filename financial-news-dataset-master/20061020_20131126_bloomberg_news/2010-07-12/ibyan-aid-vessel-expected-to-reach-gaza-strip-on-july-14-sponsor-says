             A Libyan vessel carrying
humanitarian aid is expected to reach the Hamas-controlled Gaza
Strip by noon on July 14, said the group behind the plan to
challenge Israel’s naval blockade of the Palestinian territory.  
 “The boat is heading for Gaza and we hope every party
concerned will be helpful in the ship reaching its
destination,” Youssef Sawani, executive director of the Gaddafi
International Charity and Development Foundation, which is
mounting the operation, said in a telephone interview from
Greece today. The charity is headed by  Saif al-Islam Qaddafi ,
son of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  
 Nine pro-Palestinian activists from Turkey were killed on
May 31 after Israeli commandos raided one of six aid ships in a
flotilla trying to breach the embargo. Israel loosened its
restrictions on the transport of goods by road into Gaza in
response to international criticism of the operation, though it
maintains a naval blockade of the area.  
 The Libyan-chartered aid ship left Greece on July 9 and is
now in international waters, Sawani said.  
 Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said in an
interview on Army Radio yesterday that the boat would not be
allowed to reach Gaza under “any circumstances.”  
 Israel and Egypt have been blockading Gaza since Hamas
seized full control there in 2007 after winning Palestinian
parliamentary elections the previous year. The Islamist militant
group is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., the
European Union and Israel.
