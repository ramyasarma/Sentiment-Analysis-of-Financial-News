             Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named  Michael Kushma  chief investment
officer for global fixed-income in the bank’s asset-management
unit.  
 Kushma, who joined the firm in 1987, is co-head of the
global and European fixed income team for  Morgan Stanley
Investment Management , the New York-based bank said today in a
statement. He will oversee the asset-management unit’s fixed-
income strategies, according to the statement.  
 The group had $56 billion in fixed-income assets  under
management  as of March 31, an increase of about 10 percent from
a year earlier. Morgan Stanley sold its retail asset-management
business, including the Van Kampen funds, to Invesco Ltd. last
month to focus on institutional funds.  
 “A robust fixed income capability is key to MSIM’s ability
to serve clients across multiple asset classes,”  Gregory Fleming , who was hired last year as president of the unit, said
in the statement. “We continue to see strong momentum across
our entire long-only business, including fixed income where we
have garnered positive flows as a result of strong
performance.”  
 Morgan Stanley also hired Sara Fuber as chief operating
officer of the long-only business,  Jim Janover  as global head of
risk for the investment-management unit and  Lisa Jones  as its
global head of sales, according to the statement. The firm also
hired  Navtej Nandra  to lead Morgan Stanley Investment Management
International.
