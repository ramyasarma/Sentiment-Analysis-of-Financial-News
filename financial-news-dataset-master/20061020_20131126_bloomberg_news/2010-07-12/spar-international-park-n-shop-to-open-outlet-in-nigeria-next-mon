             Spar International , Europe’s largest
voluntary supermarket network, will open its first store in
Nigeria in August, according to a company official who declined
to be named in line with Spar’s policy.  
 Park ‘n’ Shop , a Nigerian retailer owned by Artee Group,
signed an agreement to operate the Spar license in the West
African nation, the official at the Amsterdam-based company said
by phone today, declining to provide further information.  
 The outlet will be located in the Lekki district of the
commercial capital, Lagos,  BusinessDay  reported today, without
saying how it got the information.  
 The retailer plans to open more outlets in the capital,
Abuja, and the oil industry hub of Port Harcourt in the Niger
Delta area, the Lagos-based newspaper reported.
