             Statistics scheduled for release this
week may show China’s  economic growth  slowed in the second-quarter
as compared with the first three-months of the year.  
 China’s economy may have expanded 10.5 percent in the three-
month period ended June 30, according to the median estimate of 28
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with a growth pace
of 11.9 percent in the first quarter and 10.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year.  
 The government has cracked down on speculation in the
nation’s  housing market  and raised requirements for mortgage loans
in a bid to curb home price gains. That combined with the waning
effects of a government stimulus package introduced at the end of
2008 and the debt crisis in Europe, China’s biggest export market,
may led to slowing economic growth.  
 New yuan-denominated  loans  were 603.4 billion yuan ($89
billion) last month, less than the 639.4 billion yuan of lending
in May, the Chinese central bank said yesterday. M2, the broadest
measure of money supply, slowed for the seventh straight month in
June, growing 18.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the
 People’s Bank of China .  
 China’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest, rose
the least in 11 years in the second quarter. Holdings rose by $7.2
billion to $2.454 trillion at the end of June from the end of
March, the central bank said. Reserves dropped 2 percent in May,
according to data posted to the central bank’s website, the first
monthly decline since February 2009.  
 Chinese exports posted an unexpected rebound in June.
Overseas sales gained 43.9 percent last month from a year ago to
$137.4 billion while the trade surplus more than doubled to $20
billion, the highest level in eight months, the General
Administration of Customs said July 10.  
 Rate Swaps Dropped  
 China’s interest-rate swaps dropped last week after the
central bank said it favored policies to bolster economic growth,
prompting speculation it will delay increases in borrowing costs.  
 The People’s Bank of China said on July 8 it would stick to a
moderately loose monetary policy as growth becomes better balanced
between consumption, investment and exports. It has added cash to
the money market for seven consecutive weeks via open-market
operations.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps, which measure the fixed cost to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell 5 basis
points last week to 2.23 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Contracts due in three years receded 2 basis points in
five days to 2.67 percent.  
 Bonds Advanced  
 Government bonds advanced last week on easier liquidity
between banks. The yield on the 2.53 percent note due in June 2015
slid 4 basis points to 2.59 percent, and the price of the security
added 0.18 per 100 yuan face amount to 99.72, the funding center
data showed.  
 China’s stocks posted their biggest weekly gains this year on
Friday, on speculation the government will wind back tightening
measures that helped make the gauge Asia’s worst performer in 2010.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.3 percent. Poly Real
Estate Co. paced gains by developers after the central bank said
it will stick to a moderately loose monetary policy and the
Oriental Morning Post reported some Shanghai banks have resumed
lending to third-home buyers. PetroChina Co. and Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. led an advance by energy producers, China’s worst
performers this year.  
 Stock Index Climbed  
 The Shanghai Composite, which tracks the bigger of China’s
two stock exchanges, climbed 55.77, or 2.3 percent, to close at
2,470.92 on Friday. Last week’s gain was the most since the final
week of 2009, when the gauge advanced 4.3 percent. The index
traded at 17.6 times reported earnings at the end of last week,
the lowest in 18 months.  
 The yuan traded at 6.7716 per dollar on Friday, little
changed from 6.7761 a day earlier and 6.7711 a week ago, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency has
strengthened 0.8 percent since the central bank loosened control
of the exchange rate on June 19.
