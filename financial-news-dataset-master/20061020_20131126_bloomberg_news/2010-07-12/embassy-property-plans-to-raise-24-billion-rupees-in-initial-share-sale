             Embassy Property Developers Ltd.
plans to raise 24 billion rupees ($513 million) in an initial
public offering in India, according to a share sale document.  
 The company, based in Bangalore, is considering a pre-IPO
placement of 11.8 billion rupees, according to a  draft sale
prospectus  today. UBS Securities India Pvt., Nomura Financial
Advisory & Securities (India) Pvt., Citigroup Global Markets
India Pvt. and  Edelweiss Capital Ltd . were hired to manage the
offering, the document posted on Edelweiss’s website showed.  
 Embassy plans to use the funds to finance construction of
projects and repay loans. The developer may face competition in
tapping investors from rivals including Lodha Developers Ltd.
and Sahara Prime City Ltd. as at least nine developers are
planning to raise money, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company may also struggle to lure investors who have
shunned property stocks in India this year, leading to a 13
percent decline in the  Bombay Stock Exchange Realty Index ,
compared with a 2.7 percent advance in the Sensitive Index.
