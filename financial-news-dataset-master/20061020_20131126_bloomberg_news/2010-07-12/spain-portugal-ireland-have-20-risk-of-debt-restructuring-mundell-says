             Spain , Portugal and Ireland face a
20 percent risk of having to restructure their public debt while
the likelihood is 40 percent for Greece and 10 percent for
Italy, Nobel Prize-winning economist  Robert Mundell  said.  
 “I don’t think it’s going to happen immediately, but it
might come in the next year or so,” Mundell, a Columbia
University professor who won the Nobel Prize in 1999 for
research that helped lay the foundation for Europe’s single
currency, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in
Siena, Italy, yesterday. “I suppose the risk countries include
Portugal, Ireland and Spain.”  
 European governments are fighting to rein in their budget
deficits and stem a surge in  borrowing  costs prompted by
contagion from Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis. Greece’s public
debt amounted to 115 percent of its economic output last year,
compared with 53 percent for Spain, which is struggling to put
its public finances in order amid a 20 percent  unemployment  rate
and one of the highest private debt burdens in the euro region.  
 The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
debt rather than German equivalents surged to a euro-era high of
233 basis points on June 17, 10 times the average spread over
the last decade, before easing to 209 basis points today. The
risk premium on  Greek  debt is 768 basis points.  
 Worst Over  
 Still, Mundell said the worst may be over for Europe,
supporting the euro currency.  
 “We’ve heard most of the bad news about Europe, not all of
it, but most of it, and for that reason the euro-dollar rate is
in more stable permanent territory than otherwise,” he said.  
 The euro fell almost 20 percent in the six months to June
7, when it traded at a four-year low of $1.1877 to the dollar.
The single currency has since regained ground to trade at
$1.2575 as of 2:45 p.m. today.  
 “I was glad to see the euro come back to the $1.20, $1.25,
$1.30 range,” Mundell said. “This is a much better range for
it because going down to $1.18 is exaggerating the risks to the
euro.”  
 Investors betting on a euro breakup “are going to lose
their money,” he said. “And I think also those people who were
betting on the price of gold going up to $2,000 an ounce are
going to lose their money, too.”
