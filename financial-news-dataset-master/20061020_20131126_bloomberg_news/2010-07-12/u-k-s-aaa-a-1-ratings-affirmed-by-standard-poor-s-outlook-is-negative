             Standard & Poor’s maintained its
negative outlook on Britain’s top credit rating, saying its
projections for the economy are less optimistic than those in
last month’s emergency budget. The pound fell.  
 “The coalition government has set out what we view as a
strong framework for fiscal consolidation,” London-based S&P
analysts  Trevor Cullinan  and  David Beers  said in a research
report today, affirming the AAA credit rating. “There is still
a material risk that the U.K.’s net general government debt
burden may approach a level incompatible with the AAA rating.”  
 U.K. government bonds surged on June 22 after Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  pledged to balance the budget by
the end of the government’s first term, raising speculation the
measures will help preserve the top credit rating. S&P had said
March 29 that the nation needed a “strong fiscal consolidation
plan” to control its debt burden.  
 “There’s a difference between what is planned and what is
delivered, and I guess S&P needs to see real action before they
change the outlook,” said  Sean Maloney , a fixed-income
strategist at Nomura International Plc in London. “The fiscal
plan by the new government is in the direction that’s favored by
ratings agencies, and that helped ease the pressure on credit
standing in the near term.”  
 The pound slid 0.3 percent to $1.5014 at 4:45 p.m. in
London and pared a gain versus the euro to trade at 83.71 pence
after the S&P statement today. The 10-year gilt yield was less
than one basis point higher at 3.34 percent.  
 “We will continue to review the rating in light of further
information over the coming months about the extent of the
expenditure-led fiscal consolidation,” the S&P analysts wrote.
“A number of large and politically challenging spending
decisions are still to be made.”
