             Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., which
has a 10 percent stake in the leaking Gulf of Mexico Macondo
well, won’t pay BP Plc for cleanup costs until the cause of the
disaster and other details are known, Nikkei English News said,
without citing anyone.   
 BP wants the Mitsui & Co. unit to pay $111 million, the
Nikkei said.
