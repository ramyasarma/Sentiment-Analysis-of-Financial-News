             Cagamas Bhd ., the Malaysian national
mortgage company, plans to sell as much as 5 billion ringgit
($1.6 billion) of Islamic bonds.  
 The company, based in Kuala Lumpur, will publish details
about a program for so-called sukuk sales tomorrow and hasn’t
yet decided when to issue the first notes, Chief Executive
Officer  Steven Choy  said in a phone interview today.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is an arranger of the
program, Choy said. Saudi Arabia’s Al-Rajhi Bank and Malaysia’s
RHB Bank Bhd. will also help arrange Cagamas’s Sukuk Al-Amanah
Li-Al Istithmar sales, Malaysia’s official Bernama news agency
reported today.  
 Cagamas is developing a new type of sukuk that will appeal
to investors in the Middle East, Choy said in a May 26 interview.
Sukuk use asset returns to pay investors to comply with Islam’s
ban on interest.
