             The Czech Republic has further
delayed its planned sale of bonds in euros until at least
September because of the July and August holidays.  
 The offering of at least 1 billion euros ($1.26 billion) of
bonds won’t take place before market activity picks up in
September, according to a banker involved in the transaction,
who asked not to be named as details are private.  
 Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank AG and Ceska Sporitelna AS
were hired in February for the sale of foreign bonds, which was
delayed in April as borrowing costs surged on concern south
Europe’s debt crisis will spread. Three Czech political parties
that won May general elections said on June 30 they plan deeper
fiscal-deficit cuts next year than the country pledged in its
road map to euro adoption.  
 “Market activity is traditionally lower in holiday
months,” economist  Jan Vejmelek  at Komercni Banka AS in Prague
said today. Conditions are “not completely ideal” as investors
remain concerned about south Europe’s budget deficits, he said.
“In the autumn it may also be clearer what specific fiscal
measures the new government will take,” he said.  
 The Finance Ministry won’t confirm or deny that the sale
has been delayed until September, its spokesman, Jakub Haas,
said by phone. The ministry will sell the bonds in euros when
market conditions are favorable, he said.  
 The three parties agreed on a common political program and
will sign an accord to form a coalition today at 6 p.m. in
Prague, Prime Minister  Petr Necas  said on July 9.
