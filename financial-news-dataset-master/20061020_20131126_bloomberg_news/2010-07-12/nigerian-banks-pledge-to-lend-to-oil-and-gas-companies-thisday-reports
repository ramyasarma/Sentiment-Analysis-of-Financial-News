             Nigerian banks, which reduced
lending following a liquidity crisis in the industry last year,
pledged to provide long-term financing to local oil companies,
 ThisDay  reported today.  
 The loans will help the companies build capacity, the
Lagos-based newspaper reported, citing  Phillip Oduoza , managing
director-designate of  United Bank for Africa Plc , the country’s
fourth-biggest lender by market value.  
 Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, has set up funds to
finance operations in agriculture, power and textiles
production, and a similar fund should be established for the oil
and gas industry, the newspaper cited Oduoza as saying.
