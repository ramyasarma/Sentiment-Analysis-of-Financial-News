             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros in London rose to the highest level
in 10 months, data from the British Bankers’ Association showed.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.766 percent, the most since Sept. 3, 2009, the BBA said
today. The rate was 0.76 percent at the end of last week. The
euro Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ 
reluctance to lend, widened to 24.8 basis points as of 11:50
a.m. in London, from 20.5 basis points last week.  
 Three-month dollar Libor slipped to 0.526 percent, the BBA
said. The rate was 0.527 percent on July 9.  
 Three-month Euribor rose to 0.827 percent, the most since
Aug. 27, 2009, from 0.822 percent on July 9, according to data
from the European Banking Federation.
