             Some Australian unions are seeking a
7 percent rise in wages as labor agreements come up for
renegotiation at places such as Telstra Corp. and Airport Fuel
Services, the Australian Financial Review reported.  
 The Transport Workers Union is planning a strike over a
wage dispute at Airport Fuel Services, the newspaper said. The
Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union is also
considering industrial action if Telstra doesn’t agree to
discuss a new wage claim, it said.
