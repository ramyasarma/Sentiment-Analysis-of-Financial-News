             Czech June inflation was faster than
the central bank’s forecast by 0.3 percentage point because of
fuel prices, the Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said today in
a statement on its website.  
 Overall, domestic inflation pressures remain “subdued”
and the bank’s inflation forecast is not “in jeopardy,” it
said in the statement.
