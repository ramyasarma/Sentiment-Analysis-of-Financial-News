             Ashok Leyland Ltd. rose as much as
1.4 percent in Mumbai and traded at 70 rupees as of 9:02 a.m.
local time, poised for its highest close in more than two weeks.
The maker of buses and trucks was rated “buy” in new coverage
by Sandeep Pandya, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who
said increasing capacity and demand will drive volume growth and
returns. The analyst has a share-price estimate of 82 rupees.
