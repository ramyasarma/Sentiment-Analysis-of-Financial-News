             Raw sugar rose the most this month
on speculation that supplies from Brazil, the world’s biggest
grower, will be disrupted by congestion at export terminals.  
 Shipments may be delayed at least until August as a record
harvest creates an “unprecedented” bottleneck of ships waiting
to load at Brazil’s main port, according to Cosan SA Industria &
Comercio, the world’s largest sugar-cane processor. The nation
ships 54 percent of the world’s exports, up from 20 percent a
decade ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  
 “The tightness in the physical market will continue
because of the wait at the ports,” said  Ricardo Scaff , a trader
at Rabobank International in New York.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.49 cent, or 3
percent, to 17.1 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
marking the biggest gain for a most-active contract since June
30. The price has advanced 6.5 percent this month.  
 White-sugar futures for October delivery rose $3.20, or 0.6
percent, to $518.60 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London.  
 The number of vessels waiting to load at six Brazilian
sugar ports, including the biggest at  Santos , rose to 105 on
July 7 from 100 a week earlier, according to shipping agencies
 Santos Associados Consultoria Ltda . and Unimar Agenciamentos
Maritimos Ltda.
