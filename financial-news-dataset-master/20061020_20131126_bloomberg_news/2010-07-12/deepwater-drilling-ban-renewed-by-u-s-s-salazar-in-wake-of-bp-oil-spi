             U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken
Salazar directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
Regulation and Enforcement to issue new suspensions of deepwater
drilling on the outer continental shelf, according to an e-
mailed statement.  
 Salazar said a pause is needed to ensure that oil and gas
companies implement adequate safety measures to reduce the risks
associated with deepwater drilling operations and are prepared
for blowouts and oil spills.
