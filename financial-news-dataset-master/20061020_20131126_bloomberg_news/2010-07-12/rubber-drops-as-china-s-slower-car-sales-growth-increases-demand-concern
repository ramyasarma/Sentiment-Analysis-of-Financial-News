             Rubber declined for a second day
after data showed car sales growth in China slowed, raising
concern that demand may weaken from the largest consumer of the
commodity used to make tires.  
 Futures in Tokyo dropped as much as 2.9 percent to the
lowest level since July 6. The price also declined as crude oil
retreated from a one-week high, weakening the appeal of natural
rubber as an alternative to synthetic products.  
 Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles in China, the largest auto market, grew 19 percent from
a year earlier to 1.04 million last month, the  China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers  said July 9. It was the slowest pace
since March 2009 as dealers’ inventories increased after
 inflation  quickened in May to an annual 3.1 percent rate, the
fastest in 19 months, reducing buyers’ spending power.  
 “Concern about Chinese car sales put a drag on rubber
futures,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at Tokyo-based commodity
broker Fujitomi Co., said today by phone.  
 December-delivery rubber lost as much as 7.9 yen to 265.1
yen per kilogram ($2,983 a metric ton) before settling at 265.5
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  
 China’s passenger-car sales have risen every month since
February 2009 after the government halved the consumption tax on
small vehicles to 5 percent the preceding month as part of an
economic stimulus package. Vehicle demand surged 46 percent to
13.6 million last year, surpassing the  U.S.  for the first time.  
 Tax Increase  
 The small-car sales tax was raised to 7.5 percent this year,
and June was the third straight month of slowing demand. Monthly
sales may decline from year-earlier levels during the second
half of 2010, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts  Adrian Chan  and
 Hung Bin Toh  wrote in a report on May 26.  
 Losses in rubber futures were limited as Japan’s currency
weakened after the party of Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  lost
control of the Japanese parliament’s upper house, boosting the
appeal of yen-based contracts.  
 The yen traded at 88.87 per dollar at 4:18 p.m. in Tokyo
from 88.62 last week. Earlier it reached a two-week low of 89.16
as the election result may undermine the ruling party’s efforts
to cut the world’s largest  public debt .  
 In the cash market, Thai benchmark rubber price dropped 0.4
percent to 112.35 baht ($3.47) per kilogram today, according to
the  Rubber Institute of Thailand . Concerns over the global
economic recovery sparked selling, while prices should be
cushioned by limited supply, the group said.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 1.4 percent to settle at 21,805 yuan ($3,220) a ton.  
 China’s natural-rubber inventories rose 3,429 tons to
19,411 tons, the bourse said on July 9, based on a survey of 10
warehouses. It was the second weekly increase after reaching the
lowest level since January 2003.
