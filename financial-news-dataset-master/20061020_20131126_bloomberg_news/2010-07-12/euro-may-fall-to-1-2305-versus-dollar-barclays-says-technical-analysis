             The euro may fall as low as $1.2305
against the dollar this week should it fail to surpass key
“cloud resistance” on the daily ichimoku chart, according to
Barclays Capital Plc.  
 The euro hasn’t broken through the cloud resistance level
of $1.2785 set for the rest of July.  
 “Intraday a break below $1.2550 is likely to trigger more
stop loss selling and a return to the $1.2450/80 breakout level,
probably a retest of trendline support at $1.2305 later in the
week thereafter,” analysts including  Philip Roberts  in London
wrote in a note today. “A break below $1.2550 would strongly
suggest to us that the summer doldrums are underway.”  
 The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.2558 as of 11:22 a.m. in
London. It reached a near two-month high of $1.2698 on July 8.  
 An ichimoku chart analyzes the midpoints of historic highs
and lows. A cloud is the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart, and is used to show an area
where buy or sell orders may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy orders may be
grouped, and resistance is a level where sell orders may be
clustered.
