             More than half of U.K. consumers
predict the  economy  will worsen and two fifths say they will
spend less on eating out and big-ticket purchases such as
household electrical items, a survey by GfK NOP Ltd. showed.  
 Fifty-eight percent of respondents asked about the current
economic situation said things would get worse before they get
better, while 24 percent predicted improvement, the market
researcher said in a statement on its website yesterday. GfK NOP
questioned 1,000 adults online June 24-28.  
 The survey underlines the fragility of U.K. sentiment less
than a year after the economy shook off its worst recession on
record. Bank of England policy makers kept up their emergency
stimulus last week to help bolster the  recovery  as the
government enacts the deepest spending cuts in half a century.  
 “It is ironic that a reduction in consumer spending --
driven by economic uncertainty -- could in fact bring about the
thing people are most concerned about: a dip back into
recession,” Ivan Browne, consumer products and retail expert at
GfK NOP, said in a statement.  
 Questioned on their spending on particular items, 46
percent of respondents said they would spend less on new
furniture, and 45 percent said the same about electrical goods
such as televisions. Forty-two percent of consumers said they
would be spending less money going out drinking, and 39 percent
said they would cut back on eating out.
