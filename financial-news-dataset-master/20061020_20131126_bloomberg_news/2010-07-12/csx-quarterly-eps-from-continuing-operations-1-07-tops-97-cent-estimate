             CSX Corp. , the third-largest U.S.
railroad by 2009 revenue, reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’  estimates  as improved automobile sales led an
increase in rail traffic.  
 Net income  rose 36 percent to $414 million, or $1.07, from
$305 million, or 77 cents, a year earlier, Jacksonville,
Florida-based CSX said yesterday in a statement. The average
 estimate  of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was profit of 97
cents a share. Revenue gained 22 percent to $2.66 billion.  
 Second-quarter volumes climbed 13 percent from a year
earlier, led by a 63 percent gain in automotive shipments, CSX
said. The company, which has said it delivered about 30 percent
of the light vehicles in North America last year, had an 81
percent increase in revenue from the auto industry.  
 “While the economy remains dynamic, our markets overall
continue to improve, and our outlook remains positive,” Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Ward  said in the statement.  
 CSX said its metals shipments rose 44 percent and revenue
from the industry jumped 61 percent in the three months ended
June 25.  Revenue  from coal, the source of 30 percent of CSX’s
sales last year, rose 26 percent to $835 million on a 7 percent
gain in shipments.  
 CSX rose 14 cents to $52.60 at 5:56 p.m. yesterday after
the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares
gained 6.7 percent this year through July 9.  
 Union Pacific Corp.  is the biggest U.S. railroad, followed
by Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
