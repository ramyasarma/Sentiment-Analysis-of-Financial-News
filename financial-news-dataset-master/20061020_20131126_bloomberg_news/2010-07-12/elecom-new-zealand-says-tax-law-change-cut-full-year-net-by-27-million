             Telecom Corp. , New Zealand’s largest
phone company, said full-year profit fell more than previously
estimated after tax changes introduced in the May 20 budget
reduced earnings by about NZ$38 million ($27 million).  
 The increased tax provision meant net income in the year
ended June 30, excluding one-time gains or losses, was at the
lower end of a range of NZ$362 million to NZ$402 million, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement. That’s a fall of as
much as 25 percent from NZ$481 million in the previous year.  
 Telecom previously said earnings may drop to as low as
NZ$400 million because of slow domestic demand, falling prices
and the effects of an outage on the company’s new mobile network.
The stock slid 23 percent the past six months, the third-worst
performance on the benchmark NZX 50  index .  
 The government removed the ability for companies to claim
tax depreciation on buildings, resulting in increased provisions
for many publicly traded businesses. Finance Minister  Bill English  also announced a cut in the company tax rate to 28
percent from 30 percent beginning in 2012.  
 A second taxation law before parliament will be enacted
this year and will result in a one-time tax payment of NZ$20
million to NZ$30 million in the 12 months ending June 30, 2011,
Telecom said, without providing more details.  
 The company’s effective tax rate will be around 37 percent
in 2011, it said.
