             Colombia sold $500 million worth of
peso bonds due in 2021 in international markets, a week after
the country’s credit-rating outlook was raised to positive by
Standard & Poor’s on optimism President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos ’s plan to create a stabilization fund will boost growth.  
 The country sold the securities to yield 6.75 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of
America Corp. managed the sale, according to a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filing. Colombia initially sold about
$800 million worth of the 7.75 percent securities, known as
Global TES, on April 7.  
 S&P lifted the outlook on Colombia’s BB+ rating, or one
level below investment grade, on July 7, saying the fund will
increase the economy’s “resilience.” Santos is slated to take
office Aug. 7. The government is also taking advantage of
renewed demand for emerging-market assets that pushed yields on
the 2021 notes to the lowest level since they were issued.  
 “The government is taking a holistic strategy of first
announcing changes and then coming to the market with that
positive inertia,”  Vitali Meschoulam , an emerging-market
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a phone
interview from New York.

 The yield on the 2021 bonds fell to 6.60 percent last week,
tying a low reached June 24, according to Bogota-based brokerage
Correval SA. It climbed 10 basis points today to 6.70 percent,
leaving the yield down 75 points since April 12. A basis point
equals 0.01 percentage point.  
 With today’s Global TES sale, Colombia completes its plans
to sell an additional $500 million in overseas debt to replace
revenue from the scrapped sale of power company Isagen SA,
Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga  said July 2. The government
also said it will seek $500 million from multilateral lenders
and auction an additional 2 trillion pesos ($1.07 billion) of
local bonds.  
 The South American nation’s move to tap the international
market follows Mexico’s sale of 850 million euros ($1.07
billion) of seven-year bonds last week.  
 Colombia’s strong peso also boosted the attractiveness of
Global TES, according to Meschoulam.  
 The peso has jumped 8.8 percent this year, the best
performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
currency today fell 0.2 percent to 1,877.90 per U.S. dollar from
1,873.55 at the end of last week.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell eight basis points to 7.59 percent, according to
Colombia’s stock exchange. That’s its lowest level on a closing
basis since April 2006. The bond’s price climbed 0.615 centavo
to 123.341 centavos per peso.
