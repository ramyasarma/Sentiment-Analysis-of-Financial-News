             Hogs fell to a one-month low as
consumption of pork on signs of slowing demand from meatpackers.
Cattle gained.  
 Meatpacking plants last week slaughtered 1.72 million hogs,
down 13 percent from prior week and 12 percent from a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Demand for
pork and beef historically declines after the U.S. Independence
Day holiday on July 4.  
 “This is not the time of year when you can get excited
about demand for meat,” said  Dennis Smith , a senior account
executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “We’re
expecting a flat to lower cash market driving pork lower.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement fell 0.1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to 79.925 cents a pound at 10:45 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price slipped to 79.675 cents,
the lowest level since June 10. The price before today gained 22
percent this year as producers culled herds to reduce supply.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.2 cent to 91.6
cents a pound in Chicago. A higher close higher today would be
the fifth straight gain. Feeder-cattle futures for August
delivery dropped 0.15 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.1305 a pound.
