             Georgian Oil and Gas Corp. , the
former Soviet republic’s state-owned energy company, is
considering an initial public offering to attract investment,
the energy minister said.  
 “A minority stake should be offered, but this won’t happen
in the next two years,”  Alexander Khetaguri  said by telephone
today in the capital Tbilisi. No final decision on whether to
sell shares has been made, he said.  
 Mariam Valishvili , a deputy to Khetaguri, said earlier
today that the state was considering selling as much as 25
percent of the company to finance expansion, including gas
storage and a liquefied gas facility.  
 Georgian Oil and Gas Corp. was created in 2006 by combining
state shares in existing energy companies. It owns the Georgian
sections of the  North-South Main Gas Pipeline , which delivers
gas from Russia primarily to Armenia, and the Baku-Supsa oil
pipeline, which moves Azeri oil to a terminal on Georgia’s Black
Sea coast,  Tamar Shoshiashvili , a company spokeswoman, said.  
 In February, Georgia announced plans to build a plant to
liquefy as much as 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year
for export to Europe. Investors in Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine
expressed interest.
