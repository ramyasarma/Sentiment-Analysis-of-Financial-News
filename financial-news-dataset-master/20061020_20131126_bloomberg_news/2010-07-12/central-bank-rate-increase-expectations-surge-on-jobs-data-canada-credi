             Credit markets indicate investors
are becoming certain the Bank of Canada will raise interest
rates at a second consecutive meeting after the country posted
the largest quarterly gain in employment on record.  
 The benchmark two-year bond’s yield climbed 29 basis points
to 1.72 percent in the three trading sessions ended July 9, the
most since October, according to Bloomberg data. Rates on
overnight index swaps and bankers acceptances also rose as
investors increased bets on a rate increase July 20.  
 The jobs report “cements the view that the bank will raise
rates,”  Carlos Leitao , chief economist at Laurentian Bank
Securities in Montreal, said in a telephone interview. Leitao
said he expects three more 25-basis-point increases by year-end.  
 The yield gap between 10-year Canadian bonds over 2-year
securities decreased to 1.50 percentage points, the narrowest
level since October 2008. The so-called yield curve touched 2.32
percentage points on Jan. 11, the widest since January 2002.  
 Canada created 93,2000 jobs in June, almost five times more
than economists expected, capping a three-month period where
employment rose by 226,600, the greatest increase in employment
in records dating to 1976. The  jobless rate  fell to 7.9 percent,
the lowest since January 2009, from 8.1 percent. Canada is the
first country in the Group of Seven to recoup employment losses
from the global recession.  
 The  odds  of the Bank of Canada raising its interest rate to
0.75 percent at its July 20 meeting rose to 96 percent from 76
percent on June 8, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG
calculation derived from overnight index swaps. Yields on 1-
month overnight index swaps, which measure what investors think
the bank’s policy rate will average over the period, rose to
0.6645 percent after the report from 0.632 percent.  
 Maple Bonds  
 Elsewhere in credit markets,  National Australia Bank  Ltd.
sold C$400 million ($387 million) of Canadian-dollar denominated
bonds on July 9. The 4.19 percent so-called “Maple” bonds,
which mature in July 2015, were sold to yield 168.5 basis points
over a comparable government bond.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own Canadian company
debt rather than federal government debt remained at 147 basis
points, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The
yield gap, or spread, had been as narrow as 114 basis points on
March 19. Overall yields rose to 4.09 percent from 4.03 percent.  
 The Bank of Canada will publish its quarterly survey of
senior loan officers and business executives at 10:30 a.m. New
York Time. The surveys may give an indication about the
availability of credit for companies and their optimism about
future sales.  
 Sparked a Reaction  
 The jobs report also sparked gains in bankers acceptances
futures. Yields on the September 2010 bankers’ acceptances
 contract  rose to 1.12 percent on July 9 from 1.045 percent the
previous day. So-called Bax contracts have settled an average of
about 20 basis points above the central bank’s overnight target
since 1992, Bloomberg data show.  
 Economic data earlier last week, including weaker-than-
expected readings on  building permits  and the Ivey  purchasing
managers index , helped push the two-year bond yield to as low as
1.56 percent.  
 “There was undue pessimism priced in” the bond market
about the recovery,  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian fixed-income
and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s
largest lender, said by phone from Toronto. “You still have to
get to the low end of normal on rates. Pressure on the front
end, a flattening curve, are all part of the process going
forward for Canada.”
