             Investors should end a bet against
the Treasury 30-year security and prepare to purchase the long
bond after the government sells $13 billion of the debt in two
days, according to  UBS AG .  
 “We think consistently a good trade is to be long the day
after the auction,”  Mike Schumacher , head of global rates
strategy in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone
interview. A long position is a bet a security will gain. UBS
strategists led by Schumacher recommended in a note to clients
today that investors hold the position for one day, targeting a
three basis-point gain.  
 The bank, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade with the
Federal Reserve and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions,
recommended in a note on July 9 that investors sell 30-year
bonds and close the position today because “the rally over the
past month does not bode well for bonds post-auction.”  
 The bond yielded 4.05 percent today, compared with 4.01
percent when the short-recommendation was issued, the
strategists wrote. It touched 4.25 percent on June 15.  
 The security to be sold on July 14 yielded 4.047 percent in
pre-auction trading today.  
 The government is auctioning $69 billion in notes and bonds
this week. It sold $35 billion today in three-year securities at
a yield of 1.055 percent, the lowest ever, and will offer $21
billion of 10-year debt tomorrow.
