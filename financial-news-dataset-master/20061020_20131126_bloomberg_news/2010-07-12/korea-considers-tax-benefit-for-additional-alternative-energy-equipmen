             South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest
crude oil importer, is considering expanding the list of
alternative-energy equipment eligible for a tax benefit to cut
reliance on fossil fuels.  
 The government will prepare details by September to submit
the plan to parliament, the finance ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 South Korea said in November it will cut emissions by 30
percent by 2020 under a “business as usual” scenario. The
target corresponds to a 4 percent reduction from 2005 levels,
according to Green Korea United, a non-profit group. Asia’s
fourth-largest economy will spend about 2 percent of its gross
domestic product annually by 2013 to reduce carbon emissions and
diversify its exports.  
 The government is also considering reducing import tax on
raw materials used in rechargeable batteries and equipment to
produce renewable energy, including solar and wind power,
according to the statement.
