             Patrick Birley , chief executive
officer of the European Climate Exchange in London, will leave
the group after the takeover of its holding company by
 Intercontinental Exchange Inc.   
 Birley will leave within three months after a transition
period and handover to ICE executives, he said July 9 by phone.
“This is part of the transaction,” he said, declining to say
what he planned to do next.  
 ICE completed its purchase of Climate Exchange Plc, which
owns ECX -- the world’s biggest carbon market -- for about 395
million pounds ($592 million) on July 8.
