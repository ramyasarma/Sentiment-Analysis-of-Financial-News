             OAO TMK , Russia’s biggest producer
of steel pipes, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization were probably higher in the second quarter than
in the previous three months as demand rose.  
 “As a result of the strong market environment observed in
the second quarter of 2010, the company expects Ebitda to
slightly increase as compared to the first quarter,” TMK said
today in a statement. “Global demand for TMK pipe products
continued to improve.”  
 The company’s U.S. unit,  TMK IPSCO , ran at more than 80
percent of capacity in the second quarter on demand from shale-
gas producers, Moscow-based TMK said in the statement.
Production at the U.S. division rose 20 percent quarter-on-
quarter, the company said, without specifying output.  
 TMK’s total production was little changed at 931,000 metric
tons, compared with 933,000 tons in the first quarter, the
company said. The pipemaker plans to announce second-quarter
earnings in October, according to its  website .
