             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose on speculation earnings will improve after Alcoa
Inc. in the U.S. reported profit that exceeded estimates.  
 American depositary receipts of Komatsu Ltd., a Japanese
maker of earthmoving machinery, climbed 1.2 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo after Alcoa, the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ projections. Those of Advantest Corp., the world’s
biggest maker of memory-chip testers that gets almost 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, gained 1.3 percent. ADRs of BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, fell 2
percent after commodity prices dropped.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,580 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,530 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,600 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  gained 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX 50
Index  increased 0.1 percent in Wellington.  
 “The strength of corporate earnings was confirmed, which
eased concerns the U.S. economic recovery will stall,” said
 Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist in Tokyo at
Tachibana Securities Co. Declines in commodity prices represent
“a weak flow of funds to risk assets.”  
 In New York, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.1
percent to 1,078.75 yesterday as analyst upgrades of technology
companies such as SanDisk Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. boosted
optimism before the start of the earnings season. September
futures of stocks on the gauge gained 0.2 percent.  
 Alcoa Profit  
 Alcoa said after the market closed yesterday earnings for
the second quarter from continuing operations were 13 cents a
share, exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, as higher metal prices boosted sales.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has retreated 3.6 percent in
2010, compared with drops of 3.3 percent by the  S&P 500  and 1.1
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.2 times for the S&P and 11.6 times for the Stoxx.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index, a  measure  of six metals
including copper and zinc, declined 1.9 percent yesterday, the
most since July 1. Crude oil dropped for the first time in four
days, losing $1.14 to settle at $74.95 a barrel in New York.
