             UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive
Officer  Alessandro Profumo  called on banks to start their own 20
billion-euro ($25.1 billion) fund to support ailing lenders.  
 The pool would receive voluntary contributions from the 20
biggest cross-border European banks and would provide guarantees
to failing lenders to sell secured notes, said a spokeswoman for
UniCredit, confirming comments Profumo wrote in the Financial
Times earlier today.  
 Profumo’s plan aims to avoid any financial contribution
from European Union authorities in the next crisis, after
taxpayers were forced to bail out lenders in the credit crisis.
EU finance ministers, meeting in Brussels today to discuss the
stress tests on banks, are yet to spell out how they will deal
with a lender that fails the tests and whether any additional
capital will be provided by governments or the EU.  
 “This is a good alternative to governments levies,” said
 Mario Spreafico , chief investment officer at Schroder Private
Banking in Italy, who manages about 1.5 billion euros. “A
private sector fund would avoid governments having to spend
money to rescue banks in case of a new wave of crisis.”  
 Profumo has already promoted his proposal to Deutsche Bank
AG and Banco Santander SA, the FT reported.  
 “The fund would raise very significant moral hazard
issues,” said  Angelo Manca , a money manager at Ockham Capital
Partners Ltd. in London. “Banks should manage their liquidity
risk by running a more balanced asset liability management
strategy, rather than counting on funds, either private or
public.”
