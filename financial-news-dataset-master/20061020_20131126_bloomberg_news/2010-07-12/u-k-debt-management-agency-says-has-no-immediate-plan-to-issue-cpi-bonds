             The U.K. has no immediate plans to
issue  inflation-protected bonds  linked to consumer prices, the
Debt Management Office said.  
 The agency has not changed its policy, and will have a full
consultation with the market if it plans to sell such securities
in the future, spokesman  Steve Whiting  said in a telephone
interview from London today. Inflation-protected bonds issued by
the U.K. government are currently linked to the retail-price
index.  
 The U.K. government will align all future increases in
occupational pensions with the consumer-price index rather than
retail-price index, Pensions Minister Steve Webb said on July 8.
