             Volkswagen AG , the biggest foreign
carmaker in China, boosted sales in the nation 46 percent in the
first half after introducing new models to attract consumers in
the world’s largest vehicle market.  
 The automaker’s sales to consumers rose to 950,278 vehicles
in the greater China area, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. Deliveries of Audi luxury-brand sedans rose 64 percent to
109,887.  
 “We are practically sold out of many of our models,” said
 Winfried Vahland , president and chief executive officer of
Volkswagen China.  
 Volkswagen plans to invest 4.4 billion euros ($5.5 billion)
to expand production capacity and introduce new models in the
country, Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said in
April. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker sold 1.4 million
vehicles in China last year and aims to boost annual sales to
more than 2 million in the “medium-term,” Winterkorn said
then.  
 Volkswagen, which counts China as its biggest market, added
models including the Tiguan sport-utility vehicle, the Audi Q5
and an upgraded Jetta this year. The company will start sales of
the CC four-door sports coupe on July 15 in Shanghai, the
company said in today’s statement.  
 General Motors Co., VW’s biggest overseas rival in China,
increased deliveries 49 percent to 1.21 million vehicles in the
first six months.
