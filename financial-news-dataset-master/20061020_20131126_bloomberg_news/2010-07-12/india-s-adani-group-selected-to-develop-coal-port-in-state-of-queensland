             Adani Group , India’s biggest coal
importer, was picked to develop an export facility for the fuel
in Australia, a spokeswoman said.  
 Adani and DBCT Management, which leases the Dalrymple Bay
Coal Terminal, will separately draw up plans for export
terminals at Dudgeon Point, Mary Steele, a spokeswoman for North
Queensland Bulk Ports Corp., said by phone from Brisbane today,
without giving the capacity.  
 “North Queensland Bulk Ports held this land for
development since 2000,”  Brad Fish , chief executive officer of
the state company, said in a statement on its website. “Its
close proximity to the two coal terminals at Hay Point will
support the increasing demand for coal from new and existing
industry.”  
 The International Monetary Fund revised India’s 2010
economic growth forecast to 9.4 percent from its earlier
prediction of 8.8 percent in April. The nation’s thermal coal
imports may climb to 72 million metric tons in 2011, according
to Tata Power Co., which is setting up the country’s first large
coal-fired power facility.  
 Dudgeon Point is located about 15 kilometers (9.4 miles)
south of Mackay on the Queensland Coast and lies within the Port
of Hay Point about four kilometers north of the existing coal
terminals, according to a statement on North Queensland Bulk
Ports website.  
 Devendra Amin , vice president of Adani, wasn’t immediately
available for comment.
