             Peru’s sol was unchanged at a 23-
month high after increased overseas demand for the currency
offset a decline in copper, the nation’s top export.  
 The sol traded at 2.8235 per U.S. dollar at 3:53 p.m. New
York time.  
 Demand for the local currency is rising as foreign
investors buy sol-denominated bonds amid a faster-than-expected
rebound in the Peruvian economy. The yield on Peru’s benchmark
8.6 percent August 2017 bond last week fell the most in a year,
as foreign investors bet the sol won’t weaken and interest rates
won’t rise as quickly as local investors expect since inflation
remains under control.  
 “There’s a big appetite for soles right now because of
interest in local assets,” said  Gonzalo Navarro , head trader at
Banco Santander in Lima. “The sol is divorced from the other
markets.”  
 Peru’s economy may expand 6 percent this year, and gross
domestic product may have risen at a “double-digit” rate in
the second quarter, Finance Minister  Mercedes Araoz  told
reporters today in Lima.  
 The central bank didn’t  intervene  in the foreign exchange
market today, it said on its website. The bank has bought
dollars in 13 of the last 15 trading sessions to ease gains in
the sol.  
 The yield on the benchmark bond fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, today to 5.54 percent, after dropping 24
basis points last week.
