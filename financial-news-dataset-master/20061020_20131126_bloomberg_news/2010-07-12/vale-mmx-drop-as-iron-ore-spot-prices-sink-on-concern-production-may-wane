             Vale SA  dropped the most in more
than a week in Sao Paulo trading as spot prices for iron ore
delivered to China sank to its lowest level this year on concern
steel production is waning.  
 The world’s biggest producer of one of the main ingredient
for making steel fell 1.4 percent to 38.47 reais at 12:10 p.m.
New York time.  MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA , the iron ore
company controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, sank 2 percent
to 10.78 reais, the biggest drop in a week.  
 “It’s very relevant worry that Chinese housing and
infrastructure development may slow and would affect demand for
steel, meaning ore as well,”  Bernardo Lobao , a fund manager for
Studio Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro.  
 The cost of 62 percent iron ore delivered to the port of
Tianjin dropped for a 15th consecutive day, declining 3 percent
to $118.10 a metric ton, according to The Steel Index. That’s
the lowest since Dec. 29.  
 Chinese iron ore buyers have been absent from the spot
market for almost a month and are shunning purchases amid
speculation of lower prices, Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty analysts
said in a report dated July 9. The steel market, the biggest
iron ore user, has weakened, Liu Guosheng, vice chairman of
China’s Baosteel Group Corp., said in Shanghai last week.  
 Vale fell 8.9 percent this year, while MMX rose 7.7
percent. The Bovespa stock index dropped 8 percent in 2010.  
 Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA , Brazil’s third-biggest
steelmaker that also produces ore, dropped 1 percent to 27.56
reais.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA , Brazil’s second-
biggest steelmaker that also mines ore, sank 1.2 percent to
52.31 reais.
