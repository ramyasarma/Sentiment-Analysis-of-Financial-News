             Yields on 10-year  top-rated 
municipal bonds may decline further after falling to the lowest
level since 2001, according to  Matt Fabian , managing director of
Municipal Market Advisors.  
 Tax-exempt general obligations slipped 1 basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, today to an average yield of 2.93
percent, the lowest in at least nine-and-a-half years, as
investors boosted holdings with reinvested June and July coupon
payments. States and municipalities are scheduled to sell $6.8
billion in debt this week, 11 percent below the weekly average
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “If people become comfortable below 3 percent, munis will
have more of a rally potential,” Fabian said in an interview.
“This could cause more trading accounts to want to come in and
trade munis because there’s an identified upside. This could be
the sign of a turning point in the market.”  
 Yields on the 10-year bonds haven’t risen since June 15,
according to data from MMA, an independent research firm in
Concord, Massachusetts, whose index has tracked tax-exempt debt
since January 2001.  
 Even so, the record yield is “significant because, at a
very low interest rate, there are points at which more investors
stop buying,” said  Austin Tobin , an analyst at Delphis Hanover
Corp., a municipal-market research firm based in Southbury,
Connecticut.  
 Coupon Payment  
 The combination of coupon-payment reinvestment and a dearth
of top-rated securities has narrowed the  spread  of 10-year tax-
exempts above two-year maturities to 224 basis points, its
lowest this year, Bloomberg data show.  
 Any further decline in yields would probably be limited,
Fabian said, without specifying a target. Bond yields move
inversely to their prices.  
 Ten-year municipal bonds yielded 97 percent of Treasuries
on July 9, down from a 13-month high ratio of 104 percent on
June 30, according to MMA data.  
 The  Bond Buyer 20 weekly index , a measure of 20-year tax-
exempt yields that dates to 1961, has been about 4.4 percent for
the past five weeks, up from a record low of 3.94 percent on
Oct. 1, 2009. The index has an average credit rating of Aa2,
Moody’s Investors Service third-highest investment grade.
