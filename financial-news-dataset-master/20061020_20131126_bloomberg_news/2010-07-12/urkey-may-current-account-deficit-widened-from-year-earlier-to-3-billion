             Turkey’s  current-account  deficit
widened in May from a year earlier, the seventh consecutive
month it has expanded, the central bank said.  
 The shortfall was $3 billion in the month, compared with
$1.6 billion in May last year, the central bank in Ankara said
on its website today. It was expected at $3.1 billion, according
to the median  estimate  of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Turkey’s  economy  grew an annual 11.7 percent in the first
quarter as domestic consumption helped recoup the bulk of the
output lost in last year’s recession. The current-account
deficit reflects the country’s need for external investment to
finance growth, and is a “weakness” that policy makers are
tracking, central bank Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  said on July 8.  
 The widening is part of a “trend deterioration evident
since late in 2009,”  Timothy Ash , head of emerging market
research at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in London, said in an e-
mailed report today. He forecast a gap equal to 4 percent of
gross domestic product this year.  
 The cumulative deficit in the 12 months through May widened
to $26.2 billion, or about 4 percent of 2009 GDP. In the first
five months Turkey drew $2.6 billion in direct investment from
abroad, down from $3.9 billion in the same period of 2009.
