             Spain’s win over the Netherlands in
the World Cup final was the most watched men’s soccer match in
U.S. history, according to Walt Disney Co.’s  ESPN network .  
 Yesterday’s game, which was televised by Disney’s ABC
network, drew 15.5 million viewers in the U.S., ESPN said in an
e-mailed statement.  Andres Iniesta  scored the only goal in the
final four minutes of extra time to give Spain a 1-0 victory and
its first World Cup title.  
 The U.S.’s 2-1 loss to Ghana in the round of 16 on June 26
had been the most watched men’s soccer game, drawing 14.9
million viewers on ABC.  
 “It was evident from the overwhelmingly positive reaction
just how much fans were drawn to the spectacle of this global
sports event,” ESPN Executive Vice President of Content  John Skipper  said in a statement. “We’re already looking ahead with
great anticipation to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.”  
 Only the 1999 women’s World Cup final between the U.S. and
China drew a bigger American television audience than
yesterday’s men’s title match, with 17.975 million viewers.
