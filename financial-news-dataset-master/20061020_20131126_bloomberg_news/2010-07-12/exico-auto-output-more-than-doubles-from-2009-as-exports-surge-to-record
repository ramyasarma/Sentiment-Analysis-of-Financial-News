             Mexican  production  of cars and light
trucks more than doubled in June from the same month a year
earlier as the country exported a record number of vehicles, the
nation’s  Automobile Industry Association  said.  
 Output  increased 102 percent to 206,195 units last month,
the group said today in a statement distributed in Mexico City.
That’s the third highest monthly total in Mexico’s history,
trailing the months of August 2007 and October 2008, according
to Eduardo Solis, the head of the association.  
 Automakers increased production in response to higher
external demand, even as Mexico’s domestic auto sales were just
59,909 in June, below the 2008 average of more than 85,000 a
month, the group said in the report.  Exports  rose 109 percent to
177,575 cars and light trucks, a record one-month total.  
 “We’re winning in our principal markets,” Solis said.  
 Mexico shipped 67 percent of its vehicle exports to the
U.S. in June. Europe was the second-biggest market, buying 8.9
percent of the autos shipped abroad in the period. Latin America
was third.  
 Accumulated production totaled 1,077,651 through June this
year, up 79 percent from the same period in 2009. Total exports
in 2010 through the first half reached 887,872, an 83 percent
increase from the year earlier period.  
 The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 12.8310 per dollar at 3:39
p.m. New York time from 12.7693 on July 9.
