             Fitch Ratings raised Argentina’s
long-term foreign currency issuer rating out of default, citing
the nation’s second defaulted debt swap offer that closed last
month.  
 Argentina defaulted on about $95 billion in debt in
December 2001. Fitch upgraded Argentina’s long-term foreign
currency rating from RD to B with a stable outlook.  
 “As a result of this last transaction, and the one in
2005, Argentina has completed the restructuring of over 90
percent of the 2001 defaulted bonds,” Fitch said in an e-mailed
statement today from New York. “This represents a positive step
toward normalizing relations with creditors.”  
 Argentina’s rating is supported by factors including eight
years of current account surpluses, the country’s relatively
high per capita income levels and strong economic growth in
recent years, Fitch said. The rating is constricted by
“volatile macroeconomic performance, a weak policy framework,
as well as still high government debt ratios relative to
sovereigns rated in the ‘B’ category,” the ratings agency said.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 11.7
percent at 12:15 p.m. New York time, according to pricing from
Deutsche Bank AG. The price was unchanged at 84 cents on the
dollar.
