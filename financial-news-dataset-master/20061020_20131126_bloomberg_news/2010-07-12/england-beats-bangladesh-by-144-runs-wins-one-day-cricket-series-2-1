             England beat Bangladesh by 144 runs
in today’s third and final one-day cricket international at
Edgbaston to win the series 2-1, helped by a record run-haul
from Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott.  
 After Craig Kieswetter’s dismissal left England on 1-1, the
pair put on 250 for the second wicket, England’s highest one-day
international partnership, before Trott was out for 110. Captain
Strauss went on to total 154 as England made 347-7 in its
allotted 50 overs. Ravi Bopara was not out 45.  
 In reply, the visitors -- who’d won the toss and chosen to
field -- were all out for 203 in 45 overs. Bopara took 4-38.  
 Two days ago Bangladesh won by five runs for its first-ever
win against England.  
 England left out James Anderson and the injured Ian Bell
today, and included Bopara and Tim Bresnan. The Bangladesh
lineup was unchanged.
