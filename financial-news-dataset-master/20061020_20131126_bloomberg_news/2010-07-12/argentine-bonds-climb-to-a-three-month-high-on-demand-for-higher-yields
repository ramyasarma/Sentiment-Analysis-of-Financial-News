             Argentine benchmark dollar bonds
rose to their highest price in more than three months as
investors sought the nation’s higher-yielding securities.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 slid 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 11.59
percent at 10:17 a.m. New York time, according to pricing from
Deutsche Bank AG. The price rose 0.35 cent to 84.35 cents on the
dollar, the highest level since March 29.  
 “Investors are looking for higher yields,” said  Mariana de Mendiburu , a portfolio manager at brokerage Solfin SA in
Buenos Aires. “There is risk appetite that is looking mid-
curve” at the 2015 notes, she said. “That’s the most liquid
bond.”  
 Argentina’s peso was little changed at 3.9370 per dollar
from 3.9355 on July 8. Argentine markets were closed for a
national holiday on July 9.
