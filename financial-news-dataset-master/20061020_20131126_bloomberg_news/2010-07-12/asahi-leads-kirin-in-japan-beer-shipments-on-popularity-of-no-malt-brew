             Asahi Breweries Ltd.  led  Kirin
Holdings Co.  in Japan’s beer market for the first time in two
years, as the company won more customers with its no-malt brew.  
 Asahi had a 37.1 percent share of first-half shipments for
standard, low-malt and no-malt beer, and Kirin had a 36.4
percent share, the Tokyo-based brewers said in statements today.
Industrywide volumes  fell  4.5 percent to 207.5 million cases,
the lowest since the companies began tracking data in 1992.  
 The no-malt brew, which attracts a lower tax rate than
regular beer, made up more than 30 percent of the total
shipments for the first time in Japan, as consumers opt for
cheaper drinks amid  falling wages . Asahi began selling the Clear
Asahi to restaurants and added the Strong Off brand, which
helped boost shipments of the category by 26 percent, spokesman
 Takayuki Tanaka  said by telephone.  
 Sales of the Super Dry standard beer were also better than
the company planned, Tanaka said.  
 Suntory Holdings Ltd. ’s share was 13.4 percent, and  Sapporo
Holdings Ltd. ’s was at 12.3 percent, the companies said in
separate statements.  
 A case of beer in Japan is equivalent to 12.66 liters (3.34
gallons).
