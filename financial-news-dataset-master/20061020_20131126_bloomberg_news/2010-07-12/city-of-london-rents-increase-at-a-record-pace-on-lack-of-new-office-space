             Rents for the best offices in
London’s main financial district climbed by almost a quarter in
the first half, the strongest six months of growth on record,
due to a shortage of new buildings,  NB Real Estate  said.  
 Average rents for prime City of London offices rose 11.6
percent to 53 pounds ($80) a square foot in the second quarter
from the previous three months, the London-based real estate
adviser said in a statement. That followed an 11.8 percent gain
in the previous quarter. They are still down about a quarter
from their 2007 peak.  
 City of London rents are increasing as companies compete
for quality space. Most projects were shelved during the
recession as rents declined and only two prime buildings are
coming onto the market next year.  
 “The shortage of new space will become more acute over the
next few years,” James Gillett, director of City offices, said
in the statement. “Tenants are now locked in bidding wars.”  
 Office rents in Canary Wharf, the capital’s other financial
district, have increased by a third since the start of this year
to 40 pounds per square foot, said the statement.  
 Reliable records for City rental data began in 1988,
according to the statement.
