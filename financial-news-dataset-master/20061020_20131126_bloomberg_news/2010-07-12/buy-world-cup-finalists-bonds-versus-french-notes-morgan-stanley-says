             Investors should buy Spanish and
Dutch three-year government bonds against equivalent-maturity
French securities, according to Morgan Stanley.  
 “Successful Spanish supply has removed short-term funding
concerns,”  Laurence Mutkin , a managing director at Morgan
Stanley in London, wrote in a research report dated July 9. “We
also see upside risk to Spain from the bank stress tests. Our
tactical model flags Holland as an attractive long due to better
momentum, risk-adjusted carry and business cycle. We also find
the commitment to fiscal austerity attractive.  
 ‘‘By contrast France has a poor record on fiscal reform,’’
Mutkin said. ‘‘Similarities between our recommendations and
recent World Cup performance are coincidental.’’  
 Investors should buy Dutch bonds maturing in January 2013
and Spanish notes due April 2013, and sell French securities
coming due January 2013, Mutkin said.
