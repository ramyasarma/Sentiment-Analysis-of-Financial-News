             India’s Minister of Finance Pranab
Mukherjee is likely to clarify in parliament that a new law on
hybrid financial products will clearly state which financial
product comes under the ambit of which regulator, the Financial
Express reported, citing people it didn’t identify. The rule
won’t dilute the autonomy of the Reserve Bank of India, the
newspaper said.
