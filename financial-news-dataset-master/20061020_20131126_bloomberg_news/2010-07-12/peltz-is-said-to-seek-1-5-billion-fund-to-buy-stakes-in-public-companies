             Billionaire  Nelson Peltz  is seeking
to raise $1.5 billion for a fund aimed at buying minority stakes
in public companies, according to two people with direct
knowledge of his plans.  
 Peltz, who oversees New York-based hedge-fund firm Trian
Fund Management LP, is marketing the investment pool as a
private-equity fund because client money will be locked up for
longer than with most  hedge funds , said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information is private. The fund
will seek representation on the boards of companies in which it
invests, said one of the people.  
 Peltz, 68, is the largest investor in fast-food chain
Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc. and is known for buying stakes in
companies and then pushing them to increase their value by
cutting costs or merging. He is venturing into private equity at
a time when fundraising is at an eight-year low and firms
struggle to revive leveraged buyouts amid stricter lending
conditions.  
 “Due to the lack of debt financing, private-equity
investors will direct money increasingly towards listed
companies, with the aim to exert influence over the companies’
strategy,” said Jeremie Le Febvre, partner at Paris-based
Triago, which advises funds seeking to solicit investors. “The
frontiers between private and public equity are blurring.”  
 Trian on Jan. 8 filed with Delaware state to incorporate
the fund, called Trian Partners Strategic Investment Fund LP
along with the general partnership that would run it, one of the
people said. The fund has yet to file a private-placement notice
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 The fund has already secured $433 million in commitments,
according to one of the people. It is targeting sovereign wealth
and pension funds, family offices and funds of funds.  
 Carrie Bloom, a spokeswoman for Trian, said she had no
immediate comment.
