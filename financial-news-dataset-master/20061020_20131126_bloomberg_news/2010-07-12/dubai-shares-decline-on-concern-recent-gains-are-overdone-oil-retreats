             Saudi Arabia shares retreated for
the first time in three days on concern recent gains are
overdone given growth prospects in the region and as companies
posted declines in second-quarter profit.  
 The  Tadawul All Share Index  lost 0.4 percent to 6,215.67 at
1:06 p.m. in Riyadh. The index has advanced 2 percent this
month.  Saudi British Bank  slid after reporting a 34 percent drop
in second-quarter profit and  Saudi Industrial Exports Co. , the
company that exports and imports products including fertilizers
and chemicals, decreased 3.8 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index  declined 0.04 percent to 53.47.  
 “We’re seeing a bit of a pullback” on a lack of positive
local catalysts, said Haissam Arabi, chief executive officer of
Gulfmena Alternative Investments in Dubai. Gulf shares are
“still reacting to the direction of global markets.”  
 Crude for August delivery dropped as much as 81 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $75.28 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Saudi Arabia holds a fifth of the
world’s proven oil reserves.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  declined 0.1 percent as Japan’s
ruling party lost its parliamentary majority, increasing
political uncertainty. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  retreated 0.6 percent as investors awaited the start of
the second-quarter earnings season.  
 Kuwait  
 Saudi British retreated 3.2 percent, the most since July
3, to 42.3 riyals. The bank 40 percent owned by HSBC Holdings
Plc said net income fell to 447 million riyals ($119.2 million)
from 676 million riyals year earlier. Saudi Industrial retreated
to 25.1 riyals, the lowest intraday level since June 21. The
company said its second-quarter loss widened to 2.9 million
riyals from 395,000 riyals a year earlier.  
 The  Kuwait SE Price Index  rose 1 percent to 6,496.5, the
highest this month. “The gain in Kuwait can be explained by
reports that the government will inject liquidity into the
market if needed,” Arabi said.  
 Kuwait’s government is willing to shore up the bourse
through investments by the country’s sovereign fund, Al-Watan
newspaper reported today, citing Commerce and Industry Minister
Ahmed al-Haroun. The newspaper did not give further details on
the envisaged intervention by the Kuwait Investment Authority.  
 The  DFM General Index  lost 0.2 percent, Oman’s  MSM 30 Index 
fell 0.6 percent and Abu Dhabi’s  gauge  was little changed at
2,527.33. The  QE Index  in Qatar increased 0.3 percent and
Bahrain’s  gauge  rose 1.5 percent, the most in three months.
