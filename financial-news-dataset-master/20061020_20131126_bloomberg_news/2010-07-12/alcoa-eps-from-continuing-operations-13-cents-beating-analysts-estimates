             Alcoa Inc. , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ projections as higher metal prices boosted sales.  
 Earnings from continuing operations were 13 cents a share,
exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Net income  of $136 million, or 13 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $454 million, or 47 cents, a year
earlier, New York-based Alcoa said today in a statement. Sales
rose 22 percent to $5.19 billion.  
 Aluminum for delivery in three months increased 39 percent,
on average, in the second quarter from a year earlier on the
London Metal Exchange. The price today was still down more than
40 percent from the July 2008 high, before the global economic
recession cut demand for the metal used in everything from jet
planes to beer cans. After prices fell and  global inventories 
rose, Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  idled 20 percent
of Alcoa’s aluminum-smelting capacity.  
 “We like the significant amount of costs that management
has cut from the business and we like the investments that
management is making in low-cost production,”  Anthony Rizzuto ,
managing director of Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York, wrote in a
July 7 report. “We remain concerned that the sluggish economic
recovery will cap the upside in aluminum prices over the near-
term.”  
 During the second quarter, the union representing 6,000
workers at 11 of Alcoa’s U.S. plants agreed to avoid a strike
and accept a labor contract under which employees share a
greater portion of health-care costs.  
 Alcoa, the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to report earnings for the three months through June,
 fell  7 cents to $10.87 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  The shares  have dropped 33 percent this year,
the  largest decline  in the 30-member Dow.
