             South Africa’s flexible exchange
rate provides a “buffer against shocks” and helps to reduce
“volatility” in interest rates, Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan said.  
 The central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent inflation target
gives investors “confidence in times of crisis,” Gordhan said
in a written reply to a question from a lawmaker in Cape Town.
South African banks are “strongly capitalized” and have
weathered the global financial crisis better than many in
developed countries, Gordhan added.
