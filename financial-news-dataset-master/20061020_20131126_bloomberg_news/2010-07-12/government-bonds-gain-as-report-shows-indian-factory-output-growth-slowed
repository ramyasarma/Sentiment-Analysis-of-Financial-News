             India’s 10-year bonds gained,
lowering yields from a two-week high, after a government report
showed growth in factory output slowed in May. The yield on the
7.8 percent note due May 2020 declined four basis points to 7.61
percent as of 11:10 a.m.in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The price rose 0.23, or 23 paise per 100
rupee face amount, to 101.25.
