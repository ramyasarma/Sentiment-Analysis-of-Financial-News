             Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA ’s
growth strategy is threatened by the BP Plc oil spill in the
U.S. that will lead small and mid-sized companies to abandon
deep-water exploration and production, La Tribune reported,
citing the chief executive of the French oil exporter.  
 Smaller companies will be unable to handle the financial
risks of an oil spill, and that narrowing of the field of deep-
water exploration companies will weaken the negotiating power of
countries as they face an increasingly smaller pool of
suppliers, CEO  Jean-Francois Henin  was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.  
 Most banks have exited the industry, leaving only a few
French lenders, the newspaper cited Henin as saying.
