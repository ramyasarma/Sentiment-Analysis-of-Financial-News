             Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, led by commodity producers, on a drop in
China’s copper imports and speculation that stress tests of
European banks will heighten growth concerns on the continent.  
 Pengrowth Energy Trust, which owns oil and gas properties
in Canada, lost 6.5 percent after announcing an acquisition it
valued at C$366 million ($353 million). Teck Resources Ltd.,
Canada’s largest base-metals and coal producer, slid 3.3 percent
as copper retreated for the first time in six days. Cameco Inc.,
the world’s second-largest uranium producer, rose 4.9 percent as
demand from China signaled a potential rebound in prices.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 4.69
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,565.76.  
 “With the European situation and China cooling off a bit,
there’s more nervousness about economic growth, and therefore
commodities have corrected,” said  Sebastian van Berkom , who
helps manage C$1.1 billion as a money manager at Van Berkom &
Associates in Montreal.  
 The S&P/TSX gained 3.3 percent  last week , the most since
October, after tumbling 4.4 percent the week before. Canadian
shares gained as the country reported job growth five times the
median economist estimate and France’s Total SA agreed to buy
oil sands developer UTS Energy Corp.  
 Copper declined 1.5 percent in New York after a report that
shipments of copper and products into China declined 17 percent
in June from a month earlier. Teck fell for the first time in
five days, dropping 3.3 percent to C$34.43. Consolidated
Thompson Iron Mines Ltd. lost 4.3 percent to C$7.50 as Chinese
imports of iron ore also decreased.  
 Arbitration  
 Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is developing the Oyu Tolgoi
copper mine in Mongolia with Rio Tinto Group, rose 2.8 percent
to C$14.93 after Rio Tinto referred to arbitration Ivanhoe
Mines’ adoption of a shareholder rights plan. Ivanhoe Mines
denies Rio Tinto’s claim that the plan violates a 2006 private
placement agreement between the companies.  
 Crude oil futures sank 1.5 percent as the U.S. dollar
gained the most in nine days. The American currency increased
against the euro amid uncertainty over the stress tests designed
to demonstrate the resilience of the continent’s banking system.  
 Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the largest owner of the Syncrude
project, slipped 1.6 percent to C$27.16. TransCanada Corp.,
owner of the country’s largest pipeline system, dropped 0.7
percent to C$36.60. Nuvista Energy Ltd., which is developing oil
and gas resources in western Canada, surged 7.4 percent to
C$11.38 after announcing the results of a production test at a
well in Alberta.  
 Natural Gas Purchase  
 Pengrowth slumped 6.5 percent to C$9.61 on its agreement to
buy Monterey Exploration Ltd., which owns natural gas assets in
the Montney formation in British Columbia. Monterey shareholders
would receive 0.8298 Pengrowth unit for each Monterey share.
Monterey soared 80 percent to a record C$7.74.  
 Cameco rose 4.9 percent to C$24.76 after Bloomberg News
reported China is buying unprecedented amounts of uranium.
Uranium One Inc., which produces the fuel in Kazakhstan,
increased 2.5 percent to C$2.84.  
 Most  S&P/TSX gold stocks  fell as the metal retreated 0.9
percent in New York. Eldorado Gold Corp., Canada’s fourth-
largest producer, dropped 2.8 percent to C$17.27. Iamgold Corp.,
which mines in West Africa, South America and Quebec, declined
2.1 percent to C$17.26.  
 Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the owner of Circle K and
Mac’s convenience stores, rallied 2.6 percent to C$19.86 after
extending its $1.9 billion bid for Casey’s General Stores Inc.
to Aug. 6. As of July 9, 19.2 percent of the Iowa company’s
outstanding shares had been tendered to the unsolicited offer,
Couche-Tard said.
