             CC Sabathia  pitched the New York
Yankees to an 8-2 win over the Seattle Mariners and joined
Tampa Bay’s  David Price  as the American League’s only 12-game
winners entering Major League Baseball’s All-Star break.  
 Sabathia allowed one run over seven innings yesterday in
winning his eighth straight decision for the Yankees, who have
baseball’s best record at 56-32. The reigning World Series
champions have a two-game lead over the Tampa Bay Rays in the
AL Eastern Division. The Boston Red Sox are five games back.  
 The 81st All-Star Game will be held tomorrow at Angel
Stadium in Anaheim, California. The league’s annual home run
derby is held today.  
 The Chicago White Sox carry an eight-game winning streak
into the three-day All-Star break after beating the Kansas City
Royals 15-5 yesterday. The White Sox are 49-38 and lead the
Detroit Tigers by a half-game in the AL Central.  
 The Texas Rangers (50-38) lead the All-Star-host Angels by
4 1/2 games in the AL West, even though they lost four home
games in a row to the Baltimore Orioles, who have the worst
record in the league. Texas yesterday lost 4-1 to Baltimore.  
 The Atlanta Braves have the National League’s best record
at 52-36 after yesterday’s 3-0 loss to the New York Mets. The
Braves lead the Mets by four games and are 4 1/2 games ahead of
the third-place Philadelphia Phillies.  
 The Cincinnati Reds (49-41) lead the St. Louis Cardinals
by one game in the NL Central. The Reds enter the All-Star
break on a four-game skid after being swept by the Phillies in
Philadelphia, including a 1-0 loss yesterday.  
 The San Diego Padres, at 51-37, lead the Colorado Rockies
and Los Angeles Dodgers by two games in the NL West.
