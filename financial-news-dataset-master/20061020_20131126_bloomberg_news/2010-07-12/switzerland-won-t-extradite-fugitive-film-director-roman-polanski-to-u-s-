             The Swiss government said it won’t
extradite fugitive film director  Roman Polanski  to the U.S. on
charges tied to a more than 30-year-old sex scandal in
California.  
 Polanski was released from electronic monitoring at his
chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, the Justice Ministry said today
at a press conference. Polanski, whose films include “The
Pianist” and “Chinatown,” is wanted in the U.S. for unlawful
sexual conduct with a 13-year-old girl.  
 “Mr. Polanski is able to move around freely,” Swiss
Justice Minister  Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf  said at a press
conference in Bern today. “He’s been a free man since 11:30
a.m. today. He’s free to leave.”  
 The Oscar-winning director was arrested at Zurich airport
on Sept. 26, as he arrived to collect an award at the city’s
film festival. Polanski, 76, was held in a Swiss jail before
being placed under house arrest at his holiday home. Polanski
was forced to wear an electronic monitoring tag while awaiting
the government’s decision on the U.S. extradition request.  
 The film director was initially charged on six felony
counts alleging he drugged and raped the teenager in 1977. He
later pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual conduct
with a minor after the lawyer for the girl’s family asked
prosecutors to avoid a jury trial.  
 Laura Sweeney , a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  Herve Temime , one of Polanski’s lawyers in
Paris, and his Swiss attorney Lorenz Erni, couldn’t be reached
to comment.  
 ‘Remaining Sentence’  
 “Today it’s about a remaining sentence of maximum of two
years,” Widmer-Schlumpf said. After his imprisonment and house
arrest, 10 months remain, she said. “Under consideration of all
aspects, we’ve decided to reject the extradition request.”  
 In May, Polanski lost a bid to have a California court
release testimony by a former prosecutor that he claims shows
the Los Angeles District Attorney is misleading the Swiss
government about the sentence he faces. Prosecutors said he
faces as long as two years in jail.  
 Polanski is married to French actress  Emmanuelle Seigner 
and has two children. The French-Polish dual citizen won the
Oscar for best director for the “The Pianist” in 2003.  
 The case is People of the State of California v. Roman
Polanski, A334139, California Superior Court (Los Angeles).
