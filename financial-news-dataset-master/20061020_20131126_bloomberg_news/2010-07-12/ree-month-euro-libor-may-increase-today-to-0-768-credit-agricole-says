             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may increase to 0.768 percent, said Peter Chatwell, an interest-
rates strategist in London. The rate was 0.760 percent on July
9, data from the British Bankers’ Association showed.  
 Libor for three-month dollars may slip to 0.525 percent,
Chatwell said. The rate was 0.527 percent on July 9.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may rise to 0.830 percent, he said. The rate was
0.822 percent at the end of last week, according to the European
Banking Federation.
