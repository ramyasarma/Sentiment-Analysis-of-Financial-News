             Socovesa SA , the Chilean homebuilder
and construction company, rose to a 32-month high after a report
showed that home prices in Santiago gained the most since 2001.  
 Socovesa  rose 5.1 percent to 268.96 pesos at 4:41 p.m. New
York time, the highest level since November 2007.  
 The average value of homes in or near Santiago reached in
the first quarter 2,818 “unidades de fomento,” an inflation-
indexed currency, or $111,157, up 9.1 percent compared to the
same period of 2009, Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera  wrote 
this weekend, citing a report from BBVA Chile. It’s the largest
increase since the third quarter of 2001 and the highest average
price since the fourth quarter of 2002, La Tercera wrote.
