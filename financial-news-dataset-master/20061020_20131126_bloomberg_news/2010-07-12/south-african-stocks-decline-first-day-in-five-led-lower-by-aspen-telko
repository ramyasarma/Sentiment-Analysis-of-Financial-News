             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  decreased for the first time in five days, losing
148.34, or 0.5 percent, to 27,123.97 at 11:57 a.m. in
Johannesburg. Equity trading started 1 1/2 hours late after a
technical glitch caused international connectivity problems.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.  (APN SJ) fell 1.56 rand, or
2 percent, to 75.64 rand, the biggest intraday drop in more than
a week.  Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , the Australian drug company
that has lost more than half its market value this year, said it
wants to improve its takeover offer, a week after the suitor cut
its bid.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the largest mining company,
dropped 3.51 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 209.76 rand.  Anglo
American Plc  (AGL SJ), which makes up almost 10 percent of South
Africa’s benchmark stock index, declined 4.73 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 274.42 rand. Copper dropped in London as a stronger
dollar and falling imports into China added to concerns of a
slowdown in demand.  
 Separately, Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest
mining company, said July 9 that “resource nationalism” may
spread as governments around the world seek to boost their share
of mining profits, potentially constraining supply.  
 Telkom South Africa Ltd.  (TKG SJ) slid for a fourth day,
losing 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 34.49 rand. Morgan Stanley
cut its recommendation on Africa’s largest fixed-line operator
to “equal-weight” from “overweight” and reduced its share-
price estimate to 38 rand, from 60 rand after lowering its
fiscal 2011 earnings estimate for Telkom by 31 percent.
