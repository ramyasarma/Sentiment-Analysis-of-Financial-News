             Hong Kong stocks  rose, lifting the
Hang Seng Index to a two-week high, as slowing growth in Chinese
real-estate prices raised speculation China will ease measures
to curb its property market. Developers and banks gained.  
 China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. , controlled by the
Chinese construction ministry, gained 4.4 percent. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 bank by market
value, rose 1.9 percent.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.  climbed
1.6 percent after the South China Morning Post said yesterday
the company sold about 76 percent of its Lime Stardom project.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.4 percent to 20,467.43 at the
close of trading, the highest level since June 28. The gauge has
fallen 6.4 percent this year amid worries about China’s real-
estate policies and budget deficits in Europe. Shares in the
measure are  priced  at an average 13.6 times estimated profit,
down from 18 times on Nov. 16, when the index hit its high for
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 “Rumors to ease off those mortgage restrictions might have
lifted the Chinese property stocks,” said  Khiem Do , Hong Kong-
based head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management
(Asia) Ltd., which oversees $10 billion. “Asian markets are on
the cheap side, not at bargain levels, but cheap compared to
historical levels.”  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies advanced 0.4 percent to 11,673.37.  
 Real Estate  
 China Overseas Land  surged 4.4 percent to HK$16.08. China
Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer, advanced 2.2
percent to HK$15.86.  
 Property prices in 70 Chinese cities gained 11.4 percent in
June from a year earlier, according to China Information News,
the statistic bureau’s newspaper. That compared with advances of
12.8 percent in April and 12.4 percent in May.  
 China intensified a crackdown on real estate speculation
after the country’s economy grew at an 11.9 percent  annual pace 
in the first quarter, the fastest expansion since 2007. Measures
have included raising the minimum rates of interest payable on
mortgages and raising down payment ratios on some home purchases.  
 The Southern Metropolis Daily said policy makers may loosen
limitations on third-home loans. Credit Suisse Group AG also
reported that some Chinese banks have loosened their standards
for mortgage lending.  
 ICBC climbed 1.9 percent to HK$5.83. China Construction
Bank Corp., the nation’s No. 2 bank by market value, gained 2.4
percent to HK$6.48, while Bank of China Ltd., the third largest,
advanced 1 percent to HK$4.12.  
 Insurance Stocks Drop  
 Sun Hung Kai, Hong Kong’s largest developer by market value,
rose 1.6 percent to HK$111.40. The company sold about 285 flats,
or 76 percent, of its Lime Stardom project in Hong Kong’s
district of Tai Kok Tsui on July 10, the South China Morning
Post reported yesterday, without citing anyone.  
 Chinese insurers declined after the country’s industry
regulator said July 9 it plans to allow the companies to decide
the preset interest rates. Insurers use those rates to estimate
future investment yields when pricing contracts, on
“conventional” life insurance policies. The higher the
interest rate is, the cheaper the insurance policies are for
customers.  
 China Life Insurance Co. , the nation’s biggest insurer by
market value, slumped 3.7 percent to HK$33.95. China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co., the country’s No. 3 insurer, declined 5.2
percent to HK$29.85.  
 Li & Fung Ltd. lost 0.7 percent to HK$37.55 after the
biggest supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
increased its funds for acquisitions to about $1.15 billion with
the sale of 10-year debt. The company said July 9 that it raised
$350 million selling a second batch of dollar-denominated notes
following a sale in May.  
 Chiho-Tiande Group Ltd. , which recycles scrap metal, sank
1.7 percent to HK$2.39 on its debut, after plunging as much as
17 percent and rising as much as 3.7 percent.  
 Twenty-six stocks gained while 15 fell on the 43-member
Hang Seng Index. Futures on the gauge rose 0.6 percent to 20,525.
