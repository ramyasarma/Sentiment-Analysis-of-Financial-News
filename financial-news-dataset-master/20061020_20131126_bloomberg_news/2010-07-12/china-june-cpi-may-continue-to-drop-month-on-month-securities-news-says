             Chinese consumer prices may continue
to drop in June from May as prices of agricultural products fall
on sufficient supply, the Shanghai Securities News reported,
citing an unidentified person with ties to the National
Development and Reform Commission.  
 China’s June CPI may rise 3.4 percent to 3.5 percent on the
same month a year earlier, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
China’s consumer prices may rise about 4 percent in July on year
and see slower growth in the second half, the newspaper said,
citing Zhu Baoliang, a researcher at the State Information
Center.
