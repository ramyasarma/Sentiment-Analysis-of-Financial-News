             European banks are discussing a
proposal for a 20 billion-euro ($25.3 billion) “European
Recovery Fund” that could rescue failed lenders, the Financial
Times reported, citing  UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive Officer
 Alessandro Profumo .  
 The fund would receive voluntary contributions from large
cross-border European banks and would intervene to provide
support only if European authorities determined that a lender
needed it, Profumo wrote in the FT.  
 It would provide “specific guarantees to support ailing
banks to issue secured notes,” and “would not be a resolution
fund,” Profumo wrote in the newspaper.  
 The plan will compete with other ideas for dealing with a
future financial crisis, and Profumo has already pushed his
proposal with Deutsche Bank AG and Banco Santander SA, the FT
reported.
