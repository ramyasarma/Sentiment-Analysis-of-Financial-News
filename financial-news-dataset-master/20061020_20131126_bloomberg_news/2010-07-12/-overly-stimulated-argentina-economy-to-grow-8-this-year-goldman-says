             Argentina’s economy will expand 8
percent in 2010, up from a previous forecast of 5.3 percent
because of “lax” fiscal and monetary policies, a record
harvest and higher commodities prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
economist  Alberto Ramos  said in an e-mailed report.  
 Growth  will slow to 5.8 percent next year and the economy
will face a “risk of a hard landing” in 2012, Ramos said.
I nflation  will be 25 percent this year, he said.  
 “The current growth cycle is beset with fundamental flaws
-- significant acceleration in inflation, erosion of the  current
account balance  and record-high levels of  primary spending  --
that could be a source of medium term vulnerability,” Ramos
wrote in the report. “The over-stimulation of the economy is
probably not independent of the political cycle, with the
presidential elections in late 2011.”  
 The economy, South America’s second largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that reduced growth to 0.9 percent
last year, the slowest since Argentina pulled out of a recession
in 2003. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  announced in
May an 8 billion-peso ($2.03 billion) loan program for companies
to help them boost production and exports.  
 Gross domestic product grew 6.8 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier and 3 percent from the last three
months of 2009, the National Statistics Institute said.  
 “Given the peculiarities of the current growth cycle and
the authorities’ neglect of monetary variables, inflation is
likely to reach 25 percent this year and to remain high next
year,” Ramos wrote.  
 Inflation and the deterioration of the current account will
likely push the government to allow a drop of the peso to more
than 4 pesos per dollar by year end, Ramos said.  
 In trading today, the peso was little changed at 3.9368 per
dollar at 1:56 p.m. New York time from 3.9355 on July 8.
