             China’s  Suntech Power Holdings Co. ,
the world’s largest maker of polysilicon solar-power modules,
fell the most in two months in New York after Citigroup Inc.
recommended selling the stock and said next year’s earnings may
miss analysts’ estimates.  
 Suntech declined 7 percent to $10.57, the biggest drop
since May 6.  Trina Solar Ltd. , a Changzhou, China-based maker of
solar modules, lost 2.8 percent to $20.52 after Citigroup
initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” rating.  Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. , based in Baoding, China, fell 4.4
percent to $11.86 after being rated “hold.”  
 Trina Solar and Yingli Green may report earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates next year, while Suntech may miss the
average projection, Citigroup said.  
 “Stock correlation within the group is near a record high,
but these stocks typically track estimates,” Citigroup analyst
 Timothy Arcuri  wrote in a note today. “As the Euro stabilizes
and 2011 demand is up albeit only slightly, macro fears should
give way to fundamentals in 2011 as pricing converges and cost
leaders continue to gain share.”  
 The euro has lost 12 percent against the dollar this year,
the second-biggest decline among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. Suntech has dropped 36 percent this year, while
Yingli Green has fallen 25 percent and Trina Solar lost 24
percent.
