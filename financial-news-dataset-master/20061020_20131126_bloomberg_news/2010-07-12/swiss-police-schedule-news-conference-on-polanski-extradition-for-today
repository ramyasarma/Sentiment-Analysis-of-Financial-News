             The Swiss government will hold a
press conference on the possible extradition of fugitive film
director  Roman Polanski , who fled California in 1978.  
 Swiss Justice Minister  Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf  will hold a
briefing at 2 p.m. in Bern, which will be  broadcast live  on the
government’s website, the ministry said today in an e-mailed
statement without elaborating. Polanski, whose films include
“The Pianist” and “Chinatown,” is wanted in the U.S. for
unlawful sexual conduct with a 13-year-old girl.  
 The Oscar-winning director was arrested at Zurich airport
on Sept. 26, as he arrived to collect an award at the city’s
film festival. Polanski, 76, was held in a Swiss jail before
being placed under house arrest at his holiday home in the
Alpine village of Gstaad, Switzerland. Polanski has since been
forced to wear an electronic monitoring tag while awaiting the
government’s decision on the U.S. extradition request.  
 The film director was initially charged on six felony
counts alleging he drugged and raped the teenager in 1977. He
later pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual conduct
with a minor after the lawyer for the girl’s family asked
prosecutors to avoid a jury trial.  
 The Justice Ministry declined to give details before the
press conference.  Herve Temime , one of Polanski’s lawyers in
Paris, and his Swiss attorney Lorenz Erni, couldn’t be reached
to comment.  
 Sentencing Questions  
 His lawyers have previously said that under the U.S.
extradition treaty with Switzerland, a convict may only be
extradited if he faces at least six months in prison.  
 In May, Polanski lost a bid to have a California court
release testimony by a former prosecutor that he claims shows
the Los Angeles District Attorney is misleading the Swiss
government about the sentence he faces. Prosecutors say he faces
as long as two years in jail.  
 Polanski is married to French actress  Emmanuelle Seigner 
and has two children. The French-Polish dual citizen won the
Oscar for best director for the “The Pianist” in 2003.  
 The case is People of the State of California v. Roman
Polanski, A334139, California Superior Court (Los Angeles).
