             The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 1.053
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  
 The securities, which will mature in July 2013, yielded
1.055 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. in
New York.  
 The government’s $69 billion in total sales of notes and
bonds this week compares with $70 billion for June’s offerings
of the maturities. Today’s auction is $1 billion smaller than
last month’s sale of the debt, the third reduction since before
the credit crisis.  
 At the three-year auction on June 8, the notes drew a yield
of 1.22 percent. It was the lowest level since the offering in
January 2009 yielded 1.2 percent, the least on record.  
 The June sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.23,
compared with an average of 3.06 for the past 10 auctions.  
 Indirect bidders, the class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 46.7 percent of the notes at the
June auction, compared with 50.7 percent in the previous month.
The average for the past 10 sales is 52.3 percent.  
 Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.3 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 16.5 percent in
May and an average 11.2 percent over the past 10 auctions.  
 Three-year notes have returned 3.3 percent this year,
compared with a 5.5 percent gain for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  
 The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  
 The government will sell $21 billion of 10-year debt
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 14.
