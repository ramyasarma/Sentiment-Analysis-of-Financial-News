             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
fall 17 percent to the lowest level in a year after the measure
formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, according to a technical
analyst at SEB AB.  
 “The market is going to have a tough time moving much
higher,”  Anders Soederberg , chief technical analyst at SEB in
Stockholm said today in a phone interview. “Everybody has been
looking at the big head-and-shoulders developing. If market
support erodes at 1,038-1,040, which is the neckline to this
pattern, and this time finds staying power beneath it, that puts
us back on track to reach about 900 in the next two to three
months.”  
 A head-and-shoulders pattern occurs when share prices form
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. The
start of a decline is signaled when prices fall below a support
level in line with the low points between the peaks.  
 The  S&P 500  has fallen 3.3 percent this year amid investor
concern about sovereign debt levels in Europe and slowing growth
in China. Futures on the index expiring in September fell 0.3
percent to 1,069.2 at 8:03 a.m. in New York today after the
measure rallied 5.4 percent to 1,077.96 last week.  
 “S&P trading volume increases on down days and the 50- and
200-day moving averages have had a bearish cross. Both indicate
the index is set to fall. This is the scenario we are trying to
play,” Soderberg said.  
 Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. The
trading patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
