             China’s Jilin province, the
country’s top corn grower, is expected to have near-average
temperatures and rainfall in the 10 days through July 20, the
region’s weather forecaster said.  
 The province is forecast to get 50 millimeters (2 inches)
of rain compared with an average 51.7 millimeters for the period,
the Jilin Meteorological Bureau said in a  report  on its website
yesterday. Temperatures will average 22 degrees Celsius (71.6
degrees Fahrenheit) compared with 22.4 degrees in previous years,
it said.  
 China is the world’s second-largest corn consumer and the
country’s northeast, including the provinces of Liaoning,
Jilin and Heilongjiang, accounts for almost 40 percent of the
nation’s output, according to a study by the Economic
Research Service of the USDA.  
 Corn crops in the central and west areas of Jilin are
entering the so-called elongation stage, and are developing
faster than average, the meteorological bureau’s report said.
Soybeans are flowering and are developing at a near-average pace,
it said without elaborating.  
 In the first 10 days this month, Jilin received 69.7
millimeters rain, 57 percent more than the past average, the
report said.
