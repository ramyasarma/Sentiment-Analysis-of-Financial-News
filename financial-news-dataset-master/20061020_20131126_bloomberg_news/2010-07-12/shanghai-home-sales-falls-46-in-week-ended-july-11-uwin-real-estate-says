                          July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Ben Simpfendorfer, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about the implications of sovereign debt crisis in Europe on China's exports to the region. 
     China’s unexpected rebound in overseas shipments to a record last month may lose pace as the European crisis, a moderating U.S. recovery and yuan gains curb demand for goods from the world’s largest exporter. Simpfendorfer, speaking from Hong Kong, also discusses China's currency policy and property market.
