             Uganda’s military said Somali
militants may have been responsible for two explosions in the
capital, Kampala, last night in which at least 64 people died.  
 “According to the inspector-general of police, there is
indication it’s linked to al-Shabaab,” Felix Kulayigye,
spokesman for Uganda’s army, said in a phone interview today.
“This is a terrorist act. The intention is to instil fear.”
