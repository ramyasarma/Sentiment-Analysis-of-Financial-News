             Oil may push toward $84 a barrel
based on signals from on a Japanese charting method called
Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or “one-glance cloud chart,” according to
Astmax Ltd.  
 Oil&apos;s close in New York on July 9 of $76.09 a barrel has
breached the upper edge of the Kumo, or cloud, formation between
$75.70 and $73.57 on a daily chart, a sign that prices will rise,
said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity-fund manager at Astmax in Tokyo.
Prices may be limited by the top of $80.21 on the weekly
Ichimoku graph.  
 “Moving above the cloud is a signal for the next upside
move,” Emori said. “$80 is the top range. Once we get past
that we don’t see any resistance so the market could move toward
the $84 level.”  
 Ichimoku charts, invented by Japanese journalist Goichi
Hosoda, are named after the most recognizable portion of the
graph, the cloud that forms in the gap between the Senkou lines.
These lines, also called leading spans, are derived from past
price highs and lows and plotted out 26 days ahead. They act to
identify the resistance and support levels.  
 Crude for August delivery was at $76.15 a barrel, up 6
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 11:45 a.m. Singapore time. It earlier rose as much as 34
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $76.43. Futures have climbed 5.8
percent since trading at a four-week low on July 6.  
 Besides the prospect of prices moving above the cloud, the
Ichimoku chart is showing other signs that oil might rise based
on the interaction of two lines on the graph called the Kijun-
sen, or base, and the Tankan-sen, or conversion.  
 The base line is a moving average of the past 26 days
trading and the conversion is from the past nine days.  
 Conversion Line  
 The conversion line crossed over the base figure on June 11,
considered a bullish sign comparable to the signal line rising
above the moving average convergence/divergence indicator on a
MACD chart.  
 A final signal for crude to rise is seen in the Chikou, or
lagging span, which shows the closing price projected back 26
days into the past. At $76.09 a barrel, that line is above the
June 3 closing price of $74.61.  
 “In total, three out of four key indicators are bullish,
leading us to conclude that the Ichimoku analysis is bullish
for” New York oil futures, Schork Group Inc. said a June 29 
report.
