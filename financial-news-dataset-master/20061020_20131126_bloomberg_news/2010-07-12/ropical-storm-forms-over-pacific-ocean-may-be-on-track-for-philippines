             A tropical storm formed over the
Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines, the U.S. Navy Joint
Typhoon Warning Center said.  
 Tropical Storm 3W was about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
east of Manila at 8 a.m. Manila time today, the center said on
its  website . The storm was moving west-northwest and may reach
Luzon, the country’s most populous island, in two days.  
 The storm’s maximum sustained winds were 83 kilometers per
hour and may strengthen in the next 24 hours, the center said.
Waves reached as high as 4.2 meters (14 feet).  
 Three typhoons left about 1,000 people dead in the
Philippines last year and 1.7 million needing aid, according to
the United Nations. The storms destroyed more than 40,000 houses,
mostly in Luzon.
