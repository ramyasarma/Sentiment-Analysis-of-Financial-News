gold producer said a government-ordered suspension on some

to improve its takeover offer, a week after the South African

fourth day, increasing 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 77.20 rand.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ): Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
third-largest mining company, said “resource nationalism” may
spread as governments around the world seek to boost their share
of mining profits, potentially constraining supply. BHP, the
largest mining company, advanced 4.77 rand, or 2.3 percent, to
213.27 rand.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), which makes up 10
percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock index, rose 2.15 rand,

rand, or 0.4 percent, to 281.40 rand.  
 Telkom South Africa Ltd.  (TKG SJ): Morgan Stanley cut its
recommendation on Africa’s largest fixed-line operator to
“equal-weight” from “overweight” and reduced its share-price
