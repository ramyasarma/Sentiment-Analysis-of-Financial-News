             The spot price of iron ore delivered
to China, the world’s biggest buyer of the steelmaking
ingredient, slumped to its lowest level this year as steel
production in the Asian nation slows.  
 The  cost  of 62 percent iron ore delivered to the port of
Tianjin dropped for a 15th consecutive day, declining 3 percent
to $118.10 a metric ton, according to The Steel Index. That’s
the lowest since Dec. 29. The price has tumbled 37 percent since
reaching a high for the year of $186.50 a ton on April 21.  
 Chinese iron ore buyers have been absent from the spot
market for almost a month and are shunning purchases amid
speculation of lower prices, Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty analysts
said in a report dated July 9. The steel market, the biggest
iron ore user, has weakened,  Liu Guosheng , vice chairman of
China’s Baosteel Group Corp., said in Shanghai last week.  
 Vale SA , Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  are the
biggest exporters of iron ore, making up about two-thirds of
seaborne supply. This year they moved away from a 40-year custom
of pricing supplies annually by signing quarterly contracts
based on the average cash or spot price over three months.  
 Steel output in China dropped last month and is likely to
fall again this month, Goldman Sachs JBWere said in its report.
China is the world’s biggest steel producer.
